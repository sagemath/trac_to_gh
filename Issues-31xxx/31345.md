If `K` is a number field and `S` a finite set of primes of `K`, then for any `m > 1` there is a finite multiplicative abelian group of exponent at most `m` called the `m`-Selmer group, denoted `K(S, m)`, a subgroup of `K<sup>*/(K</sup>*)^m`.

The existing method `K.selmer_group(m)` returns a list of elements of `K^*` which generate `K(S, m)`, with no access to the group structure.  There is also a utility method `K.selmer_group_iterator(m)` which I wrote ages ago to make it easy to iterate through all the elements of the group.  There is no method to determine whether a given element of `K^*` represents an element of `K(S, m)` and if so express it in terms of the generators.

For many applications of mine I have needed something better, and for `m = p` prime I have code for a function `pSelmerGroup(K, S, p)` which returns a quadruple `(KSp, KSp_gens, from_KSp, to_KS_p)` where `KSp` is an abstract vector space over `GF(p)`, `KSp_gens` is a set of elements of `K^*` which generate `K(S, p)` (similar to `K.selmer_group(S, p)`), `from_KSp` is a map from the abstract `KSp` to `K^*` (the easy one) and `to_KSp` is the harder map from a subset of `K^*` to the vector space.

Together with some utilities this is about 560 lines of code, with docstrings but no doctest yet.  I intend to add this to Sage.

There are two issues: (1) it would make sense to have `K.selmer_group(S, p)` return the quadruple as above, but this would not be backwards compatible; (2) the new functionality is only for prime `p`, not general `m`.  I have no plans for a general version, giving a finite abelian group rather than a vector space, though for elliptic curve applications the cases `m = 4`, `m = 6`, `m = 12` are all useful.  There's a version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem at play here so `m = 6` is easy using `m = 2` and `m = 3`, and `m = 12` is easy given `m = 3` and `m = 4`, while `m = 4` requires real work.  I implemented these cases some time ago in Magma, where I also implemented the prime case, so it is possible.

I am not sure how to solve the backwards compatibility issue.  Places in Sage itself will be easy to handle (there are not many), but to avoid breaking user code will be harder unless I use a new name for the new method, perhaps `K.selmer_space(S, p)`, though "Selmer space" is not standard terminology.

The main new code is in a new file selmer_group.py, with interface via new methods selmer_space for both number fields and the rational field.

Towards the backwards compatibility, here is what I did:  I changed the name of the existing method selmer_group (in those two places and in polynomial_quotient_ring) to selmer_generators, but also for compatibility added an alias in all three places so that the method selmer_group still works.  In a small number of places where the old selmer_group method was used I changed it to selmer_generators.

I think there will be a couple of follow-up tickets to sort out things I spotted but which I did not want to complicate this ticket with. (1) Where the selmer_generators method is used in (elliptic curve) gal_rep_number_field, it is possible that the loop should be through all nontrivial elements of the selmer group, not just the generators. (2) In the etale algebra code in polynomial_quotient_ring, written (I think) ages ago by Robert Miller, there should be a non-hidden method to compute the decomposition as a sum of number fields, which does not refer to any set S of primes; and the hidden function which does this now looks rather inefficiently coded as well as probably being incorrect (at one point it computes an isomorphism from a field D_abs to itself but I think it means to compute one from D to D_abs or vice versa).  Those two issues are best dealt with *after* this is merged.

I do have some application of my own waiting in the wings which will use this new improved Selmer group.

Not yet fixed.  Currently I just use assignment selmer_group = selmer_group_generators and to implement this suggestion I think it would have to be a genuine separate method with full docstring, which I have not yet done.

Oops, I left in what I had from when it was a separate piece of my own code.  I copied from number_field.py (changing name).

It's an internal function, so no -- but I put in I.abs() for the case where I is an integer rather than an ideal.  But this is an internal function so does not do checking of its input.  I have also added an underscore prefix to the function name, and also for the two coords_in functions.

Thanks for catching that, I have put in tthe second part of the test for being p-torsion, which also ensures that the division is exact.  This should not matter in practice since the function will only be called with ideals whose p'th power is principal, but it is still good to check properly.

Check added.

Fixed

Fixed.

OK, I have fixed all but the deprecation, which I will come back to after building the documentation to check on all the docstrings.

OK, I removed the additional deprecation warnings introduced, converted the NOTE block cross-referencing to selmer_space into a SEEALSO block, and added a similar SEEALSO block for the RationalField case.

I hope this can finally be given a green light now!

Fixed.  I think.  I'm sure this is the indentation I put in originally, then I saw an error message and changed it.

This sort of error is extremely tedious to fix since the error message is insufficient and it takes 5-10 minutes for each "make" even if you only touch one file.
