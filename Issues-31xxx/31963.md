#29326, renaming `affine_hull` to `affine_hull_projection`, was merged in 9.1 (released May 21, 2020).

We replace this alias by a new method `affine_hull` that ... computes the affine hull as a polyhedron defined by just the equations. This will conform to the ABC for convex sets (#31919)

As a courtesy, if unknown keyword arguments are passed, we point users to the renamed method.

Otherwise it's good to go. Had a green bot weeks ago and everything still works.
