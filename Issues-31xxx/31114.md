We add a files `repology.txt` for each "SPKG" with its
name or names on [repology.org](https://repology.org).

This can save time when

- adding package information for an already supported or new distro
- checking for new versions of packages

We make `./sage -info packagename` print out
the resulting links to repology.

Thus they are also formatted as part of the SPKG documentation
that goes into the reference manual (#29655).
