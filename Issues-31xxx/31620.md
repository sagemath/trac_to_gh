Follow up to #30476: Using `jupyter kernelspec` to install `sagemath` kernel results in copying about 2Gb of documentation into the jupyter kernels share directory. That's generally not the spot to put large files/documentation. Document how to avoid this.

The procedure to follow would be something like:
* Use `sage -sh -c 'ls -d $SAGE_LOCAL/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath'` to find location of sagemath kernel to install
* Use `jupyter --paths` to find eligible data locations (for a "user" install, there will likely be something like `$HOME/.local/share/jupyter` there.
* Installing the sagemath kernel should then amount to something like

```
ln -s `sage -sh -c 'ls -d $SAGE_LOCAL/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath'` $HOME/.local/share/jupyter
```
We may want to check/refine these instructions to be a little more robust and/or appropriate for other operating systems, but having this documented in an easily discovered place would help. These instructions should probaly be placed or linked to in `src/doc/en/installation/launching.rst`

I don't think it's something people need to do very often, so they'd need to look up how to do it anyway. As long as it's easily discovered and a readily copy-pastable formula, I don't think it's so bad if it's a little long. At least it's transparent what is going on for someone with generic bash skills. Let's first get this documented. It's a safe and easy change, so we can still include it in 9.3. Then it'll be up on `sagemath.org` in the near future and then hopefully search engines can pick it up.
