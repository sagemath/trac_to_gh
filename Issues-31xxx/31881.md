From #30832:

We extend the `RealSet` constructors (default constructor and `RealSet.open` etc.) so that they can optionally build manifold objects; for example if `structure` or `name` is passed. This is done via chart pullbacks (#31688).

We deprecate the global bindings `RealLine` and `OpenInterval` (which will remain available through the `manifolds` catalog).

This will help make the functionality more discoverable. There are just too many global constructors: `Reals`, `RealLine`, `RealSet`, `RealInterval`, `OpenInterval`.

This is intended because `RealLine` fully specifies the object (the set of real numbers endowed with the canonical manifold structure), while `Manifold(1, name='A')` does not (since there are two distinct manifolds of dimension 1: the real line and the circle). Hence `RealLine` has `UniqueRepresentation` behavior, while `Manifold` has not.

Agreed.

> This will help make the functionality more discoverable. There are just too many global constructors: `Reals`, `RealLine`, `RealSet`, `RealInterval`, `OpenInterval`.


Indeed!

I agree with this mathematical point, but on the implementation side you have additional mutable structure, namely the family of declared subsets, on every manifold. This makes the question of identity trickier.

 From #30832:
 
-We extend the `RealSet` constructors (default constructor and `RealSet.open` etc.) so that they can optionally build manifold objects; for example if `structure` or `name` is passed.
+We extend the `RealSet` constructors (default constructor and `RealSet.open` etc.) so that they can optionally build manifold objects; for example if `structure` or `name` is passed. This is done via chart pullbacks (#31688).
 
 We deprecate the global bindings `RealLine` and `OpenInterval` (which will remain available through the `manifolds` catalog).

I agree that triggering it with `name` and `latex_name` may be too subtle.

OTOH, I think if `ambient` is passed, `structure` should be implied.

How about the parameters `coordinate`, `names`, `start_index`?

`coordinate` should be clear but the rest seems similarly ambiguous to me.

Strangely, `RealSet` does not have a shortcut constructor for the whole real line - one has to write `RealSet(-oo, oo)`. 

We can add one here on this ticket. `RealSet.real_line()`, `RealSet.universe()`, ...? Any preference?

The explanation in the `INPUT` block should now be modified accordingly, mentioning that (only) `ambient`, `coordinate`, `names` trigger manifold constructions without imposing `structure=differentiable`.

Perhaps an example where the new error message is invoked might be a good idea, too.

I like both. But to keep some similarity with the previous constructor name `RealLine`, I'd say `RealSet.real_line()` should definitely be on the list.
