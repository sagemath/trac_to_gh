From #30832:

We extend the `RealSet` constructors (default constructor and `RealSet.open` etc.) so that they can optionally build manifold objects; for example if `structure` or `name` is passed. This is done via chart pullbacks (#31688).

We deprecate the global bindings `RealLine` and `OpenInterval` (which will remain available through the `manifolds` catalog).

This will help make the functionality more discoverable. There are just too many global constructors: `Reals`, `RealLine`, `RealSet`, `RealInterval`, `OpenInterval`.

This is intended because `RealLine` fully specifies the object (the set of real numbers endowed with the canonical manifold structure), while `Manifold(1, name='A')` does not (since there are two distinct manifolds of dimension 1: the real line and the circle). Hence `RealLine` has `UniqueRepresentation` behavior, while `Manifold` has not.

Agreed.

Indeed!

I agree with this mathematical point, but on the implementation side you have additional mutable structure, namely the family of declared subsets, on every manifold. This makes the question of identity trickier.

<a id='comment:23'></a>That is much better, thank you. Minor things:

- Perhaps it is good to clarify in the docstring that `RealSet` now acts as a constructor.
- I am not sure whether I like that `RealSet(0, 1, name='A')` returns a manifold object. This is too subtle imho. Perhaps an error message is more appropriate, explaining that e.g. `structure=differentiable` is necessary to pass in those cases?

I agree that triggering it with `name` and `latex_name` may be too subtle.

OTOH, I think if `ambient` is passed, `structure` should be implied.

How about the parameters `coordinate`, `names`, `start_index`?

In connection to this, having something like `R.<t> = RealLine()` was very handy, especially when dealing with curves on manifolds. How do you plan to replace it with the `RealSet` syntax?

`coordinate` should be clear but the rest seems similarly ambiguous to me.

Strangely, `RealSet` does not have a shortcut constructor for the whole real line - one has to write `RealSet(-oo, oo)`. 

We can add one here on this ticket. `RealSet.real_line()`, `RealSet.universe()`, ...? Any preference?

The explanation in the `INPUT` block should now be modified accordingly, mentioning that (only) `ambient`, `coordinate`, `names` trigger manifold constructions without imposing `structure=differentiable`.

Perhaps an example where the new error message is invoked might be a good idea, too.

Replying to [comment:27 mkoeppe]:

I like both. But to keep some similarity with the previous constructor name `RealLine`, I'd say `RealSet.real_line()` should definitely be on the list.
