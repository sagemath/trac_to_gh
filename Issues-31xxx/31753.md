There is a bug in the computation of the characteristic polynomial over a discrete valuation ring.

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[[]]
sage: M = matrix(3, 3, [1, t + O(t^3), t^2,
....:                   1 + t + O(t^3), 2 + t^2, 3 + 2*t + O(t^3),
....:                   t - t^2, 2*t, 1 + t])
sage: M.charpoly()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'PlusInfinity' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
Hessenberg form only possible for matrices over a field
```

Expected:

```
sage: M.charpoly()
x^3 + (1 + 4*t + 4*t^2 + O(t^3))*x^2 + (t + 2*t^2 + O(t^3))*x + 3 + 2*t^2 + O(t^3)
```

This ticket fixes that.

**a.**

The patchbot reports an incorrect Trac link. To fix it:

```diff
-    We check that trac:`31753` is resolved::
+    We check that :trac:`31753` is resolved::
```


**b.**

Your fix for the bug seems to consist in removing `m` from a `cdef` declaration.

Can you explain why that caused a problem, and why this is a good solution?

But probably someone who knows more Cython than me should review that part.

It's just because `precision_relative` can return `+Infinity` which cannot be cast to an integer (in fact an element of type `Py_ssize_t`). Removing the declaration, we let python handle this.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

Right, `m` can be infinity. That's why `maxi` is also
left out of the `cdef`. Is there a cdef type for
Python or Sage objects that could be used?
Perhaps not crucial, as the inner loop matters most.

Still, about `cdef` lines, maybe remove the one about `c`
and add `entry` to the `RingElement` one?
