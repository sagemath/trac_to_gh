As reported in #30378#comment:49

Observed:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
b*epsilon
```

Expected:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
(a) + (b)*x + Order(x^2)
```

OK, I think I understand the problem, so this ticket is ready for review.

The reason I was confused is that there were 2 different bugs. Both of them are triggered by the fact that my code performed the unnecessary substitution `epsilon=epsilon`. 

Any substitution for the variable `epsilon` is considered to be an evaluation of the series, so the `O(epsilon^2)` term is deleted.  That mistake in my code is fixed by this pull request.

The substitution for `epsilon` also triggered a different bug that has been around since at least 9.1. I opened #31554 for this old bug, which is what deleted the `a` term.

This PR removes the patch that was added in #30378 (and modified by the original PR on this ticket).  Instead, it fixes the problem by patching pynac's `power::subs` method in the same way that the fix for #9891 patched the `container<C>::subs` method. This may cause doctest failures due to changed output, but it should not cause any mathematical errors.

I did not know anything about pynac (or C++) when we first started discussing the problem in #30378 eight months ago. Now that I have some experience, I don't think it will be difficult for me to properly eliminate this issue (and some others) by modifying pynac's `subs` methods.  (Related ticket: #25447.)  It's too late for this release cycle, though, so I think we should use this band-aid for now.
