As reported in [#30378 comment:49](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30378#comment:49)

Observed:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
b*epsilon
```

Expected:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
(a) + (b)*x + Order(x^2)
```

OK, I think I understand the problem, so this ticket is ready for review.

The reason I was confused is that there were 2 different bugs. Both of them are triggered by the fact that my code performed the unnecessary substitution `epsilon=epsilon`. 

Any substitution for the variable `epsilon` is considered to be an evaluation of the series, so the `O(epsilon^2)` term is deleted.  That mistake in my code is fixed by this pull request.

The substitution for `epsilon` also triggered a different bug that has been around since at least 9.1. I opened #31554 for this old bug, which is what deleted the `a` term. (The bug was triggered because the substitution is performed inside a hold context, in order to avoid the problem described in [#30378 comment:32](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30378#comment:32).)

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
Pynac is buggy inside a hold context (see #31597), so I don't think we can use the solution that is in the current branch.

I thought we could get around the problem by using named variables, but I realized this may also give wrong answers. Variables may have a domain or be involved in assumptions, and this can affect the allowable simplifications. If we replace a variable with a new variable that does not match the original data, then incorrect simplifications may be triggered (if it is not in a hold context). 

I should be able to write a small pynac patch that fixes the specific problem in #30378 (without the bug that is on this ticket), but I think that anything more substantial will have to wait for 9.4, unless someone else has good ideas.

This PR removes the patch that was added in #30378 (and modified by the original PR on this ticket).

I did not know anything about pynac (or C++) when we first started discussing the problem in #30378 eight months ago.
