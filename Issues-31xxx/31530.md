As reported in ticket:30378#comment:49

Observed:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
b*epsilon
```

Expected:

```
sage: a, b, epsilon = SR.var('a, b, epsilon')
sage: (a + b*epsilon).series(epsilon, 2).subs(a=a, b=b)
(a) + (b)*x + Order(x^2)
```

Pynac is buggy inside a hold context (see #31597), so I don't think we can use the solution that is in the current branch.

I thought we could get around the problem by using named variables, but I realized this may also give wrong answers. Variables may have a domain or be involved in assumptions, and this can affect the allowable simplifications. If we replace a variable with a new variable that does not match the original data, then incorrect simplifications may be triggered (if it is not in a hold context). 

I should be able to write a small pynac patch that fixes the specific problem in #30378 (without the bug that is on this ticket), but I think that anything more substantial will have to wait for 9.4, unless someone else has good ideas.

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nThis PR removes the patch that was added in #30378 (and modified by the original PR on this ticket).  Instead, it fixes the problem by patching pynac's `power::subs` method in the same way that the fix for #9891 patched the `container<C>::subs` method. This may cause doctest failures due to changed output, but it should not cause any mathematical errors.\n\nI did not know anything about pynac (or C++) when we first started discussing the problem in #30378 eight months ago. Now that I have some experience, I don't think it will be difficult for me to properly eliminate this issue (and some others) by modifying pynac's `subs` methods.  (Related ticket: #25447.)  It's too late for this release cycle, though, so I think we should use this band-aid for now.",

This PR removes the patch that was added in #30378 (and modified by the original PR on this ticket).  Instead, it fixes the problem by patching pynac's `power::subs` method in the same way that the fix for #9891 patched the `container<C>::subs` method. This may cause doctest failures due to changed output, but it should not cause any mathematical errors.

I did not know anything about pynac (or C++) when we first started discussing the problem in #30378 eight months ago. Now that I have some experience, I don't think it will be difficult for me to properly eliminate this issue (and some others) by modifying pynac's `subs` methods.  (Related ticket: #25447.)  It's too late for this release cycle, though, so I think we should use this band-aid for now.
