<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello Sebastian,

I went over the ticket, and everything looks fine (except a minor typo in the docstring of _coerce_impl: "pur" should be "pure").

I will run the doctests later this week just to be sure that nothing is suddenly broken, and then I will change it to positive review (after the typo is fixed).
