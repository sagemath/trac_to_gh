Keywords: FDerivativeOperator

Define a function and its derivative:

```
sage: U = function('U')
sage: U(x).diff(x)
diff(U(x), x)
sage: U(x).diff(x).operator()
D[0](U)
```
Before this ticket:

```
sage: U(x).diff(x).operator() == U(x).diff(x).operator()
False
```
After this ticket:

```
sage: U(x).diff(x).operator() == U(x).diff(x).operator()
True
```
