This is confusing:

```
sage: for E in J0(37).decomposition(): print(E.rank())
2
2
```

since the two E's in here -- as modular abelian varieties -- have Mordell-Weil ranks 0 and 1.

The problem is that the "rank" method is getting inherited from somewhere (modular symbols, modules?).   It would be better to just raise an error than do the above.
