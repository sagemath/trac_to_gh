I feel stupid, but what is the name of the backend?  I have

```
sage: MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="SCIP")
...
ValueError: 'solver' should be set to 'GLPK', 'GLPK/exact', 'Coin', 'CPLEX', 'CVXOPT', 'Gurobi', 'PPL', 'InteractiveLP', None (in which case the default one is used), or a callable.
```

this is the default now,no need to supply it explicitly. cf #32390

the problem is elsewhere

It seems that SCIP forgets the type of variables upon copying:

```
sage: P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="GLPK")
sage: x = P.new_variable(binary=True)
sage: P.add_constraint(x[0] + x[1] <= 1)
sage: P
Boolean Program (no objective, 2 variables, 1 constraint)
sage: copy(P)
Boolean Program (no objective, 2 variables, 1 constraint)
```
versus

```
sage: P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="SCIP")
sage: x = P.new_variable(binary=True)
sage: P.add_constraint(x[0] + x[1] <= 1)
sage: P
Boolean Program (no objective, 2 variables, 1 constraint)
sage: copy(P)
Linear Program (no objective, 2 variables, 1 constraint)

sage: copy(P).show()
Maximization:
  

Constraints:
  c1: x1 + x2 <= 1.0
Variables:
  x1 = x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=1.0)
  x2 = x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=1.0)
