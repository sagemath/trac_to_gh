Taking the cartesian product of differentiable manifolds treats them as merely topological spaces.

```
sage: I = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 1)

This can be improved.

Indeed, Cartesian products of manifolds are not implemented yet. The method `cartesian_product` inherited from the category framework works somehow:

```
sage: I = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 1)                                                              
sage: II = I.cartesian_product(I)                                                                   
sage: II.an_element()                                                                               
(Point on the Real interval (0, 1), Point on the Real interval (0, 1))
```
However the outcome is not a manifold:

```
sage: II.atlas()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'atlas'
```
I guess the outcome shall belong to a subclass of a manifold class, keeping track of the fact it is a Cartesian product. What is the usage in Sage? For instance, we have

```
sage: V = QQ^2                                                                                      
sage: V                                                                                             
Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: VV = V.cartesian_product(V)                                                                   
sage: VV                                                                                            
The Cartesian product of (Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field, 
 Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field)
sage: dim(V)                                                                                        
2
sage: dim(VV)                                                                                       
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute '_indices'
```
So it seems that the Cartesian product of vector spaces is not considered as a vector space.

That's right, also vector spaces are missing a specialization of this method. However, combinatorial free modules have an implementation:

I know this is out of scope of this ticket, but I wanted to just say that for normal vector spaces, one way to do it would be to simply redirect to `direct_sum`.

Maybe it's a good idea to directly implement the more general case of a fibred product $M \times_N M'$ for smooth maps $f, f': M \to N$ (one of them being a submersion). The charts are a bit more complicated, but this more general situation occurs quite often.
