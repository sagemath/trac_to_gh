Taking the cartesian product of differentiable manifolds treats them as merely topological spaces.

```

Indeed, Cartesian products of manifolds are not implemented yet. The method `cartesian_product` inherited from the category framework works somehow:

```
sage: I = manifolds.OpenInterval(0, 1)                                                              
sage: II = I.cartesian_product(I)                                                                   
sage: II.an_element()                                                                               
(Point on the Real interval (0, 1), Point on the Real interval (0, 1))
```
However the outcome is not a manifold:

```
sage: II.atlas()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'atlas'
```
I guess the outcome shall belong to a subclass of a manifold class, keeping track of the fact it is a Cartesian product. What is the usage in Sage? For instance, we have

```
sage: V = QQ^2                                                                                      
sage: V                                                                                             
Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: VV = V.cartesian_product(V)                                                                   
sage: VV                                                                                            
The Cartesian product of (Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field, 
 Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field)
sage: dim(V)                                                                                        
2
sage: dim(VV)                                                                                       
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute '_indices'
```
So it seems that the Cartesian product of vector spaces is not considered as a vector space.

Thanks for the reference.

Sounds good.

Still, one question remains: should our new manifold keep track of changes in the factors or not? The former could result in quite annoying code-writing.

Good idea. We should make it possible to turn (mutable) manifolds into immutable objects anyway. But I assume that needs a refactoring of the current use of `UniqueRepresentation`.

Similarly for vector bundles (and their tensor products) btw.

Still on my to-do list........

`@`gh-mjungmath There are a lot of things that "change" the manifold. Thus, there would be a lot of methods that need to be altered to have immutability checks. There are also questions like, "Does creating a new k-form change the manifold?" In many ways, no, but it becomes tied to the manifold as it changes `_vector_field_modules` attribute. Plus it is something you would want to naturally lift up to the product manifold.
