In version 9.3.rc5, the call `PrimitiveGroup(2500, 1)` raises a `NotImplementedError: Only the primitive groups of degree less than 2500 are available in GAP's database`, even though the primitive groups are available up to degree 4095.

The exception is raised by the wrong degree limit in line 2489 of local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py

We drop any hardcoded limit from sage and let GAP handle errors if the input is beyond the known range.

We should clarify that in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#reporting-bugs

> Though there should be proper credit for the reporter, especially bugs!
