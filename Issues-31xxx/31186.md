It should be, rather than having each package define it if it wants it. It is used here:

```
% git grep MACOSX_VERSION build/pkgs/
build/pkgs/curl/spkg-install.in:    if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
build/pkgs/curl/spkg-install.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang and --with-darwinssl."
build/pkgs/pari/spkg-install.in:MACOSX_VERSION=`uname -r | awk -F. '{print $1}'`
build/pkgs/pari/spkg-install.in:if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 14 ]; then
build/pkgs/psutil/spkg-install.in:if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ] && [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
build/pkgs/psutil/spkg-install.in:    echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
build/pkgs/python3/spkg-build.in:    if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
build/pkgs/python3/spkg-build.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
build/pkgs/r/spkg-install.in:    if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 14 ]; then
build/pkgs/r/spkg-install.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Configuring R without aqua support."
build/pkgs/r/spkg-install.in:    if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
build/pkgs/r/spkg-install.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
```
It is defined in `src/bin/sage-env` (and also in `build/pkgs/pari/spkg-install.in`).
