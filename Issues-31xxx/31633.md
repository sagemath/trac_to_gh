```
The method `VectorField.__call__` implements the action *v(f)* of a vector field *v* on a scalar field *f*, as a derivation. It is reimplemented here to simply return *df(v)*, i.e. the differential of *f* acting on *v* as a 1-form. Actually, the current code of this method contains the comment:

```
        #!# Could it be simply
        # return scalar.differential()(self)
        # ?
```
git blame reveals that this comment dates back to 2015. It is time to make the change, thereby simplifying the code and avoiding some code duplication.

Nice! It's good to reduce code and get rid of duplication!

Two things:

- What exactly caused the change

   ```diff
        sage: isinstance(Tp, FiniteRankFreeModule)
        True
        sage: sorted(Tp.bases(), key=str)
   -    [Basis (d/dr,d/dph) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2,
   -     Basis (e_r,e_ph) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2,
   +    [Basis (e_r,e_ph) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2,
         Basis (e_x,e_y) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2]
   ```

- It is possible to combine raw strings and f-strings:

   ```diff
   -                latex_name = r"{}\left({}\right)".format(self._latex_name,
   -                                                         scalar._latex_name)
   +                latex_name = fr"{self._latex_name}\left({scalar._latex_name}\right)"
   ```

It's because in the previous `VectorFieldParal.__call__` code, the computation was performed as v<sup>i</sup> df/dx<sup>i</sup> in all possible coordinate frames d/dx<sup>i</sup>, thereby triggering the evaluation of v in these frames. In the new code, the computation is performed as (df)<sub>i</sub> v<sup>i</sup> in a single frame (and not necessarily a coordinate one). In the specific example above, `v(F)` in line 577 of `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus/vector_calc_plane.rst` triggered the computation of v in the coordinate frame `(d/dr, d/dph)`; this was done in line 1779 of the old (i.e. 9.3.rc2) file `vectorfield.py`:

```
                self_r.comp(chart._frame)
```
Then `vp = v.at(p)` in line 634 of `vector_calc_plane.rst` created the basis `(d/dr, d/dph)` in `Tp`; this was done by `frame.at(point)` in line 2109 of `tensorfield_paral.py`:

```
            comp_resu = resu.add_comp(frame.at(point))
```
This explains why `Tp` had the extra basis `(d/dr, d/dph)` with the old code. It was a side effect of an unnecessary calculation in the old `VectorFieldParal.__call__`.

> It's because in the previous `VectorFieldParal.__call__` code, the computation was performed as v<sup>i</sup> df/dx<sup>i</sup> in all possible coordinate frames d/dx<sup>i</sup>, thereby triggering the evaluation of v in these frames. In the new code, the computation is performed as (df)<sub>i</sub> v<sup>i</sup> in a single frame (and not necessarily a coordinate one). In the specific example above, `v(F)` in line 577 of `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus/vector_calc_plane.rst` triggered the computation of v in the coordinate frame `(d/dr, d/dph)`; this was done in line 1779 of the old (i.e. 9.3.rc2) file `vectorfield.py`:

> Then `vp = v.at(p)` in line 634 of `vector_calc_plane.rst` created the basis `(d/dr, d/dph)` in `Tp`; this was done by `frame.at(point)` in line 2109 of `tensorfield_paral.py`:

That's indeed an improvement. Sweet!

Great. I'll give it a positive review as soon as patchbot is green.
