The method `VectorField.__call__` implements the action *v(f)* of a vector field *v* on a scalar field *f*, as a derivation. It is reimplemented here to simply return *df(v)*, i.e. the differential of *f* acting on *v* as a 1-form. Actually, the current code of this method contains the comment:

```
        #!# Could it be simply
        # return scalar.differential()(self)
        # ?
```
git blame reveals that this comment dates back to 2015. It is time to make the change, thereby simplifying the code and avoiding some code duplication.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Nice! It's good to reduce code and get rid of duplication!

Two things:

- What exactly caused the change

   {{{#!diff
     sage: isinstance(Tp, FiniteRankFreeModule)
     True
     sage: sorted(Tp.bases(), key=str)
-    [Basis (d/dr,d/dph) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2,
-     Basis (e_r,e_ph) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2,

      Basis (e_x,e_y) on the Tangent space at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2]
   }}}

- It is possible to combine raw strings and f-strings:

   {{{#!diff

-                                                         scalar._latex_name)

It's because in the previous `VectorFieldParal.__call__` code, the computation was performed as v<sup>i</sup> df/dx<sup>i</sup> in all possible coordinate frames d/dx<sup>i</sup>, thereby triggering the evaluation of v in these frames. In the new code, the computation is performed as (df)<sub>i</sub> v<sup>i</sup> in a single frame (and not necessarily a coordinate one). In the specific example above, `v(F)` in line 577 of `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus/vector_calc_plane.rst` triggered the computation of v in the coordinate frame `(d/dr, d/dph)`; this was done in line 1779 of the old (i.e. 9.3.rc2) file `vectorfield.py`:

```
                self_r.comp(chart._frame)
```
Then `vp = v.at(p)` in line 634 of `vector_calc_plane.rst` created the basis `(d/dr, d/dph)` in `Tp`; this was done by `frame.at(point)` in line 2109 of `tensorfield_paral.py`:

```
            comp_resu = resu.add_comp(frame.at(point))
```
This explains why `Tp` had the extra basis `(d/dr, d/dph)` with the old code. It was a side effect of an unnecessary calculation in the old `VectorFieldParal.__call__`.
