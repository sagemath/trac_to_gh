`self.intersection(other)` should be a subset of any `self_superset.intersection(other_superset)`.

This will be useful in particular if some pair `self_superset`, `other_superset` is known to be disjoint.

This could also provide another test for `Point.__eq__`: if the parents of the points have an empty intersection, the points must be unequal. (I don't know how useful this is.)


Checking an antichain of `self_superset`s against an antichain of `other_supersets` takes quadratic time. But speed ups for chains are possible by convolution/binary search.
