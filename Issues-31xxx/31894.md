Currently:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2
sage: c_cart.category()
Category of objects
```
A `Chart` instance (with non-periodic coordinates) is a continuous map from its domain to `R^n`. This should be reflected in the category.

With this ticket:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological') 
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2 
sage: c_cart.category() 
Category of elements of 
 Set of Morphisms 
  from 2-dimensional topological manifold R^2 
  to Vector space of dimension 2 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision 
  in Category of sets
```

Also:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex', structure='topological') 
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=lambda x,y: [abs(x)<1, y!=0]) 
sage: X.codomain()                                                                                                                                                                                   
{ (x, y) âˆˆ Vector space of dimension 2 over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision : abs(x) < 1, y != 0 }
```

To put the map in a better category than `Sets` will need some follow-up tickets.

I have two possible variants:

- as of [acdb6a7](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/acdb6a72596070154f7a724ede91758c1fd11159), the codomain of the `Chart` is a fundamental cell of the periodic coordinate space.

Corestricted like this, the chart is bijective, with a bijective `ChartInverse` as its inverse. But it does not capture the fact that one is also allowed to use coordinates outside of the fundamental domain to construct a point.

- with [243fcfd](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/243fcfda7112c8372e2cbfab058aba5335b0aff5) + work in progress (not on the branch yet), the `ChartInverse` is a surjection from the full coordinate space to the chart's domain, and `Chart` is a section map of the `ChartInverse`.

I don't know which of the two you would find preferable and also cannot speak to Travis' suggestion regarding possible changes to the design.
