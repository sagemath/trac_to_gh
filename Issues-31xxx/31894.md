Currently:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2
sage: c_cart.category()
Category of objects
```
A `Chart` instance (with non-periodic coordinates) is a continuous map from its domain to `R^n`. This should be reflected in the category.

With this ticket:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological') 
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2 
sage: c_cart.category() 
Category of elements of 
 Set of Morphisms 
  from 2-dimensional topological manifold R^2 
  to Vector space of dimension 2 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision 
  in Category of sets
```

Also:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex', structure='topological') 
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=lambda x,y: [abs(x)<1, y!=0]) 
sage: X.codomain()                                                                                                                                                                                   
{ (x, y) âˆˆ Vector space of dimension 2 over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision : abs(x) < 1, y != 0 }
```

To put the map in a better category than `Sets` will need some follow-up tickets.

Corestricted like this, the chart is bijective, with a bijective `ChartInverse` as its inverse. But it does not capture the fact that one is also allowed to use coordinates outside of the fundamental domain to construct a point.

- with [243fcfd](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=243fcfda7112c8372e2cbfab058aba5335b0aff5) + work in progress (not on the branch yet), the `ChartInverse` is a surjection from the full coordinate space to the chart's domain, and `Chart` is a section map of the `ChartInverse`.

I don't know which of the two you would find preferable and also cannot speak to Travis' suggestion regarding possible changes to the design.

What we can do is that the user has to state the fundamental domain (which currently happens up to boundary only). Or *we* provide which boundary component belongs to the fundamental domain (I opt for the lower bound). Then it is clear which points the section map has to map to.

For the 1-sphere this could be for example the clopen interval `[-pi,pi)`. Then it becomes clear that the point on the 1-sphere determined by `pi` is mapped to `-pi` via the (section) chart. Similarly then for any other point.

The only obstruction I see right now is that the symbolic ring doesn't provide any modulo operation in the spirit of `x - y*floor(x/y)`. Or does it?

Typically, when the geodesic is an orbit around some center, the azimuthal coordinate returned by the integrator increases without any bound, instead of being confined to [0, 2\pi). Here are some [examples in Kerr spacetime](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/BHLectures/blob/master/sage/Kerr_geod_plots.ipynb).

Periodic charts are useful in practice. Otherwise, we could have lived without them, sticking to the standard definition of a chart on a manifold.

Thank you. It's clear now. It was my fault yesterday...
