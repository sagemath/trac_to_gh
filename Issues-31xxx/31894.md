Currently:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2
sage: c_cart.category()
Category of objects
```
A `Chart` instance (with non-periodic coordinates) is a continuous map from its domain to `R^n`. This should be reflected in the category.

With this ticket:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological') 
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2 
sage: c_cart.category() 
Category of elements of 
 Set of Morphisms 
  from 2-dimensional topological manifold R^2 
  to Vector space of dimension 2 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision 
  in Category of sets
```

Also:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex', structure='topological') 
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(coord_restrictions=lambda x,y: [abs(x)<1, y!=0]) 
sage: X.codomain()                                                                                                                                                                                   
{ (x, y) âˆˆ Vector space of dimension 2 over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision : abs(x) < 1, y != 0 }
```

To put the map in a better category than `Sets` will need some follow-up tickets.

I have two possible variants:

- as of [acdb6a7](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/acdb6a72596070154f7a724ede91758c1fd11159), the codomain of the `Chart` is a fundamental cell of the periodic coordinate space. Presumably the user declares the periodic coordinates in a way that the computed coordinates always lie in the fundamental domain. Corestricted like this, the chart is bijective, with a bijective `ChartInverse` as its inverse. But it does not capture the fact that one is also allowed to use coordinates outside of the fundamental domain to construct a point.

- with [243fcfd](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/243fcfda7112c8372e2cbfab058aba5335b0aff5) + work in progress (not on the branch yet), the `ChartInverse` is a surjection from the full coordinate space to the chart's domain, and `Chart` is a section map of the `ChartInverse`.

I don't know which of the two you would find preferable and also cannot speak to Travis' suggestion regarding possible changes to the design.

But then we have to make a choice, right? The current situation is as follows (for example):

```
sage: S1 = manifolds.Sphere(1)
sage: spher = S1.spherical_coordinates()
sage: p = S1.point((pi,))
sage: q = S1.point((-pi,))
sage: spher(p)
(pi,)
sage: spher(q)
(-pi,)

At current stage, this is not a well-defined map.

What we can do is that the user has to state the fundamental domain (which currently happens up to boundary only). Or *we* provide which boundary component belongs to the fundamental domain (I opt for the lower bound). Then it is clear which points the section map has to map to.

For the 1-sphere this could be for example the clopen interval `[-pi,pi)`. Then it becomes clear that the point on the 1-sphere determined by `pi` is mapped to `-pi` via the (section) chart. Similarly then for any other point.

The only obstruction I see right now is that the symbolic ring doesn't provide any modulo operation in the spirit of `x - y*floor(x/y)`. Or does it?

> > Just a word of context about periodic charts: they have been introduced because they are useful when computing a geodesic with some [numerical integrator](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/integrated_curve.html). Typically, when the geodesic is an orbit around some center, the azimuthal coordinate returned by the integrator increases without any bound, instead of being confined to [0, 2\pi). Here are some [examples in Kerr spacetime](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/BHLectures/blob/master/sage/Kerr_geod_plots.ipynb).

Periodic charts are useful in practice. Otherwise, we could have lived without them, sticking to the standard definition of a chart on a manifold.
