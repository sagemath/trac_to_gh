We define cython aliases `OPENMP_CFLAGS` and `OPENMP_CXXFLAGS`.

They must be used as `extra_link_args` and `extra_compile_args` to get `cython.parallel` to work in parallel.

If they are empty, `cython.parallel.prange` will still compile and work (but not in parallel). This is useful in case that OpenMP isn't supported, see e.g. https://github.com/kliem/sage/pull/40/checks?check_run_id=2076988665).

With this ticket we can just run

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: #distutils: extra_compile_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: #distutils: extra_link_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: from cython.parallel import prange 
....:  
....: cdef int i 
....: cdef int n = 30 
....: cdef int sum = 0 
....:  
....: for i in prange(n, num_threads=4, nogil=True): 
....:     sum += i 
....:      
....: print(sum) 
....: ''')
```
regardless of whether the current system actually supports OpenMP.

Depends on #31384

I guess that proof things in case things change in the future (most likely several years).

It would be better to set the new variables in `sage_conf.py.in`, not `sage-env-config.in`, because they are not used as environment variables. See comments at the top of these files.

And I think you can get rid of `SAGE_HAVE_OPENMP` completely - in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` just check whether the flags are nonempty.
