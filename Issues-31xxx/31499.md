We define cython aliases `OPENMP_CFLAGS` and `OPENMP_CXXFLAGS`.

They must be used as `extra_link_args` and `extra_compile_args` to get `cython.parallel` to work in parallel.

If they are empty, `cython.parallel.prange` will still compile and work (but not in parallel). This is useful in case that OpenMP isn't supported, see e.g. https://github.com/kliem/sage/pull/40/checks?check_run_id=2076988665).

With this ticket we can just run

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: #distutils: extra_compile_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: #distutils: extra_link_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: from cython.parallel import prange 
....:  
....: cdef int i 
....: cdef int n = 30 
....: cdef int sum = 0 
....:  
....: for i in prange(n, num_threads=4, nogil=True): 
....:     sum += i 
....:      
....: print(sum) 
....: ''')
```
regardless of whether the current system actually supports OpenMP.

Exactly. In #27122 I didn't consider this and then we had to solve #30725. This was the solution we came up with (just reject OpenMP alltogether, if we cannot find consistent arguments to make it work.)

We don't try as hard as we could (if sage uses gcc, but for cython clang, it still might be possible to enable OpenMP for cython with different arguments). But this solution here should enable OpenMP in cython on many platforms and still work on the others.

Argh!!! I was going to answer that - hours ago - but I got interrupted by my day work (which is currently horrible, 2021 so far is worse for me than the whole of 2020).

As you can see there is only a single switch in each case which tells the compiler what headers and macro to enable at compile time and what library to use at link time.

I guess that proof things in case things change in the future (most likely several years).

It would be better to set the new variables in `sage_conf.py.in`, not `sage-env-config.in`, because they are not used as environment variables. See comments at the top of these files.

And I think you can get rid of `SAGE_HAVE_OPENMP` completely - in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` just check whether the flags are nonempty.
