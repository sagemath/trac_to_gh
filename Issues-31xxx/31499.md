We define cython aliases `OPENMP_CFLAGS` and `OPENMP_CXXFLAGS`.

They must be used as `extra_link_args` and `extra_compile_args` to get `cython.parallel` to work in parallel.

If they are empty, `cython.parallel.prange` will still compile and work (but not in parallel). This is useful in case that OpenMP isn't supported, see e.g. https://github.com/kliem/sage/pull/40/checks?check_run_id=2076988665).

With this ticket we can just run

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: #distutils: extra_compile_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: #distutils: extra_link_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: from cython.parallel import prange 
....:  
....: cdef int i 
....: cdef int n = 30 
....: cdef int sum = 0 
....:  
....: for i in prange(n, num_threads=4, nogil=True): 
....:     sum += i 
....:      
....: print(sum) 
....: ''')
```
regardless of whether the current system actually supports OpenMP.

macOS might be a bit more complicated. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66040039/openmp-support-for-mac-using-clang-or-gcc

I'm happy to add whatever to the list to make it work. Maybe `-Xclang -fopenmp` will work for you?
