( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```
We should also disregard when being passed no subdivisions:

```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)
sage: A._subdivisions
sage: A.subdivide(A.subdivisions())
sage: A._subdivisions
( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```

Thank you for solving this so quickly. This looks good to me – I just have a very small suggestion:

```diff
-        if row_lines == [] and col_lines == []:
+        if not row_lines and not col_lines:
```
