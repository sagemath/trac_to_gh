`pari_jupyter` is not compatible with Python 3.9,
breaks Docker build on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab).

Reported upstream at https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter/issues/9

Given that, we simplify our `Dockerfile` to skip
three optional packages it used to install:
`gap_jupyter`, `pari_jupyter`, `singular_jupyter`.

Some pointers as we stop shipping the GAP, PARI
and Singular Jupyter kernels in our Docker image.

The repo for the GAP Jupyter kernel is at:

- https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel

To try GAP with Jupyter online, see:

- https://github.com/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter

The repo for the PARI Jupyter kernel is at:

- - https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter

Solving the issue that broke things here is tracked at:

- https://github.com/jdemeyer/pari_jupyter/issues/9

See also "Run PARI/GP in your browser" including WebAssembly version:

- http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/gp.html

The repo for the Singular Jupyter kernel is at:

- https://github.com/sebasguts/jupyter_kernel_singular

See also the documentation page:
