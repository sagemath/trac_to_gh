We generalize `an_affine_basis`, `affine_hull`, `affine_hull_projection`, and `AffineHullProjectionData` (from #27366) from `Polyhedron_base` to `ConvexSet_base`.

To provide the default implementation of `affine_hull_projection`, this ticket also adds the `Polyhedron_base` methods `linear_transformation` and `translation` to the `ConvexSet_base` ABC, as well as `dilation` for completeness.
