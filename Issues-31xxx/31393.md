The file `src/sage/symbolic/todo.txt` is removed by #30482. Here are the only tasks that remain to be completed:

* genuine coercions to real field, etc.
* optimize is_even in numeric.cpp
* Support pickle via the "archive" print mode.
* need to be able to do this (from ginsh):
  {{{
  > collect_common_factors(x/(x^2 + x));
  (1+x)^(-1)
  }}}
* Maybe change Sage's GiNaC to make a call to a Cython gcd function, then use Singular, since Singular's gcd over QQ is much better than GiNaC's, I think, and GiNaC *only* does GCD over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in normal.cpp be implemented via Singular, probably...

Probably some of these can be deleted as invalid, but some may need tickets.
