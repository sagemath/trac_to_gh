I was trying the integral in #11590 with fricas, and it did not work. The existing conversion of the symbolic sign function is "sign", which cannot handle symbolic arguments.

But then apparently, Fricas cannot integrate functions containing abs.

Here is a trival test, do you want to add it?

```
sage: fricas(sign(x)).eval(x=-3)
- 1
```

Other than that, it looks good.  There is currently a giac failure, which I cannot say anything about.
