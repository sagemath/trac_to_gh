Some **polynomial-type operations** should be made available **matrix-wise**:
* `monic` (make each row-wise/column-wise leading polynomial monic)
* `truncation` (and more generally, mod by a polynomial? careful: mod method exists for this type of objects)
* `shift` (multiplication by power of variable)
* `reverse` (same polynomial with coefficients reversed; here w.r.t to matrix degree but also finer prescribed column-wise or row-wise bounds)

To be decided whether this should be added:
* get constant coefficient or coefficient of specified degree
* test `is_constant`

All the listed enhancements have been realized, along with tests and documentation. The methods support uniform actions, and also row-wise or column-wise ones where applicable (i.e. all methods except `constant_matrix` and `is_constant`).

Regarding naming:
* `constant_matrix` seems to be preferred over things like `constant_term` or `constant_coefficient`, since `coefficients` and `terms` are already existing methods relating to other notions
* I am ready to discuss the name for `matrix_coefficient_of_degree`, which I find too verbose.

Thank you for the two suggestions: I followed them for the additional `entry_wise` parameter, and for the `coefficient_matrix` name (less verbose, and also less confusing than things which would be too close to the `coefficients` and `terms` methods).

I also simplified the code a bit, since there was harmless but unnecessary lines supposed to handle matrices having zero rows or zero columns (or both).
