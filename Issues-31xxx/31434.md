Reported to Paul Zimmermann by his colleague Pierrick Gaudry.

In [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.0 (but also 9.2) this takes ages:

```
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: Fp6 = GF(p^6)
```
After two minutes, it did not finish...

By contrast, if a generator name is specified,
the field is created almost instantly:

```
sage: Fp6 = GF(p^6, 'a')
```

This goes back to #17569 where specifying
a generator name was made optional, and where
the default, when no generator name is given,
was set to using a pseudo-Conway modulus.

**CC:**  @slel

**Keywords:** speed

If no variable name is provided, Sage tries to compute
a pseudo-Conway polynomial to use as the modulus.

The [finite field constructor documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_constructor.html) warns:

> Note that the computation of pseudo-Conway polynomials
> is expensive when the degree is large and highly composite.
> If a variable name is specified then a random polynomial
> is used instead, which will be much faster to find.


To use a random irreducible polynomial as the modulus,
specify a variable name.

```
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: timeit("F = GF(p^6, 'a')")
5 loops, best of 3: 35.6 ms per loop
```

I think this is from #17569 (Allow creating
finite fields without a variable name).

I would tend to agree that a faster default
would better serve the casual user.

Let advanced users add keyword arguments
for specific time-consuming behaviours.

I think a change for very large primes is wise, but I think it's convenient that the following works, which would fail if we made the change suggested here:

```
sage: k = GF(4)
sage: l = GF(8)
sage: x = k.gen() + l.gen(); x
z6^5 + z6^4 + z6^3 + z6 + 1
sage: x.parent()
Finite Field in z6 of size 2^6
```

Here are some alternative suggestions to just always using random polynomials

* Use a cutoff depending on p: current behavior below the cutoff and random polynomial above the cutoff
* Print a warning (with an explanation of how to get different behavior) whenever an expensive computation is going to start

I think I would go with a slightly smaller threshold, since I want it to depend only on p and not on the degree.

```
sage: p = previous_prime(2^16-456)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
sage: %time K = GF(p^6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
CPU times: user 14.1 ms, sys: 891 µs, total: 15 ms
Wall time: 14.2 ms
sage: p = previous_prime(2^32-34567)                                                                                                                                                                                                               
sage: %time K = GF(p^6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
CPU times: user 43.1 ms, sys: 12.7 ms, total: 55.8 ms
Wall time: 55.7 ms
```

Note that the time increases for highly composite degree

```
sage: p = previous_prime(2^16-456)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
sage: %time K = GF(p^24)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
CPU times: user 214 ms, sys: 27.5 ms, total: 241 ms
Wall time: 252 ms
```
And sometimes you just hit integers that are hard to factor

```
sage: factor(p^23 - 1)
...
```

I have some sympathy with John Cremona's objection that depending the presence or absence of a generator name is strange.  I think there's just value in having both mechanisms be easy to construct, and having natural coercions available.

The main blocking step turns out to be factoring `p^n - 1`.
Luckily #31686 helps a lot:

```python
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: %time F = GF(p^6, 'a')
CPU times: user 93.6 ms, sys: 1.8 ms, total: 95.4 ms
Wall time: 174 ms
sage: %time F = GF(p^6)
CPU times: user 1.48 s, sys: 7.48 ms, total: 1.49 s
Wall time: 1.91 s
