Reported to Paul Zimmermann by his colleague Pierrick Gaudry.

In [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.0 (but also 9.2) this takes ages:

```
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: Fp6 = GF(p^6)
```
After two minutes, it did not finish...

By contrast, if a generator name is specified,
the field is created almost instantly:

```
sage: Fp6 = GF(p^6, 'a')
```

This goes back to #17569 where specifying
a generator name was made optional, and where
the default, when no generator name is given,
was set to using a pseudo-Conway modulus.

Depends on #31686

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

If no variable name is provided, Sage tries to compute
a pseudo-Conway polynomial to use as the modulus.

The [finite field constructor documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_constructor.html) warns:

> Note that the computation of pseudo-Conway polynomials
> is expensive when the degree is large and highly composite.
> If a variable name is specified then a random polynomial
> is used instead, which will be much faster to find.

To use a random irreducible polynomial as the modulus,
specify a variable name.

```
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: timeit("F = GF(p^6, 'a')")
5 loops, best of 3: 35.6 ms per loop
```

I think this is from #17569 (Allow creating
finite fields without a variable name).

I would tend to agree that a faster default
would better serve the casual user.

Let advanced users add keyword arguments
for specific time-consuming behaviours.

I think a change for very large primes is wise, but I think it's convenient that the following works, which would fail if we made the change suggested here:

```
sage: k = GF(4)
sage: l = GF(8)
sage: x = k.gen() + l.gen(); x
z6^5 + z6^4 + z6^3 + z6 + 1
sage: x.parent()
Finite Field in z6 of size 2^6
```

Here are some alternative suggestions to just always using random polynomials

* Use a cutoff depending on p: current behavior below the cutoff and random polynomial above the cutoff
* Print a warning (with an explanation of how to get different behavior) whenever an expensive computation is going to start

I think I would go with a slightly smaller threshold, since I want it to depend only on p and not on the degree.

```

And sometimes you just hit integers that are hard to factor

```

Luckily #31686 helps a lot:
