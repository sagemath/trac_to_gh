In an editable install of sagelib (#31377), the `tdlib` subdirectory is considered as a namespace package directory, shadowing the `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` module, causing the failures reported on that ticket.

We fix this by moving the file `tdlib/sage_tdlib.cpp` (the only file in that subdirectory) one level higher.
