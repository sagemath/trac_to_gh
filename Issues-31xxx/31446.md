The GAP package [GBNP](https://gap-packages.github.io/gbnp/), according to its documentation, "provides algorithms for computing Gröbner bases of noncommutative polynomials with coefficients from a field implemented in GAP and with respect to the “total degree first then lexicographical” ordering".

GBNP can be wrapped for Sage by including and adapting [this project](https://gitlab.com/mathzeta2/gbnp). The current implementation in Sage for noncommutative Gröbner bases wraps `letterplace` (from Singular) is restricted to weighted homogeneous elements, and it seem to be somewhat less efficient than GBNP. In any case, it is a good idea to have more than one engine for such tasks.

Note that GAP supports function fields (including with more than one variable), but the `libgap` interface does not.

It does seem to be included in the `gap_packages` optional package (from looking at the spkg installation file). So you probably just need to mark the doctests as `# optional - gap_packages` and tell the user to install that.\n\nIt seems that gap_packages includes GBNP v1.0.3 released 2016-03-08, per their [changelog](https://github.com/gap-packages/gbnp/blob/master/Changelog), and the \"manual install\" here suggests v1.0.5 released 2022-03-09. There are no doctest errors using v1.0.3, but it might be a good idea to update gap_packages in a new ticket.\n\nIf I have to guess why the manual install instructions are there, then it has to do with the initial development of this wrapper, which was done using a binary Sage or on Windows (or both). So it was impossible to use gap_packages which requires a compiler, IIRC. The manual install with extracting one tarball is possible in such case, that relied on [this obsolete Wiki page](https://wiki.sagemath.org/InstallingGapPackages?action=recall&rev=8). This is still a convenient way to install GAP packages that do not require any compiler.\n\nDo we have anywhere in the Sage docs an explanation how to install optional GAP packages (not the one for [gap_packages](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/gap_packages.html)), or links to the [GAP docs](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap76.html#X79F76C1E834BFDCC)? It is a question that come up in ask.sagemath.org from time to time.

Thanks.
> However, the manual building and installing of the package is not allowed I believe. It does seem to be included in the `gap_packages` optional package (from looking at the spkg installation file). So you probably just need to mark the doctests as `# optional - gap_packages` and tell the user to install that.

It seems that gap_packages includes GBNP v1.0.3 released 2016-03-08, per their [changelog](https://github.com/gap-packages/gbnp/blob/master/Changelog), and the "manual install" here suggests v1.0.5 released 2022-03-09. There are no doctest errors using v1.0.3, but it might be a good idea to update gap_packages in a new ticket.

If I have to guess why the manual install instructions are there, then it has to do with the initial development of this wrapper, which was done using a binary Sage or on Windows (or both). So it was impossible to use gap_packages which requires a compiler, IIRC. The manual install with extracting one tarball is possible in such case, that relied on [this obsolete Wiki page](https://wiki.sagemath.org/InstallingGapPackages?action=recall&rev=8). This is still a convenient way to install GAP packages that do not require any compiler.

Do we have anywhere in the Sage docs an explanation how to install optional GAP packages (not the one for [gap_packages](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/gap_packages.html)), or links to the [GAP docs](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap76.html#X79F76C1E834BFDCC)? It is a question that come up in ask.sagemath.org from time to time. For this ticket, I suppose using `# optional - gap_packages` is a solution while telling the user the recommended way is to install gap_packages, but still leave the manual instructions. Does this sound right?

+1 This usually happens with new GAP versions, but it doesn't have to happen in sync.

The first thing we (or at least I) usually tell people is to install `gap_packages`, which has become easier for non-developers IIRC.

I am a very strong -1 on including the "manual" instructions here in anything associated with this ticket. I do not want anything to hint at anything that looks "very official" that hasn't been rigorously tested by the build team.

These instructions can go on some Sage wiki page or something like that, but as a general instruction (of course, with an appropriate warning).

Grepping for `sage -i` returns different places in the docs where an optional package is needed. It makes it easier for users to have this information on the same page.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Fair enough. I do agree that it is useful to tell the user directly what to do to get the file to work for "most" users. Although having a more standard page with more robust instructions would be better. That doesn't need to be done here though.

Next I am going to get into the main code comments:

I think this should fit together better with the free algebra implementations that are currently in Sage. I see two obvious ways to do this:

1. Have this be a new implementation via the `implementation` keyword to `FreeAlgebra`.
2. Add a `gap()` (and similar) method that returns (and stores) the gap object corresponding to the `FreeAlgebra_generic` implementation and other objects. Then you only need to add a `algorithm="gap"` argument for the `groebner_basis()` method (which would be the default and only one currently accepted).

I would do option (2) as it means better exposure and it means we don't have yet-another-implementation. Plus, you are already almost there anyways with subclassing. It's a bit more work, but it will make for a much nicer result IMO. You won't have to mark so many tests as optional either.

I disagree with the `letterplace` implementation that returns another ideal rather than a tuple-like object for the GB. This is very different than polynomial rings:

```
sage: S.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
sage: S.ideal([a*b, b*c-a])
Ideal (a*b, b*c - a) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c over Rational Field
sage: _.groebner_basis()
[a^2, a*b, b*c - a]
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence.PolynomialSequence_generic'>
```
Hence, I think your GB method should return a tuple.

Your interface file is not (just) an interface, it contains an implementation within Sage using the interface. Although if you go with option (2) above, the only things that would really survive would be the `_x2y` functions (which gives the interface). Interface files typically go in the `interfaces` folder. If you go with (1) above, then I think you should separate the implementation into a separate file (which could be in the `free_algebra.py` file) too.

The function names `_x2y` are either not descriptive enough or the documentation is not reflecting their generality. I would rename them something like `x2y_free_algebra_element`. For an interface file, I think it is important that they are publicly visible.

Not necessary, but it would be nice to have something that checks containment of ideals by reducing the generators of one to the other.

Minor point, but I would like this reverted:

```diff
-   :maxdepth: 2
+   :maxdepth: 1
```
as I like the current version.

I agree that it is better to have an API consistency for methods called `groebner_basis` in Sage, including the commutative case. For the bigger code changes suggested above, it means diving further into the `FreeAlgebra` implementation, which I do not have the time currently. Few points to consider: Making sure only the deglex term order is implemented.

It is strange thing for the quotient ring.\n- Same for `reduce`, which is something for the ideal, not the quotient ring (where everything is already reduced).\n- For regular polynomial rings, `hilbert_series()` is a method of the ideal.\n- `if type(rels) == GapIdeal:` is better as `if isinstance(rels, GapIdeal):`.",

I = super(FreeAlgebra_generic, self).ideal(*gens, **kwds)
return GapIdeal(self, I.gens())
```

> Few points to consider: Making sure only the deglex term order is implemented. In `_sage2gap` the monoid generators of a free algebra `F` (i.e. `F.monoid().gens()`) work, but `F.gens()` do not work with it. I see that they are objects of different classes, and I just used the first thing that worked.


I don't really understand this comment. Of course `_sage2gap` only works with one of them, they are completely different classes (even though they have the same string representation).

> One implementation goal of GBNP is being able to store partial computations, as they might not even terminate, and resume later. All of this should be considered when refactoring.


It doesn't do that; the onus is on the user to hold onto a reference to output and then build on that. Returning a tuple just means the user has to do one more step of `Ip = R.ideal(I.groebner_basis())` instead of `Ip = I.groebner_basis()`. I should also stated that a GB is not an ideal, so I would be somewhat surprised by the output being an ideal.

Some other comments:

- Rename `get_basis()` to `basis()`, which should return a `Family`. We should have different behaviors for known finite dimensional, which should just return everything. For the infinite case, it is too bad `BaseQA` does not iterate through the basis elements. So I think we can do a little helper class to generate things as needed:
  {{{#!python
class LazyBasis(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
    def __init__(self, Q):
        self.Q = Q
        self.ngens = Q.cover_ring().ngens()
        self.basis = []
        Parent.__init__(self, EnumeratedSets().Infinite(), facade=True)
    def __getitem__(self, n):
        if n < 0:
            raise IndexError("infinite list")
        if n < len(self.basis):
            return self.basis[n]
        Q = self.Q
        self.basis = libgap.BaseQA(Q._gap_rels, self.ngens, n)
        return self.basis[n]
    def __iter__(self):
        n = 0
        while True:
            yield self[n]
            n += 1
  }}}
  So then we would have
  {{{#!python
def basis(self):
    R = self.cover_ring()
    def convert(x):
        return _gap2sage(x, R)
    if self.is_finite_dimensional():
        res = libgap.BaseQA(Q._gap_rels, self.ngens, n)
        return Family([covert(x) for x in res])
    return Family(convert, LazyBasis(self))
  }}}
- Rename `get_matrices()` to `get_structure_coefficients()`, which should also should have a `basis=None` default that uses the full basis when it is finite dimensional.
- I don't understand why the `get_leading_monomials` method is there. It is strange thing for the quotient ring.
- Same for `reduce`, which is something for the ideal, not the quotient ring (where everything is already reduced).
- For regular polynomial rings, `hilbert_series()` is a method of the ideal.
- `if type(rels) == GapIdeal:` is better as `if isinstance(rels, GapIdeal):`.
