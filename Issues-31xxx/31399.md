This seems like an extension of the `change_ring` functionality. We can achieve the same result with `change_ring` as follows:

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[] 
sage: I = R.ideal(t + 1)
sage: k = ResidueField(I)
sage: F.<t> = FractionField(R)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(F, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 + t*y^2, y^2])
sage: f.change_ring(k).change_ring(GF(5))
```

Is there a specific use case where `change_ring` isn't sufficient?
