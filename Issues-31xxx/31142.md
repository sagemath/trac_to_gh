In this ticket, using the new tools described in  https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#For_developers:_Setting_up_Python_packages_from_PyPI_as_Sage_packages (using the modifications from #29655), we add the missing files (and make some minor other adjustments) for all of the above packages except `sagelib`.
