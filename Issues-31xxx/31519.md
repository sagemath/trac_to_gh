As discussed in the earlier ticket #20387 about the finite ring,
we must show that `R` has an identity and that
every non-zero element of `R` is a unit.

Let's make it more clear with the help of an example:
Suppose that `R` has `n` elements. 
Let `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, ..., `an` be the distinct elements of `R`.
Let `a` in `R`, `a = 0`.
Now, `a ai` belongs top all `I`, so
`{a a1, a a2, ..., a an}` is a subset of `R`.

If `a ai = a aj`, then `ai = aj`.
Therefore, the elements `a a1`, `a a2`, ..., `a an` must be distinct.

We know that R has only n elements, it follows that
`R = {aa1, aa2., ...,aan}`.
This implies that `a` belongs to `{a a1, a a2, ..., a an}`.
So from this we conclude that one of the products
must be equal to `a`.

Let `a ai = a`.

Since `R` is commutative, we also have `a1 a = a`.

We show that `ai` is the identity of `R`.
Let `b` be any element of `R`.

Then `b` belongs to `{a a1, a a2, ..., a an}`.

So there exists `aj` in `R` such that b = aaj
Thus,

```
b ai = ai b   (since R is commutative)
     = ai (a ai)  (substitution for b)
     = (ai a) aj
     = a aj
     = b
```

Therefore `ai` is the identity of `R`
and we denote the identity of `R` by `I`.

`I` belongs to `R = {a a1, a a2, ..., a an}`.
from this one of the products lets `a ak = 1`.
Using the commutative property, `ak a = a ak = 1`.
So we conclude that every non-zero element
is a unit and hence `R` is a field.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

This ticket is based on a misunderstanding of #20387, and should therefore be closed as invalid.

It is unfortunately not true that every finite ring is a field. (For example, if `n` is not prime, then the ring `Z_n` of integers modulo `n` is not a field.) The problem with the proof in the ticket description is that it assumes the cancellation law ("If `a ai = a aj`, then `ai = aj`"), but this is not true if the ring is not an integral domain.

A solution to #20387 would add an error message when one of the functions mentioned there is called with a finite ring that is not a field.
