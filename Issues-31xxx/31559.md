In the constructor I would either allow a list of modular forms or a dictionary. In both situations there should be a check that the data is consistent. And in the case it is a dictionary, you would better not write

```
    self.__mf_dict = mf_dict
```
because this uses the dictionary provided in the input. This dictionary can be modified outside of the scope of the class and corrupt the data in a scenario such as

```
sage: d = {}
sage: f = M(d)
sage: d[3] = 'hello'  # data corruption
```

Why do you have a method `_dictionary` and not use directly `__mf_dict`. This add one level of indirection for no purpose that I can see.

When you iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary it is best to use the `items()` method as in

```
def __neg__(self):
    GM = self.__class__
    minus_self = {k:-v for k,v in self.__mf_dict.items()}
    return GM(self.parent(), minus_self)
```

You should always take care of removing the entries in the dictionary whose values are zero (in the constructor and after a binary operation). Otherwise a method such as `is_homogeneous` gets completely wrong.

Use `__neg__` and not `_neg_` (this method does not go through corecion).

In `__getitem__` you would better return the zero of the base ring and not the python integer `0`.

Don't write `x.__getitem__(k)` but `x[k]`. The latter is much faster in general.

Rather than

```
def weights(self):
    wts = list(self._dictionnary().keys())
    wts.sort()
    return wts
```
you could use

```
def weights(self):
    return sorted(self.__mf_dict)
```

Instead of

```
def is_homogeneous(self):
    if len(self._dictionnary())>1:
        return False
    return True
```
you could use

```
def is_homogeneous(self):
    return len(self.__mf_dict) <= 1
```

For the documentation, it is `INPUT` and not `INPUTS`. And the items afterwards should not be indented.

It would be better to inherit from `ModuleElement` (not doing this causes trouble with the coercion model). Once done, implement the method `_lmul_` for scalar multiplications (it should be possible to do `integer x (element of the ring of modular forms)`.

Another method that is lacking is `__bool__` (for the zero test). Once the dictionary is clean (ie no zero value) you could simply do

```
def __bool__(self):
    return bool(self.__mf_dict)
```
Also write methods `is_zero` and `is_one` that are standard ones for rings.

If `qexp` is simply an alias of `q_expansion` write `qexp = q_expansion`. The documentation of `q_expansion` could mention the fact that such an alias exists.

The method `_repr_` could be simplified to

```
def _repr_(self):
    return str(self.q_expansion())
```

Since now `ModularFormsRing` inherit from `Parent` you could use the test suite. You should add the following test in the constructor `ModularFormsRing.__init__`

```
TESTS::

    sage: M = ModularFormsRing(1)
    sage: TestSuite(M).run()
```
This test suite should also be run with other groups (~~especially non-congruence once~~) and other base rings.

The coercion is not tested, right? You should add various tests for

```
(modular form) + (element of ModularFormsRing)
(element of ModularFormsRing) + (modular form)
(scalar) + (element of ModularFormsRing)
(element of ModularFormsRing) + (scalar)
```

To determine coercions, one alternative could be to rely on what is implemented for modular forms. Namely the `ModularFormsRing` should have a method to obtain the modular forms of a given weight (something like `M.graded_component(self, weight)`. It would then be possible to use coercions with respect to whatever is the result of this method.

Looks good. Could you set to ~~positive review~~ **needs review** so that we can also have an opinion from patchbots?

`is_zero` would better be implemented as `return not self`.

Rather than `self[0] == 1` I would rather use `self._forms_dictionary[0].is_one()` which has less indirections.

Your `__getitem__` is too laxist. You could access `F['a']` or `F[(1,2,3)]`.

I am not sure we want to support rich comparison involving anything else than `==` or `!=`. What would be the meaning of `F < G`?

(just a remark) Technically speaking, it is conceivable to do binary operations on modular forms with different groups. It is a well defined modular forms for the intersection of the two groups (which is still finite index).

Your one element looks wrong. The dictionary should be `{0: self.base_ring().one()}`.

After searching a bit in the code, I think that I found the origin of this error. It comes from the method `__mul__` of the class `ModularFormElement` (in `sage/modular/modform/element.py`). Here's the description of the method:

```
def __mul__(self, other):
        r"""
        Calculate the product self * other.

        This tries to determine the
        characters of self and other, in order to avoid having to compute a
        (potentially very large) Gamma1 space. Note that this might lead to
        a modular form that is defined with respect to a larger subgroup than
        the factors are.
```

This is illustrated by this example:

```
sage: f = ModularForms(Gamma1(3), 5).0
sage: f*f
1 - 180*q^2 - 480*q^3 + 8100*q^4 + 35712*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: (f*f).parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 4 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(3) of weight 10 over Rational Field
```

This poses a problem as it is not always possible to add two forms with different groups:

```
sage: M1 = ModularForms(Gamma1(8), 8); M1
Modular Forms space of dimension 17 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(8) of weight 8 over Rational Field
sage: M0 = ModularForms(Gamma0(8), 8); M0
Modular Forms space of dimension 9 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(8) of weight 8 over Rational Field
sage: f = M1.0
sage: g = M0.0
sage: f+g
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Modular Forms space of dimension 17 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(8) of weight 8 over Rational Field' and 'Modular Forms space of dimension 9 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(8) of weight 8 over Rational Field'
```

Since the code of this ticket relies a lot on operations like these, one "easy fix" I can think of right now is to simply do not allow the creation of `GradedModularFormElement` for the congruence subgroups Gamma1(N) (by returning a `NotImplementedError`). Another fix (other ticket) would be to define some coercions between the two spaces so that it is possible to add two forms with compatible groups.

The reason why it does not work in your example is because the form `f * f` is of weight 10 while the space `M` is of weight 5. I think that you meant to write this:

```
sage: f = ModularForms(Gamma1(3), 5).0
sage: M1 = ModularForms(Gamma1(3), 10)
sage: F2 = M1(f * f); F2   # this works!
1 - 180*q^2 - 480*q^3 + 8100*q^4 + 35712*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: F2.parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 4 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(3) of weight 10 over Rational Field
``` 

**EDIT: ** the above example only works if the two spaces have the same dimension:

```
sage: M0 = ModularForms(Gamma0(8), 10); M0
Modular Forms space of dimension 11 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(8) of weight 10 over Rational Field
sage: M1 = ModularForms(Gamma1(8), 10); M1
Modular Forms space of dimension 21 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(8) of weight 10 over Rational Field
sage: f = M0.0
sage: M1(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: entries must be a list of length 21
```

However, it is possible to convert it to a form over Gamma1 by using q-expansion with enough precision:

```
sage: fq = f.qexp(42)
sage: M1(fq)
q + O(q^6)
```

- In the same docstring the dictionary is quoted but not the list.

- The class deserves a documentation. In particular the line `An element of a graded ring of modular forms.` should move from `__init__` to the main docstring (just below the class name).

- Currently there is no error if you ask for negative degrees : `f[-1]` returns `0`

- There is a remaining TODO written as a comment in the file ` #TODO: fix the error E4 + QQ(0)`. Could you either expand it or remove it?

- Is `_rmul_` really necessary? The left and right actions of scalars are the same.

- This is a bug

  ```
  sage: M.zero().weight()
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  StopIteration: 
```

- there is a trailing whitespace in the documentation of `ModularFormSpace._pushout_`

What about renaming `find_generators.py` in `ring.py`. It would make more sense to me. If you like it, the file `find_generators.py` must remain with proper deprecation warnings.

```
sage: QQ['x']

For example `Ring of Modular Forms for %s over %s`.

I moved the file `find_generators.py` in the last commit (1b9332e). I also tried to implement the deprecation framework following this guide: 

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation.

However, I don't think it was a success because there is now one doctest that does not pass when I run the following command:

```
./sage -t src/sage/modular/modform/find_generators.py
```

```
File "src/sage/rings/find_generators.py", line 189, in sage.rings.find_generators.ModularFormsRing.__init__
Failed example:
    ModularFormsRing(Gamma1(13))
Expected:
    Ring of Modular Forms for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(13) over Rational Field
Got:
    doctest:warning
    ...
    DeprecationWarning:
    Importing ModularFormsRing from here is deprecated. If you need to use it, please import it directly from sage.rings.find_generators
    See https://trac.sagemath.org/31559 for details.

What confuses me is that if I run the following command:

```
sage -t src/sage/rings/find_generators.py
```

I get the same error. Does this means that `ModularFormsRing` is imported from the old module?

The documentation of a class goes in the main docstring not in the `__init__` docstring. That is

```
class A(object):
    r"""
    This is my class A

    EXAMPLES:

    This is useful as it is the first letter of the alphabet::

        sage: a = A()
    """
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        r"""
        INPUT:
        
        - ``a`` - an a

        - ``b`` - a b
        """

Ok, I'll move the deprecation tests inside `find_generators`. It does make more sense. Considering the "same doctest", in the first one I am testing the deprecated function name (as you suggested in comment 49) and in the second one I am testing the deprecation import warning:

            DeprecationWarning: find_generators is deprecated. Please use sage.modular.modform.ring.generators instead.
            See https://trac.sagemath.org/31559 for details.

        ::

            sage: from sage.modular.modform.FIND_GENERATORS import find_generators
            sage: find_generators(ModularFormsRing(1))

Considering the placement of the documentation of the class, I did it like this because that's how it was done before I started working on this ticket, but I will change it, thank you for pointing it out!
