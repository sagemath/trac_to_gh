I pushed a small branch which slightly simplifies the method primitive_length of FiniteWord_class.

Explanation: We have that a word is primitive if and only if its period is not a proper divisor of its length (see for example Problem 1.2.1 in [Lothaire2002]). Clearly, if its period is a divisor of its length, then the length of the primitive root is equal to the period.
