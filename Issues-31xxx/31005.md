The docbuild was failing for me, and it was hard to track down where the original error occurred because there was no (proper) traceback information. In this ticket, such a traceback information is added for exceptions in the docbuild worker following the approach taken in https://bugs.python.org/issue13831.

Example output:

```
sage_setup.docbuild.utils.RemoteException: 
"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/sage_setup/docbuild/utils.py", line 179, in run_worker
    result = target(task)
  File "/mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/a_test_docbuild_exc.py", line 7, in target
    1 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
"""

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/a_test_docbuild_exc.py", line 12, in <module>
    build_many(target, range(8), processes=8)
  File "/mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/sage_setup/docbuild/utils.py", line 336, in build_many
    raise worker_exc.original_exception
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
for the test file

```
from sage_setup.docbuild.utils import build_many

def target(N):
    import time, os, signal
    if N == 1:
        # Task 4 is a poison pill
        1 / 0
    else:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print('Processed task %s' % N)

build_many(target, range(8), processes=8)
```

I've been having problems building the documentation on OS X Big Sur with the latest Xcode + homebrew. This ticket didn't have any apparent effect on the traceback.

Hm, this is even better. But now another refactoring is suggesting itself. Instead of,

```python
def __reduce__(self):
    def _rebuild_exc(exc: BaseException, tb: str):
        """
        Reconstructs the exception, putting the original exception as cause.
        """
        exc.__cause__ = RemoteException(tb)
        return exc

    return _rebuild_exc, (self.exc, self.tb)
```

couldn't we just do

```python
def __reduce__(self):
    self.exc.__cause__ =  RemoteException(self.tb)
    return self.exc
```

?

I also think we'll need doctests for the new classes/methods even if they're pretty trivial. Otherwise our coverage goes down.

I don't have much experience with pickling, but https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__reduce__ says that either a string or tuple should be returned.

My solution also didn't worked as `__reduce__` cannot return locally defined methods. So I've converted it to a static instance method as you initially suggested.

I've added a doctest for the reduce method. The other methods are still covered by the existing doctests.

I know, I was referring specifically to (before):

```
$ sage -coverage src/sage_docbuild/utils.py 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage_docbuild/utils.py: 50.0% (1 of 2)

Missing documentation:
     * line 10: def __init__(self, message, original_exception=None)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

and (after):

```
$ sage -coverage src/sage_docbuild/utils.py 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage_docbuild/utils.py: 28.6% (2 of 7)

Missing documentation:
     * line 16: def __init__(self, tb:str)
     * line 19: def __str__(self)
     * line 32: def __init__(self, exc:BaseException)
     * line 65: def __init__(self, message:Optional[str], original_exception:Optional[BaseException]=None)

Missing doctests:
     * line 42: def _rebuild_exc(exc:BaseException, tb:str)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Normally the patchbots would have complained (see the "coverage" plugin), but in this case I think the special nature of the sage_docbuild package avoided it.

I've been on the other side of this argument more than once, so I feel for you, but the developer's guide still states that every function needs a docstring: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings
