This ticket is related to #30346 which fixed a segmentation fault in the method `homfly_polynomial` applied to the trivial knot diagram. Here we treat similar cases for the methods `is_alternating`, `khovanov_homology` and `jones_polynomial`.

While the first two cases produce errors you get a wrong result in the third case (which is the result for two unknots that do not cross each other):

```
sage: Ua = Link([]); Ua
Link with 1 component represented by 0 crossings
sage: Ua.khovanov_homology()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

sage: Ua.is_alternating()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range

sage: Ua.jones_polynomial()
-sqrt(t) - 1/sqrt(t)
sage: Ub = Link(BraidGroup(2).gen(0))
sage: Ub.jones_polynomial()
1
```

Indeed, `algorithm='statesum'` returns the correct result:

```
sage: U=Link([])
sage: U.jones_polynomial(algorithm='statesum')
1
```


Explicitly the bug is in the method `braid`. I think the problem is a kind of dilemma: The correct result of the method `braid` for the trivial diagram would be `one` of the braid group on one strand. But since the braid group construction doesn't allow to define it the `one` of the braid group on two strands is returned the closure of which are two isolated unknots.

The clearest way to fix this would be to implement the trivial group as the braid group on one strand, but probably annoying to work this through all methods of the class.

Another possibility is to let the generator of the two strand braid group be the braid of the trivial diagram. But this disturbs the recursive structure of the method. So, I don't know what to do here!

But, shouldn't we add a note in the `braid` method pointing out that - on the one hand - the closure of the trivial diagram's braid is the union of two unknots (mathematically)  which - on the other hand - is consistent with the braid closure construction according to the note in the docstring of the class.

I mean for example this:\n\n\n```\nsage: K5_2 = Link([[1, 4, 2, 5], [3, 8, 4, 9], [5, 10, 6, 1], [7, 2, 8, 3], [9, 6, 10, 7]])\nsage: K5_2.is_alternating()\nTrue\nsage: K5_2b = Link(K5_2.braid())\nsage: K5_2b.is_alternating()\nFalse\n```\n\nOnce this is done, you may switch to positive review.",

You are right! But, shouldn't we add a note in the `braid` method pointing out that - on the one hand - the closure of the trivial diagram's braid is the union of two unknots (mathematically)  which - on the other hand - is consistent with the braid closure construction according to the note in the docstring of the class. Maybe the phrasing of the latter should take the unknot into account, as well.

Furthermore, in the note you add to `is_alternating` I think we should say that the result may return `False` even though isotopic alternating diagrams exist (to make clear that the term is used differently as in the Hoste-Thistlethwaite table). I mean for example this:


```
sage: K5_2 = Link([[1, 4, 2, 5], [3, 8, 4, 9], [5, 10, 6, 1], [7, 2, 8, 3], [9, 6, 10, 7]])
sage: K5_2.is_alternating()
True
sage: K5_2b = Link(K5_2.braid())
sage: K5_2b.is_alternating()
False
```

Once this is done, you may switch to positive review.
