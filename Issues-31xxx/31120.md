We move the default implementation of `_div_` which is using the product by the inverse from the categories of `Magmas` to the categories of `Monoids`.

The main reason is that the inverse of an element is not well-defined for a magma, where left-inverse and right-inverse must be distinguished.

This is a very small ticket in preparation for #17965

I still think that the small change made here goes in the positive direction.

If somebody at some point in the future really needs left and right division in magmas, then it will be possible to introduce say `_leftdiv_` and `_rightdiv_` default methods in the Element class of magmas. I am ready to bet that this will ***never*** happen.

Moreover, we do not even have a symbol for the division on the left, do we ?

`@`nthiery, any constructive comment ?

The only other thing I am a bit worried about is that this operation can still make sense in a magma when `x` has an (two-sided) inverse. I agree that we are not very likely to have an unital magma with some inverses (perhaps even a division magma) that is not a monoid.

We could use `_backslash_` as left division:

```
sage: 2 \ 5
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '_backslash_'
```
However, we currently have no protocol for this.

As said in the description, this very tiny ticket is meant to prepare for #17965, which aims at unifying the interface for inversion, a much needed task I would say.

Can we please move on ? I do not see the point of insisting on introducing left and right inverses in magmas, as there is currently no need for that anywhere, and there will probably never be.
