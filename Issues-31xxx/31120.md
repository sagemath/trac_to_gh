We move the default implementation of `_div_` which is using the product by the inverse from the categories of `Magmas` to the categories of `Monoids`.

The main reason is that the inverse of an element is not well-defined for a magma, where left-inverse and right-inverse must be distinguished.

This is a very small ticket in preparation for #17965

Ok, I guess this should / could be discussed on sage-devel.

Certainly having both left inverses and right inverses would be good. I am frightened to open such a can of worms.

In my opinion, everything about **units** and **inverses** should belong to the category of *monoid* and not to the category of *magma*. One could argue that one can define these for magmas, but my point is that these notions are really seriously useful only for monoids.

I still think that the small change made here goes in the positive direction.

If somebody at some point in the future really needs left and right division in magmas, then it will be possible to introduce say `_leftdiv_` and `_rightdiv_` default methods in the Element class of magmas. I am ready to bet that this will ***never*** happen.

Moreover, we do not even have a symbol for the division on the left, do we ?

@nthiery, any constructive comment ?

We could use `_backslash_` as left division:

```
sage: 2 \ 5
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '_backslash_'
```
However, we currently have no protocol for this.

As said in the description, this very tiny ticket is meant to prepare for #17965, which aims at unifying the interface for inversion, a much needed task I would say.

Can we please move on ? I do not see the point of insisting on introducing left and right inverses in magmas, as there is currently no need for that anywhere, and there will probably never be.

I regret that this ticket stands still. My opinion is unchanged that the proper locus for the notion of inverse is the theory of monoids, and that we will probably never need "inverses" for magmas.

Do you see any way out ? Should we ask somebody else, so that the discussion does not remain stuck between the two of us ? But who ?

The discussion was about moving `_div_` from magmas to monoids.

Staring at commit 7d85a76... does it completely remove magmas?
