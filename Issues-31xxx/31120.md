We move the default implementation of `_div_` which is using the product by the inverse from the categories of `Magmas` to the categories of `Monoids`.

The main reason is that the inverse of an element is not well-defined for a magma, where left-inverse and right-inverse must be distinguished.

This is a very small ticket in preparation for #17965

Ok, I guess this should / could be discussed on sage-devel.

Certainly having both left inverses and right inverses would be good. I am frightened to open such a can of worms.

In my opinion, everything about **units** and **inverses** should belong to the category of *monoid* and not to the category of *magma*. One could argue that one can define these for magmas, but my point is that these notions are really seriously useful only for monoids.

I certainly can understand being hesitant about it. Although I doubt it would be that bad as I don't think it is that common to have something with only 1-sided inverses or other esoteric behavior around this.

I still think that the small change made here goes in the positive direction.

If somebody at some point in the future really needs left and right division in magmas, then it will be possible to introduce say `_leftdiv_` and `_rightdiv_` default methods in the Element class of magmas. I am ready to bet that this will ***never*** happen.

Moreover, we do not even have a symbol for the division on the left, do we ?

@nthiery, any constructive comment ?

The only other thing I am a bit worried about is that this operation can still make sense in a magma when `x` has an (two-sided) inverse. I agree that we are not very likely to have an unital magma with some inverses (perhaps even a division magma) that is not a monoid.

We could use `_backslash_` as left division:

```
sage: 2 \ 5
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '_backslash_'
```
However, we currently have no protocol for this.
