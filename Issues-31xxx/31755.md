In Sage 9.1 or 9.3.rc4:

```
sage: from sage.rings.number_field.number_field_morphisms import (
....:         NumberFieldEmbedding)

sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2, embedding=1.414)
sage: x = polygen(K)
sage: p = x^3 + (sqrt2/2 + 1/3)*x^2 + (2*sqrt2/5+3/7)*x - 1
sage: L.<s> = K.extension(p)

sage: a = L.relative_polynomial().roots(QQbar)[0][0]
sage: a
0.5407496381556470?

sage: my_embedding = NumberFieldEmbedding(L, QQbar, a)
sage: my_embedding
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in s with defining polynomial
            x^3 + (1/2*sqrt2 + 1/3)*x^2 + (2/5*sqrt2 + 3/7)*x - 1
            over its base field
  To:   Algebraic Field
  Defn: s -> 0.5407496381556470?

sage: my_embedding.gen_image()
0.5407496381556470?
sage: my_embedding(L.gen())
0.01354690080260168?
sage: my_embedding(sqrt2)
-0.9806353488506175?
```

Expected:

- `my_embedding.gen_image()` should equal `my_embedding(L.gen())`
- the image of `sqrt2` should be the (positive) square root of 2

The issue seems to stem from Sage somehow confusing
the relative generator of `L` (over `K`) with the absolute
generator of `L` (over `QQ`).
