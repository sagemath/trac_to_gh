We should ensure flat shading is the default
when plotting 3d polyhedra with Three.js.

In this example, only the middle cube (at the origin)
has flat shading and looks correct:

```
sage: cc = [(0, 0, 0), (-1.125, 1.125, 0), (1.125, -1.125, 0)]
sage: cubes = sum(cube(c) for c in cc)
sage: cubes.show(frame=False)
```

The special case of Platonic solids (as purely graphics objects)
was done in #27836.

In this ticket we do the following:
* We fix a bug in `plot3d.platonic`:
  When translating such a platonic solid,
  the default behavior of flat shading is ignored
  as shown in the previous example.
  We fix that.

* We set flat shading to be the default behavior
  for plots of `geometry.polyhedron`.

I thought changing the `plot` method
in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py`
to set `threejs_flat_shading` to `True`
for the case of 3d polyhedra would do the trick.

I tried this change without success:

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I think there are two different things here:

* There is a bug in `plot3d.platonic`:
  As your example shows, when changing the center in one of these Platonic solids, the plot does not respect the default `threejs_flat_shading=True`.
  This is a bug which occurs in the function `prep`.
  To fix it, the assignment `threejs_flat_shading=True` should be set before applying the translation.


* For plots of `geometry.polyhedron`, one can set flat shading as follows:

 ```
 sage: P = polytopes.cube()
 sage: P.plot(polygon={"threejs_flat_shading": True})
  ```
  I will set this as the default behavior.
  However, I do not encourage putting `threejs_flat_shading` as a parameter of the function `plot`.
  style-related parameters of `plot` should be passed through the parameters `point`, `line` and `polygon`.

> seems to indicate the need for a follow-up.

The situation is as follows:
* When calling `cube()` with `frame_thickness > 0`,
  the returned object is a `Graphics3dGroup` which contains two objects: a box and a frame.
  Otherwise, only the box is returned.

* To the returned object, the function `prep()` is applied,
  which among other things, sets flat shading for the returned object.

* When converting a `Graphics3dGroup` into json for threejs,
  the dictionary `._extra_kwds` (in which flat shading is set) is ignored.
  Only the `._extra_kwds`'s in the child objects are considered.

I think the function `prep()` does not assume to get a `Graphics3dGroup`.
The only case when it receives one is the case above.
Thus, I suggest a workaround just for the `cube()` by applying the flat shading
on the box object at the beginning of `cube()`:

```
    if 'threejs_flat_shading' not in kwds: 
        kwds['threejs_flat_shading'] = True
```
This `kwds` is passed to the box object.

By the way, the current implementations force the flat shading even if the user
explicitly says they do not want it. So
`cube(threejs_flat_shading=False)`
will produce flat shading.
