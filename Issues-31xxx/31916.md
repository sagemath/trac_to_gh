We introduce new methods `relative_interior` and `interior`, which (in nontrivial cases) return a simple object with a `__contains__` method. 

Then one can write `x in P.relative_interior()` instead of `P.relative_interior_contains(x)`.

This will also simplify #31660.

<a id='comment:9'></a>There are various small things:

The interior of a non-full-dimensional cone should be a cone, not a polyhedron.

Why do you implement `relative_interior` for relative interiors but not `interior`?

Why is `closure` defined for relative interiors, but not for polyhedra or cones? The problem is, that `P.relative_interior().closure()` will not always work.

Comparison will raise `AttributeErrors`, when `other` is the universe.

Can't do - a `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` always contains 0

Done

For this ticket, it's just the accessor to the original polytope, not a more general API. See #31919 (ABC for convex sets), where I am adding such methods.

> Comparison will raise `AttributeErrors`, when `other` is the universe.


Done

I'm not sure, if it also applies to the import.

Really tiny: Does a docstring ending with an example contain an empty line in the end? (Doesn't need to be fixed, I just noticed.)

Maybe for another ticket: Replace the `ppl` imports in `cone.py` by explicity imports to help pyflakes.

Otherwise it's a positive review.
