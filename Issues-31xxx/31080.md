Since #22755, when `lazy_import` is used during startup, a runtime exception is thrown. This leads to problems if you want to use code with lazy imports in a library mode (e.g. in standalone tests or python scripts). 

To support these use cases, this ticket replaces the exception to a `print` (which matches other warnings printed by the same code).
