`pplpy` provides `NNC_Polyhedron` - not-necessarily closed rational polyhedra.

We extend the restrictions code to handle NNC polyhedra as an alternative to SR inequalities (in suitable special cases).

In addition to possible speedups for `valid_coordinates`, `_check_restrictions`, this provides a way to rigorously decide the emptiness of some subsets. #31732
