We turn the algebra of mixed differential forms into a de Rham complex and add it to the category of `ChainComplexes`, see #31669.

Furthermore, we add de Rham cohomology to SageManifolds with limited functionality. For now, the implementation will only consist of abstract elements that are given by representatives of mixed forms, i.e. we take closed mixed forms, put a bracket around it and do all computations in the algebra of mixed forms.

Here is a first draft. Unfortunately I get an error with the current test:


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: C = M.de_rham_complex()
sage: d0 = C.differential(0); d0
Exception raised:
...
ValueError: Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M is not in Category of modules over Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

This is somewhat peculiar. Each algebra should automatically be a module over itself... Should I simply add the category to the scalar field algebra or does that need a broader fix?

I think it would be best to split off the cohomology ring into a separate file.

Do you want to give a special (latex) name to `zero` and `one`?

For the class-level docstring of `DeRahmComologyRing`:

```diff
-Define the de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
The de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
```

I don't think you should assume that the parents are the same for `cup` (unlike what you can do for `_mul_`).

In your `cohomology()` method, you have both `\left.` and `\right.`. I don't understand the point of this.

The input block to `differential()` is over-indented. Also, remove the full-stop/period.

I don't think so. That would make more sense if we can distinguish cohomology classes properly.

What do you mean?

The point is that `\middle/` has the appropriate size.

If you take the `cup` with something the coerces in (perhaps `2`?) but is not actually an element of the same parent, then it will either fail or could end up with an element that is not actually in the ring.

However, it will fail with a much more reasonable message and it will be all setup for when there is a coercion implemented. Most importantly, it will handle the natural coercion from the scalar field into the ring, but `cup` will not. You should have `cup` simply redirect to `*`. This will also make it easier if this ever gets subclassed too.
