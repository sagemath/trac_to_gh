Tab completion on the prefix of a `cached_method` of an extension class not in Sage source code provokes of crash. See https://gitlab.com/videlec/sage_tab_completion_bug to reproduce.

The bug was confirmed reproducibly on

- archlinux sage 9.3.rc2
- online cocalc with sage 9.2 

The bug is not present on

- docker sage 8.8 and 9.1.rc2

## Workaround

Compile your Cython code with

```
import Cython.Compiler.Options
Cython.Compiler.Options.embed_pos_in_docstring = True
```

## Tasks

- #31643: about tab-completion accessing attributes
- fix sage inspection module

Component: **misc**

You should in addition inherit from `SageObject`, when using `cached_method` (or at least try), but this also did not resolve the issue.

Indeed this seems to have appeared at some point recent.

On debian buster I can't reproduce it with sage 9.1, at least not the hard crash. The underlying problem to fetch `a.two.__doc__` is way older, but hasn't lead to a hard crash.

This seems to be related #31480 (which was a blocker, because as you noted hard crashes are annoying and it had a super easy fix). This tab completion hard crash also appeared with some ipython upgrade or so that happened recently.

I see at least three problems:

- Access to the documentation should not trigger the access the source code. The `CachedFunction._instancedoc_` makes a call to `sage_getsourcelines` if the line in the source code is not available. This is exactly what the workaround in the ticket description provides.

- Accessing the documentation/source should never result in a crash

- Why on earth tab-completion have anything to do with access to the documentation?

I believe there is work to be done on different fronts: the `sageinspect` module, the `CachedFunction._instancedoc_` and understand how the tab-completion works.

Ok, yes, I agree with you.

- Sage crashing is very unfortunate behavior and it definitely shouldn't happen because some trivial python error occurs.
- #31480 only fixed the symptoms. The point above applies there as well. But also tab completion should not even trigger loading lazy imports (unless your actually tab completing within the lazy imported thing and then of course it needs to grep the signature via the `inspect` module and maybe this needs to access source or something like this).

To verify that tab completion is doing too much one can do the following:

Start sage fresh

```
sage: type(polytopes._object)
<class 'NoneType'>
```
Hit tab after `pol`. `polytopes` isn't even your first guess, but it's on the list. Now repeat:

```
sage: type(polytopes._object)
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes'>
```
So tab completion does not work well with lazy imports at all.

For me it is even stranger: before the tab and and after the first I still get `None`. Only on the second run it gets lazily imported.

Ah, this probably explains, why it takes two times, until you see the effect.

You do this effect immediatly in memory usage. Tab completion of `h` takes something around 70 MB of memory. How stupid is that.

Also tab completion of `l` gives:

```
sage: l// Giac share root-directory:/home/jonathan/Applications/sage/local/share/giac/
// Giac share root-directory:/home/jonathan/Applications/sage/local/share/giac/
Help file /home/jonathan/Applications/sage/local/share/giac/doc/fr/aide_cas not found
Added 0 synonyms
```

And tab completion twice `s` has sage crash hard again. The essense of it being

```
AttributeError: module 'sage.coding.linear_code' has no attribute 'self_orthogonal_binary_codes'
```
because it is incorrectly lazily imported in `src/sage/coding/all.py`. Implying three things for me:
- Again, sage should not crash hard because of such a silly thing.
- We should have a doctest somewhere that unrolls all lazy imports, just to make sure that they actually work. Apparently this is not being tested.
- Of course it should be fixed in `src/sage/coding/all.py`.

you can have a look at what is asked to your `lazy_import` objects.

Here is what I got (up to desynchronization)

```

```

The three `getattr(attr=XXX) of self=<class 'sage.categories.groups.Groups'>` are definitely unrelated but worth looking at since they should not be there! I thought that resolution of lazy import was forbidden on startup.
