Following #10147, we extend conversion to scalars for polynomials, multi-polynomials and fraction fields.

The attached branch allows the following construction

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: A.<u> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
sage: A((x + 3) / (2*x - 1))
14/15*u^2 + 7/15*u + 11/15
```

See the original report from [asksage](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56762/convert-element-from-fraction-field-of-polynomial-ring-to-number-field/).
