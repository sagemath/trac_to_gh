The spkg-configure files for the following packages
mix tabs and spaces:
arb brial cmake flint gcc gfortran git gmp iml
ninja_build pari patch pcre ppl python3 symmetrica.

This ticket is to make them use spaces only.

Note however discussion at #13899 warns against
changing whitespace in a lot of files at once.

Previous related tickets:

- #15436: Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex
- #13899: Don't use TAB characters for indentation
- #13146: Removing tabs in .rst, .tex and .pxi files

This shell command spots files with tabs
when run from the Sage root folder:

```bash
$ git grep $'\t' . | cut -f 1 -d ":" | uniq \
  | grep -v Make | grep -v -e '^Binary' | grep -v patches
```
In Sage 9.3 it reveals:

The m4 and C-language changes all look fine to me at first glance. I'm probably responsible for a few of the tabs in spkg-configure.m4, but I do indeed prefer spaces when I'm paying attention.

Are magma and GP whitespace-insensitive too?
