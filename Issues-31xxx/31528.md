The spkg-configure files for the following packages
mix tabs and spaces:
arb brial cmake flint gcc gfortran git gmp iml
ninja_build pari patch pcre ppl python3 symmetrica.

This ticket is to make them use spaces only.

Note however discussion at #13899 warns against
changing whitespace in a lot of files at once.

Previous related tickets:

- #15436: Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex
- #13899: Don't use TAB characters for indentation
- #13146: Removing tabs in .rst, .tex and .pxi files

This shell command spots files with tabs
when run from the Sage root folder:

```bash
$ git grep $'\t' . | cut -f 1 -d ":" | uniq \
  | grep -v Make | grep -v -e '^Binary' | grep -v patches
```
In Sage 9.3 it reveals:

The m4 and C-language changes all look fine to me at first glance. I'm probably responsible for a few of the tabs in spkg-configure.m4, but I do indeed prefer spaces when I'm paying attention.

Are magma and GP whitespace-insensitive too?

I think that gp does not care. No idea about magma, but it certainly does not require TABs.

I took a closer look and added two commits to fix the indentation where it was weird. There are still others, but I don't have time to go through and fix them all. They're not new issues.

The GP change is OK too. I have no way to run the magma code, but since there are already spaces in that file, I guess it's unlikely that changing some existing tabs into more spaces will cause a problem.

If someone can double-check my two new commits (which should contain only whitespace changes), please set to positive review after.

In `build/pkgs/iml/spkg-configure.m4`, besides
fixing indentation, you remove two lines.

Is that intended?
