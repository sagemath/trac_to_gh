Before this ticket, the layout for the cube graph uses a projection
which sends several vertices to the same coordinates,
see vertices '010' and '101' below:

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
sage: G.layout()
{'000': (0.0, 0.0),
 '001': (-0.4999999999999998, 0.8660254037844387),
 '010': (0.5000000000000001, 0.8660254037844386),
 '011': (3.3306690738754696e-16, 1.7320508075688772),
 '100': (1.0, 0.0),
 '101': (0.5000000000000002, 0.8660254037844387),
 '110': (1.5, 0.8660254037844386),
 '111': (1.0000000000000002, 1.7320508075688772)}
```

This ticket provides an alternate layout in which
all vertices get distinct coordinates.

This drawing is not "broken". It is a particular projection in the plane. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube.

We can certainly propose other drawings of the cube graph. This would be a nice improvement. Would you like to do it ?
