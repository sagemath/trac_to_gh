The tests at the top of build/bin/sage-build-env all use the bash double-equals comparison:

```
if [ "x$CFLAGS" == "x" ]; then
    export ORIGINAL_CFLAGS="$CONFIGURED_CFLAGS"
else
    export ORIGINAL_CFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
if [ "x$CXXFLAGS" == "x" ]; then
...
```

This doesn't do what we want when /bin/sh is something else (as is often the case on Debian, Gentoo,...):

```
$ /bin/sh build/bin/sage-build-env
build/bin/sage-build-env: 27: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 32: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 37: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 42: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 49: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 72: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 85: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
build/bin/sage-build-env: 98: [: x-O2 -pipe -march=native: unexpected operator
```

Fix is easy: use one equals sign.
