Computing the discriminant group of an integral lattice causes 
both to persist in memory.

```
sage: L = IntegralLattice("A2") 
sage: for k in range(1,500): 
....:     G = L.twist(k) 
sage: gc.collect() 
sage: len([a for a in gc.get_objects() if type(a)==type(L)])

Creating thousands of lattices and computing their discriminant groups is actually a common use case. Serious computations are impossible with this kind of memory leak.

`L.discriminant_group()` is cached. Removing the cache is a possible fix to the leak. However it seems very natural for a lattice to remember its discriminant group. And is basically the only reasonable way to create such things. 
On the other hand the discriminant group knows about its lattice covering lattice (it has to). 

Another option to fix the leak is to remove `CachedRepresentation` from the discriminant group. 

Not sure how to proceed here.  And there are other instances of this kind of memory leak.

`discriminant_group()` is something that is called quite frequently by the user. Creating 
it is not too expensive so okay. 

But computing generators for the `orthogonal_group()` is very expensive. 
So I think here unique representation does not help a lot. Storing it on its domain seems better.

Your `"""` is not aligned properly (see the diff) and your added doctests need to be indented.

(I am slightly squeamish about adding such a doctest for the memory leak, but not enough to not include it.)
