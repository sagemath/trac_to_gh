Marc Culler has a new binary distribution of Sage for macOS that is fully signed and notarized, eliminating the many problems with the current official Sage binary caused by Apple's gatekeeper antimalware protections.

Initial version of English language docs. Because the old "app" version is going away in 9.3, I also updated the install instructions for the official binaries.
