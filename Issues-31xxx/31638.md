Marc Culler has a new binary distribution of Sage for macOS that is fully signed and notarized, eliminating the many problems with the current official Sage binary caused by Apple's gatekeeper antimalware protections.

This ticket adds a reference to this distribution in the install docs. It is related to #31000.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Initial version of English language docs. Because the old "app" version is going away in 9.3, I also updated the install instructions for the official binaries.

What do people think?

Shouldn't this app be the preferred way to install on MacOS? I mean shouldn't it appear first?

To my mind it is mandatory to make them available on the mirrors.

`@`Volker: could we have it for 9.3?
