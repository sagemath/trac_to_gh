# Issue 31004: src/tox.ini: Rename pycodestyle to pycodestyle-minimal, add full pycodestyle as recommendation

This is a good idea. Two points:

1) I think using `pycodestyle-minimal` would be more tox-ic (tox factor conditions)


2) I think `envlist` at the top should do `pycodestyle-minimal`, not `pycodestyle`. This affects the default when `-e` is not used.

I'm not sure what you mean, but `sage -advanced` doesn't show any tox-related infos for me (but the indent for example ecl is off). Maybe it's because I also get the following error when running `sage`:

```
