This is a good idea. Two points:

1) I think using `pycodestyle-minimal` would be more tox-ic (tox factor conditions)


2) I think `envlist` at the top should do `pycodestyle-minimal`, not `pycodestyle`. This affects the default when `-e` is not used.

I'm not sure what you mean, but `sage -advanced` doesn't show any tox-related infos for me (but the indent for example ecl is off). Maybe it's because I also get the following error when running `sage`:

This is an interesting error - something seems to be rewriting this shell scripts as if it is a Python script - perhaps the newest version of pip?

-The current pycodestyle configuration only covers a few rules that are also enforced by the patchbot. While this is a good starting point, IDEs pick up this configuration and only show warnings for these rules. In order to make sage's code adhere more to the pep8 recommendations, it is desirable to get warnings for all code style errors. Thus, in this ticket, we enable all pycodestyle warnings. These can be tested as usually by calling `pycodestyle` or `tox -e pycodestyle`. Moreover, the current minimal ruleset is tested via the new environment `tox -e pycodestyle_minimal`, which is also used in the new lint github action workflow.

Maybe because I invoke `sage` from within `pipenv shell` (to activate the correct venv)?
