Using the face as a bitset is much much faster than creating a list. Well there would be a faster method for the second case by comparing directly the array instead of the list, but I don't think this case is very important anyway.

Here is some speed comparison:

Even the very difficult first case (`f2` is indeed a subface of `f`) only takes a few nano seconds to check all `2^14` bits. In comparison the other case is really slow (but it is also not optimized at all).

If speed is a concern, then I'd recommend to check `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` at least.

Does a face know about the original combinatorial polyhedron `C`? Is `f2.is_subface(f1)`   through something like `C.face_iter().find_face(f1).only_subfaces().find_face(f2)` faster than comparing `ambient_V_indices()`?

If it's not too complicated to implement, this sounds like a great solution! I don't have a direct use case of "f1 and f2 not in the same mode", so I feel good about the ticket even if you won't implement the additional speed-up. However, I'd like to include the `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` check, as mentioned above.

I don't have a direct use case of "f1 and f2 not in the same mode", so I feel good about the ticket even if you won't implement the additional speed-up. However, I'd like to include the `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` check, as mentioned above. 

The check `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` is no improvement either way, when `self` and `other` are in same mode.

Here are the new timings:
