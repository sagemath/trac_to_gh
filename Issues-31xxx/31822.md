It works fine in the intended case.

However, it should raise an error, when `self` and `other` or not from the same `CombinatorialPolyhedron` (`NotImplementedError`?) and it should consider the case that `self` is from a dual face iterator and `other isn't.

`is_subface` looks correct. However I don't understand why you distinguished two cases on whether`self._dual == other_face._dual`. It seems to me that the `ambient_V_indices` containment check always works. Is it because using `face_issubset` in the first case is faster? Then, how about using `only_subfaces`?

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: C = P.combinatorial_polyhedron()
```
is repeated in the doctest.

Using the face as a bitset is much much faster than creating a list. Well there would be a faster method for the second case by comparing directly the array instead of the list, but I don't think this case is very important anyway.

Here is some speed comparison:

```

1.06 ms ± 256 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

Even the very difficult first case (`f2` is indeed a subface of `f`) only takes a few nano seconds to check all `2^14` bits. In comparison the other case is really slow (but it is also not optimized at all).

If speed is a concern, then I'd recommend to check `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` at least.

Does a face know about the original combinatorial polyhedron `C`? Is `f2.is_subface(f1)`   through something like `C.face_iter().find_face(f1).only_subfaces().find_face(f2)` faster than comparing `ambient_V_indices()`?

I don't have a direct use case of "f1 and f2 not in the same mode", so I feel good about the ticket even if you won't implement the additional speed-up. However, I'd like to include the `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` check, as mentioned above. 

The check `self.dimension() <= other.dimension()` is no improvement either way, when `self` and `other` are in same mode.

Here are the new timings:

Btw, currently `face.coatom_rep` etc. is reinitialized. I expect things to be much faster on repeated calls, if I change the code to realize this.

However, this might be the more honest timing, as it reflects more realistic the amount of time the first call needs.
