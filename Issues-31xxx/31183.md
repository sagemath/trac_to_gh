Do you know at what point in the build process the variable MACOSX_VERSION gets set? I just checked out the ticket and ran

./configure\\
make scipy-clean\\
make scipy

but it fails because MACOSX_VERSION isn't picked up.  I'd like to test the ticket but I'd rather not have to rebuild sage from scratch.

It feels like this is a problem homebrew should be able to fix, which in turn would allow scipy to compile without any problems.

I never know the right way to handle this. What works best for the release manager? Do the patchbots pay attention to the dependencies field? If they touched the same code and so one had to be merged first, it would be clear what to do.
