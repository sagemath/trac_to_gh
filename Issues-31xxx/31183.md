Do you know at what point in the build process the variable MACOSX_VERSION gets set? I just checked out the ticket and ran

./configure

make scipy-clean

make scipy

but it fails because MACOSX_VERSION isn't picked up.  I'd like to test the ticket but I'd rather not have to rebuild sage from scratch.

It's not important for the present ticket because you have tested it sufficiently on your machines. But in general, for the purpose of portability testing with GH Actions, we need branches that have merged the branches of the dependencies.
