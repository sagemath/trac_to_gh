I never know the right way to handle this. What works best for the release manager? Do the patchbots pay attention to the dependencies field? If they touched the same code and so one had to be merged first, it would be clear what to do.

No, the patchbots only merge the branch into the current beta. Only Volker's release management scripts read the dependencies field.

It's not important for the present ticket because you have tested it sufficiently on your machines. But in general, for the purpose of portability testing with GH Actions, we need branches that have merged the branches of the dependencies.
