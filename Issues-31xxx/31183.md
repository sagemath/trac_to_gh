Do you know at what point in the build process the variable MACOSX_VERSION gets set? I just checked out the ticket and ran

./configure\\
make scipy-clean\\
make scipy

but it fails because MACOSX_VERSION isn't picked up.  I'd like to test the ticket but I'd rather not have to rebuild sage from scratch.
