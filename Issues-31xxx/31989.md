In [Ask SageMath question #57568](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57568/building-a-homomorphism-from-group-algebra-to-matrix-space/) it was pointed out that homomorphisms from a `GroupAlgebra` over a `FreeGroup` to a `MatrixSpace` are not implemented, e.g.:

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(4, names='A,B,C,D')
sage: G = GroupAlgebra(F, ZZ)
sage: A,B,C,D = G.gens()
sage: A1 = matrix(CC,[[0,I],[I,0]])
sage: B1 = matrix(CC,[[I,0],[0,-I]])
sage: C1 = matrix(CC,[[0,1],[-1,0]])
sage: G.hom([A1,B1,C1,C1])
...
NotImplementedError: Verification of correctness of homomorphisms from Algebra of Free Group on generators {A, B, C, D} over Integer Ring not yet implemented.
sage: f = G.hom([A1,B1,C1,C1], check=False)
sage: f(A^2 + B^3 + C)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

As mentioned in my answer there, we have the following straightforward workaround:

```
def my_im_gens_(self, codomain, im_gens, base_map=None):
    result = codomain.zero()
    for (g,c) in self._monomial_coefficients.items():
        if base_map:
            c = base_map(c)
        result += c*g(im_gens)
    return result
G.element_class._im_gens_ = my_im_gens_
```

Then it works:

```
sage: f(A^2 + B^3 + C) == A1^2 + B1^3 + C1
True
```

For a proper fix, the `_im_gens_` method of `GroupAlgebra.element_class` should be implemented, in a way similar to the workaround. Probably it works more generally than the case described in the title.

Also, it would be nice not to have to specify `check=False` in this particular case, because there is nothing to check.
