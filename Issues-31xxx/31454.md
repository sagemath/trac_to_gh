1)

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a').is_growing('a')
True
```
should return `False`.

This happens due to the `if self.is_primitive(): return True` optimization. Easily fixable for example like this:

```diff
-       if self.is_primitive():
+       if self.is_primitive() and len(self._morph) > 1:
            return True
```
2)

```
sage: WordMorphism('a->a,b->bb').periodic_points()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: generator already executing
```
should return `[This is the Trac macro *word: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#word: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb...-macro)`.

I think this happens because `periodic_points()` doesn't check whether the letters are growing, so the following should fix it (assuming we only care about periodic points with infinite length):

```diff
        A = self.domain().alphabet()
        d = dict((letter,self(letter)[0]) for letter in A)
+       G = set(self.growing_letters())

        res = []
        parent = self.codomain().shift()
        for cycle in get_cycles(CallableDict(d),A):
+           if cycle[0] in G:
                P = PeriodicPointIterator(self, cycle)
                res.append([parent(P._cache[i]) for i in range(len(cycle))])
```

I added a branch with the proposed fixes.
