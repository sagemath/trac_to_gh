Instead of full packaging of CGAL started in #18197, in this ticket we create a script package for CGAL just to record system package information. Likewise we create a script package for swig, which is needed for building Python bindings.

We create a normal package that provides the current HEAD of the main branch of https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings

The PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/cgal-bindings/ (pointing to https://github.com/sciencectn/cgal-bindings) is not current and in fact appears to be an unmaintained fork of https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings.

- Here is a useful code snippet to test whether cgal has been installed successfully 
https://github.com/DRKWang/Efficient-geometric-data-structures/blob/main/tests/Test%20for%20installation.py
- More example for testing can be found here: 
https://github.com/DRKWang/cgal-swig-bindings/tree/main/examples/python

Other CGAL bindings:

- https://github.com/scikit-geometry/scikit-geometry (alpha quality, not on PyPI); https://wolfv.medium.com/introducing-scikit-geometry-ae1dccaad5fd

Other pointers:

I tried it with `cmake --find-package -DNAME=CGAL -DLANGUAGE=C -DCOMPILER_ID=GNU -DMODE=COMPILE` and it returned `-I/usr/local/include` instead of what we expect --`/usr/local/opt/cgal/lib/cmake/CGAL`.

Besides, I also tried to install it without this setting and it turns out that setting `-DCGAL_DIR` manually is not necessary. The reason might be that `find_package(CGAL REQUIRED OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS ImageIO)` in `CMakeLists.txt` performs the same duty as the `cmake --find-package`.

I have created the fork(https://github.com/DRKWang/cgal-swig-bindings) and also update the `upstream_url` and has pushed them. Please take a look.

I have added some test code, which comes from the official website of cgal_swig_bindings. But I am a little confused about what is the purpose of adding those test code, does it serve as checking whether the sage has been installed successfully, or checking each module of it can be performed without errors?
If the former, I think those codes are enough, if the latter, those files are supposed to be shrunk into a file.

+https://github.com/DRKWang/Efficient-geometric-data-structures/blob/main/tests/Test%20for%20installation.py
+- More example for testing can be found here:
