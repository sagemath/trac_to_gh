Instead of full packaging of CGAL started in #18197, in this ticket we create a script package for CGAL just to record system package information. Likewise we create a script package for swig, which is needed for building Python bindings.

We create a normal package that provides the current HEAD of the main branch of https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings

The PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/cgal-bindings/ (pointing to https://github.com/sciencectn/cgal-bindings) is not current and in fact appears to be an unmaintained fork of https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings.

- Here is a useful code snippet to test whether cgal has been installed successfully 
https://github.com/DRKWang/Efficient-geometric-data-structures/blob/main/tests/Test%20for%20installation.py
- More example for testing can be found here: 
https://github.com/DRKWang/cgal-swig-bindings/tree/main/examples/python

Other CGAL bindings:

- https://github.com/scikit-geometry/scikit-geometry (alpha quality, not on PyPI); https://wolfv.medium.com/introducing-scikit-geometry-ae1dccaad5fd

The tarball can not be pushed because git ignored the upstream folder, where the tarball is stored. This tarball basically comes from compressing those files under the CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings repository and I change it a little bit. I will update the checksums.ini file and add `upstream_url` to it later, but I am not sure what platform I should upload it to.

Here's how to do this:
- Create a fork of https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings into your [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) account
- Make a release
- Then use the archive that [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) creates for the release as the upstream URL.

I tried it with `cmake --find-package -DNAME=CGAL -DLANGUAGE=C -DCOMPILER_ID=GNU -DMODE=COMPILE` and it returned `-I/usr/local/include` instead of what we expect --`/usr/local/opt/cgal/lib/cmake/CGAL`. This script does return the right directory based on those parameters but it only gives CGAL library containing `.h` file, whereas we hope to find CGAL library full of `.cmake` file. I also tried to set `-DLANGUAGE=cmake`, but it does not work because language options do not contain it according to this description(https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html#:~:text=Supported%20languages%20include%20C%20%2C%20CXX,no%20language%20options%20are%20given.).

Besides, I also tried to install it without this setting and it turns out that setting `-DCGAL_DIR` manually is not necessary. The reason might be that `find_package(CGAL REQUIRED OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS ImageIO)` in `CMakeLists.txt` performs the same duty as the `cmake --find-package`.

see if you can force cmake to use the specific python executable used in Sage instead:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/19492#note_603445

In the `spkg-install` script you can refer to it as `"$SAGE_VENV"/bin/python3`.

I have added some test code, which comes from the official website of cgal_swig_bindings. But I am a little confused about what is the purpose of adding those test code, does it serve as checking whether the sage has been installed successfully, or checking each module of it can be performed without errors?
If the former, I think those codes are enough, if the latter, those files are supposed to be shrunk into a file.
