The Github workflow added in #30371 times out after more or less exactly 2.5h of execution time during the doctest run. I guess the problem is that we run out of memory, but I'm not sure why. I cannot reproduce this locally, which makes it hard to diagnose. Any suggestions of how to do this are welcome.
