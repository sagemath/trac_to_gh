It makes no sense that we offer to install an ancient version of git from source. 

On `fedora-26-minimal` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1850248210),
it fails:

```
make -C perl  PERL_PATH='/usr/bin/perl' prefix='/sage/local' localedir='/sage/local/share/locale' all
/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL PREFIX='/sage/local' INSTALL_BASE='' --localedir='/sage/local/share/locale'
Can't locate ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm in @INC (you may need to install the ExtUtils::MakeMaker module) (@INC contains: /sage/local/lib/perl5 /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 .) at Makefile.PL line 3.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at Makefile.PL line 3.
make[6]: *** [Makefile:83: perl.mak] Error 2
```

We reduce `git` to an optional script package - so that we can continue to advertise system packages providing it. (See also #30201)

Why even optional? What benefit does having git installed provide to a normal user?

My perspective is: if you have even the slightest idea what git is or what you would do with it... you don't need sage to suggest that you install it.
