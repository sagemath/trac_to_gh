(un)fortunately at some point Sage became de facto upstream for lcalc, and tracing the history of changes is not fun...

It's done AFAIK. The only thing left to do is run `make dist` in the lcalc repo, install it to the system, and see if it works with sage. Hopefully not too many changes are needed. The header location is now "officially" installed to `lcalc/L.h` but that's the only breaking change that I know of for sure.

If everything works, I can release v2.0.0 and we can upgrade the spkg.

The lcalc-2.0.0 upgrade ticket is at #32037 with some proof-of-concept patches that I hacked together. Not all of the doctest changes are simple fixes:  two of the answers have changed, and I don't know which is correct.

I would recommend pulling in one of the distro patches to fix the gcc-11 problem for sage-9.4, since upgrading lcalc may take some time.
