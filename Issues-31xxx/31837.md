It's done AFAIK. The only thing left to do is run `make dist` in the lcalc repo, install it to the system, and see if it works with sage. Hopefully not too many changes are needed. The header location is now "officially" installed to `lcalc/L.h` but that's the only breaking change that I know of for sure.

If everything works, I can release v2.0.0 and we can upgrade the spkg.

The lcalc-2.0.0 upgrade ticket is at #32037 with some proof-of-concept patches that I hacked together. Not all of the doctest changes are simple fixes:  two of the answers have changed, and I don't know which is correct.

I would recommend pulling in one of the distro patches to fix the gcc-11 problem for sage-9.4, since upgrading lcalc may take some time.
