The lcalc-2.0.0 upgrade ticket is at #32037 with some proof-of-concept patches that I hacked together. Not all of the doctest changes are simple fixes:  two of the answers have changed, and I don't know which is correct.

I would recommend pulling in one of the distro patches to fix the gcc-11 problem for sage-9.4, since upgrading lcalc may take some time.
