By definition, the `-maximal` environments install all system packages of standard and optional packages - whether they have `spkg-configure.m4` or not.

As we add more and more system packages, this can lead to failures on non-current distributions: For example `ubuntu-focal` as can be seen in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2156547051:

```
E: Unable to locate package libgap-dev
```

In this ticket, we fix this by setting `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=yes` for all `-maximal` environments (but override it for the cutting edge versions of the distributions). 
In this way, there is still error checking (which will catch typos in the system package information).

(For consistency, the changes are also made both for `docker-` and for `local-` environments such as `local-homebrew-macos` -- but `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` is currently only handled by the `docker-` technology.)

To test:
- `tox -e docker-ubuntu-focal-maximal -- config.status` should no longer give an error. The use of the `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=yes` installation mode can be recognized by the output 
   {{{
Reading package lists...
.libgd-dev.yasm.libgmp-dev.libiml-dev.gfan.gfortran.libncurses5-dev.python3.libpython3-dev.python3-distutils.singular.libsingular4-dev.libmpfi-dev.libsymmetrica2-dev.flintqs.libfreetype6-dev.libmpfr-dev.libcdd-dev.libcdd-tools.libbraiding-dev.libpynac-dev.libbrial-dev.libbrial-groebner-dev.libppl-dev.ppl-dev.sympow.libzn-poly-dev.libzmq3-dev.libreadline-dev.r-base-dev.r-cran-lattice.libgf2x-dev.gcc.g++.libratpoints-dev.libsqlite3-dev.sqlite3.tachyon.libgiac-dev.xcas.libz-dev.xz-utils.liblzma-dev.libm4rie-dev.libopenblas-dev.curl.libcurl4-openssl-dev.libntl-dev.pkg-config.patch.glpk-utils.libglpk-dev..fflas-ffpack.lib.
}}}
   (which probes the existence of the packages one by one)

- `tox -e docker-ubuntu-focal-standard -- config.status` still uses `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=no` installation mode

- `tox -e docker-ubuntu-groovy-maximal -- config.status` still uses `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=no` installation mode (this is the rolling ubuntu distribution)

- `tox -e docker-ubuntu-hirsute-maximal -- config.status` (and also `tox -e docker-ubuntu-hirsute-standard -- config.status`) now use `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=yes` installation mode so that we do not trip over intermittent packaging problems in this unstable distribution
