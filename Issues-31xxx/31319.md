Creating the integer partitions of an integer `N` with parts restricted to a list `L` takes much longer than creating the weighted integer vectors of `N` with weights in `L`. In principle one should be able to translate between these two constructions, so perhaps it would be better to compute `Partitions(N, parts_in=L)` by calling `WeightedIntegerVectors(N, L)` and then transferring the results accordingly? Below are two examples where this manifests.

This code sees how far Sage can compute in 100 seconds with respect to both functions:

```
import time
a = time.time()
i = 0
L = []
while time.time() - a < 100:
    i += 1
    L.append(len(WeightedIntegerVectors(i, [1000, 1001])))
print(len(L))
```

```
a = time.time()
i = 0
L = []
while time.time() - a < 100:
    i += 1
    L.append(len(Partitions(i, parts_in=[1000, 1001])))
print(len(L))
```
The result of the first block is 321269, whereas the second is 41686 (for me).

Another example: this code computes the Frobenius number of `[1000, 1001]` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem) by starting at the naive upper bound and working downwards:

```
import time
a = time.time()
for i in range(1000*1001, 0, -1):
    if any(_ for _ in WeightedIntegerVectors(i, parts_in=[1000, 1001])):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
        break
```

```
a = time.time()
for i in range(1000*1001, 0, -1):
    if any(_ for _ in Partitions(i, parts_in=[1000, 1001])):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
        break
```

The first code block runs in 0.83 seconds whereas the second takes 249.96 seconds to evaluate (for me).

A very basic attempt at a fix for this would be something like 

```
def PartitionPartsIn(N, L):
    sortL = sorted(L, reverse=True)
    for wIV in WeightedIntegerVectors(N, sortL):
        a = []
        for i in range(len(sortL)):
            a += [sortL[i]]*wIV[i]
        yield(a)
```
Of course this would have to be adapted into the Partitions class, but it seems like that should be no issue as long as the `parts_in` flag is taken into account. Even this crude fix gives me much better performance on the two tasks above.

You can make this even faster by using the `iterator_fast` function in `integer_vector_weighted.py`. That way you don't have an additional transient element, just lists being returned. So I would do it like this:

```python
        from sage.combinat.integer_vector_weighted import iterator_fast
        sorted_parts = sorted(parts, reverse=True)
        for vec in iterator_fast(n, sorted_parts):
            yield sum([pi] *  multi for pi, multi in zip(sorted_parts, vec), []
```
This should be the fastest way to do things.

This probably can be easily modified to work for k-regular/restricted partitions as well, but that can be a separate ticket.
