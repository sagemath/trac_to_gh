Part of #29413.

TOPCOM home page has moved to:

- https://www.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/rambau_joerg/TOPCOM/

For what's new in 1.1.x, see the changelog at:

- https://www.wm.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/rambau_joerg/TOPCOM/ChangeLog.txt

Our 0.17.7 tarball was built using `spkg-src` and deposited in https://github.com/mkoeppe/topcom; but there is no git repository.

Arch linux already has an 1.1.x package - https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/topcom/trunk/PKGBUILD

I didn't have any luck with it. I tried to figure it out the entire forenoon, which is way more time then I wanted to spend with it.

Tried to use the check from latte, but it always ends like this:

```
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] checking for CDDLIB >= 093c... configure: headers are not in cddlib/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in inclusion directory
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in cdd/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] not found
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] checking for CDDLIB >= 093c... configure: headers are not in cddlib/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in inclusion directory
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in cdd/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] not found
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: error: The cddlib headers and library are required for topcom.
```

Probably didn't have gmp linked in and thus couldn't compile the tests.

I pushed the tries here: https://github.com/kliem/topcom/

All that seems to be needed is to modify `lib-src-reg/LPinterface.hh` to use `#include CDDLIB_SETOPER_H` and `#include CDDLIB_CDD_H`.

Anyway, it seems to be one big mess.

I am not sure whether proper updating makes much sense. It seems topcom underwent a serious rewrite since the last changes in https://github.com/kliem/topcom/, with qiute a bit of C++ and examples added - while changes in https://github.com/kliem/topcom/ were not used.
I sure can overwrite https://github.com/kliem/topcom/ with 1.1.1+my patches, otherwise it looks like too much work for little gain.
