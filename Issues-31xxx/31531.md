> automake/autoconf initialization. In the previous
> version 0.17.7, accidentally a wrong version of gmp
> was included. Furthermore, a bug was fixed where

I didn't have any luck with it. I tried to figure it out the entire forenoon, which is way more time then I wanted to spend with it.

Tried to use the check from latte, but it always ends like this:

```
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] checking for CDDLIB >= 093c... configure: headers are not in cddlib/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in inclusion directory
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in cdd/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] not found
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] checking for CDDLIB >= 093c... configure: headers are not in cddlib/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in inclusion directory
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: headers are not in cdd/
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] not found
[topcom-0.17.8-beta.11] configure: error: The cddlib headers and library are required for topcom.
```

Probably didn't have gmp linked in and thus couldn't compile the tests.

I pushed the tries here: https://github.com/kliem/topcom/

All that seems to be needed is to modify `lib-src-reg/LPinterface.hh` to use `#include CDDLIB_SETOPER_H` and `#include CDDLIB_CDD_H`.

Anyway, it seems to be one big mess.

I am not sure whether proper updating makes much sense. It seems topcom underwent a serious rewrite since the last changes in https://github.com/kliem/topcom/, with qiute a bit of C++ and examples added - while changes in https://github.com/kliem/topcom/ were not used.
I sure can overwrite https://github.com/kliem/topcom/ with 1.1.1+my patches, otherwise it looks like too much work for little gain.
