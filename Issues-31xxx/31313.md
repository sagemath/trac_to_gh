Reproducer:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.gen_quadrangles_with_spread import is_GQ_with_spread, dual_GQ_ovoid  # line 270
sage: t = designs.generalised_quadrangle_hermitian_with_ovoid(3)  # line 272
sage: t = dual_GQ_ovoid(*t)  # line 273
sage: is_GQ_with_spread(*t, s=3, t=9)  # line 274
```
For example, running the last `is_GQ_with_spread` command eats about 170MB per invocation that is never released.

The relevant tests were marked as `# known bug` in #30517.

Fixed by changing `A[i][j]` to `A[i, j]` to access matrix entries.

This avoids the memory leak which turns out to be
in accessing matrix rows and is now tracked at #31340.

Depends on #30517

For me,

```
from sage.combinat.designs.gen_quadrangles_with_spread import is_GQ_with_spread, dual_GQ_ovoid ## line 270 ##
t = designs.generalised_quadrangle_hermitian_with_ovoid(3) ## line 272 ##
t = dual_GQ_ovoid(*t) ## line 273 ##
for n in [1..20]:
    is_GQ_with_spread(*t, s=3, t=9) ## line 274 ##
    print(get_memory_usage())
```

does NOT show increased memory usage. Putting the other commands inside the loop doesn't create a leak either. This is on Sage 9.2.

I apologize if this is noise, but it appears to me that this leak has nothing to do with quadrangles. Instead, the problem seems to be that there is a memory leak in the construction of bipartite graphs:

```
sage: m = 150
....: n = 200
....: A = Matrix(ZZ, m, n)
....: for j in range(n):
....:     i = randint(0,m-2)
....:     A[i, j] = 1
....:     A[i+1, j] = 1
....: def graph(A):
....:     G = Graph(A)
....: def bipartite(A):
....:     G = BipartiteGraph(A)
....: start_mem = get_memory_usage()
....: for n in [1..10]:
....:     prev_mem = get_memory_usage()
....:     graph(A)
....:     print("graph:", get_memory_usage() - prev_mem)
....:     prev_mem = get_memory_usage()
....:     bipartite(A)
....:     print("bipartite:", get_memory_usage() - prev_mem, get_memory_usage() - start
....: _mem)
graph: 0.14453125

bipartite: 47.00390625 279.3125

bipartite: 48.0 327.3125

bipartite: 46.0 582.3203125

This was on MacOS. On `CoCalc`, I got a consistent bipartite leak of 93.84375.

If my diagnosis is correct, then we might be able to solve the problem on this ticket just by changing `A[jj][ii]` to `A[jj,ii]`. I'll write a patch to try that out.

If it works, we can open a different ticket about the memory leak of `A[jj]`.

Thanks for fixing this and opening the follow-up ticket #31340!

Ideally, `all`, `any`, `sum`, `prod` should be
called on generators rather than lists when possible.

When coming across cases of use with list,
it's good to replace them.

```diff
-        sage: all([x in t[0] for x in t[1]])
+        sage: all(x in t[0] for x in t[1])
```

Not the point of this ticket though; will be done elsewhere.

I am semi-regularly getting errors with the new doctest

```

Failed example:
    print(round(get_memory_usage() - start_mem))
Expected:

Got:

This is on OS X Big Sur and all recent Sage betas and rcs. I can reproduce with an interactive Sage session: if I run the loop

```
sage: for _ in range(10):
....:     make_bip_graph(A)
....:
```
it will sometimes cause an increase in memory usage.

Can you capture the particular A for which you get this failure, and attach it here?
Of course it might be macOS-specific...

I have attached one example, but the following is quite repeatable for me:

- start a fresh Sage session and do this:

```
sage: A = Matrix(ZZ, 100, 125)
sage: for i in range(A.nrows()):
....:     for j in Subsets(A.ncols()).random_element():
....:         A[i, j-1] = 1
....:
sage: def make_bip_graph(A):
....:     G = BipartiteGraph(A)
....:
sage: start_mem = get_memory_usage()
```
Then I repeat these commands

```
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     make_bip_graph(A)
....:
sage: print(round(get_memory_usage() - start_mem))
```
and the output often, but not always, increases. Every time I've started Sage, I have seen an increase: it doesn't seem to rely on a very specific value of `A`.

Further, if in the same Sage session, I redefine `A` by `A = Matrix(...)` and then use the loop `for i in ...`, then I don't see the memory leak any more, no matter how many times I iterate `make_bip_graph(A)`.

Can it increase multiple times per session? Or is it just one time per session that this happens?

Also what happens if you do first

```

and then

```
gc.collect()

right before every call of `get_memory_usage()`

indeed, what John sees might be merely a bug in this doctest.
Without `gc.collect()` calls, it is not reliable, IMHO.
E.g. in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` on has

```
        Test that computing the face lattice does not lead to a memory leak::

            sage: import gc
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: P = polytopes.cube()
            sage: a = P.face_lattice()
            sage: n = get_memory_usage()
            sage: P = polytopes.cube()
            sage: a = P.face_lattice()
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: n == get_memory_usage()
            True
```

this is the only other memory leak test in the library which uses `get_memory_usage()` - other places merely use it for information (or just it's a useless `import` which can go).

I've opened #31671 to fix this.
