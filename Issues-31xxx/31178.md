Thanks for reporting this. The problem was that quotient rings can have generators which are constant:

```
sage: R2.gens()
(0, ybar)
```
Because of this, the check for testing whether an element is contained in the subring generated by certain variables failed.

I have replaced the check by a better and clearer one, which should resolve the issue.
