```
MathJax2 converts TeX and LaTeX math delimiter pairs such as $, $$, \(, \), \[,\] to script tag <script type="math/tex">...</script>, and then renders the scripts.

MathJax3 directly renders maths in the math delimiters.

Currently Sage renders maths in LaTeX to html with script tags, which are recognized only by MathJax2. 

To pave the way for transiting Sage to MathJax3, we make Sage output MathJax3 compatible htmls.

With this patch, Sage works both with MathJax2 and MathJax3.

(this patch also contains a small fix for tables)
