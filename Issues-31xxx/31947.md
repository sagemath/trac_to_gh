... like #31914 for `RealSet`.

Using this method, we can then implement `ConvexSet.as_condition_set` or `as_relational` (see #24176), which converts to SymPy's [ConditionSet](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/sets.html#conditionset).

Also, any `Set_base` should convert to `SR`, generalizing the code from #24171.
