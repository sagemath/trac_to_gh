Keywords: specialization, qqbar

When specializing a polynomial `f` in a tower of polynomial rings to a special value using `f.specialization`, the parent of the returned polynomial is inconsistent.

Consider first the case when the base of the tower is `QQ`:

```
sage: K.<t> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x + t
sage: f1 = f.specialization({t: 1}); f1
x + 1
sage: f1.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

On the other hand, if the base of the tower is `QQbar`, the specialized polynomial remains a polynomial in `x` and `t`:

```
sage: K.<t> = QQbar[]
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x + t
sage: f1 = f.specialization({t: 1}); f1
x + 1
sage: f1.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Algebraic Field
```

Note that the value is substituted correctly, but unlike for `QQ` `f1`'s parent is `R` and not `QQbar["x"]` as I would expect.

I can see that this happens because a different `SpecializationMorphism` is constructed in the two cases. I believe the difference lies in line 547 of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/flatten.py` (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/flatten.py?h=9.2#n547)), where for `QQ` the list `new` is empty (when dealing with the ring `K`) while for `QQbar` the list `new` contains the variable `t`. This causes the tower to be reconstructed differently.

The reason that `t` is considered a new variable in the case of `QQbar` is that it is not found in the dictionary `D` in the code linked above. The following code demonstrates the difference in a cleaner example:

```python
# Over QQ:
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, ["t"])
S = PolynomialRing(QQ, ["t", "x"])
D = {S.gen(0): 1}
(R.gen(0) == S.gen(0), R.gen(0) in D, hash(R.gen(0)) == hash(S.gen(0))) # (True, True, True)

# Over QQbar
R = PolynomialRing(QQbar, ["t"])
S = PolynomialRing(QQbar, ["t", "x"])
D = {S.gen(0): 1}
(R.gen(0) == S.gen(0), R.gen(0) in D, hash(R.gen(0)) == hash(S.gen(0))) # (True, False, False)
```

The real reason seems to be that `hash` works differently depending on the base of the polynomial ring. If the base is `QQbar`, then `hash` does not respect the inclusion of `QQbar["t"]` in `QQbar["t", "x"]`, i.e. the `t` from the first and the second one have different hashes. 

For the univariate case over `QQbar`, the hash code (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/4541564cf151a5138810e9c2144349f59469d769/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx#L1207)) considers all monomials of the given polynomial, including the constant monomial `0`. The hash code in the multivariate case (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/4541564cf151a5138810e9c2144349f59469d769/src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx#L526)) only uses the non-zero terms in the monomial.

There is a even a comment in the code that this incorrectly assumes that `hash(0)` is zero, which is not true for `QQbar`.

Maybe there is already a ticket for this kind of behavior? I tried searching, but could not find anything.

Yes, this is what is described at the bottom of the ticket description. However, it is really hard to make all equal things (because of coercion) have equal hashes. In this case, we are probably better changing the test in some way, such as bringing things to common parents for comparison, to make the code more robust.
