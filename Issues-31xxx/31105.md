When specializing a polynomial `f` in a tower of polynomial rings to a special value using `f.specialization`, the parent of the returned polynomial is inconsistent.

Consider first the case when the base of the tower is `QQ`:

```
sage: K.<t> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x + t
sage: f1 = f.specialization({t: 1}); f1
x + 1
sage: f1.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

On the other hand, if the base of the tower is `QQbar`, the specialized polynomial remains a polynomial in `x` and `t`:

```
sage: K.<t> = QQbar[]
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x + t
sage: f1 = f.specialization({t: 1}); f1
x + 1
sage: f1.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Algebraic Field
```

Note that the value is substituted correctly, but unlike for `QQ` `f1`'s parent is `R` and not `QQbar["x"]` as I would expect.

I can see that this happens because a different `SpecializationMorphism` is constructed in the two cases. I believe the difference lies in line 547 of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/flatten.py` (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/flatten.py?h=9.2#n547)), where for `QQ` the list `new` is empty (when dealing with the ring `K`) while for `QQbar` the list `new` contains the variable `t`. This causes the tower to be reconstructed differently.

The reason that `t` is considered a new variable in the case of `QQbar` is that it is not found in the dictionary `D` in the code linked above. The following code demonstrates the difference in a cleaner example:

```python
# Over QQ:
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, ["t"])
S = PolynomialRing(QQ, ["t", "x"])
D = {S.gen(0): 1}
(R.gen(0) == S.gen(0), R.gen(0) in D, hash(R.gen(0)) == hash(S.gen(0))) # (True, True, True)

# Over QQbar
R = PolynomialRing(QQbar, ["t"])
S = PolynomialRing(QQbar, ["t", "x"])
D = {S.gen(0): 1}
(R.gen(0) == S.gen(0), R.gen(0) in D, hash(R.gen(0)) == hash(S.gen(0))) # (True, False, False)
```

The real reason seems to be that `hash` works differently depending on the base of the polynomial ring. If the base is `QQbar`, then `hash` does not respect the inclusion of `QQbar["t"]` in `QQbar["t", "x"]`, i.e. the `t` from the first and the second one have different hashes. 

For the univariate case over `QQbar`, the hash code (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/4541564cf151a5138810e9c2144349f59469d769/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx#L1207)) considers all monomials of the given polynomial, including the constant monomial `0`. The hash code in the multivariate case (see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/4541564cf151a5138810e9c2144349f59469d769/src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx#L526)) only uses the non-zero terms in the monomial.

There is a even a comment in the code that this incorrectly assumes that `hash(0)` is zero, which is not true for `QQbar`.

Maybe there is already a ticket for this kind of behavior? I tried searching, but could not find anything.
