https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath/ shows instructions that seem to come from `docker/README.md`. They need updating.


Original report:

According to this [answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50194/interact-in-jupyterlab-vs-jupyter/) on Ask [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath), starting from Sage 9.2 beta ll, we can jupyterlab using:


```
sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```
 

Running this command on [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 9.3.beta4 gives:


```
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```


Steps to reproduce:


```
docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:develop bash

sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y build-essential

sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```

This is not specific to `jupyterlab_widgets`. 

```
$ sage -i normaliz
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```
Whatever this docker image is prepared for, installing optional packages does not seem part of it.

```
$ ls -l sage
total 180
-rw-r--r-- 1 sage sage 66461 Dec 15 05:51 COPYING.txt

One notes that the top-level `Makefile` (and many other files) are missing. So no build operations are possible.

These are quite different. The former is a build from a released stable version of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) (latest=master) in a version that allows to rebuild [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath). The latter is a build from the latest beta but without such tooling, i.e., only with the very basics to run [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath).
