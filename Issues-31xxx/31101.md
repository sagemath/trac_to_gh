https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath/ shows instructions that seem to come from `docker/README.md`. They need updating.


Original report:

According to this [answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50194/interact-in-jupyterlab-vs-jupyter/) on Ask [SageMath](SageMath), starting from Sage 9.2 beta ll, we can jupyterlab using:


```
sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```
 

Running this command on [SageMath](SageMath) 9.3.beta4 gives:


```
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```


Steps to reproduce:


```
docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:develop bash

sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y build-essential

sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```
