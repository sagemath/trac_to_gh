Inspired by this [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55750/sagemath-92-product-function-bug/) on `ask.sagemath.org` :

```
    sage: var("q, jt")
    (q, jt)
    sage: A=q^(2/3)+q**(2/5)
    sage: B=product(1 -q**jt, jt, 1 , 31)*q**(1 /24 )
    sage: bool((A*B).expand()==(A*B.expand()).expand())
    False
    sage: (((A*B).expand())/(A*B.expand()).expand()).factor()
    2*q^(1/24)/(q^(17/24) + q^(53/120))
```

However :

```
    sage: bool(A*B==A*B.expand()) # Damn slow...
    True
    sage: ((A*B)/(A*B.expand())).factor()
    1
```

The iteration of expand should **not** change the value of the expanded quantity.

Severity set to `blocker` because this can give mathematically incorrect results on basic computations met in everyday situations.

There are two problems.

The first problem is that if a variable appears in a sum with two (or more) different fractional exponents, such as `x^(1/2) + x^(1/3)`, then pynac's `poly_mul_expand` function finds the gcd of the exponents (call it `d`), and introduces a new variable (call it `z`) to represent `x^d`. Then the original terms can be represented as integer powers of the new variable. In our example they are `z^3` and `z^2`. The first problem is that pynac calculates the gcd incorrectly if one of the exponents is `1`. I have opened ticket #31477 to fix this.

The other problem shows up when a variable arises with a fractional exponent, but also arises with no exponent at all, such as in `x^(1/2) + x^(1/3) + x`. In this case, `poly_mul_expand` erroneously substitutes `x^d` for the term that has no exponent (where `d` is the gcd that was calculated above). This is is clearly wrong, because `x` will almost never be equal to `x^d`.

The code should be rewritten so that a term with no exponent is treated as if it has `1` as an exponent. This will not be difficult, but it will require some refactoring to avoid excessive code duplication.

I have opened metaticket #31478 to track this and other problems with `poly_mul_expand`. Given that the code has these two bugs, plus the bug in #31077, I think it needs a thorough examination, instead of just patches for the bugs that we have noticed. Ticket #31479 disables the use of `poly_mul_expand`, so this is not an urgent problem.
