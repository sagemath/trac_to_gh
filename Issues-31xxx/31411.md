Inspired by this [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55750/sagemath-92-product-function-bug/) on `ask.sagemath.org` :

```
    sage: var("q, jt")
    (q, jt)
    sage: A=q^(2/3)+q**(2/5)
    sage: B=product(1 -q**jt, jt, 1 , 31)*q**(1 /24 )
    sage: bool((A*B).expand()==(A*B.expand()).expand())
    False
    sage: (((A*B).expand())/(A*B.expand()).expand()).factor()
    2*q^(1/24)/(q^(17/24) + q^(53/120))
```

However :

```
    sage: bool(A*B==A*B.expand()) # Damn slow...
    True
    sage: ((A*B)/(A*B.expand())).factor()
    1
```

The iteration of expand should **not** change the value of the expanded quantity.

Severity set to `blocker` because this can give mathematically incorrect results on basic computations met in everyday situations.
