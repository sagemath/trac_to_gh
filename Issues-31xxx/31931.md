We add `_sympy_` methods to various parent classes, returning sympy `Integers`, `Reals`, `Complexes`, `ProductSet`.

These methods override the generic `_sympy_` method provided by #31938.

Part of #31926 Meta-ticket: Connect Sage sets to sympy sets


Depends on #31938
Depends on #31877

Nice - if patchbot says yes this this seems to be good.  

Question: Do these reimport into Sage as one might expect (does the diagram commute in either direction)?  If so, some tests for that might be appropriate.

No, the other direction of conversion is not implemented yet, this would be part of #31935. The closest we have is `sage.interfaces.sympy.sympy_set_to_list`, which converts from various sympy set types to lists of Sage SR relation expressions.

It fails with an unpleasant error message because SymPy tries too hard to make sense of it. Example:

```
sage: F = FiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: cartesian_product([F, F])._sympy_()
SymPyDeprecationWarning: 

String fallback in sympify has been deprecated since SymPy 1.6. Use
sympify(str(obj)) or sympy.core.sympify.converter or obj._sympy_
instead. See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/18066 for more
info.

  SymPyDeprecationWarning(.....)

SyntaxError: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

SympifyError: Sympify of expression 'could not parse 'An example of a finite enumerated set: {1,2,3}'' failed, because of exception being raised:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
```

#31938 will provide all Sage sets with a `_sympy_` method.
