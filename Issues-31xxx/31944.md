Currently, attempting to use periodic points or preperiodic points to compute the scheme defining the minimal periodic or preperiodic points throws a Not Implemented error. We implement this functionality.

We also add a formal parameter to the periodic and preperiodic functions to facilitate the computation of the formal periodic or formal preperiodic points.

<a id='comment:7'></a>All my versions of sage are compiling, so this is a code review only without functionality testing. It looks like there will be issues with subschemes.

- formal and dimension 1 are missing the subscheme equations in X

- f_deformed: this is now defined over projective space rather than the subscheme. So the X you eventually get does not include the defining equations of the subscheme. 

- This line is perhaps worth a comment

```
Ideal = f_deformed.preperiodic_points(m, n, return_scheme=True).defining_ideal()
```
that minimal=True and Formal=False does in fact get the formal periodic points for the deformed map (since all (relevant) multiplicities are 1).

- Don't capitalize the variable Ideal


- The same comments about subscheme issues for periodic points version.


- 31906 is included by not listed as a dependency. This doesn't really seem to be a dependency.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I feel like I'm starting to repeat the same errors over and over again, so here is what I have so far.

- A non-minimal point appears

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2-z^2,y^2-21/16*z^2,z^2])
for Q in f.preperiodic_points(1,2,minimal=True,formal=False):
    print(Q, Q.is_preperiodic(f,return_period=True))
```

- line 4221: perhaps add the same comment as on 3897 as this looks redundant at first glance

```
R = f.base_ring()
```

- KeyError

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-1*y^2,y^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,formal=True)
```

- This is wrong:

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-3/4*y^2,y^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=True,formal=False,return_scheme=True)
```

Also wrong

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2+3/4*y^2,y^2,z^2],X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=True,formal=False,return_scheme=True).rational_points()
```

Also wrong:

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(GF(3),2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=True,formal=False,return_scheme=True).rational_points()
```

- TypeError

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(GF(3),2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],X)
F.periodic_points(1,minimal=True,formal=True,return_scheme=True).rational_points()
```

- This gives a TypeError, perhaps catch the good fields and give a more informative error message

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(RR,2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=True,formal=False,return_scheme=True).rational_points()
```

- Shouldn't this work?

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=True,formal=False,return_scheme=True)
```

- Why is there no 'c' in this?

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-c*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=X)
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=False,formal=False,return_scheme=True)
```

But there is here

```
R.<c>=QQ[]
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),2)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-c*y^2,y^2,z^2])
F.periodic_points(2,minimal=False,formal=False,return_scheme=True)
```

Function fields aren't implemented, as I don't think there is a flatening morphism for function fields. I added a nice error message.

<a id='comment:14'></a>You fixed most of the subscheme issues, but my first three comments are unaddressed.

Some additional comments on the new code:

- add `domain=PS` to be clear line 3906

```
f = DynamicalSystem(f.defining_polynomials())
```

- I don't understand why dom.defining_polynomials() is on this (3911-3912)

```
if formal and N == 2 and dom == PS:
    X = PS.subscheme([f.dynatomic_polynomial([m,n])] + list(dom.defining_polynomials()))
```

- Why are you using

```
list(X.defining_ideal().gens()
```
rather than

```
list(X.defining_polynomials())
```

<a id='comment:20'></a>Minimal seems to be broken for preperiodic points:

```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 - y^2, 2*(x^2 - y^2), y^2 - z^2])
K = f.preperiodic_points(1, 1, minimal=True, return_scheme=True)
K(P(0,0,1))
(0: 0: 1)
```

But (0:0:1) is a periodic point of period 1 (so it shouldn't be minimal of preperiod (1,1), right?). I'm not sure how to fix this, since

```
K2 = f.preperiodic_points(0, 1, minimal=False, return_scheme=True)
ideal = K.defining_ideal()
ideal2 = K2.defining_ideal()
ideal.saturation(ideal2)[0] == ideal
True
```

Saturation of ideals isn't removing the periodic point.

<a id='comment:29'></a>The non-morphism check is missed in this case

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-y^2,z^2-y^2,x^2-z^2])
F.preperiodic_points(0,2,minimal=False,formal=True,return_scheme=True)
```

Also, found another weird case giving back the wrong answers

Here are the periods. It's not necessarily wrong that there are lower periods as there are many high multiplicity points here.

```
K=QQ
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=P)
for Q in F.preperiodic_points(2,1,minimal=False,formal=True,return_scheme=False):
    print(Q,F._is_preperiodic(Q,return_period=True))
```

Checking the multiplicities, we see that nothing is being subtracted out despite there being (1,1) points.

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=P)
for Q in F.preperiodic_points(2,1,minimal=False,formal=True,return_scheme=True).rational_points():
    print(Q,Q.multiplicity())


P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=P)
for Q in F.preperiodic_points(2,1,minimal=False,formal=False,return_scheme=True).rational_points():
    print(Q,Q.multiplicity())

P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
F=DynamicalSystem([x^2-2*y^2,y^2,z^2],domain=P)
for Q in F.preperiodic_points(1,1,minimal=False,formal=False,return_scheme=True).rational_points():
    print(Q,Q.multiplicity())
```


- Perhaps there is just something weird when minimal=False and formal=True?

I updated the logic around minimal and formal, adding a check for if (m,n) != (0,1). But, I coded it as m != 0 and n != 1, so minimal and formal were being ignored when n = 1 or when m = 0.

Changed to m != 0 or n != 1.

I think the example you gave should work now, however, it hasn't finished running yet. It may never will, since it is actually doing the computations to find the formal scheme now
