The algorithm for the longest_increasing_subsequences function for permutations is currently very inefficient. I worked on a new version that vastly improves the run time of the function. 
New version:

```
sage: %timeit Permutations(30).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences()                                     
19.6 ms ± 2.28 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

Old version:

```
sage: %timeit Permutations(30).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences()                                     
The slowest run took 10.40 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
3min 34s ± 2min 47s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

follow-up: #34218

<a id='comment:6'></a>I think `seq == sorted(seq)` would be better replaced by

```
all(seq[i] <= seq[i+1] for i in range(len(seq)-1))
```

Also, is there a way you can avoid all of the calls to `index` here:

```
self.index(seq[j]) < self.index(seq[j+1]):
```
I feel like there should be a better way to track things, otherwise this could run in `O(len(seq)^2)` (maybe `O(log(len(seq)*len(seq))`) time.

You can remove this useless list

```diff
-        potential_sequences = list(itertools.product(*s))
-        for seq in potential_sequences:
+        for seq in itertools.product(*s):
```

I think it is cleaner to write `j += 1` instead of `j = j+1`. It might also be marginally faster.

<a id='comment:14'></a>There's a clever Python way to check if one sequence is a subsequence of another with a single pass ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24017363/how-to-test-if-one-string-is-a-subsequence-of-another ):

```
def is_subseq(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)
```

Short enough that you could eliminate the helper function and go with

```
it = iter(self)
if seq == sorted(seq) and all(c in it for c in seq):
```

though including the helper function with the name may make code more transparent.

Were there any other lingering concerns besides fixing that helper function? If no other concerns and no preference between in-line vs helper function, I'll pick one, push the change and set to 'needs review'.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Peter decided to leave the project. I took his ideas as well as some ideas from Finn Hulse, another student I had in my class, to write the patch that should solve the problem. Instead of listing all potential longest increasing subsequences and checking for their presence in the sequence, it uses a directed graph in which all the paths from a source vertex to a sink are longest increasing subsequences.

As for speeding up the solution, I get the following results:

```
sage: %timeit Permutations(30).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences()
416 µs ± 6.73 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
sage: %timeit Permutations(100).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences()
3.34 ms ± 291 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

In comparison, with the code currently in Sage 9.7.beta5, I get

```
sage: %timeit Permutations(30).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences()
The slowest run took 34.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
6min 27s ± 6min 38s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

<a id='comment:28'></a>You can maintain the elements in a column sorted using

```
sage: from bisect import insort
sage: L = []
sage: for e in Permutations(30).random_element():
....:     insort(L, e)
sage: print(L)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
```

You can also avoid the call to method `self.longest_increasing_subsequence_length` and ensure that both `use `first_row_p_tableau` and `columns[j]` are sorted. Overall this is faster than your current code.

```
def longest_increasing_subsequences(self):

    """
    n = self.size()
    if not n:
        return([[]])

    from bisect import insort

    # getting the column in which each element is inserted
    first_row_p_tableau = []
    columns = []
    D = DiGraph(n+2)
    for x in self:
        j = bisect(first_row_p_tableau, x)
        if j == len(first_row_p_tableau):

            first_row_p_tableau[j] = x
            insort(columns[j], x)
            if j:
