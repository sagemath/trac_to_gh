Instead of just trusting that the output of a polyhedral algorithm (e.g., polyhedral representation conversion) is correct, we make them verifiable. 
- The verification should be written in plain Python and should be as elementary as possible. For example - for LP, `InteractiveLPProblem` fits the bill - it implements textbook simplex method 
- All transformations should be done by explicit maps


Algorithms:
- Certified polyhedral representation conversion: In the non-degenerate, bounded case, compute vertex/facet incidence; then verify for each vertex that the set of adjacent bases is correct. (When degeneracy is present, additional info may need to be computed in order to enable verification.)

- #31800 `CombinatorialPolyhedron` indexed by non-minimal H-representations

- #31799 From `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and `H-representation` to `Polyhedron` (with double description)

- Certified LP: #18735

- Certified polyhedral subdivisions and triangulations

Applications:

- #30202 Chamber of a parametric polyhedron


References
- TBD
