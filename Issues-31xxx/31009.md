python3 does not seem to depend at all on `libpng`, so we should remove it from the declared dependencies (and the `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`).

This will allow us to accept system python 3.6 on `centos-7` (see #29033), as can be seen by using

```
  tox -e docker-centos-7-standard -- config.status
```
and probably also on `conda-forge-ubuntu-minimal` (where currently the `python3` build fails, even after the upgrade to 3.9.1 in #30589, https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1566872755).
