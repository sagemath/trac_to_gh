```
In Sage 9.3.rc0, this works:

```
sage: p = 127
sage: K.<t> = GF(p^2, modulus=x^2 + 1)
sage: type(K)
<class
'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>
sage: a = 3*t + 2
sage: a.integer_representation()
383
sage: 3*p + 2
383
```
but this does not:

```
sage: p = 367
sage: K.<t> = GF(p^2, modulus=x^2 + 1)
sage: type(K)
<class
'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_pari_ffelt.FiniteField_pari_ffelt_with_category'>
sage: a = 3*t + 2
sage: a.integer_representation()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError:
'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_pari_ffelt.FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt'
object has no attribute 'integer_representation'
```
Expected (`3 * 367 + 2`):

```
1103
```

Additionally, the method should return a Sage integer
rather than a Python integer as the existing implementation
for Givaro finite field elements currently does.

This seems to be a duplicate of #8578 (except that the name of the method seems to have been `int_repr` back then), so I think one of the two should be closed.

There is a bit of discussion of this issue in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/9B1ZQoHoQ9k/m/IocBbsKjlEcJ).

Thanks for spotting that. I agree one of the tickets should
be closed as duplicate. I don't mind which. Maybe it's less
trouble to close the older one given the method changed name
in the meantime.
