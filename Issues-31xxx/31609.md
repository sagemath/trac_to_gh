Currently, constructing a tangent vector *v* at some point *p* of a manifold *M* requires two steps: first construct the tangent space at *p*, T<sub>*p*</sub>*M*, and then construct *v* as an element of T<sub>*p*</sub>*M*. For instance:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: p = E((1, 2), name='p')
sage: Tp = E.tangent_space(p)   # step 1
sage: v = Tp((-1, 3)); v        # step 2
Vector at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2
```
This ticket endows the class `DifferentiableManifold` with a method `tangent_vector`, with `vector` as an alias,  to make it a 1-step process. We can now write:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: p = E((1, 2), name='p')
sage: v = E.vector(p, -1, 3); v
Vector at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2
```
This feature is motivated by this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56483/).

OK, this is done in the last commit.
Note however that saying simply "vector at point p of manifold M" is quite unambiguous and is in line with the terminology "vector field": we do not say "tangent vector field", do we?  

> This is a neat feature though, and I don't want to block it just because of my pedantry. An alias sounds like a good compromise.


Done. `vector` is now an alias for `tangent_vector`.

I oppose to this: we shall not introduce on Euclidean spaces method names that break for more general manifolds, while the functionality is exactly the same.

How about requiring

```
v = E.vector(p, (-1, 3))
```
instead of

```
v = E.vector(p, -1, 3)
```
I don't mind either way but there's a choice to make.

No, we don't say "tangent vector field". But I haven't heard or read the use of "vector" over "tangent vector" either. Historical burden I suppose.

It should be unambiguous though and having both is fine with me. Someone who seeks for (tangent) vectors will find them now.
