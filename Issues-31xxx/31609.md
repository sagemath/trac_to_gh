Currently, constructing a tangent vector *v* at some point *p* of a manifold *M* requires two steps: first construct the tangent space at *p*, T<sub>*p*</sub>*M*, and then construct *v* as an element of T<sub>*p*</sub>*M*. For instance:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: p = E((1, 2), name='p')
sage: Tp = E.tangent_space(p)   # step 1
sage: v = Tp((-1, 3)); v        # step 2
Vector at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2
```
This ticket endows the class `DifferentiableManifold` with a method `tangent_vector`, with `vector` as an alias,  to make it a 1-step process. We can now write:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: p = E((1, 2), name='p')
sage: v = E.vector(p, -1, 3); v
Vector at Point p on the Euclidean plane E^2
```
This feature is motivated by this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/56483/).

`vector` is more adapted to elementary use, like in vector calculus in the Euclidean space, when the user might not know what "tangent space" means. Of course, we can make an alias for `tangent_vector` if you feel it necessary.

OK, this is done in the last commit.
Note however that saying simply "vector at point p of manifold M" is quite unambiguous and is in line with the terminology "vector field": we do not say "tangent vector field", do we?

Done. `vector` is now an alias for `tangent_vector`.

How about requiring

```
v = E.vector(p, (-1, 3))
```
instead of

```
v = E.vector(p, -1, 3)
```
I don't mind either way but there's a choice to make.

There is no choice to make ;-) Both work in the current implementation (cf. the examples in the doctests).

No, we don't say "tangent vector field". But I haven't heard or read the use of "vector" over "tangent vector" either. Historical burden I suppose.

It should be unambiguous though and having both is fine with me. Someone who seeks for (tangent) vectors will find them now.
