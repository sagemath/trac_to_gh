The following code evaluated in Sage 9.2 leads to a segmentation fault

```
sin(4*arctan(1/(sqrt(3) + 2))-x).taylor(x, 0, 1)
```

The error message is

```
;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also known as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;
```

Changing the constant slightly gives the desired result, e.g.

```
sin(4*arctan(1/(sqrt(3) + 1))-x).taylor(x, 0, 1)
```

evaluates to 

```
-x*cos(4*arctan(1/2*sqrt(3) - 1/2)) + sin(4*arctan(1/2*sqrt(3) - 1/2))
```

Upstream report:

- [Maxima bug 3716](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3716/)

**Keywords:** maxima, taylor series

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. No feedback yet.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This is a maxima bug:

```
(%i1) taylor(sin(atan(1/(sqrt(3) + 2)) - x), x, 0, 1);

      Message from maxima's stderr stream: INFO: Control stack guard page unprotected
      Control stack guard page temporarily disabled: proceed with caution
      Control stack guard page temporarily disabled: proceed with caution
      Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
       Control stack exhausted (no more space for function call frames).
      This is probably due to heavily nested or infinitely recursive function
      calls, or a tail call that SBCL cannot or has not optimized away.
```
I tested with some other nonzero integers `a` and `b` in the place of `3` and `2`. It seems that the crash happens whenever `a < b^2` (including all cases where `a < 0`).

This seems to be the case, except if `a` is a square number. I guess the `sqrt` is evaluated first in that case. This implies that the `sqrt` is somehow involved in triggering the bug.

I will file a bug report on the maxima bug tracker. Should I close the ticket here?

PS If you need a workaround for the bug, you can replace `2` with a variable, and then substitute at the end:

```
sage: var('a');
sage: sin(4*arctan(1/(sqrt(3) + a))-x).taylor(x, 0, 1).subs(a=2)
-x*cos(4*arctan(1/(sqrt(3) + 2))) + sin(4*arctan(1/(sqrt(3) + 2)))
