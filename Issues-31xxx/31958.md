SymPy has a clean and general design for assumptions.
https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/assumptions/index.html

- https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/assumptions/assume.html?highlight=assumptionscontext#sympy.assumptions.assume.AssumptionsContext

We should connect to it. Based on #31926 (#24171, #31931, #31938), we should be able to express everything in it that Sage's assumptions can do, so perhaps we can replace what we have in Sage completely by SymPy.

Tickets:
- #30075 Refactor assumptions (move maxima-specific things to maxima interface)


Symptoms:
- #27998 Solving a single equation for multiple variables doesn't work with assumptions
- #29938 comparison with infinity does not take assumptions into account
- #25972 solve does not obey assumptions for inequalities
- #24334 sympy symbol -> `SR` drops assumptions
- #30793 Sage may ignore the imaginary part of variables not explicitly declared complex

One issue with using sympy for the implementation is that loading it would add quite a bit to the start up time:

```
$ time ./sage -c quit

real	0m1.620s
user	0m1.249s
sys	0m0.450s
$ time ./sage -c "import sympy"

real	0m1.980s
user	0m1.570s
sys	0m0.514s
