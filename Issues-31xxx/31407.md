`cp` is not the actual error. The problem is before `[pplpy-0.8.6] ValueError: source code string cannot contain null bytes`. I believe that the post-install script is not aborted if compilation fails. Since the documentation was not created `build/html/*'` the `cp` fails.

So one thing is to solve "abort on failure" and the other thing is to fix the issue.
