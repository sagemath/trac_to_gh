Currently, the comparison is implemented only for two objects of the same type (vertex/ray/line or inequality/equation), as follows

```
if type(self) != type(other):
    return NotImplemented
return richcmp(self._vector*self._comparison_scalar(), other._vector*other._comparison_scalar(), op)
```

It might be good to extend the comparison to objects of different types, using the numeric values for the output of the type() method: 
`INEQUALITY = 0`; `EQUATION = 1`; `VERTEX = 2`; `RAY = 3`; `LINE = 4`.
That is, instead of `return NotImplemented`, we return something like

```
richcmp((self.type(), self._vector*self._comparison_scalar()), (other.type(), other._vector*other._comparison_scalar()), op)
```

In this way, we will be able to sort a list of polyhedra according to their Vrepresentations.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0),(1,1)])                                       
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0)], rays=[(1,1)])                               
sage: sorted([Q, P], key=lambda p: p.Vrepresentation())                               
Traceback (most recent call 
...
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Ray' and 'Vertex'
```

As long as you don't break #30954, it should be fine.

It is somehow inherited from vectors, which does lexicographic comparison. Indeed you can make this comparison consistent by using rich comparison on the types, if the types differ. I don't need it, but I don't mind it either.

I would consider it to be bad practice to rely on an `NotImplementedError`, because it is somehow a deprecation message by itself implicitly telling you "this might change in the future".

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

The wording "Check :trac:`31702`" suggests that this is a test for a bug -- but this ticket adds a feature, rather than fixing a bug.

It would be better to reword it so that it becomes part of the documentation of the sorting order. There is no need to refer to a ticket number for non-bugfix tickets.
