Over a third of the distribution archive
 sage-9.2-Ubuntu_20.04-x86_64.tar.bz2
is occupied by the build directory
 SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/


```
$ du -sh SageMath
13G	SageMath

$ du -sh SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/
4.8G	SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/
```

Perhaps a clean command got lost from one of the packaging scripts?

Note however that the "relocate-once.py" script needs at least some of what's in `build`.  If you delete `build` before the first run of sage, one gets:

```
nmd2 ~/SageMath $ ./sage

Rewriting paths for your new installation directory

This might take a few minutes but only has to be done once.

Likewise in the Sage 9.4 binaries (except the build directory has moved to the new location `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/`).

At least `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/temp.*` should be removed (which is not needed for fast rebuilds). See related discussion in #33103.

Also (less importantly, because tiny)
- `pkgs/sage-docbuild/build` 


What is shipped in the binary distribution appears to be defined outside of the Sage source tree, in https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage.yaml#L35, not by any of the elaborate `...-clean` targets in our `Makefile`.
