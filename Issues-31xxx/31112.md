Some while-we-are-at-it things (although feel free to say too much for a ticket):

- `.. note::` -> `.. NOTE::`
- Rename the `dict` variables.
- Remove the `:math:` tags.
- Avoid the `*.all` imports (this helps avoid circular imports).
- Lowercase error messages, e.g., `raise ValueError("There are...`.

Thanks, Travis.

All done, and more, in the second commit.

But there is a failure in the `TestSuite` now, and I do not understand why.

I don't have the error in front of me, but since you added `UniqueRepresentation` to `EtaGroup_class`, it should not have a `__reduce__` method. (Also, it is better to put the UR first in the MRO.)

Also, instead of `EtaGroupElement` in the `__call__` (which likely should become `_element_constructor_`), you should use `self.element_class`.

I don't understand the purpose of the `EtaProduct` function. Likewise, the corresponding arithmetic functions should just be replaced by `self.parent().element_class(self.parent(), data)`.

Last, why the change to the more generic class:

```diff
-class EtaGroupElement(MultiplicativeGroupElement):
+class EtaGroupElement(Element):
```
I am fine with it, but I was wondering if you had a reason for the change.

I do not understand exactly what you say. Maybe one could keep further refactoring for later ?

Well, this seems to be duplicated information, as we have fixed the category for the parent now. And `MultiplicativeGroupElement` looks like something from an old Element hierarchy system, which is more or less obsolete, no ?

I made these changes because it is necessary to have the elements returned being the correct class. However, I created #31121 for some additional changes I wanted to make while looking at the file.
