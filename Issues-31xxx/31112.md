- Remove the `:math:` tags.
- Avoid the `*.all` imports (this helps avoid circular imports).
- Lowercase error messages, e.g., `raise ValueError("There are...`.

Thanks, Travis.

All done, and more, in the second commit.

But there is a failure in the `TestSuite` now, and I do not understand why.

I don't have the error in front of me, but since you added `UniqueRepresentation` to `EtaGroup_class`, it should not have a `__reduce__` method. (Also, it is better to put the UR first in the MRO.)

Also, instead of `EtaGroupElement` in the `__call__` (which likely should become `_element_constructor_`), you should use `self.element_class`.

I don't understand the purpose of the `EtaProduct` function. Likewise, the corresponding arithmetic functions should just be replaced by `self.parent().element_class(self.parent(), data)`.

Last, why the change to the more generic class:

```diff
-class EtaGroupElement(MultiplicativeGroupElement):
+class EtaGroupElement(Element):
```
I am fine with it, but I was wondering if you had a reason for the change.

I do not understand exactly what you say. Maybe one could keep further refactoring for later ?

True, there is nothing really added there.

If my additional changes are good, then positive review. Tests in the folder pass for me.
