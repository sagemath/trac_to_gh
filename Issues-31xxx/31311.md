is in contradiction to the warning just before it. If you could normalize the elements, you would have a solution to the word problem. However, the comment suggests that it is possible to do such a normalization.

I would recommend tightening up your explanation of the hash and `==` being inconsistent. In particular, I would just give two elements that are equal and then their hashes being unequal. The "2" element set example is also good. Your conclusion, as stated on #31203, that the multiplication table fails because of this is incorrect.

I don't necessarily agree with an explicit recommendation to convert to a permutation group as that only applies when the group is finite. If something is to be written, which I am not sure I think it should be, then I would instead state that instead of a `set` or `dict`, one needs to use a `list`.

How about this:

```
.. WARNING::

    Even if Sage can recognize that the group is finite, it does not
    completely "normalize" elements
    of finitely generated groups.
    Thus, trying to put such group elements into a set or to use them
    as keys for a dictionary may lead to trouble.
```


>

> 

The multiplication table seems to be fixed, so that remark is obsolete.

> I don't necessarily agree with an explicit recommendation to convert to a permutation group as that only applies when the group is finite. If something is to be written, which I am not sure I think it should be, then I would instead state that instead of a `set` or `dict`, one needs to use a `list`.

But a list is not a replacement for a set or dict, if a set or dict is what I need.
Yes indeed, the recommendation should be conditional on finiteness.

Maybe it should even be explicitly highlighted that elements of the permutation group can be converted back to the free group? This is very useful. Is it already written somewhere?

This is better, but I don't really care for it too much. I guess with a confluent rewriting system, you can definite a normalization of an element. However, the finiteness of the group is not the deciding factor, it is that Sage can sometimes recognize when two elements are equal, even in an infinite group:

```
sage: F.<a,b,c> = FreeGroup() 
sage: G = F / [a^2,b^2,c^2,a*b*c*a*b*c] 
sage: G(a*b*c*a*b*c) == G.one()                                                                                   
True
```
So I would rather see something like

```
.. WARNING::

    Sage can sometimes recognize when two words represent the same
    element in a finitely presented group. However, there is typically
    no way to canonically represent the elements. Thus, the hash
    functions of two elements ``a`` and ``b`` may not be equal even
    though ``a == b``. Therefore, there could be issues with the
    elements being used in a `set` or keys of a `dict`.

They can be used to replace them, but you do loose (a lot of) speed. Now that it explicitly says finite groups to use permutation groups, I am happier with it. Since you want to include this (again, I don't think this is necessary), you should also include something to cover infinite groups and state that they can still be used in lists.

> Maybe it should even be explicitly highlighted that elements of the permutation group can be converted back to the free group? This is very useful. Is it already written somewhere?

That would be something for the permutation group or free group code, not the FPG code.

I think this is an obvious mathematical fact:

```
+Beware that this conversion to the free group ``F`` is
+not a one-to-one operation::
```
So I don't see the point in including those tests. (It is possible that the FPG is a free group too.)

Also, please undo this change:

```diff
-"""
-Finitely Presented Groups
+"""Finitely Presented Groups
```
Sage's convention is to start on the next line after a `"""`.

A typo here `regognizes` -> `recognizes`.

But the previous example, which was there before, performs such a conversion (I only changed the group because otherwise the test `==G.one()` took too long):

```
sage: F(rst_G) == r*s/t
True
```

So what IS the conversion to F? What is this example trying to show? Is the result `True` merely a coincidence?

Or are elements of finitely generated groups internally represented as elements of the corresponding free groups? And F(..) merely brings out this representation.

There is no coercion from F -> G, so the equality cannot be computed:

```
sage: rr * r
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Finitely presented group < r, s, t | r^2, s^3, t^3, r*s*t >' and 'Free Group on generators {r, s, t}'
```
I think there should be a coercion from the free group down to the quotient, but that is a separate issue.

The conversion to `F` is just treat it like an element in the free group with that word. This example is showing that is what actually happens, that we can make the round trip (as conversions), and that the elements are treated as completely different objects. This is different than showing the conversion is not injective.

> Or are elements of finitely generated groups internally represented as elements of the corresponding free groups? And F(..) merely brings out this representation.

Kind of. I would say `F(...)` changes the meaning of that representation; that the word is not in the FPG but the ambient free group.

Ah. Same hash is only a necessary condition for being regarded as equal
in a set. Of course, a `==` test is always performed when there is a hash collision.

Most of these are all fairly simple things to implement IMO (and some are already there by default). While there is a code smell from this, there is a mathematical block that cannot be worked around. There is no such thing as a free lunch, but there are multiple kinds of workarounds depending on the use-case.

You are missing the points about `==` and a `list` working as a container object. The point is you can hold a set of objects and check if another element already belongs to it.

I think it is bad practice to talk about the internal implementations in documentation unless it very explicitly is necessary. Here, that is not the case. Instead, it is a manifestation of the fact there is no canonical way to normalize elements. So it is good point out that they may look the same and we can convert back to the free group (which doesn't have to depend on the internal representation of the element), they are otherwise different objects.

I agree that talking about internals should be avoided, but I don't agree that the result does not depend on the internal representation.

The conversion from "G" to "F" (referring to the current example) exists in Sage. It is mentioned in one of the examples that are already in the documentation. It is indeed a  triviality that it cannot be a uniquely defined operation in the mathematical sense, but then: What **IS** this conversion?

I think it should be **specified** what F(x) is when x is an element of G, more precisely than saying "convert from one parent to the other". Can this be done without talking about the representation?

I am inclined to reinsert the example of F(..) not being one-to-one. Sage *does* provide this conversion even though it
is mathematically unsound (in the sense that the result depends on the internal representation), and the user should
be warned.

(BTW, already the current doc talks about the representation: "Notice that, even if they are represented in the same way". In some earlier attempt at "improving" the documentation, I changed "represented" to "displayed", precisely for the reason to avoid talking about the internal representation.

Hashing is not an (internal) implementation detail but a feature and an important aspect of the code (as your example explicitly points out).

So in `<t|t^2>`, the elements `t^2` and `1` are distinct but equal. Also another subtle point is the difference between the *internal* representation and that instances of elements of a FPG are representatives of some element in the FPG.

It is indeed a  triviality that it cannot be a uniquely defined operation in the mathematical sense, but then: What **IS** this conversion?\n\nPerhaps a more formal perspective will help sort this out. We have a set of all words `G` in an (finite) alphabet `A` representing the generators of a free group. A FPG is `G` along with an equivalence relation `==`. Thus the conversion is the natural map from `G -> F` that simply forgets about the equivalence relation.\n\n> I think it should be **specified** what F(x) is when x is an element of G, more precisely than saying \"convert from one parent to the other\". Can this be done without talking about the representation?\n\nOf course, we really want to think of `G` as the quotient, elements up to the equivalence relation. However, we cannot implement it in that way in general. We could rework the implementation for finite groups, but I might be slightly worried about efficiency.\n\n> I am inclined to reinsert the example of F(..) not being one-to-one.

Instead, it is a manifestation of the fact there is no canonical way to normalize elements. So it is good point out that they may look the same and we can convert back to the free group (which doesn't have to depend on the internal representation of the element), they are otherwise different objects.

There is a difference between mathematical equality (`==`) and identity (Python `is`). So in `<t|t^2>`, the elements `t^2` and `1` are distinct but equal. Also another subtle point is the difference between the *internal* representation and that instances of elements of a FPG are representatives of some element in the FPG. See also the next paragraph.

It is indeed a  triviality that it cannot be a uniquely defined operation in the mathematical sense, but then: What **IS** this conversion?

Perhaps a more formal perspective will help sort this out. We have a set of all words `G` in an (finite) alphabet `A` representing the generators of a free group. A FPG is `G` along with an equivalence relation `==`. Thus the conversion is the natural map from `G -> F` that simply forgets about the equivalence relation.

> I think it should be **specified** what F(x) is when x is an element of G, more precisely than saying "convert from one parent to the other". Can this be done without talking about the representation?

Of course, we really want to think of `G` as the quotient, elements up to the equivalence relation. However, we cannot implement it in that way in general. We could rework the implementation for finite groups, but I might be slightly worried about efficiency.

It does not depend on the *internal* representation, but on the element, which is some word that represents some element in the FPG. Internally we could store the element as a list, a free group element, a `Sequence`, an integer, etc., but that doesn't change that it is a word representing some element in a FPG.

> (BTW, already the current doc talks about the representation: "Notice that, even if they are represented in the same way". In some earlier attempt at "improving" the documentation, I changed "represented" to "displayed", precisely for the reason to avoid talking about the internal representation.

I think that actually gets a bit further from the model that is implemented.

This is yet another, completely different story:

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(1)                                                         
sage: F([1])==F([1])                                                            
True
sage: F([1]) is F([1])                                                          
False
```

The Python "`is`" comparison is an object-oriented programming-language thing, and nobody expects mathematically meaningful properties from it. That is why Python allows to redefine `__equals__` (or `==`).

1.) I am not at all proposing to change the implementation. I am proposing to bring the documentation in line with what Sage does.


2.) There are several levels of implementation details. a) An element may be represented as a word, and b) a word may be internally represented as a tuple or list or whatever.

The lower level is indeed irrelevant for the specification, but the first level is important, in this case.

3.) Maybe to some people it is obvious that the elements of an FPG **are** words over the generators (modulo the trivial reductions a<sup>i</sup>*a<sup>j</sup>=a<sup>i+j</sup> and a<sup>0</sup>=1), and the relations are something extra. To other people,  elements of the group **are** equivalence classes of words.

The `==` test brings out the second interpretation.

Such different interpretations might cause people to fall into a trap (like me or the original implementors of the `multiplication_table` function), and therefore I find it important to address this in the documentation.

I will try to find some formulations.
