```
We fix code style to address code style reports by
pycodestyle, for warnings and error codes:

```
E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)
E702 multiple statements on one line (semicolon)
W605 invalid escape sequence '\Z'
```

See:

- https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

This makes `tox -e pycodestyle-minimal` pass
with the current configuration.

As this touches many files, we split this into
several smaller tickets.
