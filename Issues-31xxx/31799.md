Given an (abstract) `CombinatorialPolyhedron` such that **at least one** of H-representation and V-representation are labeled geometrically, the new method `CombinatorialPolyhedron.as_polyhedron` constructs a geometric polyhedron.

If `check=True` (default), it checks that the result is OK.

We should be able to efficiently build a polyhedron, avoiding to run the double description method when setting up the polyhedron, for the backends that accept double description input:
- if both representations are geometric, just pass them to the polyhedron constructor (#26366)
- if only one representation is geometric, reconstruct the other one from the incidences by equation solving.

Ideally, an optional argument `allow_degeneration` would allow that the given representation data actually gives a degeneration of the given combinatorial polyhedron.

In the context of #31803, this would be a morphism.

Depends on #31823
Depends on #26366

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

It only seems to make sense for those backends that allow initialization from both V-representation and H-representation.

(Normaliz somehow allows precomputed data, but it appears that initializing from precomputed data isn't really an advantage in terms of computation time.)

The method `a_maximal_chain` can be generalized to allow this. Currently it only gives some maximal chain, but we can easily obtain a maximal chain for each facet. This allows computing a unique inequality for each facet (in the non-degenerate case), given the V-representation. `a_maximal_chain` also allows obtaining the equations.

Given the H-representation we might as well be lazy and just use `CombinatorialPolyhedron.polar` for this.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by `allow_degeneration`. This is what I think for the case that the V-representation is given:
- let `d` be the dimension of the affine hull of the V-representation, either `d=0` or for each facet, the corresponding V-representation objects must have affine hull dimension less than `d`
- if `allow_degeneration=False` than `d` must be the dimension of the `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and the objects corresponding to the facets must have affine hull dimension `d-1` and those affine hulls must be unique for each facet
- a maximal chain corresponding to a `d-1` dimensional affine hull defines a unique inequality, those inequalities are the computed H-representation
- if `allow_degeneration=True` the remaining facets must have degenerated to a subset of some proper facet
- the slack matrix (of the given V-representation and the computed H-representation) must always be non-negative
- if `allow_degeneration=False` the incidence matrix (of the given V-representation and the computed H-representation) must be the same as the incidence matrix of the combinatorial polyhedron

It all depends on how much degeneration we allow. Another approach is that `allow_degeneration=True` only allows facets to collaps. So for any face of the combinatorial polyhedron the affine hull dimension of the given V-representation must be as expected.

Let's consider the generalized permutahedron as a model. I would like to include its degenerations in full generality.

A related question is how to do recognize degenerations on the level of abstract combinatorial polyhedra (without coordinates). Given two (abstract) combinatorial polyhedra P, Q and a map sending vertices to vertices, can we detect whether Q is a degeneration of P? I don't know how to check this without coordinates.

Ah, ok. From my intuition (which might be wrong as well), the following happens at a degeneration map:
- There exists a list of disjoint faces, which get contracted (so only one vertex remains for each of those faces).
- First step is to contract the vertices according to the map and apply a bitwise OR to the (old) coatom incidences.
- The new coatoms are the inclusion maximal coatoms.
- Each old coatom should still define a face (I think this holds automatically).

What needs to be checked:
- Whether each equivalence class of vertices corresponds to a face (compute the join of those atoms).

If this is correct, this ticket should depend on #29683.

We also need to check that the incidence matrix is correct then, which is quite obvious of course (probably best to check this via the bipartite digraph isomorphism of the vertex-facet graph).

Do we allow degenerations that might be obtained by iteratively degenerating? Might be a bit harder to check.
