It would be nice to allow forgetful functors for manifolds. In particular:

- differentiable manifolds -> topological manifolds
- (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds -> differentiable manifolds (not a category yet)
- topological manifolds -> sets (?)

and probably even more. The last point, if getting to work somehow, might also be useful and/or should be seen in view of #30832.

At the moment, we have the following behavior (which could be seen as a bug):

```
sage: from sage.categories.functor import ForgetfulFunctor
sage: from sage.categories.manifolds import Manifolds
sage: F = ForgetfulFunctor(Manifolds(RR).Differentiable(), Manifolds(RR).Topological())
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: F(M)
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

Something you could do is implement the corresponding `_call_` in the appropriate subcategories of `Manifolds` to handle the corresponding transferring of data. Although this probably would be a lot easier once there is a way to copy manifolds and reconstruct them, which I still need to do as part of the pickling fix... There is just a lot of data that needs to be carefully preserved and constructed ideally using the construction methods already in place. That is where bugs will likely occur.

> Something you could do is implement the corresponding `_call_` in the appropriate subcategories of `Manifolds` to handle the corresponding transferring of data. Although this probably would be a lot easier once there is a way to copy manifolds and reconstruct them, which I still need to do as part of the pickling fix... There is just a lot of data that needs to be carefully preserved and constructed ideally using the construction methods already in place. That is where bugs will likely occur. There are many ways to implement this that have various pros and cons, you just need to decide on which one you want.


Foremost charts, transition maps and their domains need to be copied since they encode the manifold's topology. I don't think that more data are necessary, except for the name and the dimension.

Is there a ticket devoted to pickling of manifolds yet?

See above. It is mathematically wrong to not obtain a differentiable manifold from the forgetful functor if you want differentiable manifolds to be a subcategory of topological manifolds. I don't see how the category of differentiable manifolds is not a subcategory of topological manifolds (in the mathematical sense of a subcategory). If you want to call this the forgetful functor, you need to prove to me that the maximal atlas actually changes.

Okay, I think we can see it as follows. A topological manifold comes equipped with a maximal *topological* atlas. This atlas contains all information about the topology and local Euclideanness.

To impose a differentiable structure, we add an additional atlas, namely the maximal *differentiable* atlas. So in a way, we can say that a differentiable manifold is endowed with two atlases. However, it turns out that the topological atlas is not needed because it can be recovered from the differentiable atlas.

Now, when we apply the forgetful functor, we simply forget about the differentiable atlas, and what remains is the maximal *topological* atlas.

So you were right when you said "the atlas does not change". I suppose I was just extremely sloppy here. Does that resolve some things?
