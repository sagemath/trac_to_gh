It would be nice to allow forgetful functors for manifolds. In particular:

- differentiable manifolds -> topological manifolds
- (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds -> differentiable manifolds (not a category yet)
- topological manifolds -> sets (?)

and probably even more. The last point, if getting to work somehow, might also be useful and/or should be seen in view of #30832.

At the moment, we have the following behavior (which could be seen as a bug):

```
sage: from sage.categories.functor import ForgetfulFunctor
sage: from sage.categories.manifolds import Manifolds
sage: F = ForgetfulFunctor(Manifolds(RR).Differentiable(), Manifolds(RR).Topological())
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: F(M)
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


Depends on #31247

Foremost charts, transition maps and their domains need to be copied since they encode the manifold's topology. I don't think that more data are necessary, except for the name and the dimension.

Is there a ticket devoted to pickling of manifolds yet?

Because you have a genuinely different manifold when your maximal atlas changes. This is *not* the result of applying the forgetful functor as an embedding of subcategories.

See above. It is mathematically wrong to not obtain a differentiable manifold from the forgetful functor if you want differentiable manifolds to be a subcategory of topological manifolds. I don't see how the category of differentiable manifolds is not a subcategory of topological manifolds (in the mathematical sense of a subcategory). If you want to call this the forgetful functor, you need to prove to me that the maximal atlas actually changes.

Okay, I think we can see it as follows. A topological manifold comes equipped with a maximal *topological* atlas. This atlas contains all information about the topology and local Euclideanness.

To impose a differentiable structure, we add an additional atlas, namely the maximal *differentiable* atlas. So in a way, we can say that a differentiable manifold is endowed with two atlases. However, it turns out that the topological atlas is not needed because it can be recovered from the differentiable atlas.

Now, when we apply the forgetful functor, we simply forget about the differentiable atlas, and what remains is the maximal *topological* atlas.

So you were right when you said "the atlas does not change". I suppose I was just extremely sloppy here. Does that resolve some things?

Ye. Thus what you really want is a way to create a copy of the current data, but with the category changed. This is similar to the `change_ring()` method of matrices.

If we want to work with that manifold in terms of a topological manifold, we must turn (or rather copy) it into an instance of `TopologicalManifold`. Changing the category or a structure attribute alone wouldn't do the job, no?",

Yea, perhaps I was a little imprecise. I meant change the necessary information in the copy.
