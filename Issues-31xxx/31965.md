```
At various places in the Sage code base, temporary symbolic variables are used. They are named in an ad-hoc manner which can often clash with user-defined names.

For example, the following gives mathematically wrong answers, because `t0` is used internally as a temporary variable in the conversion to and from Maxima.

```
sage: var('x t0')
(x, t0)
sage: function('f')
f
sage: diff(f(x,t0),x).subs({x:x-t0,t0:x+t0}).simplify_full()
-D[1](f)(t0, t0 + x) + 2*D[1](f)(t0, -t0 + 2*x) + D[0](f)(-t0 + x, t0 + x) - D[1](f)(-t0 + x, t0 + x)
```

This ticket fixes these issues by creating fresh variables with unique names where appropriate and otherwise using variables named `_symbol...` which are less likely to clash with user-defined variables. We now also warn if a user tries to define variables which may lead to clashes.

**Creating *fresh* variables should be avoided whenever possible, since that creates a memory leak. Using a pool of temporary variables that get reused is better.**
Furthermore, we replace some uses of `sage.calculus.var.var`,
which unnecessarily pollute the global namespace,
by `sage.symbolic.ring.SR.var`.

I don't think this is a problem. These variables don't enter the global namespace, so unless someone is manually extracting them from `SR.symbols` it is not possible to put assumptions on these variables.

With the current fix on the ticket there is no problem, since there is still a fixed set of variable names that gets reused; just with more convoluted name. It's just that the formulation of the ticket can be read as "use fresh names every time" and that would be a memory leak. That's why I added the clarification to the ticket description and not in a comment on the ticket. So: yes, positive is fine with me.

It's just that the formulation of the ticket can be read as "use fresh names every time" and that would be a memory leak. That's why I added the clarification to the ticket description and not in a comment on the ticket. So: yes, positive is fine with me.


That's not quite correct. Some of the variables (those created with SR.temp_var) are freshly created each time and not reused. However, SR.cleanup_var takes care of removing those from SR.symbols and forgetting any assumptions about them, so that they can be garbage collected.
