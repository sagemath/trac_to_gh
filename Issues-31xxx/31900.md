A pair of doctests has been simplified as in :comment:4:ticket:31876 and moved to `calculus.py` (since this is where `laplace` and `inverse_laplace` are defined).

I also added more doctests for the Laplace transform of a delta "function" and the inverse Laplace transform of a constant function, showing that there is a subtlety in the definition of the former.
