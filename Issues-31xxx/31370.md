The goal of this ticket is to create a new module for morphic words.

As a consequence, it will improve the following computations which take a lot of time:

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->a')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: w
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
sage: %time w[1000]
CPU times: user 1.45 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.45 ms
Wall time: 1.45 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[10000]
CPU times: user 82.9 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 82.9 ms
Wall time: 82.1 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[100000]
CPU times: user 5.19 s, sys: 6.26 ms, total: 5.2 s
Wall time: 5.19 s
'b'
sage: %time w[1000000]
CPU times: user 12min 45s, sys: 93.4 ms, total: 12min 45s
Wall time: 12min 45s
'a'
```
