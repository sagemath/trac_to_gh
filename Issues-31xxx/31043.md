For example

```
preparse('''# some comment

some_function(some_var) = some_var
         ''')
```

yields

```
# 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝

𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛)=𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛
```

instead of the correct

```
# 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝

__𝚝𝚖𝚙__=𝚟𝚊𝚛("𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛");𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗=𝚜𝚢𝚖𝚋𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚌_𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛).𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛)

Maybe the doctest could be more similar to the one above it.

Something like:

```diff
-        sage: preparse('''# some comment
-        ....: some_function(some_var) = some_var''')
-        '# some comment\n__tmp__=var("some_var"); some_function = symbolic_expression(some_var).function(some_var)'

+        # some comment
+        __tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(x + Integer(1)).function(x)
