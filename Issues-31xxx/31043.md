For example

```
preparse('''# some comment

some_function(some_var) = some_var
         ''')
```

yields

```
# 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝

𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛)=𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛
```

instead of the correct

```
# 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝

__𝚝𝚖𝚙__=𝚟𝚊𝚛("𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛");𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗=𝚜𝚢𝚖𝚋𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚌_𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛).𝚏𝚞𝚗𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗(𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎_𝚟𝚊𝚛)
```
