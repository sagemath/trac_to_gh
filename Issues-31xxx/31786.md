After having resolved the following blockers:

- #29703 Upgrade gcc to 10.3 (latest 10.x), fix --without-system-gcc builds
- #31624 fedora-34-standard: eclib, singular build failures with system ntl
- #31838 gfortran: Accept system gfortran 11
- #31879/#27901 `libgd`
- #31694 pynac fails to compile with gcc-11 (headers porting) [https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/375](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/375)

- gcc 10 build fails in some circumstances on Fedora 34 (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/LcQ3ufUOJpI/m/lOsDMZ0qBQAJ, https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-help/2021-June/140439.html)

... we accept gcc 11 again. This will allow building Sage with the default compilers on Fedora 34 and other platforms.


Not so urgent:

- giac (any versions) doesn't compile with std=c++17 [https://bugs.gentoo.org/788283](https://bugs.gentoo.org/788283)
- Optional package `latte_int` doesn't compile with std=c++17 (exception handling) [https://github.com/latte-int/latte/issues/24](https://github.com/latte-int/latte/issues/24)
