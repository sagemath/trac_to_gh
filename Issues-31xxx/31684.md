I pushed a branch with multiple changes to the _language_naive method of the WordMorphism class.

First commit adds a sentence to the docs mentioning that the substitution should be non-erasing.

Second commit copy-pastes some code to make sure that the argument `u` is also a part of the language (and also adds a test for it). Example:

Before:

```
sage: s = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]})
sage: W = s.domain()
sage: W([1, 1]) in s._language_naive(3, W([1, 1]))
False
```
After:

```
sage: W([1, 1]) in s._language_naive(3, W([1, 1]))
True
```
I also replaced the line:

```
L = set(u.parent()())
```
with:

```
L = set()
```
since it does the same thing and is less confusing.

Third commit adds an alternative path for "non-letter" factors to speed up the method. Example:

Before:

```
sage: %timeit s._language_naive(100, W([0]))
7.49 s ± 48.9 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit s._language_naive(100, W([0]))
148 ms ± 2.56 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

The code is based on the fact, that for images of non-letter words `u` we only need to check factors which start in the image of the leftmost letter of `u` and end in the image of the rightmost letter of `u`, all the other factors will be generated when the images of factors of `u` are processed. The implementation results in a slight index hell though.

Also while writing this ticket I noticed that the method is way (way) slower if words with datatype string instead of list are used (even before this patch). Maybe also worth mentioning in the docs?

Some quick analysis is that the slicing `f = v[i:j]` takes the majority of the time for a string, whereas for a list, it is much faster. This is also reflected in the fact `v = self(u)` takes 3 times as long for strings as for lists. So if you want to get the string-based words to speed up, you need to increase the speed of word creation.

Doing a bit more analysis (`%lprun` is great for this), the `FiniteWords.__call__` function is being called many more times than for a list. Lots of time is spent in the `im += self._morph[a]` line of `WordMorphism.__call__`. This comes from the fact that for words in {0,...,255}, there is the `FiniteWord_char` that has significant optimizations and no safety checks. In particular, we can do stuff like:

```
sage: si = WordMorphism({0: [0,1], 1:[0]})
sage: si._morph[0] + [265,2]
...
OverflowError: value too large to convert to unsigned char
```

So there are a number of optimziations that can be made across the word code. One simple one here is to just get the raw data from the finite word and not actually create a word until the entire process is done.

Also, I noticed a typo in `WordMorphism.__init__`:

```
                elif not isinstance(domain, FiniteWords):
                    raise TypeError("the codomain must be a set of finite words")
```
as it should be the domain, not codomain.

Anyways, these are all things for a separate ticket and shouldn't be mentioned in the docs.

The only real comment I have is that non-substitution requirement existed before this ticket, correct?

You can also use `self._morph[letter]` instead of `self.image(letter)`.

Interesting, thanks for the explanation.

Alright.

> The only real comment I have is that non-substitution requirement existed before this ticket, correct?

Yes. With an erasing substitution it is possible that not all words will be returned (both before and after this patch). A quick example:

```
sage: f = WordMorphism('s->abc,a->a,b->,c->c')
sage: Word('ac') in f._language_naive(3, Word('s'))
False
sage: Word('ac') in f._language_naive(4, Word('s'))
True
```
The word `ac` is found only when words of length at least 3 are also requested.
> 
> You can also use `self._morph[letter]` instead of `self.image(letter)`.

Done.
