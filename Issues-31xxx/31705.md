Apparently `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base` is a startup module, which is terrible. We add lazy imports at two `all.py` files to fix this:
- `sage/schemes/toric/all.py`
- `sage/geometry/all`

Note some modules are not startup modules anymore as desired. In particular `sage.geometry.cones` is not a startup-modules anymore.
