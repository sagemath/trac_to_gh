(from discussion in #30832#comment:14)

We represent open intervals and the real line, when they are to be considered as manifold objects, as an instance of a subclass of `DifferentiableManifold` and `RealSet`.

Likewise, arbitrary finite unions of intervals become instances of a subclass of `ManifoldSubset` and `RealSet`.

Compared to `ManifoldSubset`, the methods `union` and `intersection` are replaced by a more specific implementation.

`OpenInterval` and `RealLine` will no longer be classes, only constructors.


More general implementation using #31688 (pullbacks of subsets under continuous maps). In this case we would not need to subclass `RealSet`, but rather we would use a pullback.


This will also solve #30830#comment:18:

`OpenInterval` should silently return a `RealLine` instance if `lower == minus_infinity` and `upper == infinity`.


Some API changes to consider:
- constructor `RealSets.point` clashes with `Manifold.point`, could replace by `RealSets.singleton`.
- deprecate `OpenInterval.upper_bound`, `OpenInterval.lower_bound`
- #31927: `RealSet`: Replace `is_included_in`, `is_disjoint_from` by `is_subset`, `is_disjoint`
- `RealSet.are_pairwise_disjoint`, `contains`
- `ManifoldSubset.complement` has optional arg `superset`
- `RealSet.open` vs `OpenInterval.open_interval`
- `RealSet.cardinality`, `n_components`
- `ManifoldSubset.has_defined_points`
