The command `solve([1], x)` leads to the following error message:

```
TypeError: The first argument to solve() should be asymbolic expression or a list of symbolic expressions, cannot handle <type 'list'>
```

Here, a space is missing in "a symbolic".

Moreover, I think that the last part of the error message is a bit misleading, because `cannot handle <type 'list'>` is in general not true.
