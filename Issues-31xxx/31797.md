In `WordMorphism` it would be convenient to have a test method for morphism that can be iterated but not necessarily being endomorphism (ie the codomain is a subset of the domain). For example

```
sage: f = WordMorphism('a->b,b->bcbb,c->c')
sage: f.domain()
Finite words over {'a', 'b', 'c'}
sage: f.codomain()
Finite words over {'b', 'c'}
```

Many construction are valid under this general situation (`growing_letters`, `immortal_letters`, ...).
