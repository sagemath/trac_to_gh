Right now we needlessly construct a polynomial to call `__getitem__` on a number field element. We can just directly call `_coefficients()` and return 0 if the index is outside that list.

We also do some other speedups for the Gaussian numbers.

There is no real dependency on #31808 other than it made things easier for conflicts.

I also did some slight bit of trivial cleanup.

I haven't read the code in detail (and I am not really familiar with the theory either), but can you explain why you decided to create a subclass for the case where `is_sqrt_disc()` is `False` rather than for the other case? (It seems to me that the code for the case `is_sqrt_disc() == False` works in the other case too, at least for some methods. Is that correct?)

I have changed it. I also made some simplifications to the `Matrix_cyclotomic_dense.set_unsafe()` code (mirroring the `get_unsafe()` implementation) as part of the bug fixing. `CyclotomicField(4)` now takes advantage of the fact it is the same as `QuadraticField(-1)` by using the `NumberFieldElement_gaussian` class.

There is still a detail that I am not sure I like:

```
--- a/src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx
-        if type(value) is NumberFieldElement_quadratic:
+        if self._degree == 2:
```
will lead to crashes if someone force-creates `NumberFieldElement_absolute` elements of degree two.
At the same time, I suppose a call to `isinstance()` would be slower, and we don't usually support messing with the choice of element classes too much.

So I think this is good to go. Thanks again Travis!

Thank you for the review.

It is called `set_unsafe()` for a reason `;)`. Yet, that is a good point I hadn't considered. My counterargument would be that we should optimize for assuming it is the correct type of element and if there is a specific need for this, then we can address it later.
