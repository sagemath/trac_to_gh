Right now we needlessly construct a polynomial to call `__getitem__` on a number field element. We can just directly call `_coefficients()` and return 0 if the index is outside that list.

We also do some other speedups for the Gaussian numbers.

Depends on #31808

There is no real dependency on #31808 other than it made things easier for conflicts.

I also did some slight bit of trivial cleanup.

I type too quickly and don't proofread as much as I should. Bad habits. `^^;;`

Using `parts()` to implement `__getitem__()` changes the output of

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x+7)
sage: list(a)
[1/2, 3/2]
```
(cf. the documentation of `parts()`).

I have created the subclass that separates the two cases for the number fields. I couldn't think of a good solution in terms of the classes for the `Order`, so I just left that as a delegation. Likewise for the `_coefficients()` in the new class; I couldn't see a way to get around that call to get the generator. However, it does remove some checks for calling `_coefficients()`.

I did some other cleanup too. The documentation of `is_sqrt_disc()` is poor because it does not depend on `D`. However, I don't know the theory here to be able to change it.

I have changed it. I also made some simplifications to the `Matrix_cyclotomic_dense.set_unsafe()` code (mirroring the `get_unsafe()` implementation) as part of the bug fixing. `CyclotomicField(4)` now takes advantage of the fact it is the same as `QuadraticField(-1)` by using the `NumberFieldElement_gaussian` class.

Timings:

```
sage: %timeit list(I)
1.46 µs ± 5.9 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit I[0]
351 ns ± 2.13 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```
versus before:

Patchbot was green except for one trivial doctest output, which is now fixed:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx
    [78 tests, 0.09 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
    cpu time: 0.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.1 seconds

There is still a detail that I am not sure I like:

```
--- a/src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx
+++ b/src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx
-        if type(value) is NumberFieldElement_quadratic:
+        if self._degree == 2:
```
will lead to crashes if someone force-creates `NumberFieldElement_absolute` elements of degree two.
At the same time, I suppose a call to `isinstance()` would be slower, and we don't usually support messing with the choice of element classes too much.

So I think this is good to go. Thanks again Travis!

Thank you for the review.

It is called `set_unsafe()` for a reason `;)`. Yet, that is a good point I hadn't considered. My counterargument would be that we should optimize for assuming it is the correct type of element and if there is a specific need for this, then we can address it later.
