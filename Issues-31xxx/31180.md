The full list of outside dependencies for `snappy` are:

```
pypng
decorator
future
ipython
cypari|cypari2
```
so just using `snappy spherogram plink FXrays pypng` should do the trick (note I forgot about `pypng` in my post on #31176).  But maybe include `decorator` and `future` just in case those aren't part of some future version of Sage.

Looking at snappy's `setup.py`, I see that you are already trying to conditionalize away the issue with `cypari`.

```
 install_requires = ['plink>=2.3.1', 'spherogram>=1.8.3', 'FXrays>=1.3',
                    'pypng', 'decorator', 'future', 'snappy_manifolds>=1.1.1']
try:
    import sage
except ImportError:
    install_requires.append('cypari>=2.2')
    install_requires.append('ipython>=0.13')
    if sys.version_info < (3, 4):
        install_requires.append('ipython<6.0')
    if sys.platform == 'win32':
        install_requires.append('pyreadline>=2.0')
```
Unfortunately I think the presence of wheels for `snappy` on PyPI will circumvent it.

Yeah, with binary wheels the `install_requires` are baked in and our tests in `setup.py` are of no help.

I don't think `extras_require` helps here as `cypari*` is a core dependency for `snappy` and so is in no sense optional.

This also has the advantage it makes it less likely that this Sage pip package will need updating.

This argument is especially compelling if we throw in the optional database `snappy_15_knots` into this Sage pip package, as that is another 110M uncompressed.

I am not sure. It does not seem like a very robust solution. 

Just as a data point: I seem to be having trouble installing `cypari` into Sage here on macOS using python 3.9, for which no prebuilt wheel is available.

Not that it means much, but we haven't had any reports of problems with `sage -pip install snappy` as our default install instructions.

I agree it would be preferable just to pass the `--no-deps` flag to `pip`, but my understanding is that this is not possible in the context of a "sage pip package"?

> Just as a data point: I seem to be having trouble installing `cypari` into Sage here on macOS using python 3.9, for which no prebuilt wheel is available.


Ouch, that's a bug on our part, it seems we broke the sdist tarball in 2.4.0, on all platforms, no less: we moved some files around and forgot to update `MANIFEST.in`.  We'll release 2.4.1 to fix this shortly.

Marc Culler points out the likely cause of this: there is a `dirichlet.h` in `$SAGELOCAL/include` that is part of `arb` as well as a `Dirichlet.h` that's part of SnapPy.  Since macOS file system default to case-insensitive, there's a name collision which triggers the `nonportable-include-path` warning.

I think it's actually coming from `/usr/local/include/` on my system (from homebrew's arb). 

The question is where the first `-I/usr/local/include` on the gcc command line is coming from. This is causing the wrong file to be picked up. (The rest of the order of the includes looks fine.)

On my macOS 10.15 box, with Python in /Frameworks from Python.org, I get:

```
gcc -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -arch x86_64 -g 
   -Ikernel/headers -Ikernel/unix_kit -Ikernel/addl_code -Ikernel/real_type 
   -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/include/python3.9 -c 
   kernel/addl_code/get_gluing_equations.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.9-x86_64-3.9/kernel/addl_code/get_gluing_equations.o
```
In particular, the includes start with the SnapPy specific ones and then the location of `Python.h` as desired.  Maybe your first `-I /usr/local/include` is somehow coming from `CFLAGS`, or from the `CFLAGS` that were set when Python itself was built?  I believe `setuptools` uses as least some of the latter.

Assuming you're using homebrew's Python, the above seems quite likely as there I get:

Yes, my python3 is (Sage's venv over) homebrew python3.9 -- so this (the `CFLAGS` from `sysconfig`, not the environment) is how the `-I/usr/local/include` is entering on my system. 

This is rather unfortunate and may also be the cause of the issues reported in #31132.
