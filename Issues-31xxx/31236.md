As noticed on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/0Ca0m94lfOE) the hash function of `PermutationGroupElement` does not behave coherently with respect to the natural inclusions `SymmetricGroup(n) c SymmetricGroup(n+1)`.

We design a hash function:
- whose value on the identity is 1
- which does only depend on the support (ie ignores fixed points so that the hash is consistent with permutation restriction)
- which is independent of the domain ordering

GAP has a function `LargestMovedPoint()` for permutations, so instead of using `self.n`, where `n` is the degree of the permutation group, one can use this value to iterate over while computing the hash.

While this does not ignore all the fixed points, this is still OK in terms of the consistency.

Are you replacing something which looks to me as a perfect hash function (i.e. no collisions) with something that might have collisions?

This seems to be an entirely different issue - one can 1st canonise the permutation to the standard
domain [1..n], and only then compute hash.

How do you canonise `[pi, 'a', Partition([3,2,1])]` to `[1, 2, 3]`?

I am inclined to say that one should not hash permutation group elements ignoring their parent group. A workaround, to hash `Permutation(g)` rather than `g` itself, should work, though - although it does not, due to the usual sloppiness of `Permutation`.

Because it won't work. If you do that with `[pi, 'a', Partition([3,2,1])]` and then `[Partition([3,2,1]), 'a', pi]` for the same permutation, let say the transposition `('a', pi)`, you will obtain two different permutations on `[1,2,3]` with different hashes.

And this only reinforces my suspision that hashing permutations of different domains should return different answers.
As you just demonstrated, there is no canonical way to identify the transposition `('a',pi)` with `(1,2)`, why would the hashes be the same?

There is a canonical map from the domain `{1,2}` to the domain `{1,2,3}`. Hence the transposition `(1,2)` on both sets should just be equal. It is trivial to implement a compatible hash function. This is what this ticket is about.

> As you just demonstrated, there is no canonical way to identify the transposition `('a',pi)` with `(1,2)`, why would the hashes be the same?

The hashes are different.

It seems like you have incompatible goals for a hash function.

* It should be as fast as possible to compute for elements of a fixed permutation group.  Dima's suggestion about the base is an interesting idea for a way to compute hashes by only considering a few elements.  But it's clearly not going to be consistent across subgroup relations (including `S_n c S_{n+1}` considered here), and it requires a precomputation for each permutation group (the base).
* It should depend only on the permutation, not the group.  Yes, there are other parts of Sage where hashing and equality testing are incompatible

```
sage: mod(1,3) == -2

but this compatibility is still a desirable feature of a hash function.

Vincent's solution seems like a pretty good way to achieve the second goal.  Dima, if you'd like to argue that we should drop compatibility of hash functions across different permutation groups in the interest of speed, I think that discussion should be taken back to the sage-devel thread.

I wonder if it's reasonable to have a "hash mode" option for parents where a user can indicate that they want hashes to be as fast as possible, dropping compatibility across parents.  Maybe this could disable implicit coercions and require explicit conversions?

Thanks for your input. The branch I provided is a bit slower than the previous code in case the domain is the standard one, ie `{1, 2, ..., n}`

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -r5 for s in S: h = hash(s)
1.02 s ± 24.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) # old version
1.32 s ± 11.3 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 5 runs, 1 loop each) # new version
```
The time difference is plausibly due to the extra call `P._has_natural_domain()` which is here repeated 10 factorial times. I do not have any idea to improve the timing without Cythonizing the parent.

As expected the code is significatively slower in case the domain is non standard

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i'])
sage: %timeit -r5 for s in S: h = hash(s)
109 ms ± 511 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 5 runs, 10 loops each) # old version
3.56 s ± 4.19 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 5 runs, 1 loop each) # new version
```
If the latter is a problem, it is possible to store the hashes of elements in the domain in a C array inside the parent. Should I do that?

Since the parent isn't Cythonized, where would that array go?  I think speeding up this case would be worthwhile, and recording the domain's hashes seems like a good way to do it.

The speed comparison I was thinking about, though, wasn't either of these.  Instead, I think Dima was suggesting that we can make a much faster hash function than the current one in the case where `n` is large.  I think speeding things up for large `n` is worthwhile, but there are plenty of cases where Sage is pretty bad.  I think the hash code is fine in comparison:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(2000)
sage: %timeit a = S.random_element()
639 ms ± 15.3 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10^8)
sage: %time hash(a)

> PermutationGroupElement hashes have to be compatible w.r.t. to subgroups of this group (and, by the way, using images of the base - which gets computed as soon as almost any kind of nontrivial computation has to be done - to compute the hash is obviously good here), but I fail to understand why this would be desirable for groups with different domains, and to me domains (1,2,3) and (2,1,3) are different, as different as (1,2,3) and (7,8,9).

I agree that they are different, but Sage currently allows equality testing between them:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup([1,2,3])                                                                                                                                                                                                            
sage: T = SymmetricGroup([2,3,1])                                                                                                                                                                                                            
sage: S('(2,1)')                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
(1,2)
sage: T('(2,1)')                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
(2,1)
sage: T('(2,1)') == S('(2,1)')                                                                                                                                                                                                               
True
```
I wouldn't object to prohibiting a coercion map between these parents (as you say, the domains are different since permutations are all about the ordering of domain, not just the labels), but I'd say that should also be discussed more broadly.

There is the [Python array object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html) that can store whatever C data you want. We will still suffer from the attribute access to the Python parent. But it will not be a factor x30 as it is currently

```
This solution is not ideal as the hash array could be made available on the domain itself and not on the symmetric group. It could end up with many duplications of this array (ie when constructing subgroups).
