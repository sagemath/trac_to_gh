#34251 adds `cvxpy` and a MIP backend.

Here we add:

- [python-mip](https://github.com/coin-or/python-mip)

- [mip-cvxpy](https://pypi.org/project/mip-cvxpy/) · [repo](https://github.com/jurasofish/mip_cvxpy)

- a new SDP backend;

See also:
- #26511 Meta-ticket: Use Python optimization interfaces: PuLP, Pyomo, cylp...
- #33487 package cylp - needed for the CBC backend
- #33493 package ortools - provides some more backends

Then I manually copy `./cbc-c-linux-x86-64.so` to `/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mip/libraries`

it's good enough for now. But `coin_backend.pyx` with `model.setNumberThreads(ncpus())` is way better... if it wasn't broken.
