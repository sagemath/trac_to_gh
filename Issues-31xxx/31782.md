Gurobi has a parameter "IntegralityFocus" described at

- https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/integralityfocus.html

which however is not supported by sage-numerical-backends-gurobi.

A fix was proposed in the pull request

- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/pull/5

but it remains open for quite a while.

Initial report:

- [Ask Sage question 55959: solver parameter not available in Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55959)
