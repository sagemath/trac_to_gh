We propose to implement `LRPCCode`, a class describing low rank parity check (LRPC) codes. LRPC codes are the rank metric equivalent of LDPC codes in Hamming metric. An LRPC[n, k, d] code is defined by a subspace F of low dimension d such that the elements of the parity check matrix H span this subspace F.
