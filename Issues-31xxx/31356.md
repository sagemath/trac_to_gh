```
The specific code in `Makefile.in` for the documentation and its dependencies is moved to the new script packages.

In preparation for #32759:
- We introduce another installation tree (in addition to `SAGE_LOCAL` and `SAGE_VENV`), called `SAGE_DOCS`. When the installation tree variable is empty, we suppress building the package.
- We introduce a mechanism to select an installation tree, the file `trees.txt`. Using this mechanism, we associate the new script packages with the installation tree `SAGE_DOCS`.

Next step: 
- #32759 `./configure --disable-doc`
- #29868 pip-installable packages `sagemath-doc-src`, `sagemath-doc-inventory`, `sagemath-doc-html`, `sagemath-doc-pdf`
- rename `src/doc/bootstrap` to `build/pkgs/sagemath_doc_html/bootstrap`.
