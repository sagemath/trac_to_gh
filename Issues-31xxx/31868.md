Keyboard interrupt of `JuPyMake` kills an ipython session, but not a python session.

This is in `sage -sh` and then in `ipython`, so in sage's ipython:

```
In [1]: import JuPyMake                                                                                                                                                             

In [2]: JuPyMake.InitializePolymake()                                                                                                                                               
Out[2]: True

In [4]: JuPyMake.ExecuteCommand("$p=cube(15);")                                                                                                                                     
Out[4]: (True, '', '', '')

In [5]: JuPyMake.ExecuteCommand("$q=$p->VERTICES;")  
```

Interrupting the last command kills ipython, whereas in python it just gets ignored as intended (not nice, but a lot better).

One thing that is fixed upstream is that `InitializePolymake` is called implicitly instead of a segmentation fault, by accessing a NULL-pointer to a non-existent session. That would be nice to have.



Regarding the signals nothing changed upstream as far as I can see. Apparently the signal handling is just not working that way for me.  It is even worse as it completely breaks my `SIGINT` handling. After calling `polymake` once any keyboard in the same sage session leads to immediate hard crash.

With the following patch it works for me (similar to what normaliz does):

```diff

+    PyOS_sighandler_t prev_action2 = PyOS_setsig(SIGALRM, interrupt_signal_handler);     \

-        PyErr_SetString(PyExc_KeyboardInterrupt, "polymake interrupted");    \
-        PyErr_SetInterrupt();                                                \
-        PyErr_CheckSignals();                                                \
-        return NULL;                                                         \
-    }                                                                        \
-    sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &signal_block_set, NULL);
```

In this case the signal is ignored as desired and then a keyboard interrupt is raised after the polymake command finishes.

There is definitely a problem with JuPyMake, as it assumes that `SIGINT` and `SIGALARM` are not not blocked. It should record the old signals and then reset the mask to the old values. However, it does not fix my issue and I don't understand why.
