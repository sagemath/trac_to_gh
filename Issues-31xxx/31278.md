This dependency pulls in a full installation of the Jupyter notebook. 

```
notebook>=4.4.1->widgetsnbextension~=3.5.0->ipywidgets==7.5.1
```
This is an obstacle to avoiding to build a copy of the jupyter notebook (connecting to a system jupyter notebook).

The dependency is being removed in the widgetsnbextension 4.x series (currently alpha). We backport it to the stable release.
