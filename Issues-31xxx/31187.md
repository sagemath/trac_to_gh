```
At least on the latest release build I did, running the `cython()` function is extremely slow, even for compiling a trivial function, taking up to a minute on my system.

```
sage: %timeit cython('def foo(): pass')
48.3 s ± 497 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

While I recall it being slower on Cygwin than on Linux (almost anything that involves running a subprocess is) I don't recall it ever being *this* slow.

Depends on #31344

Keywords: **cygwin cython**

One observation is that every time I call `cython()` the CPU usage of "Windows Defender Antivirus Service" spikes.

For reference this is definitely responsible for the majority of this overhead:
