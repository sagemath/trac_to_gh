At least on the latest release build I did, running the `cython()` function is extremely slow, even for compiling a trivial function, taking up to a minute on my system.

```
sage: %timeit cython('def foo(): pass')
48.3 s ± 497 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

While I recall it being slower on Cygwin than on Linux (almost anything that involves running a subprocess is) I don't recall it ever being *this* slow.

**Keywords:** cygwin cython

**Dependencies:** #31344

One observation is that every time I call `cython()` the CPU usage of "Windows Defender Antivirus Service" spikes.

It seems to be `sage.env.cython_aliases` that's responsible for this, as it makes many `pkgconfig` calls each time using a subprocess, and is called every time `cythonize()` is called.  ISTM it should be possible to cache the results of this call; maybe even run it in the background after Sage starts.

For reference this is definitely responsible for the majority of this overhead:

```
sage: %timeit sage.env.cython_aliases()
48.6 s ± 1.97 s per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
