I don't see how it applies here. PEP 8 is older than the code in question. There are certainly PEP 8 standards that need to be ignored at times, because they make the code less readable. I don't see how it is the case for "multiple statements on one line"

So you are basically proposing removing the lint badge again? Because when it's always red, there is no reason of having it. I don't think a lot of people pay attention to it and read the details, when it always fails.

Such code style tickets can be an opportunity
to visit some files one might not visit otherwise,
and notice other needed changes.

I'm happy with the changes you propose.
I'm adding a commit to fix imports, docstrings,
and a few typos, can you cross-review that?

If that's too unrelated and you'd rather keep
this focused, revert the branch field to your branch.
