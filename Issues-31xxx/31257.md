```
The method `quo_rem` of `LaurentPolynomial_mpair` gives wrong answers:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: q, r = (1/x).quo_rem(y) ; q, r
(0, 1)
sage: q*y + r == 1/x
False
```

As remarked [on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/PhXn1WEShwA) it is not clear which should be the preferred answer in this case: both `(0, 1/x)` and `(1/(x*y), 0)` are correct because `y` is a unit.

I would go for `(0, 1/x)`.

Integers and polynomials seem to adopt the other option:

```
sage: 10.quo_rem(-1)
(-10, 0)
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: (x+1).quo_rem(-1)
(-x - 1, 0)
```

The PR fixes two bugs.

A Laurent polynomial is stored as a pair: a polynomial, and a tuple of offsets for the exponents. The `quo_rem` method divides these two multivariable polynomials, but did not apply the appropriate offset to the remainder (although it did apply the correct offset to the quotient). This means that the remainder was usually wrong (not just in corner cases). Indeed, one of the doctests was incorrect:

```
sage: R.<s, t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: (s^-2-t^2).quo_rem(s-t)
(s + t, -s^4 + 1)
```
This is mathematically wrong, because the remainder should be `s^-2 - s^2`.

The other bug is less serious.  It was caused by the non-uniqueness of the representation of a Laurent polynomial. For example, `x^2` could be represented as `x^2` with an offset of `0` in the exponent, or as the constant `1` with an offset of `2` in the exponent of `x`. Changing the representation will often change the result of `quo_rem`, so it could easily happen that `g == g_1`, but `f.quo_rem(g)` is not equal to `f.quo_rem(g1)`. To fix this, I applied the `normalize` method in order to put `self` and `right` into standard form before applying the polynomial division. This should make the output of `quo_rem` unique.

A question, because I am not a cython expert (or python expert). The `quo_rem` method should not change `self`, so, instead of `self.normalize()`, I wrote

```
cdef LaurentPolynomial_mpair selfl = <LaurentPolynomial_mpair> self
selfl._normalize()
```
Is it true that this will normalize a copy of `self`, and leave `self` unchanged?

In the univariate case, Laurent polynomials are always stored in normalized form: "A Laurent series is a pair `(u(t), n)`, where either `u = 0` (to some precision) or `u` is a unit." The requirement that u is a unit means that the constant term is not 0, which is what it means to be normalized in the univariate case. Since the input is already normalized, there is no need to normalize it again. 

But multivariate Laurent polynomials are not automatically normalized when they are created (or at other times).

Thanks for the review!  

For some reason, my explanation about the commit in [comment:6](#comment%3A6) did not get uploaded, so I will paraphrase it now, for the record:

My original commit did change `self`. (Casting a pointer does not make a copy.) So it is necessary to explicitly make a copy of `self` and `right`.
