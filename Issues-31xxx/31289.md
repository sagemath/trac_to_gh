According to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/index.html#extension-metadata one should specify `parallel_read_safe` if the builder is able to read source files in parallel.

> `'parallel_read_safe'`: a boolean that specifies if parallel reading of source files can be used when the extension is loaded. It defaults to `False`, i.e. you have to explicitly specify your extension to be parallel-read-safe after checking that it is.


This is done in this ticket. I didn't have any problem with it, but I'm also not completely sure the builders are indeed able to read source files in parallel.
