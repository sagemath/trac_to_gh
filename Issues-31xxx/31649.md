#31648 disabled jedi by default. This ticket reenables it.


- #31656 proposes to let `LazyImport` fake the attribute `__module__`. That would solve the problem mentioned in #31643 that jedi completion triggers the lazy import. However it is still unclear why jedi access the `__module__` attribute when performing a tab-completion.
