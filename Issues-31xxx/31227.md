(from #31132)

#27122 determines whether CC accepts `-march=native` and then adds it globally to `CFLAGS` in `build/bin/sage-build-env`.

#30725 fixes this for macOS, where some packages are explicitly built with `clang`.

However, there is another mechanism how `clang` can come in: Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could again be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native` in combination with `-arch arm64` (which is provided even on x86_64 if `ARCHFLAGS` is unset).

In this ticket, we fix this by checking whether the compiler used by distutils accepts `-march=native` (or more generally, the flags determined earlier by `configure`). If it does not, then we disable the use of these flags.

In order to test this with `/usr/bin/python3` from XCode 12.3 (on macOS 10.15 (Catalina)), we fix another issue:
This python3 (3.8.2) is not able to build extension modules because it emits `-arch arm64 -arch x86_64` unless `ARCHFLAGS` is set explicitly

```
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m sysconfig |grep '\bCFLAGS ='
	CFLAGS = "-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -iwithsysroot/System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/PrivateHeaders -iwithsysroot/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers -arch arm64 -arch x86_64"

$ ARCHFLAGS="" /usr/bin/python3 -m sysconfig |grep '\bCFLAGS ='
	CFLAGS = "-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -iwithsysroot/System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/PrivateHeaders -iwithsysroot/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers  -arch x86_64 "
```

In this ticket, if the distutils test fails, we try if setting `ARCHFLAGS=""` fixes it.  Also, after accepting a system python and `ARCHFLAGS` so far has not been set, we test whether the system python wants to do the multi-arch build.

In either of these two cases, we store a configuration variable that causes `sage-env` to set `ARCHFLAGS` as well.

This is somewhat complicated logic - we are tiptoeing around previous breakage that had been caused by setting `ARCHFLAGS` unconditionally (#29408).

How can we detect whether we're using a Python which requires this? And where is the right place to do it? `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in`?

What I find a bit confusing is the following:

We do not test, whether setting `ARCHFLAGS=""` was necesarry in order to build this test extension during configure

Why do we expect that in real life situations (when actually compiling python extensions for sage) `ARCHFLAGS=""` is not a requirement anymore?

If we set `ARCHFLAGS`, we will have to do this in `sage-env` so that it also affects runtime use of the compiler (some of which is tested in doctests) and when users install Python packages with `sage -pip`.

-However, there is another mechanism how `clang` can come in: Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could again be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native`.
+However, there is another mechanism how `clang` can come in: Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could again be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native` in combination with `-arch arm64` (which is provided even on x86_64 if `ARCHFLAGS` is unset).
 
 In this ticket, we fix this by checking whether the compiler used by distutils accepts `-march=native` (or more generally, the flags determined earlier by `configure`). If it does not, then we disable the use of these flags.

Why is it looking in `$HOME/Library`? Also, the files there look from their dates as if they were created during this build of Sage.

This does not work for me with OS X Big Sur, though: many packages (cython, pynac, gmpy2, psutil, pillow, kiwisolver, cffi) fail to build with the error "clang: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=native'".

Hold on, I have to run `./bootstrap` and try again.

Confirmed, these packages all fail after

```
make distclean && ./bootstrap && ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 && make -k
```

I think the actual error is this one:

```
  ar: adding 50 object files to build/temp.macosx-10.14.6-x86_64-3.8/libsuperlu_src.a

Some results have been coming in:

Still waiting for the tests with other xcode versions (12.2, 12.3, 12.4). No failures so far.

Note all runs are on `x86_64` - we do not have test infrastructor for `macos-arm64` yet.

Seems to work well on Big Sur 11.2 with standard homebrew packages.  When running make ptest I get the annoying warnings:

ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.14.6)

which is probably because the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET for /usr/bin/python3 is set to 10.14.6 which doesn't match what Homebrew sets. It's easy enough to eliminate the warnings by setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 before doing all the testing.
