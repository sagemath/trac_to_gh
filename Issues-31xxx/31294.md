```
Finite fields in the givaro implementation have
a `fetch_int` method, which is not present in the
`pari` implementation.

Define a prime and a finite field:

```
sage: p = 4091
sage: F = GF(p^2, 'a')
```

Before this ticket:

```
sage: F.fetch_int(3*p + 2)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'FiniteField_pari_ffelt_with_category' object has no attribute 'fetch_int'
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: F.fetch_int(3*4091 + 2)
3*a + 2
```

```diff
