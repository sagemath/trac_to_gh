<a id='comment:2'></a>In `src/sage/quadratic_forms/special_values.py`
* This change

```diff
         if n <= 0:
             return infinity
-        if n > 0:
-            return factorial(n-1)
+        else:
+            return factorial(n - 1)
```
  can be simplified like this, no ?

```diff
         if n <= 0:
             return infinity
-        if n > 0:
-            return factorial(n-1)
+        return factorial(n - 1)
```

* You cannot do this change, unless you are sure that `n` will never be 0.

```diff
             if n < 0:
                 ans /= n
                 n += 1
-            elif n > 0:
+            else:
                 n += -1
                 ans *= n
```
