We remove the ad-hoc conversion of data to `RDF` in `InteractiveLPProblem.feasible_set`.  This is outdated and problematic:
- the polyhedra code over `RDF` is not robust at all 
- Sage has good support for algebraic polyhedra via normaliz.

We also make the printing code in `_latex_product` more robust: 
- it no longer relies on `SR` to decide whether a coefficient needs to be wrapped in parens; instead, we use the same simple test that `sage.misc.repr.coeff_repr` already uses
- recognizing trivial coefficients (0, 1) is switched to comparing text instead of comparing elements - in order to support fields such as `SR` where `==` is magic
