In case the ecl evaluation results in an error, now the command string is displayed in the error message as well. Should make debugging easier if one knows which command fails.

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment%3A8):
> In any case, you'd be catching an error that has just been constructed in `ecl_safe_eval`.
> If you want to include more ECL traceback information, then perhaps extracting it from ECL might be better. 

I agree! I didn't put it in `ecl_safe_eval` as I couldn't figure out a way to convert the argument `cl_object form` to a python string.
As I have absolutely zero experience with ECL, I have to leave it to somebody else to convince ECL to include a full traceback in its error message.

Would it be ok for now, if I print the initial (python) string passed as the constructor argument?
