In case the ecl evaluation results in an error, now the command string is displayed in the error message as well. Should make debugging easier if one knows which command fails.

I agree! I didn't put it in `ecl_safe_eval` as I couldn't figure out a way to convert the argument `cl_object form` to a python string.
As I have absolutely zero experience with ECL, I have to leave it to somebody else to convince ECL to include a full traceback in its error message.

Would it be ok for now, if I print the initial (python) string passed as the constructor argument?
