We add exact and numerical fields to the category framework as suggested in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/ba9u_As3T4s/m/7J-bzYXgBQAJ.

This should be related to #17713 and in particular #24523, and also #24456.

Of course, there can be added more for further "granularity". This is just a first attempt to start somewhere.
