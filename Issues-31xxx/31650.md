The `LazyImport` objects suffer several problems

1. `copy` and `deepcopy` are broken

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport
sage: sage.all.foo = [1, 2]
sage: lazy_foo = LazyImport('sage.all', 'foo')
sage: a = copy(lazy_foo)
sage: a
[1, 2]
sage: a[0] = 18
sage: lazy_foo
[18, 2]
```

2. Most doctests use `lazy_import` rather than `LazyImport`. The former modifies the namespace so that the name actually points to the object afterwards. Compare

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ', 'lazy_ZZ')
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: _ = lazy_ZZ(3)
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>
```
    with

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport
sage: lazy_ZZ = LazyImport('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ')
sage: _ = lazy_ZZ(3)
sage: type(lazy_ZZ)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
    In the former version, any code that uses more than once the lazy object actually uses it only once.

3. It is not checked that lazy imported module resolves correctly... and it is not the case

```
sage: LinearCodeFromVectorSpace._get_object()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: module 'sage.coding.linear_code' has no attribute 'LinearCodeFromVectorSpace'
```

I don't see why all those doctests need to be `assert`. If they fail, they just give a longer traceback with no meaningful information.

Also, I don't understand what point 2 is trying to make.

They don't need to. It is just more condensed.

What do you mean by traceback? I don't understand your point.

> Also, I don't understand what point 2 is trying to make.


That the following doctest was not testing `LazyImport`

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.all', 'foo')
sage: type(foo)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: del foo[1]  # still lazy
sage: print(foo)  # not lazy anymore
```
I agree that this was not a problem in the doctests.

However, they output too much when they do fail (see below), they obscure (very) slightly that the test should be `True`, and the `assert` tests could (in principle) be disabled as they are meant for serious errors during debugging.

> What do you mean by traceback? I don't understand your point.


You get something like this:

```
File "partition.py", line 7, in sage.combinat.partition
Failed example:
    assert False
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/uqtscrim/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 714, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/uqtscrim/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1133, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.combinat.partition[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        assert False
    AssertionError
```
which is a lot of noise for something that is not `True`.
(I just add this to the start of `partition.py`:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: assert False
```

Because of these points, I think they should follow the standard doctest practice of checking against output.

I see. Thank you for the explanation.
