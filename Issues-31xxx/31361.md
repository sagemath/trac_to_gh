I don't think this works.

```
build/bin/sage-get-system-packages debian _bootstrap
```

returns nothing because `debian-bootstrap.txt` is located in `build/pkgs/debian-bootstrap.txt`.

With the following change, it would work:

```diff
diff --git a/build/bin/sage-get-system-packages b/build/bin/sage-get-system-packages
index 8675f3dbfa..ee8b4666d5 100755
