Thanks for this improvement!

Side comment: when you open a ticket like this, could you please add it to the metaticket #30525 ?

Moreover the `Cc` field of Track is not 100% reliable (recently I've not been notified about some ticket while my username was added in `Cc`; such an issue has been already reported by others in the past).
