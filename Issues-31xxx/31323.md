Currently, if you construct a diffeomorphism from a manifold to itself, you have to specify the manifold as the codmain. With the changes in this ticket, this is no longer necessary and we assume that the user want's to specify a self-diffeomorphism if no codomain is given.

Thanks for this improvement!

Side comment: when you open a ticket like this, could you please add it to the metaticket #30525 ?

Moreover the `Cc` field of Track is not 100% reliable (recently I've not been notified about some ticket while my username was added in `Cc`; such an issue has been already reported by others in the past).
