With `u/mkoeppe/sagelib__add_setup_cfg__install_requires_` applied, I get a different error

Make sure you're either building from a fully intact git repository or PyPI tarballs. Most other sources (such as GitHub's tarballs, a git checkout without the .git folder) don't contain the necessary metadata and will not work.
