It's worth considering to migrate from Sage's custom documentation style to one of the more established/standarized ones such as:
- [pep257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)

```python
def function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Example function doing nothing.


    Parameters
    ----------
    param1
        The first parameter.
    param2
        The second parameter.
        The description may span multiple lines. Following
        lines should keep the indention.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if successful, False otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    Examples should be written in doctest format, and should illustrate how
    to use the function.

    >>> print([i for i in example_generator(4)])
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

    """
```
    
    The return type must be duplicated in the docstring to comply with the NumPy docstring style.
- [google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods)

```python
def function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """
    Example function doing nothing.

    Args:
        param1: The first parameter.
        param2: The second parameter.
            The description may span multiple lines. Following
            lines should be indented.

    Returns:
        The return value. True for success, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        Examples should be written in doctest format, and should illustrate how
        to use the function.

        >>> print([i for i in example_generator(4)])

Google doesn't have this disadvantage and also requires the grouping of paramaters and return value etc. NumPy style tends to require more vertical space, whereas Google style tends to use more horizontal space. I guess with modern widescreen monitors that might be an advantage of the google style.

I've updated the ticket description with examples (essentially taken from the napoleon docs).

What would be the right way to move forward with this? I guess at some point there should be a vote on the developer mailing list.

It's certainly possible but napoleon's parsing is already quite involved and we would need to duplicate that.

By using a standard convention for docstrings we would also get all the other advantages that come with following standards like:
- Easier onboarding of newcomers that don't need to learn a new syntax for docstrings.
- IDEs interpret standard docstrings properly and provide the doc as well as type information in a nicely formatted way. Example:
<img src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2021.3/docstring_example_10_quick_documentation.png" 520px>
- IDEs support generating docstrings in the right format. Example:
<img src="https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring/raw/master/images/demo.gif" 700px>
- There exist proper linter for the docstring format like [pycodestyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/index.html). In contrast, our "linter" currently uses a couple of regex to check that its "TESTS" instead of "TEST".

The migration can also be very fluent; for example, if one introduces a new method or change an existing one then one uses a standard docstring format. Thus, over time the codebase gets slowly migrated.
