Simplification fails as follows:

```
sage: a, b, n = SR.var('a, b, n')
sage: A = hypergeometric([-n, a], [b], 1)
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: assume(n > 0)
sage: A.simplify_hypergeometric()
    n
(-1) ⋅RisingFactorial(a - b - n + 1, n)
───────────────────────────────────────
	    pochhammer(b, n)
```
Note that Sage neither has `RisingFactorial`
or `pochhammer` as symbolic functions.
It does have a function "rising_factorial".

There is a sub-problem:

```
sage: jacobi_P(n, b, a, 1)
RisingFactorial(b + 1, n)
─────────────────────────
	    n!
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>We need to register something somewhere...

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression import register_symbol
sage: register_symbol(rising_factorial, {'maxima': 'pochhammer'})
sage: d=maxima('pochhammer(x,y)')
sage: SR(d)
gamma(x + y)/gamma(x)
```

And then one stumbles on the fact that `rising_factorial` is not a symbolic function:

```
sage: var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: assume(n > 0)
sage: rising_factorial(6,n)
BOOM
```

Maybe this should not test `a.is_integer()` but `a in ZZ` ?
