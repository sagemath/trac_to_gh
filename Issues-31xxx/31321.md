Define a quadratic extension of â„š[i] and
two homomorphisms to `QQbar`:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=QQbar.gen())
sage: L.<a> = K.extension(x^2 - 6*x - 4)
sage: a0, a1 = a.galois_conjugates(QQbar)
sage: f0 = hom(L, QQbar, a0)
sage: f1 = hom(L, QQbar, a1)
```

Observed: wrong embedding:

```
sage: f0(i)  # wrong embedding
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I
sage: f1(i)  # wrong embedding
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I
```

Expected: correct embedding:

```
sage: f0(i)
0.?e-54 + 1.000000000000000?*I
sage: f1(i)
0.?e-54 + 1.000000000000000?*I
```
