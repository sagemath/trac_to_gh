Basically, Sage wants

```
Givaro::Integer::operator std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>,
 std::allocator<char> >[abi:cxx11]() const
```
whereas the library (version 4.1.1, as in Sage) provides

```
Givaro::Integer::operator std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>,
 std::allocator<char> >() const
```
There is no  `[abi:cxx11]` qualifier (or whatever this is called) asked by Sage, and one gets

```
[dochtml]     from . import matrix_modn_sparse
[dochtml] ImportError: <SAGEROOT>/local/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZNK6Givaro7IntegercvNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEEB5cxx11Ev
```

Fedora 32 has gcc 10.2.1 - maybe this is the issue, I don't know.
How does one find out what `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` was for the system givaro? Note, from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html

```
If you get linker errors about undefined references to symbols that involve types in the std::__cxx11 namespace or the tag [abi:cxx11] then it probably indicates that you are trying to link together object files that were compiled with different values for the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro. This commonly happens when linking to a third-party library that was compiled with an older version of GCC. If the third-party library cannot be rebuilt with the new ABI then you will need to recompile your code with the old ABI.
```

A Fedora bug?

On Gentoo `[abi:cxx11]` is there in givaro library, and it all works:

```
$ nm -D /usr/lib64/libgivaro.so.9 | c++filt | grep abi\:cxx11
0000000000017b60 T Givaro::Integer::operator std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >[abi:cxx11]() const
```

well, we can include a short C++ test program in spkg-confgure.m4 of Givaro...

I lack understanding of the origin of  this `operator ()`:

```
Givaro::Integer::operator std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, 
     std::allocator<char> >[abi:cxx11]() const
```
or, shortened

```
Givaro::Integer::operator basic_string<char, char_traits<char>, 
     allocator<char> >[abi:cxx11]() const
```

What are we overloading here, and how? What's `basic_string` doing there?

Not any more, on a current Gentoo I get

```
$ nm -D /usr/lib64/libgivaro.so.9 | c++filt | grep abi\:cxx11
```

What on Earth is going on with this stupid ABI:cxx11 thing, and how to either tell Sage not to ask for it, or Gentoo to provide it?

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment:9):
> I think the issue is that the configure scripts for both givaro and fflas-ffpack are unable to detect gcc-10, and fall back to thinking you have gcc-4. The configure script then appends `-fabi-version=6` to your `CXXFLAGS`, thinking you have an ancient gcc.

Ancient or not, but your "workaround" in -r2 actually caused system givaro stopping to work for me in Sage. I use gcc 8.3.1-r2 p4.

You have to update fflas-ffpack, too -- and then rebuild all of the sage packages that depend on them. It's probably easier to rebuild sage from scratch.

Those dependencies use e.g. `givaro-config --cflags` to determine their own `CXXFLAGS`, and when givaro mistakenly adds `-fabi-version=6` to its `CXXFLAGS`, your entire build gets poisoned with it. If you later install the fixed givaro, all of the things that try to use givaro will be using the wrong ABI.
