This would be nice! In the early stages of the manifold project, I did not manage to do it simply, i.e. without changing Sage's preparser, since

```
sage: D = Manifold(2, 'D')                                                                          
sage: X.<x,y> = D.chart(restrictions=x^2 + y^2 < 1)                                                 
```
would generate `NameError: name 'y' is not defined`. Of course, one could replace `x^2 + y^2 < 1` by the string `"x^2 + y^2 < 1"`, but this is not very user-friendly. Do you already have some solution in mind?

This is the approach that I have been trying out in this branch. 
But it does not work in examples like this one:

```
            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
            sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
            sage: U = M.open_subset('U', coord_def={X: [x>1, y<pi]})
```
because `X` in `coord_def` is unhashable, leading to an error.

So perhaps an API change is needed, after all...

More generally, why do you want to make `Chart` mutable? It is logically immutable: a chart is entirely defined by its domain and its coordinates (i.e. a tuple of symbolic variables). Coordinate restrictions, which can be added only after `__init__` via `add_restrictions` in the current implementation, do not (mathematically) modify the object: there cannot be two charts with the same domain and the same coordinates, but with different coordinate restrictions.

- a string (case with no predefined coordinate variables, i.e. chart created from scratch)
- a nested list/tuple of symbolic expressions (case of a chart created from another one, as in `Chart.restrict`)
After all, when creating a chart from scratch, we are already passing a string if we want to specify the coordinate ranges and LaTeX symbols; so maybe we could admit having a second string...
For instance, we could have something like

```
sage: H = Manifold(2, 'H')  # half-disk
sage: X.<x,y> = H.chart(r"x y:(0,+oo)", restrictions="x^2 + y^2 < 1")
```
or equivalently

```
sage: X.<x,y> = H.chart(restrictions="[x^2 + y^2 < 1, y>0]")
```
Then we could get rid of the method `add_restriction` and consider that the chart is a fully immutable object (of course, technically speaking, the sheafy attributes can be muted).

OK. Then I think there is little point in trying to provide better syntax for creating the variables than asking the user to do `var('x, y, z')` before creating a chart with coordinate restrictions.

Then the restrictions can just be passed as symbolic inequalities to the constructor. (I don't think going the string route would be an improvement.)

The issue here is that on real manifolds (by far the most used ones), the symbolic variables are created with the extra parameter `domain='real'` (cf. `RealChart._init_coordinates`), so the user must actually do `var('x y z', domain='real')`, which is not very intuitive. For some reason, it is not equivalent to `assume(x, 'real')`, which is performed in `RealChart._init_coordinates` as well. Both proved to be necessary for some simplifications.

I don't see why: two computations on two distinct charts can set different assumptions on the same variable. There is no ambiguity as long as assumptions are tied to charts.

A follow-up question on this:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
....: U = M.open_subset('U')
....: V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: XU = U.chart(names=("x", "y"))
sage: XV = V.chart(names=("x", "y"))
sage: M.atlas()
[Chart (U, (x, y)), Chart (V, (x, y))]
sage: M.top_charts()
[Chart (U, (x, y))]
```
Clearly something went wrong here. 
Should there have been a declaration of something on `M` regarding the intention to declare charts with the coordinate pair `(x,y)` on subsets?

How about something like `M.var('x y z')` then?

There should not by any issue with coordinate changes: a coordinate change `X1 --> X2` involves only a set of chart functions based on `X1` (stored as a `MultiCoordFunction` in the attribute `CoordChange._transf`). So only assumptions relative to `X1` will be invoked in calculus involving the coordinate change `X1 --> X2` (such as the Jacobian matrix). An exception is the
computation of the inverse in `CoordChange.inverse`. There only assumptions on `X2` should matter. However, if `X1` and `X2` share the same variables, the inverse is trivial.
