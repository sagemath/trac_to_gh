The [2D plotting documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot)
suggests one can use matplotlib stylesheets,
but provides no example.

This fails:

```
sage: plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 2*pi), stylesheet="bmh")
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'stylesheet' not valid.
```

Expected: this works and there is an example in the docs.

Workaround:

```
sage: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sage: plt.style.use('bmh')
sage: plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 2*pi))
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
