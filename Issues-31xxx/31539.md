On this system, `python3 -m sysconfig` gives
`LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O2 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--disable-new-dtags -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-rpath,/opt/conda/lib -Wl,-rpath-link,/opt/conda/lib -L/opt/conda/lib -Wl,-O2 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--disable-new-dtags -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-rpath,/opt/conda/lib -Wl,-rpath-link,/opt/conda/lib -L/opt/conda/lib"`

It is the `-L/opt/conda/lib` that our `configure` is unhappy about.

From the viewpoint of user installable Python packages, it is actually misconfigured, for the same reasons that led to the introduction of this check in #31132.
The -L options are in the front of the command line, and take precedence over any package-provided -L options that come in from the use of setuptools.

A previous attempt to use `LDSHARED` were not successful in #29408.
But of course in the meantime the Xcode python3 has changed (it no longer seems to use `xcrun`) so this may be worth trying if it can be done without breaking another platform.

Has there been a discussion in conda-forge regarding this misconfiguration of python3?

Nope, but the use-case we have in sage is really a rare case because we usually don't want to override a library in a conda environment. Removing -L will cause more harm than good.

Something like below should give the LDSHARED to use and ldflags to append to LDFLAGS.

```
import sysconfig
import os
import shlex

orig_ldshared = sysconfig.get_config_var("LDSHARED")
orig_cc = sysconfig.get_config_var("CC")
if 'LDSHARED' in os.environ:
    orig_ldshared = os.environ['LDSHARED']
elif 'CC' in os.environ and orig_ldshared.startswith(orig_cc):
    orig_ldshared = os.environ['CC'] + orig_ldshared[len(orig_cc):]

orig_ldshared = shlex.split(orig_ldshared)
new_ldshared = shlex.join(filter(lambda x: not x.startswith("-L"), orig_ldshared))
append_ldflags = shlex.join(filter(lambda x: x.startswith("-L"), orig_ldshared))

print(new_ldshared)
print(append_ldflags)
```

Not clear from the ticket description whether this is a failure to accept a correct configuration,
or there is more to fix than just this.

If the former, we can just waive Conda's Python3 python through, if we knew how to distinguish it.

Is https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda up to date?
