This ticket is devoted to improve spherical harmonics and make them function properly. That entails treating special cases more efficiently and adding a bunch of doctests for checking correctness.

Here is one first approach based on the current branch of #25034.

Any chance to get rid of terms like `sqrt(sin^2(theta))` in a nice way?

These ones are really annoying in Sage; this is why I introduced the functions `simplify_sqrt_real` and `simplify_abs_trig`, which are used in the default simplification chain for calculus on manifolds. They do the job here:

```
sage: x, y = var('x y')
sage: s = spherical_harmonic(2, 1, x, y); s
1/4*sqrt(6)*sqrt(5)*sqrt(sin(x)^2)*cos(x)*e^(I*y)/sqrt(pi)
sage: assume(0 <= x, x <= pi)                              
sage: s.simplify_full()  # no effect despite the above assumptions!
1/4*sqrt(6)*sqrt(5)*sqrt(sin(x)^2)*cos(x)*e^(I*y)/sqrt(pi)
```

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import simplify_sqrt_real, simplify_abs_trig
sage: simplify_abs_trig(simplify_sqrt_real(s))
1/4*sqrt(5)*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)*cos(x)*e^(I*y)*sin(x)/sqrt(pi)
```

The following results given in the EXAMPLES section:

```
Y_1^-1(x,y)=-1/2*sqrt(3/2)*e^(-I*y)*sin(x)/sqrt(pi)
Y_1^1(x,y)=1/4*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(sin(x)^2)*e^(I*y)/sqrt(pi)
Y_2^-1(x,y)=-1/4*sqrt(15)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(sin(x)^2)*cos(x)*e^(-I*y)/sqrt(pi)
Y_2^1(x,y)=1/4*sqrt(6)*sqrt(5)*sqrt(sin(x)^2)*cos(x)*e^(I*y)/sqrt(pi)
```
have signs opposite to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_spherical_harmonics and https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalHarmonic.html. This is certainly due to the [Condon-Shortley phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Condon%E2%80%93Shortley_phase) (-1)<sup>m</sup>. I think we should agree with Wikipedia's convention, since it is standard in mathematical physics. Problably, we should offer the option `condon_shortley=True` in `spherical_harmonic`'s arguments. For instance, this is done in the package [kerrgeodesic_gw](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw):

```
sage: from kerrgeodesic_gw import spin_weighted_spherical_harmonic
sage: x, y = var('x y')
sage: spin_weighted_spherical_harmonic(0, 1, -1, x, y)  # weight = 0 -> spherical harmonic
0.25*sqrt(6)*e^(-I*y)*sin(x)/sqrt(pi)
sage: spin_weighted_spherical_harmonic(0, 1, 1, x, y)
-1/4*sqrt(6)*e^(I*y)*sin(x)/sqrt(pi)
sage: spin_weighted_spherical_harmonic(0, 1, 1, x, y, condon_shortley=False)
1/4*sqrt(6)*e^(I*y)*sin(x)/sqrt(pi)
```
By the way, there is not the `sqrt(sin(x)^2)` issue discussed in[comment:7](#comment%3A7) in the above outputs, maybe because `kerrgeodesic_gw` uses the algorithm of Golberg (1967) and does not rely explicitely on associated Legendre function; see the function `_compute_sw_spherical_harm` in line 27 of the file [spin_weighted_spherical_harm.py](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw/blob/master/kerrgeodesic_gw/spin_weighted_spherical_harm.py).

PS: `kerrgeodesic_gw` can be installed in Sage with `sage -pip install kerrgeodesic_gw`, but if you want to play with it without installing it, you can run this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw/blob/master/Notebooks/basic_kerrgeodesic_gw.ipynb) in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw/master?filepath=Notebooks/basic_kerrgeodesic_gw.ipynb).

Thank you for the input. I agree that a flag for the Condon-Shortley phase is the most favorable option.

I'll probably use `simplify_abs_trig`. Why haven't these simplifications made it to the global namespace though? I think it is definitely worth to add.

Let's wait for #25034 before we wrap this up here.
