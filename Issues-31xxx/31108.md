We propose an implementation of exact p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.

Here is a small demo:

```
    The model for relaxed `p`-adics is quite different from any of the
    other types of `p`-adics. In addition to storing a finite
    approximation, one also stores a method for increasing the
    precision.

    Relaxed `p`-adic rings are created by the constructor :func:`ZpER`::

        sage: R = ZpER(5, print_mode="digits")
        sage: R
        5-adic Ring handled with relaxed arithmetics

    The precision is not capped in `R`::

        sage: R.precision_cap()
        +Infinity

    However, a default precision is fixed. This is the precision
    at which the elements will be printed::

        sage: R.default_prec()
        20

    A default halting precision is also set. It is the default absolute
    precision at which the elements will be compared. By default, it is
    twice the default precision::

        sage: R.halting_prec()
        40

    However, both the default precision and the halting precision can be
    customized at the creation of the parent as follows:

        sage: S = ZpER(5, prec=10, halt=100)
        sage: S.default_prec()
        10
        sage: S.halting_prec()
        100

    One creates elements as usual::

        sage: a = R(17/42)
        sage: a
        ...00244200244200244201

        sage: R.random_element()  # random
        ...21013213133412431402

    Here we notice that 20 digits (that is the default precision) are printed.
    However, the computation model is designed in order to guarantee that more
    digits of `a` will be available on demand.
    This feature is reflected by the fact that, when we ask for the precision
    of `a`, the software answers `+\infty`::

        sage: a.precision_absolute()
        +Infinity

    Asking for more digits is achieved by the methods :meth:`at_precision_absolute`
    and :meth:`at_precision_relative`::

        sage: a.at_precision_absolute(30)
        ...?244200244200244200244200244201

    As a shortcut, one can use the bracket operator::

        sage: a[:30]
        ...?244200244200244200244200244201

    Of course, standard operations are supported::

        sage: b = R(42/17)
        sage: a + b
        ...03232011214322140002
        sage: a - b
        ...42311334324023403400
        sage: a * b
        ...00000000000000000001
        sage: a / b
        ...12442142113021233401
        sage: sqrt(a)
        ...20042333114021142101

    We observe again that only 20 digits are printed but, as before,
    more digits are available on demand::

        sage: sqrt(a)[:30]
        ...?142443342120042333114021142101

    .. RUBRIC:: Equality tests

    Checking equalities between relaxed `p`-adics is a bit subtle and can
    sometimes be puzzling at first glance.

    When the parent is created with ``secure=False`` (which is the
    default), elements are compared at the current precision, or at the
    default halting precision if it is higher::

        sage: a == b
        False

        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2
        True
        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
        True

    In the above example, the halting precision is `40`; it is the
    reason why a congruence modulo `5^50` is considered as an equality.
    However, if both sides of the equalities have been previously
    computed with more digits, those digits are taken into account.
    Hence comparing two elements at different times can produce
    different results::

        sage: aa = sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
        sage: a == aa
        True
        sage: a[:60]
        ...?244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244201
        sage: aa[:60]
        ...?244200244300244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244201
        sage: a == aa
        False

    This annoying situation, where the output of `a == aa` may change
    depending on previous computations, cannot occur when the parent is
    created with ``secure=True``.
    Indeed, in this case, if the equality cannot be decided, an error
    is raised::

        sage: S = ZpER(5, secure=True)
        sage: u = S.random_element()
        sage: uu = u + 5^50
        sage: u == uu
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision

        sage: u[:60] == uu
        False

    .. RUBRIC:: Self-referent numbers

    A quite interesting feature with relaxed `p`-adics is the possibility to
    create (in some cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
    We first declare a new variable as follows::

        sage: x = R.unknown()
        sage: x
        ...?.0

    We then use the method :meth:`set` to define `x` by writing down an equation
    it satisfies::

        sage: x.set(1 + 5*x^2)
        True

    The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the equation
    `x = 1 + 5 x^2`::

        sage: x
        ...04222412141121000211

    This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
    defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
    (this is due to the factor `5`).

    As a comparison, the following does not work::

        sage: y = R.unknown()
        sage: y.set(1 + 3*y^2)
        True
        sage: y
        ...?.0
        sage: y[:20]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        RecursionError: definition looks circular

    Self-referent definitions also work with systems of equations::

        sage: u = R.unknown()
        sage: v = R.unknown()
        sage: w = R.unknown()

        sage: u.set(1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w)
        True
        sage: v.set(2 + 4*w + sqrt(1 + 5*u + 10*v + 15*w))
        True
        sage: w.set(3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w))
        True

        sage: u
        ...31203130103131131433
        sage: v
        ...33441043031103114240
        sage: w
        ...30212422041102444403
```

+We propose an implementation of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
 
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+This module provides basic support for lazy p-adic integers.
+
+    sage: R = ZpL(5)
+    sage: R
+    Lazy 5-adic Ring
+
+One creates elements as usual::
+
+    sage: a = R(17/42)
+    sage: a
+    ...00244200244200244201
+
+    sage: R.random_element()  # random
+    ...21013213133412431402
+
+By default, 20 digits of precision are computed (and printed).
+If more (or less) digits are needed, one can specify it as follows::
+
+    sage: b = R(42/17, prec=30)
+    sage: b
+    ...104201213402432310420121340301
+
+Alternatively, one can increase the precision using the method meth:`jump`::
+
+    sage: a.jump(30)
+    sage: a
+    ...244200244200244200244200244201
+
+Standard operations are implemented::
+
+    sage: a + b
+    ...03232011214322140002
+    sage: a - b
+    ...42311334324023403400
+
+    sage: a * b
+    ...00000000000000000001
+    sage: a / b
+    ...12442142113021233401
+
+We observe again that only 20 digits are computed.
+If we need more, we have to create a new variable::
+
+    sage: c = a / b
+    sage: c.jump(40)
+    sage: c
+    ...4230030104200433321312442142113021233401
+
+Note that this automatically increases the precision on `a` and `b`::
+
+    sage: a
+    ...4200244200244200244200244200244200244201
+    sage: b
+    ...2134024323104201213402432310420121340301
+
+Equality test works but equality is only checked up to the
+*minimal* current precision of the elements::
+
+    sage: c == R(289/1764, prec=100)
+    True
+    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50, prec=100)
+    True
+
+    sage: c.jump(100)
+    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50, prec=100)
+    False
+    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50)
+    True
+
+A quite interesting feature with lazy p-adics is the possibility to
+create (in somes cases) self-referrent numbers. Here is an example.
+We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+    sage: x = R()
+    sage: x
+    O(1)
+
+We then write down an equation satisfied by `x`::
+
+    sage: x == 1 + 5*x^2
+    True
+
+The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the above equation::
+
+    sage: x
+    ...04222412141121000211
+
+This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+(this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+As a comparison, the following produces an error::
+
+    sage: y = R()
+    sage: y == 1 + 3*y^2
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    RecursionError: definition looks circular
+
+Previous self-referent definitions also work with system of equations::
+
+    sage: u = R.selfref()
+    sage: v = R.selfref()
+    sage: w = R.selfref()
+
+    sage: u == 1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w
+    True
+    sage: v == 2 + 4/w^3 + 10*(u + v + w)^2
+    True
+    sage: w == 3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w)
+    True
+
+    sage: u
+    ...21111231040212114001
+    sage: v
+    ...04313122332303332234
+    sage: w
+    ...30020001022124410403
+```

+We propose an implementation of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
 
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+This module provides basic support for lazy p-adic integers.
+
+    sage: R = ZpL(5, print_mode="digits")
+    sage: R
+    5-adic Ring with lazy precision
+
+One creates elements as usual::
+
+    sage: a = R(17/42)
+    sage: a
+    ...00244200244200244201
+
+    sage: R.random_element()  # random
+    ...21013213133412431402
+
+By default, 20 digits of precision are printed.
+If more digits are needed, one can increase the precision by using the
+meth:`jump`::
+
+    sage: a.jump(30)
+    sage: a
+    ...244200244200244200244200244201
+
+Standard operations are implemented::
+
+    sage: b = R(42/17)
+
+    sage: a + b
+    ...03232011214322140002
+    sage: a - b
+    ...42311334324023403400
+
+    sage: a * b
+    ...00000000000000000001
+    sage: a / b
+    ...12442142113021233401
+
+We observe again that only 20 digits are printed, even if the precision
+on the operands is higher::
+
+    sage: b.jump(30)
+    sage: a
+    ...244200244200244200244200244201
+    sage: b
+    ...104201213402432310420121340301
+    sage: a / b
+    ...12442142113021233401
+
+If more digits are needed, we have to create a new variable::
+
+    sage: c = a / b
+    sage: c.jump(40)
+    sage: c
+    ...4230030104200433321312442142113021233401
+
+Note that this automatically increases the precision on `a` and `b`::
+
+    sage: a
+    ...4200244200244200244200244200244200244201
+    sage: b
+    ...2134024323104201213402432310420121340301
+
+::
+
+A quite interesting feature with lazy p-adics is the possibility to
+create (in somes cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
+We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+    sage: x = R.selfref()
+    sage: x
+    ...?.0
+
+We then write down an equation satisfied by `x`::
+
+    sage: x == 1 + 5*x^2
+    True
+
+The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the above equation::
+
+    sage: x
+    ...04222412141121000211
+
+This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+(this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+As a comparison, the following produces an error::
+
+    sage: y = R.selfref()
+    sage: y == 1 + 3*y^2
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    RecursionError: definition looks circular
+
+Self-referent definitions also work with systems of equations::
+
+    sage: u = R.selfref()
+    sage: v = R.selfref()
+    sage: w = R.selfref()
+
+    sage: u == 1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w
+    True
+    sage: v == 2 + 4*w + sqrt(1 + 5*u + 10*v + 15*w)
+    True
+    sage: w == 3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w)
+    True
+
+    sage: u
+    ...31203130103131131433
+    sage: v
+    ...33441043031103114240
+    sage: w
+    ...30212422041102444403
+```

+We propose an implementation of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
 
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+The model for lazy elements is quite different from any of the
+other types of `p`-adics. In addition to storing a finite
+approximation, one also stores a method for increasing the
+precision.
+
+Lazy p-adic rings are created by the constructor :func:`ZpL`::
+
+    sage: R = ZpL(5, print_mode="digits")
+    sage: R
+    5-adic Ring with lazy precision
+
+Observe that the precision is not capped on `R`::
+
+    sage: R.precision_cap()
+    +Infinity
+
+However, a default precision is settled. This is the precision
+at which the element will be printed::
+
+    sage: R.default_prec()
+    20
+
+One creates elements as usual::
+
+    sage: a = R(17/42)
+    sage: a
+    ...00244200244200244201
+
+    sage: R.random_element()  # random
+    ...21013213133412431402
+
+Here we notice that 20 digits (that is the default precision) are printed.
+However, the computation model is designed in order to guarantee that more
+digits of `a` are available on demand.
+This feature is reflected by the fact that, when we ask for the precision
+of `a`, the software answers `\infty`::
+
+    sage: a.precision_absolute()
+    +Infinity
+
+Asking for more digits is achieved by the methods :meth:`at_precision_absolute`
+and :meth:`at_precision_relative`::
+
+    sage: a.at_precision_absolute(30)
+    ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+As a shortcut, one can use the operator ``@``::
+
+    sage: a@30
+    ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+Of course, standard operations are supported::
+
+    sage: b = R(42/17)
+    sage: a + b
+    ...03232011214322140002
+    sage: a - b
+    ...42311334324023403400
+    sage: a * b
+    ...00000000000000000001
+    sage: a / b
+    ...12442142113021233401
+    sage: sqrt(a)
+    ...20042333114021142101
+
+We observe again that only 20 digits are printed but, as before,
+more digits are available on demand::
+
+    sage: sqrt(a)@30
+    ...?142443342120042333114021142101
+
+Checking equalities between lazy p-adics is a bit subtle can could
+sometimes be puzzling at first glance.
+Actually, when it is obvious (from the previous computations) that
+the two sides of the equality are different, everything works well::
+
+    sage: a == b
+    False
+
+On the contrary, when the two numbers we want to compare are indeed
+equal, it is not possible to conclude after a finite amount of
+computations. In this case, an error is raised::
+
+    sage: a == sqrt(a)^2
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+and we are forced to check equality at some given finite precision
+as follows::
+
+    sage: a@20 == sqrt(a)^2
+    True
+    sage: a@100 == sqrt(a)^2
+    True
+
+Finally, note that checking equality may fail even when the two
+operands are different but when the first different digit is beyond
+the default precision::
+
+    sage: b == b + 5^50
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+::
+
+A quite interesting feature with lazy p-adics is the possibility to
+create (in somes cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
+We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+    sage: x = R.selfref()
+    sage: x
+    ...?.0
+
+We then use the method :meth:`set` to define `x` by writing down an equation
+it satisfies::
+
+    sage: x.set(1 + 5*x^2)
+
+The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the equation
+`x = 1 + 5 x^2`::
+
+    sage: x
+    ...04222412141121000211
+
+This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+(this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+As a comparison, the following does not work::
+
+    sage: y = R.selfref()
+    sage: y.set(1 + 3*y^2)
+    sage: y
+    ...?.0
+    sage: y@20
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    RecursionError: definition looks circular
+
+Self-referent definitions also work with systems of equations::
+
+    sage: u = R.selfref()
+    sage: v = R.selfref()
+    sage: w = R.selfref()
+
+    sage: u.set(1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w)
+    sage: v.set(2 + 4*w + sqrt(1 + 5*u + 10*v + 15*w))
+    sage: w.set(3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w))
+
+    sage: u
+    ...31203130103131131433
+    sage: v
+    ...33441043031103114240
+    sage: w
+    ...30212422041102444403

There's a reasonable chance that ``@`` will at some point be integrated in the coercion framework. The use for ``@`` proposed here will cause problems. I'd suggest just using a named method to cap precision.

Otherwise, this package looks really cool! It would be great to see some performance specs at some point.

<a id='comment:24'></a>I'm a bit disappointed but I note your argument for ``@`` and will probably disallow this construction.

About performances, it's of course not as fast as other types of p-adics but I would say that it's already reasonable (although optimizations are still possible):

```
    sage: R = ZpL(5)
    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + 5*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = (a + b)@10000
    848 µs ± 614 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a * b)@10000
    9.59 ms ± 116 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a / b)@10000
    11.7 ms ± 215 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()@10000
    13.7 ms ± 240 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

Compare with:

```
    sage: R = Zp(5, prec=10000)
    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + 5*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = a + b
    1.21 µs ± 9.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a * b
    87.8 µs ± 130 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a / b
    667 µs ± 4.08 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()
    27.4 ms ± 125 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

EDIT: use `%timeit` instead of `%time`

<a id='comment:25'></a>Maybe some comments on the timings.
The "bad" performances of lazy p-adic come from two different sources:
- the underlying arithmetics looses a factor log(precision) in the complexity
- I'm working on digits, which means that I basically only manipulate integers between 0 and p (here p=5) and encode them on longs.

Although I cannot do much to get rid of the first problem, I can certainly do something for the second one: instead of working with digits, I can work with blocks of digits (limbs) of the correct size. Actually, I want to do this but this requires many changes in my current code and I planned to delay this for another ticket.

In any case, when p becomes larger, the differences of performances between lazy p-adics and classical p-adics tend to get smaller.

```
    sage: p = next_prime(2^63)
    sage: R = ZpL(p)

    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + p*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = (a + b)@10000
    3.51 ms ± 407 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a * b)@10000
    73.7 ms ± 189 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a / b)@10000
    83.4 ms ± 471 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()@10000

+We propose an implementation of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
 
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+The model for lazy elements is quite different from any of the
+other types of `p`-adics. In addition to storing a finite
+approximation, one also stores a method for increasing the
+precision.
+
+Lazy `p`-adic rings are created by the constructor :func:`ZpL`::
+
+    sage: R = ZpL(5, print_mode="digits")
+    sage: R
+    5-adic Ring with lazy precision
+
+The precision is not capped on `R`::
+
+    sage: R.precision_cap()
+    +Infinity
+
+However, a default precision is settled. This is the precision
+at which the elements will be printed::
+
+    sage: R.default_prec()
+    20
+
+One creates elements as usual::
+
+    sage: a = R(17/42)
+    sage: a
+    ...00244200244200244201
+
+    sage: R.random_element()  # random
+    ...21013213133412431402
+
+Here we notice that 20 digits (that is the default precision) are printed.
+However, the computation model is designed in order to guarantee that more
+digits of `a` will be available on demand.
+This feature is reflected by the fact that, when we ask for the precision
+of `a`, the software answers `+\infty`::
+
+    sage: a.precision_absolute()
+    +Infinity
+
+Asking for more digits is achieved by the methods :meth:`at_precision_absolute`
+and :meth:`at_precision_relative`::
+
+    sage: a.at_precision_absolute(30)
+    ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+As a shortcut, one can use the bracket operator::
+
+    sage: a[:30]
+    ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+Of course, standard operations are supported::
+
+    sage: b = R(42/17)
+    sage: a + b
+    ...03232011214322140002
+    sage: a - b
+    ...42311334324023403400
+    sage: a * b
+    ...00000000000000000001
+    sage: a / b
+    ...12442142113021233401
+    sage: sqrt(a)
+    ...20042333114021142101
+
+We observe again that only 20 digits are printed but, as before,
+more digits are available on demand::
+
+    sage: sqrt(a)[:30]
+    ...?142443342120042333114021142101
+
+.. RUBRIC:: Equality tests
+
+Checking equalities between lazy `p`-adics is a bit subtle and can
+sometimes be puzzling at first glance.
+Actually, when it is obvious (from the previous computations) that
+the two sides of the equality are different, everything works well::
+
+    sage: a == b
+    False
+
+On the contrary, when the two numbers we want to compare are indeed
+equal, it is not possible to conclude after a finite amount of
+computations. In this case, an error is raised::
+
+    sage: a == sqrt(a)^2
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+and we are forced to check equality at some given finite precision
+as follows::
+
+    sage: a[:20] == sqrt(a)^2
+    True
+    sage: a[:100] == sqrt(a)^2
+    True
+
+Finally, note that checking equality may fail even when the two
+operands are different but when the first different digit is beyond
+the default precision::
+
+    sage: b == b + 5^50
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+.. RUBRIC:: Self-referent numbers
+
+A quite interesting feature with lazy `p`-adics is the possibility to
+create (in some cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
+We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+    sage: x = R.selfref()
+    sage: x
+    ...?.0
+
+We then use the method :meth:`set` to define `x` by writing down an equation
+it satisfies::
+
+    sage: x.set(1 + 5*x^2)
+
+The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the equation
+`x = 1 + 5 x^2`::
+
+    sage: x
+    ...04222412141121000211
+
+This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+(this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+As a comparison, the following does not work::

Fixed.

They are included.
I agree that we should include this code in `padic_printing.pyx` but it does not sounds easy.

> * When converting an element between a lazy p-adic ring and its field of fractions it looks in `_element_constructor_` that you create a bounded element.  Why is this necessary?  It also looks like you don't check that the primes are the same....


It's true than I call `LazyElement_bound` but I pass in `boundprec=maxordp` so that the resulting element remains unbounded. It's a convenient way to do copies. (I cannot return the same element because the parent changes.)

> * In `next_c()` for `LazyElement_div`, if `definition is None` and you set it, don't you still want to execute the `else` clause?  If not, you can just `return self._bootstrap_c()` rather than `if error: return error`.  Same for `LazyElement_sqrt`.


Well, `_bootstrap_c` already computes the first significant digit, so I think it's fine like this. I changed `if error: return error` to `return self._bootstrap_c()`.

> * In the `__init__` method for `LazyElement_sqrt`, shouldn't you check that the valuation is even?


It's checked in the bootstrap function.
I think we cannot check it in the `__init__` method because the valuation might be not known for self-referent numbers.

-
+We propose an implementation of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
+
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+    The model for lazy elements is quite different from any of the
+    other types of `p`-adics. In addition to storing a finite
+    approximation, one also stores a method for increasing the
+    precision.
+
+    Lazy `p`-adic rings are created by the constructor :func:`ZpL`::
+
+        sage: R = ZpL(5, print_mode="digits")
+        sage: R
+        5-adic Ring with lazy precision
+
+    The precision is not capped in `R`::
+
+        sage: R.precision_cap()
+        +Infinity
+
+    However, a default precision is fixed. This is the precision
+    at which the elements will be printed::
+
+        sage: R.default_prec()
+        20
+
+    A default halting precision is also set. It is the default absolute
+    precision at which the elements will be compared. By default, it is
+    twice the default precision::
+
+        sage: R.halting_prec()
+        40
+
+    However, both the default precision and the halting precision can be
+    customized at the creation of the parent as follows:
+
+        sage: S = ZpL(5, prec=10, halt=100)
+        sage: S.default_prec()
+        10
+        sage: S.halting_prec()
+        100
+
+    One creates elements as usual::
+
+        sage: a = R(17/42)
+        sage: a
+        ...00244200244200244201
+
+        sage: R.random_element()  # random
+        ...21013213133412431402
+
+    Here we notice that 20 digits (that is the default precision) are printed.
+    However, the computation model is designed in order to guarantee that more
+    digits of `a` will be available on demand.
+    This feature is reflected by the fact that, when we ask for the precision
+    of `a`, the software answers `+\infty`::
+
+        sage: a.precision_absolute()
+        +Infinity
+
+    Asking for more digits is achieved by the methods :meth:`at_precision_absolute`
+    and :meth:`at_precision_relative`::
+
+        sage: a.at_precision_absolute(30)
+        ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+    As a shortcut, one can use the bracket operator::
+
+        sage: a[:30]
+        ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+    Of course, standard operations are supported::
+
+        sage: b = R(42/17)
+        sage: a + b
+        ...03232011214322140002
+        sage: a - b
+        ...42311334324023403400
+        sage: a * b
+        ...00000000000000000001
+        sage: a / b
+        ...12442142113021233401
+        sage: sqrt(a)
+        ...20042333114021142101
+
+    We observe again that only 20 digits are printed but, as before,
+    more digits are available on demand::
+
+        sage: sqrt(a)[:30]
+        ...?142443342120042333114021142101
+
+    .. RUBRIC:: Equality tests
+
+    Checking equalities between lazy `p`-adics is a bit subtle and can
+    sometimes be puzzling at first glance.
+
+    When the parent is created with ``secure=False`` (which is the
+    default), elements are compared at the current precision, or at the
+    default halting precision if it is higher::
+
+        sage: a == b
+        False
+
+        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2
+        True
+        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
+        True
+
+    In the above example, the halting precision is `40`; it is the
+    reason why a congruence modulo `5^50` is considered as an equality.
+    However, if both sides of the equalities have been previously
+    computed with more digits, those digits are taken into account.
+    Hence comparing two elements at different times can produce
+    different results::
+
+        sage: aa = sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
+        sage: a == aa

+
+    This annoying situation, where the output of `a == aa` may change

+        sage: S = ZpL(5, secure=True)

+        ...
+        PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+        sage: u[:60] == uu
+        False
+
+    .. RUBRIC:: Self-referent numbers
+
+    A quite interesting feature with lazy `p`-adics is the possibility to
+    create (in some cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
+    We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+        sage: x = R.unknown()
+        sage: x
+        ...?.0
+
+    We then use the method :meth:`set` to define `x` by writing down an equation
+    it satisfies::
+
+        sage: x.set(1 + 5*x^2)
+        True
+
+    The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the equation
+    `x = 1 + 5 x^2`::
+
+        sage: x
+        ...04222412141121000211
+
+    This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+    defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+    (this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+    As a comparison, the following does not work::
+
+        sage: y = R.unknown()
+        sage: y.set(1 + 3*y^2)
+        True
+        sage: y
+        ...?.0
+        sage: y[:20]
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        RecursionError: definition looks circular
+
+    Self-referent definitions also work with systems of equations::
+
+        sage: u = R.unknown()
+        sage: v = R.unknown()
+        sage: w = R.unknown()
+
+        sage: u.set(1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w)
+        True
+        sage: v.set(2 + 4*w + sqrt(1 + 5*u + 10*v + 15*w))
+        True
+        sage: w.set(3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w))
+        True
+
+        sage: u
+        ...31203130103131131433
+        sage: v
+        ...33441043031103114240
+        sage: w
+        ...30212422041102444403

-
+We propose an implementation of exact p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.
+
+Here is a small demo:
+
+```
+    The model for relaxed `p`-adics is quite different from any of the
+    other types of `p`-adics. In addition to storing a finite
+    approximation, one also stores a method for increasing the
+    precision.
+
+    Relaxed `p`-adic rings are created by the constructor :func:`ZpER`::
+
+        sage: R = ZpER(5, print_mode="digits")
+        sage: R
+        5-adic Ring handled with relaxed arithmetics
+
+    The precision is not capped in `R`::
+
+        sage: R.precision_cap()
+        +Infinity
+
+    However, a default precision is fixed. This is the precision
+    at which the elements will be printed::
+
+        sage: R.default_prec()
+        20
+
+    A default halting precision is also set. It is the default absolute
+    precision at which the elements will be compared. By default, it is
+    twice the default precision::
+
+        sage: R.halting_prec()
+        40
+
+    However, both the default precision and the halting precision can be
+    customized at the creation of the parent as follows:
+
+        sage: S = ZpER(5, prec=10, halt=100)
+        sage: S.default_prec()
+        10
+        sage: S.halting_prec()
+        100
+
+    One creates elements as usual::
+
+        sage: a = R(17/42)
+        sage: a
+        ...00244200244200244201
+
+        sage: R.random_element()  # random
+        ...21013213133412431402
+
+    Here we notice that 20 digits (that is the default precision) are printed.
+    However, the computation model is designed in order to guarantee that more
+    digits of `a` will be available on demand.
+    This feature is reflected by the fact that, when we ask for the precision
+    of `a`, the software answers `+\infty`::
+
+        sage: a.precision_absolute()
+        +Infinity
+
+    Asking for more digits is achieved by the methods :meth:`at_precision_absolute`
+    and :meth:`at_precision_relative`::
+
+        sage: a.at_precision_absolute(30)
+        ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+    As a shortcut, one can use the bracket operator::
+
+        sage: a[:30]
+        ...?244200244200244200244200244201
+
+    Of course, standard operations are supported::
+
+        sage: b = R(42/17)
+        sage: a + b
+        ...03232011214322140002
+        sage: a - b
+        ...42311334324023403400
+        sage: a * b
+        ...00000000000000000001
+        sage: a / b
+        ...12442142113021233401
+        sage: sqrt(a)
+        ...20042333114021142101
+
+    We observe again that only 20 digits are printed but, as before,
+    more digits are available on demand::
+
+        sage: sqrt(a)[:30]
+        ...?142443342120042333114021142101
+
+    .. RUBRIC:: Equality tests
+
+    Checking equalities between relaxed `p`-adics is a bit subtle and can
+    sometimes be puzzling at first glance.
+
+    When the parent is created with ``secure=False`` (which is the
+    default), elements are compared at the current precision, or at the
+    default halting precision if it is higher::
+
+        sage: a == b
+        False
+
+        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2
+        True
+        sage: a == sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
+        True
+
+    In the above example, the halting precision is `40`; it is the
+    reason why a congruence modulo `5^50` is considered as an equality.
+    However, if both sides of the equalities have been previously
+    computed with more digits, those digits are taken into account.
+    Hence comparing two elements at different times can produce
+    different results::
+
+        sage: aa = sqrt(a)^2 + 5^50
+        sage: a == aa
+        True
+        sage: a[:60]
+        ...?244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244201
+        sage: aa[:60]
+        ...?244200244300244200244200244200244200244200244200244200244201
+        sage: a == aa
+        False
+
+    This annoying situation, where the output of `a == aa` may change
+    depending on previous computations, cannot occur when the parent is
+    created with ``secure=True``.
+    Indeed, in this case, if the equality cannot be decided, an error
+    is raised::
+
+        sage: S = ZpER(5, secure=True)
+        sage: u = S.random_element()
+        sage: uu = u + 5^50
+        sage: u == uu
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        PrecisionError: unable to decide equality; try to bound precision
+
+        sage: u[:60] == uu
+        False
+
+    .. RUBRIC:: Self-referent numbers
+
+    A quite interesting feature with relaxed `p`-adics is the possibility to
+    create (in some cases) self-referent numbers. Here is an example.
+    We first declare a new variable as follows::
+
+        sage: x = R.unknown()
+        sage: x
+        ...?.0
+
+    We then use the method :meth:`set` to define `x` by writing down an equation
+    it satisfies::
+
+        sage: x.set(1 + 5*x^2)
+        True
+
+    The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the equation
+    `x = 1 + 5 x^2`::
+
+        sage: x
+        ...04222412141121000211
+
+    This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
+    defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
+    (this is due to the factor `5`).
+
+    As a comparison, the following does not work::
+
+        sage: y = R.unknown()
