This ticket tracks corrections to pynac's `poly_mul_expand` function. 

(This function is called by pynac's `ex::expand` method when expanding certain products of sums. It is not necessary, but makes the expansion more efficient for large sums.)

* #31479/#31679 Disable the use of `poly_mul_expand` in pynac's `ex::expand` method until it has been debugged.
* #31077 Pynac's `ex::to_canonical` method asks singular to process certain "polynomials", but they are sometimes actually Laurent polynomials. Do not send a Laurent polynomial to singular if it has any negative exponents.
* (enhancement) Modify `poly_mul_expand` to deal with negative exponents by handling Laurent polynomials correctly.
* #31477 Pynac's `numeric::gcd` method erroneously says that `gcd(1, p)` is equal to `1` for every rational number `p`. (See #31411 for the relation to this metaticket.)
* #31411 Subexpressions that have no exponent need to be treated by `ex::to_canonical` as if they have an exponent of `1`.
* Given the number of problems that have been found (and the critical importance of returning correct results when expanding sums) all of the methods in pynac's `mpoly-singular.cpp` file should be thoroughly tested before we re-enable the use of `poly_mul_expand` in `ex::expand`. (Even then, perhaps there should be a flag to disable its use.)
