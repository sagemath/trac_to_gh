Follow-up from #22731.

This is so that Sage becomes fully functional even when not being run from within `sage-env` (which sets `PATH`)

Of course, `PATH` is not actually manipulated, only `Executable` finds the executable in more places.

As an illustration, we update `sage.interfaces.four_ti_2` and `sage.interfaces.latte` to use `Executable.absolute_filename()` from #31292. Then, after `sage -i 4ti2 latte_int`, the following works with this ticket:

```
$ venv/bin/python3 -c 'import sage.all; from sage.interfaces.four_ti_2 import four_ti_2; print(four_ti_2.groebner(lat=[[1,2,3],[1,1,1]]))'
$ venv/bin/python3 -c 'from sage.all import *; print(Polyhedron([[-3, 0], [0, 9]]).volume(measure="induced_rational"))'
3
```

In follow-up tickets, other code that calls executables needs to be updated to use `Executable.absolute_path()` from #31292. The first tickets to do so are #33440, #33465, #33466, #32645, #33467, #33405.

This is work towards:
- #30818 Meta-ticket: Set environment for subprocesses invoked by Sage
- #31295 Meta-ticket: Replace imports from deprecated distutils



Depends on #31292

 This is so that Sage becomes fully functional even when not being run from within `sage-env` (which sets `PATH`)
+
+Of course, `PATH` is not actually manipulated, only `Executable` finds the executable in more places.
+
+In follow-up tickets, code that calls executables needs to be updated to use `Executable.absolute_path()` from #31292. The first ticket to do so is #33440.
 
 This is work towards:

In my opinion, using `os.path.join` feels more complicated.

```
if SAGE_LOCAL:
+            if Path(SAGE_VENV).resolve() != Path(SAGE_LOCAL).resolve():
+                # As sage.env currently gives SAGE_LOCAL a fallback value from SAGE_VENV,
+                # SAGE_LOCAL is never unset.  So we only use it if it differs from SAGE_VENV.
```
Why are these if checks necessary? Can we not always try to first look for the executable in venv and local, and only if its not found there fall-back to PATH?

When there is no `SAGE_LOCAL`, it is the responsibility of the user to set up `PATH`; for example, by activating the venv. Doing nothing is the most standard way.

When there is a `SAGE_LOCAL`, we need to search in it; but SAGE_VENV needs to take precedence over it for consistency with what the `sage-env` script sets up.

Kind of makes sense. But why not try to search in SAGE_VENV even if SAGE_LOCAL is unset?

> When there is a `SAGE_LOCAL`, we need to search in it; but SAGE_VENV needs to take precedence over it for consistency with what the `sage-env` script sets up.

Your explanation also makes sense, but I don't understand why this translates to the SAGE_VENV != SAGE_LOCAL check in the code.

> sage.features.FileFeature: Replace method absolute_path by absolute_filename, with deprecation


So the plan of this is to deprecate absolute_path, then when everyone uses absolute_filename, change absolute_path to return path and then deprecate absolute_filename? Doesn't this procedure take very long? Moreover, there is no way in the meantime to have a method that returns a path.

What about adding an optional `as_path = false` argument (with deprecation if its false). If `as_path == true` then return a `Path` otherwise a str. One still has to go through two deprecation periods, but at least there is a relatively straightforward way to get the path as a `Path`.
