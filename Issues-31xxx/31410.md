Currently, we have

```
def s1(ct):
   L = RootSystem(ct).weight_space()
   P = L.positive_roots()
   rho = L.rho()
   return [beta.symmetric_form(rho) for beta in P]

def s2(ct):
   R = RootSystem(ct).root_space()
   P = R.positive_roots()
   rho = 1/2*sum(P)
   return [beta.symmetric_form(rho) for beta in P]

sage: cartan_types = sage.databases.findstat._finite_irreducible_cartan_types_by_rank
sage: [(ct, s1(ct), s2(ct)) for n in range(1,9) for ct in cartan_types(n) if s1(ct) != s2(ct)]
[['B', 2], ['B', 3], ['B', 4], ['F', 4], ['B', 5], ['B', 6], ['B', 7], ['B', 8]]
```

Specifically, for these it seems that I have to multiply everything by 2 if I am computing in the weight lattice.

```
sage: ct = CartanType(["B", 2]); [2*x for x in s1(ct)] == s2(ct)  
True
sage: ct = CartanType(["F", 4]); [2*x for x in s1(ct)] == s2(ct)
True
```

As Travis points out:

The issue comes from the diagonalization:

```
sage: cm = CartanMatrix(['B',3])                                                                                  
sage: cm.is_symmetrizable(True)                                                                                   
[1, 1, 1/2]
sage: CartanMatrix(['F',4]).is_symmetrizable(True)                                                                
[1, 1, 1/2, 1/2]
```
The diagonal matrix is built from the integer valued version. This accounts for the factor of 2. So in `_symmetric_form_matrix`, the `cm.symmetrizer()` should be used instead of `cm.is_symmetrizable(True)` (or copy the scalar factor from the `symmetrizer()` implementation).

hmm...I am not sure. I am leaning towards no because it is something special for finite type and it would make a difference between the root lattice and root space. Although that is not a very strong opinion.

> (the precise interaction between root space and weight space is unclear to me). 

The Cartan matrix defines the coercion `root -> weight`.
