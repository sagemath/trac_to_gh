In Python the `__module__` attribute stands for the module name where a class or function is defined. However, modules themsevles do not have such attribute.

We propose to add a new attribute to `LazyImport` so that getting `__module__` on the class does not trigger resolution of the lazily imported object.

This would solve #31643

Depends on #31650
