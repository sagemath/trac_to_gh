In particular `libdir` needs to be set correctly, using `sysconfig`, to ensure that it works correctly in distributions that use `lib64` or multiarch installation schemes.

It may seem that nothing needs to be set because the environment variable `LIBRARY_PATH` is already set by `sage-env`. But for #30818 we wish to support also a full functional sagelib when `sage-env` has not been used.

Depends on #31344
