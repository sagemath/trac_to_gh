We add a convex_hull function to projective Berkovich space which allows the visualization of the convex hull of finite set of points. The convex hull is the smallest path-connected subspace that contains all points. 

We add infinity, the Gauss point, and 0 to the convex hull as reference points and plot the resulting tree, highlighting the convex hull.
