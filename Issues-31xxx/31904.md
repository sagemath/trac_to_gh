In Sage 9.3, we have

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: polar.<r,ph> = E.polar_coordinates()
sage: g = E.metric()
sage: M = Manifold(1, 'M')
sage: Ct.<t> = M.chart()
sage: F = M.diff_map(E, coord_functions={(Ct, polar): (1 + cos(t), t)})
sage: gM = F.pullback(g)
sage: gM
Field of symmetric bilinear forms on the 1-dimensional differentiable
manifold M
```
So far so good, but

```
sage: gM.display()
ValueError: no basis could be found for computing the components in 
 the Coordinate frame (M, (d/dt)
```
Actually, `gM` has been initialized as a tensor field object, but its components have not been evaluated in any frame:

```
sage: gM._components
{}
```
Forcing the coordinate expression of the map `F` in the Cartesian chart (for instance by a call to `F.display()`) fixes the issue:

```
sage: F.display()
M --> E^2
   t |--> (x, y) = (cos(t)^2 + cos(t), (cos(t) + 1)*sin(t))
   t |--> (r, ph) = (cos(t) + 1, t)
sage: gM = F.pullback(g)
sage: gM.display()
(2*cos(t) + 2) dt*dt
```
However, the expression of `F` in Cartesian coordinates should not be required to compute the pullback of `g` since the latter is known in polar coordinates, where `F` has been defined:

```
sage: g.display(polar)
g = dr*dr + r^2 dph*dph
```
This bug has been reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57431/

Good catch, thanks! (it was not revealed by the parallel doctest because `local_list_ind` had a single element in that case). 
This is corrected in the above commit (as well as a pyflakes error reported by the patchbot).
