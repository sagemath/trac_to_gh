Grassmannian manifolds are extremely important in (differential) geometry. Thus, we want to add them to the catalog of manifolds in Sage.

The following notes introduce charts and their transition maps very straightforwardly:

http://www.math.toronto.edu/mgualt/courses/18-367/docs/DiffGeomNotes-2.pdf

However, the number of charts grows extremely fast, namely `ncr(n,k)`. One approach could be to parallelize the initialization process to reach at least low dimensional Grassmannians in a reasonable time.

Apart from that, it could be enough to start with only one chart since this should already cover enough (in particular, everything except a set of measure zero). That should give enough freedom to do almost everything on Grassmannians already.

Part of metaticket #30189.

For the charts, maybe it is convenient to use the fact that these examples are homogeneous spaces, so that one only needs to define the chart at the identity coset. The other charts can be then generated dynamically by translation on the group.

We neither have Lie groups nor group actions at the moment. And elements of e.g. `GL(R, n)` are represented by matrices in the (by nature) inexact "field" of floating-point reals. I suspect some problems here.

You are thinking about representing the charts in terms of Plücker coordinates, correct?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates)

The short version is Plücker coordinates are the minors for a matrix representing a point in the Grassmannian and give an embedding in projective space. The transition maps are quadratic and considered as cluster relations.

Does it make sense to first make a projective space manifold and then make the Grassmannian as a submanifold (via the Plucker embedding)? If so, should it have interaction with `sage.schemes.projective.projective_space.ProjectiveSpace_field` or should it be just a separate thing altogether?

I'm also wondering if it makes sense to use multiple realizations (see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/with_realizations.html#sage.categories.with_realizations.WithRealizations), with one for the Plucker embedding and one for a collection of charts. In this case, however, would it make more sense to define the Grassmannian on its own rather than as a submanifold of projective space?

This will likely be a major rewrite of the SageManifolds codebase because the laziness will likely need to extend fairly deep into the codebase with additional linking between objects (so they know how to construct their relevant data). For the top-level charts, this can be done by a (hidden) method that generates the basic data.

Mh. Good point. But I suspect this can be circumvented by introducing lazy versions of `CoordChange` rather than `Chart`. This would make sense because the transition maps (and their inverses) are the most computationally heavy parts.

A flag like `lazy_init=True` for charts could make sure that corresponding transition maps are always initialized lazily.
