Grassmannian manifolds are extremely important in (differential) geometry. Thus, we want to add them to the catalog of manifolds in Sage.

The following notes introduce charts and their transition maps very straightforwardly:

http://www.math.toronto.edu/mgualt/courses/18-367/docs/DiffGeomNotes-2.pdf

However, the number of charts grows extremely fast, namely `ncr(n,k)`. One approach could be to parallelize the initialization process to reach at least low dimensional Grassmannians in a reasonable time.

Apart from that, it could be enough to start with only one chart since this should already cover enough (in particular, everything except a set of measure zero). That should give enough freedom to do almost everything on Grassmannians already.

Part of metaticket #30189.

We neither have Lie groups nor group actions at the moment. And elements of e.g. `GL(R, n)` are represented by matrices in the (by nature) inexact "field" of floating-point reals. I suspect some problems here.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%BCcker_coordinates)

The short version is Plücker coordinates are the minors for a matrix representing a point in the Grassmannian and give an embedding in projective space. The transition maps are quadratic and considered as cluster relations.

Mh. Good point. But I suspect this can be circumvented by introducing lazy versions of `CoordChange` rather than `Chart`. This would make sense because the transition maps (and their inverses) are the most computationally heavy parts.

A flag like `lazy_init=True` for charts could make sure that corresponding transition maps are always initialized lazily.
