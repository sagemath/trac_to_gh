# Issue 12829: rebase documentation improvements in #1173 to sage-5.0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: benjaminfjones

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: erf doctest

Since #11948 solved the main issue involved in #1173 (numerical eval of `erf` at complex arguments), it would be good to save some of DSMs work on improving the documentation and adding more doctests for `erf`.

Positive review to attachment:trac_13001.patch. I'll add a tiny reviewer patch that fixes up the trac ticket references using our special Sphinx stuff. If you like that, switch the ticket to positive review.
