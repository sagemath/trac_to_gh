The problem seems to be that `mod(a, n).nth_root(k)` sometimes returns a value that is not actually a `k`th root of `mod(a, n)`:

```
sage: for n in range(100):
....:     for k in range(2*n):
....:         kth_powers = set(x^k % n for x in range(n))
....:         bad = set( (a, mod(a, n).nth_root(k), mod(a, n).nth_root(k)^k) for a in kth_powers
....:             if mod(a, n).nth_root(k)^k % n != a)
....:         if bad:
....:             print(n, k, bad)
50 50 {(49, 49, 1), (24, 24, 26)}
50 75 {(7, 7, 43), (43, 43, 7), (32, 32, 18), (18, 18, 32)}
75 50 {(49, 74, 1), (24, 24, 51)}
75 75 {(7, 7, 43), (18, 18, 57), (68, 68, 32), (57, 57, 18), (32, 32, 68), (43, 43, 7)}
98 98 {(79, 79, 67), (30, 30, 18), (67, 67, 79), (18, 18, 30)}
```

In the above examples, the erroneous `kth` root of `a` is always `a` itself, but there are larger examples where this is not the case. For example:

```
sage: n = 147
sage: a = 67
sage: k = 98
sage: mod(a, n).nth_root(k)
116
sage: (116^k) % n
79
```

When `n` is a prime power, `mod(a,n).nth_root(k)` returned `self` in certain cases where `self` happened to be a `(p - 1)`th root of unity, but it needs to return a `k`th root of `self`. This PR should fix the problem.

Rebased on #29979, and removed "known bug" tag. Only the last 2 commits are from this ticket ('trac 32084 fix nth root' and 'remove "known bug" tag').

The first value in the line above is quasi `K(modp.lift()`, but here we pick `K(modp)`. Why?

Thanks for the comment. Using `lift()` may be a bit safer, because we know exactly what `K(modp.lift())` will do (lift `modp` to an integer, and then pass to `Z/(p^k Z)` in the obvious way), but it may not be so obvious what the constructor `K(modp)`  will do. So I made the change. We are in the situation where every lift of `modp` to an element of `Z/(p^k Z)` is an `n`th root, so it does not matter how we get the lift.

Can we reverse the dependency with #29979? I think this has a much higher chance of getting reviewed first.

The work issue was really meant as a note that one of the tickets needs to be rebased. I think the order should be whichever ticket is ready to be merged first.

Btw, it would be great to add one of the failing examples as a doctest.

Sorry for the confusion.  I think I put this back the way it was (including the work issue), except that I rebased on 9.4b4 and added a doctest.

I moved the work issue now to #29979. (I hoped that this is what a reviewer would do when setting it on positive review, I caught on to this so things are fine.)

Sorry, I should have done that.
