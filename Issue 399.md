# Issue 399: PHCpack interface improvement

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/399

Original creator: mhampton

Original creation time: 2007-07-03 16:57:24

Assignee: mhampton

Keywords: phc, homotopy, polynomial solutions

I have rewritten the PHCpack interface (phc.py in interfaces) to work in blackbox mode and to parse the solutions into a list of dictionaries.  The solutions are given as elements of the ComplexField.

The PHCpack developers are working on a slicker interface than mine, so my interface doesn't need to be added.

Are you sure?  What's their timeframe?  I'm not convinced yours shouldn't be added.  They've been
working on a Python/SAGE interface for nearly a year now...
