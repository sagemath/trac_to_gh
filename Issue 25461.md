Automorphous numbers are used to compute Spinor genera of quadratic forms.

To a genus of quadratic forms over `Zp` one can associate its automorphous numbers, that is, all square classes of spinor norms of integral isometries with determinant one. (They are obtained by an even number of reflections.)
Conway and Sloane give a mechanical rule to compute the set of (locally) automorphous numbers from their symbol.

One might want to check this versus the same function in magma. At the moment I do not have access to magma.

I checked the output against magma for all positive definite ternary lattices of determinant < 2000.
They agree.

Doc does not build :

```
 sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring.automorphous_numbers:3: WARNING: citation not found: CS
```

and the pyflakes plugin of the patchbot is not happy:

```
+src/sage/quadratic_forms/genera/genus.py:2530: local variable 'even' is assigned to but never used
+src/sage/quadratic_forms/genera/genus.py:2532: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
```
