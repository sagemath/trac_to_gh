Automorphous numbers are used to compute Spinor genera of quadratic forms.

To a genus of quadratic forms over `Zp` one can associate its automorphous numbers, that is, all square classes of spinor norms of integral isometries with determinant one. (They are obtained by an even number of reflections.)
Conway and Sloane give a mechanical rule to compute the set of (locally) automorphous numbers from their symbol. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25698
