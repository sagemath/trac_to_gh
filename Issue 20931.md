Implement a `change_ring` function for algebraic curves. This could just create a curve object from the subscheme `change_ring` implementation.

It looks like it's faster to duplicate the code of the subscheme implementation of `change_ring` than it is to just create a curve object from the subscheme implementation (which would require the initialization of two objects instead of just one).
