Can you rename `COMPILE_ARGS` to `OPENBLAS_CONFIGURE`? I know it's not using `configure`, but that would make the environment variable compatible with similar variables in Sage like `ATLAS_CONFIGURE`, `PARI_CONFIGURE`,...


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-02-27 16:28:38

And also remove this: `COMPILE_ARGS=_`. It's a _feature'' that users can set this.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-02-27 16:32:28

You should add a `dependencies` file.

1. Add a `spkg-check` which runs `$MAKE tests`.

2. Apply [this patch for powerpc](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/commit/41407acc19cd3ca2ee4ab965ed5e19d7776e669e) or use version 0.2.16.rc1

I'll add something to Jeroen's last comment, if we are only going to install dynamic libraries (`NO_STATIC=1`) may be we shouldn't build them either - I don't think that will shave much time of the build process though.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-02-27 20:06:20

A note on tests, the `lapack` testsuite is currently run as part of the build process. The `blas` part is tested with `make tests`, I am not sure how to disable `lapack` test suite and run it later.

* I don't have access to a power machine, so I'm not going to add random patches.

* I don't think you can avoid building the static library, `NO_STATIC` is really only referenced in `Makefile.install`

Well Jeroen (power8) and I (power6, power7) do. If you don't include this, we'll need a follow up ticket. And we are both ready to review such patch.

I checked  little and I agree it is in the too hard basket.

It's not at all a random patch. I found an issue on my POWER8, looked on github and saw that this issue was fixed by the patch I mentioned.

But I can't test it, nor do I think its a priority for this ticket. There are a couple of pieces missing before you can build Sage with OpenBLAS at all. But if you don't have the 10 seconds it takes to create a followup ticket when you actually need it feel free to commit it here. Just test it because I can't.

Sounds good. If I do that, will you review that patch-that-you-cannot-test then?

I guess you didn't have the 10 seconds to open a followup ticket...

I never understood why you wanted a follow-up ticket for this...

I think it's completely normal to review a ticket by saying "X doesn't work, but after applying patch Y it does work, so please apply patch Y".

Comment by vbraun created at 2016-02-29 10:48:20

You fail to mention that it doesn't work on an exotic architecture on which Sage currently doesn't work. Porting to said architecture shouldn't be mashed into every other ticket just because you are interested in it.

I obviously disagree with this... if a trivial accepted-by-upstream patch can be added, I don't see the problem.

And I don't see how it's relevant if Sage currently works or not on said architecture. Shouldn't we try to support as much architectures as possible?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-02-29 10:58:17

For the record, Sage mostly works on powerpc64le after applying #19719. There are some `pexpect` issues, but I guess those might be OS bugs unrelated to Sage.

Yes, but ideally by having one ticket per issue. And not delaying unrelated tickets until we can also stuff some porting effort in there.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-02-29 20:40:10

I'll be a pain in the ass and point out that we support power7 and that this patch concerns power7 as well.
