Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30632

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2020-09-22 20:16:56

With 9.2.beta13, the command

```
$ sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/misc/remote_file.py src/sage/databases/oeis.py src/sage/misc/package.py
```

gives

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/remote_file.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/databases/oeis.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/package.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The "not pypi" url could be changed to

```diff
-        sage: pypi = 'http://this.is.not.pypi.com/'
+        sage: pypi = 'http://not-pypi.example.com/'
```

but the existing solution works fine.

Merci Sébastien pour la branche, et Frédéric pour le feu vert.
