Looks good!

One suggestion - it might make sense to add a comment:

```
        # construct occurs in the InputForm of hypergeometricF
        register_symbol(lambda *x: x, {'fricas': 'construct'})
```

because `construct` is the FriCAS counterpart to open and close brackets in Python, and occurs in many contexts.

Also, I think it is good practice to align the `# optional - fricas` tag with the others, for easier reading of the code.

Final suggestion: maybe the following doctest is more useful, because it also checks parameter conventions:

```
            sage: _ = var("a b c")
            sage: A = hypergeometric([a, b], [c], x)
            sage: fricas(A).sage() - A                                          # optional - fricas
            0
            sage: fricas(A).D(x).sage() - diff(A, x)                            # optional - fricas
            0
```
