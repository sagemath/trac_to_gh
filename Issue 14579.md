Hey Darij,

A few more things:

- There's a "TODO" on line 371 of `finite_posets.py`, I believe that should be removed,
- `element_constructor` of `rowmotion_orbits` is not documented,
- "Returns" -> "Return",
- In `categories/posets.py`, could you make the ``I``'s into ```I``` and similar for ``v`` and ``vs`` (i.e. code formatting),
- Could the `is_order_*` methods be moved into the category `Posets`?

Thanks,

Travis

Good points, done! The diff for finite_posets.py is a bit weird, but it should work. I've also caught and fixed two wrong docstrings in sage/categories/posets.py.

The discrepancy between the lines 376 and 381 in finite_posets.py might itself be worth a ticket...

once again, your new patch needs a commit message, see the patchbot report 

imho, having the patchbot green is a reasonable first step *before* starting the review process

Huh? Doesn't it say "trac #14783: implement toggle operations on order ideals of a poset"?

For patchbot:

apply trac_14783-toggles_on_order_ideals-jsdg.2.patch

yes indeed, but for the some reasons the bot managed to stack two patches that were not supposed to be stacked. And order-ideals.patch has no commit message..

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Looks good to me.

It's strange (and somewhat scary to me) the patchbot was able to apply both patches...

Thank you!

(I also don't see why the patchbot has been trying to do so in the first place...)

This needs to be rebased to #14267.
