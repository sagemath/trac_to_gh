As discussed in #30216, it would be very helpful for further testing if the github actions could be activated for the sagemirror repo as well. 

Moreover, to ensure that all branches are up to date with the mirror, a git post-commit hook should be added to the git repo managed by trac, as e.g. here: â€‹https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3583061/automatically-mirror-a-git-repository.

A lot of branches on this repo are WIP, not ready to test. 

Also, GH actions consume a lot of resources, and I think these are limited per GH account/org, that means they would just clog the queue.

The default configuration for portability testing would not run on the updated branches because it is configured for running on tags only.

I think what Tobias has in mind here is to use it to run the lightweight linting actions.

Exactly, the idea was to run the lint action, which takes about 10-15 mins. The only limitation for public repos is that you can run only 20 (40 depending on the org type) jobs in parallel. I think this should be enough.

The idea was to replace the patchbot in the midterm by these github actions. One might also consider adding a basic build + doctest run, but this would indeed require caching of sage-the-distribution because otherwise it takes to long (one approach would be to hash the pipfile and cache the virtual environment).

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
