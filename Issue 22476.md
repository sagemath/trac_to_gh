There is code in Pynac's `zeta2_eval` allowing `lst` arguments. Let's check if that can be interfaced to Python. Is there numerics available in mpmath or arb?

**Major code integration issues**

- why in `modular`?
- It might be useful to distinguish between multizeta values and
  their algebra
- what is the relation between your code and the already existing

```
sage: zeta(3)
zeta(3)
```


**Major design issues**

Why are multizeta relations not part of the algebra!?

```
sage: 4*Multizeta(1,3) == Multizeta(4)
False
sage: Multizeta(2,2,2) == pi**6 / 7.factorial()
False
```

This is the most interesting part of the story! A lot is (conjecturally) known

- the algebra has a graduation by weight (sum of the composition)
- the algebra has a filtration by length
- a very simple additive basis (Hoffman): multizeta values whith entries 2 and 3
  (it is hence very easy to provide additive basis in fixed weight)
- a rather simple multiplicative basis (Broadhurst)

**Minor**

- You should be more explicit about this comment

```
Beware that this conversion involves the sign `(-1)^w` where `w` is the
length of the composition and the number of `1`in the word in 0 and 1.
```

- the string representation is not informative enough

```
sage: m = Multizeta(3,2,2)
sage: m.parent()
Algebra of MZV as zeta(n1,...nr) over Rational Field
```

- why do you cache numerical pari evaluation!? Also pari has a much faster evaluation for all multiple zeta values of given weight `zetamultall` which makes sense in this context.

What do you mean ? change `Multizetas` to `MultizetasAlgebra` ?

No relation. Symbolic ring is the root of all evil. I think that conversions are not really possible : from SR to MZV, it would have a very small domain. From MZV to SR, it would fail for lack of a symbolic MZV function. This is not at all what I want to do here.

I just forgot to implement equality for one of the two classes. Done now.

Yes, sure. Because the implemented algebra is the "motivic algebra of MZV", these statements are not conjectural, but theorems. We already have the grading (see `M.category()`), in fact. There is room for a lot more work. It would be more fun to do this in a collaborative way. I spent a lot of time already just to make the "motivic" equality work correctly.

I changed the repr to be more verbose.

I cache that because I need a lot of them. But maybe this is not a good idea, given that their number is a power of 2. And of course, using the faster pari method to copmpute them all may be a good idea. But this depends on how the algebra is used.

Consider my comments not as "do this in this ticket" but rather as
- how does Vincent can make this useful for him (or at least understandable)? Given the fact that you spent a lot of time on this you know the code much better than I do.
- Make sure that all what I suggest can be done in the future without changing the design.

Once I am convinced by the design, I can go through the documentation and suggest/change/expand (inside a commit).

But the `Multizeta` you designed lives in a different world. It has an evaluation to the reals.

From MZV to SR, it would fail for lack of a symbolic MZV function. This is not at all what I want to do here.\n\nBut `pi` and `zeta(2)` are (when considered as real numbers) part of the (image in the real numbers of the) algebra you are trying to design. This is confusing, unless everything becomes \"motivic\".\n\n> > **Major design issues**\n> > \n> > Why are multizeta relations not part of the algebra!?\n> > {{{\n> > sage: 4*Multizeta(1,3) == Multizeta(4)\n> > False\n> > sage: Multizeta(2,2,2) == pi**6 / 7.factorial()\n> > False\n> > }}}\n> \n> I just forgot to implement equality for one of the two classes.

`arith`? `motives`?

I do not see the link with modular form (which does not mean that there is not one).

Not exactly. `(s1, s2, s3) -> zeta(s1, s2, s3)` is a function. `zeta(3, 5, 2)` is a special value of this function which is a real number. But the `Multizeta` you designed lives in a different world. It has an evaluation to the reals. But this is not clearly stated in the module documentation to my mind.

> No relation. Symbolic ring is the root of all evil. I think that conversions are not really possible : from SR to MZV, it would have a very small domain. From MZV to SR, it would fail for lack of a symbolic MZV function. This is not at all what I want to do here.

But `pi` and `zeta(2)` are (when considered as real numbers) part of the (image in the real numbers of the) algebra you are trying to design. This is confusing, unless everything becomes "motivic".

As I said, it would help if there were a clearer distinction between this motivic version and its image in the set of real numbers.

Also, if the algebra of motivic MZV is "just" a special case of `FreeZinbielAlgebra` why do you hide it under this `F_ring` function? I have hard time understanding the logic of your proposal. If `FreeZinbielAlgebra` lacks support for infinite basis, shouldn't it be the purpose of this ticket (or a dependency of this one)?

> We already have the grading (see `M.category()`), in fact.

What I want to be able to do (maybe this is already possible)

- access a graded component (as a finite dimensional `Q`-vector space), let say `M` and do `M.basis()`, `M.dimension()`, ... And more generally, perform linear algebra there.

Please use "motivic zeta values" here (unless I misunderstood something).

I will do this tomorrow (it is quite late here and I don't think I have the energy to do it today). To sketch what I will do to `FreeZinbielAlgebra`:

In the `__classcall_private__` allow `n` to be a non-integer, in which case `names` should be `None` and just pass that to the `__init__`. There `n`, in this case, will get fed to `Alphabet`. Then `algebra_generators` will need a case when `self.variable_names() is not None`. Then there will also be some slight cases when checking stuff in the construction functor with disabling those features as checking trivial intersection of infinite sets is not computable.

Salut Vincent. Je crois qu'il faut lire l'article de Brown pour comprendre un peu ce que fait le programme.

Concernant les majuscules/minuscules : il est d'usage de parler de MZV, c'est pour ca que j'ai garder les majuscules à Multiple Zeta Values. Mais d'un autre coté, je propose les fonctions Multizeta et Multizetas, ce qui n'est pas tres coherent.

Concernant les relations non explicites : l'ideal des relations n'est pas explicite, mais defini grosso modo comme "l'ensemble des relations induites par les changements de variables en geometrie algebrique". Et malgré tout, les gens comme F. Brown parviennent à décrire le quotient, à en donner des bases, etc. Mais on ne connait pas d'ensemble de generateurs de l'ideal des relations, sauf de facon conjecturale.

Salut,

il n'est pas question de se débarrasser du F_ring, qui joue un role crucial.

on peut modifier le F_ring pour qu'il ait un nombre infini de generateurs, mais de toutes facons, le code devient lent a partir de n=12 ou 13, et il est limité par la table des générateurs des zetas comme algèbres, qui est codée en dur jusqu'a n=17.

So the code that actually implements the fraction field stuff is in `sage.rings.ring.Ring`. I am not sure how I feel about inheriting from that since it is a subclass of `ParentWithGens`. I would probably just implement the following modified form of `fraction_field` in the `IntegralDomains` category:

```python
    @cached_method
    def fraction_field(self):
        """
        Return the fraction field of ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::
        """
        from sage.rings.fraction_field import FractionField_generic
        return FractionField_generic(self)
```

(Note that `FractionField_generic` is not a `UniqueRepresentation`, so this is not a memory leak.)

Why do you have so many functions as opposed to methods? In particular, I don't understand why `base_brown` is not a method of `Multizetas`. Moreover, here the right terminology here is I believe `base` and not `basis`.

Why do you have trivial functions such as `compositions_23`, `numerical_MZV` or `vector_to_multizeta`. These functions have code 10x shorter than their documentation.

The following piece of documentation is **very** cryptic.

```
        Return the morphism ``phi``.

        This sends multiple zeta values to the algebra :func:`F_ring`.
```

Where are the `F ring` and the `phi morphism` actually defined? There is not even a reference to where to look for a definition.

This is really nice (as a feature)

```
Then one can compute the space of relations::

    sage: from sage.modular.multiple_zeta import f_to_vector
    sage: M = matrix([f_to_vector(Zc.phi()) for Zc in L])
    sage: K = M.kernel(); K
```

but not very nice from a user perspective. Whouldn't it be possible to have `Zc.phi().vector()` (or even better `Zc.vector()`)?

The doctest coming just after is kind of weird

```
    sage: relation.phi()
    0
    sage: relation.n()
    0.000000000000...
```

Why do you numerically evaluate `0`? It would be nice to also print what `relation` is and run `relation.is_zero()`.

Is this global definition

```
MZV = Multizeta
```

used anywhere?

Now, a more concrete mathematical questions: I have a prefered basis, let say `basis_brown`, how do I decompose a multizeta on this basis?

> Why do you have so many functions as opposed to methods? In particular, I don't understand why `base_brown` is not a method of `Multizetas`. Moreover, here the right terminology here is I believe `base` and not `basis`.

This could be turned into a method, yes. I have not done that yet.

Got rid of them three.

Well, everything is based on Brown's article [Brown2012]. But one could add more explanations, for sure.

Clearly, this only makes sense for homogeneous elements. One could have a method "phi_vector" that would raise error for non-homogeneous elements. I am not sure if it makes sense to add a method "vector" to the F-ring, with the similar restrictions.

This is because the relation, now displayed, is not the zero linear combination. It is only equal to the zero element. Of course, we know that the period map sends this to zero, because phi sends this to zero.

No, removed.

Just compute phi or rather "phi_vector" on every element of your basis, compute phi or rather "phi_vector" on your element, make a matrix and take the kernel of the obtained matrix.

Si tu prévois d'aller plus loin que poids 17 pour `zetamult`, ça va commencer à coûter cher en temps et mémoire. Aussi, si le calcul a été fait en précision `10 * prec` ce n'est pas la peine de le refaire pour `prec`. Que penses-tu d'avoir une classe `MultizetaValues(cache_max_weight, prec)` qui stocke les valeurs en poids jusqu'à `cache_max_weight` (avec précision `prec` fixé)  via des appels à `zetamultall`. Si la précision demandée est en dessous de la précision ou le poids en dessous de `cache_max_weight` on utilise le cache, sinon on fait un appel à `zetamult`. Il est tout à fait possible de faire en sorte que la `cache_max_weight` et `prec` soit modifiable à la volée de manière à ce qu'un utilisateur puisse ajuster à son besoin.

Salut,

voilà une tentative minimale de cache fait-maison, mais je ne sais pas trop si c'est la bonne manière.

Il a 4 tests qui foirent pour cause de précision trop grande. J'aurais besoin de dégrader la précision d'un nombre en pari, et je ne sais pas comment faire.

Concernant la base multiplicative de Brown, il me semble que ça relève un peu de l'artisanat. On calcule l'application phi avec un candidat pour la base, et si ça donne bien une base de la composante homogène du F-anneau, alors on avait fait un bon choix. Il y a peut-être une autre base multiplicative proposée par Broadhurst (du style mots de Lyndon), mais je ne sais pas si elle est conjecturale ou pas.

Je suis moins pré-occupé par aller au delà de 17 que par réussir à être efficace jusqu'au poids 13, y compris en présence de coefficients polynomiaux. J'ai échoué hier (sur mon vieux portable, interrompu au bout de quelques heures à chauffer fort) à faire un calcul qui m’intéresse en poids 11.
