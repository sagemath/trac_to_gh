After #20630, the following no longer crashes, but still raises an error:

```
sage: R.<theta> = QQ[]
sage: (theta^2 + 1).galois_group(pari_group=True)
...
PariError: theta already exists with incompatible valence
```

One almost trivial thing:

```diff
-if any (n > 1 for n in F[1]):
+if any(n > 1 for n in F[1]):
```

since `any` is a function in Python, not a keyword. Otherwise LGTM.
