Some comments:

- You should spell out the method names in full `bounded_affine_permutation`.
- The `INPUT:` block should be `- ``A`` -- a matrix with complex entries``.
- You should move the `OUTPUT:` block to be right after the 1-line description and use latex formatting with single backticks, e.g., ``i`` with appropriate modifications to matrix it into a definition-type statement.
- The `OUTPUT:` block should be something like `A partial permutation of length `n` of `[2n]` , where `n` is ``A.ncols()``.`
- Remove the line `For more on bounded affine permutations, see`.
- You can use the more simple (and Python3 compatible) `S = Permutations(2*n, n)`.
- You should use the base ring/field of `A` as the user might want more precision or use a particular subset of **C**.
