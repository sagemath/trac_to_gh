We no longer use `bzip2` in the build system; we use a system Python to uncompress tarballs.

When `pcre` builds, although I see 

```
checking bzlib.h usability... yes
checking bzlib.h presence... yes
checking for bzlib.h... yes
```

I later see

```
    Link pcregrep with libbz2 ....... : no
```

Maybe we need to use the `--enable-pcregrep-libbz2` flag when configuring. To do on a later ticket, if there is a need.

Looks good to me. Let's get it merged early in the 8.2 release cycle so it can get widely tested.

I should also say that I didn't test this as carefully as maybe I should have. There is a copy of libbz2 in /usr/lib, and it might have been better to test without that. If I can figure out how to do that, maybe I will try. (Right now, though, `sudo mv libbz2.1.0.dylib libbz2.1.0.dylib.TEMP` results in `Operation not permitted`. OS X really doesn't want me to move that file.)

I simply grepped the log files of all packages for `bz2`, `bzip2` and `bunzip2` and added `bzip2` as dependency where needed.

Yes, I saw that. So maybe it doesn't actually depend on bzip2. Still, it doesn't hurt much to add this dependency even if it is not strictly needed.
