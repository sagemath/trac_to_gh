# Issue 20697: Sort elements by poset order

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-07-04 11:07:03

CC:  kdilks tscrim

Keywords: poset

Comment by Kevin Dilks from #20494:

"Another thing to consider would be to add functions that take an unordered chain and return the ordered list, take a multichain and return the underlying strict chain, etc."

This patch will add a `sorted` function to poset class.

Ping. Kevin, is this something like you think?

Travis, if you have too much free time then there is one more to think about. `:=)`

Yup, this pretty much what I had in mind.

The one thing I'm going to change, however, is the example. First, it presumes that people know how to interpret a poset from a dictionary of covering relations. Secondly, being a somewhat random poset requires them to keep checking back to the original data structure to confirm that the examples are doing what they should be doing. Using something like the poset of divisors of 36 would be much more transparent.

This is how it is done in many examples at `posets.py`. I don't count this as a good argument.

But "natural" examples are better.

But now sorted does just what sorting plain list of integers would do. But yes, your example is better. Assuming that documentation builds and tests pass (can't check now myself), you can mark this change as positive review from my side. I guess you can review the short code I wrote.

You can and should have both examples: one that is natural and one that really shows that the poset ordering is being used.

Bikeshedding: do we need both complete examples? Maybe full example by Kevin with keywords, and just first part of my example, i.e. the one without additional keywords.

Not bikeshedding: has someone read the code lines? Are they OK?

It doesn't hurt to have more examples (at least those that don't take a long time).

It all looks good to me.

Hmm... It depends. I think that examples should show in some way different aspects of the function. But they are not always easy to make.

OK, thanks.
