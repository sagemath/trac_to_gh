Comment by Kevin Dilks from #20494:

"Another thing to consider would be to add functions that take an unordered chain and return the ordered list, take a multichain and return the underlying strict chain, etc."

This patch will add a `sorted` function to poset class.

Yup, this pretty much what I had in mind.

The one thing I'm going to change, however, is the example. First, it presumes that people know how to interpret a poset from a dictionary of covering relations. Secondly, being a somewhat random poset requires them to keep checking back to the original data structure to confirm that the examples are doing what they should be doing. Using something like the poset of divisors of 36 would be much more transparent.

This is how it is done in many examples at `posets.py`. I don't count this as a good argument.

But "natural" examples are better.

Bikeshedding: do we need both complete examples? Maybe full example by Kevin with keywords, and just first part of my example, i.e. the one without additional keywords.

Not bikeshedding: has someone read the code lines? Are they OK?

Hmm... It depends. I think that examples should show in some way different aspects of the function. But they are not always easy to make.
