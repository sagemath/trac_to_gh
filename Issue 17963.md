Would you remove 

```
.. NOTE::

    If you need to test isomorphisms between one incidence
    structure and many others, you should consider using
    :meth:`canonical_label` instead of this function.
```

in the documentation of `is_isomorphic`?

My only regret is that I cannot be too harsh on the idiot that copied the structure BEFORE computing the canonical label, yet thought about adding this warning.

Idiots.
