Right now, `ClassicalMatrixLieAlgebra` only inherits from `LieAlgebraFromAssociative`, but instead it should inherit from `MatrixLieAlgebraFromAssociative`. This way, all of its elements will be immutable after creation.

We also lift the `matrix` element method up to a more natural place from this.
