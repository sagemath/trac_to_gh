There are too many changes going on at once, so that a merge in the end might be difficult. In order to avoid such difficulties and to keep an overview of things that are happening (for me and others), I use this ticket from now on as a metaticket, where all latest changes are merged together. Cross ticket references are possible.

This metaticket is mainly devoted to the topic of immutability of algebra elements (see discussion below).

This ticket is related to manifolds and therefore part of the permanent metaticket #18528.

**Things going on:**

- #28554: Scalar Field Restrictions
- #28562: Better Zero Treatment
- #28564: Consistent Naming for Tensor and Scalar Fields
- #28579: Wedge Product with Scalar Fields
- #28578: Mixed Forms Code Improvements 
- #28628: Restriction Behaviour of Tensor Fields

Depends on #28554
Depends on #28562
Depends on #28564
Depends on #28579
Depends on #28578

Thanks for these improvements in the code.

A quick question: what is the motivation for returning a copy of the zero element of the parent instead of the zero element itself? Returning the zero element is certainly faster. In which case wouldn't it be safe? Moreover in some cases (scalar fields) the zero element is updated when a new chart is added, which is not the case of the copy.

The method `zero()` of the parent is cached. It might happen that this zero element could be manipulated after some computation returning zero (due to some user written algorithm). I tried to avoid that. Do you think this scenario is too unlikely? If so, we can give up the copies.

Oh, I was not aware of that. However, a result of an algebraic operation has *always* been a very new instance, which knows only about the current charts and frames. The user should always be aware of that. At this stage, there is no difference to the previous code and it sounds fairly consistent to me.

What do you think, which way is most convenient and user friendly?

The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to agree with you. Travis, do you have any thought about this?

Another remark: some of the proposed changes regarding scalar fields are actually not improvements but feature changes:

- the method `display()` without any argument currently displays the scalar field in all the top charts where the expression is known; you propose to change it to enforce the display in the greatest (sub)charts where the expression can be computed, even if they are not top charts. I'm not sure to agree with that: in the current setting, the output of `display()` is sufficient to fully characterize the scalar field (no loss of information); the extension you propose adds extra computations and results in longer outputs, which can be cumbersome for complicated scalar fields.

- regarding the multiplication of scalar fields `f` and `g`, the LaTeX output is changed from `f g` to `f\cdot g`. Is this for aesthetic reasons only? Personaly I would prefer `f g`, which sounds more standard notation. Maybe the opinion of a third person (Travis?) would be helpful here.

> > In nearly every instance in Sage, elements are considered immutable and (algebraic) operations do produce new elements (but sometimes share information because they are treated as immutable objects and some of their parts do not change with such operations). Really there should not be any functional difference between the result of `P.zero()` and creating a new zero instance, and the cached object should be better as it should retain more intermediate computations (say, its values on different charts). If a computation is actually changing some fundamental data, then that is a bug. So I strongly believe you should be using `P.zero()` instead of creating a new zero instance.

-1 as that defeats the purpose.

> However, my thoughts on this were the following: Assume someone is filling up a mixed form with zeroes and uses the `set_restriction` method, which invokes all `set_restriction` methods of its components, to get a new form (just for convenience because most of the components of the resulting mixed form shall be zero in the end). Then, this has an effect on the cached zero elements. Because of that, I decided to copy all the components of the mixed form before declaring them. For consistency reasons I changed everything up like it is now.

If that fundamentally changes the zero from what it is intended to representation, which it sounds like you are saying it does (I am a bit out of my depth mathematically here), then that is a bug with the `set_restriction` method. This might a little better/easier for me to see with a more explicit example.

If there really is no other way out of this with keeping the cached behavior, then you have to manually copy the elements when creating the mixed forms.

Here comes an examples, like it is now (without copies):

```
sage: S2 = Manifold(2, 'S^2')
sage: U = S2.open_subset('U') ; V = S2.open_subset('V') # complement of the North and South pole, respectively
sage: S2.declare_union(U,V)
sage: stereoN.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole

sage: xy_to_uv = stereoN.transition_map(stereoS,

sage: W = U.intersection(V)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: omegaU = U.diff_form(1, name='omega')
sage: omegaU[:] = [2,3]; omegaU.display()
omega = 2 dx + 3 dy
sage: FU = U.mixed_form(name='F')
sage: FU[:] = [1,omegaU,0]
sage: FU.display()

sage: F = S2.mixed_form(name='F')
sage: F[:] = [0,0,0]

F = zero + zero + zero
sage: F[1].display()
zero = 2 dx + 3 dy
sage: F[1] is S2.diff_form_module(1).zero()
True
```

But now, I see your point. The restriction is called `zero` and this indicates that this **is** the immutable zero element, no matter what. The user should be aware of that.

But then, the `set_restriction` method is not useful anymore. It was introduced to facilitate things -- setting the restriction of all forms in just one command (for future implementations).

Any ideas how to solve this?

Once a differential form is established and ready for further use, it shall be considered as immutable, right? When a mixed form is fed by these forms, `set_restriction` alters the as immutable seen forms, which should not happen due to your consideration.

Perhaps it is better to implement a mixed form as an own independent algebraic object which should be initialized in a similar way as differential forms. The components must be set individually anyway. What do you think?

The point is that tensor field objects (including scalar fields and differential forms) are not immutable, except for the zero element. They cannot be made immutable because, in general, they cannot be fully defined at their creation: they are defined "on the fly" by adding some piece of information like

```
sage: s.add_expr(1+x, chart=X)
sage: t[0,1] = 1+x
```
for a scalar field `s` and a tensor field `t`.

Things are different for the zero elements: they are fully defined at their creation and they should be immutable. This is not enforced though, and we have currently the following garbage in / garbage out  bugs:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: zv = M.vector_field_module().zero()
sage: zv.display()
zero = 0
sage: zv[0] = 1 + x  # this should not be allowed!
sage: zv.display()
zero = (x + 1) d/dx
sage: zv is M.vector_field_module().zero()  # ouch!
True
sage: zs = M.scalar_field_algebra().zero()
sage: zs.display()
zero: M --> R
   (x, y) |--> 0
sage: zs.set_expr(1 + x)  # this should not be allowed!
sage: zs.display()
zero: M --> R
   (x, y) |--> x + 1
sage: zs is M.scalar_field_algebra().zero()  # ouch!
True
```
The natural way to enforce the immutability of the zero element would be to subclass the element class. Unfortunately, this turns out to be impossible in Sage's !Parent/Element framework, cf. this [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/tZW9T-AixBQ).


> However, I am not sure I understand why `set_restriction` is not useful anymore. What about if there are other forms?

`set_restriction` should handle properly the zero case: if some element is a zero element, then it should replace it by an ordinary object which equals to zero and apply the restriction to it, making it no longer equal to zero.

Certainly, a `set_restriction` method is way more user friendly and (in my opinion) preferrable -- especially, in order to make the behaviour of scalar fields and tensor fields more consistent. Furthermore, one can use `add_expr_by_continuation` in this case more effectively. 

The `display` method, as it is now in this ticket, can be very slow if the expressions are quite complicated. However, when the user wishes a short computation, he can choose a particular chart in which the caclulation should be done.

The algorithm I wrote starts from the top chart downwards and immediately stops if an expression is found. So, the computation time depends on how small the scalar field is split. Another approach would be, to display only *known* expressions and compute new expressions only if a particular chart is stated.

I can open a new ticket on this issue if you wish.

Adding extra information is not changing the element to me, it is still (suppose to be) representing the same, e.g., tensor field but with more information. Enforcing this is a near impossible task IMO, so we just assume good user input (as I think we should), which preserves the element. Since mathematically we have `x + 0 = x`, a user should not expect that mutating `x+0` is different than mutating `x`.

Also for the immutability of the zero, ever place you do something that mutates it, just add a check for the `_is_zero` and raise an error if you do mutate it since it is a special element.

The issues about scalar fields are mainly moved to ticket #28554. I guess, a whole new discussion arises there.

It's true that scalar fields and tensor fields (including differential forms) have been implemented in separate stages (cf. #18528) and have been subsequently modified in possible different ways.

The `_is_zero` attribute changes whenever a component is changed or `bool` is used. So, I'd prefer something like

```
if self is self._parent_zero:
    raise AssertionError("...")
```

Do you agree? I would do the same thing for the one element of scalar fields.

Nah. Certainly, this will not work! The zero element is altered by using the component manipulation methods. This will raise an immediate error. By the way, the same problem will arise when we use the `_is_zero` attribute and add a new chart.

Maybe, the zero element should be altered internally via the `_comp` attribute and any invokation of `add_comp`, `set_comp` etc. should be forbidden for this element. What do you say?

I would have written

```
if self is self.parent().zero():
    raise AssertionError("...")
```
Can you be more specific about the fact that this would not work?

Yes. In `tensorfield_module.py` the zero element is established by:

```
        resu = self._element_constructor_(name='zero', latex_name='0')
        for frame in self._domain._frames:
            if self._dest_map.restrict(frame._domain) == frame._dest_map:
                resu.add_comp(frame)
                # (since new components are initialized to zero)
```

But this raises an immediate error when using

```
if self is self.parent().zero():
    raise AssertionError("...")
```

in `add_comp`.

One can add the components from "behind". But using this method is contradictional in this case.

Thanks for provided example, with `add_comp` called on the zero element.

> Another idea would be, to move the preexisting code to an internal method called `_add_comp` and change everything internally with it. From outside then, you have to use the old `add_comp` method which ensures correct treatment and invokes `_add_comp` after some checking.

Another option would be to add the keyword argument `check=True` to `add_comp` and to use it as follows:

```
def add_comp(self, basis=None, check=True):
    if check and self is self.parent().zero():
        raise RuntimeError("...")
    ...
```
Then in internal code, like in the example of [comment:62](#comment%3A62), one could call `add_comp` with `check=False`. 

That said, I would propose to move the secure manipulation of the zero element to another ticket, possibly investigating further the option of introducing a specific subclass (this would avoid having `if self is self.parent().zero()` cases everywhere).

-**Mixed Forms** 
+There are too many changes going on at once, so that a merge in the end might be difficult. In order to avoid such difficulties and to keep an overview of things that are happening (for me and others), I use this ticket from now on as a metaticket, where all latest changes are merged together. Cross ticket references are possible.
 
-- readability of code improved in `mixed_form.py` and `mixed_form_algebra.py`
-- now, mixed form components are seen as immutable in the sense of the discussion below; as a result, the component setup is modified
-- now, the `display()` method shows **only** the expansion in a particular frame and chart
+This metaticket is mainly devoted to the topic of immutability of algebra elements (see discussion below).
 
-**Scalar Fields**
+**Things going on:**
 
-- ~~scalar field can be partially defined in one top chart domain, so the display method was misleading in this case. This is now fixed: the `display()` method shows *all* known expressions. For each such expression, the greatest domain, where this expression is known, is displayed~~ (moved to #28554).
-- ~~now, multiplication of named scalar fields `f` and `g` leads to `f \cdot g` in LaTeX code~~ (moved to #28554)
-- ~~division by zero in `_div_()` is now checked via `is_trivial_zero()`~~ (moved to #28554)
-
-** Differential Forms / Tensor Fields**
-
-- tensor algebra computations improved:
-  - in order to make computations faster, an attribute `_is_zero` is added and checked (similar to scalar fields)
-  - wedge product of differential forms with self leads to zero right away in case of odd order
-- multiplication of tensor fields `a` with scalar fields `f` yields name `f*a` and latex name `f \cdot a`
-
-**Various**
-
-- more consistency between scalar fields and tensor fields:
-  - a copy of scalar fields took the name from the original, a copy of tensor fields did not; now, a copy takes the name in any case (in moment of creation, the copy is the very same algebraic object)
-  - ~~method `set_restriction()` added to scalar fields~~ (moved to #28554)
-  - ~~coercion via restriction rearranged in scalar fields following tensor fields~~ (moved to #28554)
-- minor code rearrangements, i.e. for code reuse or consistency
-- `copy()` now inherits the attribute `_is_zero` from the original (both for tensor fields and scalar fields) to ensure better zero treatment
-- manipulation of the zero element raises an error
+- #28554: Scalar Field Restrictions
