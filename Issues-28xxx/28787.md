One may want to add/contract tensors with indices in the following way : 
 
`T["<sup>ijklm_m]+T["</sup>mklij_m"]`

This entails to implement 
* _get_item_ method 
* _set_item_ method 
* _add_ method
which all keep track of the indices names.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Thanks for providing this functionality! The code looks nice. 
However, as revealed by the [patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/28787/), there are a few minor issues:
- running `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_with_indices.py` reveals incomplete coverage
- `SymmetricGroup` is imported but not used
- there are invalid escape sequences in the lines 

```
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",con) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",cov) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
```
  Most probably, you should prefix the string `"[()\[\]]"` with `r` to make it a raw string. *Side remark:* the error message passed to exceptions should start with a lower case letter; so please change `"No symmetry allowed"` to `"no symmetry allowed"`
- Building the documentation via `sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html` yields some errors, two of them being related to the characters `\]` and `\[` above and should be fixed with the `r` prefix

Actually, the patchbot reports are to be taken with a grain of salt. A human eye has always to take a look. Apart from the `EXAMPLE:` case pointed by Frédéric (maybe in that case the patchbot error was triggered by `EXAMPLE:` not being followed by an empty line), another case is some spurious report of unused import (see e.g. [this example](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27865#comment:13)).

<a id='comment:49'></a>It looks good to me, except that the patchbot "blocks" plugin reports this [error](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/28787/Linux/1_SMP_Thu_Nov_14_17:32:43_UTC_2019/x86_64/4.14.152-127.182.amzn2.x86_64/unizaramazon2a/2020-01-13%2013:43:00?plugin=blocks&diff=/log/0/Linux/1_SMP_Thu_Nov_14_17%3A32%3A43_UTC_2019/x86_64/4.14.152-127.182.amzn2.x86_64/unizaramazon2a/2020-01-10%2003%3A55%3A52&ticket=28787&base=9.1.beta0). 
This plugin forbids "Returns" at the start of a new line, see rule no. 6 in line 581 of the [plugin source code](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/master/sage_patchbot/plugins.py). This is because, according to [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), *"The docstring is a phrase ending in a period. It prescribes the function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"), not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ..."*. So the doctstring of the method `_parse_indices` should start with "Parse", not "Parses", etc. Could you fix this please?
