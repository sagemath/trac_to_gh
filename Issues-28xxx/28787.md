One may want to add/contract tensors with indices in the following way : 
 
`T["<sup>ijklm_m]+T["</sup>mklij_m"]`

This entails to implement 
* `_get_item_` method 
* `_set_item_` method 
* `_add_` method
which all keep track of the indices names.

Thanks for providing this functionality! The code looks nice. 
However, as revealed by the [patchbot](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/28787/), there are a few minor issues:
- running `sage -coverage src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_with_indices.py` reveals incomplete coverage
- `SymmetricGroup` is imported but not used
- there are invalid escape sequences in the lines 

```
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",con) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
            if re.search("[()\[\]]",cov) is not None:
                raise ValueError("No symmetry allowed")
```
  Most probably, you should prefix the string `"[()\[\]]"` with `r` to make it a raw string. *Side remark:* the error message passed to exceptions should start with a lower case letter; so please change `"No symmetry allowed"` to `"no symmetry allowed"`
- Building the documentation via `sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html` yields some errors, two of them being related to the characters `\]` and `\[` above and should be fixed with the `r` prefix

I've performed some corrections to the docstrings, including that mentioned by FrÃ©dÃ©ric (comment:19). Now the documentation should build successfully.

Doctest lines after TESTS:: should be indented, as for EXAMPLES::

```

The patchbot plugins are not smart, but there is no simple way to make them smarter. When they give a red light, you should judge by yourself if there is an error or not.

On the contrary, I do appreciate the work that has been put into the review process of sagemath, which includes the patchbot. I feel that improving on the process (and the documentation) is improving sagemath on the long run.
