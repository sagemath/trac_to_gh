Actually, such information should be there whenever updating is non-trivial. I've certainly seen various packages like that (I don't recall which). Ideally, there shouldn't be such instructions, simply because the instructions are trivial ("just download the package from upstream.")

In this direction Julien Puydt has made a python script which when run (from the right place) creates the cremona.db file, and the plan is to include this script in with eclib.  Then there could be a Makefile target whose action is to create a new database_cremona_ellcurve spkg.

On the other hand I have no current plans for further expansion of the database (though make not promises not to).

1. Magma has had the new database since Aug.28, updated today Sept 12 (see http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/.
2. Pari/gp has the new database since today (see http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html).
3. The new curves are all in the LMFDB (see http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/).

And finally, not a single line of Sage code had to be changed.  So please!
