Instead, test that after installing this version of the spkg all of Sage still works, and (if you care) look at the output of CremonaDatabase() to see if it shows a number just under 500000 instead of 400000 with the old version.\n\n---\nNew commits:\n|                                                                                                                                          |               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n|[1cc6419](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1cc6419510d7a87cfbd3923d4686883987fa478d)|`trim SPKG.txt`|\n\n---\nNew commits:\n|                                                                                                                                          |               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n|[1cc6419](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1cc6419510d7a87cfbd3923d4686883987fa478d)|`trim SPKG.txt`|",

The content of SPKG.txt has always and forever been ignored by everybody.  I just updated it so that it bears some relation to what now actually works.  As far as I am concerned it could be deleted altogether: what other SPKG.txt files contain instructions on how to update the spkg?

Anyway I used Method 2 and will update the text accordingly, but I do *not* expect anyone reviewing this to test the spkg creation instructions.  Instead, test that after installing this version of the spkg all of Sage still works, and (if you care) look at the output of CremonaDatabase() to see if it shows a number just under 500000 instead of 400000 with the old version.

In this direction Julien Puydt has made a python script which when run (from the right place) creates the cremona.db file, and the plan is to include this script in with eclib.  Then there could be a Makefile target whose action is to create a new database_cremona_ellcurve spkg.

On the other hand I have no current plans for further expansion of the database (though make not promises not to).
