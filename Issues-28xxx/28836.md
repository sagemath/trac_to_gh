Jerry James is working on adding `shared_meataxe` to the Fedora Linux
distribution, for use by sagemath.

He noticed a potential buffer overflow problem and recommends a patch. While looking at the patch, I noticed that in addition to the potential buffer overflow, the function isn't propagating error return values.

So, as upstream of SharedMeatAxe, I will soon(TM) create a new version, and this ticket is about including the new version into sagemath.

In addition, I wouldn't mind to make meataxe a standard package. After all, matrix arithmetic over finite non-prime fields is still very under-performant in sagemath.

Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

Component: **packages: optional**
