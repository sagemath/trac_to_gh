This is something that's been discussed before but I don't think there's a ticket for it.

Python 3 allows unicode word-constituent characters to be used in identifiers, https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers, subject to NFKC normalization.  So we can easily provide unicode aliases for some common functions and constants named and denoted by Greek letters.

In Python 3 / IPython it is also possible to do tab-completion for many unicode characters: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.completer.html#latex-and-unicode-completion
(This list can easily be expanded by modifying the dict in `IPython.completer.latex_symbols`.)

Due to identifier normalization, these four identifiers are actually the same as their ASCII equivalents. For example:

```
sage: Q = 42
sage: ℚ
42
```
