This is a follow-up to #28408, #27521 and #26984. Building the html docs for sage-8.9 with python3 I have the following `DeprecationWarnings`:

```
[repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
[combinat ] <unknown>:265: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[combinat ] <unknown>:1274: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \G
```

```
def assemble_logical_lines():

Adding `r` to the start of the triple quotes fixes the problem with `\)`.

Line 365:

```
    cellmagic_help_re = re.compile('%%\w+\?')
```
This is in Python code, so I don't know why it causes any problems, but prefixing this quote with `r` fixes the problem with `\w`.

The ipython-7.5.0 that's available on Gentoo has these corrections.
