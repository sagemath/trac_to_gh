This is a follow-up to #28408, #27521 and #26984. Building the html docs for sage-8.9 with python3 I have the following `DeprecationWarnings`:

```
[repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
[combinat ] <unknown>:265: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[combinat ] <unknown>:1274: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \G
```

Keywords: **python3**

Got it! The problem comes from `IPython.core.inputtransformer`, which is imported in `sage.repl.interpreter`. Lines 180-181:

```
def assemble_logical_lines():
    """Join lines following explicit line continuations (\)"""
```
Adding `r` to the start of the triple quotes fixes the problem with `\)`.

Line 365:

```
    cellmagic_help_re = re.compile('%%\w+\?')
```
This is in Python code, so I don't know why it causes any problems, but prefixing this quote with `r` fixes the problem with `\w`.

The bad news is that this file is part of IPython and so is not under our control. The good news is that we should update to a new version of IPython soon (#28197), and presumably these are fixed there. This update may be Python 3 only, but see #28190. In any case, I suggest ignoring these two issues and fixing the two in `combinat`.

The ipython-7.5.0 that's available on Gentoo has these corrections.
