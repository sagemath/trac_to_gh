The backend `field` have the following bug:

```
sage: Polyhedron(lines=[[1]], backend='field')
The empty polyhedron in QQ^1
```

This is fixed by fixing #17339. We add a doctest verifying the fix.

Depends on #17339

It seems to be related to #17339.

When one tries to fix this, the verification that checks

```
Polyhedron(ieqs=[], ambient_dim=1) == Polyhedron(lines=[[1]])
```
in the class `Hrep2Vrep` in `double_description_inhomogeneous.py` will fail.
