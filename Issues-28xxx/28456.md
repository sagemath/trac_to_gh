Fix `TypeError: 'filter' object is not subscriptable` when GAP_ROOT_DIR doesn't exist.

On sage-the-distro GAP_ROOT_DIR points to an existing dir, so this code path is not being doctested.

Why not get rid of the `filter` command altogether? Use 

```
[x for x in gap_sh if x.strip().startswith('GAP_ROOT')][0]
```
instead? Or this should be faster since we can stop after the first match:

```
next(x for x in gap_sh if x.strip().startswith('GAP_ROOT'))
```
