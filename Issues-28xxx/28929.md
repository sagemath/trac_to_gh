`HyperbolicGeodesic.plot()` doesn't always return an object of type `sage.plot.graphics.Graphics`:

```
sage: g = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(0, Infinity)
sage: g.plot(boundary=False) == None
True
```

In particular, no plot is shown. This only seems to happen if `g` is a line and `boundary=False`. One look at the source show that this is caused by an incorrect indentation:
