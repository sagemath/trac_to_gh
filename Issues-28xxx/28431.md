This appears to be a maxima related error.

```
integrate(1/(a-b),a)
```
 => log(a-b), which is correct

```
integrate(1/(a-c*b),a)
```
 => log(c*b-a), which is *incorrect*.

```
Sympy.integrate(1/(a-c*b),a)
=> log(a-c*b), which is correct.
``` 

As SymPy does this correctly can we get a quick fix by rerouting 1/x type integrals through SymPy? I am not familiar with the details of the backend translation used by the integrate function.

I assume this should also be reported upstream, but I do not know how to verify that it really is an upstream error.

Keywords: integration, 1/x, maxima

I believe I have isolated this to maxima or how Sage is using it.

Incorrect:

```
>integrate(1/(a-b*n),a, algorithm='maxima')
log(b*n - a)
```

Correct:

```
>integrate(1/(a-b*n),a, algorithm='sympy')
log(-b*n + a)
```

The problem may be with our translation from `maxima`, which, by itself, behaves correctly:

```

(%i1) integrate(1/(a-b*c),a);
(%o1)                            log(a - b c)
```
which is **correct**. And, BTW:

```
(%i5) diff(integrate(1/(a-b*c),a),a);

(%o5) 1/(a-b*c)
```
also correct.

**EDIT :** This is **not** yet another effect of `domain:complex`:

```
(%i7) domain:complex;              

(%o7) complex
(%i8) integrate(1/(a-b*c),a);

(%o8) log(a-b*c)
```
which is again correct...

Furthermore:

```
sage: var("a, b, c")
(a, b, c)
sage: integrate(1/(a-c*b),a)
log(b*c - a)                           /* Wrong */
sage: integrate(1/(a-c*b),a).diff(a)
-1/(b*c - a)                           /* CORRECT ??? */
```

Two wrongs make one right ??? 

This is, IMHO, a seemingly innocuous sign of a serious problem in a basic ability. I raise the priority to `critical`.

I think the simplification

```
sage: 1/(a-b*c)
-1/(b*c - a)
```
explains this. In maxima:

```
(%i1) integrate( -1/(b*c-a), a);
(%o1)                            log(b c - a)
```
We're not doing anything wrong. It's really down to branch choice. (having `log(abs(x-a))` as antiderivative doesn't play nice with complex analytic computations)
Furthermore,

```
sage: log(b*c-a).diff(a)
-1/(b*c - a)
```
is just correct.

This is just us using a monomial ordering and a normalization of rational functions that leads maxima to choosing a branch for an antiderivative that doesn't match what you might expect to be chosen naively.

Nope. Whereas

```
sage: with assuming (x, "real", a, "real"): (log(abs(x-a))).diff(x)
-1/(a - x)
```

In general, 

```
sage: (log(abs(x-a))).diff(x)
-1/2*(a - x + conjugate(a) - conjugate(x))/abs(-a + x)^2
```

> because for `x < a` the expression `log(x-a)` doesn't make much sense, does it?


It [does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm#Complex_logarithm). In the complex plane, and at the cost of choosing one among an infinity of solutions (branch choice).

Seen another way, the //definite// integral `integrate(x-a),x,b, c`} does make sense, and can be  trivially computed (use the change of variable t=x-a), **except** if a+b<0 //and// a+c>0 : the function can't be integrated in x==a, and the integration constant has absolutely no reason to be the same on the two sides of this discontinuity. If you suppose that the two integration constants are the same, you obtain a [Cauchy principal value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_principal_value), which is **not** a value of the integral.

This is //another// (Maxima's) error.

> We're not doing anything wrong.


So, why are we obtaining the //opposite// of the expected result (which is //correctly// given by Maxima) //in the original case// ?

Because //we// are passing a "simplified" operand, which sends us in Maxima's trap.

Not our fault ?

> It's really down to branch choice. (having `log(abs(x-a))` as antiderivative doesn't play nice with complex analytic computations)


Nope : unless I'm sorely mistaken (which is always possible), a branch choice problem would leave us with a constant (pure imaginary in this case, I believe)  added to the correct value, //not// its opposite...

Most of Sage's (and Maxima's) symbolic functions aim to play with complexes. Roughly speaking, they assume that SR element are complexes. Hence the difference in x.log().abs().diff() with and without assumptions about x...

For example:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ,"x")(x^2+1).is_irreducible()
True
sage: PolynomialRing(QQbar,"x")(x^2+1).is_irreducible()
False
sage: PolynomialRing(SR,"x")(x^2+1).is_irreducible()
False
```

But note that:

```
sage: (x^2+1).is_irreducible()

[ Snip ... ]

AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no attribute 'is_irreducible'
```

So these rules are not cast in stone...

Damn... You're right !

I stand corrected.

But still:

```
sage: with assuming(a, "real", b, "real", c, "real"): (1/(a - b*c)).integrate(a)
log(b*c - a)
```
is hard to swallow... Choosing `I*pi` as an integration constant in a problem involving real quantities is a stretch of imagination...

But that's a nice excuse for any undergrad committing an error of sign in an integration problem. Which, BTW, won't hold in the case of //definite// integration.

It doesn't. This is exactly what integration constants express. You'd have to give an uncountable set of antiderivatives.

Duh! Of course, it doesn't generalize. I get my dunce hat for this one!

I am beginning to lean towards some kind of "domain" control as discussed on sage-devel. I can see `algorithm='maxima_real' or 'sympy_real'` as easy to use. The default should remain the complex domain. To facilitate usability by people like me (physical scientists and their students) the default domain needs to be stated up-front in the documentation for integrate.

As was discussed in the sage-devel thread, I am not clear this solves all the issues. However, it ought to help with the issue of log in the real domain requiring a positive real number input. I would expect it to trigger an error requiring an assumption about whether a > b or not.
