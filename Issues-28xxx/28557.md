The algorithm for julia_plot (and fast_julia_plot) erroneously assumes that if |z| > 2, then z is not in the Julia set of the function f(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c, because the orbit of z is unbounded under iteration of f(z). (To see that this is not always true, let c = -6. Then z = 3 is a fixed point, so its orbit is obviously not unbounded.) Looking on the bright side, the algorithm does give correct results whenever |c| <= 2 (which includes all points in the Mandelbrot set), so most users will never see a problem.

To fix this, the bound 2 should be replaced with an appropriate bound R that depends on c. By the quadratic formula, the largest (positive) fixed point of the function f*(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - |c| is R = (1 + sqrt(1 + 4|c|))/2. It is then easy to see that f*(x) > x for x > R. Then, by the triangle inequality, we have |z<sup>2</sup> + c| > |z| whenever |z| > R. So the orbit of z tends to infinity whenever |z| is greater than this value R.

I have uploaded a PR that replaces 2 with this value of R, but I have not done this before, and I apologize if I goofed up anything about this ticket.

Ok, thank you. This change looks correct to me. Just in the documentation of `julia_plot`, I think you accidentally defined `R_c` as the square of the intended value. I changed it to `\bigl(1 + \sqrt{1 + 4|c|}\bigr)/2` as you explained in the ticket description. Is this correct?

I fixed two minor pyflakes complaints in mandel_julia.py. (`DynamicalSystem` was imported twice, and `QQ` was imported but never used.) I am happy with the state of this patch, and I recommend a positive review if the patchbots are green.

However, I also think that `julia_plot` needs further work, as explained in the new metaticket #28923 (which tracks this ticket).

@mwageringel : Thanks again for your help with this ticket.
