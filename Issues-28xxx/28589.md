On some configs, `OpenGL` is not supported, and `threejs` relies on it. Since it is now the default 3d viewer, nothing will be drawn when trying to plot 3d objects: there should be some fallback to `jmol` when such case appears.

**Keywords:** threejs

Three.js more precisely uses WebGL, which is [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) in all major browsers. If someone is using a browser so old that it does not support WebGL, they should be told to upgrade that massive security risk.

Detection of WebGL capability occurs in the browser, so there could be no automatic fallback once the process is handed off to the browser. At most we could display an error message, but I highly doubt even that will be necessary.
