<a id='comment:10'></a>Hello !

What is the difference with the existing Chow ring (in `src/sage/schemes/toric/chow_group.py`) ? Are there cases where they are the same and cases where they are not ?

One general remark: it would be much better if what you define would be recognized as a ring by sage. This means that it should become a Parent class, and have an associated Element class. There are some tutorials on how to do that, but you can also look at existing examples.

Travis, would you have a good suggestion for a place to learn about `Parent / Element` ?

Basic remark: the first line in doc of every function should use "imperative" mode, so should contain "Return" (as an order) and not "Returns", and the same for other verbs.

So from a quick look at the code, it seems like it should be a subclass of `CombinatorialFreeModule`. So these tutorials would be relevant:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.html
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-implementing-algebraic-structures.html
- (shameless plug for my notebook with code showing how to construct new algebras) https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/TravisScrimshaw/sage_notebooks/sagedays_109_talk.ipynb

This is also a very generic but useful tutorial:

- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html

These are all the ones I can think of right now.
