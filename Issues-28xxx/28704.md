As reported in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/48658/possible-bug-in-_cmp_-function/ `cmp` is inconsistent for p-adics, i.e., `a<b` does not imply `b>a`. While ordering p-adics has no deep meaning, it should at least be consistent.

The problem seems to be in `ccmp` doing the following

```
    mpz_sub(holder.value, a, b)
    mpz_mod(holder.value, holder.value, prime_pow.pow_mpz_t_tmp(prec))
    return mpz_sgn(holder.value)
```

But mpz_mod is always non-negative.
