`CombinatorialPolyhedron` computes the `f_vector` much faster than the current algorithm. In addition it is very memory efficient.

The goal of this ticket is to replace the method in `Polyhedron_base` by the method in `CombinatorialPolyedron`.

Here is a tiny example of the comparison:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
sage: _ = P.incidence_matrix()
sage: a = get_memory_usage()
sage: %time P.f_vector()
CPU times: user 8.19 s, sys: 4.46 ms, total: 8.19 s
Wall time: 8.19 s
(1, 720, 1800, 1560, 540, 62, 1)
sage: get_memory_usage(a)
22.84765625
sage: a = get_memory_usage()
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
sage: %time C.f_vector()
CPU times: user 889 µs, sys: 14 µs, total: 903 µs
Wall time: 905 µs
(1, 720, 1800, 1560, 540, 62, 1)
sage: get_memory_usage(a)
0.81640625
```

Just a comment. I have no idea where this was added due to the 1000 tickets:

```
raise ValueError("not all facets are joins of vertices")
```

This error message is very misleading. I would change this to something that does not use the word join. Usually, facet are convex hulls of vertices. Is this what fails here? If yes, then I would change it to that.

`give an error message for polytopes in some cases; removed incorrect example`

It's an error message that was generated in `CombinatorialPolyhedron`. Convex hull isn't really defined there. But I guess people get what it means.

Its a lot better than what we used to get. This was a very cryptic `KeyError` in hasse diagram and it took me a while to figure out what the error message is supposed to tell us.

If you think it should be changed now, you can put this ticket, #28605, #28606 and #28614 on needs work, because there will be merge conflicts. Otherwise, we can always fix this later.

Please let the positively reviewed tickets get into a beta before trying to shove them all at once. It's simply impossible to review otherwise.

I agree that it is a bit confusing. This ticket here has a total number of 7 commits and three of them belong to #28621 and #28607. I think this is doable.

As this ticket and #28605 conflict, we need to make one depend on the other. I just figured that this here is easier than #28605.
