```
You can't create morphisms from power series rings to p-adic rings when you should be able to:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: A = Zp(5)
sage: R.hom([A(5)])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: relations do not all (canonically) map to 0 under map determined by images of generators
```
Moreover, you can evaluate power series on p-adic elements even when the result is not well defined:

```
sage: f = (x + x^4 + O(x^9))
sage: f(A(5)) # this is fine
5 + 5^4 + O(5^9)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: f = (x + x^4 + O(x^9))
sage: f(A(5)) # this is not
5 + 5^4 + O(5^9)
```
