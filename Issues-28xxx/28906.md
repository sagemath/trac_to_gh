`libpng.pc, gdlib.pc, zlib.pc`etc
are needed in the calls of `pkgconfig.parse` in `src/module_list.py`


some perfectly fine implementations of `zlib` etc. don't install `zlib.pc` etc. (e.g. MacOS does not).

Since #26286 this problem was sleeping, until we updated `pkgconfig` on #28883, which made it throw an error on absense of `zlib.pc`.

This ticket provides generation of `zlib.pc` and `libpng.pc`, among with some fly-by refactoring.

The biggest question I here is how to find the full path to `libz` located by `AC_CHECK_LIB` or other similar macro.
This path has to be written into `zlib.pc`.

I don't quite know: I can link an executable with libz and analyse it with
`readelf` or `otool` or a similar thing, but it's not platform independent,
and I could not find a ready-made macro (I could change `AC_CHECK_LIB`, sure...)

well, a minimal pkgconfig like this would be just a bug in waiting to bite.

I can think of one platform-independent way (well, it needs [dladdr](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dladdr), which is non-POSIX, but BSD, something that is available on most Unices, certainly on Linux and MacOS)

Write a C function that calls `dlopen()` on the library in question, and then
calls `dladdr()` on a symbol from the library; one of parts of the returned data is the full path to the shared object where the symbol is located.
That's a hell of a macro call to `AC_RUN_IFELSE` though :-)

This branch is so far only for zlib.pc

Any obvious things I missed?

Naturally, I'd appreciate it tested on MacOS.

For libpng.pc I'll probably refactor that, to make computing abstolute path to libpng/libz/libWhatever a macro.

Would it though?  Why exactly do we *require* pkgconfig here at all?  It's a convenience sure, but on systems that don't install .pc files for some libraries we can still get the required information another way...

I am thinking of a library trying to detect zlib by calling pkg-config rather than 
using autoconf. 

IMHO it's better not to install a pc file at all rather than install a rather bogus one. That's why I prefer how it's done on #28883.
