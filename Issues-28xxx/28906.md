`libpng.pc, gdlib.pc, zlib.pc`etc
are needed in the calls of `pkgconfig.parse` in `src/module_list.py`


some perfectly fine implementations of `zlib` etc. don't install `zlib.pc` etc. (e.g. MacOS does not).

Since #26286 this problem was sleeping, until we updated `pkgconfig` on #28883, which made it throw an error on absense of `zlib.pc`.

This ticket provides generation of `zlib.pc` and `libpng.pc`, among with some fly-by refactoring.

The biggest question I here is how to find the full path to `libz` located by `AC_CHECK_LIB` or other similar macro.
This path has to be written into `zlib.pc`.

I don't quite know: I can link an executable with libz and analyse it with
`readelf` or `otool` or a similar thing, but it's not platform independent,
and I could not find a ready-made macro (I could change `AC_CHECK_LIB`, sure...)

well, a minimal pkgconfig like this would be just a bug in waiting to bite.

I can think of one platform-independent way (well, it needs [dladdr](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dladdr), which is non-POSIX, but BSD, something that is available on most Unices, certainly on Linux and MacOS)

Write a C function that calls `dlopen()` on the library in question, and then
calls `dladdr()` on a symbol from the library; one of parts of the returned data is the full path to the shared object where the symbol is located.
That's a hell of a macro call to `AC_RUN_IFELSE` though :-)

This branch is so far only for zlib.pc

Any obvious things I missed?

Naturally, I'd appreciate it tested on MacOS.

For libpng.pc I'll probably refactor that, to make computing abstolute path to libpng/libz/libWhatever a macro.

Would it though?  Why exactly do we *require* pkgconfig here at all?  It's a convenience sure, but on systems that don't install .pc files for some libraries we can still get the required information another way...

All that should be needed to link against that library are whatever compiler/linker flags (e.g. `-lz`) that autoconf used to detect usability of the library in the first place.

I am thinking of a library trying to detect zlib by calling pkg-config rather than 
using autoconf. 

IMHO it's better not to install a pc file at all rather than install a rather bogus one. That's why I prefer how it's done on #28883.
