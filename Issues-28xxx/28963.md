There are some lacks in the documentation.

- the vector bundle stated as "Möbius bundle" is actually no Möbius bundle (the transition function is wrong)
- the frames induced by trivializations are denoted by `(psi^*e_i)`. This is not standard notation and should therefore be explained.
- references added
