This is a follow-up to #27681 which is now closed, as it fixed one issue related to libgap and pexpect gap possibly interacting in bad ways.

However, the original issue, which for a while I could not reproduce, seems to be coming up again.  For example if I run just:

```
$ ./sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
```

I get

```
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

```

There is something about `sage.combinat.tableau` that the problem is always occurring there, though I'm not sure why.  It's usually crashing on the same tests, but not always with the exact same traceback, suggesting some pseudo-deterministic memory corruption.

On #27681 it was reported that the error doesn't occur when running the tests with `--serial`, but my experience is different.  I still get:

Since this is a pretty random issue, it possible that running with `--serial` just happened to make it go away in their case.

While running the tests, libgap reserves initially what amounts to `virtual_memory_limit() // 10`, or only 330 MB, but the 2 GB I mentioned previously doesn't even include libgap.

I wonder, if nothing else, as long as we're capping the virtual memory limit for doctests, the default amount reserved for Pari should be lower.

One little thing we can do that happens to be good-enough for this case, it seems, is to further limit the amount of workspace Pari allocates by default, just when running the test suite.

Since many tests won't require that much memory for Pari this seems sensible.

In the case of this particular test the other issue is just reducing the amount of memory used when instantiating large Tableaux classes.  I have opened #28114 for that.

hmm, but it is fast (for me, on Debian 10):

```
sage: timeit("StandardTableaux(50).cardinality()")
5 loops, best of 3: 169 μs per loop
```
It is not constructing this huge set for sure...

Which is the point of this doctest, the set is huge and it is using an actual computation. However, `StandardPartitions` does need to compute the partitions of 50 as part of the `__init__` as part of this line:

```
Family(Partitions_n(n), StandardTableaux_shape),
```
Now the `Family` is created lazily; however, this gets expanded by the call `self._facade_for = tuple(family)` in the `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__init__`. So we construct a set of size

```
sage: Partitions(50).cardinality()
204226
```
instead of

```
sage: ST = StandardTableaux(50)
sage: ST.cardinality()
27886995605342342839104615869259776
```
Now unfortunately I do not see a simple way to keep that family done lazily. However, changing it to 40 should still do an appropriate test but uses far less memory:

```
sage: Partitions(40).cardinality()
37338
sage: StandardTableaux(40).cardinality()
72682301192087742711233536
```

Yes, the fact that the doctest framework, by default, puts a low cap on virtual memory allocation allowed by the process, which would not normally be the case unless the user is manually setting those limits.

Therefore the large vmem allocation normally allowed for PARI's initial stack needs to be scaled back that much more when running the doctests in order to leave room for other things.

Now there are several doctest failures as a result of the reduced Pari stack size, see the patchbot, so I am setting back to needs work. I have only had a brief look, but some of them seem hard to solve.

Also, considering that relying on a specific load order could be a bit fragile, would it be possible to add a doctest or an assertion to check that Pari is loaded after `DOCTEST_MODE` is set?

I added that limit. My main motivation was to prevent accidents where Sage doctests would trash a machine by using all memory (that happened to me multiple times). The limit of 3300 MB was simply chosen as the smallest number that made all doctests pass at the time when that limit was imposed.

It just doesn't seem "fair", in a sense, that we impose a default hard limit on virtual memory allocation, and then have a large chunk of that eaten up by Pari, even when most of it isn't needed for most other tests.

When Pari runs out of memory isn't there some way to "catch" that, increase its stack, and re-try the operation?  Perhaps tests/code that are expected to eat up the Pari stack should actually explicitly do that (it would be good to test that anyways).

This isn't about fairness, it's about solving a practical problem, namely preventing excessive memory usage by doctests.

Sure, it probably could be done, but why bother? It's much easier to just allocate a large virtual stack. I just don't see the problem with that.

That's what I'm talking about: Normally it's fine to just allocate a large stack for PARI. But RLIMIT_AS limits the amount of virtual address space available to the process, and a large chunk of that gets used, without exception, for the PARI stack even for tests that don't need it so much, thus creating stricter limitations on what those tests are allowed to do.  This is what I mean by "fair".

Why aren't we just doing the obvious thing and increasing the limit from 3300MB to 3400MB? There is nothing magical about that 3300MB limit, it's mostly an arbitrary number.

Sure, I obviously wouldn't mind increasing the limit.  I just wonder how sustainable that is.  Perhaps a few more tests should be marked `# optional - memlimit` if this becomes a frequent problem.

It also makes me wonder if there aren't memory leaks that should be investigated.
