This is a follow-up to #27681 which is now closed, as it fixed one issue related to libgap and pexpect gap possibly interacting in bad ways.

However, the original issue, which for a while I could not reproduce, seems to be coming up again.  For example if I run just:

```
$ ./sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
```

I get

```
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

```

There is something about `sage.combinat.tableau` that the problem is always occurring there, though I'm not sure why.  It's usually crashing on the same tests, but not always with the exact same traceback, suggesting some pseudo-deterministic memory corruption.

On #27681 it was reported that the error doesn't occur when running the tests with `--serial`, but my experience is different.  I still get:

Since this is a pretty random issue, it possible that running with `--serial` just happened to make it go away in their case.

While running the tests, libgap reserves initially what amounts to `virtual_memory_limit() // 10`, or only 330 MB, but the 2 GB I mentioned previously doesn't even include libgap.

I wonder, if nothing else, as long as we're capping the virtual memory limit for doctests, the default amount reserved for Pari should be lower.

One little thing we can do that happens to be good-enough for this case, it seems, is to further limit the amount of workspace Pari allocates by default, just when running the test suite.

Since many tests won't require that much memory for Pari this seems sensible.

In the case of this particular test the other issue is just reducing the amount of memory used when instantiating large Tableaux classes.  I have opened #28114 for that.

hmm, but it is fast (for me, on Debian 10):

Which is the point of this doctest, the set is huge and it is using an actual computation. However, `StandardPartitions` does need to compute the partitions of 50 as part of the `__init__` as part of this line:

```
Family(Partitions_n(n), StandardTableaux_shape),
```
Now the `Family` is created lazily; however, this gets expanded by the call `self._facade_for = tuple(family)` in the `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__init__`. So we construct a set of size

```
sage: Partitions(50).cardinality()
204226
```
instead of

```
sage: ST = StandardTableaux(50)
sage: ST.cardinality()
27886995605342342839104615869259776
```
Now unfortunately I do not see a simple way to keep that family done lazily. However, changing it to 40 should still do an appropriate test but uses far less memory:

```
sage: Partitions(40).cardinality()
37338
sage: StandardTableaux(40).cardinality()
72682301192087742711233536
```

Please do so. Be aware, a lazy family may not know if it finite or not (a priori, I haven't checked this is actually true in the code). So that part might end up being more of a can of worms, but I don't know until someone actually does it.

Yes, the fact that the doctest framework, by default, puts a low cap on virtual memory allocation allowed by the process, which would not normally be the case unless the user is manually setting those limits.

Therefore the large vmem allocation normally allowed for PARI's initial stack needs to be scaled back that much more when running the doctests in order to leave room for other things.

It just doesn't seem "fair", in a sense, that we impose a default hard limit on virtual memory allocation, and then have a large chunk of that eaten up by Pari, even when most of it isn't needed for most other tests.

When Pari runs out of memory isn't there some way to "catch" that, increase its stack, and re-try the operation?  Perhaps tests/code that are expected to eat up the Pari stack should actually explicitly do that (it would be good to test that anyways).
