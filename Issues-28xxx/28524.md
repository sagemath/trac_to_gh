This ticket fixes a syntax error that occurs when `_sage_src_()` returns a string that does not contain parentheses.

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def __call__(self):
....:         return None
....:     def _sage_src_(self):
....:         return ''
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f?
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: The given string does not contain balanced parentheses

sage: f??
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: The given string does not contain balanced parentheses
```
