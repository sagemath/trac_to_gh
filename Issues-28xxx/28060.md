The following gives me a map from GF(5<sup>2</sup>) to GF(5<sup>6</sup>) but the following leads users to believe that we can't invert it:

```
    sage: k.<a> = GF(5^2)
    sage: K, f = k.extension(3, map=True)
    sage: f(a) in K
    True
    sage: f.inverse_image(f(a))
    AttributeError:
    ...
    NotImplementedError
```

However, the method `f.section()` provides the (partial) inverse map, and so the user should just have written `f.section()(a)`. I'm sure many users do not know that "section" means "the partial inverse map".

This ticket implements the trivial body `f.inverse_image()` so the user does not need to know this.

For usability, I find it very strange that `f.inverse_image(f(a))` does not return `a`, but rather throws a `NotImplementedException`. I'm posting a patch that makes `inverse_image` behave like this.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hi Johan, I have two very minor comments: 

1. There is a typo `methid` instead of `method` in the documentation.
2. ``self.section()`` and ``b`` should have double backticks.

Otherwise, LGTM.
