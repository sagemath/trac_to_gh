Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A18):
> * why all these changes to quadratic forms ?

The test for Lorentzian polynomials implemented in this ticket uses quadratic forms associated with homogeneous quadratic polynomials.  However, there is currently no built-in constructor for Sage's quadratic forms using this input, so we added another case to `QuadraticForm.__init__` to detect polynomials of this type.  Let me know if you think this should be handled in a different way.

<a id='comment:32'>Comment 32:</a>
The new references have arxiv links, which is good.
Both have since appeared:

- https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1454.52013
- https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A7542930

so journal references have been added.

There are still some doctest errors.

<a id='comment:34'>Comment 34:</a>
The method was broken for the case of one-variable "multivariate"
polynomials, since the multivariate implementation assumed that
multivariate polynomials were on more than one variable.

This was revealed by testing after the refactoring in commit d412a84
that replaced the specific implementation for univariate polynomials
by a call to the multivariate method instead.

I'm happy with the state of this ticket. Please review my changes.
