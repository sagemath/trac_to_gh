We add `spkg-configure` for the optional package `cbc`.

Because `OptionalExtension` does not know about packages found by spkg-configure (see #25828), this is only useful on top of #28175.

Sage's cbc lists quite a few dependencies (readline zlib bzip2 $(BLAS)) , but none are checked by spkg-configure, whereas they are really there, as may be seen on Debian by running

```
ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libCbc.so.3
```

It seems that cbc.pc file is lacking in this sense (along with its dependencies, it seems they don't bother with anything that is external to , they really should list them - should it be reported to upstream?

Anyhow, we should write these deps out, as it's done in e.g. gsl's ticket #28879

```m4
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([cbc], [
  SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([atlas openblas zlib bzip2], [
    dnl  checking with pkg-config
    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CBC], [cbc >= 2.9.4], [], [sage_spkg_install_cbc=yes])
  ])
])
```

Perhaps we should update the copy of cbc.pc, to include all these deps
(more precisely, all but altlas) in the `Requires:` field.

I guess their rationale for dependencies in *.pc files is that they don't assume that 
`blas lapack zlib bzip2` (I scratched `readline` out, it's actually not a dependence)
have *.pc files. Which is fair enough.

I've listed this ticket in #27330.

By the way, to move #27870  forward please review its dependence, #28883
