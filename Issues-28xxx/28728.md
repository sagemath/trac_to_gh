That fixed it: the test suite passes.

In other news, the test suite appears fragile in other ways: I just ran tests on another OS X machine (10.15), and no files `testinstall/*` which come alphabetically after `intarith.tst` were tested: the testing stopped after `intarith.tst`. In particular, it didn't test the file `strings.tst`, which was problematic on the first machine.
