Following shows picture but when you click it, it changes to a cloud of points. 

```
Example306(x,y) = -x*y*exp(-(x^2 + y^2)/2)
p1 = plot3d(Example306(x,y),(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2))
p2 = point((0,0,Example306(0,0)),size=20,color='red')
p3 = point((1,-1,Example306(1,-1)),size=20,color='green')
p4 = point((-1,1,Example306(1,-1)),size=20,color='green')
p5 = point((1,1,Example306(1,1)),size=20,color='black')
p6 = point((-1,-1,Example306(-1,-1)),size=20,color='black')
show(p1+p2+p3+p4+p5+p6, viewer='jsmol')
```

With `viewer='threejs'` it works.

On a fresh install 1) I was not able to open SageNB at all, and 2) `viewer='jsmol'` says `.../local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:583: UserWarning: viewer=jsmol is not supported`.

Something strange here.

The viewer should be `jmol`, not `jsmol`. With the former there is no error in the current notebook. I do remember seeing the error when first reported, but it's not there now.
