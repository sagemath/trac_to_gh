Since #25091 is merged, we can compute a few more things with normaliz. One important object is the so-called `h^*`-vector, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrhart_polynomial#Ehrhart_series for details.

This ticket implements this method. Currently, one has to do the following:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(3, backend="normaliz")
sage: C.ehrhart_series().numerator().coefficients()
[1, 23, 23, 1]
```

which would now become:

```
sage: C.h_star_vector()
```

and return an error if the backend is not `'normaliz'`...

See the related SageAsk question: https://ask.sagemath.org/question/32505/can-sage-compute-the-h-vector-of-a-polytope/

Eventually, it would be nice to also make this possible for polymake too (it would be interesting to know if they use `'normaliz'` for that).

For the h<sup>*</sup>-vector o be well-defined, the polytope should have integral vertices. Otherwise there is no canonical choice for the denominator and, hence, the numerator of the Ehrhart series (as a rational function).

At least one should check that the denominator is a power of 1-t.

A few comments:

```diff

+ - ``self`` -- A lattice polytope with ``backend`` = 'normaliz'.
```

I would put the backend comment in a NOTE environment, although I am not completely sure. It would be to be checked in the guidelines.

Just a suggestion:

```diff
- The h*-vector as a list.
+ A list whose entries give the h*-vector.
```

- `simplicies` -> `simplices`

In the examples, you are only testing one of the 4 and not the four of them.

The method `_h_star_vector_normaliz(self)` in base should return a `TypeError` (as the volume_normaliz for example) and the function in backend_normaliz should be appended with `_normaliz`.

I would also add a less trivial example, like the 0,1 cube and perhaps hypersimplex? This would be good to get sanity checks. Further, I would include an example that uses a different backend to show even further that it requires normaliz...

Otherwise, looks good!

It seems there is a merge conflict... Rebase?

In the `h_star_vector` function, I would not say

```diff
+        - ``self`` -- A lattice polytope with ``backend`` = 'normaliz'.
```

but use a NOTE to say that the backend should be normaliz.

Once we have the ticket #28880 and follow-up related to double description in normaliz, it will be possible to ignore the backend and simply obtain the relevant information in order to obtain the h_star_vector using normaliz.

The syntax for math printing should be corrected in:

```diff
+        The h*-vector of a unimodular simplex S (a simplex with 
-        volume = $\frac{1}{dim(S)!} ) is always 1. Here we test this on 
-        simplicies up to dimension 4:
+        volume = `\frac{1}{(\dim S)!}`) is always 1. Here we test this on 
+        simplices up to dimension 4::
```

Only one of the simplices is tested below:

```diff
+            sage: s1 = polytopes.simplex(1,backend = 'normaliz')
+            sage: s2 = polytopes.simplex(2,backend = 'normaliz')
+            sage: s3 = polytopes.simplex(3,backend = 'normaliz')
+            sage: s4 = polytopes.simplex(4,backend = 'normaliz')
+            sage: s3.h_star_vector()
+            [1]        
```

Why not something like:

```
sage: [polytopes.simplex(i,backend='normaliz').h_star_vector() for i in [1,2,3,4]]
sage: [[1], [1], [1], [1]]
```

The function `_h_star_vector` in `backend_normaliz.py` should be renamed `_h_star_vector_normaliz` and the function `_h_star_vector_normaliz` in `base.py` should return `raise TypeError("the backend should be normaliz")`.

I would also add some more examples that involve known examples where values can be relevant to check the validity.

I see. Great!

I only looked at the first commit and started writing. Since there's a merge conflict, I couldn't see the final product.

Ok, so now it would need a rebase in any case.

- There are no doctests in the function `_h_star_vector_normaliz` in `backend_normaliz.py`.

  - The documentation does not build:
   
   [dochtml] docstring of sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.h_star_vector:22: WARNING: Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.

   this is caused by the missing space:

```diff
        OUTPUT:

        The h*-vector as a list.

-        ..NOTE:
+        .. NOTE:

        The ``backend`` of ``self`` should be ``'normaliz'``.
```


I also suggest to remove the two backticks around the word backend in the docstrings as it is not a parameter of the functions.
