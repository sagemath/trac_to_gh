`make doc` rebuilds lots of things every time. Just run `make doc` twice to see how this is broken currently.

This is a major problem with our docker builds. Their test-dev stage times out all the time because of this.

There are several underlying problems it seems:

* the hash function that Sphinx uses has changed, our code uses the wrong hash function
* rebuilds depend on the mtime of .pyc files not on the actual .py files. (this is a problem with the docker builds.)
* often config changes are detected because the `ipython_rgxout` has changed in the configuration. This is a `_sre.SRE_Pattern`. Maybe the pickle is somehow platform dependent which makes this breaks when the docker image is pulled on a different platform?

Depends on #28041

 `make doc` rebuilds lots of things every time. Just run `make doc` twice to see how this is broken currently.
 
 This is a major problem with our docker builds. Their test-dev stage times out all the time because of this.
+
+There are several underlying problems it seems:
+
+* the hash function that Sphinx uses has changed, our code uses the wrong hash function
+* rebuilds depend on the mtime of .pyc files not on the actual .py files. (this is a problem with the docker builds.)
+* often config changes are detected because the `ipython_rgxout` has changed in the configuration. This is a `_sre.SRE_Pattern`. I have no clue what's going on here.
