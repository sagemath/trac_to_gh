```
Currently, the polar of rational polyhedra does not check, whether the polyhedron is full-dimensional:

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(3, base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.polar()
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices and 1 line
```

We fix this by adding an assertion

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(3, base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.polar()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: must be full-dimensional
```

Also we add an extra keyword `in_affine_span` (default `False`). By this one can obtain the polar in its affine span (after translation as usual):

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(3, base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.polar(in_affine_span=True)
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices

sage: point = Polyhedron([[0]])
sage: P = polytopes.cube().change_ring(QQ)
sage: (P*point).polar(in_affine_span=True) == P.polar()*point
True
```

This option seems reasonable and simplifies the current construction of barycentric subdivision.

We change the other message `"Not a polytope."` according to conventions to `"not a polytope"`.
