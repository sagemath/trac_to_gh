The `base_ring` of `face_split` should be `self.base_ring().fraction_field()`.

```
sage: P = polytopes.octahedron()
sage: P.face_split(P.faces(2)[0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                   TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)                  
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
