Currently

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3)))
```
results in a `TypeError`, as an empty list of facets is not detected as empty polyhedron.

We fix this:

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3)))
A -1-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 0 facets
```
