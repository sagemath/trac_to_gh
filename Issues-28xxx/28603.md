In order to make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron`, we replace `edge_graph` by `vertex_graph`.

In case of of unbounded polyhedra this might make a difference, as unbounded 1-faces are considered for `edge_graph` but not for `vertex_graph`.

For now we keep `edge_graph` and add a deprecation warning.

Replying to [@jplab](#comment%3A7):
> Could the sentence also include what function the use should use instead?

Sure.

The deprecation warning doesn't show in normal use. When you run the doctest manually it won't show. If you pack it in

```
sage: def foo(C):
sage:     return C.edge_graph()
```
it is printed when calling `foo`.
