In order to make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron`, we replace `edge_graph` by `vertex_graph`.

In case of of unbounded polyhedra this might make a difference, as unbounded 1-faces are considered for `edge_graph` but not for `vertex_graph`.

For now we keep `edge_graph` and add a deprecation warning.

Sure.

The deprecation warning doesn't show in normal use. When you run the doctest manually it won't show. If you pack it in

```
sage: def foo(C):
sage:     return C.edge_graph()
```
it is printed when calling `foo`.
