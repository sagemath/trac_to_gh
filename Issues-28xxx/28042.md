Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A8):
> Yes. For some reason, there are three implementations of modular arithmetic: `IntegerMod_gmp`, `IntegerMod_int` and `IntegerMod_int64` (see `rings.finite_rings.integer_mod`). When it turns to linear algebra one has to carefully use the correct type.

I gather that `IntegerMod_gmp` is not affected (as it's not handled , it's only these two "small" modn instances that got mixed up.
