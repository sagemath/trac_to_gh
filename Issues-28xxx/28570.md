This was broken by #28189.

Probably due to the new "inverse_of_unit" method taking over the existing one.

This cause the following to never stop:

```
sage: P = posets.TamariLattice(7)
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: M = H._leq_matrix
sage: M.inverse_of_unit()
```

First, the command `M.inverse_of_unit()` does actually finish for me, eventually. It takes 5 minutes or so, in contrast to `~M` which takes under 1 second.

From [reading the old code](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/categories/rings.py#n1117), it looks like `M.inverse_of_unit()` just computed the inverse and then coerced the inverse matrix to have the same base ring. In the new version, it tries to be more clever, in particular calling `M.adjugate()`. I think `M.adjugate()` is the problem for sparse integer matrices, or indeed for integer matrices in general. Even in 8.9, running `M.adjugate()` or `M.dense_matrix().adjugate()` on the matrix in the ticket description takes a long time.

One way around this would be to add an `elif` clause to the new `inverse_of_unit` which handles the case when the base ring is the integers. I don't know if this is the best choice.

One would almost think the reviewer on that ticket could have done a more thorough job :-)

More seriously, I think this shows we are running into weaknesses of our review system. I don't have concrete suggestions on how to improve it, but if this kind of thing happens more often, it might be worth considering if there are procedural changes we can make that reduce the likelihood of such bugs slipping through, without unduly narrowing the bottleneck that review already is.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A6):

This one is also not new: it's been present at least since Sage 8.6.

`_adjugate` does that :

```
A = self.charpoly().shift(-1)(self)
```
which seems to be a rather terrible idea for matrices of large size.

I ran an experiment:

```
sage: p = next_prime(2**50)
sage: R = GF(p)
sage: %timeit random_matrix(R, 50).inverse_of_unit()
```
Without this branch:

```
10 loops, best of 5: 186 ms per loop
```
With this branch:

```
10 loops, best of 5: 185 ms per loop
```
As Frédéric says, fields are handled elsewhere, so of course there is no slowdown with this branch.

Are there other concerns? It certainly fixes the integer slowdown and the `Z/p**n` bug from[comment:3](#comment%3A3).

> More seriously, I think this shows we are running into weaknesses of our review system. I don't have concrete suggestions on how to improve it, but if this kind of thing happens more often, it might be worth considering if there are procedural changes we can make that reduce the likelihood of such bugs slipping through, without unduly narrowing the bottleneck that review already is.


Here's an idea, but I don't know how feasible it is: extract every test in the `matrix` directory and make sure it works with both sparse and dense matrices. (Maybe not every test: maybe you don't want to mess with the ones in `*_dense.*`, etc.)
