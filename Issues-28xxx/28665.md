With this branch we can compute the number of permutations with given descent set for reasonably large permutations.  For example:

```
sage: n=100; D = [i-1 for i in Subsets(n).random_element()]
sage: %timeit Permutations(descents=(D, n+1)).cardinality()
1000 loops, best of 3: 649 µs per loop
sage: Permutations(descents=(D, n+1)).cardinality()
