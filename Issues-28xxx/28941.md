<a id='comment:4'></a>here is a much easier example

```
from sage.cpython.dict_del_by_value import test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value
L=list(range(10))
A={L[0]:L[1]}

print(A, B) 
```
prints `{} {0: 1}` on ARM (Raspberry Pi, armv7l) and `{} {}` on `x86_64`.

This seems to be recent - I didn't check the exact history, but on Sage 8.6 it still works correctly. (Although perhaps it just never worked with Python 3 in the 1st place).

<a id='comment:6'></a>The OS in question is 32-bit, in particular is has `SIZE_VOID_P=4` (whereas x86_64 has `8`).
In cpython's `Objects/dictobject.c`, where code in `dict_del_by_value.pyx` is said to be copied from, one has (in cpython 3.8.5)

```
#if SIZEOF_VOID_P > 4
#define DK_IXSIZE(dk)                          \
    (DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xff ?                     \
        1 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffff ?            \
            2 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffffffff ?    \
                4 : sizeof(int64_t))
#else
#define DK_IXSIZE(dk)                          \
    (DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xff ?                     \
        1 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffff ?            \
            2 : sizeof(int32_t))
#endif
```
whereas the corresponding code in `dict_del_by_value.pyx` is

```
cdef inline int DK_IXSIZE(MyPyDictKeysObject *keys):
    cdef Py_ssize_t s = keys.dk_size
    if s <= 0xff:
        return 1
    elif s <= 0xffff:
        return 2
    elif s <= 0xffffffff:
        return 4
    else:
        return 8
```

This looks like a bug to me (not sure ATM it's the same bug we deal in here, or not).

Correction, it appears Jeroen did update this code a while back to be compatible with the new dict implementation (I was just reading the code and thinking "huh...this looks like it was designed to work with the new implementation already").  But probably didn't carry over this particular detail.

The `set_dk_index` function also lacks some `SIZEOF_VOID_P` checks that are present in the upstream code.

I don't know why.

The potential issue in comment:6 does not occur here, as the dictionary is very small (I still don't get why on 32-bit x86 this works, what kind of arch difference is at play here).

It appears to be `char` (aka `int8`) is a problem - it is signed on x86, and unsigned on ARM.
This leads to a weird distortion on how the dict keys (`dk_indices`) are interpreted.

*  x86:  `dk_indices` of `{0:1}` are shown as `'as_1': b''` (i.e., all 8 0s) and for `{}` one has `b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'`
* ARM:  `dk_indices` of `{0:1}` are shown as 'as_1': b'\xff\xff\xff\xff' (i.e. 4 -1s, and 4 0s), and `{}` is recognised as a "shared key dict"


That's a truly unpleasant design of `dict()` in CPython, where these `int8`, `int16` etc are meant to be unsigned, but negative values used to indicate that it's e.g. empty.leading to complications of this sort.

moreover, in cpython these indices are held in an array of `char`, unions are not used. Probably copying C code from cpython 
rather than rewriting it in Cython might be more practical.

IMHO this method is in fact only needed for `src/sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx` - which is an alternative implementation of Python's dicts in `weakref`.
I presume it won't work on the latter, anyway, and it's not needed for "normal" dicts.

It would as long as it's not a split dict, and one could make this work on a split dict too. Probably, a generic implementation should. Presently we force our `WeakDict` to be shared.
