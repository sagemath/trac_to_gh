print(A, B) 
```
prints `{} {0: 1}` on ARM (Raspberry Pi, armv7l) and `{} {}` on `x86_64`.

This seems to be recent - I didn't check the exact history, but on Sage 8.6 it still works correctly. (Although perhaps it just never worked with Python 3 in the 1st place).

The OS in question is 32-bit, in particular is has `SIZE_VOID_P=4` (whereas x86_64 has `8`).
In cpython's `Objects/dictobject.c`, where code in `dict_del_by_value.pyx` is said to be copied from, one has (in cpython 3.8.5)

```
#if SIZEOF_VOID_P > 4
#define DK_IXSIZE(dk)                          \
    (DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xff ?                     \
        1 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffff ?            \
            2 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffffffff ?    \
                4 : sizeof(int64_t))
#else
#define DK_IXSIZE(dk)                          \
    (DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xff ?                     \
        1 : DK_SIZE(dk) <= 0xffff ?            \
            2 : sizeof(int32_t))
#endif
```
whereas the corresponding code in `dict_del_by_value.pyx` is

```
cdef inline int DK_IXSIZE(MyPyDictKeysObject *keys):
    cdef Py_ssize_t s = keys.dk_size
    if s <= 0xff:
        return 1
    elif s <= 0xffff:
        return 2
    elif s <= 0xffffffff:
        return 4
    else:
        return 8
```

This looks like a bug to me (not sure ATM it's the same bug we deal in here, or not).

That looks like a good guess to me.  This code was reworked pretty recently (I think as of Python 3.6) when adding the new dict implementation (https://bugs.python.org/issue27350) which is likely more recent than this code was last touched.  It's bad enough that we're mucking with dict internals, but as long as we are this needs to be updated.

Correction, it appears Jeroen did update this code a while back to be compatible with the new dict implementation (I was just reading the code and thinking "huh...this looks like it was designed to work with the new implementation already").  But probably didn't carry over this particular detail.

The `set_dk_index` function also lacks some `SIZEOF_VOID_P` checks that are present in the upstream code.

It appears to be `char` (aka `int8`) is a problem - it is signed on x86, and unsigned on ARM.
This leads to a weird distortion on how the dict keys (`dk_indices`) are interpreted.

*  x86:  `dk_indices` of `{0:1}` are shown as `'as_1': b''` (i.e., all 8 0s) and for `{}` one has `b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'`
* ARM:  `dk_indices` of `{0:1}` are shown as 'as_1': b'\xff\xff\xff\xff' (i.e. 4 -1s, and 4 0s), and `{}` is recognised as a "shared key dict"


That's a truly unpleasant design of `dict()` in CPython, where these `int8`, `int16` etc are meant to be unsigned, but negative values used to indicate that it's e.g. empty.leading to complications of this sort.

moreover, in cpython these indices are held in an array of `char`, unions are not used. Probably copying C code from cpython 
rather than rewriting it in Cython might be more practical.

IMHO this method is in fact only needed for `src/sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx` - which is an alternative implementation of Python's dicts in `weakref`.

It would as long as it's not a split dict, and one could make this work on a split dict too. Probably, a generic implementation should. Presently we force our `WeakDict` to be shared.

The py3 weakdict is actually susceptible to it, and it's well-illustrated in sage's weakdict's doctests. In CPython's internals, there's a macro construct called the "Trashcan" that avoids the stackoverflow by flattening the stack if it gets too deep. I didn't know how to utilize that macro in cython (it's a tricky one that breaks through control flow, so I don't know if it's even possible to wrap it so that it can be used in cython) so I ended up placing the value in a temporary tuple/list and deleting THAT, because that's already participating in the trashcan.

Additionally, for `WeakValueDict` there is a mechanism where deletions can be stored if the dict is currently locked for iteration. This was a problem in Py2 and could actually lead to deletions: Iterate over a WeakDict and have items inadvertently disappear from it due to GCs. That only affects how this routine is used there; it doesn't factor into the design of this routine particularly. Py3 dicts also have better iteration protection now, so it may be that this mechanism can be redesigned now.

Clarification for terminology from:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0412/

There are split-table dictionaries and combined-table dictionaries. In split-table dictionaries, there is room for sharing the key table for several dictionaries. Hence, split-table dictionaries can be shared-key dictionaries. So "split=shared". I might not have been consistent with this terminology. For this ticket, only "combined-table" dicts are relevant.
