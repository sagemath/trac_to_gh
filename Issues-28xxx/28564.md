This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519 and consists of:

- copies apply no name from the original in any case
- `copy` method with individual naming
- (right) multiplication with a scalar field `f` yields to the name `f*a` and the LaTeX name `f \cdot a` for any tensor/section (or scalar) field `a`

CC:  @tscrim @egourgoulhon

Keywords: **manifolds, tensor fields, scalar fields**
