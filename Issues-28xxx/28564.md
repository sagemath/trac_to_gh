It's because your develop branch is still 9.0.beta2 (this is what I see from the commit e4470b5). You should update to 9.0.beta3.

Mhm. I partially agree with you. In practice, the notation is certainly inconvenient and everything is clear by choosing correct letters, but in this case I guess everything has to be rigorous. The `\cdot` makes unambiguously clear that an operation was performed on both elements.

The doctest is fixed. This is indeed a doctest error, but strangely it didn't occur to me in the first place.

Doctest failure

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py", line 269, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField
Failed example:
    s = f*t.restrict(U); s
Expected:
    Tensor field of type (0,2) on the Open subset U of the 2-dimensional
     differentiable manifold S^2
Got:
    Tensor field f*t of type (0,2) on the Open subset U of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold S^2
```
One such doctest was fixed in the same file at line 263 but this one was missed.
