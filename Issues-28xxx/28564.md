This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519 and consists of:

- copies apply no name from the original in any case
- `copy` method with individual naming
- (right) multiplication with a scalar field `f` yields to the name `f*a` and the LaTeX name `f \cdot a` for any tensor/section (or scalar) field `a`

Thanks for your answer.

Yes there is the method `set_name()`. One could also pass the (possible) new name as an argument to `copy()`. There are a few examples (2 actually) of `copy()` taking some arguments in Sage library.

On the other hand, the dot-free notation is used in [Wikipedia article 'Vector space'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space).

Travis, do you have an opinion on that? In particular, do we have other modules in Sage with named elements? If so, what is the adopted convention? (I think we should be consistent there).
