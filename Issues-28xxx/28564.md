Yes there is the method `set_name()`. One could also pass the (possible) new name as an argument to `copy()`. There are a few examples (2 actually) of `copy()` taking some arguments in Sage library.

On the other hand, the dot-free notation is used in [Wikipedia article 'Vector space'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space).

Travis, do you have an opinion on that? In particular, do we have other modules in Sage with named elements? If so, what is the adopted convention? (I think we should be consistent there).

I don't know of any other place in Sage where we do something like this. Although at `\cdot` is much better than a period for an action IMO `^^;;`.
