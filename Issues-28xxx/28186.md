Is this change on purpose?

```diff
-        len_v=None
+        len_v = True
```

Also, the Python style guide prefers equal spacing around colons in `new_list[index: index + 1]`.

Ok, I see.

> Well, pep8 (now named pycodestyle) was telling me to change the spacing around `:`


This appears to be a bug, see https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373.

Everything else looks good to me. You can set to positive if the colons are changed back.
