I am not sure how to debug this at the Sage level.   The test asks for all isogenies of the curve E of degree up to 3, and the error is raised when computing 2-isogenies, of which there are three.  These are computed by constructing a  EllipticCurveIsogeny object using EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, ker) where ker is  a degree 1 polynomial of the form x-x0 over the base field.  Since ker is a polynomial it should the 'kohel' algorithm, but the test in line 982 of ell_curve_isogeny tests whether ker is a point using "kernel in E", which attempts to construct a point via E(ker), and that is causing the error.  There should be a better way to determine whether the caller has provided a point of E generating the kernel, and not a polynomial.

The file ell_curve_isogeny is over 4000 lines long, mostly not written by me but I have spent many hours in it debugging (though not recently).  I would have written it *very* differently.

I can try replacing the test "kernel in E" with something like

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_point import EllipticCurvePoint_field                                               
sage: isinstance(P, EllipticCurvePoint_field) and P.curve() is E
```
but how to test whether the sporadic error has gone away?
