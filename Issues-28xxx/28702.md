The current implementation of WebGL has known issues with transparent surfaces, one being noticeable rendering artifacts for closed transparent surfaces. This ticket adds the option of rendering the front side of the surface only, thereby reducing rendering artifacts. Compare these two graphics:

```
polytopes.dodecahedron().plot(opacity=.5)
polytopes.dodecahedron().plot(opacity=.5,single_side=True)
```

This option is only meant to be used with closed surfaces, because an open surface will disappear from view from certain angles if both sides are not rendered.

LGTM. I've tested it on top of #28699 on [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/threejs_tests.ipynb). 
Thanks for this improvement!
