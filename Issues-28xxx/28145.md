<a id='comment:23'></a>Some quick notes:

`SemistandardSetValuedTableaux` is *not* a factory class, it is an abstract base class (ABC) that also handles dispatching to the appropriate parent class. However, this should not be stated in the documentation as this is an implementation detail.

I think we should split the `SemistandardSetValuedTableau(x)` classes into a separate file. The `tableau.py` is already quite big and this is just dependent on those classes.

The `SetValuedTableaux` class should be named consistently with `Semistandard` added (explicit is better than implicit; plus we can be more loose with naming rules in papers as they are more localized). Also, I think it would be better served just being in the corresponding tableau file.

It probably is better to have the crystal just be a parent in the SVT hierarchy corresponding to a fixed shape (with possibly a max entry defined). That way you do not effectively have two such parents, but you probably need a warning saying the output of weight is slightly different than the others (although it typically behaves the same).

`SemistandardSetValuedTableau(x)` classes are now in one file (see semistandard_set_valued_tableau.py) and the crystal element inherits from `SemistandardSetValuedTableau`. Probably this is not the best way, because as you said, output of weight() may be different from those of crystal elements (in case one wishes to work in the weight lattice). I welcome suggestion or improvement on how to access both weight outputs from tableau and crystal element.

Most of the required code should be up; working on documentation, tests and cleanup soon. Do tell if other features need to be in this implementation.

For the crystal elements, I think it will be faster to compute the weight by definition -- e.g., (#1s, #2s, ...) -- rather than using the generic crystals code. This also allows you to document the difference. As I mentioned, the elements of the ambient space behave in the same way as the list for item lookup, but unfortunately not for iteration.

Actually, another way out of this is just to make all of the tableaux classes a crystal. We do have `['A', NN]` for type A<sub>+oo</sub>. It will be different than for the usual tableaux, but I think that inconsistency is less surprising and easier to document.

For the class names, you can remove the `size_inf` part as the naming convention for tableaux (among others) is just adding onto the name the things which are finite/specified. Although perhaps that is a problem for the `module_generators`...maybe that could be a `Family` instead of a tuple?

This is bad:

```
        SemistandardSetValuedTableaux.__init__(self,max_entry=max_entry,category=ClassicalCrystals())
        self._shape = p
        self._cartan_type = CartanType(['A', max_entry-1])
        self.Element = CrystalElementSemistandardSetValuedTableau
```
The correct element is not created because all of the `Parent.__init__` stuff is done with the wrong `Element`, so `self.element_class` is not a subclass of `self.Element`. Just set `Element` as a normal class-level attribute.

It would be good to have both `crowding` and `uncrowding` maps accessible. I would make them *also* methods of `SemistandardTableau` and `SemistandardSetValuedTableau`, respectively.

<a id='comment:30'></a>Good news: Based on Travis's suggestion (thanks Travis!) for iterating over countably many iterators (each generating countably many tableaux), the iterators for all semistandard set-valued tableaux works now.

Not so good news: The following tests are failing, and I still need to figure them out.

<a id='comment:31'></a>The problem is that the Stembridge local axioms test assumes that the index set is finite. This will be the first implementation of a type A<sub>oo</sub> crystal, so we are running into these little issues. So one option is to just disable the test, but I think we can easily fix it by making this change:

```diff
-            if index_set is None: index_set=self.index_set()
+            if index_set is None:
+                index_set=self.index_set()
+                if index_set in Sets().Infinite():

+                    index_set = [it.next() for _ in range(10)]
```
that way we get the first 10 elements. The other option would be to get 10 random elements.
A final option would be to use `from sage.misc.misc import some_tuples` and throw out all of the pairs where `i == j`, that is

```diff
-            for (i,j) in Subsets(index_set, 2):

+            for i,j in some_tuples(index_set, 2, tester._max_runs):
+                if i == j:
+                    continue
+                # Now do the rest of the test
