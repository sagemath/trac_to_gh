The documentation for one of the Stein-Watkins database functions appears to have a typo.  Specifically, the current documentation here:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/stein_watkins.html

says

> The command `SteinWatkinsPrimeData(n)` returns an iterator
> over the curves in the nth Stein-Watkins prime table, which
> contains prime conductor elliptic curves of conductor between
> n 10<sup>6</sup> and (n+1) 10<sup>6</sup>.

Unless the function or the database has changed recently,
I believe the 10<sup>6</sup> should be 10<sup>8</sup>.  At least on my home
installation of Sage 8.7, when I run `SteinWatkinsPrimeData(0)`,
I get conductors up to 10<sup>8</sup>.

In the raw data files, the documentation of files p.n says:

```
  p.n   -- curves between n*10^8 and (n+1)*10^8 with prime conductor
```
so it looks as if the suggested correction is good.

By the way, the Stein-Watkins database does not contain *all* curves in the range, just the ones they found using a search which was not intended to give complete lists.  Since then, Bennett, Gherga and Rechnitzer (see https://www.adelagherga.ca/research/BeGhRe3.pdf) have  a list of all curves of prime conductor up to 10<sup>10</sup>.
