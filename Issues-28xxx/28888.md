"Return the frobenius of ``self`` as an element of a quadratic order" is missing a dot at the end.

Not sure for this, but `if not pP[0]==P[0]` seems strange, `if pP[0] != P[0]` would be more logical. Magic number 1728 is not explained, but I suppose it is known for everyone working in the area.

Thanks a lot for the review, Jori. I fixed your suggestions.

And yes, 1728 is a well-known very-special-value for the j-invariant of elliptic curves.
