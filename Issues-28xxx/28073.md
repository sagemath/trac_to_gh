`AbstractLinearCode` is at the moment the most abstract representation of codes in Sage. This makes it very difficult to implement non-linear codes and also codes with a metric different than Hamming. 

We propose to create `AbstractCode` class that will contain metric-agnostic methods, as well as the encoder/decoder framework. `AbstractLinearCode` will derive from this class.

Depends on #27634

I created the class `AbstractCode` and moved all the relevant methods from `AbstractLinearCode`.

Originally, I had `default_encoder` and `default_decoder` parameters in the initialisation of `AbstractCode`, however, I ran into an issue with dependencies - if I set a `default_encoder` for `AbstractLinearCode`, this would then be the default for all the codes inheriting from this. I am sure that this can be fixed, however maybe it makes sense for classes such as `AbstractLinearCode` to not have default decoders/encoders?

Finally, one of the doc tests fails. I tried to set up the category stuff (`Parent.__init__()`), but I don't think I did it correctly. 

This is just a rough, first draft.

I made all the changes we discussed, namely:

The category framework is no longer set up in `AbstractCode`. Instead of inheriting from `Module`, it now inherits from `Parent`. I tried a few things, e.g. `SageObject`, `Set` here and `Parent` seemed to do the trick. I added some documentation hopefully instructing the user on how to set the category framework up.

I took `base_field` away from the initiating parameters of `AbstractCode`. This should be the only change in `AbstractLinearCode`.

The `decoder` and `encoder` methods now instruct the user to add a decoder/encoder for the code if they try to use the encoder/decoder framework without having set these up. I added tests for these. If there are no default encoders/decoders, the methods `decoders_available` and `encoders_available` return an empty list. Let me know if all the checks for `None` are correctly set up.

I extended the documentation and following the example of `AbstractLinearCode`, added an example of how to use `AbstractCode` to create a subclass.

A lot of the documentation overlaps with `AbstractLinearCode`, however I don't think this is an issue.

This looks very promising! My comments may look long but they are not too heavy. Note: this is not a complete review, I didn't compile, run the code and build the documentation. I'm hoping Dima will do that :-)

- Top of the class:
    The only assumption we kept is that the code is enumerable.
  change to
    The abstract notion of "code" that is implicitly used for this class is any
    enumerable subset of a cartesian product `A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots
    \times A_n` for some sets `A_i`. Note though that this class makes no
    attempt to directly represent the code in this fashion, allowing subclasses
    to make the appropriate choices. The notion of metric is also not
    mathematically enforced in any way, and is simply stored as a string value.
    ".

  The line just after has a line break very early, doesn't it?

- `part of the framework category` -> `part of the category framework`

- `any method that works on linear codes works for our` -> `coming from AbstractCode code`

- The example in `AbstractCode.__init__` is not great, since it doesn't yield a
  working code class (it doesn't implement `_list_` etc.). Can you make an
  small, but more meaningful example, e.g. the code consisting of the l words

  ```
  {
    00...00,
    10...00,
    11...00,
    ...
    11...10,
    11...11
  }
  ```

  For this code, you could add a full working example with implementations of
  `_list_`, `__iter__`, `__contains__`.

  The For #28209, the example could be expounded upon in a short thematic
  tutorial: adding an encoder/unencoder from the ring (ZZ mod (l+1)) into the
  code. The metric could be Hamming (though the code is of course quite bad),
  and that would allow attaching the LinearCodeNearestNeighbor decoder, which
  actually works for any code under the Hamming metric.

  That would be very nice documentation for anyone wanting to implement a new
  class of codes not fitting in linear/hamming codes.

- The example for `_repr_` and `_latex_` is unnecessarily complicated because
  `AbstractCode` does not need supplying encoders and decoders. Use instead the
  smaller example from e.g. `__contains__`.

- In doc for `decode_to_code` and `decode_to_message`, the description of
  `word` should say "an element in the ambient space as `self`". The code might
  not be vectorial in the classical sense.

- For `decoder()` and `encoder()`, the exception thrown should be a
  `NotImplementedError` and the message could perhaps be "No encoder [resp. decoder]
  implemented for this code".

- In doc for `encode`, then the description of `word` should say "an element
  of a message space of the code". The message space might not be vectorial. The
  note after the INPUT block is not appropriate anymore and should just be
  removed.

- At this abstraction there's virtually no service we could put on an Encoder or
  Decoder class which would justify having an AbstractEncoder or
  AbstractDecoder, I think. In a strongly typed OOP language, like Java, we
  would of course have to have such a thing, but I believe in Python and
  [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) in particular, the convention is not to have needless abstract
  classes. Therefore your oneline doc changes to `encoder.py` and
  `decoder.py` are spot-on: that's all the change we'll have for those files.

  However, we are left with something of a documentation problem. For where do
  we document the precise interface requirements of an encoder and a decoder
  assumed by the framework in AbstractCode? I think the best place for this is a
  (not too long) discussion at the top of the file `abstract_code.py`, i.e.
  just after "Any class inheriting ... can use the encode/decode framework".
  Here we can describe what that is, and what is meant and promised by an
  encoder/decoder.

  I am OK with having a relatively short description of the purpose, and just
  mentioning the methods an encoder must have (`encode`, `__call__` which is
  simply `encode`, `unencode`, `message_space` and `code`), and similarly for
  a decoder. And then pointing to `Encoder` and `Decoder` as examples.

Best,
Johan

You are fast! :-)

Putting it in the category framework would be great, but I think it is fine as it is. I'm happy with the example :-)

One new comment I thought of: `AbstractLinearCode` used to inherit from `Module` as well as being injected into the category framework under `Modules`. Now it inherits from `AbstractCode` which, of course, does not inherit from `Module`. My concern is whether some functionality from `Module` might now have gotten lost? 

I haven't checked out your ticket and compiled, but this is the list of methods I get with `dir(C)` on a freshly created `LinearCode` `C` on Sage 8.8.rc3:

Without inheriting from `Module`, a fresh `LinearCode` on this branch (Sage 8.9.beta4) has more methods than your list, but is missing these: `['base_extend', 'change_ring', 'endomorphism_ring']`. 

I added the Module inheritance, will push it with some bigger changes.

None of those methods seem to do anything useful, and they don't even make much sense for a (linear) code to begin with. `endomorphism_ring` is particularly unfortunate, since we have `automorphism_group_gens` which does something very useful, and a user might confuse these.

Perhaps, then, it's better to not inherit from `Module` after all?

Well, `__call__` is a natural method for any code that is encodable, so it naturally fits to `AbstractCode`. Generally in Sage for a parent `P` then `P(e)` for some value `e` does one of two things (which abstractly is maybe the same thing):

1. It "coerces" `e` into being something that can be considered to be in `P`. So you convert `e` into the shape objects in `P` have. E.g. if `F` is a field then `F(1)` gives you the 1-element of that field.

2. It uses `e` as an input to create an object in `P`. E.g. if `P` is a polynomial ring then `P[1,2,3]` creates the polynomial `1 + 2*x + 3*x^2`.

If `P` is some linear code `C`, then Item 1 is supported in the sense that if `e` is a vector in the ambient space of `C`, then `C(e)` returns `e` if `e` is in `C`, otherwise it throws an error. Not the most useful function perhaps, but it follows this coercioen convention of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath).

Item 2, however, can naturally be considered to be encoding - after all, that's the canonical way you would "construct" a codeword. Due to the convention that the default encoder should always use `F[x]^k` as the message space, then if `e` is a vector of length `k` then `C(e)` returns the encoding of `e` as a codeword.

A funny (disturbing?) detail I never considered before is that if `C` is an `[n,n]` code, then the current implementation always uses Item 1, i.e. it doesn't encode.

Anyway, this convention absolutely makes sense for any type of code I could think of. So, it should be on `AbstractCode`. For that to work, `ambient_space()` has to be on `AbstractCode` as well. But since we don't really want to force a representation of the ambient space (since it would be some clumsy cartesian product in the general case), then we should just leave it to subclasses to fill out.

In any case, it is a natural function to expect a code to have, i.e. if I was writing in a strongly typed language like Java or C#, then `AbstractCode` would be an interface, and I would require `ambient_space` to be a method that had to be implemented in subclasses.

endomorphism ring provides maps onto subcodes, which does not look as totally useless to me.

changing the ring (taking  a bigger ring) produces an additive code.

Thank you for the explanation, makes things much clearer!

I did all the changes, namely added `Module` to inheritance of `AbstractLinearCode`, merged #27634, added `ambient_space` method to `AbstractCode` with a recommendation to implement it, and moved `__call__` from `AbstractLinearCode` to `AbstractCode`.
