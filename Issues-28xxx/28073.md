`AbstractLinearCode` is at the moment the most abstract representation of codes in Sage. This makes it very difficult to implement non-linear codes and also codes with a metric different than Hamming. 

We propose to create `AbstractCode` class that will contain metric-agnostic methods, as well as the encoder/decoder framework. `AbstractLinearCode` will derive from this class.

I created the class `AbstractCode` and moved all the relevant methods from `AbstractLinearCode`.

Originally, I had `default_encoder` and `default_decoder` parameters in the initialisation of `AbstractCode`, however, I ran into an issue with dependencies - if I set a `default_encoder` for `AbstractLinearCode`, this would then be the default for all the codes inheriting from this. I am sure that this can be fixed, however maybe it makes sense for classes such as `AbstractLinearCode` to not have default decoders/encoders?

Finally, one of the doc tests fails. I tried to set up the category stuff (`Parent.__init__()`), but I don't think I did it correctly. 

This is just a rough, first draft.

Thanks for working on this! I took a quick view over the new class, and it looks good. There are some copy/paste errors in the documentation where it refers to `AbstractLinearCode` or "this linear code" etc., but that's small stuff.

More importantly, I am worried about how `AbstractCode` should fit into the category framework. In particular, a non-linear code is not necessarily a module.

The task of `AbstractCode` would then basically only consist of setting up the encoder/decoder framework, as well as providing the `metric` method, which I like (I guess `list()` is fine too). It shouldn't even have a length I guess?

In this case, I don't know whether `AbstractCode` should somehow otherwise be made a parent in the category framework, or whether we should agree that this is a "contract" that sub-classes have to do themselves.

Best,
Johan

This looks very promising! My comments may look long but they are not too heavy. Note: this is not a complete review, I didn't compile, run the code and build the documentation. I'm hoping Dima will do that :-)

- Top of the class:
    The only assumption we kept is that the code is enumerable.
  change to
    The abstract notion of "code" that is implicitly used for this class is any
    enumerable subset of a cartesian product `A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots
    \times A_n` for some sets `A_i`. Note though that this class makes no
    attempt to directly represent the code in this fashion, allowing subclasses
    to make the appropriate choices. The notion of metric is also not
    mathematically enforced in any way, and is simply stored as a string value.
    ".

  The line just after has a line break very early, doesn't it?

- `part of the framework category` -> `part of the category framework`

- `any method that works on linear codes works for our` -> `coming from AbstractCode code`

- The example in `AbstractCode.__init__` is not great, since it doesn't yield a
  working code class (it doesn't implement `_list_` etc.). Can you make an
  small, but more meaningful example, e.g. the code consisting of the l words

  ```
  {
    00...00,
    10...00,
    11...00,
    ...
    11...10,
    11...11
  }
  ```

  For this code, you could add a full working example with implementations of
  `_list_`, `__iter__`, `__contains__`.

  The For #28209, the example could be expounded upon in a short thematic
  tutorial: adding an encoder/unencoder from the ring (ZZ mod (l+1)) into the
  code. The metric could be Hamming (though the code is of course quite bad),
  and that would allow attaching the LinearCodeNearestNeighbor decoder, which
  actually works for any code under the Hamming metric.

  That would be very nice documentation for anyone wanting to implement a new
  class of codes not fitting in linear/hamming codes.

- The example for `_repr_` and `_latex_` is unnecessarily complicated because
  `AbstractCode` does not need supplying encoders and decoders. Use instead the
  smaller example from e.g. `__contains__`.

- In doc for `decode_to_code` and `decode_to_message`, the description of
  `word` should say "an element in the ambient space as `self`". The code might
  not be vectorial in the classical sense.

- For `decoder()` and `encoder()`, the exception thrown should be a
  `NotImplementedError` and the message could perhaps be "No encoder [resp. decoder]
  implemented for this code".

- In doc for `encode`, then the description of `word` should say "an element
  of a message space of the code". The message space might not be vectorial. The
  note after the INPUT block is not appropriate anymore and should just be
  removed.

- At this abstraction there's virtually no service we could put on an Encoder or
  Decoder class which would justify having an AbstractEncoder or
  AbstractDecoder, I think. In a strongly typed OOP language, like Java, we
  would of course have to have such a thing, but I believe in Python and
  [SageMath](SageMath) in particular, the convention is not to have needless abstract
  classes. Therefore your oneline doc changes to `encoder.py` and
  `decoder.py` are spot-on: that's all the change we'll have for those files.

  However, we are left with something of a documentation problem. For where do
  we document the precise interface requirements of an encoder and a decoder
  assumed by the framework in AbstractCode? I think the best place for this is a
  (not too long) discussion at the top of the file `abstract_code.py`, i.e.
  just after "Any class inheriting ... can use the encode/decode framework".
  Here we can describe what that is, and what is meant and promised by an
  encoder/decoder.

  I am OK with having a relatively short description of the purpose, and just
  mentioning the methods an encoder must have (`encode`, `__call__` which is
  simply `encode`, `unencode`, `message_space` and `code`), and similarly for
  a decoder. And then pointing to `Encoder` and `Decoder` as examples.

Best,
Johan

You are fast! :-)

Putting it in the category framework would be great, but I think it is fine as it is. I'm happy with the example :-)

One new comment I thought of: `AbstractLinearCode` used to inherit from `Module` as well as being injected into the category framework under `Modules`. Now it inherits from `AbstractCode` which, of course, does not inherit from `Module`. My concern is whether some functionality from `Module` might now have gotten lost? 

I haven't checked out your ticket and compiled, but this is the list of methods I get with `dir(C)` on a freshly created `LinearCode` `C` on Sage 8.8.rc3:

None of those methods seem to do anything useful, and they don't even make much sense for a (linear) code to begin with. `endomorphism_ring` is particularly unfortunate, since we have `automorphism_group_gens` which does something very useful, and a user might confuse these.

Perhaps, then, it's better to not inherit from `Module` after all?

IMHO, `Module` is too general, here we have free modules, a.k.a. `ModulesWithBasis`.

Is this method required by the encoder/decoder framework?

If `P` is some linear code `C`, then Item 1 is supported in the sense that if `e` is a vector in the ambient space of `C`, then `C(e)` returns `e` if `e` is in `C`, otherwise it throws an error. Not the most useful function perhaps, but it follows this coercioen convention of [SageMath](SageMath).

> None of those methods seem to do anything useful, and they don't even make much sense for a (linear) code to begin with. `endomorphism_ring` is particularly unfortunate, 


endomorphism ring provides maps onto subcodes, which does not look as totally useless to me.

changing the ring (taking  a bigger ring) produces an additive code.

Thank you for the explanation, makes things much clearer!

This was an error coming from #27634, ticket:27634#comment:40. It was fixed on the ticket, I merged the updated branch. 

I fixed the small documentation mistake.
