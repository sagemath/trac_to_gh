To make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron` we change the following names.

- `length_Hrepr` -> `n_Hrepresentation`
- `length_Vrepr` -> `n_Vrepresentation`

In `FaceIterator`:
- `length_atom_repr` -> `n_atom_rep` (note that #28608 changes `repr` to `rep`)

In `CombinatorialFace`:
- `length_Vrepr` -> `n_ambient_Vrepresentation`
- `length_Hrepr` -> `n_ambient_Hrepresentation`
As both methods are public we keep the old methods with deprecation warnings.

As a follow up in #28615 we need to fix the alignment in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/base.pxd`. Fixing it in this ticket would lead to merge conflicts and as its trivial, we can easily do it later.
