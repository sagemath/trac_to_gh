Keywords: polytopes, polar

Currently, polytopes over the integers have there own method for `polar`, which does not respect the given backend:

```
sage: polytopes.cube(backend='normaliz').polar().backend()
'ppl'
```

We add the backend to the constructor to fix this. Any backend that can handle `ZZ` can also handle `QQ`.
