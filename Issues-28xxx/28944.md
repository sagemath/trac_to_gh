Frequently (maybe half the time, maybe more), the following command crashes Sage:

```
sage: random_matrix(GF(2), 6, 133).smith_form()
python3(70264,0x10f32edc0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fcc61462f50: probably modified after being freed.
Corrupt value: 0x0
python3(70264,0x10f32edc0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGILL: An illegal instruction occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/src/bin/sage-python: line 2: 70264 Illegal instruction: 4  sage -python "$@"
```
This is with Sage 9.0, either a Python 3 or a Python 2 build, OS X 10.15.2. I don't see the same problem on an Ubuntu virtual machine.

For me, it seems to be consistent. `smith_form` is happy to deal with a 128 x 128 matrix (or even a 300 x 128 matrix, which is the largest I tried), but it cannot handle more than 128 columns: it crashes on a 2 x 129 matrix.

For comparison, I replaced GF(2) with GF(4) and GF(7).  GF(7) gave no errors (up to 150 x 150), but GF(4) gave `NotImplementedError` at various sizes of square matrices (96 x 96, 68 x 68, 93 x 93).  The error messages all look pretty much the same.  Here is one of them:

I looked into the `NotImplementedError` that I am getting with `GF(4)`. Something very strange is happening, and I am leaving this on the same ticket for now, because it may be a different symptom of whatever is causing the crashes over `GF(2)`. The following code should always print `True`.

```
M = random_matrix(GF(4), 100, 100)
for k in range(50):
    S,U,V = M.smith_form()
    print(S == U * M * V) # True
```
Instead, in any given run, I always get `False` at least a few times. And the loop usually does not get through the entire set of 50, because it is terminated by `NotImplementedError` (or, occasionally, a sage crash like the one for `GF(2)`). We are using the same matrix for the entire run, so the output should not be random.

I understand the superficial cause of the `NotImplementedError`, but not the underlying cause. The value of `t[0,0]` is always nonzero at the start of the following code snippet from the definition of `smith_form`.

```
        # now recurse: t now has a nonzero entry at 0,0 and zero entries in the rest
        # of the 0th row and column, so we apply smith_form to the smaller submatrix
        mm = t.submatrix(1,1)
        if transformation:
            dd, uu, vv = mm.smith_form(transformation=True)
        else:
            dd = mm.smith_form(transformation=False)
        mone = self.new_matrix(1, 1, [1])
        d = dd.new_matrix(1,1,[t[0,0]]).block_sum(dd)
```
However, executing `mm.smith_form` sometimes changes the value of `t[0,0]`, so that `t[0,0]` is 0 in the definition of `d`. (In the cases where the value of `t[0,0]` is changed, it seems to always be changed to 0.) This 0 in the top left corner of `d` causes a `NotImplementedError`.

The `NotImplementedError` is arising in the function `_smith_diag`, which is too complicated in the case of field coefficients. The documentation says: "If any of the d's is a unit, it replaces it with 1". We don't need to compute ideals generated by elements to test that, or compute inverses of elements mod ideals, or anything like that. This patch may avoid the `NotImplementedError` problem, but it doesn't fix the bad math (returning `False` for `S == M * U * V`, plus the occasional crash):

In case this is useful information...

I tried a some runs where (I think) I replaced all of the matrix multiplications in `smith_form`, `_smith_onestep`, and `_generic_clear_column` with high-school-level row-by-column multiplication. That didn't seem to make much difference, but one of the runs gave an error message that may be more interesting, because it seems to show that the crash was in `new_matrix`. 

```

(The line numbers in matrix2.pyx are 9 more than usual, because I inserted the definition of a function to do matrix multiplication.)

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_11_release_notes
has some interesting remarks:

```
Clang now provides a mechanism for controlling exit-time destructor registration.
 You can disable these globally with the flag -fno-c++-static-destructors, or apply the attribute [[clang::no_destroy]] to disable the destructors of specific variables. 
The attribute [[clang::always_destroy]] was also added to enable destructors of specific variables when -fno-c++-static-destructors is used. (21734598)
```
and perhaps even more relevant:

```
the static linker (ld) now moves globals that are marked as constant into a new segment:
__DATA_CONST. 
These globals may consist of compiler generated pointers that the dynamic linker (dyld) needs to fix up during load, but are otherwise constant such as vtables and explicitly declared constant pointers. 
Once dyld has finished loading the image it makes __DATA_CONST readonly. 
This change doesn’t impact well behaved code, 
but may break code that depends on undefined behavior such as using a type pun to write to a pointer that’s declared as const. (50898833)
```

A shorter crasher:

```

results in an invalid free message both on Linux (with MALLOC_CHECK_=3) and OSX
