```
Currently, conversion of quotient rings to M2 is not supported; we add this functionality:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2 - y])
sage: macaulay2(R.quotient_ring(I))
```

This also improves the conversion of ideals by moving the `MPolynomialIdeal_macaulay2_repr._macaulay2_` to `Ideal_generic._macaulay2_init_`; for example, the following now work but didn't before (see the doctests for examples):
- ideals in univariate polynomial rings

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: macaulay2(R.ideal(x^2))
```
- ideals in PIDs

```
sage: macaulay2(ideal(5))
```


Note that quotient rings in M2 inherit variable names from the ambient ring, so we mimic this behaviour in Sage::

```
sage: R = macaulay2("ZZ/7[x,y]")
sage: I = macaulay2("ideal (x^3 - y^2)")
sage: (R/I).gens()
{x, y}
sage: (R/I).sage().gens()
(x, y)
```

We also implement conversion of polynomials from quotient rings from/to M2:

```
sage: x, y = (R/I).gens()
sage: f = (x^3 + 2*y^2*x)^7; f
    18    14
2x*y   + y
sage: f.sage()
2*x*y^18 + y^14
sage: _.parent()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 7 by the ideal (x^3 - y^2)
sage: macaulay2(f.sage())
    18    14
2x*y   + y
```

<a id='comment:10'></a>The following does not work yet (not even with #28574):

```
sage: R = QQ['x,y'].quotient('x^2-y')['z,t']
sage: f = R.base_ring()('x')^2 - R('z^2')
sage: macaulay2(f)  # fails
```
This fails because the variable names in the quotient ring are named `xbar,ybar` in Sage, but `x,y` in Macaulay2. The conversion routine for polynomials does not currently take this into account when the base ring is a quotient ring.

Other than that, everything looks good to me up until here.
