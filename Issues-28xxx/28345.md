The following code fails:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K = NumberField(x^3 - 3, 'a')
sage: v = tuple(K.primes_above(3))[0]
sage: K.abs_val(v, K.zero())
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for ^:
'The Infinity Ring' and 'The Infinity Ring'
```

It should return 0. We fix the bug and add a doctest.

I set this to needs review as it seems it is done, so the patchbots can check it.

The other way to do this would be to ensure that `p^(-Infinity)` returns 0 in some way, but I don't suppose that really matters.
