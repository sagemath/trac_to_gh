We add two methods to posets.py:

- "spectrum" - This method has input a poset `P` and an element `a` of `P`.  It outputs the `a`-spectrum of `P`, which is a list of integers whose i-th entry contains the number of linear extensions of `P` with `a` in the i-th position.  In particular, the sum of the entries of the `a`-spectrum is the number of linear extensions of `P`.

- "atkinson" - This method has input a poset `P`, whose underlying undirected graph is a forest, and an element `a` of `P`.  It uses Atkinson's algorithm (see reference below) to compute the `a`-spectrum of `P` (see definition of `a`-spectrum above).

Convention for the list of methods is to refer to it as "the poset", not "a poset", or "this poset".

`atkinson` method doc-string is missing the grave character for the last use of i-th.

Not going to make those changes right away until I'm finished getting reacquainted with this code and checking things over again.

Replying to [kdilks](#comment%3A29):
> Convention for the list of methods is to refer to it as "the poset", not "a poset", or "this poset".


There is no such convention, or at least once that is followed. `unwrap` uses "this poset" and the "a poset" makes grammatical sense here. However, I am +1 for having more uniformity.

> Not going to make those changes right away until I'm finished getting reacquainted with this code and checking things over again.


Stefan (gh-sgrosser) should be soon moving stuff to the Hasse diagram backend, so give him a few days to do this.

How have you been doing Kevin?
