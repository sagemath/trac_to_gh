We add two methods to posets.py:

- "spectrum" - This method has input a poset `P` and an element `a` of `P`.  It outputs the `a`-spectrum of `P`, which is a list of integers whose i-th entry contains the number of linear extensions of `P` with `a` in the i-th position.  In particular, the sum of the entries of the `a`-spectrum is the number of linear extensions of `P`.

- "atkinson" - This method has input a poset `P`, whose underlying undirected graph is a forest, and an element `a` of `P`.  It uses Atkinson's algorithm (see reference below) to compute the `a`-spectrum of `P` (see definition of `a`-spectrum above).

M. D. Atkinson, *On computing the number of linear extensions of a tree*, Order **7** (1990), 23-25.

Rebased the ticket on release `9.1.beta9` and made a few revisions to docstrings and code to improve a few conventions.  The functionality for this ticket seems to be working well, so I think the patch should be good to go.

Since I didn't directly write any of the code for the original patch, I'm going to call this a positive review with a reviewer patch.  If one of the other authors can verify that the rebased code works for them as expected, we should be all set to change the ticket to positive review.

I have just made a few documentation tweaks.

I think that computing and storing all of that information would take more time since it is done in Python than the binomial computation time (done at at most the C level if not a lower level). So I don't think it is worthwhile to do this right now unless we already have efficient code to generate Pascal's triangle.

However, if you do want a way to get more speed with minimal changes, I would suggest moving all of the helper functions to the Hasse diagram. That way you are working with integer labels and directly on the underlying digraph.

Convention for the list of methods is to refer to it as "the poset", not "a poset", or "this poset".

`atkinson` method doc-string is missing the grave character for the last use of i-th.

There is no such convention, or at least once that is followed. `unwrap` uses "this poset" and the "a poset" makes grammatical sense here. However, I am +1 for having more uniformity.

> Not going to make those changes right away until I'm finished getting reacquainted with this code and checking things over again.

Stefan (gh-sgrosser) should be soon moving stuff to the Hasse diagram backend, so give him a few days to do this.
