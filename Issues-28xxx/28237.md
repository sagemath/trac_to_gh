# Issue 28237: Implement Atkinson's algorithm for counting linear extensions of (tree) posets

We add two methods to posets.py:

- "spectrum" - This method has input a poset `P` and an element `a` of `P`.  It outputs the `a`-spectrum of `P`, which is a list of integers whose i-th entry contains the number of linear extensions of `P` with `a` in the i-th position.  In particular, the sum of the entries of the `a`-spectrum is the number of linear extensions of `P`.

- "atkinson" - This method has input a poset `P`, whose underlying undirected graph is a forest, and an element `a` of `P`.  It uses Atkinson's algorithm (see reference below) to compute the `a`-spectrum of `P` (see definition of `a`-spectrum above).

There is no such convention, or at least once that is followed. `unwrap` uses "this poset" and the "a poset" makes grammatical sense here. However, I am +1 for having more uniformity.

> Not going to make those changes right away until I'm finished getting reacquainted with this code and checking things over again.


Stefan (gh-sgrosser) should be soon moving stuff to the Hasse diagram backend, so give him a few days to do this.
