An *embedded (resp. immersed) degenerate submanifold of a proper 
pseudo-Riemannian manifold* `(M,g)` is an embedded (resp. immersed) 
submanifold `H` of `M` as a differentiable manifold such that pull 
back of the metric tensor `g` via the embedding (resp. immersion) 
endows `H` with the structure of a degenerate manifold.

Degenerate submanifolds are study in many fields of mathematics and physics,
for instance in Differential Geometry (especially in geometry of
lightlike submanifold) and in General Relativity. In geometry of lightlike 
submanifolds, according to the dimension `r` of the radical distribution
(see below for definition of radical distribution), degenerate submanifolds 
have been classify into 4 subgroups: `r-`lightlike submanifolds, Coisotropic 
submanifolds, Isotropic submanifolds and Totally lightlike submanifolds.
(See the book of Krishan L. Duggal and Aurel Bejancu in *REFERENCES*.) 

In the present module, you can definie any of the 4 types but most of the
methods are implemented only for degenerate hypersurfaces who belong to
`r-`lightlike submanifolds. However, their might be generalized to
`1-`lightlike submanifolds. In the litterature there is a new approach
(the rigging technique) for studying `1-`lightlike submanifolds but
here we we the method of Krishan L. Duggal and Aurel Bejancu base on
the screen distribution.

Let `H` be a lightlike hypersurface of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold
`(M,g)`. Then the normal bundle `T^\perp H` intersect the tangent 
bundle `TH`. The radical distribution is defined as
'Rad(TH)=TH\cap T^\perp H'. In case of hypersurfaces, and more
generally `1-`lightlike submanifolds, this is a rank 1 distribution. 
A screen distribution `S(TH)` is a complementary of `Rad(TH)` in `TH`.

Giving a screen distribution `S(TH)` and a null vector field `\xi` 
locally defined and spanning `Rad(TH)`, there exists a unique 
transversal null vector field 'N' locally defined and such that 
`g(N,\xi)=1`. From a transverse vector 'v', the null rigging 'N'
is giving by the formula

.. MATH::

    N = \frac{1}{g(\xi, v)}\left(v-\frac{g(v,v)}{2g(xi, v)}\xi\right)

Tensors on the ambient manifold 'M' are projected on 'H' along 'N'
to obtain induced objects. For instance, induced connection is the
linear connexion defined on H through the Levi-Civitta connection of
'g' along `N`.

To work on a degenerate submanifold, after defining `H` as an instance
of :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold`,
with the keyword *structure='degenerate'*, you have to set a transvervector
`v` and screen distribution together with the radical distribution.

An example of degenerate submanifold from General Relativity is the
horizon of the Shawrzschild black hole. Allow us to recall that 
Shawrzschild black hole is the first non-trivial solution of Einstein's
equations. It describes the metric inside a star of radius `R = 2m`,
being `m` the inertial mass of the star. It can be seen as an open
ball in a Lorentzian manifold structure on `\RR^4`::
