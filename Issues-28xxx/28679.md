Two functions, shape() and shape_partition(), with identical descriptions and examples. But there seems to be no funtion shape_partition().

The function to_partition() has again the same examples as shape() and 
shape_partition() but does not show the use of to_partition().

I think that this is intentional: see lines 875--877 of `set_partition.py`:

```
    # we define aliases for shape()
    shape_partition = shape

I respect the reviewer's decision. But for the future, we may consider adopting a documentation convention like

```
    #: alias of :meth:`shape`
    shape_partition = shape

    #: alias of :meth:`shape`
    to_partition = shape    
```
for aliases, to prevent confusion.
