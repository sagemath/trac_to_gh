These files describes the conda environment (conda package dependencies):

`environment.yml` - describes conda packages that are useful for installing sage.

This would be a more idiomatic alternative to the `conda install` line that is shown at the end of `./configure`

In combination with the `spkg-configure` mechanism, this will speed up installation of Sage, in particular for users stuck on outdated OS distributions.

Open:
- use [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI to actually check that sage builds with `environment.yml`
- scripts to support keeping package versions in sync between `environment.yml`, sage-the-distribution (`build/pkgs`), and conda-forge packaging (https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/tree/master/recipe, https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/tree/master/recipe)

First of all, I think it's great to explore ways to provide an *alternative* to the SPKG system. I have been wanting to use conda for this for a long time.

I have not used conda-debug a lot but I think a combination of `conda debug [sagelib-recipe]`, `conda install sage`, `conda remove sagelib --force` should essentially do the right thing here as well.

A proper `environment.yml` file, as you propose, probably makes more sense though. For me the question is how we can make sure that it is kept up to date. We might want to use [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI to actually check that sagelib builds with that environment.yml.

No, the default is already to use the "system" package when it is available and deemed suitable by the configure test.
It can be changed to using the sage distribution's package by using `configure --with-system-glpk=no`.

This works reasonably well already (this is on macOS Mojave, with current miniconda 3). 
I had the problem that `automake` and `aclocal` installed by conda segfault, so I bootstrapped Sage using the homebrew binaries.
Then, running `configure`, most packages that have `spkg-configure` scripts recognize the installed conda packages, with the following exceptions:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PERL_TERM_READLINE_GNU
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI_SEADATA_SMALL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GF2X
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LIBSEMIGROUPS
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PATCH
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ISL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI*
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ECLIB
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LCALC
```
Then, a parallel `make` succesfully compiled 135 packages but got stuck on `ecl-16.1.2.p5`, `openblas-0.3.6.p0`, and `tachyon-0.98.9.p7`.

For pari, you need to install `pari-nftables` as well. Can you post the config.log so that we can debug why the other packages are not picked up?

Btw, since this ticket focuses on spkg-configure, shouldn't the packages installed be limited to the ones with an spkg-configure?

Thanks a lot, this is looking great.

As for `perl_term_readline_gnu`, as far as I understand, conda-forge packages `perl` and `perl-app-cpanminus` but not individual CPAN packages, and one is expected to install any packages using `cpanminus`.
