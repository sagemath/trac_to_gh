These files describes the conda environment (conda package dependencies):

`environment.yml` - describes conda packages that are useful for installing sage.

This would be a more idiomatic alternative to the `conda install` line that is shown at the end of `./configure`

In combination with the `spkg-configure` mechanism, this will speed up installation of Sage, in particular for users stuck on outdated OS distributions.

Open:
- use [GitLab](GitLab) CI to actually check that sage builds with `environment.yml`
- scripts to support keeping package versions in sync between `environment.yml`, sage-the-distribution (`build/pkgs`), and conda-forge packaging (https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/tree/master/recipe, https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/tree/master/recipe)

(Actually, the sagelib one is more complicated - see #28752!)

This works reasonably well already (this is on macOS Mojave, with current miniconda 3). 
I had the problem that `automake` and `aclocal` installed by conda segfault, so I bootstrapped Sage using the homebrew binaries.
Then, running `configure`, most packages that have `spkg-configure` scripts recognize the installed conda packages, with the following exceptions:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PERL_TERM_READLINE_GNU
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI_SEADATA_SMALL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GF2X
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LIBSEMIGROUPS
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PATCH
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ISL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI*
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ECLIB
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LCALC
```
Then, a parallel `make` succesfully compiled 135 packages but got stuck on `ecl-16.1.2.p5`, `openblas-0.3.6.p0`, and `tachyon-0.98.9.p7`.

Btw, since this ticket focuses on spkg-configure, shouldn't the packages installed be limited to the ones with an spkg-configure?
