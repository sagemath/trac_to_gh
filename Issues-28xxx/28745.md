These files describes the conda environment (conda package dependencies):

`environment.yml` - describes conda packages that are useful for installing sage.

This would be a more idiomatic alternative to the `conda install` line that is shown at the end of `./configure`

In combination with the `spkg-configure` mechanism, this will speed up installation of Sage, in particular for users stuck on outdated OS distributions.

Open:
- use [GitLab](GitLab) CI to actually check that sage builds with `environment.yml`
- scripts to support keeping package versions in sync between `environment.yml`, sage-the-distribution (`build/pkgs`), and conda-forge packaging (https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/tree/master/recipe, https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/tree/master/recipe)

No, the default is already to use the "system" package when it is available and deemed suitable by the configure test.
It can be changed to using the sage distribution's package by using `configure --with-system-glpk=no`.

<a id='comment:18'></a>This works reasonably well already (this is on macOS Mojave, with current miniconda 3). 
I had the problem that `automake` and `aclocal` installed by conda segfault, so I bootstrapped Sage using the homebrew binaries.
Then, running `configure`, most packages that have `spkg-configure` scripts recognize the installed conda packages, with the following exceptions:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PERL_TERM_READLINE_GNU
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI_SEADATA_SMALL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GF2X
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LIBSEMIGROUPS
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PATCH
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ISL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI*
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ECLIB
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LCALC
```
Then, a parallel `make` succesfully compiled 135 packages but got stuck on `ecl-16.1.2.p5`, `openblas-0.3.6.p0`, and `tachyon-0.98.9.p7`.
