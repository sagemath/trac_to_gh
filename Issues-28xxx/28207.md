Reported in [Ask SageMath question #47169](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47169/plotting-derivative-of-bump-function/), we can't differentiate the bump function:

```
sage: f(x) = piecewise([((-oo, -1), 0), ((-1, 1), exp(-1/(1 - x^2))), ((1, oo), 0)])
sage: f.diff()
x |--> (0, 0, 0)*D[0]piecewise(x|-->0 on (-oo, -1), x|-->e^(1/(x^2 - 1)) on (-1, 1), x|-->0 on (1, +oo); x) + D[1]piecewise(x|-->0 on (-oo, -1), x|-->e^(1/(x^2 - 1)) on (-1, 1), x|-->0 on (1, +oo); x)
sage: f.diff()(0)
(0, 0, 0)*e^(-1) + e^(-1)
sage: f.diff()(0) in RR
False
```

That's not right...

I am not sure these should actually count as bugs as the behavior is consistent with what other symbolic functions do:

```
sage: y = SR.var('y')
sage: f(x) = x*y + x + y
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: f
x |--> x*y + x + y

sage: f.derivative(x)
x |--> y + 1
sage: f.derivative(y)
x |--> x + 1
```
What would you expect the output to be?
