This ticket introduces sorting of dictionary keys and set elements (including finite `Set`s) in rich output, mimicking IPython's behaviour (actually, it uses IPython's `_sorted_for_pprint` function for sorting).

It also avoids line breaks between the key and value in the LaTeX representation of dictionaries, and introduces sorting in the plain representation of finite `Set`s.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
In the LaTeX output, the entire contents of the dictionary are now wrapped in big curly braces, as I don't know how to add them only to the first and last line (`\left\{ ... \right.` will not work, since there's a `&` in between) - besides, their sizes may not match, which could be ugly. I guess we could have a horizontal layout if the dictionary could fit in a line, but I don't know how to check it (and it may be part of a longer line anyway, thus requiring line breaks).

I will also add sorting for sets. This will require adding a new function to handle Python sets.
