Given an angle theta in RR/ZZ, the *kneading sequence* of theta is a binary string that gives information about the dynamics of theta under the doubling map. These combinatorial kneading sequences are useful for understanding dynamics near the roots of hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set.

Keywords: sd104, mandelbrot
