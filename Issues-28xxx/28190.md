Until python2 is dropped, many packages which have dropped python 2 support upstream (ipython, sphinx, scipy, networkx, matplotlib...) are stuck to old, unmaintained versions in sage. This will pose a particular problem for distros once Sage defaults to python 3, since those distros will probably be carrying newer versions of these dependencies and sage will have to be heavily patched to work with them.

The aim of this ticket is to allow different versions for python2/python3 packages, so the python3 versions can be kept up to date in sage itself and the relevant patches can be upstreamed.

It will also be simpler to remove the `python2-*` repos when the life of Python2 terminates.

Who is going to take care of that ?

* I would suggest not to change the name of the packages, not to duplicate.

* Rather have (when required) inside build/pkg folders some new files `checksums-legacy.ini` and `package-version-legacy.txt`

* Change the script in the appropriate place (where ?) so that it chooses the version to install according to the python version.

Erik, Jeroen : your opinions on the problem, please ?

Let's start by analyzing the problem and possible solutions before discussing implementation details.

For a given package, let V2 be the latest version supporting Python 2 and let V3 be the latest version supporting Python 3. There are several possibilities (assuming obviously that V3 >= V2):

(A) V2 == V3: the package continues to support Python 2.

(B) V2 < V3 but the versions are compatible: the functionality that Sage uses works the same way with both versions.

(C) V2 and V3 are incompatible.

In case (A), nothing need to be done, so we don't need to discuss this further. In case (B), it doesn't really matter what we do: even if a distro uses a different version from Sage, there is no problem. So we really need to worry only about case (C). So first of all a serious question: are there packages where (C) currently applies? If not, we're solving a non-problem.

For (C), I see three possible solutions:

(i) continue using V2 in Sage and leave it up to the distros to deal with that.

(ii) use V2 when compiling with Python 2 and V3 when compiling with Python 3.

(iii) use V3 and drop support for Python 2 in Sage completely.

This ticket proposes (ii) but I'm not convinced that this is what we should do. It means that code in the Sage library needs to deal with supporting two incompatible versions of a package. That will complicate the code and increase chances of breakage.

If we can wait, maybe (iii) is actually a viable option: Python 2 is officially unsupported half a year from now. If Sage fully works under Python 3 by then, maybe we can drop Python 2 support at that time.

What would that deprecation mean in practice?

From the user's point of view, Sage uses either Python 2 or Python 3 (whatever we default to at installation time), so there is going to be a sudden break anyway sooner or later. Once you're defaulting to Python 3, I don't know if we should still put effort in supporting Python 2.

As mentioned by Samuel on the mailing list, there is a distinct situation where we might want to upgrade packages to Python3 before the transition py2 -> py3: the jupyter notebook. It is not exactly covered by the ticket description.

More concretely, we could
- python3 install the modules: `jupyter_core`, `jupyter_client`, `traitlets`, `decorator`, `enum34`, `pyzmq`, `dateutil`
- remove python2 installation of `jupyter_core` and `jupyter_client` (and dead dependencies)
- run the jupyter notebook under python3

Question: would that really be useful?

+1 on that point. If users don't want to migrate right away, they can continue using an older sage version. That may have security implications of course, but since some dependencies won't receive any updates anyway those implications are there either way.

There is little point to the "python2 deadline" if half of the projects decide "just a little longer".

My current ipython 7 patch is almost 5000 LOC and getting harder to maintain, it would be nice to upstream it. Also, updating to python 3.8 would be more complicated if python2 support is to be kept, see ticket:27754#comment:55",

Now that 9.0 is out, what is the plan for this? Is python2 going to be dropped for 9.1? My current ipython 7 patch is almost 5000 LOC and getting harder to maintain, it would be nice to upstream it. Also, updating to python 3.8 would be more complicated if python2 support is to be kept, see ticket:27754#comment:55
