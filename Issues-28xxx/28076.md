This is a complex algorithm if you want an efficient implementation. 

Have you checked if someone has proposed a C/C++ implementation that could be interfaced with Sagemath as an optional package ? We have several external code like that, for instance `bliss` for isomorphisms, `tdlib` for treewidth and tree-decomposition (which should be updated as the original code has been improved), etc.

At least it could help you for the implementation.
