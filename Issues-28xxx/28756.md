With sage 9.0.beta6 and gurobi, we get 17 failing doctests due to str vs bytes (`TypeError: expected bytes, str found`), char vs str, and the change of behavior of zip between py2 and py3 (`TypeError: object of type 'zip' has no len()`). Some problems were fixed in #28206, but it was apparently not enough.
Try:

```
sage -t --long --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/numerical/linear_functions.pyx src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor.py src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_constraints.py  src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_element.pyx  src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx  src/sage/numerical/backends/gurobi_backend.pyx
```
which gives

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/numerical/linear_functions.pyx  # 29 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor.py  # 20 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_constraints.py  # 28 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_element.pyx  # 23 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/numerical/backends/gurobi_backend.pyx  # 17 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

We also fix some compilation warnings.
