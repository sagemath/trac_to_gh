For lattice polytopes, the Ehrhart polynomial may now be computed using either `latte_int` or `normaliz`  as the engine. As the dimension of the polytope increases, `latte_int` appears to be much faster at computing the Ehrhart polynomial.

For example, below is a table comparing computation times of the Ehrhart polynomial for a dilated simplex. It was computed using `time.time()` by subtracting a start time from an end time::

```
for i in range(2,11):
p = i * polytopes.simplex(i,backend = 'normaliz')
```
| Dimension | Normaliz | Latte |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| 2  | 0.0005509853363037109  | 0.0 | 
| 3  | 0.0008060932159423828  | 0.0 |
| 4  | 0.0011680126190185547  | 0.0 |
| 5  | 0.0013370513916015625  | 0.0 |
| 6  |    0.0030059814453125  | 0.0 |
| 7  |  0.009865999221801758  | 0.0 |
| 8  |    0.0852811336517334  | 0.0 |
| 9  |    1.4878380298614502  | 0.0 |
| 10 |   28.114959955215454   | 0.0 |
| 11 |    774.3957607746124   | 0.0 |
This could motivate making `latte_int` the default engine for Ehrhart polynomial computations of lattice polytopes and continuing to maintain `latte_int` as an engine.

We will run comparisons for polytopes with many vertices. Could you suggest a degenerate polytope that would be good to look at?

I am not sure what you are computing. I have just done the Ehrhart series for a cube of dimension 10 on my laptop in native Normaliz: 2.8 sec whereas you seem to get 45 sec in dimension 6 already.

The cubes have many vertices, but they are all simple and even unimodular.

O.K. Then the timing makes sense.

You should also compare cross polytopes. They have few, but very degenerate vertices.
