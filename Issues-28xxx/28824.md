I'm hitting pretty reliably a race in the doc-pdf target:

```
$ make doc-clean && make -j10 doc-pdf
[...]
[docpdf] [59 [40
[docpdf] Runaway definition?
[docpdf] ->\bibcite {index 
[docpdf] ! File ended within \read.
[...]
```
Re-running `make doc-pdf` eventually succeeds. Clearly a partially-written bibliography file is somewhere read by another process.

<a id='comment:4'></a>hyperref and xr-hyper definitely is not operating atomically on the file system, so the only options are to run LaTeX in serial or use separate aux files.

For cross references to work in general (and parallel) we'd also have run LaTeX twice on each tex file, first to generate all references and then to build the actual pdf with the cross-references. That is:

* For each tex file `foo.tex`: run `pdflatex foo.tex` to generate `foo.aux`
* Combine the aux files into a `crossreferences.aux` file
* For each tex file: run pdflatex again, but this time `\input{crossreferences.aux}`

If we only want to include bibitems from the bibliography section then we don't have to do the whole thing, we can just create references.aux and include it in all the other files. This seems to be what is implemented, we should just not use xr-hyper (which will also write to references.aux) and instead manually include the references.aux (read only)

I'm glad there is the expertise to fix these things. I thought the issue was somewhere under the `docbuild` folder but had no idea where. This allows building of the `pdf-docs` without issue. I'll build once more to save the `build.log` to see if anything odd is there.
