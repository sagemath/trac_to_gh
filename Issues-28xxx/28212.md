Currently, the all_periodic_points() method uses an algorithm that reduces the function modulo p and checks for possible cycle lengths and lifts. This method may be slow in certain cases, such as x<sup>2</sup> - 3/4, where we resort to calling the periodic_points() method which solves for the dynatomic polynomial.
