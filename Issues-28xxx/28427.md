We fix a bug in constructing the `0` element of a Lie algebra by putting that path higher in the `_element_constructor_`.

We make all of the Lie algebras and modules in `virasoro.py` know that they are graded.

Implement a fallback to the PBW basis for when the construction of the universal enveloping algebra fails for finite-dimensional Lie algebras with a basis.

Allow coercions and actions between Lie algebras to lift to the PBW bases.

Please fix the doc of the Virasoro degree_on_basis function: it should mention c, too.

```
+        We skip the grading test as we need to be able to echelonize a
+        matrix over the base ring as part of the test::
+
             sage: L = lie_algebras.pwitt(Zmod(6), 6)
-            sage: TestSuite(L).run()  # not tested -- universal envelope doesn't work
-            sage: L._test_jacobi_identity()
+            sage: TestSuite(L).run(skip="_test_grading"
```
What needs to be echelonized?

The runtime error check is a bit of a hack -- but it may well be fine. Are you sure Singular will always throw a runtime error if it doesn't recognize the base ring as a field, as opposed to silently responding with a wrong result?

It is done in computing the homogeneous degree component as part of the test.

> The runtime error check is a bit of a hack -- but it may well be fine. Are you sure Singular will always throw a runtime error if it doesn't recognize the base ring as a field, as opposed to silently responding with a wrong result?

The reason Singular throws the error is because it only can work over certain base rings. If it silently returns a wrong result, then there is nothing anyone can do except submit an upstream bug report.

You are way overthinking this Singular thing. Just run the test and you will see for the echelonization.

I have updated the documentation. I also was more precise about that singular is failing for the **Z**/6**Z** example (although its documentation does (implicitly) say the algebra needs to be defined over a field; at least, I am fairly certain it needs an integral domain). I also did another improvement that I think would be useful, to allow coercions and actions to lift to the PBW basis.

Here also is the traceback of what happens in the grading test:

You can see where it needs to be able to echelonize a matrix. If we wanted to fix this, we would have to change the test itself by weakening it when it is not over a field (which should be a separate ticket as that has farther reaching implications).

Also, no problem with not doing more reviewing. I know you are starting a new tenure-track job. `;)`
