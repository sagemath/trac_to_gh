Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):

* package: r-3.6.1
  log file: /home/factoreal/Downloads/SageMath/logs/pkgs/r-3.6.1.log
  build directory: /home/factoreal/Downloads/SageMath/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.6.1

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.
