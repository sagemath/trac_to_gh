The following code leads to an error:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: eX = X.frame()
sage: a = M.one_form()
sage: b = M.one_form()
sage: a[eX,:] = x*y, x+y
sage: b.set_restriction(a)
sage: b.display()

ValueError   Traceback (most recent call last)
...

ValueError: no basis could be found for computing the components in the Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy))
```

Mathematically, this should not happen.

A method `copy_from` is added, and in case of the same domain, the `copy_from` method is invoked, when `set_restriction` is used.

This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Replying to [gh-DeRhamSource](#comment%3A9):
> Is this better?


Much better! ;-)

A question though: what's the point of 

```
    TensorField.copy_from(self, other)
``` 
in `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()` ?
Actually, the action of `TensorField.copy_from` amounts to copying the restrictions, but the restrictions are deleted by the subsequent call:

```
    FreeModuleTensor.copy_from(self, other)
```
due to 

```        
    self._del_derived()
```
in `FreeModuleTensor.copy_from()`. 

In view of this, I would simply delete `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()`, so that `copy_from()` in `TensorFieldParal` is inherited from `FreeModuleTensor`.

Ah! Yes! The order should be switched then, right?

A copy of the restrictions even for `TensorFieldParal` would be convenient, wouldn't it?

Yes if you would like to maintain `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()` with the copies of the restrictions.
> A copy of the restrictions even for `TensorFieldParal` would be convenient, wouldn't it?

I am not so sure: for `TensorFieldParal`, restrictions are derived quantities, which can be easily reconstructed at any time if necessary. Not copying them makes `copy_from()` faster. If we have `a.copy_from(b)` with restrictions of `b` having been constructed for whatever reasons, it could be that in the future use of `a`, no restriction will be invoked.

Sorry I haven't seen your message before pushing the new branch; it seems we were working on solving the conflict at the same time ;-). 

The general method I am using to see the conflicting files/lines is the following one:
- start from a clean develop branch (i.e. 9.0.beta3 in the present case)
- do 
  {{{
  git checkout -b set_restriction-28628
  git pull trac u/gh-DeRhamSource/tensor_fields__set_restriction_behaviour
  }}}
This generates an error message, stating that there is a conflict in `tensorfield.py`.
Edit the latter to fix the conflict and do `git add tensorfield.py`, then `git commit`, etc.

However, you solved the merge conflict and I'd say, we take your branch, now.

It seems there is a merge conflict between 9.0.beta3 and #28564; so if you want to practice...
