When rebuilding, `configure` prints many messages of the following form:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the zlib SPKG ===
configure: === checking whether to install the libpng SPKG ===
configure: === checking whether to install the freetype SPKG ===
```
with no indication of actual tests or the result of the check.
This ticket adds some helpful output.
