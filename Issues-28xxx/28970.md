CC:  @jhpalmieri @malb

This is split off from the discussion at #28944.

I am using a Python 3 build of 9.0 on Mac OS 10.15.1. The following code should always print True.

```
M = random_matrix(GF(4), 100, 100)
for k in range(50):
    S,U,V = M.smith_form()
    print(S == U * M * V) # True
```

Instead, in any given run, I always get False at least a few times. And the loop usually does not get through the entire set of 50, because it is terminated by `NotImplementedError` (or, occasionally, a sage crash like the one reported in #28944). We are using the same matrix for the entire run, so the output should not be random.

`@`jhpalmieri reported in #28944 that he has seen this issue on OS X 10.14.6, but not on an Ubuntu virtual machine. It also did not show up in my limited testing on `CoCalc`. So (like #28944) this seems to be a Mac OS issue.

I do not see this problem when `GF(4)` is replaced with a different finite field. Fields of odd order do not seem to have any problems at all, but fields of characteristic 2 crash as reported for `GF(2)` in #28944.

I understand the superficial cause of the `NotImplementedError`, but not the underlying cause. The value of `t[0,0]` is always nonzero at the start of the following code snippet from the definition of `smith_form`.

```
        # now recurse: t now has a nonzero entry at 0,0 and zero entries in the rest
        # of the 0th row and column, so we apply smith_form to the smaller submatrix
        mm = t.submatrix(1,1)
        if transformation:
            dd, uu, vv = mm.smith_form(transformation=True)
        else:
            dd = mm.smith_form(transformation=False)
        mone = self.new_matrix(1, 1, [1])
        d = dd.new_matrix(1,1,[t[0,0]]).block_sum(dd)
```

However, executing `mm.smith_form` sometimes changes the value of `t[0,0]`, so that `t[0,0]` is 0 in the definition of `d`. (In the cases where the value of `t[0,0]` is changed, it seems to always be changed to 0.) This 0 in the top left corner of `d` causes a `NotImplementedError`. (The patch in ticket #28967 eliminates the `NotImplementedError`, by providing a definition of `inverse_mod`, but the value returned by `smith_form` will be incorrect, because the value of `t[0,0]` is wrong.) 

How can `mm.smith_form` be changing the value of `t`?

I'm using Sage's m4ri and m4rie, and both pass their test suites. There are warnings in the log files, but nothing jumps out at me. For m4rie, I saw this:

```
m4rie/strassen.c:52:7: warning: absolute value function 'abs' given an argument of type 'long' but has parameter of type 'int' which may cause truncation of value [-Wabsolute-value]
  if (CLOSER(m, m/2, cutoff) || CLOSER(k, k/2, cutoff) || CLOSER(n, n/2, cutoff)) {

                            ^
m4rie/strassen.c:52:7: note: use function 'labs' instead
```
so I patched m4rie to change `abs` to `labs`. It didn't affect the behavior.
