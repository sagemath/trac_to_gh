```
This is split off from the discussion at #28944.

I am using a Python 3 build of 9.0 on Mac OS 10.15.1. The following code should always print True.

```
M = random_matrix(GF(4), 100, 100)
for k in range(50):
    S,U,V = M.smith_form()
    print(S == U * M * V) # True
```

Instead, in any given run, I always get False at least a few times. And the loop usually does not get through the entire set of 50, because it is terminated by `NotImplementedError` (or, occasionally, a sage crash like the one reported in #28944). We are using the same matrix for the entire run, so the output should not be random.

@jhpalmieri reported in #28944 that he has seen this issue on OS X 10.14.6, but not on an Ubuntu virtual machine. It also did not show up in my limited testing on `CoCalc`. So (like #28944) this seems to be a Mac OS issue.

I do not see this problem when `GF(4)` is replaced with a different finite field. Fields of odd order do not seem to have any problems at all, but fields of characteristic 2 crash as reported for `GF(2)` in #28944.

I understand the superficial cause of the `NotImplementedError`, but not the underlying cause. The value of `t[0,0]` is always nonzero at the start of the following code snippet from the definition of `smith_form`.

```
        # now recurse: t now has a nonzero entry at 0,0 and zero entries in the rest
        # of the 0th row and column, so we apply smith_form to the smaller submatrix
        mm = t.submatrix(1,1)
        if transformation:
            dd, uu, vv = mm.smith_form(transformation=True)
        else:
            dd = mm.smith_form(transformation=False)
        mone = self.new_matrix(1, 1, [1])
        d = dd.new_matrix(1,1,[t[0,0]]).block_sum(dd)
```

However, executing `mm.smith_form` sometimes changes the value of `t[0,0]`, so that `t[0,0]` is 0 in the definition of `d`. (In the cases where the value of `t[0,0]` is changed, it seems to always be changed to 0.) This 0 in the top left corner of `d` causes a `NotImplementedError`. (The patch in ticket #28967 eliminates the `NotImplementedError`, by providing a definition of `inverse_mod`, but the value returned by `smith_form` will be incorrect, because the value of `t[0,0]` is wrong.) 

How can `mm.smith_form` be changing the value of `t`?

Assuming you use Sage's m4ri(e): Try doing internal tests of m4ri and m4rie:

```
SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -f m4ri
SAGE_CHECK=yes ./sage -f m4rie
```
and see whether you manage to get errors there.

I'm using Sage's m4ri and m4rie, and both pass their test suites. There are warnings in the log files, but nothing jumps out at me. For m4rie, I saw this:

```
m4rie/strassen.c:52:7: warning: absolute value function 'abs' given an argument of type 'long' but has parameter of type 'int' which may cause truncation of value [-Wabsolute-value]

m4rie/strassen.c:31:29: note: expanded from macro 'CLOSER'

                            ^
m4rie/strassen.c:52:7: note: use function 'labs' instead
```
so I patched m4rie to change `abs` to `labs`. It didn't affect the behavior.
