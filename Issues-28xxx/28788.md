`config.log` is still misleading:

```
result: no
no suitable system package found for SPKG rw
configure:20250: make will build and install the following SPKGs...
     4ti2-1.6.7.p0
     alabaster-0.7.12
     appnope-0.1.0.p0
     arb-2.16.0.p0 (no suitable system package)
     atlas-3.10.2.p3
     ...
     bzip2-1.0.6-20150304.p0 (using system package; will not be installed)
     ...
```
`4ti2` and `atlas` are optional, and so they will not in fact be installed unless explicitly instructed via a command like `make 4ti2`. The package `bzip2` is listed in this group of packages that `make` will build and installed, but with a note saying that it won't be installed. (Note also that `make bzip2` will install `bzip2`, even though there is a valid system package.)

Also it would help to have a divider between the last test ("no suitable system package found for SPKG rw") and the start of the summary.

I would prefer to see something like

```
checking for library containing calculate_level... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG rw
------------
configure: build status for each package:
   4ti2-1.6.7.p0: optional; not installed by default
   alabaster-0.7.12: will be installed
   appnope-0.1.0.p0: will be installed
   arb-2.16.0.p0: no suitable system package; will be installed
   atlas-3.10.2.p3: optional; not installed by default
   ...
   bzip2-1.0.6-20150304.p0: using system package; will not be installed
   ...
```

This is a great improvement and seems to work fine on top of current develop.
I'm setting this to positive review, although I have suggestions for improvements:

- I find the trailing "##" quite distracting.
- The final output would look much cleaner if tabulated
- For standard packages without `spkg-configure.m4` it says;
  {{{
  testpath-0.4.2: does not support check for system package yet; will be installed
  }}}
  even if it is already installed; whereas for those with `spkg-configure.m4` it says
  {{{
  zeromq-4.2.5: already installed
  }}}
- Perhaps it should also be pointed out that "some" version is installed (but `make` may install a different version).
