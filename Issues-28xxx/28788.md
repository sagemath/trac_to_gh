<a id='comment:16'></a>This is a great improvement and seems to work fine on top of current develop.
I'm setting this to positive review, although I have suggestions for improvements:

- I find the trailing "##" quite distracting.
- The final output would look much cleaner if tabulated
- For standard packages without `spkg-configure.m4` it says;
  {{{
  testpath-0.4.2: does not support check for system package yet; will be installed
  }}}
  even if it is already installed; whereas for those with `spkg-configure.m4` it says
  {{{
  zeromq-4.2.5: already installed
  }}}
- Perhaps it should also be pointed out that "some" version is installed (but `make` may install a different version).
