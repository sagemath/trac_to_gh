Generally, documentation pages are reached by googling, and it would be convenient to have the Sage version number on every page of the documentation. 

While this is present on the first page of the references, on the top left corner here: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/index.html#discrete-mathematics , it is not present on every other page. For example, a random page that appeared after googling 'sage matrices': 
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/constructor.html

This would especially be convenient when previous version documentation is archived somewhere, to know what version number it corresponds to. 

For example, version 9.0 of sage has the following page for "named permutation groups": http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.html 
while an archived docpage on some other website has this, which has  a few differences from the original: https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~sorger/chow/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.html

Now, the archived version seems to be v6.4.1, found after clicking "index" on the top right: https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/~sorger/chow/html/en/reference/genindex.html

However, this is not apparent at all while looking at the docs. 

So, basically: would like to have the Sage version number on every page of the documentation somewhere.

The version number is actually in the title of the HTML page (possibly hover the tab in your browser to fully see it), but I agree it would be nice if this was more visible.

Thank you! This looks good. I'm a little new to this - so can you confirm if this is how it works?

I did a checkout ticket number, and a local branch got created. The code changes that you mention in this comment were not present in it though. 

Assuming whatever you wrote in this comment is the way to fix the issue, how does one go about fixing it?

1) Do I just make the changes on my local branch and then push?
2) How can I see how the HTML page will look locally first?
3) What are the steps for it to finally reflect in the actual documentation?

If any of those questions can be answered by just reading a resource, please just point me there. 

Thank you very much!
