psutil's Windows-related modules include some C headers that copy some Windows function and type declarations that are missing from public APIs.  However, Cygwin includes the [win32 API headers from the MinGW project](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/contribute#win32_api_and_runtime), which are more extensive.

Cygwin recently updated to MinGW-w64 7.0 which added some new structs to those headers that happen to already be redefined in psutil, so the psutil Cygwin patch needs to be updated to account for this (it still works on Cygwin installations using the older win32 headers, but for new builds this will be a problem).

This patch works on the new version of the headers, as well as an older version.  To check whether or not the patch is even relevant to your Cygwin install, run

```
$ cygcheck -s | grep 'w32api-headers'
w32api-headers                          5.0.4-1                    OK
```

This issue only affects version 7.0.0 and up.

There is no need to increase the patch level on the SPKG, because this is not a runtime issue; it only impacts building, so the patch will be needed if psutil is being built for the first time, or is being rebuilt for some other reason.
