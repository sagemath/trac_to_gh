#28721 added more documentation to the sage-dist-helpers functions used in `spkg-build` or `spkg-install` scripts.  But as evidenced by some discussion on that ticket, as well as on the mailing list, there is still some confusion about how SPKGs are built/installed, how the file manifests are generated, and what DESTDIR/staged installations are, and why the are used.
