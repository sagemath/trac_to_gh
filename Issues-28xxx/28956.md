as noticed in #27182#comment:12
it is incorrect, and always fails

```
configure:10531: checking for break
configure:10561: result: no
```
As the fail action is noop, it "works", always.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I still think this is funky. If I rename my /bin/bzip2 program, the test succeeds:

```
$ sudo mv /bin/bzip2 /bin/bzip2.bak
$ ./configure
...
configure: === checking whether to install the bzip2 SPKG ===
checking bzlib.h usability... yes
checking bzlib.h presence... yes
checking for bzlib.h... yes
checking for library containing BZ2_bzCompress... -lbz2
checking for bzip2... sage_spkg_install_bzip2=yes
...
    bzip2-1.0.6-20150304.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```

The value of the bzip2prog variable is being set to the string `sage_spkg_install_bzip2=yes` but that snippet is never actually executed.
