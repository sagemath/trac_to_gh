[This page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html) gives lists of system packages to install on common Linux distros as prerequisites for installing Sage.  E.g.,

```
# debian (Stretch or newer) / ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install binutils pixz gcc g++ gfortran make m4 perl tar \
  git patch openssl libssl-dev libz-dev bc libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libgmp-dev \
  libffi-dev libgf2x-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl yasm
```

Although it is mentioned in the docs that some Python is a prerequisite, it shouldn't be assumed (especially when setting up fresh VMs/containers for building Sage) that a Python is actually already installed.  So it would be convenient to add to the list.
