Now we have:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: A = M.mixed_form([1,0,0], name='A')
sage: 0*A
Mixed differential form 0/\A on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

Better is:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: A = M.mixed_form([1,0,0], name='A')
sage: 0*A
Mixed differential form zero on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: (0*A) is M.mixed_form_algebra().zero()
True
sage: 1*A is A
True
```

For scalar fields `is_one` is slow, because it amounts to comparing a symbolic expression to 1. For comparing to 1, we don't have the equivalent of the fast method `is_trivial_zero`.
