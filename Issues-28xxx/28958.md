The nauty package has no dependencies within sage, and we only communicate with it via popen() for now, so this should be relatively easy to pick up from the system. As far as I can tell, the following three files are the only places where a nauty executable is called:

1. src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py (directg, gentourng)
2. src/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py (geng)
3. src/sage/graphs/hypergraph_generators.py (genbg)

The loop is a little more succinct, but I have no idea what that line actually does =)

Why the empty brackets before the variable name? I tried to get away with something similar, but without different variables for geng_CHECK, directg_CHECK, etc. it doesn't work. The configure script incorrectly caches the check result based on the variable name:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the nauty SPKG ===
checking for directg... yes
checking for gentourng... (cached) yes
checking for geng... (cached) yes
checking for genbg... (cached) yes
```

Since the checks are presently very simple, I don't think it's worth increasing the magic level tenfold to eliminate a few easy-to-read lines. But maybe that equation changes when the test becomes more complicated. See my next comment...

The usual way to handle this is to test for both names, e.g. "directg" and "nauty-directg", and then to put the resulting path into a variable like NAUTY_DIRECTG. You then tell autoconf to substitute that value into a file,

```
AC_OUTPUT([ ... src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py ])
```

rename that file to src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py.in, and finally replace the hard-coded executable name with the variable:

```
sub = subprocess.Popen('@NAUTY_DIRECTG@ {0}'.format(options),
```

It would be a little ugly to separate those file names (e.g. src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py) from the rest of spkg-configure.m4, since they need to go in the top-level configure.ac, but I don't foresee any other technical problems if this sounds acceptable.

There is considerable resistance by (binary) distro people to this sort of solution.
I'd rather add an env. var. named like `SAGE_NAUTY_BIN_PREFIX` to `src/bin/sage-env-config`, which would be either `''` or `'nauty-'` and use it to compose names of executables.

Thanks, I was busy with symmetrica all day...

> There is considerable resistance by (binary) distro people to this sort of solution. I'd rather add an env. var.

Which part is objectionable? If one env var is OK, how about four env vars?

That would let us get away with only performing autoconf substitution in a single file (sage-env-config.in), but would result in a simpler implementation and would be more flexible if we ever meet a distro that uses different prefixes for different executables (e.g. if they only rename the ones that clash).

Aside from that, your version looks like it works but we wind up checking for geng twice:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the nauty SPKG ===
checking for geng... /usr/bin/geng
checking for directg... no
checking for gentourng... /usr/bin/gentourng
checking for geng... /usr/bin/geng
checking for genbg... /usr/bin/genbg

they say they don't use `./configure` to configure Sage.
This means they are OK with env vars, but not OK with `src/sage/foo/bar.py.in` files with templates.

yes, the 1st check is to figure out whether the `nauty-` prefix is there, or not.
I can remove `geng` from the list from the `foreach` loop, but this will make the
whole thing a bit more cryptic.

        [sage_spkg_install_nauty=yes GENG_PATH=geng])
  AC_SUBST(GENG_PATH)

  AC_PATH_PROGS([GENBG_PATH],[genbg nauty-genbg])
  AS_IF([test x"$GENBG_PATH" = "x"],
        [sage_spkg_install_nauty=yes GENBG_PATH=genbg])
  AC_SUBST(GENBG_PATH)

])
```

The rest of the changes are straight-forward; you'd just import the paths instead of the prefix and execute them directly.

This is not complete - it does not take into account the situation where nothing in the 2nd parameter of `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` is run, something that happens if `./configure` is run with the option `--without-system-nauty`.

So one needs four `AC_SUBST` calls in the 5th parameter of `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, as well.

There is also a possibility that some of programs in question will be prefixed, and some will be not, potentially adding to confusion...

Suppose one wrote some Sage code using nauty's `amtog` script, calling it in `subprocess.Popen("amtog...`,or whatever. Now, this will break on Debian's nauty, as it is called
`nauty-amtog` there. 

With my patch, the problem can be fixed in Python by mimicking what's done in, say,  `src/sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py` :

```python
from sage.env import SAGE_NAUTY_BINS_PREFIX as nautyprefix
...
subprocess.Popen(nautyprefix+"amtog...
```

With your patch, one would need either to do executable discovery in Python (ugly), extract the correct prefix from, say, `DIRECTG_PATH` (cursing the patch's author) and use it as above, or modify your patch by adding `amtog` to the list of four (tricky and might just be infeasible, as it modifies Sage sources).

Relying on these dependencies to be satisfied transitively can't possible work in sage-the-distribution, or any other linuxy distribution. The way we design these spkg-configure tests is to test for only the features used by the sage library. With nauty, we test for the four programs the sage library uses. With e.g. zlib, we test for a version of zlib that works with the sage library.

If someone wants to write a program that works "in sage" but which uses nauty or zlib, they can't depend on a particular interface being presented by those two package just because they "come from sage." Consider that,

1. Multiple versions of nauty and zlib (and everything else) can wind up installed to satisfy the sage dependency. New executables get added to nauty in new versions, and our configure check will match any version. If the user wants to ensure that an executable is there with a specific name, that's too much to ask -- he can't even be sure that the executable is there at all! Likewise if you want to use the public API of the zlib that comes with sage. If you want to use a newer function, you can't rely on sage's zlib to provide it, because sage will happily detect and use an old version of zlib.
2. You can't fix the first problem even if you detect an exact version in spkg-configure. Different versions of sage install different versions of its dependencies anyway, so if you build against "sage", then you're back to the problem you started with: now you need to know what version of sage is installed as a proxy for the version of the library/programs that are installed.

This is no different than it is for any other linux distribution that provides a bunch of software. If you code against "debian", and if you use a feature in a library on debian, your program is still responsible for testing the existence of that feature. There's nothing debian can do for you to present an immutable API, and sage is the same.

You've left out the best option =)

If someone writes a program against sagelib and against features of nauty that aren't a part of sagelib, then their build system has to ensure that those features are present. This is no different than writing any program that's supposed to work on any other distribution. If your code uses amtog, your build system should check for amtog.

With all that said... I don't really care if we promise more than we can deliver. I don't like that it makes the test a lot uglier than it has to be, and that we check for geng twice, but if it works (I'll build your branch tonight) I'm willing to thumbs-up it.

I think that make my argument for a default in `env.py` stronger. Using

```
var('SAGE_NAUTY_BINS_PREFIX',    '')
```
is enough to fix the issue for me and I am sure it would make Volker's bots happy.

New versions of normaliz (#27952) use libnauty as well. Provided by libnauty-dev on Debian. Not sure which other distributions provide the library too.

Should we be adding a test for libnauty to `build/pkgs/nauty/spkg-configure.m4`?
Alternatively, I could imagine creating a script package `libnauty` (depending on `nauty`) with its own `spkg-configure.m4`.
Thoughts?

yes, this seems to be more reasonable, as libnauty is only used in optional packages
