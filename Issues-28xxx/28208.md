Debian, Fedora and Conda package it, so we can use it at least on some
boxes.

The present branch runs a test known to crash an unpatched Symmetrica version, so this allows to ignore an old Symmetrica version installed on old Fedora versions (e.g. on Fedora 26).

Thanks. Is there a place I can look up the sources used (without an actual conda install)? I am trying to understand what patches are applied there by conda.

This is antic from way back in probably 2008 and 2009 when I was working with T. Abbott. I have a makefile for linux and a makefile for OS X. I only install a shared library. I should revisit it and do something to merge the makefiles.

I have the same headers than Isuru on conda. 

And I'll certainly want to steal a cmake solution from conda if it is available :) . But cmake is still not an official sage package.

It's unfortunate that sage doesn't have cmake as a standard package.

Debian has autotoolised the package, if I am not mistaken:
https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/symmetrica/blob/master/debian/patches/upstream-autotoolization.patch

Anyhow, it's easy to make cmake standard; in practice this would hopefully mean that people will use system's cmake, as we have the relevant `build/pkgs/cmake/spkg-configure.m4` already in place.

I have one issue with your CMakeList.txt

```
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
```
this should depend on the target. Sometimes it is lib64 or lib/<arch> (debian). I usually use https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/module/GNUInstallDirs.html in my own cmake scripts. My version is now here
https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/symmetrica/files/CMakeLists.txt

One thing interesting about the debian autotool patch is that it looks like they got the test working.

The following C code dumps core on old symmetrica, and works on the good one.

```c
/* compile as follows: cc tt.c -lsymmetrica -lm */

#include "symmetrica/def.h"
#include "symmetrica/macro.h"
int main() 
{
  OP b,n;
  anfang();
  n = callocobject(); b = callocobject();
  sscan_integer("4",n);
  kostka_tafel(n, b);
  println(b);
  ende();
}
```
The output should be (from the good one, and Sage's doctest in `src/sage/libs/symmetrica/kostka.pxi`):

```

[1:0:0:0:0]
[1:1:0:0:0]
[1:1:1:0:0]
[1:2:1:1:0]
[1:3:2:3:1]

```

I'll make a test in the m4 file with it.
