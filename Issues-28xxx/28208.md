Debian, Fedora and Conda package it, so we can use it at least on some
boxes.

The present branch runs a test known to crash an unpatched Symmetrica version, so this allows to ignore an old Symmetrica version installed on old Fedora versions (e.g. on Fedora 26).

This is antic from way back in probably 2008 and 2009 when I was working with T. Abbott. I have a makefile for linux and a makefile for OS X. I only install a shared library. I should revisit it and do something to merge the makefiles.

I have the same headers than Isuru on conda. 

And I'll certainly want to steal a cmake solution from conda if it is available :) . But cmake is still not an official sage package.

It is. I just made symmetrica a shared library on conda for linux, osx and windows.

It's unfortunate that sage doesn't have cmake as a standard package.

Debian has autotoolised the package, if I am not mistaken:
https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/symmetrica/blob/master/debian/patches/upstream-autotoolization.patch

Anyhow, it's easy to make cmake standard; in practice this would hopefully mean that people will use system's cmake, as we have the relevant `build/pkgs/cmake/spkg-configure.m4` already in place.

I have one issue with your CMakeList.txt

```
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
```
this should depend on the target. Sometimes it is lib64 or lib/<arch> (debian). I usually use https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/module/GNUInstallDirs.html in my own cmake scripts. My version is now here
https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/symmetrica/files/CMakeLists.txt

One thing interesting about the debian autotool patch is that it looks like they got the test working.

So it needs to be recognised and ruled out.

The following C code dumps core on old symmetrica, and works on the good one.

```c
/* compile as follows: cc tt.c -lsymmetrica -lm */

#include "symmetrica/def.h"
#include "symmetrica/macro.h"
int main() 
{
  OP b,n;
  anfang();
  n = callocobject(); b = callocobject();
  sscan_integer("4",n);
  kostka_tafel(n, b);
  println(b);
  ende();
}
```
The output should be (from the good one, and Sage's doctest in `src/sage/libs/symmetrica/kostka.pxi`):

```

[1:0:0:0:0]
[1:1:0:0:0]
[1:1:1:0:0]
[1:2:1:1:0]
[1:3:2:3:1]

```

I'll make a test in the m4 file with it.
