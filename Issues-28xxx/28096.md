The decorator ``@`cached_method(do_pickle=True)` is used to make a method to cache the result and the cached result pickled along with the object.

This fails for objects of `UniqueRepresentation` class. It is a consequence of the defective behavior of `UniqueRepresentation` object not putting its state into the pickle.

This ticket solves the problem. A discussion on this issue was in

<a id='comment:8'></a>To a reviewer:

Before this ticket, 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is not pickled 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is not pickled

With this ticket and before the last commit, 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is pickled //without the cache//

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is pickled with the cache

After the last commit,

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is not pickled

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is pickled with the cache 

This last pickling behaviour of `UniqueRepresentation` objects is somewhat halfway between the old pickling behavior of `UniqueRepresentation` objects and that of other sage objects (second behavior).

The last version seems preferable because it does not increase the size of a pickle to keep unnecessary information, namely cached function without the cache.

I think if developers do not make such spontaneous fixes, improvement of the overall quality of sage code will get slower.
