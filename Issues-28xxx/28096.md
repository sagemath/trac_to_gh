The decorator ``@`cached_method(do_pickle=True)` is used to make a method to cache the result and the cached result pickled along with the object.

This fails for objects of `UniqueRepresentation` class. It is a consequence of the defective behavior of `UniqueRepresentation` object not putting its state into the pickle.

This ticket solves the problem. A discussion on this issue was in

To a reviewer:

Before this ticket, 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is not pickled 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is not pickled

With this ticket and before the last commit, 

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is pickled //without the cache//

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is pickled with the cache

After the last commit,

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=False` (the default) is not pickled

- the cached function attached to cached method with `do_pickle=True` is pickled with the cache 

This last pickling behaviour of `UniqueRepresentation` objects is somewhat halfway between the old pickling behavior of `UniqueRepresentation` objects and that of other sage objects (second behavior).

The last version seems preferable because it does not increase the size of a pickle to keep unnecessary information, namely cached function without the cache.

Right. This is nothing to do with the purpose of the ticket. You know that this import statement is not necessary any more since python 2.7. It happens that as I am writing a patch for a ticket, I encounter things to be easily fixed, like obvious typos, docstrings in bad style, unnecessary imports (like the above) and so on. Sometimes I fix them. Other times I pass them.

I think if developers do not make such spontaneous fixes, improvement of the overall quality of sage code will get slower.

This (and many others like this) was related with the ticket. Without this reordering, I got doctest failures. But strangely but happily, now with 8.9.beta5, I don't have them any more even without reordering. I will revert back these changes.

I might be wrong, but I think this is still needed in Python 2.7, as I have recently had to add the statement in one of my own projects to solve a problem that did not exist with Python 3.
