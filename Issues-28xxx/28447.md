Mainly for better speed and also smaller memory usage.

* New lazy attributes of Hasse diagrams: `_leq_storage` and `_leq_matrix_boolean`. The first one contains a list of sets describing the comparison relation. The second attribute now calls this data.

* Previous lazy attribute `_leq_matrix` is computed from the `_leq_storage` data.

* method `lequal_matrix` calls either, with unchanged default behaviour

* New algorithm for `_leq_storage` that tries to outsmart the naive transitive closure, by leveraging the poset structure and the known linear extension

<a id='comment:1'></a>For small posets: after, one gets

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 623 µs, sys: 7 µs, total: 630 µs
Wall time: 634 µs
```
and before, one got

```
sage: sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
....: sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
....: sage: %time H.lequal_matrix()
....: 
CPU times: user 328 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 328 µs
Wall time: 332 µs
```
so there is a loss here.

For larger posets, there is a gain. This needs to be investigated.

After:

....: sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
....: sage: %time H.lequal_matrix()
....: 
CPU times: user 537 µs, sys: 10 µs, total: 547 µs
Wall time: 556 µs
```
So there is now a small progress in that case.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I noticed some mild speedups across the board:

Before:

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 1.23 ms, sys: 158 µs, total: 1.39 ms
Wall time: 1.28 ms

sage: P = posets.CoxeterGroupAbsoluteOrderPoset(CoxeterGroup(['B',4]))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 65.2 ms, sys: 4.05 ms, total: 69.2 ms
Wall time: 64 ms

sage: P = posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset(6)
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 966 ms, sys: 36.3 ms, total: 1 s
Wall time: 981 ms
```
After:

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 1.11 ms, sys: 105 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 1.05 ms

sage: P = posets.CoxeterGroupAbsoluteOrderPoset(CoxeterGroup(['B',4]))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 67.4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 67.4 ms
Wall time: 63.8 ms

sage: P = posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset(6)
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 921 ms, sys: 20.1 ms, total: 941 ms
Wall time: 937 ms
```
