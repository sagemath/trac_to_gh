We implement the following methods:
- `maximum_cardinality_search` (MCS) graph traversal -- `O(n + m)`
- `maximum_cardinality_search_M` (MCS-M) graph traversal, an extension of MCS that also returns a minimal triangulation -- `O(n.m)`
- `atoms_and_clique_separators`, a method that decompose the graph according clique minimal separators and returns the atoms and the clique minimal separators -- `O(n.m)`

These methods can be used for instance as preprocessing for tree-decompositions (treewidth, treelength, etc.).

In this ticket, we also make `lex_M` a method of `Graph` instead of `GenericGraph` as this method is for undirected graphs only.

Here are my comments:

I think it is better to have the import grouped:

```diff
-    from sage.graphs.traversals import lex_M
-    from sage.graphs.traversals import maximum_cardinality_search
-    from sage.graphs.traversals import maximum_cardinality_search_M
+    from sage.graphs.traversals import (lex_M, maximum_cardinality_search,
+                                        maximum_cardinality_search_M)
```
You can do the same thing for `cimport` as well IIRC.

I don't know if Cython is smart enough to break this up (which means you'll have to look at the C code), but I am a little dubious about this line:

```
Sc.extend(res[2 if separators else 1])
```
and I think you will get better C code if you do

```
if separators:
    Sc.extend(res[2])
else:
    Sc.extend(res[1])
```

In `atoms_and_clique_separators`, since you use `H[x]` a lot, it probably would be good to define a variable for it. Same for `H[x].size()`. I think it also would be good to pull out

```python
            # Check if the subgraph of G[H[x]] is a clique
            stop = False
            for ui in range(H[x].size() -1):
                u = H[x][ui]
                for vi in range(ui + 1, H[x].size()):
                    if not has_edge(sd, u, H[x][vi]):
                        stop = True
                        break
                if stop:
                    break
            else:
```
into a separate `cdef inline` helper function (which does not need doctests).

```diff
-    OUPUT: by default, return the ordering `\alpha` as a list. When ``tree`` is
+    OUTPUT:
+
+    By default, return the ordering `\alpha` as a list. When ``tree`` is
     ``True``, the method returns a tuple `(\alpha, T)`, where `T` is a directed
     tree with the same set of vertices as `G`and a directed edge from `u` to `v`
     if `u` was the first vertex to saw `v`.
```

```diff
-    for i in range(G.order()):
+    for i in range(N):
```
