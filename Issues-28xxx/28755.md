This ticket improves the build error summary printed by `build/make/install`:
- timestamps of the log files are shown, and packages are sorted chronologically by build time
- build directory names are only printed if the directories still exist
- some alignment for prettier output
- rephrasing a message to make it clear that log files and build directories can be safely deleted.

Example output:

```
Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make xyzzy'):

* package:         sage_numerical_backends_gurobi-9.0b9
  last build time: Dec 25 10:52
  log file:        /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/logs/pkgs/sage_numerical_backends_gurobi-9.0b9.log

* package:         sage_numerical_backends_cplex-9.0b9
  last build time: Dec 25 10:52
  log file:        /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/logs/pkgs/sage_numerical_backends_cplex-9.0b9.log

* package:         sage_numerical_backends_gurobi-9.0b12
  last build time: Jan 12 18:53
  log file:        /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/logs/pkgs/sage_numerical_backends_gurobi-9.0b12.log
  build directory: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/sage_numerical_backends_gurobi-9.0b12

* package:         gcc-9.2.0
  last build time: Jan 24 10:45
  log file:        /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/logs/pkgs/gcc-9.2.0.log
  build directory: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gcc-9.2.0

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the
environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.

I don't see any good reason to print the contents of the build directory:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):

For most users, the log file has the relevant information.

For the timestamp itself, in principle it's a good idea, but using `ls -l` gives extraneous information, and unfortunately it's the first information printed: file permissions, owner, group, etc. The most important thing is the location of the file, second is the timestamp.

Now I see this, which I like better:

```
Error building Sage.

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they

WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the

environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.

However I do not like the error message
