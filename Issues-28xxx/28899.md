I removed the period.

This is my review:

- I doubt if this

```
idx = index[l + 1]
if (i == len(expo) - 1 or expo[i + 1][idx:] != cur_exp[idx:]): 
```
 is better than the original code

```
if (i == len(expo) - 1 or expo[i+1][index[l+1]:] != cur_exp[index[l+1]:]):  
```

 On one hand, python should be clever enough to do the obvious optimization. On the other hand, computing `idx` is unnecessary if the first condition is met.

- You may want to put spaces around `+` here

```
            sage: f = H([z^2+c])  
```

- You may want to make modifications here as well

```
        INPUT:

        -  ``gfan_polyhedral_fan`` - output from ``gfan`` of a
           polyhedral fan.
        -  ``polynomial_system`` - a list of polynomials
        -  ``poly_ring`` - the polynomial ring of the list of polynomials
        -  ``parameters`` (optional) - a list of variables to be considered as parameters
  ```

All other changes look good to me.
