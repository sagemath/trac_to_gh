We use `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to compute the graph of `Polyhedron_base`.

In the case of polyhedra with `lines` aka unpointed polyhedra this changes the behavior:

- Old behavior: The vertex graph basically ignored the lines, so that

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=my_vertices, rays=my_rays, lines=my_lines)
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=my_vertices, rays=my_rays)
```
  have the same graph (assuming the Vrepresentation as `['my_vertices', 'my_rays', 'my_lines']` is minimal).
- New behavior: The vertex graph of a polyhedron with lines contains no vertices as the polyhedron as no vertices.

We add information about this to the documentation of `vertex_graph`.

We alter a doctest in `combinatorial_automorphism_group` that assumed the old behavior.

What do we do with polyhedra that contain lines?

As of now it is understood that in this case the vertex_graph is non-empty. So the vertex graph is basically the one of the projection.

However, the docstring of `vertex_graph` states that the edges correspond to edges of the polyhedron. I find it very confusing that the `vertex_graph` of an unpointed polyhedron should have edges.

If people think this is the way it should be than the docstring of `vertex_graph` should be more precise.

I stumbled upon this because I got a test failure at
`File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py", line 7229`

```
7225         Permutations can only exchange vertices with vertices, rays
7226         with rays, and lines with lines::
7227 
7228             sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0,0), (1,1,0)], rays=[(1,0,0)], lines=[(0,0,1)])
7229             sage: P.combinatorial_automorphism_group(vertex_graph_only=True)
7230             Permutation Group with generators [(A vertex at (1,0,0),A vertex at (1,1,0))]
```

This is a weird test, as it tests a behavior which seems to be opposed to the intention of `vertex_graph`.  Also the announcement is strange, as the `vertex_graph` contains neither rays nor lines and thus will not interchange them (not even a ray with a ray).

Sorry about the confusion. This ticket is built on top of #28603 and #28621. Only the last commit is due to this ticket.

In `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, I chose to implement a method `edge_graph`. In order to make it more compatible with `Polyhedron` I replace it by `vertex_graph` in #28603.

This way `CombinatorialPolyhedron(P).vertex_graph()` gives the vertex graph of our polyhedron `P`.

There are two issues with edge graph:
- It has no vertices if there are no edges (a 0-dimensional polyhedron).
- It depends not just on the combinatorial type, for example those two 

```
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0],[0,1]],rays=[[1,11/10],[11/10,1]]); Q
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 2 rays
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0],[0,1]],rays=[[1,1]]); P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray
```
  polyhedra do not have isomorphic `edge_graph`s in `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.
