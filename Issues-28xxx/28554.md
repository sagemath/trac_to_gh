How is a scalar field implemented which is piecewisely defined with different expressions in one particular chart?

Take for instance a scalar field `f` on the real line with standard "top" chart `x`, defined via `f(x)=0 for x<-1`, `f(x)=x+1 for -1<=x<0`, `f(x)=1-x for 0<=x<1` and `f(x)=0 for x>=1`. Currently, this is solved by using

```
f = M.scalar_field( unit_step(x + 1)*unit_step(1 - x)*(1 - abs(x)) )
```
(see #28519#comment:46).

This solution is quite unhandy and becomes even more so for more complicated scalar fields.

This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519.

**This ticket includes:**

- `display` method modified in such a way that all distinct expressions are shown (a small slowdown in computation time)
- `set_restriction` method added smilar to tensor fields

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>Sorry for the delay. The ticket looks good; it clearly improves the treatment of restrictions of scalar fields. I have a few remarks:\n- Regarding the change in `display()`, I agree that your solution is a good compromise\n- I guess the method `_new_instance()` has been introduced in scalar fields by analogy of what is done for tensor fields. However in the present case, this method is quite trivial, since it returns a mere `type(self)(self.parent())`. IMHO this adds some code complexity (a new method) for not a big gain; for someone reading the code, \n\n```\n   res = type(self)(self.parent())\n```\n  is at least as clear as\n\n```\n   res = self._new_instance()\n```\n   Moreover the latter involves one extra function call. Therefore I would suggest to revert this change.\n- When you perform significant changes/additions to some file, I would suggest that you add your name to the `AUTHORS` field and copyright statement. For instance in `src/sage/mnifolds/scalarfield.py`, you could add to the `AUTHORS` field something like \n\n```\n- Michael Jung (2019) : improve restrictions; make ``display()`` show all\n  distinct expressions\n```\n  The same holds for #28628 and other tickets of #28519.",

<a id='comment:12'></a>Sorry for the delay. The ticket looks good; it clearly improves the treatment of restrictions of scalar fields. I have a few remarks:
- Regarding the change in `display()`, I agree that your solution is a good compromise
- I guess the method `_new_instance()` has been introduced in scalar fields by analogy of what is done for tensor fields. However in the present case, this method is quite trivial, since it returns a mere `type(self)(self.parent())`. IMHO this adds some code complexity (a new method) for not a big gain; for someone reading the code, 

```
   res = type(self)(self.parent())
```
  is at least as clear as

```
   res = self._new_instance()
```
   Moreover the latter involves one extra function call. Therefore I would suggest to revert this change.
- When you perform significant changes/additions to some file, I would suggest that you add your name to the `AUTHORS` field and copyright statement. For instance in `src/sage/mnifolds/scalarfield.py`, you could add to the `AUTHORS` field something like 

```
- Michael Jung (2019) : improve restrictions; make ``display()`` show all
  distinct expressions
```
  The same holds for #28628 and other tickets of #28519.
