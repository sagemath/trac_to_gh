I confirm: with Sage 8.7, running 

```
./sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules pdf
```
yields a pdf file with the references properly set. It fails with Sage 8.8.beta7 and later versions.

I think you can modify this and not do any changes in the `sphinxcite{...}` commands:

```
\usepackage{xcite}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\externaldocument[../references/]{../references/references}
\externalcitedocument[../references/]{../references/references}
% These lines must appear before \usepackage{hyperref}.
```
These commands take an optional argument which specifies the prefix used in their citations. Then `\sphinxcite{../references/index:mil1958}` will be converted to `index:mil1958`, which should then be looked up in the master bibliography file. This renders as plain text `[Mil1958]`, but maybe that's the best you can hope for: PDF files shouldn't have live links to other PDF files, should they? Is that what we would want?

Maybe the best solution would be if Sphinx magically extracted the relevant citations and included only those in each PDF file, but I don't know how to do that. Maybe we can convert our master bibliography file into a BibTeX `.bib` file and use that?

Excellent! I may be incorrect, but I think LaTeX parses `../references/references.aux` to get bibliographical info. I had thought about the BibTeX approach but that will require some significant work. If this is to work then four lines will have to be inserted into each .tex file by Sphinx. Sphinx auto-generates the files. But where?

I think this is because the citation is in one pdf and the actual bibliographic entry is in another pdf. I don't know if \hyperref can be made to work across pdf files.

I think a problem with this is that combinat.tex will want to access graphs.aux, which won't be ready until graphs.tex is compiled, while graphs.tex will want to access combinat.aux. So there is no good order to process these.

Regarding #27497: it's going to be a lot tedious work to do this (speaking from experience, since I have moved most of Sage's other references to the master bibliography file). I don't want to do it. Fortunately, for the purposes of this ticket, we only need to move a few references: the ones in combinat that are used elsewhere and the ones in graphs that are used elsewhere.

Converting to bibtex will also be a lot of work. A program like [bibweb](https://github.com/jhpalmieri/bibweb) might help a bit, but who wants to convert all of the current references to bibtex format? I'm certainly not going to stand in anyone's way, but the task is almost too tedious to even consider.

Oh, there is also [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-bibtex/), but note [this issue](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#unresolved-citations-across-documents).

On a sage-on-gentoo build I see things like

```
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/xcite/xcite.sty
Package: xcite 2011/09/02 v1.0 eXternal Citations (EG)
)
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hyperref/xr-hyper.sty
Package: xr-hyper 2000/03/22 v6.00beta4 eXternal References (DPC)
)

Package xr Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.
 on input line 35.

Package xc Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.
 on input line 35.
``` 
I don't see any reason why this couldn't happen with vanilla sage. For the proposed fix to work it is necessary that the stuff under `../references/*` be built and I don't see any way to insure that, especially if things are built in parallel.
