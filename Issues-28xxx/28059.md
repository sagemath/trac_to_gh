where there are citations missing on the first page of chapter one.

On the other hand, "improper" (to be fixed, I suppose) in-file references such as

I confirm: with Sage 8.7, running 

```
./sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules pdf

yields a pdf file with the references properly set. It fails with Sage 8.8.beta7 and later versions.

It appears that `\sphinxcite` is just an alias to `\cite`, and thus its argument is treated in a normal way, i.e. one would need 
`\bibitem[Lee2011]{index:lee2011}` to become 

`\bibitem[Lee2011]{../references/index:lee2011}` 

in addition to the knowledge about the location of this `bibitem` to be properly passed.
(something what in "normal" latex would be in a parameter to `\bibliography{}`.

I think you can modify this and not do any changes in the `sphinxcite{...}` commands:

```
\usepackage{xcite}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\externaldocument[../references/]{../references/references}
\externalcitedocument[../references/]{../references/references}

Excellent! I may be incorrect, but I think LaTeX parses `../references/references.aux` to get bibliographical info. I had thought about the BibTeX approach but that will require some significant work. If this is to work then four lines will have to be inserted into each .tex file by Sphinx.

A untested shorter term fix is to add more `\externalcitedocument[...]{...}` commands.

It's probably best to go with #27497 - it's the easiest.
I also think we should indeed convert the thing to bibtex 

(who was the genius who thought that free from meta-information format for citations is OK :-))

I think a problem with this is that combinat.tex will want to access graphs.aux, which won't be ready until graphs.tex is compiled, while graphs.tex will want to access combinat.aux. So there is no good order to process these.

Regarding #27497: it's going to be a lot tedious work to do this (speaking from experience, since I have moved most of Sage's other references to the master bibliography file). I don't want to do it. Fortunately, for the purposes of this ticket, we only need to move a few references: the ones in combinat that are used elsewhere and the ones in graphs that are used elsewhere.

On a sage-on-gentoo build I see things like

```
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/xcite/xcite.sty
Package: xcite 2011/09/02 v1.0 eXternal Citations (EG)
)
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hyperref/xr-hyper.sty
Package: xr-hyper 2000/03/22 v6.00beta4 eXternal References (DPC)
)

Package xr Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.
 on input line 35.

Package xc Warning:
No file ../references/references.aux
LABELS NOT IMPORTED.
 on input line 35.
``` 
I don't see any reason why this couldn't happen with vanilla sage. For the proposed fix to work it is necessary that the stuff under `../references/*` be built and I don't see any way to insure that, especially if things are built in parallel.
