```
In Sage 8.6, but also Sage 9.6.beta3:

```
sage: taylor(sqrt(x+2), x, 2, 3)
1/512*(x - 2)^3 - 1/64*(x - 2)^2 + 1/4*x + 3/2
```

This seems to have constant term `3/2`,
although `sqrt(x+2)` is `2` for `x = 2`.

The result is in fact correct but one would
expect the linear term to be written as
`a*(x - 2) + b`, not as `a*x + b`.

Oh, you're right, I overlooked it. It's little confusing to provide the result in such a “mixed” form.
