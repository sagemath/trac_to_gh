The definition of `inverse_mod(x, I)` for the class `CommutativeRingElement` always raises a `NotImplementedError`. It would be better to return the correct value in the easy cases (when `x` is a unit, or `x` is in `I`). This would provide a complete implementation for fields.

Depends on #28969

The error message `Impossible inverse modulo` is a little strange to me, and moreover from the ticket description, it does not seem correct. Could we instead change it to

```
raise NotImplementedError("unable to compute the inverse modulo this ideal")
```

On #28969, it would have been good to also remove that period at the end of it in order to follow Python's error message convention. Oh well, that already has a positive review...

However, this is a `ValueError`, not a `NotImplementedError`, because the inverse does not exist. (This error message is for the case where x is in I and I is not the entire ring. Since x is in I, we have <x,I> = I. Also, if the inverse of x modulo I exists, then <x,I>  must be the entire ring. So I = <x,I> is the entire ring, which is a contradiction.)

Being a beginner at sagemath development, I thought I should copy an error message, instead of making up my own, but, since you agree that it is weird, I will change it. However, this is a `ValueError`, not a `NotImplementedError`, because the inverse does not exist. (This error message is for the case where x is in I and I is not the entire ring. Since x is in I, we have <x,I> = I. Also, if the inverse of x modulo I exists, then <x,I>  must be the entire ring. So I = <x,I> is the entire ring, which is a contradiction.)  I changed the error message to

```
raise ValueError("An element of a proper ideal does not have an inverse modulo that ideal")
```
