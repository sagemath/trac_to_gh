Hello,

After looking at this ticket in detail I am unsure of the desired changes.
When the parameters `loops` and `multiedges` have their default value (`None`), graphs built from an integer or a list of edges are already loopless and simple. From `graphs.py`:

```python
        elif format == 'int':
            self.allow_loops(bool(loops), check=False)
            self.allow_multiple_edges(bool(multiedges), check=False)
            ...
```
and

```python
        elif format == 'list_of_edges':
            self.allow_multiple_edges(bool(multiedges), check=False)
            self.allow_loops(bool(loops), check=False)
            ...
```

(Similar for digraphs.) It was changed in #15706 when removing the deprecation warning.

However having `loops=False` and `multiedges=False` by default seems dangerous because it will break the detection of the parameters when the graph is given, for instance, as an adjacency matrix:

```
sage: Graph(matrix([[0,2],[2,0]]))
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph(matrix([[1,2],[2,1]]))
Looped multi-graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph(matrix([[1,0],[0,1]]))
Looped graph on 2 vertices
```
But

```
sage: Graph(matrix([[1,0],[0,1]]), loops=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: the adjacency matrix of a loopless graph must have zeroes on the diagonal
```
Similarily, when ones creates a graph from a sparse6 string, they have no obvious way to guess whether the graph has mutliedges/loops or not. (Currently loops and multiedges are allowed by default in this case.)

You are perfectly right, I did not though about these cases. Thanks.

So may be we can set this ticket to invalid.
