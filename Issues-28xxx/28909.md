#17420 added `AX_CHECK_ROOT`, which refuses to configure a sage build as root, as a safety measure protecting users from getting themselves into trouble with `sudo make`.

On containers, however, building as root is quite natural. We provide an option ``--enable-build-as-root``. (Then we fix all related build system bugs that stop this from working)
This would allow us to simplify `docker/Dockerfile`, which currently works around it: 

```
# Sage refuses to build as root, so we add a "sage" user that can sudo without a password.
# We also want this user at runtime as some commands in sage know about the user that was used during build.
ARG HOME=/home/sage
RUN adduser --quiet --shell /bin/bash --gecos "Sage user,101,," --disabled-password --home "$HOME" sage \
    && echo "sage ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/01-sage \
    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/01-sage
# Run everything from now on as the sage user in sage's home
USER sage
ENV HOME $HOME
```
For example, GitHub Actions do not like Docker containers that make use of the `USER` command:  https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#docker-container-filesystem

I think in this discussion, one should distinguish building sage from running sage:
- I think building sage as root in the container is unproblematic.
- A docker image intended to provide a ready to use jupyter server clearly has no business of running that sever as root; in fact, perhaps it should actually be running as a less privileged user than the one that owns the sage installation... 
- There is value in having a Docker image in which sagemath is installed as root in `/usr/local` and no special preparations such as users or entrypoints are made. This image would then be easy to use in [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) actions or similar contexts. (Right now I am using conda to set up such a Docker image for my purposes - but it would be nice to have an official Docker image of sagemath that is built from source.)

True.

Yes, but it probably does not win you much.

Some people want to be able to pip install things for example. For this it makes sense to own the Sage installation. (without being root.)

I agree but having a separate image comes at a significant maintenance cost.
