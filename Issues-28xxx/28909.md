#17420 added `AX_CHECK_ROOT`, which refuses to configure a sage build as root, as a safety measure protecting users from getting themselves into trouble with `sudo make`.

On containers, however, building as root is quite natural. We provide an option ``--enable-build-as-root``. (Then we fix all related build system bugs that stop this from working)
This would allow us to simplify `docker/Dockerfile`, which currently works around it: 

```
# Sage refuses to build as root, so we add a "sage" user that can sudo without a password.
# We also want this user at runtime as some commands in sage know about the user that was used during build.
ARG HOME=/home/sage
RUN adduser --quiet --shell /bin/bash --gecos "Sage user,101,," --disabled-password --home "$HOME" sage \
    && echo "sage ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/01-sage \
    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/01-sage
# Run everything from now on as the sage user in sage's home
USER sage
ENV HOME $HOME
```
For example, GitHub Actions do not like Docker containers that make use of the `USER` command:  https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#docker-container-filesystem

I think in this discussion, one should distinguish building sage from running sage:
- I think building sage as root in the container is unproblematic.
- A docker image intended to provide a ready to use jupyter server clearly has no business of running that sever as root; in fact, perhaps it should actually be running as a less privileged user than the one that owns the sage installation... 
- There is value in having a Docker image in which sagemath is installed as root in `/usr/local` and no special preparations such as users or entrypoints are made. This image would then be easy to use in [GitHub](GitHub) actions or similar contexts. (Right now I am using conda to set up such a Docker image for my purposes - but it would be nice to have an official Docker image of sagemath that is built from source.)

Yes, but it probably does not win you much.
