```
When activating the sage environment (e.g. with `sage -sh`) for some reason (I'm not sure what the motivation is - but cf. #14296, where this was set up) it sets the `AS` environment variable by calling

```
$CC -print-file-name=as
```
and likewise with `LD`.

In my case this command is just returning the strings `as` and `ld` without a full path.

However, when I run `./configure` in this environment I get output like:

```
checking g++ version... 7.4.0
configure: Installing GCC because there is a mismatch of assemblers
configure:   g++ -std=gnu++11 -std=gnu++11 uses /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-cygwin/7.4.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-cygwin/bin/as.exe
configure:   $AS equal to as
configure: Installing GCC because there is a mismatch of linkers
configure:   g++ -std=gnu++11 -std=gnu++11 uses /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-cygwin/7.4.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-cygwin/bin/ld.exe
configure:   $LD equal to ld
```

and, in turn, sage will try to build its own gcc.

Yes, as you say it should probably use `-print-prog-name` instead; I wonder if that was something that changed in gcc at one point.

However, that still doesn't answer why `sage-env` sets those variables too, which seems unnecessary...

Interesting--for some reason I wasn't able to reproduce this problem on my local Windows development build, but I was on Sage installed by the Windows installer.  It turns out this almost already works because the current code in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` reads like:

```
    if test -n "$AS"; then
        CXX_as=`$CXX -print-prog-name=as 2>/dev/null`
        CXX_as=`command -v $CXX_as 2>/dev/null`
        cmd_AS=`command -v $AS`

        if ! (test "$CXX_as" = "" -o "$CXX_as" -ef "$cmd_AS"); then
            SAGE_SHOULD_INSTALL_GCC([there is a mismatch of assemblers])
            AC_MSG_NOTICE([  $CXX uses $CXX_as])
            AC_MSG_NOTICE([  \$AS equal to $AS])
        fi
    fi
```

The tricky part is in the `test ... $CXX_as -ef $cmd_AS`.  I didn't know this but the `-ef` flag means the two files have the same device and inode number.  In my case I had

```
CXX_as=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-cygwin/7.4.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-cygwin/bin/as.exe
cmd_AS=/usr/bin/as
```

but it turns out this test is *true* in my case, so `/usr/bin/as` must be a hard link to the real `as.exe`.  However, after being bundled into the installer and then unpacked the two files are just copies of each other--oops.  Right now the build of the Windows installer does not have a good way to preserve hard links.

Nevertheless, the fact that this happens to work on my Cygwin install is a happy accident.  I think this is still an issue, and the fix is the same.
