The method affine hull does not preserve backend, when `orthogonal` or `orthonormal` is `True`.

We fix this.

`normaliz` should be able to handle most base rings that appear with this method, so this is mostly usefull for the backend `normaliz`.

It looks good to me.
I will put it on positive review once the patchbots are done.
