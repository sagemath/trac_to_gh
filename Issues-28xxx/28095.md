This ticket adds options such as `--enable-lrslib`, `--enable-topcom` for all optional and experimental packages to `configure`. As per `configure --help`:

```
  ...
  --enable-lie={no|if_installed|yes}
                          enable build and use of the experimental package lie
                          (default: "if_installed")
                          package information: ./sage -info lie
  --disable-lie           disable build and uninstall if previously installed
                          by Sage in PREFIX; same as --enable-lie=no
  ...
```

Subsequent `make` will then install or uninstall these packages.

This is an interface alternative to `sage -i OPTIONALSPKG` / `make OPTIONALSPKG` and `make OPTIONALSPKG-clean`.

This will simplify installations of sage with a list of optional packages. 

(This was previously discussed in #21538, which did not clearly enough distinguish this proposal from the topic of using system packages, #27567.)

Follow-up: 
- #29113: Reimplement `sage -i SPKG` as `configure --enable-SPKG && make build`

Yes, you could do it during bootstrap, in principle.

I have tried in the past to get m4 itself to loop over package directories and generate this stuff (as opposed to the current approach of generating bits of m4 in `./bootstrap`).  And in principle that can work, but other, higher-level tools like automake get terribly confused when you try to do too much weird stuff like this.

Very nice! It works, but I don't like that ./configure does not output which packages are tagged for installation/deletion.

That's caused by another misclassification, for historical reasons, of package types (like the one for `gfortran` fixed in #29053).

```
$ cat build/pkgs/gmp/type 
optional
$ cat build/pkgs/mpir/type 
optional
```
These should actually be `standard` - they are mutually exclusive standard packages.
