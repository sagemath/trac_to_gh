```
On Python 3 this check does not guarantee that `exp` fits into a C `long`, and the `PyInt_AS_LONG` can fail (actually, silently fail and return `long_exp = -1`). These cause test failures on 32-bit Python 3 builds but are also wrong on 64-bit:

```
     if type(exp) is int:
        long_exp = PyInt_AS_LONG(exp)
```
There are also a few instances where hashing is different in 32-bit py2 and py3.

I'm no sage expert, but this looks wrong to me, python 3 does not define "long", so afaict unless something in safe defines it instead or there is some subtlely of cython that i'm not aware of this will fail with a NameError.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Cython just translates 
* `isinstance(x, int)` to `PyInt_Check`
* `isinstance(x, long)` to `PyLong_Check`
Now `PyInt_Check` is indeed gone from the Python 3 C API, but Cython handily emits

```
#if PY_MAJOR_VERSION >= 3
  #define PyInt_Check(op)              PyLong_Check(op)
```
So as long as the Cython code gets translated to C you can still use `long` (and its the same as a Python int when compiling with Python 3). Kind of a weird feature but without it you'd be hard pressed to write any 2&3 compatible Cython code...
