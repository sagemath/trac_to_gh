"For now" are dangerous words, though, in particular regarding matrix input and `automatic_names`.  I'm certainly glad that both 3d viewers seem to work in Jupyter now, though I haven't yet built with py3 support.

The switch to Python 3 needs to happen. To get these issues fixed, people need to work on them, and if no one is working on them (as seems to be the case), that isn't reason enough to delay the switch to Python 3.

Even though `sagenb` is now optional, it is still always installed because it is a dependency for building the documentation. Look at line 4 in the following, from `build/make/deps`:

```
# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
DOC_DEPENDENCIES = sagelib $(inst_sphinx) $(inst_sagenb) \
	| $(SAGERUNTIME) $(inst_maxima) $(inst_networkx) $(inst_scipy) $(inst_sympy) \
	$(inst_matplotlib) $(inst_pillow) $(inst_mathjax) $(inst_mpmath) \
	$(inst_ipykernel) $(inst_jupyter_client) $(inst_conway_polynomials) \
	$(inst_tachyon) $(inst_jmol) $(inst_thebe) $(inst_ipywidgets) $(inst_typing)
```
Should we create another followup to deal with this? I can do it, but it may take me a few days, because I have other higher priority things I have to do first.
