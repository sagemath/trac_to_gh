Even though `sagenb` is now optional, it is still always installed because it is a dependency for building the documentation. Look at line 4 in the following, from `build/make/deps`:

```
# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
DOC_DEPENDENCIES = sagelib $(inst_sphinx) $(inst_sagenb) \
	| $(SAGERUNTIME) $(inst_maxima) $(inst_networkx) $(inst_scipy) $(inst_sympy) \
	$(inst_matplotlib) $(inst_pillow) $(inst_mathjax) $(inst_mpmath) \
	$(inst_ipykernel) $(inst_jupyter_client) $(inst_conway_polynomials) \
	$(inst_tachyon) $(inst_jmol) $(inst_thebe) $(inst_ipywidgets) $(inst_typing)
```
Should we create another followup to deal with this? I can do it, but it may take me a few days, because I have other higher priority things I have to do first.
