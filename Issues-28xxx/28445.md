This is part of #27497.

One should also add DOI to all these references.

The attached file is the output from command `grep -R "\.\.[ ]* \[" src/sage/combinat` and then deleting a few false positives (thus it is an update of the file attached to #27497 after #28105).

Component: **documentation**
