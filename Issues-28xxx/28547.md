I'd like something slightly different probably because I painted myself in that corner years ago :)

In sage-on-gentoo SAGE_SHARE is `/usr/share/sage`, that is proper sage only object in share. It is not just /usr/share. I don't want those

directly in `/usr/share` especially with generic names like `ext` and `graphs`. But vanilla sage is expecting `SAGE_LOCAL/share` which leads to some intense patching in `env.py`. The point here is that I have 

```
mathjax_relative = '../mathjax'
```
in sage-on-gentoo not plain `mathjax`. I would favor `os.path.relpath(MATHJAX_DIR,SAGE_SHARE)`. which means that you also have to restore SAGE_SHARE in the `from sage.env`.
