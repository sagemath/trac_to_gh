For lattice polytopes, the Ehrhart polynomial may now be computed using either `latte_int` or `normaliz`  as the engine. As the dimension of the polytope increases, `latte_int` appears to be much faster at computing the Ehrhart polynomial.

For example, below is a table comparing computation times of the Ehrhart polynomial for a dilated simplex. It was computed using `time.time()` by subtracting a start time from an end time::

```
for i in range(2,11):
p = i * polytopes.simplex(i,backend = 'normaliz')
```
| Dimension | Normaliz | Latte |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| 2  | 0.0005509853363037109  | 0.0 | 
| 3  | 0.0008060932159423828  | 0.0 |
| 4  | 0.0011680126190185547  | 0.0 |
| 5  | 0.0013370513916015625  | 0.0 |
| 6  |    0.0030059814453125  | 0.0 |
| 7  |  0.009865999221801758  | 0.0 |

| 11 |    774.3957607746124   | 0.0 |

This could motivate making `latte_int` the default engine for Ehrhart polynomial computations of lattice polytopes and continuing to maintain `latte_int` as an engine.

I am not sure what you are computing. I have just done the Ehrhart series for a cube of dimension 10 on my laptop in native Normaliz: 2.8 sec whereas you seem to get 45 sec in dimension 6 already.

The cubes have many vertices, but they are all simple and even unimodular.
