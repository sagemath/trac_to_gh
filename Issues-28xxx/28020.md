```
The `AX_CHECK_ZLIB` macro (and by extension the `AX_CHECK_LIBLZMA` macro which is just a copy of it) has an annoyance where if it detects a system zlib, it will *permanently* (i.e. for the remainder of the configure script) set some variables like `CPPFLAGS=-I${ZLIB_HOME}/include`.

So if this sets `CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include` this will be added to all checks for the rest of the configure script, and break some.

This particularly created bugs when building in a conda build environment as pointed out by Isuru.  

We could work around this in a number of ways, such as modifying those macros, or even possibly just putting some `AC_PUSH/POP_LANG` around it.

Do I just do `conda activate` and proceed as if it's a "normal" system?

To clarify, although I don't know exactly the steps to reproduce it, I was able to sit with Isuru here at Cernay and see for myself that it was happening.

I later modified the configure script directly to try to trace in what places `CFLAGS` and/or `LDFLAGS` were being modified and not restored, and I tracked it down to zlib; and indeed looking at the code you can see that it is doing that in some cases.

We confirmed that passing `--with-system-zlib=no` and `--with-system-xz=no` alleviated the problem.

Which, I think Isuru noted, is okay because the sage package for conda is patching sage to not install any spkgs in the first place, of course.

But it's still necessary to run Sage's `configure`, and this problem causes `configure` to fail (since it leads to other library detections erroring out in unexpected ways).

It doesn't fail configure, it just makes sage not use other packages in conda afterwards. This issue doesn't prevent building sage with conda=build, but is an issue with using conda dependencies to build sage outside of conda-build.
