<a id='comment:3'></a>I have cythonized the Yen and Feng's methods here as can be seen from the last commit in the list of above commits.

In short I have used cython variables and cython data structures where ever possible in these methods.

Also I have named the cython methods as yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_cython and feng_k_shortest_simple_paths_cython to separate them from yen_k_shortest_simple_paths and feng_k_shortest_simple_paths for consistency and speed checks.
feng_k_shortest_simple_paths
Changes will be more clear once #27859 gets included.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Seems correct.
The next step is to speed up the test `hash_path not in idx_to_path.values()`, but I don't have good ideas yet on how to do that.

Actual algorithm never specify to do this test. I added this test thinking that a path may be repeated in the heap, but the way Yen's algorithm unfolds its not possible to add the same path twice.
