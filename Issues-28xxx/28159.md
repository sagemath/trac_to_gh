Implementation of topological and differentiable vector bundles over manifolds.

**Features:**

- abstract vector bundles on topological manifolds
- trivializations
- local frames
- simple sections
- vector bundle fibers
- differentiable vector bundles and tensor bundles

**Improvements in the preexisting code**

- restriction of vectorframes depended on some strange order: fixed!
- ~~`SR` enforcement for automorphism field inversion removed (due to ticket #28189)~~
- `is_unit()` method superficially implemented for scalar fields to ensure division free matrix inversion for changes of frames (may be removed when #28629 is solved) 

**Planned in the farther future**

- sections of general tensor products and automorphism fields on vector bundles
- tensor products and Whitney sums of vector bundles
- better zero treatment as in #28562
- `TensorField` inherits from `Section`, `VectorFrame` inherits from `LocalFrame`
- total space comes with induced charts

Thanks for this endeavor. I gave a look: it looks very nice! Please go on.

A minor comment: for class names, full names are preferable, so `TopolVectorBundle` could be replaced by `TopologicalVectorBundle`. Also maybe, in the context of vector bundles, `TransitionMap` is more appropriate than `CoordChange`.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Also, it could be a good idea to generalize tensor fields and vector fields
to tensor product sections and treat tensor fields as a special case then.
But that's a huge step with pretty much effort (because I'm not that much
into your complete manifold code and the synergies between your files),
where I'd appreciate some help -- if you agree of course. 

My first approach in mind is to implement just simple sections and program tensor products of bundles aswell.

Sorry for the delay in replying. 
IMHO, you should introduce a subclass of `TopologicalVectorBundle` for the tangent bundle (or more generally for tensor bundles) and simply have the method `section` of this subclass return a vector field on the manifold, as defined by the "old" code. Maybe it is sufficient to have a single subclass for all tensor bundles, including the tangent and cotangent bundles, i.e. something like

```
class TensorBundle(TopologicalVectorBundle):

    def __init__(self, manifold, k, l):
        rank = manifold.dim()**(k+l)
        if (k, l) == (1, 0):
            name = "T{}".format(manifold._name)
        elif (k, l) == (0, 1):
            name = "T*{}".format(manifold._name)
        else:
            name = "T^({}{}){}".format(k, l, manifold._name)
        # similar code for latex_name
        TopologicalVectorBundle.__init__(self, rank, name, manifold, 
                                         field=manifold.base_field(),
                                         latex_name=latex_name)
        self._tensor_type = (k, l)

    def section(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.tensor_type == (1, 0):
            return self._base_space.vector_field(*args, **kwargs)
        return self._base_space.tensor_field(*(self._tensor_type + args), **kwargs)
```
In the code for differentiable manifolds, you could then add

```
class DifferentiableManifold(TopologicalManifold):

    ...

    def tangent_bundle(self):
        return TensorBundle(self, 1, 0)

    def cotangent_bundle(self):
        return TensorBundle(self, 0, 1)

    def tensor_bundle(self, k, l)
        return TensorBundle(self, k, l)

```

Sorry for the delay in replying. I gave a look and it looks very good! Please go on.

A few comments/questions:
- you've deleted the dependency to #28189 while some source files modified in this ticket (those in `src/sage/matrix` and `src/sage/sets`) pertain to #28189
- vector bundles have not been added to the reference manual yet; I guess you have to edit/add some files in `src/doc/en/reference/manifolds` and check that the documentation builds correcty with

```
sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html
```
- notice that the doctests that output a dictionary, like

```
sage: E.changes_of_frame()
```
  in line 105 of `trivialization.py`, must be marked `# random`
- there is a typo in line 38 of `trivialization.py`:

```
    `(p, v) \mapsto \pi^{-1}(p)` is a linear isomorphism.  
```
  must be replaced by something like

```
    `(p, v) \mapsto v` is a linear isomorphism from `\pi^{-1}(p)` to `K^n`.
```
- another typo, in line 8 of `vector_bundle.py`: 

```
- the set `E_p=\pi^{-1}(x)` has the vector space structure of `K^n`,
```
  `x` has to be replaced by `p`.
- the function `TopologicalVectorBundle.atlas()` returns a shallow copy of `self._atlas`; why does it not return directly `self._atlas` ?
- shouldn't the method `TopologicalVectorBundle.total_space()` be cached? (possibly using the decorator ``@`cached_method`)

\\
I just borrowed the same code lines from manifold.py. I guess, this is for convenience: One should not allow to alter the list when getting the atlas through this method.
\\\\

\\
For now, yes. But later on, when the computation of the atlas is implemented, one should update the manifold's atlas, maybe using this method.

For instance it depends on the computer. So a doctest that involves a directory output may fail on a different computer.

When printing a dictionary, the order of elements is random. For instance it depends on the computer. So a doctest that involves a directory output may fail on a different computer. The marker `# random` ensures that the doctest is skipped (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-doctests).

Ah yes, you are right: that's already there for manifolds.

Yes this could be the reason. Travis, do remember why such a choice was made? 
On the other side, things are not very consistent here, since `frames()` returns directly `self._frames` and we have the same for many other manifold methods.

OK, I see.

Probably all of them should return copies of the lists because it better protects the data. It is really easy to access stuff and then unintentionally change it, which could then throw your entire system out of balance.

My concern here would be about efficiency. We might have quite often loops like 

```
for chart in M.atlas():
    ...
```
This implies that a list is created each time such a loop occurs. But maybe the CPU cost is negligible...

There was an issue with the restrictions of (vector) frames. Namely, the list of sub- and superframes was not complete and depended on some strange random order. Here is an example:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V'); W = U.intersection(V, name='W')
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e')
sage: eV = e.restrict(V); eU = e.restrict(U); eW = e.restrict(W)
sage: eW._superframes
{Vector frame (W, (e_0,e_1)),
 Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1)),
 Vector frame (V, (e_0,e_1))}
sage: eU._subframes
{Vector frame (U, (e_0,e_1))}
sage: eV._subframes
{Vector frame (W, (e_0,e_1)), Vector frame (V, (e_0,e_1))}
```

I fixed it by avoiding any recursion and expanding the tree of subframes (and superframes) starting from the reference frame. Please check.

<a id='comment:57'></a>Docbuild errors are notoriously quite difficult. Unfortunately it usually just means going over the file carefully with some general hint from the error message about what you should be looking for. I can also go through it if you haven't been able to find what is going wrong.

As for authorship, I would say just listing yourself as the author because you did write the code, even if it is adapted from others. I don't think they should (or need to) have a copyright. Although it doesn't hurt to say it was based off another file, but I don't have a stake in this. Eric is best to comment on this.

Are there things you can put as methods in the category of vector bundles? At least I think there should be an abstract method for the base space, and maybe also the projection map (i.e., things in this category should have a common way to give the defining properties).

This code doesn't do anything:

```
        if update_atlas:
            # TODO: if self._atlas not empty, introduce charts
            pass
```

I would change `Moebius` to `Möbius` in the documentation (also make sure to add the utf8 encoding `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to the first line of such files).

```diff
-        desc = "Module "
-        desc += self._name + " "
-        desc += "of sections "
-        desc += "on the {} ".format(self._domain)
-        desc += "with values in the " + self._vbundle.base_field_type() + " "
-        desc += "vector bundle " + self._vbundle._name + " "
-        desc += "of rank {}".format(self._vbundle.rank())
+        desc = "Module {} of sections on the {} with values in the {} vector bundle of rank {}"
+        desc = desc.format(self._name, self._domain, self._vbundle.base_field_type(), self._vbundle.rank())
```

```diff
-Sets the default local frame on ``self``.
+Set the default local frame on ``self``.
```

I will probably have more changes, but I don't have time right now to look in full detail.

I think you can remove my name from the copyright, leaving just yours. 

I'll have a look at the code soon.

Here it is:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/section.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/manifolds/section.py", line 305, in sage.manifolds.section.Section._latex_
Failed example:
    omega = E.section(name='\omega')
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:warning
...
    DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \o
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   6 in sage.manifolds.section.Section._latex_
    [735 tests, 1 failure, 29.78 s]
```
This is because the raw string marker `r` is missing in front of `'\omega'`: the line 305 should read

```
   sage: omega = E.section(name=r'\omega')
```
Probably the reason why you don't get this error is that you are using Python 2 version of Sage, which is less strict in this respect (however, this is still an error, since the LaTeX output will not be correct). On general ground, I would advise you to use Python 3 version of Sage for development, since Sage 9.0 will be Python 3 based. Installing Python 3 Sage is pretty easy:

```
git clone https://github.com/sagemath/sage.git
cd sage
git checkout develop
git pull
make configure
./configure --with-python=3
MAKE="make -j8" make
```

<a id='comment:86'></a>Thank you so much for overlooking my code and your effort! There was still quite a lot to do.

There's just one thing in `differentiable/vector_bundle.py` around line 389 in the class `TensorBundle`:

"OUPUT" -> "OUTPUT"

Apart from that, I agree. :)

Corrected in the above commit.
I've also introduced minor changes to improve the documentation (I hope). 

I have also performed some changes in the code, replacing `self._dest_map` by `self._dest_map.restrict(domain)` in `DifferentiableVectorBundle.section()` and `DifferentiableVectorBundle.local_frame()`. Besides, I have made the latter return `NotImplementedError` when the tensor bundle is not the tangent bundle, because in such a case, a `VectorFrame` should not be returned. Do you agree? Shall we maintain the alias `vector_frame` for `local_frame`?

I have some question regarding the methods `atlas()`, `change_of_frame()`, `changes_of_frame`, `coframes()`, `frames()`, `set_change_of_frame()`,  `transition()`, `transitions()` of class `DifferentiableVectorBundle`: are these methods really necessary? As currently implemented, they return only features of the base manifold. In particular, none of them is using the tensor type `(k, l)` of `self`.

OK, I see.

>However, a corresponding remark in the documentation might be a good idea.


Yes, there should be a warning that the returned object is actually not a bundle local frame, although it canonically determines it, as you say. The same thing holds for the method `trivialization()`, which returns a chart on the base manifold and actually not a trivialization in the sense of a vector bundle.

OK.

Indeed.

Not at the moment.

I let you revert the `NotImplementedError` and add the relevent warnings.

Yes, I guess by "next step", you mean "in another ticket".

Done.

Would you take a short look for typos etc?

Also, I've changed the name of the base space in the documentation of `TensorBundle` to `N` instead of `U`.

Do you agree so far? Any more suggestions?

   ch_basis_inv = ch_basis.inverse()
```
So I strongly suspect the issue to be due to the change in the computation of inverse automorphism fields introduced in this ticket.

This is not entirely true. If the vector bundle is similarly complicated as the example in the notebook, it runs into the same problem.

However, forcing sage to use the inversion algorithm for fields would be very nice!
