In the folder `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron` there is an empty folder that keeps appearing.

This is because `bit_vector_operations` was not properly defined in `module_list.py`.

We fix this by including the functions needed directly in each file with `cdef extern from "bit_vector_operations.cc"` and removing the module `sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/bit_vector_operations.cc`.

Somehow, this ticket does more than changing 2-3 lines... Perhaps also change the title of the ticket. This will help in the future to traceback if necessary...
