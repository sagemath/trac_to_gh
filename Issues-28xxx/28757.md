In the folder `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron` there is an empty folder that keeps appearing.

This is because `bit_vector_operations` was not properly defined in `module_list.py`.

We fix this by including the functions needed directly in each file with `cdef extern from "bit_vector_operations.cc"` and removing the module `sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/bit_vector_operations.cc`.

This is a new approach. I remove the module `bit_vector_operations` completely. Instead each file just includes whatever it needs from `bit_vector_operations.cc`.

There are no new functions. It's just that we know grep them directly from the .cc file:

```diff
-from .bit_vector_operations cimport intersection, bit_rep_to_coatom_rep
