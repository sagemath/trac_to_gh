they come from the topcom's pexpect interface.

This removes TOPCOM from being the default engine for triangulations. While this fixes the issue, maybe there exist examples where using TOPCOM as default engine would be desirable?

No objections to changing the default engine as in the proposed patch.

For computing one triangulation, if I remember correctly, there's nothing special in TOPCOM; it just computes a regular triangulation via cddlib. Using normaliz for computing a triangulation is probably faster.

For listing all triangulations, TOPCOM is probably the best choice for nontrivial examples, but the interfacing should be improved.

by the way, the bot says

```

I updated the doc according to the new default behavior.

I need to catch a plane today and will be unavailable during the next week. I had no time now to fix the ker thing (I don't understand how this part of code can work as the `ker` is indeed not defined before being used). So I let you do the follow up if needed.

I think it's actually OK, as on the 1st run of the loop the condition where `ker` is used is never reached (as `edges == []` at this moment, so `if edges ...` stops at evaluating `edges` and does not see `ker`); and then `ker` is set, and all is kosher.
