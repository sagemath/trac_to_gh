as well, `make topcom-clean` must work; currently it does not remove the corresponding binaries, and after runnig it still

```
sage: P=PointConfiguration([(0,1/3),(0,1),(1/3,1)])
sage: P._have_TOPCOM()
True
```
and topcom is kept as the default engine...

No objections to changing the default engine as in the proposed patch.

For computing one triangulation, if I remember correctly, there's nothing special in TOPCOM; it just computes a regular triangulation via cddlib. Using normaliz for computing a triangulation is probably faster.

For listing all triangulations, TOPCOM is probably the best choice for nontrivial examples, but the interfacing should be improved.

I updated the doc according to the new default behavior.

I need to catch a plane today and will be unavailable during the next week. I had no time now to fix the ker thing (I don't understand how this part of code can work as the `ker` is indeed not defined before being used). So I let you do the follow up if needed.

I think it's actually OK, as on the 1st run of the loop the condition where `ker` is used is never reached (as `edges == []` at this moment, so `if edges ...` stops at evaluating `edges` and does not see `ker`); and then `ker` is set, and all is kosher.
