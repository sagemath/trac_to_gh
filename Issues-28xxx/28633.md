Currently, when copying a normaliz polyhedron, the `_normaliz_cone` is not copied appropriately:

```
sage: p = polytopes.hypercube(7,backend='normaliz')
sage: pcopy = copy(p)
sage: p == pcopy
True
sage: p is pcopy
False
sage: pcone = p._normaliz_cone
sage: pcopycone = pcopy._normaliz_cone
sage: pcone == pcopycone
True
sage: pcone is pcopycone
True
```

This ticket implements the `__copy__` method in the normaliz backend by making use of the method `NmzConeCopy` of `PyNormaliz`. This way, a copy of a polyhedron with backend Normaliz contains a true copy of the normaliz cone.
