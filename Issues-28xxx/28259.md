The profiling is impressive: 95% of the computation is spent by the vertex/edge management
- add_edge 19% (for ~250K calls)
- delete_vertex 50% (for ~5K calls)
- has_vertex 2.7% (for ~180K calls)
- iterator_in_edges 1.8% (for ~250K calls)
- iterator_out_edges 11% (for ~800K calls)

Of course, my computation use the graphs extensively. But still it does not only use that... The only thing I can do to make it faster is to either make Sage graphs better or get rid of them in my program. At this stage, I am not sure which direction to take. The sparse graph backend is a huge mess of code. Rewriting any part of it will take a considerable amount of time. I will probably write a custom graph class from scratch that fits my need.

#30769 might be a good step towards this goal.

With this ticket, I get the following timings:

- `igraph`: 10 ms
- dense `DiGraph`: 15 ms
- sparse `DiGraph`: 32 ms

Note that sparse graphs also carry a copy of the reversed graph, so the actual arc is added twice.

Profiling suggests that this business of `get_vertex_checked` should be improved, especially in case of integers. For dense graphs this seems to take up almost all the time. (I'm not sure how to proceed with this.)

This also implies that improving the data structure for sparse graphs could give us a large speedup here. (But I'm even less sure how to proceed with this.)

Ideally we should just be wrapping some pure C implementation but vertex labels and edge labels are delicate to deal with.\n\nAlso, we could introduce a new (simpler) datastructure similar to static sparse graphs but for which one can reallocate individually the arrays used for neighbor lists. This can be amortized in terms of graph creation and would benefit from all algorithms already implemented for static sparse graph. However, such data structure will be a bit costly for merging vertices.",

This is a pity. Maybe a flag `.has_integral_vertices` which implies that the graph has vertex set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`? When the flag is set, one could bypass translations.

I did try in the past to rewrite sparse graph (do not remember which ticket), but it ended up being painful. Ideally we should just be wrapping some pure C implementation but vertex labels and edge labels are delicate to deal with.

Also, we could introduce a new (simpler) datastructure similar to static sparse graphs but for which one can reallocate individually the arrays used for neighbor lists. This can be amortized in terms of graph creation and would benefit from all algorithms already implemented for static sparse graph. However, such data structure will be a bit costly for merging vertices.
