And, by the way, `gap` instead of `meataxe` appears to work, but is not documented.

Note that I've opened #28871 for a different meataxe issue (compiler warnings for the meataxe wrappers in the sage library). But I don't think there is a dependency in one direction or the other.

Here's the problem:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(5))
True
```
The non-default implementation "meataxe" would only be considered when `is_IntegerModRing(R)` returns False but `is_FiniteField(R)` returns True.

What do you think: Would it be a good idea to totally rewrite the logic that is implemented in `get_matrix_class`? It seems rather convoluted to me. The easiest fix would of course be to *first* check whether we have a finite field and only later check whether we at least have an `IntegerModRing`.

With the new commit, I switch the "if-then" branches for integer-mod-rings and for finite fields, which is needed since we want to treat finite prime fields as fields and not as integer-mod-rings.

Also, I added an example for `implementation='gap'`.

I didn't run tests yet, but switch it to "needs review" anyway...

I don't know what pyflakes complains about (it says "no such log"). Anyway, without meataxe tests pass. So, hopefully the remaining question is whether they also pass with meataxe installed.

The method `_matrices_from_rows` is defined in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`. So, perhaps Matrix_gfpn_dense should use the template?

Apparently not. Its first line states "Dense matrices over `\ZZ/n\ZZ` for `n` small using the LinBox library (FFLAS/FFPACK)."

Actually it could be that the creation of matrices from rows is defined for general matrices anyway. And as there is only a single line of code that actually uses `_matrices_from_rows`, it may very well be a better solution to nuke `_matrices_from_rows`.

I was mistaken about the purpose of `_matrices_from_rows`: It isn't about slicing but it is a very technical and hardly natural construction.

`src/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx` is the only place in which this method. It is supposed to be with a matrix over ZZ/nZZ, but meataxe is strictly over a field. Moreover, by default, meataxe should only be used in Sage when there is a finite NON-PRIME field. Hence, even over ZZ/(prime(ZZ), meataxe should normally not be used.
