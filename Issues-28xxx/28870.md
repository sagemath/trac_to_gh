And, by the way, `gap` instead of `meataxe` appears to work, but is not documented.

Note that I've opened #28871 for a different meataxe issue (compiler warnings for the meataxe wrappers in the sage library). But I don't think there is a dependency in one direction or the other.

After installing meataxe and `sage -b`, one has

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(25,'x'),5)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: M.parent().element_class
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
```

So, meataxe as default implementation does work.

Here's the problem:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(5))
True
```
The non-default implementation "meataxe" would only be considered when `is_IntegerModRing(R)` returns False but `is_FiniteField(R)` returns True.

What do you think: Would it be a good idea to totally rewrite the logic that is implemented in `get_matrix_class`? It seems rather convoluted to me. The easiest fix would of course be to *first* check whether we have a finite field and only later check whether we at least have an `IntegerModRing`.

With the new commit, I switch the "if-then" branches for integer-mod-rings and for finite fields, which is needed since we want to treat finite prime fields as fields and not as integer-mod-rings.

Also, I added an example for `implementation='gap'`.

I didn't run tests yet, but switch it to "needs review" anyway...

cc-ing Jeroen in case he has any comments about the change in `get_matrix_class` logic since (IIRC) he was the person who last rewrote that constructor.

The method `_matrices_from_rows` is defined in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`. So, perhaps Matrix_gfpn_dense should use the template?

Apparently not. Its first line states "Dense matrices over `\ZZ/n\ZZ` for `n` small using the LinBox library (FFLAS/FFPACK)."

Actually it could be that the creation of matrices from rows is defined for general matrices anyway. And as there is only a single line of code that actually uses `_matrices_from_rows`, it may very well be a better solution to nuke `_matrices_from_rows`.
