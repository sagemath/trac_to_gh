And, by the way, `gap` instead of `meataxe` appears to work, but is not documented.

Note that I've opened #28871 for a different meataxe issue (compiler warnings for the meataxe wrappers in the sage library). But I don't think there is a dependency in one direction or the other.

After installing meataxe and `sage -b`, one has

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(25,'x'),5)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: M.parent().element_class
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
```

So, meataxe as default implementation does work.

Here's the problem:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(5))
True
```
The non-default implementation "meataxe" would only be considered when `is_IntegerModRing(R)` returns False but `is_FiniteField(R)` returns True.

What do you think: Would it be a good idea to totally rewrite the logic that is implemented in `get_matrix_class`? It seems rather convoluted to me. The easiest fix would of course be to *first* check whether we have a finite field and only later check whether we at least have an `IntegerModRing`.

The easiest fix would of course be to *first* check whether we have a finite field and only later check whether we at least have an `IntegerModRing`.

With the new commit, I switch the "if-then" branches for integer-mod-rings and for finite fields, which is needed since we want to treat finite prime fields as fields and not as integer-mod-rings.

Also, I added an example for `implementation='gap'`.

I didn't run tests yet, but switch it to "needs review" anyway...

cc-ing Jeroen in case he has any comments about the change in `get_matrix_class` logic since (IIRC) he was the person who last rewrote that constructor.

Interesting. According to "git blame", that method was introduced by Burcin Erocal 10 years ago. Why has that error never shown up before?

The method `_matrices_from_rows` is defined in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`. So, perhaps Matrix_gfpn_dense should use the template?

Apparently not. Its first line states "Dense matrices over `\ZZ/n\ZZ` for `n` small using the LinBox library (FFLAS/FFPACK)."

Actually it could be that the creation of matrices from rows is defined for general matrices anyway. And as there is only a single line of code that actually uses `_matrices_from_rows`, it may very well be a better solution to nuke `_matrices_from_rows`.
