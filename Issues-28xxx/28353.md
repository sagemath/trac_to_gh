As reported on [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47470/var-list-with-only-one-variable-error/):

```
sage: var(['x'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

I believe the most consistent behavior would be to still treat this similarly to a list of "multiple" names, and return a 1-tuple.
