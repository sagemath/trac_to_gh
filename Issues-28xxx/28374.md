```markdown
The documentation is stored as a GitLab artifact (700MB per build.) We might get into trouble eventually for storing so much data on GitLab but I did not see any explicit limits there.

See https://sagemath.gitlab.io/-/dev/sage/-/jobs/276493066/artifacts/html/en/index.html for the documentation generated by this branch.
