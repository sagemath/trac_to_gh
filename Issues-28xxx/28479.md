The intention of `any_root` was to provide a faster method of getting a root when you don't need them all.  Unfortunately, the current implementation isn't faster than just factoring (at least in some cases).

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^120)
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: f = R.irreducible_element(60)
sage: %time z = f.any_root()
CPU times: user 22.6 s, sys: 115 ms, total: 22.7 s
Wall time: 22.8 s
sage: %time w = f.roots()[0]
CPU times: user 514 ms, sys: 16.3 ms, total: 531 ms
Wall time: 526 ms
```
We should test to see where the implementation of `any_root` should be improved or just switched to `f.roots()[0]`.
