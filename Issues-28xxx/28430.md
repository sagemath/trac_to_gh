This is a follow up of #27926. `barycentric_subdivision` was forgotten there.

Currently we have

```
sage: polytopes.simplex(backend='field').barycentric_subdivision().backend()
'ppl'
```

The backend should not be changed with this construction, so the desired output in this case is `'field'`.

At the moment that I wrote the lines, I was thinking about a potential improvement of the method, but it turns out it is a bit more involved, so I'd say yes, it is a positive review.
