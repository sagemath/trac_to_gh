I haven't seen problems with this much if at all until just recently trying to build Sage 8.8 from scratch for the Windows release.

Occasionally the build will just block on some package "Waiting for rebase lock".  It's not exactly clear why it's deadlocking.

Experimenting now with this branch.  Just trying to cut down the amount of time each `sage-spkg` goes without holding the lock.  Not sure if it's really relevant though.
