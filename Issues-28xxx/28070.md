The function is_conjugate failed for degree 1 maps. Implemented a fix that reduced the problem to testing conjugacy via similar matrices (over PGL2).

Adjusted the documentation to make it clear over which ring conjugacy is being tested. 

Added a parameter to enable choice of ring over which conjugacy is being tested. 

Added early exit based on sigma invariants for dimension 1 if testing conjugacy over a number field or a finite field. 

Keywords: SI2019

<a id='comment:8'></a>``R'' needs to be added to the INPUT section of the docs

Also you should use the keyword as a keyword, i.e. 

```
f.is_conjugate(g, R=QQbar)
```

Finally, the new TEST seems like a good one as an EXAMPLE and it helps the user see the difference. It also needs to be marked

```
# long time

<a id='comment:16'></a>Two small typos in conjugating_set documentation:
"Determine to see if" (remove "to see")
"by by" (second "by" hard to spot as it's on a new line)

Bigger issue, the following fails:

```python
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(GF(5), 1)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([7*x + 12*y, 8*x])
g = DynamicalSystem_projective([5*x - 8*y, 3*x - 8*y])
m = f.conjugating_set(g)[0]
f.conjugate(m) == g
```

returns false but

```python
f.conjugate(matrix(GF(5),2,2,[1,0,1,1]).inverse())==g
```

returns true. 

The problem seems to be in the field of definition of m is the algebraic closure of GF(5) which then changes the of f.conjugate(m) to also be the algebraic closure.
