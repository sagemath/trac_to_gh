The pattern `sdh_XYZ || sdh_die ...` one sees in few places is not necessary, and `sdh_XYZ` alone suffices, isn't it?

By looking at the code of e.g. `sdh_configure`
one sees that `sdh_die` is actually called in `sdh_configure`, and so chaining them
as above is pointless (the part after `||` won't be called).

This should be mentioned in the docs.

By the way, there was already a ticket for this task at #24023.

Something I wanted to do for that was to have a way to automatically include the in-line docs in `sage-dist-helpers` into the Sphinx docs, but I would have needed to write a plugin, and didn't get to do it.

Oops, sorry.

Maybe we can leave #24023 open for that.

No problem.  Personally I sometimes even prefer opening separate tickets for specific solutions to a problem from the ticket for the problem itself.

specifically about JSON files, de-installation is handled by `build/sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py`, and there are good docs there, but I don't know where these JSON files are written.

I have a vague recollection I knew it once, but it's not clear to me now, without digging through the whole command chain and makefiles... :-(
