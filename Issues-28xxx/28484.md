The dependency on #28482 is purely for some doctests, but it can be factored out by using a different matroid.

The word "over" here should be removed.

Are "NBC sets" defined somewhere? I'm asking because I keep forgetting (and I am not sure whether there is a standard) whether a broken circuit is a circuit without its largest edge or a circuit without its smallest edge.

Also, huge kudos for implementing this!

I agree. I will change this shortly along with fixing the pyflakes warnings Frédéric pointed out.

> Are "NBC sets" defined somewhere? I'm asking because I keep forgetting (and I am not sure whether there is a standard) whether a broken circuit is a circuit without its largest edge or a circuit without its smallest edge.


This is defined in the matroid class and is the smallest edge in a circuit.

Thanks. It actually was not too hard as I could use the Orlik-Solomon as a base. At some point, it probably would be good to implement the more general `\chi` algebras, but I don't have a use for them now. `^^;;`
