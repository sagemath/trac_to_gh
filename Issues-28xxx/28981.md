In Sage 9.3.rc0:

```
sage: PP.<x, y, z, a, b, c> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ, [2, 2])
sage: X = PP.subscheme([x*a, x*b, x*c, y*a, y*b, y*c, z*a, z*b])
sage: X.dimension()  # expected: 0
1
sage: X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension()  # correct
0
```

The answer returned by `X.segre_embedding().codomain().dimension()`
is correct, as this subscheme is supported on a single point.

The answer returned by `X.dimension()` is incorrect.

**Keywords:** subscheme
