When `python` runs Python 3, the IPython `spkg-install` script creates a symlink `ipython3 -> ipython` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, and this interferes with the installation process.

unistall only happens if it was properly installed (with sdh_... script), with the corresponding uninstall info stored.
If not, it would be left there.

IMHO "rf -f blah" ignores the result  - if blah was not there, there is still no error (although OSX might be different...)
