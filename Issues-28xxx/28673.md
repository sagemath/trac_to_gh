When `python` runs Python 3, the IPython `spkg-install` script creates a symlink `ipython3 -> ipython` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, and this interferes with the installation process.

By the way, the deleted lines never really functioned as intended: in earlier versions of Sage, `python` was always installed as Python 2. In the most recent versions of Sage, with a Python 3 build, `python2` is not installed, so there is no `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python`. In that case the test

```
if python -c 'import sys; sys.exit(sys.version_info.major != 3)'
```
will only test positively if the system `python` runs Python 3.

Also, the `spkg-install` procedure involves building elsewhere and then installing all at once into `SAGE_LOCAL`, so manually creating the symlink makes no sense at all.

unistall only happens if it was properly installed (with sdh_... script), with the corresponding uninstall info stored.
If not, it would be left there.

IMHO "rf -f blah" ignores the result  - if blah was not there, there is still no error (although OSX might be different...)
