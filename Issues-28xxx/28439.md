The function `Interface.interact()` gives interactive access to the interpreter session of a pexpect interface that is running in the background. This ticket fixes the following issues with the output:

- whitespace is incorrectly stripped from the front of the output string
- special characters are not properly escaped
- the syntax `sage(...)` for evaluating expressions in Sage does not support nested parentheses

---

The whitespace issues are particularly frequent with interfaces that use ASCII art for printing like Mathematica and Macaulay2:

```
sage: macaulay2.interact()

  --> Switching to Macaulay2 <--

macaulay2: M = ZZ^2
2
ZZ

ZZ-module, free
```

An artificial example using a standard interface which shows whitespace and escaping issue:

```
sage: gap.interact()

  --> Switching to Gap <--

gap: Print("  \\\\")
\
```

With the usual `gap.eval()` the escaping is done correctly, but in the case of Gap, whitespace is still stripped from the front.

```
sage: gap.eval(r'Print("  \\\\")')
\\
```

I changed the Gap interface to preserve whitespace at the front in order to be able to add a doctest for `interact` using a standard interface.

As for the nested parentheses,  the following example now works. The expressions `sage(...)` are evaluated in Sage and the results are converted to Gap. Previously, this only worked for very simple expressions not containing any parenthesis.

```
sage: %gap

  --> Switching to Gap <--

gap: 2 + sage((1+2)*gap(-(5-3)^2).sage()) - sage(1+(2-1))
-12
```

I suggest testing this in the terminal, as in the Jupyter notebook there does not seem to be a way to exit the subshells.

The remaining pyflakes warning is a false positive.
