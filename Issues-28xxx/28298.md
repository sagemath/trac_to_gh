After #26212, there remains only a few failing doctests (not using any optional package).

Fixed:

- 1 in src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphtheory_doctest.py #28300
- 1 in src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/sol/graphtheory_doctest.py #28300
- (A) 1 in src/sage/combinat/root_system/non_symmetric_macdonald_polynomials.py #28305
- (D) 1 in src/sage/tests/cmdline.py #28320
- (C) 1 in src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx #28219 #28412
- (K) 2 in src/sage/crypto/block_cipher/present.py #28403
- (B) 7 in src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py #27967 #28351
- (E) 1 at line 597 in src/sage/libs/eclib/interface.py #28454 #28472
- (G) src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx #28334 #28649
- (H) 1 in src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx #28622
- (I) 2 in src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx #28622
- (J) 4 in src/sage/repl/attach.py #28622

Those that are not yet handled are the following.

*On several machines*:

- (F) 1 in src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_finite_field.py (not seen since some time. random ? could be ignored ?)

but not on these machines: macOS mojave (several different machines)

OS X only:

- (K) 2 in src/sage/symbolic/expression.py #28489
- (L) 1 in src/sage/numerical/linear_tensor_element.pyx #28559

The flint one is strange, since flint doesn't depend on Python. So either the error occurs also in Python 2, or there is something strange going on with the flint interface.

Maybe this is a stupid question, but are we sure that the errors that are unique to the patchbot are machine-specific (i.e. reproducible on that machine) or is there a chance this could be fixed by doing a clean install?

I have just "make distclean" that precise patchbot machine. It is currently running, and we will see the results in 2 hours. This machine has a fairly stable configuration, and the remaining failing doctests have been there since many releases.

Some of these errors pass when each file is doctested alone. Some look like a mis-synchronized (pexpect ?) interface.

Of course, we will have to make the decision when we claim "all doctests pass", in spite of the remaining quantum noise..

At this point, it begins to be useful to widen the scope of our checks. I proceeded to ` make ptestalllong` on two different machines (but very close), with a few optional packages, both running 8.9.beta9.

//Please let me know if this isn't the right place to post this kind of reports...//

TL;DR:
* ` make ptestalllong` gives failures on 22 packages total (20 on one machine, 19 on the other);
* Most of these failure cannot be reproduced when running the test standalone (whether `MAKE` is defined or not). Three file persist to fail when ran standalone:
    - src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py (known)
    - src/sage/libs/eclib/interface.py (also known)
    - src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py (not known but optional package, fails only on one of my machines).

I have no explanation for the intermachines differences; one is a Debian testing desktop (core i7, 8 GB RAM), the other is a Debian testing laptop (core i7, 16 GB RAM).

The large number of transient failures let me think that some parts of the libraries are not as reentrant as we might wish them to be...

Details of failing files:
