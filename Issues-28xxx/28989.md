The proper cycle of the indefinite quadratic form x<sup>2</sup>+xy-y<sup>2</sup> consists of x<sup>2</sup>+xy-y<sup>2</sup> and -x<sup>2</sup>+xy+y<sup>2</sup>. Sage gives only one element.

```
sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
sage: Q.cycle(proper=True) 
[x^2 + x*y - y^2]
```

As a consequence, consider two quadratic forms of discriminant 5. Two such forms are always properly equivalent. However, we get

```
sage: Q1, Q2 = BinaryQF(1,1,-1), BinaryQF(-1,1,1) 
sage: Q1.is_equivalent(Q2, proper=True) 
False
```

To check proper equivalence, note that

```
sage: M=Matrix(ZZ,2,2, [1,1,-1,0])
sage: det(M)
1
sage: Q2 == Q1.matrix_action_right(M)
True
```




Keywords: binary quadratic forms

<a id='comment:2'></a>Thanks for reporting the bug. My patch fixes an error in the definition of the `cycle` function.

```
sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
sage: Q.cycle(proper=True)
[x^2 + x*y - y^2, -x^2 + x*y + y^2]
sage: Q1, Q2 = BinaryQF(1,1,-1), BinaryQF(-1,1,1) 
sage: Q1.is_equivalent(Q2, proper=True)
True
```

I am not setting this to "needs review" yet, for two reasons: the doctests need work, and I am not sure this gives correct answers for quadratic forms whose first coefficient is negative. (The reference [BV2007] seems to require the first coefficient to be positive.) I think I should be able to get this figured out, but it's great if someone who knows about quadratic forms wants to chime in.
