The proper cycle of the indefinite quadratic form x<sup>2</sup>+xy-y<sup>2</sup> consists of x<sup>2</sup>+xy-y<sup>2</sup> and -x<sup>2</sup>+xy+y<sup>2</sup>. Sage gives only one element.

```
sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
sage: Q.cycle(proper=True) 
[x^2 + x*y - y^2]
```

As a consequence, consider two quadratic forms of discriminant 5. Two such forms are always properly equivalent. However, we get

```
sage: Q1, Q2 = BinaryQF(1,1,-1), BinaryQF(-1,1,1) 
sage: Q1.is_equivalent(Q2, proper=True) 
False
```

To check proper equivalence, note that

```
sage: M=Matrix(ZZ,2,2, [1,1,-1,0])
sage: det(M)
1
sage: Q2 == Q1.matrix_action_right(M)
True
```

Thanks for reporting the bug. My patch fixes an error in the definition of the `cycle` function.

```
sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
sage: Q.cycle(proper=True)
[x^2 + x*y - y^2, -x^2 + x*y + y^2]
sage: Q1, Q2 = BinaryQF(1,1,-1), BinaryQF(-1,1,1) 
sage: Q1.is_equivalent(Q2, proper=True)
True
```

I am not setting this to "needs review" yet, for two reasons: the doctests need work, and I am not sure this gives correct answers for quadratic forms whose first coefficient is negative. (The reference [BV2007] seems to require the first coefficient to be positive.) I think I should be able to get this figured out, but it's great if someone who knows about quadratic forms wants to chime in.

I fixed an additional mistake in the definition of `cycle`. (The statement of Proposition 6.10.5 of [BV2007] is ambiguous, and the original algorithm interpreted it incorrectly.) I validated the new algorithm on a couple of examples from [BV2007], and will add these as doctests. 

However, I also still need to look at quadratic forms whose coefficient of `x^2` is negative.

A few minor things:

```diff
-        TESTS::
+        TESTS:
 
         Check an example in :trac:`28989`::
+
-            sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
+            sage: Q = BinaryQF(1,1,-1)
             sage: Q.cycle(proper=True)
             [x^2 + x*y - y^2, -x^2 + x*y + y^2]
 
         This is Example 6.10.6 of [BUVO2007]_::
+
-            sage: Q=BinaryQF(1,7,-6)
+            sage: Q = BinaryQF(1,7,-6)
```
and any other similar changes.

```diff
-        Try an example where a is negative::
-            sage: Q=BinaryQF(-1, 8, 3)
+        Try an example where `a` is negative::
+
+            sage: Q = BinaryQF(-1, 8, 3)
```
The for-loop part is over-indented here:

```
            for i in range(len(C)//2):
                    C[2*i+1] = C[2*i+1]._Tau()
```

```diff
-                C = C + C
+                C += C
```
I also don't understand the point of this test:

```
            sage: hasattr(Q, '_cycle_list')
            False
```

Thanks for looking at the ticket, and for your corrections. I made all of the changes that you suggested, and searched to correct similar mistakes. I also noticed that the spacing in lists was inconsistent, so I standardized by always putting a space after commas.

You were right to question the `hasattr` test, because it does not really make sense as a doctest. So I deleted it, and also the similar test a few lines later.

Thank you. However, all of these changes except for the one I pointed out are wrong:

```diff
-TESTS::
+TESTS:
```
When there are two colons `::`, what should follow is indented and doctests. If there is only one colon `:`, then it should be normal text.
