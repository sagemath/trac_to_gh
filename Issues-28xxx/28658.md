This ticket changes the download as PNG feature to show a menu with that option and a couple others. This will allow access to whatever additional functions are suggested by users in the future.

The circled i is not rendered in the documentation output; one gets the raw html unicode instead:


"Clicking on the information icon &#x24D8; in the lower right-hand corner..."

Maybe a solution is to use the `:role:` directive, as indicated in the third answer to this 
[question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1862472/symbols-in-restructuredtext).

This is really fantastic! It works in the jupyter notebook and the command line. The two saving functions also work.

From what I can read about the camera info, it seems to encode it by a 4x4 matrix.
I am wondering if it would be good to either give a reference to interpret the output or explain the relevant information there? What do you think?

I would start looking this up online, as I am interested to know how threejs works internally.

Thanks for the new version. It fixes the html documentation but not the pdf one: running

```
sage -docbuild reference/plot3d pdf
```
results in

```
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char ‚ìò (U+24D8)

```
It could be that the solution of this is outside the scope of this ticket (unicode configuration of Sage's LaTeX...). Then, a quick fix should be to replace  "information icon |info|" by "information icon (circled i)" in the rst file.

I simply removed the unicode. An information icon is universally understood in the age of mobile phones.

I was planning to do this just before the release of version 9 to get all the accumulated changes. If you prefer I can do an update now, either on this ticket or a new one.

This action is meant to be temporary until I understand better how you'll use the information in the future. I was planning to have this action show only what you will actually use, then add an option to the Three.js template to pass that information into the scene. Since it will change in the near future, I won't add any documentation about it until things are settled.

Created new [ticket](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28672) for the enhancement.

Yes, [the plan in this comment15](#comment%3A15) sounds good. I had a try yesterday with this code and I can directly use the 4x4 matrix in order to reproduce the same output: Great! It seems like I don't need the full matrix but just the first 3x3 top submatrix, but I'd like to keep as it is now, so that we can understand a bit more as paulmasson suggested.

So yes, it looks good to go, I agree to the positive review.
