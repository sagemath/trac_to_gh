I will try to write a PR by tomorrow. I propose to revert `julia_plot` to its original interface (with a deprecation notice), and introduce an experimental function `julia_set_plot` with the new interface.

I have rated this as a major issue, but I am a newbie, and the function is not a core piece of sage, so I will not be surprised if someone downrates it (or tells me that I am out to lunch).

I agree that ideally the changes to `julia_plot` should have been backwards compatible or properly deprecated. It might be too late to get this into 9.0, though, since we are already on 9.0.rc1, which is unfortunate.
