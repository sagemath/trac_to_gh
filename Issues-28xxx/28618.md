The coercion model predicts that the division of a polynomial over `Qp` by an integer should lies in the fraction field

```
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.bin_op(Qp(7)['x'].one(), ZZ.one(), operator.truediv).parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x ...
```
However, the prediction is wrong

```
sage: parent(Qp(7)['x'].one() / ZZ.one())
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```

Note that the prediction of the coercion model is correct over rationals

```
sage: cm.bin_op(QQ['x'].one(), ZZ.one(), operator.truediv).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x ...
```

Looking at the coercion code, one possible reason is that there is no action by `ZZ` found by the coercion model

```
sage: cm.get_action(QQ['x'], ZZ, operator.mul)
Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on
  Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: cm.get_action(Zmod(135)['x']['y'], ZZ, operator.mul)
Right scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on
  Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over
  Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over
  Ring of integers modulo 135
sage: cm.get_action(Qp(7)['x'], ZZ, operator.mul)  # nothing!
```

This causes trouble for some code factorization in #28592.

The original trouble in #28592 probably qualifies as a bug. I'm not entirely sure that what is observed here is: at the face of it, we don't need an action because there's a common parent. Also, as reported on #28592, the would be

```
sage: cm.bin_op(Qp(7)['x'].one(), ZZ.one(), operator.truediv).parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```
however, this is at odds with actually executing the operation:

```
sage: parent(Qp(7)['x'].one() / ZZ.one())
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over 7-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```
In any case, should it turn out that the right way of getting this fixed is indeed by introducing actions, we should probably also consider

```
cm.bin_op(Qp(7)['x'].one(), Zp(7).one(), operator.truediv).parent()
```
Given that actions can't really be discovered transitively through the coercion graph, you'd end up having to add a LOT of actions, because there are so many copies of p-adic rings possible (with different precisions). That would have to be done programmatically (which is possible) and you would need to be careful about not introducing memory leaks.
