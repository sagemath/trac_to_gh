At [Sage Days 102](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days102) some students created some interacts that we would like to add to the Sage documentation in the appropriate places (either as additional examples in the [interact tutorial](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.html), or alternatively in the [interact reference docs](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/interact.html), or possibly elsewhere if someone has an idea for appropriate placement.

Originally the plan was to help those students open new tickets to propose their solutions as new additions to the docs, but unfortunately we did not have time to get them fully on-board with that.

However, I would like to work on getting that done in this ticket, and involve them in the process.  I'm just working on getting their original examples from them.  We can certainly make small tweaks (i.e. to clean up the formatting a bit) before including the examples.

It would also be nice if this went along with #28246, though neither of these tickets are directly dependent on each other.
