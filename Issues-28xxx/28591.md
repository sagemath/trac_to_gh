This ticket implements conversion of chain complexes from Macaulay2 to Sage, for example:

```
            sage: R = ZZ['a,b,c']
            sage: C = macaulay2(ideal(R.gens())).resolution()
            sage: unicode_art(C.sage())
                                   ⎛-b  0 -c⎞     ⎛ c⎞
                                   ⎜ a -c  0⎟     ⎜ a⎟
                       (a b c)     ⎝ 0  b  a⎠     ⎝-b⎠
             0 ⟵── C_0 ⟵────── C_1 ⟵───────── C_2 ⟵─── C_3 ⟵── 0
```

This ticket also fixes an issue where matrices of size 0×n failed to convert correctly.
