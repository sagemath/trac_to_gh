There is an error in the code for `is_inscribed`, where one assume that any `d` neighbors of a vertex necessarily span the space. This is wrong.

The following (most likely not minimal example) reproduces this:

The matrix `a` has zero determinant and causes this error. One should pick the neighbors more carefully to fix this.

Just because I was testing it, this is what I believe the smallest example where the current implementation of the method `is_inscribed()` fails. This is a pyramid over a pyramid over a square (with a specific ordering of the vertices)

<a id='comment:5'></a>Salut,

Looks good to me! I also like the second example, which is simpler. I was thinking about trying to reproduce the error with a smaller one, but then it all depends on the internal order given to vertices... But it is good in any case to have that one too.

I set this to positive review. Error fixed!

Merci pour la réparation rapide!
