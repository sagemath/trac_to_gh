This gives access to the Macaulay2 interpreter in the `_macaulay2_init_()` function, so it can also return `Macaulay2Elements` rather than just strings. The `_macaulay2_init_()` function is used for initializing Macaulay2 elements and is usually called by `_macaulay2_()` which then takes care of caching.

The magma interface also does this, but it had not been correctly set up until now.

Depends on #28074
