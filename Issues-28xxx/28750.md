```
var('s,x,y')
q = sqrt(2)
g = (x - y) * sin((x - y) / s)
g1 = integral(g({s:q}), y)
g2 = integral(g({s:q}), y, algorithm='sympy')
g3 = integral(g, y).subs({s:q})
```
Then g2 and g3 have the correct derivative, but not g1. 

possibly related to #30378 and #31530

This should be reported upstream to maxima. Karl-Dieter, would you please do that ?

For info, the correct answer as given by sympy is

```
sqrt(2)*(x - y)*cos(-1/2*sqrt(2)*(x - y)) + 2*sin(-1/2*sqrt(2)*(x - y))
```
