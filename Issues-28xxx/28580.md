`variable_names_recursive` is suppose to return the list of variable names of a polynomial ring and its base rings, as if it were a single multi-variate polynomial ring.

It works if the base ring is a polynomial ring:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(5), "x,y")
sage: PolynomialRing(R, 'q, t').variable_names_recursive()
('x', 'y', 'q', 't')
```
but not if the base ring is a quotient of a polynomial ring:

```
sage: x, y = R.gens()
sage: Q = R.quotient([x^2 - y^3])
sage: PolynomialRing(Q, 'q,t').variable_names_recursive() # should be ('xbar', 'ybar', 'q', 't')
('q', 't')
```
