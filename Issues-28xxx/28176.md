As pointed out by the people at #26771, `ClusterAlgebra` has few bugs.

- Default arguments do not play nicely with `UniqueRepresentation`
  

  ```
    sage: A1 = ClusterAlgebra(['A',2])
    sage: A2 = ClusterAlgebra(['A',2], cluster_variable_prefix='x')
    sage: A1 is A2
    False
  ```

- `mutate_initial` keeps the same variable names; In theory this is not a
  problem but may create confusion. For example suppose we are looking at the
  Grassmannian of planes in a 4 dimensional vector space. Then the associate
  cluster algebra is

  ```
    sage: A = ClusterAlgebra( matrix(5,[0,1,-1,1,-1]), cluster_variable_names=['p13'], coefficient_names=['p12','p23','p34','p41'], scalars=QQbar); A
    A Cluster Algebra with cluster variable p13 and coefficients p12, p23, p34, p41 over Algebraic Field
  ```

  Swapping out `p13` from the initial seed should give `p24` or, at the very
  least *not* `p13`. Getting `p24` requires some understanding of what the ring
  in question really is that goes beyond the scope of this class. Currently we
  get

  ```
    sage: A.mutate_initial(0)
    A Cluster Algebra with cluster variable p13 and coefficients p12, p23, p34, p41 over Algebraic Field
  ```

- `mutate_initial` does not compute all the required F-polynomials and it does not enforce the fact that they are not rational expressions

  ```
    sage: A1 = ClusterAlgebra(['A',[2,1],1])
    sage: A2 = A1.mutate_initial([0,1,0])
    sage: len(A2.g_vectors_so_far()) == len(A2.F_polynomials_so_far())
    False
    sage: all(parent(f) == A2._U for f in A2.F_polynomials_so_far())
    False
  ```

- finally `mutate_initial` does not enforce the fact that initial g-vectors
  belong to the initial cluster but rather prepend the performed  mutation sequence
  to all the paths already known. 

  ```
    sage: A2.find_g_vector((0,0,1))
    [0, 1, 0]
  ```

  This, while technically not false, may generate confusion.

- `_mutated_F` is doing `/` rather than `//` resulting in slower computations
  and parent issues.

This ticket deals with all these issues.

Oops. Fixed, sorry Frédéric!

With the occasion I also got some dramatic speedup in `mutate_initial` by not
mutating F-polynomials a quadratic number of times.

Also I changed a division into a polynomial division in `_mutated_F`; this
enforces F-polynomials to live in the correct ambient and yields a decent
speedup in `mutate`.
