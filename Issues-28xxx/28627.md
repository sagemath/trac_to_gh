I tried to cut the changes into meaningful commits, however the block

```

+
+        sage: s = oeis._imaginary_sequence(ident='A004238')
+        sage: s
+        A004238: The characteristic sequence of 42 plus one, starting from 38.
+        sage: s.online_update()                         # optional -- internet
+        sage: s                                         # optional -- internet
+        A004238: a(n) = 100*log(n) rounded to nearest integer.
```

should appear in the second commit, not the first, since at this stage `ident` parameter is not defined for imaginary sequences.

You should test the whole branch, the commits are made to ease human review.
