Since `SageNB` is now an optional package, we should detect whether it's present before doctesting its files via `make ptestlong` and similar commands.

Without these changes, a Python 2 build of Sage fails to run doctests. With these changes, tests pass for me with a plain Python 2 build and also after running `./sage -i sagenb`. Before running `./sage -i sagenb`, `make ptestlong` says

```
Doctesting 3796 files using 12 threads...
```
(Same with Python 2 or Python 3)

After running `./sage -i sagenb`, with Python 2:

```
Doctesting 3849 files using 12 threads...
```
So it appears that the extra files are being correctly detected and doctested.
