Hi Vincent,

Thank you for your comments.

I agree that the documentation is not great. The idea was just to factor out the idiom `RR(2).has_coerce_map_from(P)` that is used in a number of places, and to cache the result. (I also think that a way to test if a ring is a subring of the reals would be a good think to have, but that's not the point of this ticket.)

I'm happy with improving the documentation again if you have a better wording to suggest. However, I would prefer not to make changes that require rebasing #28517 without a really compelling reason at this point, because I'm starting to lack on time for all that, and #28517 is frankly a lot more important. If we want to rename the new functions or something like that, I think it will be easier to do it once #28517 has been reviewd.

Salut Marc,

I definitely agree that factorizing the various "is my ring a subring of real numbers" into a method is good idea. But since this ticket is fixing naming conventions, they should be thought carefully.

Though as nothing is pulled in the global Sage namespace and we can fix names later on.

- In `parent_is_numerical` docstring:
  - `this parent or type` -> <code>the parent or type \`\`P\`\`</code>
  - `typecan` -> `type can`

For efficiency reason, we might want to special case standard Python types in `parent_is_numerical` and `parent_is_real_numerical` rather than relying on `py_scalar_parent`.

It would be good to also tests non standard Python types such as `gmpy2.mpz`, `gmpy2.mpq`, `gmpy2.mpfr`, `gmpy2.mpc`.

Done, thanks.

I think that's premature. `py_scalar_parent` is quite fast, and non-Sage objects aren't used that much in time-critical code.

> It would be good to also tests non standard Python types such as `gmpy2.mpz`, `gmpy2.mpq`, `gmpy2.mpfr`, `gmpy2.mpc`.

Done.
