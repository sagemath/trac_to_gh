Flow polytopes of directed graphs are the convex hulls of nonnegative flow values for the arcs of said digraph such that the flow is conserved on internal vertices, and there is a unit of flow leaving the sources and entering the sinks.

Yet, while working with multi-digraphs where there are multiple arcs in the same (!) direction for some vertex pairs, the nonnegativity conditions may be violated and the flow polytope will not be a subset of the 0/1-cube any more.

A possible suggested temporary fix could be to intersect the resulting polytope with the needed halfspaces given by the nonnegativity constraints and the upper bounds of 1 for every variable, although that would not fix the underlying problem.

This already happens in the following small example: 

```python
sage: G = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,1)
sage: G.add_edge(0,1)
sage: G
Multi-digraph on 2 vertices
sage: P = G.flow_polytope()
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 1),)
sage: P.lines()
(A line in the direction (1, -1),)
```

P should be the polytope with vertices (0,1) and (1,0), without any lines.

Method `flow_polytope` builds a set of inequalities and a set of equalities and then gives them to `Polyhedron`.
Here we get

```
ineqs = [[0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]]
eqs = [[1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, 1]]
```
so 2 inequalities are the same. I suspect that `Polyhedron` simplifies that, but I'm not sure.

Ah, so the building of inequalities is wrong, as they should be the nonnegativity constraints for every arc (exactly one entry should be 1, the others should be 0). 

To generate the nonnegativity constraints we do

``` 
ineqs = [[0] + [Integer(j == u) for j in edges]
                 for u in edges] 
```
where instead it should be 

``` 
ineqs = [[0] + [Integer(j is u) for j in edges]
                 for u in edges] 
```
to account for the variables referencing the same object instead of just being equal, which breaks exactly in the case of multiple arcs having the same head, tail and label, or in other words, when dealing with Multi-Digraphs.

Maybe this happens in other functions too, where Multi-Digraphs have not been taken into account.

Either I get around to push this fix after reading how to do it on the homepage, but feel free to do it before me, I would be very thankful!

We cannot use `j is u` as

```
sage: edges = [(0, 1), (0, 1)]
sage: [[Integer(j is u) for j in edges] for u in edges]
[[1, 1], [1, 1]]
```
but we have a simpler and more efficient solution, as we only need a diagonal of 1's.

Is the following behavior we get with this patch also ok ?

```
sage: G = DiGraph([(0, 1, None)], multiedges=False)
sage: P = G.flow_polytope(edges=[(0, 1, None), (0, 1, None)])
sage: P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (1, 0), A vertex at (0, 1))
sage: P.lines()
[]
```

Weird, this does **not** happen with my installation of sage (8.9 from 2019-09-29, using python 2.7.17):

```
sage: edges = [(0, 1), (0, 1)]
sage: [[Integer(j is u) for j in edges] for u in edges]
[[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```


> but we have a simpler and more efficient solution, as we only need a diagonal of 1's.

You're right, that's all we need. I refrained from thinking about `range` because of the impending change to python 3, but its use is probably correct and suitable here, even more so after the change.

In the commit you attached, the docstring is changed accordingly:
> If not specified, the list of all edges of `self` is used with the default ordering of `self.edges()`.

Just to make you aware of it, the ordering of `edges` in `flow_polytope` is not the default ordering of `self.edges()` (at least not in my case), but instead an explicitly unordered list:

```python
if edges is None:
    edges = self.edges(sort=False)
```

This for me gives another ordering than `self.edges()` when called, which in my case is equal to 

```python
self.edges(sort=True)
```

This relates to #[ticket:22349], where you have expertise. How to best write the docstring I don't know.

Great to see we're on the same page again, but I agree with you on the `range` solution. Thanks for everything.
