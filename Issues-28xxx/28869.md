For a polynomial `f` defined over a number field `K`, when replacing `K` by its absolute field `L = K.absolute_field(names='b')` there might be an error when changing `f` with the appropriate isomorphism `f.change_ring(L.structure()[1])`.

The problem arises from the fact that `change_ring` wants to check whether the isomorphism is part of `K.Hom(L)` by calling `K.Hom(L)(L.structure()[1])` which gives an error if `L.structure()[1]` is not an instance of `NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` which it not necessarily is. Here is a minimal working example

```
sage: K.<a> = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: L.<b> = K.absolute_field()
sage: phi = L.structure()[1]
sage: phi.parent() == K.Hom(L)
True
sage: K.Hom(L)(phi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
  From: Cyclotomic Field of order 8 and degree 4
  To:   Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^4 + 1 to an element of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^4 + 1
```

The error seems a consequence of a call to `K.Hom(L)` interpreting the argument as an element of the codomain if it is not an instance of `NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens`.

Here is the example failing on `change_ring` where the error message is even less insightful

```
sage: K.<a> = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: L.<b> = K.absolute_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^2 + a
sage: f.change_ring(L.structure()[1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 
```
