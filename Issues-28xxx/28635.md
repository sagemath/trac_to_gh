```

```
Please look at the example:

sage: K.<z>=CyclotomicField(8)
sage: a=z-z^3  # a is a square root of 2
sage: a-sqrt(2)
0
sage: Q=QuadraticForm(K,8,[1/2,-a/2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1/2,-a/2,0,0,0,0,0,1/2,-1/2,0,0,
....: 0,0,1/2,-1/2,0,0,0,1/2,-1/2,0,0,1/2,-a/2,0,1/2,-a/2,1/2])
sage: Q.signature_vector()
(8, 0, 0)

this cannot be true since there exists an isotropic vector:

sage: v=vector([1,a,1,0,0,0,0,0])
sage: v*Q.matrix()*v
0
```
as mentioned in https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/lEFzCluEPuI

the suspision is that the code is using `bla>0` instead `bla.sign()>0`.
