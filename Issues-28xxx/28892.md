dependency of tornado:

```
~/src/sage.git/build/pkgs $ grep -rl 'certifi[^ce]'
certifi/checksums.ini
certifi/spkg-install
tornado/dependencies
```

However, they are no longer necessary. The setup.py file shipped with tornado-4.5.2 indicates this:

```
if sys.version_info < (2, 7, 9):
    install_requires.append('backports.ssl_match_hostname')
if sys.version_info < (3, 4):
    install_requires.append('singledispatch')
    # Certifi is also optional on 2.7.9+, although making our dependencies
    # conditional on micro version numbers seems like a bad idea
    # until we have more declarative metadata.
    install_requires.append('certifi')
```

certifi should be dead weight, except for the fact that the setup.py file still mistakenly (with a comment to that effect) requires it. Thus for certifi, I suggest we patch out that one line,

```
-    install_requires.append('certifi')
+    # install_requires.append('certifi')
```



Depends on #26919

`backports_ssl_match_hostname` was removed in #29754, so I have narrowed the ticket to `certifi`.

`tornado` is updated in #26919.
It should be checked what the situation with `certifi` is in the new version.
