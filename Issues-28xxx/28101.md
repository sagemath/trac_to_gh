I meant to post something about that. 

This release in particular breaks the building of `giacpy_sage` the following patch https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/giac/files/giac-1.5.0.61-tex_header.patch fixes it. You are welcome to forward it upstream. Note that this is the only instance of `#include <tex.h>` all the others (and there is number of them) are `"tex.h"`. I don't think that's particularly good style but it works.

For a few releases of `giac` a `giacpy_sage` doctest has been broken.

This change is not in SVN geogebra, because it's UI code (Xcas code), not Giac code.
I have added if (status!=1) in the non-FLTK code, like in the FLTK code

```c++
#ifdef HAVE_LIBFLTK
	if (status!=1)
	  xcas::Xcas_debugguer(status,contextptr);
#else
	// FIXME Debugguer without FLTK
	if (status!=1)
	  giac::thread_eval_status(1,contextptr);
#endif
```

It would be a good idea to check the resulting binary anyway.
BTW, I will probably update giac to 1.5.0-63 next week, with a small header fix reported by dimpase.

The current thread is about an issue in Xcas that affects Sagemath. It is a proof that Xcas *is* used in other projects. If Xcas was on a public VCS then it's very likely that one could merely look up the relevant change there, instead of having this discussion.

I think Bernard's point here (which I agree with, if I understand correctly) is that the original bug I found was caused by multi-threaded evaluation code that is needed by Xcas (so that giac commands can be evaluated in a thread without blocking the UI), but that is not needed by non-GUI interfaces.

The problem is that the threaded eval code had a bug, but it also wasn't even needed in the context where Sage was using it, so I just disabled use of the threaded-eval in the case where it was affecting me.

The code in[comment:16](#comment%3A16) does appear to be addressing the bug I described in #27385#comment:14

(I still think the code should be using proper condition primitives but that's a bigger change; the above fix will definitely reduce the likelihood of a problem here).
