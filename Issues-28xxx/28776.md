For the following polyhedra all things involving coercion fail.

```
sage: P = polytopes.icosahedron(); P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 with sqrt5 = 2.236067977499790?)^3 defined as the convex hull of 12 vertices
sage: P1 = polytopes.small_rhombicuboctahedron(); P1
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 with sqrt2 = 1.414213562373095?)^3 defined as the convex hull of 24 vertices

```

It seems to boil down to two issues:
- `P.base_extend(P1.base_ring())` doesn't do anything, see #28770,
- number fields can mostly not coerced by design.

Do we want to change that design for polyhedra? I think it is reasonable to coerce polyhedra over number fields by default. At least when there is exactly one composite field.

Depends on #28770
