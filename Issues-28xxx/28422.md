As pointed out in this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/AilDfydrnSI/XhO1EbALEQAJ), the keyword `verbose=True` used to trigger the check of the inverse of a transition map in `CoordChange.set_inverse()` would be better named `check=True`. This is performed in this ticket. Moreover, `check=True` is now the default (previously, it was `verbose=False`) and the printed output of the check has been improved.

Taking into account the above, a possible use of a `verbose` option would the following: if `check=True`, then 
- for `verbose=True`, print the check details (as they are now)
- for `verbose=False`, print nothing if the check is fully passed (i.e. if the variable `any_failure` defined in the code remains to `False`) and print the check details (as they are now) when some failure has occurred

Would you agree with such a behavior?
