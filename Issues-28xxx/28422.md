Taking into account the above, a possible use of a `verbose` option would the following: if `check=True`, then 
- for `verbose=True`, print the check details (as they are now)
- for `verbose=False`, print nothing if the check is fully passed (i.e. if the variable `any_failure` defined in the code remains to `False`) and print the check details (as they are now) when some failure has occurred

Would you agree with such a behavior?
