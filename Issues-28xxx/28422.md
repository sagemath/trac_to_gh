Taking into account the above, a possible use of a `verbose` option would the following: if `check=True`, then 
- for `verbose=True`, print the check details (as they are now)
- for `verbose=False`, print nothing if the check is fully passed (i.e. if the variable `any_failure` defined in the code remains to `False`) and print the check details (as they are now) when some failure has occurred

Would you agree with such a behavior?

I don't like it being overly verbose when it passes successfully. I am happy when it prints something on failure, but I don't like the noise when it passes successfully. I feel it just gets in the way.

> Well actually, in the current version, with `check=True`, it always print something out, even if the check is passed (the only thing that is not printed in that case is the sentence "NB: a failed report can reflect a mere lack of simplification"). Personally, I don't feel uneasy with a function that is verbose when some "interactivity" is implicitly asked in the form "check=True".

Okay, now I am reading the code more carefully. I don't like it being overly verbose when it passes successfully. I am happy when it prints something on failure, but I don't like the noise when it passes successfully. I feel it just gets in the way. So if you feel there is a benefit to having the data every time, then you should add a `verbose` as you proposed in [comment:6](#comment%3A6).

Addendum - This objection is only when it is the default behavior. If this was something a user had to ask for, then it wouldn't be a problem.

OK, this is done in the above commit.

OK I see your point.
