If we restore a `verbose` option, then there is no point in having `check=True` since the printed output is the only outcome of the check. In particular, no exception is raised if the check is failed. The appreciation of whether the check is passed or not is thus left to the user.

Taking into account the above, a possible use of a `verbose` option would the following: if `check=True`, then 
- for `verbose=True`, print the check details (as they are now)
- for `verbose=False`, print nothing if the check is fully passed (i.e. if the variable `any_failure` defined in the code remains to `False`) and print the check details (as they are now) when some failure has occurred

Would you agree with such a behavior?

Okay, now I am reading the code more carefully. I don't like it being overly verbose when it passes successfully. I am happy when it prints something on failure, but I don't like the noise when it passes successfully. I feel it just gets in the way. So if you feel there is a benefit to having the data every time, then you should add a `verbose` as you proposed in [comment:6](#comment%3A6).

Addendum - This objection is only when it is the default behavior. If this was something a user had to ask for, then it wouldn't be a problem.
