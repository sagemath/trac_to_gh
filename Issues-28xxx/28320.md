While it may be overkill, does that fix your python3 problem, John? If not I move to one of the fix you suggested. Lastly, since it is deprecated, there is the option of just removing `sage-cython`.

Merged 6 months ago, so it is probably too early for removal anyway. I think getting it to run with whichever python sage has been built with, is the right thing to do.

If you don't have any objections or problem with the rest of the branch, could I ask for a review :)
