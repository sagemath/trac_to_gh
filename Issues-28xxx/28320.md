Merged 6 months ago, so it is probably too early for removal anyway. I think getting it to run with whichever python sage has been built with, is the right thing to do.

If you don't have any objections or problem with the rest of the branch, could I ask for a review :)

It is possible that someone could use the  `sage-cython` script before Sage has been completely installed, but not with this change.\n\nHowever, since the whole thing is deprecated, I'm not going to worry too much about it. Sage builds with this change, so it doesn't break anything in the build process. The other changes look safe enough. Let me run a few more tests, but it's probably ready to go.",

My general feeling is that we should use `python` rather than `sage-python23` whenever possible, so I'm not delighted with this change. It is possible that someone could use the  `sage-cython` script before Sage has been completely installed, but not with this change.

However, since the whole thing is deprecated, I'm not going to worry too much about it. Sage builds with this change, so it doesn't break anything in the build process. The other changes look safe enough. Let me run a few more tests, but it's probably ready to go.
