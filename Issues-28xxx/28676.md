Either singular should depend on the python package
or `--without-python` should be passed to `configure`. Otherwise the configure script may find some unexpected python version.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
This is a problem for anyone who has a `python2.7` binary somewhere in `PATH`, for example in `/usr/local/bin`, coming from homebrew. 

With the simple patch on this ticket, in a Python 3 build of Sage, this now gives:

```
[singular-4.1.1p2.p0] checking for --with-python... sage-python23
[singular-4.1.1p2.p0] checking whether sage-python23 version >= 2.4... yes
[singular-4.1.1p2.p0] checking whether sage-python23 version >= 3... too recent, skipping python interface!
```

Looks good to me. As far as I understand, it has no effect on sagelib, only on possible use of Singular's python interface outside of sagelib.

Yes, there are no effects on sagelib. And as I remember py3 is not supported, so this interface will probably just die since upstream doesn't seem to be interested in porting it to a more recent python. Not that we should care.
