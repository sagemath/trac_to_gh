CC:  @slel @orlitzky

We implement arrays of fast_callable.
We use it when there is a need to consider
gradient or hessian of multidimensional functions
(typically `numerical/optimize.py`).

Such arrays should be compatible with
numpy arrays as with #29235.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29236
