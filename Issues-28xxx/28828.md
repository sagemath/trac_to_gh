Currently the f_vector is exposed.

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex()
sage: P.f_vector()[0] = 2
sage: P.f_vector()
(2, 4, 6, 4, 1)
```

Same applies for
- incidence matrix,
- vertex-facet graph,
- vertices matrix,
- vertex adjacency matrix,
- facet adjacency matrix,
- gale transform.

Some of the above are probably more relevant than others.

Thanks for pointing this out.

As for vectors and matrices there is `set_immutable`, which should work fine here.
I just didn't get around to doing it.

I am not sure we need to change everything to be immutable.
But since you are doing this, you may also want to consider the following:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
....: P.restricted_automorphism_group(output='matrixlist')[0][0,0] = 1000
....: P.restricted_automorphism_group(output='matrixlist')[0]
....: 
[1000    0    0    0]
[   0    1    0    0]
[   0    0    1    0]
[   0    0    0    1]

As mentioned in the description of the ticket, some methods are worse than others.

E.g. it can easily happen, that one does something with the graph. There is even an example in the doctests (the one I modified in ticket), where the original graph was reversed.
