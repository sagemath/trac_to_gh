Currently the f_vector is exposed.

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex()
sage: P.f_vector()[0] = 2
sage: P.f_vector()
(2, 4, 6, 4, 1)
```

Same applies for
- incidence matrix,
- vertex-facet graph,
- vertices matrix,
- vertex adjacency matrix,
- facet adjacency matrix,
- gale transform.

Some of the above are probably more relevant than others.

As for vectors and matrices there is `set_immutable`, which should work fine here.
I just didn't get around to doing it.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I am not sure we need to change everything to be immutable.
But since you are doing this, you may also want to consider the following:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
....: P.restricted_automorphism_group(output='matrixlist')[0][0,0] = 1000
....: P.restricted_automorphism_group(output='matrixlist')[0]
....: 
[1000    0    0    0]
[   0    1    0    0]
[   0    0    1    0]
[   0    0    0    1]

E.g. it can easily happen, that one does something with the graph. There is even an example in the doctests (the one I modified in ticket), where the original graph was reversed.
