A problem that is occurring frequently in reports of build problems is failures during building sagenb, like

```
[sagenb-1.1.2] reading sources... [ 15%] misc/misc
[sagenb-1.1.2]
[sagenb-1.1.2] Exception occurred:
[sagenb-1.1.2]   File "sage/misc/lazy_import.pyx", line 218, in sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport._get_object (build/cythonized/sage/misc/lazy_import.c:2502)
[sagenb-1.1.2]     raise RuntimeError(f"resolving lazy import {self._name} during startup")
[sagenb-1.1.2] RuntimeError: resolving lazy import dumps during startup
[sagenb-1.1.2] The full traceback has been saved in /var/folders/qf/wr6_n5s56m780kv130nznmlc0000gn/T/sphinx-err-MzyE1A.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
[sagenb-1.1.2] Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
```

However, the problem has nothing to do with sagenb--rather it's because sagenb's own build process uses sagelib, and if there was a problem building sagelib properly (such that the build succeeded without failure, but still has runtime problems) it means the build will fail for any packages that depend on sagelib.

We should somehow update the Makefile so that after building sagelib it is tested immediately, and the build is failed before building any further packages, if sage fails to start (and also it would be helpful to display any actual errors to the install log / stdout).

(Currently sagenb is the only standard package that depends on sagelib being built, and it is being slowly phased out.  However, there are optional packages that depend on sage, and may be more standard packages in the future.)
