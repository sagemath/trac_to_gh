The method `change_ring` is not always working when we pass in a morphism.

```
sage: K = GF(5^2)
sage: S.<x> = K[]
sage: P = S.random_element()
sage: P.change_ring(K.frobenius_endomorphism())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 
```

The current code is weird: it calls the method `hom` with a morphism as first argument (instead of the list the images of generators). Instead, I propose to fall back to `map_coefficients`.
