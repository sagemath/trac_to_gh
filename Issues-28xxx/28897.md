`BipartiteGraph` does currently check edges, when using the method `add_edges`:

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph()
bg.add_vertices([0, 1, 2], left=[True, False, True])
bg.add_edges([[0, 2]]) 
```

This doesn't raise an error, but it should.

While `BipartiteGraph` has its own method `add_edge`, it seems to trust generic graph do `add_edges` by iterating over the edges and calling `add_edge`. This is not the case (anymore).

We fix this, by implementing the method `add_edges` for `BipartiteGraph`, which just calls the backend on the prechecked edges.

**Keywords:** bipartite graph, add edges

Actually, the added doctest shows that we need a specific method for `add_edges`. The one of generic graph calls a backend that is not specific to bipartite graphs.

At the moment everything works fine. `add_edges` calls `add_edge`, which checks that the vertices lie in different partitions.

However, once one modifies `add_edges` to directly call the backend, `BipartiteGraph` needs a modified version of it. If we add a special version now, we still have to remember it, once we optimize `add_edges` in generic graph.

The doctest would just ensure that one doesn't miss it with little effort for now.

You must change the documentation for parameter `loops` as loops should not be allowed in a bipartite graph. I suggest to set it to `False` by default, and document that it is always considered as `False`. This is exactly what current implementation do. For instance, with this patch, we get

```
sage: G = BipartiteGraph([(0,0)], loops=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-273b7e5c1458> in <module>()
----> 1 G = BipartiteGraph([(Integer(0),Integer(0))], loops=True)

/Users/dcoudert/sage3/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.py in __init__(self, data, partition, check, *args, **kwds)
    309         else:
    310             if 'loops' in kwds and kwds['loops']:
--> 311                 raise ValueError('loops are not allowed in bipartite graphs')
    312             kwds['loops'] = False
    313 

ValueError: loops are not allowed in bipartite graphs
```

I just realized that some input parameters of `BipartiteGraph` are not documented, like `weighted`, `multiedges`, and of course `loops`.


Instead of defining a function `check_edge` and call `self._backend.add_edges(map...)`, it might be faster to make a loop `for e in edges` in which you check the validity of that edge and if the edge is ok, then call `self._backend.add_edge(u, v, label, self._directed)`. Indeed, method `self._backend.add_edges` also has to check if an edge is a pair or a triple.

Ok.

As for ignoring loops, I wouldn't allow it. In a generic graph, I can see that one wants the method to remove loops for comfort.

In a bipartite graph, one needs to clean up the input anyway. Loops is just one of many cases, where the ends of an edge are not in different parts.

Yes. But when you do

```
sage: G.add_edges([[0, 0]], loops=False)
```

it just ignores all the loops and does not raise an error (as is documented in `add_edges`).
