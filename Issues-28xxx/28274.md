This ticket solves the following problems involing `EnumeratedFamily`:

- The keys of an enumerated family should be integers. Currently, the elements of the family itself are returned.

  ```
  sage: f = Family(Permutations(4))
  sage: f.keys()
  Standard permutations of 4
  sage: list(f.keys()) == list(f)  # should not be True here
  True
  ```
  Because of this, looking up elements by key as in `f[next(iter(f.keys()))]` raises a type error. For example, this is used in `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`.

- Finite enumerated families should be in the category of `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`, while currently it is only in `EnumeratedSets()`:

  ```
  sage: Family(Permutations(4)) in FiniteEnumeratedSets()  # should be True
  False
  ```

- Infinite enumerated families are currently indexed by `NonNegativeIntegers()` from `sage.categories.example.infinite_enumerated_sets`. This ticket replaces the usage of these example numbers by those in `sage.sets.non_negative_integers`. This also includes one instance in `baxter_permutations`.

This is clearly a bug as it contradicts the documentation of `EnumeratedFamily`:

```
    :class:`EnumeratedFamily` turns an enumerated set ``c`` into a family
    indexed by the set `\{0,\dots, |c|-1\}`.
```

I don't understand this:
> The category of finite enumerated families should be in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`, while currently it is only in `EnumeratedSets()`.

in both what is supposed to mean and what was changed.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A3):
> I don't understand this:
> > The category of finite enumerated families should be in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`, while currently it is only in `EnumeratedSets()`.

> in both what is supposed to mean and what was changed.

What I meant is that the category should be a subcategory of `FiniteEnumeratedSets()` so that the following can be used to check whether the family is finite.

```
sage: Family(Permutations(4)) in FiniteEnumeratedSets()  # should be True
False
```
The category is set based on whether the type of the keys is known to be finite, such as for lists and tuples. I added `range` to this detection, which is the type of keys of `EnumeratedFamily`. This bug was probably introduced when `six.moves.range` was imported into the module, as ordinarily in Python 2 `range` returns a list.
