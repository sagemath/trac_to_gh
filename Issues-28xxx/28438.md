Call Jupyter notebooks via their executable files instead of using python imports so that the python3 version of the Jupyter stack can be used even with the python2 version of Sage. Remove the have_prerequisites check and let notebooks do their own error reporting.

If this is merged, the python2 version of the Jupyter notebook (and its dependencies) can stop being installed.

If you start jupyter-notebook from vanilla sage's root or any of the usual commands, I expect you will get the sage version because `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` will be in your `PATH`.

It seems to me that the real problem is that we would like to pass the path to the location of the kernels to `jupyter-notebook`. I'll look into that.

Thanks for taking this into consideration :)

The way I currently handle jupyter is as follows: I have a custom kernel spec (independent of the one sage generates) which can then be used either by a system-wide jupyter service or by the notebook sage launches. Jupyter is taken from the system of course and sage is wrapped with an appropriate `JUPYTER_PATH` pointing to the kernel spec.

OK, but in regards to the branch currently in this ticket, `jupyter-notebook` is assumed to be installed in the same prefix as the python interpreter.

I would be more in favor of using `jupyter-notebook` found in the `PATH` for vanilla sage we can expect it to be the first one in the `PATH` and similarly with most distributions unless you do something explicit before launching.
