Call Jupyter notebooks via their executable files instead of using python imports so that the python3 version of the Jupyter stack can be used even with the python2 version of Sage. Remove the have_prerequisites check and let notebooks do their own error reporting.

If this is merged, the python2 version of the Jupyter notebook (and its dependencies) can stop being installed.

Thanks for taking this into consideration :)

The way I currently handle jupyter is as follows: I have a custom kernel spec (independent of the one sage generates) which can then be used either by a system-wide jupyter service or by the notebook sage launches. Jupyter is taken from the system of course and sage is wrapped with an appropriate `JUPYTER_PATH` pointing to the kernel spec.
