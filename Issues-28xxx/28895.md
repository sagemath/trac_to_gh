The idea is that in the end, most top level function should be handled in `c_graph.pyx`.
If possible, only the low level functions are done separate for each backend.

Once things are unified (as good as different backends allow), one should speed up things. E.g. the following is extremely slow:

```
sage: import itertools
sage: def test_speed(n):
....:     G = Graph(n, data_structure='dense')
....:     edges = itertools.combinations(range(n), 2)
....:     %time G.add_edges(edges)
....:     edges = itertools.combinations(range(n), 2)
....:     %time G.delete_edges(edges)
sage: test_speed(1000)
CPU times: user 175 ms, sys: 8 Âµs, total: 175 ms
Wall time: 175 ms
CPU times: user 574 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 574 ms
Wall time: 574 ms
```
I got both things down to about 80 ms by calling `add_edges` on the top level and then actually using the unsafe methods wherever possible (if we already obtained the indices safely, there should be nothing preventing as from using unsafe methods). Similar for `delete_edges`.

Adding this, because I missed it on my first try to optimize `add_edges`. This would have created a mistake in `BipartiteGraph` without a doctest catching on.
