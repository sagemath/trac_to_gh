Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.

More precisely we replace an attribute by a private attribute (with leading `_`) and add a method without leading `_`. E.g. the attribute `far_face_tuple` is replaced by `_far_face_tuple` and we add a method `far_face_tuple(self)`. Thus we gain flexibility in the sense that those attributes must not be set on initialization.

This is motivated by #10777.

We remove the attribute `Vinv` completely, as it is not being used.
