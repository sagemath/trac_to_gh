`ETuple` used in exponents of generic multivariate polynomials implement their own iterator `ETupleIter` which is broken with respect to

```
sage: from array import array
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: e = (x*y*z).exponents()[0]
sage: array('l', e)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETupleIter' object is not iterable
```
Now that Cython is more modern than at the time this was implemented we get rid of this custom iterator.

-sage: it = iter([1,2,3])
