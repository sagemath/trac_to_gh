#28745 updates the installation manual and explains the use of `SAGE_ROOT/environment[-optional].yml`.

As section in the developer's guide should explain the use of `SAGE_ROOT/src/environment-[optional].yml`


... from https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda

including answers to the following questions (from #31099):

- How do I now create a conda environment with a given name in a given location with the sage dependencies installed, and activate this env later and run say the doctests? Similarly, say I've created a conda env myself and activated it. 
- How can I now install the sage dependencies and run tests/lints using tox in this env?
