New functionalities:

* computation of shifted minimal kernel bases (e.g. via approximant bases at large order and/or via Zhou-Labahn-Storjohann 2012),
* verification that a matrix is a shifted minimal kernel basis. 

This should be done in a general context:

* accepting non-uniform shifts,
* allowing to work row-wise or column-wise,
* offering the possibility of obtaining the canonical basis (that is, the one in shifted Popov form).

We do have `minimal_approximant_basis` , indeed the first approach directly builds upon this. The second approach was not incorporated in the end since it did not provide sufficient gains (we would need faster polynomial matrix multiplication for it to make sense).

> * Note that we don't yet have a `M.popov_form()` method. If we already had that, then the ticket's last suggested functionality really becomes a question of optimisation rather than added functionality.
 
Indeed. By the way, writing a Popov form algorithm should be done; it is not much to do since there is already a weak Popov form algorithm.
