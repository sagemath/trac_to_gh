New functionalities:

* computation of shifted minimal kernel bases (e.g. via approximant bases at large order and/or via Zhou-Labahn-Storjohann 2012),
* verification that a matrix is a shifted minimal kernel basis. 

This should be done in a general context:

* accepting non-uniform shifts,
* allowing to work row-wise or column-wise,
* offering the possibility of obtaining the canonical basis (that is, the one in shifted Popov form).

Hi,

Thanks Johan for your input.

The ticket functionalities are now written. Can you please check if you see any issue?

Since `minimal_approximant_basis` now already exists (answering your third point) I chose to follow the same naming, i.e. `minimal_kernel_basis` (answering your first point). Still, these names can be discussed and we could get rid of `minimal_` in both.

Your second and fourth points: yes, this is right. Also, since the implemented `minimal_approximant_basis` algorithm already allows to return the Popov form (with small overhead compared to weak Popov), and since the chosen kernel basis algorithm is essentially a call to that algorithm at sufficiently high order, it made sense to do it this way rather computing a weak Popov kernel basis and then calling another normalization procedure (which indeed is not yet written, this is clearly a missing basic feature).

For your last point: yes, this is right. I implemented this with plain multiplication for `M*K==0` (no Freivalds or such), and for the saturation I compute a HNF basis of the column space: this is the identity matrix iff the (full rank) matrix is row-saturated. Here as well, a Popov form algorithm would also work (instead of HNF) and would probably be somewhat faster.

Perhaps the function here should be called `left_kernel_basis`, without the explicit "minimal". This is under the assumption that whenever a user asks for (a basis of) the (left/right) kernel of an `F[x]` matrix, he should/would invariably prefer a reduced basis of the kernel, represented over `F[x]` again. Note similarly that when you ask for a `left_kernel().basis_matrix()` of a `Q`-matrix, you get one in rref form.

I guess we could make use of the new function to implement the core of `left_kernel` (just need to make a module from the computed basis matrix, if I follow correctly). One advantage is that we have freedom of the shift here: we could take it as the one yielding best performance, i.e. the row degrees of the input matrix.

Yes, this is how it is done.

We do have `minimal_approximant_basis` , indeed the first approach directly builds upon this. The second approach was not incorporated in the end since it did not provide sufficient gains (we would need faster polynomial matrix multiplication for it to make sense).

> * Note that we don't yet have a `M.popov_form()` method. If we already had that, then the ticket's last suggested functionality really becomes a question of optimisation rather than added functionality.

Indeed. By the way, writing a Popov form algorithm should be done; it is not much to do since there is already a weak Popov form algorithm.
