This metaticket proposes to use mainstream Python testing and linting infrastructure for Sage -- by adding configuration files and documentation.

**tox**:
- #28987 Add `src/tox.ini`: As an alternative interface to running the sage doctester.

- #30448 (src/tox.ini: Add validation of rst files and docstrings via a quick docbuild)


**pytest**:
- #31003 Add minimal pytest configuration
- #31103 `sage.numerical.backends`: Replace use of `TestSuite` by `pytest`
- #30362 Add symplectic structures
- #32975 Improve doctest interaction with pytest
- #33549 Rename `test_...` functions to avoid the naming scheme reserved by pytest

- #33572 `sage -pytest`
- #33560 pytest: ignore cython files
- #33561 Rename `test_...` classes to avoid the naming scheme reserved by pytest

- #30415 (Remove pyflakes?)


Documentation tickets:

I don't know what you mean by "preferred interface" here.  There isn't really any such thing as a preferred interface.  It's just being proposed here as a recommendation over `setup.py test`.  Sage doesn't use `setup.py test` anyways so there's nothing that needs to be "replaced" with a different interface if/when `setup.py` goes away.

The main advantage to tox is the ability to run a package's tests across multiple runtime environments (esp. different Python versions).  This isn't really possible currently with Sage; it would actually be very difficult to use tox in any sensible manner with Sage.

If someone wants to do this anyways I don't see the harm really, but I'm not sure what problem it would be solving.

FWIW, I managed to use `tox` on top of the sage installation, see https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/blob/master/tox.ini: The trick is to run `tox` with `sitepackages = true` and an `install_command` that installs into the user scheme. With this trick, after all, no new plugin for `tox` is needed to handle the sage environment.

-`tox` seems to be the preferred interface for running tests - see for example https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/931 (deprecation of `setup.py test`).
+`tox` is a popular package for advertising the testing/linting infrastructure of a Python project by listing them in one configuration file `tox.ini`; it supports running tests in isolated virtual environments.
 
-We should create a `tox` plugin (https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html)
-- for testing `sagelib` (as an alternative to `sage -t`)
-- for users' packages that depend on sage. 
+A typical example of `tox.ini`: https://opendev.org/openstack/neutron/raw/branch/master/tox.ini

+- Add linters equivalent to those reported by patchbot: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/master/sage_patchbot/plugins.py:
