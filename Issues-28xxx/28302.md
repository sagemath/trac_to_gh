According to the [reference manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/persist.html) the commands loads/save are supposed to give an easy way to save and retrieve data on a hard drive. Sadly this is not safe accross different Sage versions.

This should either be widely advertized in the documentation, emitting a warning or a stopgap.

The link to the manual does not work.

I doubt save/load is **supposed** to work across different Sage versions. 

The gist of the problem is whether a pickled object from an old Sage version can be unpickled and work in current Sage version. Python's pickling protocol does not guarantee this.

I think this problem is not directly related with whether we maintain pickle jar or not.

A sage object is tied to a specific Sage version. Hence if we want an object pickled in old Sage can be unpickled and working in current Sage,
the object should be pickled with Sage version information and in unpickling, should be **upgraded** incrementally to current Sage. 

I think what Sage lacks is this upgrading mechanism for objects pickled in old Sage version. Pickle jar would be necessary to check whether this upgrading mechanism is functioning.

Let me show my idea. The upgrading mechanism is coded to `sage_object` class:

```
    def __getstate__(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_getstate_'):
            state = self._getstate_()
        else:
            state = self.__dict__.copy()
        state['sage_version'] = 5  # current Sage version

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        if 'sage_version' in state:
            version = state['sage_version']
            del state['sage_version']
        else:
            version = None
        self.__dict__.update(state)
        if version is not None and hasattr(self, '_upgrade'):
            self._upgrade(from_vesion=version)
```
and this is written to the class of objects that needs to be upgraded from old Sage:

```

    def _upgrade(self, from_version=None):
        version = from_version
        if version < 4:
            # upgrade to version 4
            self.weight = 10
            # now self is an object of sage version 4
            version = 4
        if version < 5:
            # upgrade to version 5
            del self.weight
            # now self is an object of sage version 5
            version = 5    
```

But I guess the real solution would be far more complex, but this would be start.

I believe the only solution here is better documentation emphasizing that `save()`/`load()` use pickle, and are not guaranteed to work between different versions of Sage, or even different versions of Python, and should only be used for temporary storage, not long-term portable serialization.

Indeed, the fact that we should advertise to not use `save/load` was even discussed [in this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/dZwxUCNEZWk/joIzOT0aBAAJ).

Do you have any suggestion for "long-term portable serialization"?

I agree that we should avoid this misunderstanding about `save` and `load`. I had it one and a half year ago, too. But surely, it is much more annoying if you have published `sobj`-files that run out date as in the case from the sage-devel-thread! 

On the other hand, if these functions will be disabled I would appreciate to have an option to force their use, even so. Similarly, if there will be a warning, an option to suppress it would be nice. The reason is, that I found a way, which works pretty good in my case where the Sage objects are matrices with entries in

```
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in u, v over Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in w over Integer Ring
```

respectively

```
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in a, b, c over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in e3 over Integer Ring with modulus e3^2 + e3 + 1
```

I converted them (recursively) into `python dictionaries` (over `python dictionaries` ...) ending up with values which are nothing but `python int`. There is very good support by Sage to convert to and from such dictionaries (but this may be different in other cases, as for example with number fields). 

Thus, my `sobj`-files have been robust against version upgrades since than (and the conversion saved some disk space, as well)! Sure, there is no guarantee that compatibility will keep forever. But the chance is better since this is closer to kernel functionality.


Maybe there is a way, to have such a solution being supported more systematically.

Certainly no one is proposing disabling or removing them.  Just better clarifying what it is and is not appropriate for (I would say, short-term caching, mainly).

We could also maybe do better about storing with `.sobj` files the Sage version with which they were created (if we don't already; I think maybe we do?).

Maybe I misunderstood this. But, is there really a (generic) way, to suppress the warning of a deprecated function or method? 

I had trouble with a deprecation (ticket #16613), which is not implemented completely, that means: there is still library-code left using the deprecated method (I implemented a fix for this in #26421, but better would have done this in a separate ticket). So, how can you get rid of the warning in such a case (apart from waiting until the fix is reviewed)?

> We could also maybe do better about storing with `.sobj` files the Sage version with which they were created (if we don't already; I think maybe we do?).  Still allow them to be loaded with newer Sage versions if possible, but provide a better error message if not, including the Sage version that should be used to load them.

To enlarge transparency about the version an sobj-file is created for is the one thing. But in addition, wouldn't it be worth to improve the stability against version upgrades as I was claiming above? 

I think most of the objects, people want to save to disk are instances of element classes. Many of these classes have methods to convert to a dictionary, whose values are instances of element classes again. I think the latter should be more stable against version upgrades as the former, since usually it is closer to kernel functionality. In the cases I explained in my former post, the recursion ends up with integers. 

Furthermore, many parent classes have an `_element_constructor_` doing the opposite conversion. So in all such cases, the stability against version upgrades could be improved similarly as I have done it for the matrices over some types of polynomial rings.

Of course, the problem has two sides:
- A Sage user may have old data and wants to use them in a new Sage version.
- A Sage user may have new data and wants to use them in future Sage versions.

If I understand correctly what you are saying:

> Sage doesn't even *attempt* to offer a way to permanently and reliably store user data. If a pickle of user data created by some months of computation time in Sage-x.y.z can not be read in Sage-x.y.(z+1), then it is just tough luck for the user, but isn't considered a bug. And all is good if we simply write in the documentation that a user shouldn't use Sage to store mathematical data.


If that understanding of your statements is correct then I very strongly disagree with you. 
And that's also something that I find very disturbing in Python-3: Apparently, Python-2 str basically is the same as Python-3 bytes, and Python-2 unicode basically is the same as Python-3 str. But, surprisesurprise: Python-3 attempts to unpickle the pickle of a Python-2 str as Python-3 str (*not* as Python-3 bytes) -- which isn't exactly consistent (and fails in some cases).

Granted, it can happen that a Sage-x.y.z pickle cannot be unpickled in Sage-x.y.(z+1). However, if that happens then it clearly is a bug and it is our duty to *attempt* to fix it. Within reason, of course. But in the first place it *is our duty*. And since the default way of storing Sage data used to be pickling, we should acknowledge that it is a bug if an old pickle cannot be unpickled by a new Sage version.

I believe that any self-respecting software project should provide at least one way of storing data with the promise that the stored data will still be useable in future versions of the software. Of course, there may be different approaches to keep that promise. Such us: Provide a conversion function that turns the data format of version x.y into the data format of version x.(y+1), so that the user can access old stored data version x.y by repeated application of such functions, and then use them in version x.(y+15). However, it is *not* ok to tell the user: "Well, you may have data from version x.y, but you will not be able to use the old data together with the cool new features of version x.(y+15)".

So, in the beginning of this thread, I have proposed an upgrade mechanism of sage objects from a version to another version of sage. I modified it further. The idea is to add into `sage_object.pyx` something like

```
    def __getstate__(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_getstate_'):
            state = self._getstate_()
        elif hasattr(self, '__dict__'):
            state = self.__dict__.copy()
        else:
            state = dict()

        from sage.env import SAGE_VERSION
        v = SAGE_VERSION.split('.')
        major = int(v[0])
        minor = int(v[1])
        state['sage_version'] = major * 100 + minor
        return state

    def __setstate__(self, state):
        if 'sage_version' in state:
            version = state['sage_version']
            del state['sage_version']
        else:
            version = None

        if hasattr(self, '_setstate_'):
            self._setstate_(state)
        elif hasattr(self, '__dict__'):
            self.__dict__.update(state)
        else:
            self.__dict__ = state

        if version is not None and hasattr(self, '_upgrade'):
            self._upgrade(from_version=version)

    def _upgrade(self, from_version):
        version = from_version
        if version < 800:
            # upgrade to version 801
            self._upgradable = True
            # now self is an object of Sage version 8.1
            version = 800
        if version < 809:
            # upgrade to version 902
            del self._upgradable
            # now self is an object of Sage version 9.2
            version = 809    
```

I wonder why no one makes a comment on the idea... Is it a bad idea?

Erik, this is actually a wrong statement. From the pickle documentation

```
The pickle serialization format is guaranteed to be backwards
compatible across Python releases provided a compatible pickle
protocol is chosen and pickling and unpickling code deals with
Python 2 to Python 3 type differences if your data is crossing
that unique breaking change language boundary.
```

If Python makes that promise then I believe it really is a bug (and not just an oddity) that Python-3 cannot unpickle some strings that were pickled with Python-2. See #28444.

EDIT: "cannot" means that one needs to add the new keyword `encoding="bytes"` to successfully unpickle. But without the keyword, it fails.

It is indeed not a bug. The promise is "up to pickling protocol" and "Python2/Python3 datastructure differences".

As it is, the current `save/load` based on pickling is not provisioned to work across versions. But I think we should and could make efforts to make it so.

`_upgrade` would be provided for a class of objects only when there is a change in the internal data structure of the class and thus  unpickling breaks. The developer who is responsible of the breakage should implement the `_upgrade` function.

What could be "default" for `_upgrade`? I don't understand.

That is done **in** the `_upgrade` function. See `if version < ...:  version ...` statements. The sequence of `if` statements would upgrade the object in steps ultimately to the present version.

For those classes of objects with custom `__reduce__`, perhaps we should customize the `__reduce__` method further to incorporate the upgrading mechanism. But I didn't think about these details. Also I don't think classes with custom `__reduce__` is common. What is common is those `UniqueRepresentation` classes. But for them, there is just one implementation of `__reduce__`.

I'm sorry for that, as well. It is in no way a bad idea. But I have some doubts, that pickling could become robust against version upgrades in principle. In my point of view it looks like an *raw egg* and the question is whether to just increase its protection or take into account the option to *boil* it before transportation. 

One problem I see is that pickling serializes all related instances independent whether they are simple structured or not. Thus the chance that changes in data structure will harm pickling is really high. Your suggestion would heal such violations, if they where detected. But how can you guarantee that developers and reviewers of all such harmful changes will notice that they should implement or adapt an `_upgrade` method?

I made some tests on how an option to *boil the egg* could look like (using your idea, as well) and documented this in a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket28302/demo_yaml.ipynb) I've attached to that ticket.

I think we should do both: Make pickling more save and think about another format!
