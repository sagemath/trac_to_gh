**fraction.Fraction**

In Sage 8.8 the code:

```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: Fraction(1, 1)
```

raises the following error:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-0c4690dff1ca> in <module>()
----> 1 Fraction(Integer(1), Integer(1))

/Applications/SageMath-8.8.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/lib/python2.7/fractions.pyc in __new__(cls, numerator, denominator)
    152             isinstance(denominator, Rational)):
    153             numerator, denominator = (
--> 154                 numerator.numerator * denominator.denominator,
    155                 denominator.numerator * numerator.denominator
    156                 )

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'builtin_function_or_method' and 'builtin_function_or_method'
```

This appears to be because of the fact that Python ints have numerator and denominator properties whereas for Sage integers these are methods. Therefore Fraction does not call these attributes leading to the crash

Note, turning off the pre-parser or doing:

```
sage: Fraction(int(1), int(1))
Fraction(1, 1)
```
works.

One solution to this would be to decorate sage.rings.integer.Integer.numerator() and sage.rings.integer.Integer.denominator() with the `@`property decorator, but this will likely cause a large number of systems to break.

Earlier report of this issue
in [#10928, comment 14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10928#comment:14) (a ticket about getitem of numpy matrix using Sage integers).

**statistics.mean** (see #29662)

Although the `as_integer_ratio` mechanism has been added to Python, ​`statistics._exact_ratio` does not use `as_integer_ratio` because it sees the Sage numbers' `numerator` and `denominator` methods and tries to use them as properties.

**itertools.permutations**

This issue also appears to affect Sage rationals where

```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: Fraction(3/4)
Fraction(<built-in method numerator of sage.rings.rational.Rational object at 0x17d185ad0>, <built-in method denominator of sage.rings.rational.Rational object at 0x17d185ad0>)
```

since 3/4 is a sage Rational, which is a numbers.Rational and so during initialisation this block is triggered:

```
101         if denominator is None:
102             if isinstance(numerator, Rational):
103                 self._numerator = numerator.numerator
104                 self._denominator = numerator.denominator
105                 return self
```

which sets the numerator and denominator of the fraction to be the numerator and denominator *methods* of 3/4.

Indeed, when Sage number classes were registered into Python numbers abstract base classes (#19571),
it was overlooked that the Python numbers abc specifies rationals should have a numerator property
and denominator property, while in Sage they are methods that one needs to call.

Some solutions discussed at Sage Days 100:

- do nothing: then users must do different things for Sage numbers or Python numbers
- change Sage, with a deprecation period and temporary fix where calling a Sage integer with no arguments returns this integer, with a warning
- change Python

I have attached a potential patch for discussion which:
1. Marks the numerator and denominator methods of Integer and Rational as properties using the property decorator
2. Creates full numer and denom methods of Rational which return these properties
3. Makes integers callable but:
   a. Raises a TypeError (as before) if they are called with anything
   b. Generates a sage.misc.superseded.deprecation warning referring to this ticket and returns self if they are called without any arguments.

This means that if `x = 7` then doing `x.numerator` returns `7` while doing `x.numerator()` is evaluated via `7()` which, thanks to case 3b, generates a deprecation and then returns `7`. A similar process happens if `x = 7/3`, although in this case no deprecation warning is raised when using the `x.denom()` which is provided as an alias.

a good point:
- It indeed solves the problem and remains backward compatible

Some problems:
- It affects a *lot* of files inside the Sage source code (at least 142 present doctest error) - this is easily solvable by patching the said files. But this kind of patch bomb might overlap with ongoing work of other people.
- There are several other objects with a `numerator/denominator` method in Sage. Having integers and rationals behaving differently than the rest of Sage would be really weird. A solution would be: just do the same for other objects. But then the patch bomb becomes even bigger...

Regarding this, these appear to come in two flavours:
1. The testing framework is not happy with deprecation warnings, 
2. This now makes the Sage Integer class callable and it appears that there are doctest that determine whether an object is an integer or not by testing whether it is callable!

While 1 could be solved by just removing the warning, 2 will involve making changes to hundreds of tests.

Another suggestion that could be considered, is to make numerator and denominator properties throughout Sage. Obviously such a change would not be backward compatible. Therefore it may have a major impact on external code that others have written - which must be taken into consideration. 

However, within /src/sage/:
1. There are only only 22 instances of "def numerator(" and 36 instances of "def denominator("
2. In both cases, one is a function and the remainder are methods of classes. Of the latter, all-bar-two are properties (that is, their only argument is self)
3. There are 482 uses of .numerator() and 650 uses of .denominator()
4. Of these 31 and 31 are calls of the non-properties methods.

This suggest that 52 of these methods could have the `@`property decorators added relatively simply, and 4 exception methods will require some thought / care*. Similarly 1070 uses of these methods could be replaced via a direct substitution and 62 uses will require some care. So it appears that the effort required to implement within the Sage source, while large, would be relatively low as the majority of the work could be done with a find-and-replace.

*The exceptional methods are:

```
./src/sage/rings/continued_fraction.py:    def denominator(self, n):
./src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx:    def denominator(self, bint normalize=True):
```
While the exceptional function that does not need to be changed is:

```
./src/sage/misc/functional.py:def denominator(x):
```

The above commits deals with the issues raised in comment 9. It does this by 
1. removing the deprecation warning - this could be added in in a later ticket and updating the relevant doctests to reflect this.
2. Replacing all uses of `hasattr(x, '__call__')` with `callable(x)`
3. Then replacing all uses of `callable(x)` with `callable(x) and not isinstance(x, numbers.Integral)`

This now means that the doctests pass and that doing 

```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: Fraction(3, 7)
Fraction(3, 7)
sage: Fraction(3/7)
Fraction(3, 7)
```
works.

This is silly:

```
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if args or kwargs:
            raise TypeError("'{}.{}' object is not callable".format(self.__class__.__module__, self.__class__.__name__))
```
If you don't want to support `*args` or `**kwargs`, just write

```
    def __call__(self):
        return self
```
which is more efficient.

I also disagree with

```
        # If in the future we decide to deprecate this functionality then we can add:
        #   deprecation(28234, 'callable integers are only intended as a tempory patch until .numerator and .denominator properties are used everywhere')
        # This will require updating a large number of doctests to reflect this warning so we leave this for a future ticket.
```
I would rather keep the method as normal usage instead of deprecating it.

I agree that this is ugly and that it may impact performance. However it is necessary in at least some (in fact I believe a large percentage) of the `callable(x)` cases (for example, see ​https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.py#L1523). Without these the route through the code changes and so if they are omitted then the code raises an error. The tricky thing here is that (like in the above example) the error is often raised far away from where the callable(x) occurred, making these hard to track down.

It may be possible to remove some of these uses when you explicitly know that `x` is never a Sage Integer. However I would be extremely worried about these cases since if you are wrong then it is possible that the code does not raise an error but may compute a incorrect result. Now hopefully there would be doctests that would run all of these different possibilities but this may be a situation that people aren't expecting and so I'm not sure that we can rely on the doctests to save us.

Therefore I would strongly argue that these changes are needed everywhere. In fact, even in the few cases where it is completely obvious that `x` cannot be a Sage Integer, it may be better to keep these purely for consistency.

We need to make sure that Cython supports it too. Since PEP 590 is so new, it's not in the current stable release. But the big upcoming Cython 3.0 should at least partially support it.

Some mathematical packages for dynamics, geometry and topology of
surfaces and 3-manifolds, such as Curver, Flipper, SnapPy, Twister,
Veerer, can be run either with pure Python, or with Sage. Some of
them use the `Fraction` constructor from Python's `fractions` module,
which works with Python ints or rationals and fails with Sage
integers or rationals. That's the real-world problem.

OK, I quickly looked at these packages. First of all, I couldn't find a package called "Veerer".

Two don't use fractions:

- [flipper](https://github.com/MarkCBell/flipper)
- [twister](https://bitbucket.org/Mark_Bell/twister/src/default/)

Two do use fractions:

- [curver](https://github.com/MarkCBell/curver)
- [snappy](https://pypi.org/project/snappy/2.7)

However, it's not obvious to me how Sage integers or rationals could end up as an argument to `Fraction` in these packages. curver doesn't use Sage at all. snappy does use Sage (for example, for Gröbner basis computations), but it seems that output from Sage is converted to snappy data structures, so it doesn't really do computations with Sage data types.

Agreed.

As we make the PEP idea better, we should also think about making `Rational` an easy drop-in replacement for `Fraction`. In other words, the following kind of thing should work

```
try:
    from sage.rings.rational import Rational as Fraction
except ImportError:
    try:
        from gmpy2 import mpq as Fraction
    except ImportError:
        from fractions import Fraction
```
I see a serious obstruction for now: the constructors are not compatible.

```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: from gmpy2 import mpq
sage: Fraction(2r, 3r)
Fraction(2, 3)
sage: mpq(2,3)
mpq(2,3)
sage: Rational(2,3)   # second argument is "base"
2
```

Sage Integers can end up in Fractions whenever a user uses these packages interactively or from within a sage script / notebook. For example:

```
sage: import curver
sage: curver.load(2, 1).triangulation([0, 99, 99, 1, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0])
```

crashes since the values that are passed to the functions within curver are sage Integers. This happens even though curver has scattered throughout it lines (equivalent to):

```
    assert isinstance(n, numbers.Integral)
```
but since Sage Integers have been registered as Integral these catches do not work.

Of course, doing

```
sage: curver.load(2, 1).triangulation([0r, 99r, 99r, 1r, 100r, 0r, 0r, 0r, 0r])
```
works without an issue.

def prod_numerator_denominator(x):
    ''' Since x = p / q (where q is possibly 1), return p * q. '''
    try:
        # If x is Rational then this will work.
        return x.numerator * x.denominator
    except:
        # x was not a Rational, so we can take q == 1 and just return x
        return x

assert prod_numerator_denominator(Fraction(3r, 2r)) == 6
assert prod_numerator_denominator(3) == 3
assert prod_numerator_denominator(3 / 2) == 6  # Fails since prod_numerator_denominator(3 / 2) returns 3
 ```

Or even

```
def f(x):
    if not isinstance(x, numbers.Rational):
        return NotImplemented

    # So now I know x is a Rational and so implements .numerator and .denominator properties
    try:
        return x.numerator + x.denominator
    except:
        # I know the code here can never be run so I can it should be safe to put something bad here
        import os
        os.remove('/')
```

To me an obvious answer here is for Sage `Rational`s and `Integer`s to just get some kind of `.as_pyfraction()` method to convert them to a `Fraction`.

It's not ideal of course. One would really prefer to see it just work, transparently. But when interfaces collide the only recourse, if you can't easily change the interfaces, is to make some kind of adapter.

Replying to [slelievre](#comment%3A49):
> I often wished there was `a.num_denom()`

It's called `.as_integer_ratio()` and it will be supported in Python 3.8 for all standard numeric types (`int`, `float`, `decimal.Decimal` and `fractions.Fraction`). Clearly, this is something that Sage types should also have.

This doesn't yet solve the problem that this ticket wants to solve, but it's getting closer.
