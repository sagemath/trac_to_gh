I had created new methods to compare the time complexities etc. Now the methods have been merged and written in Cython.

Right, I did not though about it. Sorry.

> Now the methods have been merged and written in Cython.

Well, if I understand well what you did, you simply declared the type of some variables and used a c++ priority queue instead of a Python queue at the cost of storing all reported paths in a list. This is not good enough. and I disagree with the current use of `idx_to_path` as this list may become giant.

Can't you try to identify first which parts of the methods are critical and could certainly be improved ?

I don't see much of a scope of improvement from algorithm point of view right now in these methods.  If you have any ideas , please let me know. But these methods are currently in cython now, in alignment with other methods of this module path_enumeration.pyx and faster.

It seems that when starting_vertices and ending_vertices are not single vertex then these paths are 
not in increasing no. of edges. 


"What if we used a priority queue instead of a queue in _all_paths_iterator ? As this behavior seems intependent of the changes done here, this can be post-pone to a future patch. "

I tried it but still the results are not in increasing order of edges.

We can fix it in next patch either to reorganize the algorithm to print paths in order of increasing number of edges or stating in simple paths that edges will be in increasing order in case of a single src and destination.
