Tried on py2-based and py3-based [SageMath](SageMath) on macOS 10.10.5. All tests pass.

Will test on Linux and Windows too before giving positive review (unless someone beats me to it).

Nevermind, this doesn't have anything to do with Cython (it just happened to occur in the `sage.misc.cython` tests).  There's one test that raises an error from GCC and the locale was in French ("compilation terminé").  Sage's doctest runner bugs out on Python 2 on tracebacks containing non-ASCII characters.

I'm still testing this ticket anyways but I suspect it will be fine.
