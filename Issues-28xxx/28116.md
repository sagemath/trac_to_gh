Nevermind, this doesn't have anything to do with Cython (it just happened to occur in the `sage.misc.cython` tests).  There's one test that raises an error from GCC and the locale was in French ("compilation terminé").  Sage's doctest runner bugs out on Python 2 on tracebacks containing non-ASCII characters.

I'm still testing this ticket anyways but I suspect it will be fine.

In principle I don't mind, but only if the ticket will actually be reviewed (if this ticket stalls again, then maybe Cython 0.29.14 will be released, leading to an endless cycle).
