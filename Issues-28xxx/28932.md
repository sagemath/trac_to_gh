The `QuadraticField` constructor takes a boolean argument `embedding`, according to its documentation:

```
    -  ``embedding`` - bool or square root of D in an
       ambient field (default: True)
```

but `embedding=False` raises an error, which is fixed by this ticket:

```
sage: QuadraticField(3, embedding=False)
...
AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'parent'
```
