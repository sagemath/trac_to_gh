The `leftmost_covering_set` function does not work properly:

```
sage: v = Word('aaaaa')
sage: Tv = v.suffix_tree()
sage: Tv.leftmost_covering_set()
[[4, 2], [], [8], [6], [4]]
```

Is that wrong? Shouldn't `i+l` be smaller than the length of the word, since it is the position where the factors are supposed to end?
I think the errors are in the 2nd condition. Testing it with the word `'aaaaa'` on the first block (of size 1), the 2nd condition returns `[(-1, 4), (-2, 6), (-3, 8)]`, which seems a bit weird, the first entry of the tuple being the position at which the square starts.
Please, fix it and add a test/example to make sure this casee is covered.
If you fix this, I'm ok with `leftmost_covering_set`.

For `square_vocabulary`, I think you should be more explicit in the description and say what the pairs are (a //couple// containing the position at which the square starts and its length).

Great! I'm happy with most of the changes and the algorithm for squares is indeed faster than the naive one.

With the naive algorithm, I had:

```
sage: w = words.ThueMorseWord()[:1000]
sage: %timeit squares(w)
10 loops, best of 3: 72.3 ms per loop
sage: u = words.ThueMorseWord()[:2000]
sage: %timeit squares(u)
1 loop, best of 3: 283 ms per loop
```
while the new one gives

```
sage: w = words.ThueMorseWord()[:1000]
sage: %timeit w.squares()
10 loops, best of 3: 30.5 ms per loop
sage: u = words.ThueMorseWord()[:2000]
sage: %timeit u.squares()
10 loops, best of 3: 60.8 ms per loop
```
which is much faster.

I'll repeat what I suggested in comment:9, because you seem to have forgotten to apply it:
> For `square_vocabulary`, I think you should be more explicit in the description and say what the pairs are (a //couple// containing the position at which the square starts and its length). 

If you disagree with this comment, I'd like to hear your point of view. Otherwise, please change it.
