The polymake interface is confused with Sage number fields that are not of the form `QQ[sqrt(D)]`. Here is a simple example

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: K = NumberField(x^2 - x -1, 'a', embedding=(1-AA(5).sqrt())/2)
sage: a = K.gen()
sage: L = NumberField(x^2 - 5, 'b', embedding=AA(5).sqrt())
sage: b = L.gen()
sage: polymake(a)
0+1r5
sage: polymake(b)
0+1r5
sage: polymake(a) * polymake(a)
5
sage: polymake(b) * polymake(b)
5
```

As a consequence, constructing polytopes with polymake backend is completely broken

```
sage: f = Hom(K, L)([(1-b)/2])
sage: Kverts = [(0,0,a),(1,a,2-a),(2*a,3,1),(2-a,5+2*a,3*a-7),(-3,2*a-1,-1),(1,a,a)]
sage: Lverts = [list(map(f, v)) for v in Kverts]
sage: Polyhedron(Kverts, base_ring=K, backend='polymake').f_vector()
(1, 6, 12, 8, 1)
sage: Polyhedron(Lverts, base_ring=L, backend='polymake').f_vector()
(1, 5, 9, 6, 1)
```
One can check that it is the second one which is correct

```
sage: Polyhedron(Kverts, base_ring=K, backend='field').f_vector()
(1, 5, 9, 6, 1)
sage: Polyhedron(Lverts, base_ring=L, backend='field').f_vector()
(1, 5, 9, 6, 1)
```

Note: This is tested with the `jupymake` interface but it should not matter (?)
