Actually, looking at the version of `cvxopt` which is in Sage, its `INSTALL` file says

```
To test that the installation was successful, go to the examples directory 
and try one of the examples, for example, 

     cd examples/doc/chap8
     python lp.py
```
I just downloaded version 1.2.3, and its `INSTALL` file says

```
To test that the installation was successful, run the included tests using

     python -m unittest discover -s tests

or alternatively, if `nose` is installed,

     nosetests
```
So we could update to 1.2.3 and use `nose`.
