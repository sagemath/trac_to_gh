In Sage 9.0.beta8, for a float, `continued_fraction` works
but `continued_fraction_list` does not:

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: x = random()
sage: x
0.111439293741037
sage: continued_fraction(x)
[0; 8, 1, 36, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 6, 1, 12, 1, 1, 10, 1, 4]
sage: continued_fraction_list(x)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

One would expect:

```
sage: continued_fraction_list(x)
[0, 8, 1, 36, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 6, 1, 12, 1, 1, 10, 1, 4]
```
