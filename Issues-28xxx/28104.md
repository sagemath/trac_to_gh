On some arch openblas fails to select a sgemm kernel implementation:

```
gcc -O2 -DMAX_STACK_ALLOC=2048 -Wall -m64 -DF_INTERFACE_GFORT -fPIC -DNO_AVX512 -DNO_WARMUP -DMAX_CPU_NUMBER=1 -DMAX_PARALLEL_NUMBER=1 -DUSE_TLS -DVERSION=\"0.3.6\" -DASMNAME=sgemm_kernel -DASMFNAME=sgemm_kernel_ -DNAME=sgemm_kernel_ -DCNAME=sgemm_kernel -DCHAR_NAME=\"sgemm_kernel_\" -DCHAR_CNAME=\"sgemm_kernel\" -DNO_AFFINITY -I.. -UDOUBLE  -UCOMPLEX -c -UDOUBLE -UCOMPLEX ../kernel/x86_64/ -o sgemm_kernel.o
gcc: warning: ../kernel/x86_64/: linker input file unused because linking not done
```
Should have been `../kernel/x86_64/<implementation>.c`

Upstream bug report: https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2176

This ticket fixes a secondary issue, namely we already build openblas with TARGET=ATOM as a fallback if autodetection fails. But building a different configuration on a dirty build dir is not supported, and can lead to linking errors 

```
/usr/bin/ld: ../libopenblas_atom-r0.3.6.a(ssymv_U.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against undefined symbol `PREFETCHSIZE' can not be used when 
making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
```
where build artifacts are mixed. We should run "make clean" first.
