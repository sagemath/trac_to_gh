The upgrade to Pynac 0.7.26 #28412 resolves the following issues with hashes in `SR` . This ticket adds a doctest for this.

This fails with Python 2 and 3:

```
sage: hash(-1/3) == hash(SR(-1/3))
False
```

This only fails with Python 3:

```
sage: hash(2^64-1) == hash(SR(2^64-1))
False
```

Here is a tentative patch I would like to get tested. The implementation is taken directly from `sage.libs.gmp.pylong.mpz_pythonhash`. The only difference is in how the final mapping from `-1` to `-2` is applied. It is important that `_mpq_pythonhash` obtains the hash values for numerator and denominator before this mapping is applied, as that is what happens in Sage.
