The upgrade to Pynac 0.7.26 #28412 resolves the following issues with hashes in `SR` . This ticket adds a doctest for this.

This fails with Python 2 and 3:

```
sage: hash(-1/3) == hash(SR(-1/3))
False
```

This only fails with Python 3:

```
sage: hash(2^64-1) == hash(SR(2^64-1))
False
```


Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
