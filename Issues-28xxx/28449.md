The following code, taken from the examples in `root_lattice_realizations.py`, produces a plot with messed up labels, which contain raw latex code blocks

```
sage: L = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: L.plot_crystal(C)
```

Found when testing matplotlib 3, which gives a warning here due to bounding box overflow

So the problem comes from the fact that the tableaux are not able to be rendered properly. This is an issue on the notebooks. Try the following the Jupyter notebook:

```
T = SemistandardTableau([[1,2],[3]])
%display latex
T
```
I don't know what part of the latex code it doesn't like, but I imagine the issues are linked. At least, I don't think the latex output has anything particular special...

There are two bugs to fix.  Both are easy. (Well, the second is easy in principle, but some thought/discussion may be required to decide when and where to apply the fix. And I think documentation will be needed.)
1. Matplotlib processes each line of the label individually, but the entire label needs to be processed as a single unit, if Latex is being used. (If you want a line break in a Latex label, use `\\`.) Here is a patch to fix this. Perhaps it should be sent upstream.

```diff
--- a/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/text.py
+++ b/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/text.py
-        lines = self.get_text().split("\n")  # Ensures lines is not empty.
+        if self.get_usetex():
+            lines = [self.get_text()] # long Latex labels need to be processed as a single line (see :trac:`28449`)
+        else:
+            lines = self.get_text().split("\n")  # Ensures lines is not empty.
```

2. Latex processing of matplotlib labels is turned off by default. It can be turned on by using `matplotlib.rc('text', usetex=True)`, so, after applying the above patch, the following code gives the correct picture (for me, at least).

```
sage: from matplotlib import rc
sage: rc('text', usetex=True)
sage: L = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: L.plot_crystal(C)
```

Unfortunately, I don't think we should make `usetex=True` the default, for two reasons: I don't think sage requires Latex to be installed, and Latex is slower than matplotlib's built-in math renderer. 

It seems to me that if a function (such as `plot_crystal`) expects Latex to process its labels, then it should set `usetex=True` (and restore its original value afterward). If that is not possible (because Latex is not available), then it should print a warning and/or do something else that is reasonable.

PS if you are interested: I think the reason that the raw Latex code shows up in the current version of `plot_crystal` is that each individual line is determined not to be valid math (because the number of dollar signs is not a nonzero even number), so it is processed as plain text, dollar signs and all.

I agree with this. For the last part, I would suggest printing a warning but still letting it go through as plain text.

So what you're saying is that if the result was completely contained in one line with no line breks, it would render as latex code, correct?

That is correct if `usetex` has been set to `True`. Otherwise, the matplotlib math parser will try to render the label, but it will fail with errors because it does not understand `\def` or `\begin` or a lot of other stuff. ([This web page](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/text/mathtext.html) has a list of symbols that the matplotlib parser understands, and I think any other TeX macro will give an error in math mode.) Eg:

```
sage: from matplotlib import rc
sage: rc('text', usetex=False)
sage: text(r"$\begin{array} 0 & 1 \end{array}$", (0,0))
/Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:592: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: 
\begin{array} 0 & 1 \end{array}
^
Unknown symbol: \begin (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)

After further thought, I think both of my suggestions in [comment:9](#comment%3A9) need major revision.
1. I think my patch is a bad idea. Instead, I suggest patching `plot_crystal` to make it put all of the latex code on one line. (This should be easy.) Although I personally would prefer matplotlib to use `\\` for line breaks, instead of `\n`, I don't think there is any hope of getting this backward-incompatible change approved.
