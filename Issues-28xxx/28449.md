```
The following code, taken from the examples in `root_lattice_realizations.py`, produces a plot with messed up labels, which contain raw latex code blocks

```
sage: L = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: L.plot_crystal(C)
```

Found when testing matplotlib 3, which gives a warning here due to bounding box overflow

There are two bugs to fix.  Both are easy. (Well, the second is easy in principle, but some thought/discussion may be required to decide when and where to apply the fix. And I think documentation will be needed.)
1. Matplotlib processes each line of the label individually, but the entire label needs to be processed as a single unit, if Latex is being used. (If you want a line break in a Latex label, use `\\`.) Here is a patch to fix this. Perhaps it should be sent upstream.

```diff
--- a/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/text.py
+++ b/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/text.py
-        lines = self.get_text().split("\n")  # Ensures lines is not empty.
+        if self.get_usetex():
+            lines = [self.get_text()] # long Latex labels need to be processed as a single line (see :trac:`28449`)
+        else:
+            lines = self.get_text().split("\n")  # Ensures lines is not empty.
```

2. Latex processing of matplotlib labels is turned off by default. It can be turned on by using `matplotlib.rc('text', usetex=True)`, so, after applying the above patch, the following code gives the correct picture (for me, at least).

```
sage: from matplotlib import rc
sage: rc('text', usetex=True)
sage: L = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: L.plot_crystal(C)
```

Unfortunately, I don't think we should make `usetex=True` the default, for two reasons: I don't think sage requires Latex to be installed, and Latex is slower than matplotlib's built-in math renderer. 

It seems to me that if a function (such as `plot_crystal`) expects Latex to process its labels, then it should set `usetex=True` (and restore its original value afterward). If that is not possible (because Latex is not available), then it should print a warning and/or do something else that is reasonable.

PS if you are interested: I think the reason that the raw Latex code shows up in the current version of `plot_crystal` is that each individual line is determined not to be valid math (because the number of dollar signs is not a nonzero even number), so it is processed as plain text, dollar signs and all.

+1 to sending it upstream.

I agree with this. For the last part, I would suggest printing a warning but still letting it go through as plain text.

So what you're saying is that if the result was completely contained in one line with no line breks, it would render as latex code, correct?

For the last part, I would suggest printing a warning but still letting it go through as plain text. \n\nYour suggestion sounds good to me, and I don't think it will be difficult to implement (if there is an easy way to detect the absence of Latex). To print the Latex code as plain text, it should suffice to escape the dollar signs, so the matplotlab parser doesn't realize there is any math.\n\n> So what you're saying is that if the result was completely contained in one line with no line breks, it would render as latex code, correct?\n\nThat is correct if `usetex` has been set to `True`.

Your suggestion sounds good to me, and I don't think it will be difficult to implement (if there is an easy way to detect the absence of Latex). To print the Latex code as plain text, it should suffice to escape the dollar signs, so the matplotlab parser doesn't realize there is any math.

> So what you're saying is that if the result was completely contained in one line with no line breks, it would render as latex code, correct?

That is correct if `usetex` has been set to `True`. Otherwise, the matplotlib math parser will try to render the label, but it will fail with errors because it does not understand `\def` or `\begin` or a lot of other stuff. ([This web page](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/text/mathtext.html) has a list of symbols that the matplotlib parser understands, and I think any other TeX macro will give an error in math mode.) Eg:

```
sage: from matplotlib import rc
sage: rc('text', usetex=False)
sage: text(r"$\begin{array} 0 & 1 \end{array}$", (0,0))
/Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:592: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: 
\begin{array} 0 & 1 \end{array}
^
Unknown symbol: \begin (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
  RichReprWarning,
Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
