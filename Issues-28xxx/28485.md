<a id='comment:59'></a>I made a series of comments on gitlab (nothing very important).

Moreover, I would suggest to add the keyword `absolute` to the constructor `GF` (`GF(27, absolute=False)` would return the relative extension `GF(27)` over `GF(3)`) and to the method `frobenius_endomorphism` which currently always returns the absolute Frobenius.
