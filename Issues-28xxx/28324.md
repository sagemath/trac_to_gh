In SageMath 8.7:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^4 + x^2 - 3
sage: L.<a> = f.splitting_field()
sage: G = L.galois_group()
sage: D4 = DihedralGroup(4)
sage: h = D4.isomorphism_to(G)
sage: h.image(D4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: subgroup() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gap_group'

sage: r, s = D4.gens()
sage: h.image(r)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: subgroup() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gap_group'
```

Fixed by #31489.

This was fixed, presumably by #31489. Related ticket: #30685.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
....: f = x^4 + x^2 - 3
....: L.<a> = f.splitting_field()
....: G = L.galois_group()
....: D4 = DihedralGroup(4)
....: h = D4.isomorphism_to(G)
....: h.image(D4)
Subgroup generated by [(1,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8), (1,7,4,6)(2,8,3,5)] of (Galois group 8T4 ([4]2) with order 8 of x^8 + 4*x^7 + 12*x^6 + 22*x^5 + 23*x^4 + 14*x^3 + 28*x^2 + 24*x + 16)
sage: r, s = D4.gens()
....: h.image(r)
(1,7,4,6)(2,8,3,5)
```
So I think we should close this as a duplicate.
