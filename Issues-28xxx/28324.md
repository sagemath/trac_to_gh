In SageMath 8.7:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^4 + x^2 - 3
sage: L.<a> = f.splitting_field()
sage: G = L.galois_group()
sage: D4 = DihedralGroup(4)
sage: h = D4.isomorphism_to(G)
sage: h.image(D4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: subgroup() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gap_group'

sage: r, s = D4.gens()
sage: h.image(r)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: subgroup() got an unexpected keyword argument 'gap_group'
```

Fixed by #31489.
