Initially appear in #27958. The following shows the difference between (certified) numerical integration using arb and symbolic integration followed by real ball evaluation. There is already an error on the 7th digit which shows that there is something very wrong.

```
sage: f = integral(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='sympy')
sage: f
1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
sage: prec = 128
sage: R = RealBallField(prec)
sage: C = ComplexBallField(prec)
sage: a = 5; b = 6
sage: C.integral(lambda x,_: (-x*x).exp()*x.log(), a, b)
[2.21866269568217921271433463e-12 +/- 2.99e-39]
sage: R(f.subs(x=b)) - R(f.subs(x=a))
[2.2186641328845716165938996e-12 +/- 9.28e-38]
```
Note that both quantites persist in being different with more precision required

```
sage: prec = 2096
sage: R = RealBallField(prec)
sage: C = ComplexBallField(prec)
sage: C.integral(lambda x,_: (-x*x).exp()*x.log(), a, b)
[2.218662695682...e-12  +/- 6.58e-641]
sage: R(f.subs(x=b)) - R(f.subs(x=a))
[2.218664132884...e-12 +/- 6.50e-630]
```
And also that arb is perfectly able to evaluate `erf` and `hypergeometric` correctly

```

Yes, maybe. It's about the "unreliable evaluation" part of the problem; I agree that it's better if it works instead of raising an error (but real balls should eventually get an erf() method of their own...)
