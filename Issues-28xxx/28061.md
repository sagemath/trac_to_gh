Note that both quantites persist in being different with more precision required

Yes, maybe. It's about the "unreliable evaluation" part of the problem; I agree that it's better if it works instead of raising an error (but real balls should eventually get an erf() method of their own...)

Either this ticket didn't in fact fix the issue, or it reappeared since::

```
sage: ref = ComplexBallField(200)(5).erf().real()
sage: ref

```
Do you remember if you checked the actual enclosure?

More about that shortly at #28517.
