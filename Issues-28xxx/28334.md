I installed a Debian virtual machine, and now I can see this error.

This problem does not seem related to the particular doctest: if I remove lots of other doctests from that file but keep this one, the error goes away. If I instead keep the file intact and add some print statements, the error is printed as this line is executed:

```
return PermutationGroup(H)
```
`PermutationGroup` has nothing to do with flint, I think.

Any ideas how to debug this?

On the other hand, I've tried increasing the default `memlimit` in `bin/sage-runtests`, with no effect.

Well, actually it is reported as failed in
https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-54-generic/petitbonum/2019-09-03%2009:06:17?short

Is this the "reference patchbot" for Python 3 Sage? If yes, then the table of #28298 must be updated.

The FLINT repo is active, and has
[a roadmap for FLINT 2.6.0](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/517),
itself part of
[the Oscar roadmap](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl/issues/1),
so there are reasons to hope.
