I installed a Debian virtual machine, and now I can see this error.

This problem does not seem related to the particular doctest: if I remove lots of other doctests from that file but keep this one, the error goes away. If I instead keep the file intact and add some print statements, the error is printed as this line is executed:

```
return PermutationGroup(H)
```
`PermutationGroup` has nothing to do with flint, I think.

Any ideas how to debug this?

On the other hand, I've tried increasing the default `memlimit` in `bin/sage-runtests`, with no effect.

Well, actually it is reported as failed in
https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-54-generic/petitbonum/2019-09-03%2009:06:17?short

Is this the "reference patchbot" for Python 3 Sage? If yes, then the table of #28298 must be updated.

Okay, I think I know what's going on. This is the same problem as in #28454: strings are being sent to stdout by a C or C++ library but the output is not flushed, or whether it's flushed is system/OS-dependent, so messages like "Exception (FLINT memory_manager). Unable to allocate memory." do not get printed when we expect them, but rather some time later. In this particular case, the message should be printed when this doctest is run:

```
        FLINT memory errors do not crash Sage (:trac:`17629`)::

            sage: t^(sys.maxsize//2)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: FLINT exception
```
in which case it's captured by the "...". But on some platforms, with Python 3 only, the message is not printed at the right time. (I don't know why, but this really does seem to be what's going on.)

One solution would be to modify FLINT to flush the output. Is there a pure Python 3 solution, which we can incorporate in the Sage library without patching or modifying FLINT?

Having said that, here is a patch for FLINT. This fixes the problem for me. I won't mark as "needs review" yet, since I would like to know if there is a fix for this on the !Sage/Python side first. If that looks possible but complicated, we can use this patch as a stopgap.

The FLINT repo is active, and has
[a roadmap for FLINT 2.6.0](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/517),
itself part of
[the Oscar roadmap](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl/issues/1),
so there are reasons to hope.
