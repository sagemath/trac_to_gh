In order to be more meaningful, the name of the attribute `_H` of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is changed to `_facet_names`. Likewise the corresponding method is renamed.

Also `V` is renamed `Vrep`.

Note that in #28608 we change the abbreviation from `Vrepr` to `Vrep`.

In `CombinatorialFace` we alter this change to `ambient_Vrep` and `ambient_facets`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I'm starting to doubt that `_ambient_Vrep` in `CombinatorialFace` is a good name for the `Vrepresentation` names of the polyhedron.

We will have `ambient_Vrepresentation` correspond to the elements of the `Vrepresentation` that define the face.

Then again in `PolyhedronFace` its `ambient_dim` for the dimension of the polyhedron?

Anyway, I don't think it's a good choice to have `_ambient_Vrep` and `ambient_Vrepresentation` mean two different things. What would be a good alternative for `_ambient_Vrep`?
