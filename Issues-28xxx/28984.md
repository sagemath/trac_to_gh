Currently sage's and sage's dependency C++ code is compiled with -std=c++11 unless overridden. This is autoconf macro's fault. So it won't be visible inside vanilla sage for the time being. But it is very important on distros. Also we should note that singular has a copy of "libgfan" based on the same code.

Has upstream been contacted?
