Currently starting SageNB fails with `"ImportError: cannot import name 'smtp' from 'twisted.mail'`. Add some nice message instead of that, like "SageNB has been removed starting from [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 9.0."

Yes, my bad. Corrected.

About special message: maybe not worth it. We can just hard-code this to the code. Or at least remove the function and command line parameter.

Under Python 2, both `./sage -n sagenb` and `notebook()` result in

```
ImportError: No module named sagenb.notebook.notebook_object
```

---

With Python 3 and without sagenb, `./sage -n sagenb` gives

```
CRITICAL:root:trying to use old notebook under Python 3
old notebook not working under Python 3, use Jupyter notebook
see https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch
```
whereas `notebook()` produces

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sagenb.notebook'
```

If sagenb is installed under Python 3, with `notebook()` we get

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'smtp' from 'twisted.mail' (unknown location)
```

These messages seem fine, except for the last one. Though, considering that sagenb does not get installed anymore now that Python 3 is the default, this does not look like a big problem.

Agreed.

I do wonder whether `notebook()` should launch Jupyter, but maybe that is not technically feasible?  I feel like we discussed this a few years back.
