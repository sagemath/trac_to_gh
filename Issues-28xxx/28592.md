FWIW, one way to compute sin/cos without code for solving ODEs of order two is via 1/(1+t²) → arctan → tan → tan²/2.

I have a question about this. There is the class function `shift(self, n)` that is supposed to do the same thing as `self[n:]` (when `n` is positive). However, the shift is very often not optimized and goes through lists and calling the parent. Is there a prefered way (for readability/uniformity of the code)?

> * I'm not sure if testing the characteristic instead of just letting the code fail with a division by zero is actually a good idea, because there may be applications where one wants to compute truncated series to a precision < characteristic. But that's a really minor detail, and largely a matter of taste.



Fine. It will make the code faster :-)

This gives you arctan and tan. But how do you extract cos/sin from there?

Performance is to me the main motivation

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: %timeit f = (1 + x - 2*x^2 + 3*x^3).O(100).log(100)
1000 loops, best of 5: 1.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit f = (1 + x - 2*x^2 + 3*x^3).O(1000).log(1000)
100 loops, best of 5: 12.1 ms per loop
```
versus

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: %timeit f = (1 + x - 2*x^2 + 3*x^3)._log_series(100)
10000 loops, best of 5: 57.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f = (1 + x - 2*x^2 + 3*x^3)._log_series(1000)
100 loops, best of 5: 7.97 ms per loop
```
(not excessively impressive though)

I opened #28612 to rewrite the implementation of `.log()`/`.exp()` on power series to call the `._log_series()`/`._exp_series()` of the underlying polynomial.
