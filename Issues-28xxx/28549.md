This ticket is to inform you about how to build sage with the Windows Subsystem for Linux and to provide the necessary changes to make this work. Since this is my first contribution to sage, please let me know if I've overseen something obvious and please be lenient in case I broke some written or unwritten rules.

# Steps to build sage on WSL
including set-up git infrastructure since this is partly different on Windows as well.

## Prerequisites
* [Install WSL (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Git (run everything in git bash)
* Clone repository
* Correct line endings (necessary if global core.autocrlf is set to true):

  ```
  git config --local core.autocrlf false 
  git rm --cached -r .
  git reset --hard
```
* Setup remote trac (nessary if you want to contribute)
  
  Follow the instructions to set-up the ssh key https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases and then follow http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#trac-authentication-through-ssh and http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html#chapter-manual-git

```
git remote add trac git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git -t master
git remote set-url --push trac git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
```
* Switch to development branch

  ```
  git checkout develop
```

## Build sage (run everything from Ubuntu bash)
* Install prerequisites 
  This is a slightly extended version of the [corresponding script for Linux](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-recommended-installation).

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   
   sudo apt-get install binutils pixz gcc g++ gfortran make m4 perl tar git patch openssl libssl-dev libz-dev bc libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libgmp-dev libffi-dev libgf2x-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl yasm
   sudo apt-get install gettext libgettextpo-dev
   sudo apt-get install automake pkgconf
```
* Change into sage folder
* Set how many cores you want to use for building (important, otherwise it will take ages)

  ```
  export MAKE="make -j4"
```

* Build (there will be errors on the way, so ignore them using the `-k` switch)

  ``` 
  make -k
```
* Test sage

  ```
  ./sage
  2+2
```


# Changes necessary to make this work
In order to make the above procedure work, I had to change a few things on the way. I have pushed these changes to the branch `public/wls`.
* Linux symlinks do not work under Windows. Thus, if you clone the repository the symlinks are replaced by ordinary text files containing the target path of the symlink. To fix this, I replaced the symlinks in `build/pgks/gfortran/` by the respective files in `build/pgks/gcc` and similarily in `build/pgks/python2/` by the respective files in `build/pgks/python3/`. (There is probably a more elegant way to do this)
* Error

  ``` 
  spgk-install should not be marked executable in the build/pkgs directory
```
   was fixed by changing `build/bin/sage-spkg`. This is a quick hack and probably needs to be fixed properly. The trick used for cygwin does not work since `uname = Linux` when run from WSL.
* Error 

  ```
  OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: './src/doc/pari/Programming_in_GP:_other_specific_functions.html'
  open sage/upstream/giac-X.tar.bz2
```
   was fixed by changes in `tar_file.py`. This is also a quick hack and needs a better fix, e.g. rename the file to a valid name?
* Error

  ```
  The headers or library files could not be found for zlib,
  a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.
  
  Please see the install instructions at:
     https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
```
   was fixed by deactivating `zlib` in `pillow/spkg-install`. Note sure if this has any negative side effects.

# Remaining issues
With the above changes, the `make` build works in principle. There are a few small issues that needs further improvement.
* Creating the documentation during `make` or by `./sage --docbuild all html` fails with the errors of the form

  ```
   OSError: WARNING: Unable to fetch /mnt/c/sage/local/share/doc/sage/doctrees/en/reference/algebras/environment.pickle
  There is a syntax error in your configuration file: invalid syntax (conf.py, line 1)
  Build finished. The built documents can be found in /mnt/c/sage/local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/algebras
```
   I guess, the problem is that `conf.py` in `src\doc\en\reference\algebras` is a symbolic link.
* At startup of sage, you get the warning

  ```
  /mnt/c/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/psutil/_pslinux.py:519: RuntimeWarning: 'sin' and 'sout' swap memory stats couldn't be determined and were set to 0 ([Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/proc/vmstat')
    warnings.warn(msg, RuntimeWarning)
```
  Probably, there is nothing we can do, since this is a known limitation of WSL: https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1071

It's for WSL 1. As far as I know, WSL 2 is still in preview (or at least requires a insiders build of Windows).

The problem with the symbolic links could have been caused by the fact that I cloned the repository under Windows, which replaced the symbolic links with text files. It might work if you clone under WSL.

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment%3A5): 
> The problem with the symbolic links could have been caused by the fact that I cloned the repository under Windows, which replaced the symbolic links with text files. It might work if you clone under WSL.

Indeed, I think any build process for Sage on WSL should be 100% under WSL.  This is likely also the cause of some of the permission problems you noted.

apologies, this reflects the number of active contibutors to "core" Sage who use WSL (or Windows in general), unfortunately.

At least now we have started to test on Windows using [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) Actions, so if we managed this with WSL too we would be in a good shape here.

Thanks for the feedback.

I think checking out the code under Windows should be supported. I want to develop under Windows using my normal tool set, and only run the compilation under Linux. Although the file system support of WSL got better over time, transferring or accessing files that are in the Linux system from Windows is still an hassle.

That might work.

Needless to say, running the result of the compilation, debugging, etc. will also happen on WSL.
It seems that at best we talk about editing the sources and using git on Windows
in such a setup.

Well, as a first step, would you like to help document what already works for our upcoming 9.1 release?

Changing the Sage build so it works with non-Unix lineendings and restructuring the build so that no symlinks are in the source repository [obviously, not by making copies...] is more work, which won't be ready for the 9.1 release, but would be a valuable contribution.

         self.__md5 = result.get('md5', None)
         self.__sha1 = result.get('sha1', None)
         self.__cksum = result.get('cksum', None)
-        self.__tarball_pattern = result['tarball']
+        self.__tarball_pattern = result.get('tarball', "")
         # Name of the directory containing the checksums.ini file
         self.__tarball_package_name = os.path.realpath(checksums_ini).split(os.sep)[-2]
+        if not result.get('tarball'):
+            log.warn("Could not find checksum in %s" % checksums_ini)
```

This can be written just `result.get('tarball')`, without specifying a default.  In this case the default is already `None`.  Then below you can write `if not self.__tarball_pattern:`.

Out of curiosity though why would this happen?  Shouldn't this always be here?  And why an explicit check for `'tarball'` and not for the other required fields?

This check is overly broad since this will work on any POSIX system (and should work on WSL too but I understand it's presently a limitation with the NTFS filesystem).

Instead perhaps it should try extracting the file anyways but properly handle whatever exception occurs when trying to extract it on WSL, and produce a warning as well.
