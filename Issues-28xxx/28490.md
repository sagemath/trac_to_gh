```
sage: 100_000_

Also, perhaps could you show the feature in action with a concrete example, something like:

```
The preparser can handle PEP 515 (see :trac:`28490`)::

    sage: 1_000_000 + 3_000

- use `# py2` and `# py3` in doctests to make patchbots happy.

5 months ago, when the ticket was opened, Python 2 was the default for Sage, and all of these things were completely broken with Python 2. Should this ticket provide support for Python 2? I haven't looked at your changes, so I don't know if they do.

It's not a request anymore, it's been merged into Python. Whose role is it to make sure that valid Python 3 syntax, like `100_000.0`, is interpreted properly in Sage?

Python 2 is supposed to be dropped in sage-9.2. It should be supported for the next 9.1 release.

It **does** work with Python2 as the above `SyntaxError` is the expected behavior

```
$ python2 -c '123_456'

    123_456
          ^

I don't see why we would change that in Sage.

Nice! To my mind, this is the end. `RealNumber` should accept this kind of strings as `float` does.

```
sage: float('1_1.1_1e1_1')
1111000000000.0
```
It is not the job of the preparser to modify the input string.

Which is precisely what I don't wnat to do here!

Why not? This is in the `__init__` method for `RealNumber`, where the string is already modified, as you can see from the surrounding lines. It's not in the preparser. Where else would you want to fix it?
