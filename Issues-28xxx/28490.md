In my understanding of the PEP (confirmed by testing on a ipython3 console), trailing underscores are not allowed, however we currently have:

```
sage: 100_000_
100000
```

Also, perhaps could you show the feature in action with a concrete example, something like:

```
The preparser can handle PEP 515 (see :trac:`28490`)::

    sage: 1_000_000 + 3_000
    1003000
```

My personal opinion:

- write a simple code with Python 3 in mind only, to avoid cumbersome code, since Python2 will be dropped soon anyway (an i guess nobody using Python 2 will complain that 1000_000 should not be accepted)
- use `# py2` and `# py3` in doctests to make patchbots happy.

Couldn't you simply change `dec_num` to something like `dec_num = r"\d+(_\d+)*"` ?

5 months ago, when the ticket was opened, Python 2 was the default for Sage, and all of these things were completely broken with Python 2. Should this ticket provide support for Python 2? I haven't looked at your changes, so I don't know if they do.

It's not a request anymore, it's been merged into Python. Whose role is it to make sure that valid Python 3 syntax, like `100_000.0`, is interpreted properly in Sage?

Python 2 is supposed to be dropped in sage-9.2. It should be supported for the next 9.1 release.

I looked at your branch. It doesn't work with Python 2, for what that's worth:

```

I also get a few doctest failures with Python 3, but they should be easy to fix.

You can delete `dec_num` since it is redundant.

It **does** work with Python2 as the above `SyntaxError` is the expected behavior

```
$ python2 -c '123_456'

    123_456
          ^

Nice! To my mind, this is the end. `RealNumber` should accept this kind of strings as `float` does.

```
sage: float('1_1.1_1e1_1')
1111000000000.0

It is not the job of the preparser to modify the input string.
