- write a simple code with Python 3 in mind only, to avoid cumbersome code, since Python2 will be dropped soon anyway (an i guess nobody using Python 2 will complain that 1000_000 should not be accepted)
- use `# py2` and `# py3` in doctests to make patchbots happy.

<a id='comment:14'></a>That's mostly what I did, except that with my code and Sage + Python 2, leading zeroes are still allowed. Aside from the `# py2` and `# py3` doctest tags, the only thing I've added to support Python 2 is to insert `if (six.PY3 and ...)` instead of `if (...)`. (This is to deal with leading zeroes.)

5 months ago, when the ticket was opened, Python 2 was the default for Sage, and all of these things were completely broken with Python 2. Should this ticket provide support for Python 2? I haven't looked at your changes, so I don't know if they do.

It's not a request anymore, it's been merged into Python. Whose role is it to make sure that valid Python 3 syntax, like `100_000.0`, is interpreted properly in Sage?

Python 2 is supposed to be dropped in sage-9.2. It should be supported for the next 9.1 release.

You can delete `dec_num` since it is redundant.

It **does** work with Python2 as the above `SyntaxError` is the expected behavior

```
$ python2 -c '123_456'
  File "<string>", line 1
    123_456
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
I don't see why we would change that in Sage.

Nice! To my mind, this is the end. `RealNumber` should accept this kind of strings as `float` does.

```
sage: float('1_1.1_1e1_1')
1111000000000.0
```
It is not the job of the preparser to modify the input string.

It is not nice I agree. But I do not quite see inconsistency. Some constructors (like `Integer.__init__`) can perfectly support additional syntax. The problem to me is that on Python2, `1_3.` does not raise an error. But I do not want to worry about Python2. If you find a non invasive solution, feel free to add to the branch.

Related comment: it would be interesting to benchmark the two options for the preparser `123 -> Integer(123)` to `123 -> Integer('123')`. See the noticeable slowdown mentioned in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Pc1qgjd_SzQ).
