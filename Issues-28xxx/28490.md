In my understanding of the PEP (confirmed by testing on a ipython3 console), trailing underscores are not allowed, however we currently have:

```
sage: 100_000_
100000
```

Also, perhaps could you show the feature in action with a concrete example, something like:

```
The preparser can handle PEP 515 (see :trac:`28490`)::

    sage: 1_000_000 + 3_000
    1003000
```

The doctests pass with Python 3, not with Python 2. I guess there is a question: using underscores is only valid starting in Python. Do we want to allow this in Sage built with Python 2?

Also, a leading zero is valid in Python 2 but not in Python 3. What should we do about that?

My personal opinion:

- write a simple code with Python 3 in mind only, to avoid cumbersome code, since Python2 will be dropped soon anyway (an i guess nobody using Python 2 will complain that 1000_000 should not be accepted)
- use `# py2` and `# py3` in doctests to make patchbots happy.

The only problem seems to be that `.0` is too often converted to `.gen(0)`

It's not a request anymore, it's been merged into Python. Whose role is it to make sure that valid Python 3 syntax, like `100_000.0`, is interpreted properly in Sage?

Python 2 is supposed to be dropped in sage-9.2. It should be supported for the next 9.1 release.

Agreed. Did you have a look at `public/28490`? It does not touch to the interpreter beyond the update of regexp.

I looked at your branch. It doesn't work with Python 2, for what that's worth:

```
sage: 123_456
  File "<ipython-input-1-d4d70e3ee054>", line 1
    Integer(123_456)

```
I also get a few doctest failures with Python 3, but they should be easy to fix.

You can delete `dec_num` since it is redundant.

It **does** work with Python2 as the above `SyntaxError` is the expected behavior

```
$ python2 -c '123_456'
  File "<string>", line 1
    123_456
          ^

I don't see why we would change that in Sage.

Nice! To my mind, this is the end. `RealNumber` should accept this kind of strings as `float` does.

```
sage: float('1_1.1_1e1_1')
1111000000000.0

It is not the job of the preparser to modify the input string.
