Currently sage flattens the threejs directory structure. It still needs to take the actual structure into account when using threejs from a CDN though.

I don't see a reason to flatten the structure. It should be easier for distributions (certainly is for nixos) to keep the structure.

I have only tested this with the nix package, since it is a pain to get the sage build system working on nixos. Would appreciate it if someone else could test the `build/` changes (simple `make ptestlong`).

What are you installing in nix to find it a burden to change the structure? Because it didn't appear that we are using an upstream tarball I just used sage's one in sage-on-gentoo. Admittedly, I call the package `threejs-sage-extension` and it is installed in a sage related location rather then something more generic.

I am curious of your install procedure and if it make sense for me to follow suite.

Yes, but there is value in standardizing the directory structure. While sage only packages threejs for a single purpose, distributions usually have multiple consumers in mind. If every package expects the threejs files in a different place, everyones lives are harder.

I don't really see much of a complication here. Since it makes the `offline` code closer to the one that fetches from the CDN, it may even simplify in the future. But in any case, I don't see any complication for sage.

> Yes, but there is value in standardizing the directory structure. While sage only packages threejs for a single purpose, distributions usually have multiple consumers in mind. If every package expects the threejs files in a different place, everyones lives are harder.

Then I guess I don’t have an objection, but would like other packagers to chime in.
