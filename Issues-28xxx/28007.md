Currently sage flattens the threejs directory structure. It still needs to take the actual structure into account when using threejs from a CDN though.

I don't see a reason to flatten the structure. It should be easier for distributions (certainly is for nixos) to keep the structure.

I have only tested this with the nix package, since it is a pain to get the sage build system working on nixos. Would appreciate it if someone else could test the `build/` changes (simple `make ptestlong`).

What are you installing in nix to find it a burden to change the structure? Because it didn't appear that we are using an upstream tarball I just used sage's one in sage-on-gentoo. Admittedly, I call the package `threejs-sage-extension` and it is installed in a sage related location rather then something more generic.

I am curious of your install procedure and if it make sense for me to follow suite.

Right, somehow failed to push that.

Why is that a challenge? Can't I just add `.p1` to the version? In any case, I also added an update.

In the context of Three.js this is a bad idea. Upgrades are very often not backward compatible. An upgrade of Three.js should always happen on a separate ticket to be sure the template I wrote still works properly with the new version. Believe me, there were definite issues the last time I did an upgrade. Unless you use Three.js on a regular basis and are certain nothing is broken, please remove this upgrade.

Yes, but there is value in standardizing the directory structure. While sage only packages threejs for a single purpose, distributions usually have multiple consumers in mind. If every package expects the threejs files in a different place, everyones lives are harder.

I don't really see much of a complication here. Since it makes the `offline` code closer to the one that fetches from the CDN, it may even simplify in the future. But in any case, I don't see any complication for sage.

Because pkg-$version and pkg-$version.p$number are supposed to have the same tarball in sage's package management system. Which is a problem when the online package repo has to hold tarballs for several versions of sage, see http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sage/spkg/upstream/threejs/index.html for a relevant example. This is where patchbot gets their packages by the way.
