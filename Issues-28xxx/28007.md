Keywords: days99, IMA Coding Sprint

Create classes for the different symmetry classes of plane partitions (Cyclically symmetric, Totally Symmetric, etc.), along with methods taking elements in these symmetry classes to an object in a fundamental domain (usually an order ideal in some associated poset). 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28244

Current things to work on:

* I changed `all.py` from being a lazy import to a regular import because I thought it might have been keeping something from working. That change will very likely be reverted once I get a chance to confirm that I was wrong.


* Some of the poset/comparison structures at the beginning of various iterators can be streamlined or replaced with existing code (ie, `posets.ProductOfChains` is a thing, that code doesn't need to be duplicated).

* Iterator code currently saves all the generated objects to a list, sorts the list, and then goes through them one at a time. Instead of adding a generated object to a list, it should just be yielded at that point, and the very last part of each iterator that iterates over the generated list can be removed.

* Commented out existing code for iterating over plane partitions in a box using the SemistandardTableaux iterator with the code iterating over the my using antichain iterator on product of chains poset. Once the new code is cleaned up, the two should be compared.

* Documentation and doc-tests are currently minimal/missing.

* Additional methods need to be added to the various classes giving maps to order ideals in the various fundamental domains.

* Would the various fundamental domains be something that we would really want added to the posets catalog ( http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.html )?

Main outstanding issues:

- Things with the same underlying plane partition are not being recognized as equal. In particular, for the following examples we want `a == b` and `b == c`, but not `a is b` nor `b is c`.

```python 
a = PlanePartitions()([[2,1],[1]])
b = PlanePartitions([2,2,2])([[2,1],[1]])
c = PlanePartitions(3)([[2,1],[1]])
```

From looking at `partitions.py`, I can see that it shouldn't be necessary to set up some kind of explicit `__equals__` method. But just having `Element = PlanePartition` at the end of the parent classes doesn't seem to be working.

- For the symmetry classes whose elements are in bijection with order ideals in an associated poset, the methods that generate this associated poset and take order ideals/antichains in this poset to plane partitions are not documented.

- Need to make some `__contains__` methods for the various symmetry classes

- Planning on pushing code for going to/from monomial ideals to a later ticket, along with methods that would take a plane partition in a symmetry class and map it to and order ideal/antichain in the associated poset (we currently only go from poset to plane partition).

I think the only thing left to do before review (that I am capable of doing on my own) is finishing up the documentation for possible inputs for `PlanePartitions`, likely with symlinks to the different symmetry classes.

Jessica, you can start looking over things when you get a chance. The one thing I wanted to note is that I have the method `to_order_ideal()` for a regular plane partition commented out, because without some kind of order ideal class to wrap around the result in, it's really just giving the same output as `cells()`.

Travis, I'm having issues getting plane partitions that are the same element (but being constructed with different parents) as being recognized as equal.  I.e., for the following examples we want `a == b` and `b == c`, but not `a is b` nor `b is c`.

```python 
a = PlanePartitions()([[2,1],[1]])
b = PlanePartitions([2,2,2])([[2,1],[1]])
c = PlanePartitions(4)([[2,1],[1]])
```

I've been looking at `partitions.py` and `tableau.py` where this functionality works, but I can't see what they're doing that is missing here.

How `ClonableArray` rich comparison works is it rejects anything that cannot be coerced into the same parent (this is what the coercion system does in general by default). `Partition` and `Tableau` work differently and implement their own custom comparisons.

I can do the review Jessica.

Remove from `combinat/all.py`:

```
+#from .plane_partition import PlanePartition, PlanePartitions
+
```

We do not want `PlanePartition` to be mutable, so it should still inherit from `ClonableArray`.

You need to justify why you are removing the `box_size` optional input. If we do decide to remove it, it needs to be deprecated.

Following Python conventions, error messages should start with a lowercase letter.

In `contains()`:

```diff
-        for i in range(len(PP)):
-            if len(self[i]) < len(PP[i]):
-                return False
+        if any(len(self[i]) < len(PP[i]) for i in range(len(PP))):
+            return False
         
-        return all([self[i][j] >= PP[i][j] for j in range(len(PP[i])) for i in range(len(PP))])        
+        return all(self[i][j] >= val for i,row in enumerate(PP) for j, val in enumerate(row))
```

Remove the commented out code in `transpose()`.

Please be more consistent about the whitespace (specifically the blanklines). Also, more general PEP8 stuff like spacing around, e.g., comparison operators.

What does `maximal_boxes()` compute? This should be documented. These are the removable corners, right? I feel like there should be a direct way to compute them rather than going through the poset code.

In `cyclically_rotate`, the optional argument is not `preserve_parents`.

In `PlanePartitions`, the symmetry bullet points are over-indented.

`PlanePartitions.to_poset()` is a bad name because it does not convert anything to a poset. I would call it `underlying_poset` or something like this.

In `from_antichain`, `if A != []:` is better as `if not A:`.

I would put the `P_in_shape_iter` before `PP_first_row_iter` just because the latter calls the former, but not the other way around.

Your `PlanePartitions_XYZ` do not need `__classcall_private__`. You are better off normalizing the input (that is, making `box_size` a tuple) in `PlanePartitions.__classcall_private__` so it is done in one place.

Addressed a number of the comments.

In terms of removing `box_size` as an optional parameter for the element class, I think if a user wants to construct an element with a particular parent, then they should construct the parent and then use that to construct the element (i.e., they should do `PlanePartitions(box_size)(pp)` instead of `PlanePartition(pp, box_size)`. Otherwise, you would have to replicate all the messy code in the `PlanePartitions` factory for parsing possible `box_size` and `symmetry` inputs. I would prefer to go the deprecation route, unless there is some strong convention/reason to be able to pass parameters about a desired parent directly to the element constructor.

Maximal boxes are the removable ones. I can write a better/faster method that just scans the underlying array directly.

I'd argue that the `to_poset()` method is converting the set of plane partition in a box (with whatever symmetry) into the set (of order ideals of) the associated poset. But if it's generally accepted that methods starting with `to` convert objects into objects instead of sets of objects into sets of objects, then I can change it.

You don't have to duplicate this. You can just pass this along to the parent constructor. (From your argument, you could extend it slightly to say that a user should just construct the parent first.)

Thank you.

It is the general convention that `to_foo` should result in a `foo` being returned. I found the name of this method initially confusing because of this.

I think all of my comments were addressed, but I am not 100% certain from the commits. This will need a rebasing to the latest `develop` and any commented out code should be removed. Otherwise it should be good to go.
