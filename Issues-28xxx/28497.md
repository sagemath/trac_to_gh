Julian Rüth ([`@`saraedum](https://gitlab.com/saraedum)) opened a merge request at https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/merge_requests/34:

---

Mostly fixing docstring formatting by enclosing code snippets in double backticks
rather than simple ones.

This makes the corresponding snippets render in typewriter font rather than being latexed.

Also remove an extra word and restore double underscores in one method name.
