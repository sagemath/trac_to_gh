This ticket is part of a series of tickets to parallelize the f-vector for polyhedra.

Python classes may not be accessed in `nogil`. To access important attributes of the class `FaceIterator`, we move those attributes to a structure, which can be accessed in `nogil`.

Along the way, the ticket simplifies some doctests that define cython functions.
