The sage-env script has never been particularly useful in distributions, and has actually been more of a nuisance: it needs to be heavily patched or even replaced with a custom one. 

After #25786 (which removes SAGE_DOC_SRC usage at runtime) the only use for it that I can think of is setting DOT_SAGE. This patch allows to completely do away with this script, by setting a fallback for DOT_SAGE in the sage executable.

```
which may be harder to replace more generally.

I haven't made any fix to runtests, but `DOT_SAGE` should definitely be set - for some exotic usage with valgrind and other tools.

Certainly does look hackish. I would have never thought of using `print` that way. Does this really work?

The only remaining usages of SAGE_DOC_SRC in sagelib are in sage/doctest/control.py (which adds it to the list of tested dirs when calling sage -t -a) and sage/docs/conf.py (where AFAICS all usages besides the one fixed here are for doc build), so I don't expect more failures.

No. COPYING.txt should probably be installed somewhere in SAGE_SHARE. But given that this is currently broken for distros anyway, I'd say it's material for a different ticket.

Cool, that's a clean up that's almost done then.

Agreed. What to do with that file may be dependent on distro policies as well. It belongs to the location I set `SAGE_DOC` to, by policy in sage-on-gentoo.

This ticket is dealing with a good number of loose ends, it is quite nice.

    ImportError: No module named sage.env

```
The reason is that the `sage-cython` script begins

```/usr/bin/env python
```
That means that it uses Python 2 by default. With a Python 3 build, Python 2 doesn't know about the `sage` module.

I'm not sure what you should do instead. Maybe

```
try:
    from sage.env import SAGE_SRC
except ImportError:
    SAGE_SRC = (something involving SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_LIB?)
```
What variables are guaranteed to be set when `sage-cython` is run?

Either one or two: one for your followup issues, maybe a separate one to fix the doctest?
