The sage-env script has never been particularly useful in distributions, and has actually been more of a nuisance: it needs to be heavily patched or even replaced with a custom one. 

After #25786 (which removes SAGE_DOC_SRC usage at runtime) the only use for it that I can think of is setting DOT_SAGE. This patch allows to completely do away with this script, by setting a fallback for DOT_SAGE in the sage executable.

Depends on #25786

I have been `sage-env` free for a few releases now in sage-on-gentoo. I ship my own sage script now, but the change I see in the commit are good. I think you should also fix `sage-cython` https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-8.1-sage-cython.patch which won't work with stuff from the environment. I also have this patch for various scripts https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-bin-8.7.patch

I also have 

```
# Replace SAGE_EXTCODE with the installation location
	sed -i "s:\$SAGE_EXTCODE:${EPREFIX}/usr/share/sage/ext:g" \
		bin/sage-ipynb2rst \
		bin/sage-valgrind
```
which may be harder to replace more generally.

I haven't made any fix to runtests, but `DOT_SAGE` should definitely be set - for some exotic usage with valgrind and other tools.

Certainly does look hackish. I would have never thought of using `print` that way. Does this really work?

I missed the singularpath one because I deal with it in the same patch as I do adjustments to `env.py`. I neglected that. I don't have a problem with `SAGE_DOC_SRC` because I have it default to `SAGE_DOC`  not `SAGE_SRC/doc` in sage-on-gentoo. I am surprised that's the only place you had to fix. I am expecting anything calling `SAGE_DOC_SRC` at runtime to fail if left at that value.

I know there is no doctests in `sage/misc/copying.py` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/misc/copying.py) but I am wondering if you do anything about it.

The only remaining usages of SAGE_DOC_SRC in sagelib are in sage/doctest/control.py (which adds it to the list of tested dirs when calling sage -t -a) and sage/docs/conf.py (where AFAICS all usages besides the one fixed here are for doc build), so I don't expect more failures.

No. COPYING.txt should probably be installed somewhere in SAGE_SHARE. But given that this is currently broken for distros anyway, I'd say it's material for a different ticket.

Cool, that's a clean up that's almost done then.

Agreed. What to do with that file may be dependent on distro policies as well. It belongs to the location I set `SAGE_DOC` to, by policy in sage-on-gentoo.

This ticket is dealing with a good number of loose ends, it is quite nice.

Some version of this ticket was merged into 8.9.beta5, and I'm guessing the last commit didn't make it. In any case, the changes that were merged cause an error with Python 3:

```
sage -t --warn-long 78.7 src/sage/tests/cmdline.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 503, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    print(err)
Expected:
    Cython (http://cython.org) is a compiler for code written in the
    Cython language.  Cython is based on Pyrex by Greg Ewing.
    ...
Got:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.9.beta5/src/bin/sage-cython", line 12, in <module>
        from sage.env import SAGE_SRC
    ImportError: No module named sage.env
    <BLANKLINE>
```
The reason is that the `sage-cython` script begins

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
```
That means that it uses Python 2 by default. With a Python 3 build, Python 2 doesn't know about the `sage` module.

I'm not sure what you should do instead. Maybe

```
try:
    from sage.env import SAGE_SRC
except ImportError:
    SAGE_SRC = (something involving SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_LIB?)
```
What variables are guaranteed to be set when `sage-cython` is run?

I think `sage-cython` should use the python sage uses otherwise, what's the point? While I don't like it, I am guessing it should use `sage-python23` instead of plain `python`. I am open to contrary opinions.

We need a follow up ticket for that last commit that didn't make and a couple of things I spotted in `sage_setup` we can throw that in as well.

The only thing that script does is to check arguments and run `cython`, so it should run fine with the system Python. For distro use, do you even care about how SAGE_SRC is used here? Maybe you could have

```
try:
    SAGE_SRC = os.environ["SAGE_SRC"]
except ImportError:
    SAGE_SRC = "/does/not/exist"
```
plus some explanatory comments. The whole script is deprecated, so maybe it doesn't matter much what happens to it, but you might cc jdemeyer on the followup ticket.

Either one or two: one for your followup issues, maybe a separate one to fix the doctest?
