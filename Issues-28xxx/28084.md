there are 102 `REFERENCE(S):` tags in graphs/, so this is not too much work (which us a part of #27497)

One should also add DOI to all these, e.g. there is doi2bib on pypi, which can be used to generate all that stuff...

In this ticket we move around half of these references. The remaining references will be moved in #28443.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28084

The reference to CIA is now orphaned.

```
*Quelques proprietes topologiques des
+             graphes et applications a internet et aux reseaux*
```
is missing the accents, and should be

```

Otherwise, good to go. You can set to positive when fixed.
