there are 102 `REFERENCE(S):` tags in graphs/, so this is not too much work (which us a part of #27497)

One should also add DOI to all these, e.g. there is doi2bib on pypi, which can be used to generate all that stuff...

In this ticket we move around half of these references. The remaining references will be moved in #28443.
