Implemented a "new" algorithm for nth root in finite fields/rings (adapted from the paper "On taking roots in finite fields" by Adelman et al. 1977). My tests show similar or slightly better performance at small prime moduli and significantly better performance in many cases at large prime moduli. This performance increase is mainly due to not relying on K.multiplicative_generator() which needs to factor (p-1) and leads to erratic performance.

Apologies, I didn't realize `git trac create` forks from develop instead of the current branch.

EDIT: Also apologies that it is not compiling, "it was working fine yesterday" and I have no idea what Cython is trying to tell me.

EDIT2: it was unicode quotes in the citation of the paper, ~600 lines down

It is often better to avoid coercion (ie comparison, operation, etc of elements with distinct parents). For example
- `g**((q-1)/r) == 1` -> `(g**((q-1)/r)).is_one()`
- `A*G**lam != 1` -> `not (A*G**lam).is_one()`

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A11):

Thank you for the feedback!

I have now included the algorithm in the `INPUT`, `EXAMPLES` and `TEST` sections and I have attached my small benchmark script to this ticket.

I have also integrated your suggestions with regard to coercion, however since `J` is an exponent like `k` and `v`, I believe it should always be an integer and shouldn't be an element of `K`.

Lastly, I have expanded the algorithm to include the `self.is_one()` case.

<a id='comment:24'>**Comment 24:**</a>
Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A23):
> More interestingly, if AMM is faster for larger moduli why not make it the default in these cases? Would this dispatch be reasonable:
> - if moduli is small just use Johnston
> - if moduli is large
>     - if a multiplicative generator is already available use Johnston
>     - if not use AMM

Since AMM is actually slightly faster even at small moduli, it could also be made the default in general unless the multiplicative generator is available.

That said, I am not sure how to check whether the generator is available. There does seem to be some caching but I can't see a way to explicitly check it.

There is some caching

```
sage: R = Zmod(next_prime(2**10))
sage: r = R.multiplicative_generator()
sage: R.multiplicative_generator() is r
True
```
or finite fields

```
sage: R = GF(next_prime(2**10)**2)
sage: r = R.multiplicative_generator()
sage: R.multiplicative_generator() is r
True
```
The cache is implemented via the decorator `@cached_method`. To access the cache here is what could be done

```
gen = R.multiplictative_generator.cache
if gen is not None:
    # gen is the multiplicative generator
    ...
else:
    # do not trigger multiplicative generator computation
    ...
```

You should also check timings over very small moduli, e.g things like `GF(2^5)` or `GF(3^10)`.

I added a couple new tests to the benchmarks. Unless you want to set a threshold at something like 11 I don't think it is worth using Johnston for small values.

Whether a particular finite field is faster with Johnston or AMM seems to be fairly randomly distributed with AMM's advantage getting slightly larger as the fields order increases (goes up to 85% AMM better for orders below 10000).

I would suggest making the default simply depend on the availability of a cached multiplicative generator.
