On OSX, various binaries link `libopenblas_$ARCH-$VERSION.dylib` instead of the symlink `libopenblas.dylib`. This obviously breaks Sage whenever we upgrade the openblas version...

On Linux, everything is linked against `libopenblas.so` as it should.

What if we copy dynlibs on MacOS rather than create symlinks? It seems that this is what Apple is actually doing:
e.g. here we can see that `libz.1.dylib` is actually the real library, and the remaining `libz.*dylib` are just symbolic links. 

```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.1.3.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.11.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.5.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.8.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  186432  1 Dec  2017 /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
```
And linking to `libz` leads to linking to  `/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib`

So we can do the same (on MacOS only, arrgh...): always install openblas.dylib under a short name, and the long names would just be symlinks.

Why is this openblas-specific?
I imagine the same would be a problem with any Sage library version bump on OSX...

Another guess might be that the dependency on `$(BLAS)` is not 100% properly processed, and the corresponding generated makefile rules do not trigger the needed rebuilds.

Or perhaps the need to rebuild is not working for some other reason.

Perhaps Erik may say something about it.

One day I need to bite the bullet and study more about how MacOS works in this regard so that I can be more useful.
