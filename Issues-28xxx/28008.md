On OSX, various binaries link `libopenblas_$ARCH-$VERSION.dylib` instead of the symlink `libopenblas.dylib`. This obviously breaks Sage whenever we upgrade the openblas version...

```
osx:build buildbot-sage$ otool -L local/lib64/libffpack.dylib

```
On Linux, everything is linked against `libopenblas.so` as it should.

<a id='comment:5'></a>What if we copy dynlibs on MacOS rather than create symlinks? It seems that this is what Apple is actually doing:
e.g. here we can see that `libz.1.dylib` is actually the real library, and the remaining `libz.*dylib` are just symbolic links. 

```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.1.3.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.11.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.5.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.1.2.8.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  186432  1 Dec  2017 /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 11 Jan  2018 /usr/lib/libz.dylib -> libz.1.dylib
```
And linking to `libz` leads to linking to  `/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib`

So we can do the same (on MacOS only, arrgh...): always install openblas.dylib under a short name, and the long names would just be symlinks.

Why is this openblas-specific?
I imagine the same would be a problem with any Sage library version bump on OSX...

Good question. I upgrade Sage frequently on several different OS X machines, and this is the first time I remember having this problem.
