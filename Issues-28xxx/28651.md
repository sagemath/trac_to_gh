We should consider integrating the library ResSing within sage.
I'm not sure what is the best approach, as Suchandan Pal has left academia.

As a safety precaution, I'm attaching the library and http://www-personal.umich.edu/~psuchand/projects.html, as I'm afraid it might go offline at some point.

**CC:**  @alexjbest

**Status:** new

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28651
