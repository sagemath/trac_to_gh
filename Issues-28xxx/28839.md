ISTM that LGTM is reading from the [GitHub](GitHub) mirror of our repo, so I just need to change its default branch to the develop branch.  I don't *think* there will be any consequences to doing so, so I'll go ahead and do that.

I'm looking at this site, and while many of the alerts look useful, a great many of the "errors" reported are due to supposedly incorrect arguments to a class's `__init__`, except their analysis is not clever enough to consider classes which have a metaclass with a custom `__call__` (e.g. our `ClasscallMetaclass` which is used all over the place).

So perhaps while we're adding this file it might be helpful to globally exclude this and related errors as explained [here](https://help.semmle.com/lgtm-enterprise/user/help/showing-hiding-query-results.html).  For example, from what I'm seeing in the errors, we want at least:

```
queries:
    - exclude: py/call/wrong-named-class-argument
    - exclude: py/call/wrong-number-class-arguments
```

Of course, we can also suppress alerts on individual lines, but these two are so pervasive it would not be practical.  Suppressing them globally unfortunately could hide legitimate errors, though these errors are likely to be caught by tests in most cases.
