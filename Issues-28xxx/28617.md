Over NTL finite fields, comparisons between Frobenius endomorphisms raise an error:

```
sage: FF = GF(2^20)
sage: f = FF.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: f == FF.frobenius_endomorphism()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: None fails to convert into the map's domain Finite Field in z20 of size 2^20, but a `pushforward` method is not properly implemented

Hello Xavier,

Thanks for your quick answer. So I guess the problem lies in the fact that no specific `FrobeniusEndomorphism` class/method has been implemented for the `ntl_gf2e` finite field case.

I had a look on what has been done for "givaro" finite fields, and this seems to be a quite long work... I'm not sure I have time to write everything properly for the moment.

Thanks again,

Julien

The problem comes from the combination of two facts:
- the method `_lmul_` is not implemented for NTL finite fields, so it inherits from the abstract class `Element` and just returns `None`
- in the generic implementation of comparison of morphisms, `_lmul_` is called without further precaution

Actually, I do not see why calling `_lmul_` is needed, so I removed this call... which fixes the problem.

PS: Maybe, we should also implement `_lmul_` for NTL finite fields; I don't know if it's required.

I think we need to hear from the initial implementer.

With the patchbot report, I think I see now why using `_lmul_` is appropriate: it's because this code is supposed to work not only for ring homomorphisms but also for module homomorphisms.

So, I've switched back to the original version but added one test in order to avoid the call to `_lmul_` when a coercion map is defined. I believe it would make things faster.

Let us first look at the case of ring homomorphisms. Consider the following:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: R.<x> = k[] 
sage: phi = R.hom([x^2])
sage: psi = R.hom([x^2], base_map=Frob)
```

Then `phi` is definitely different from `psi` because they act differently of `k`:

```
sage: phi(a)
a
sage: psi(a)
2*a + 1
```

However, `R.gens()` consists only of `x` and `phi(x) = psi(x) = x^3`. Therefore, in order to guarantee that two morphisms coincide, we need to check that they take the same values on the generators of the domain, but also recursively on the generators of the base of the domain, the generators of the base of the base of the domain, etc.

Now, the same occurs with modules. If `A` and `B` and two `K`-modules, it's certainly possible to imagine a mapping `A -> B` which is not `K`-linear (for instance, it could be semi-linear)... though I'm not sure it would be easy/possible to define in Sage.

Actually, it is not exactly what the current code does (both before and after my patch): the current code only checks products with the *last* generator of the module. It looks like a bug but I'm not sure about this (because I don't know precisely what `ModuleMorphism` means in Sage).

Right.. But this is not a relevant example to the current issue. `_lmul_` and `_base` are not involved here.

Putting the math behind `_richcmp_` aside, the direct cause of the failure is that `g._lmul_(h)` does not work (returns `None`) for g in the finite field k and h in the prime base field of k.

Hi,
I'm quite new to Sage, but why exactly `e` would be different from `<ModuleElement>e` when `e` is the generator of the finite field ?

If we get into that, 

```
    if e is not None and isinstance(e, ModuleElement):
       gens = [(<ModuleElement>e)._lmul_(x) for x in gens]
```

`e` should be an instance of `ModuleElement`, isn't it ? Therefore, I don't get why there is this coercion in the first place, which is removed in [klee](#comment%3A15)'s proposal.

Obviously, they are different : If we keep this coercion, we still have the failure, even when `_lmul_` is defined for `FiniteRingElement`. However, `e == <ModuleElement>e` evaluates to `True`. Can someone explain to me the difference please ?

I had the same question. My guess is what follows. With the coercion, `_lmul_` defined on `ModuleElement` class is invoked, and somehow leads to the failure. Without the coercion, `_lmul_` defined on `FiniteRingElement` is invoked, and I provided an implementation of that method.

Equality test is on a different level, and complicated. This being `True` is not relevant with the behavior of the above code in issue.

I guess not. I hope not.

Frobenius maps are not defined on `None`, mathematically. The above are just consequences of Sage coercion (different concept from the Cython coercion above) of `None` to `0` element.

I think that at least the code needs to make sure that the last generator is non-zero. For example, this fails in this case:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: R.<x,y> = K['x,y'].quotient('y')
sage: id = R.Hom(R).identity()
sage: f = R.hom(R.gens(), R, base_map=K.hom([-a], K))
sage: f == id  # should be False
True
```
(Currently, this fails because `_lmul_` returns `None`, though.)

This example is from ticket [ticket:30938#comment:3], where we were also confused about this `_richcmp_` implementation.

Done. But the example still fails as you said.

If I am not mistaken, there is still a problem with the theory behind this. For example:

```
sage: S.<a,b> = QQ['a,b'].quotient(['a*b'])
sage: R.<x> = S['x']
sage: f = R.hom([b], R, base_map=S.hom([-a, b], S))
sage: g = R.hom([b], R)
sage: f == g  # False is correct
False
```
The above only gives the correct answer because `f` and `g` have the same type, so a different comparison function is used. With the generic implementation, this gives the wrong answer:

```
sage: from sage.structure.richcmp import op_EQ
sage: from sage.rings.morphism import RingMap
sage: RingMap._richcmp_(f, g, op_EQ)  # should be False
True
```
Here, `f(x)==g(x)` and `f(a*x)==g(a*x)` does not imply `f(a)==g(a)`, so the implementation relies on a cancellation property that does not hold in general.

As a module, `x` does not generate `R`, but `R` is generated by all monomials in `x`. In this case, the monomial `x^0` is the only generator for which the images of `a*x^0`, `b*x^0` allow to distinguish `f` and `g`.

It may be necessary to separate the implementations for rings and modules. For rings, it is enough to check that `f` and `g` agree on the generators of the ring and, recursively, on the generators of the base ring. For modules, I am not so sure – maybe we need to restrict to the case of module *homomorphisms* and raise a `NotImplementedError` otherwise.

Good point.

Assuming cancellation property is reasonable for most ring and modules in Sage. So I think the implementation is okay for generic morphisms. You just showed that it is not adequate for general rings. Fortunately Sage seems to provide a different implementation for the exceptional rings as you explained. 

I would document that the implementation for generic morphisms is assuming cancellation property so that future developers be warned for the trap.

There are ways to construct the same maps but with different Python types, which seems to be the original motivation for #24281. Here are two examples, where the generic implementation is used:

```
sage: S.<a,b> = QQ['a,b'].quotient('a*b')
sage: R.<x> = S[]
sage: f = R.hom([b], R)
sage: g = R.hom([b], R) * R.hom(S.hom([-a, b], S), R)
sage: f == g  # should be False
True
```

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.flatten import SpecializationMorphism
sage: f2 = SpecializationMorphism(R, {x:b})
sage: g2 = R.hom([b], S, base_map=S.hom([-a, b], S))
sage: f2 == g2  # should be False
True
```
So making assumptions in the generic implementation which do not hold in general opens the door to mathematically wrong answers.

I agree that the generic implementation is not perfect, and it needs to be replaced if someone comes up with a better one. On the other hand, the current patch solves the problem of this ticket by improving the implementation. 

If a perfect solution is not around now, I suggest to open another ticket for it later.

I think the recursion should limit to the base ring of the base ring for module morphisms. For ring morphisms, the implementation seems inherently flawed as Markus showed.

Anyway, the patch fixes the problem of the ticket but do not alter the logic or algorithm of the implementation. The flaw of the algorithm should now be dealt with in #31783. I hope that someone with a proved algorithm propose a patch to completely fix the morphism comparison problem in Sage.

I think it needs to go down as deep as possible. This is what the code currently does.

As suggested by Kwankyu, I think that we should close this ticket now (in order to fix the issue as soon as possible) and continue the discussion (which could take some time) in #31783.

That's why I'm giving again a positive review to this ticket. Feel free to revert this decision if you strongly disagree.
