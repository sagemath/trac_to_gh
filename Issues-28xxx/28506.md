The following returns a `TypeError`:

```
sage: s2 = polytopes.simplex(2)
sage: s3 = polytopes.simplex(3)
sage: t = s2.direct_sum(s3)
```

H-Polyhedra might have non-integral vertices and it is hard to tell from the H-Representation, whether this this is the case.

We fix `direct_sum`, `minkowski_difference` and `face_truncation` to try the quotient ring, if the given base ring does not work.

I'll fix it. Should be fast.

As far as I know, it's difficult to determine, whether this operation can be done with ring `ZZ`. So there are basically two options:

- try the operation with coerced base rings and go to quotient field, if it fails (this is how `intersection` handles it)
- just go to field in all cases.

What do you think is better?

`minkowski_difference` fails for the same reason. This fails, as coercing base rings may not suffice:

```
sage: Q = Polyhedron([[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: S = Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,2]])
sage: S.minkowski_difference(Q)
```

Same for `face_truncation` (also there is no example of linear coefficients in the docstring):

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(3)
sage: P.face_truncation(P.faces(0)[0], linear_coefficients=[0,1,2], cut_frac=1)
```

I did both approaches. The approach that always takes the fraction is pushed into `public/28506-bis`.

I guess there are pros and cons of both methods. I think most important cons are:
- `try ... except` might take more much more time (I assume it can theoretically compute almost everything)
- `try ... except` is a bad approach, if there was ever a thing as a lazy polyhedron (but then again, its a bad idea to set up a lazy Polyhedron in `ZZ` from inequalities and don't check, whether this works)
- always taking fraction field changes the behavior of the methods (and it looks awful for Minkowski decomposition)

Btw, the constructor sets up all H-Polyhedra with base ring as field unless one specifies a specific base ring.

Actually, I think this is the better approach, as construction should be done with a parent, for which they are well-defined, e.g.:

- intersection of Polyhedra in `ZZ^2` are only well-defined in `QQ^2`, it's strange if some constructions have parent `ZZ^2`, while others have parent `QQ^2`
- `face_truncation` for Polyhedra over `ZZ` is only well-defined if we lift them up to `QQ`

The tests should actually return something, so I would remove `t = ` and let the output get printed.

I am still a bit puzzled as to why it did not work for direct sum. What was going on there?

```
sage: s2 = polytopes.simplex(2)
sage: s2.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: s = polytopes.simplex(2)
sage: s.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: s = s.change_ring(QQ)
sage: t = s.direct_sum(s)
sage: t.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
 A vertex at (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
 A vertex at (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
 A vertex at (1/3, 1/3, 1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 2/3),
 A vertex at (1/3, 1/3, 1/3, -1/3, 2/3, -1/3),
 A vertex at (1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 2/3, -1/3, -1/3))
```

Does this answer your question? As mentioned, direct sum (as well as intersection, minkowski difference and face truncation) are only defined for polytopes/polyhedra over a field.

In the same way, that `sage: 6/2` returns a rational, I think those operations should return a polytope with base ring constructed by first coercing and then taking the fraction field.

As mentioned. I think this approach is actually more suitable and at some point, we should change `intersection` accordingly.

Yes, this examples clarifies it. It should probably go right among the first examples to illustrate the construction.

I was extremely confused, but now it makes sense. The problem is when we translate one of them to have center be the origin...

Yes, sounds reasonable.
