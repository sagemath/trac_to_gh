The following returns a `TypeError`:

```
sage: s2 = polytopes.simplex(2)
sage: s3 = polytopes.simplex(3)
sage: t = s2.direct_sum(s3)
```

H-Polyhedra might have non-integral vertices and it is hard to tell from the H-Representation, whether this this is the case.

We fix `direct_sum`, `minkowski_difference` and `face_truncation` to try the quotient ring, if the given base ring does not work.

I'll fix it. Should be fast.

As far as I know, it's difficult to determine, whether this operation can be done with ring `ZZ`. So there are basically two options:

- try the operation with coerced base rings and go to quotient field, if it fails (this is how `intersection` handles it)
- just go to field in all cases.

What do you think is better?

`minkowski_difference` fails for the same reason. This fails, as coercing base rings may not suffice:

```
sage: Q = Polyhedron([[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: S = Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,2]])
sage: S.minkowski_difference(Q)
```

Same for `face_truncation` (also there is no example of linear coefficients in the docstring):

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(3)
sage: P.face_truncation(P.faces(0)[0], linear_coefficients=[0,1,2], cut_frac=1)
```

I did both approaches. The approach that always takes the fraction is pushed into `public/28506-bis`.

I guess there are pros and cons of both methods. I think most important cons are:
- `try ... except` might take more much more time (I assume it can theoretically compute almost everything)
- `try ... except` is a bad approach, if there was ever a thing as a lazy polyhedron (but then again, its a bad idea to set up a lazy Polyhedron in `ZZ` from inequalities and don't check, whether this works)
- always taking fraction field changes the behavior of the methods (and it looks awful for Minkowski decomposition)

Btw, the constructor sets up all H-Polyhedra with base ring as field unless one specifies a specific base ring.

Actually, I think this is the better approach, as construction should be done with a parent, for which they are well-defined, e.g.:

- intersection of Polyhedra in `ZZ^2` are only well-defined in `QQ^2`, it's strange if some constructions have parent `ZZ^2`, while others have parent `QQ^2`
- `face_truncation` for Polyhedra over `ZZ` is only well-defined if we lift them up to `QQ`

In the same way, that `sage: 6/2` returns a rational, I think those operations should return a polytope with base ring constructed by first coercing and then taking the fraction field.

Yes, this examples clarifies it. It should probably go right among the first examples to illustrate the construction.

I was extremely confused, but now it makes sense. The problem is when we translate one of them to have center be the origin...

Yes, sounds reasonable.
