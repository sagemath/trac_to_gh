Currently, computing facets of a lattice polytope, changes whether it is reflexive or not.

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3).dual()); p
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a = p.faces()[0][0]
sage: p = LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3).dual()); p
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a = p.faces()[0][0]; a
-1-d lattice polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: a.facet_normals()
Empty collection
in 3-d lattice N
sage: a
-1-d reflexive polytope in 3-d lattice M
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Sorry. I was completely puzzled about this and exaggerated.

As you can probably tell, I stumbled open this trying to implement incidence matrix.

I still don't get the advantage of the current setup. Is it because we avoid making a copy of the constants?

What currently happens with `is_reflexive` is that it implicitly calls `compute_facets`, which computes the value for `is_reflexive`. However, `is_reflexive` now recomputes the value and returns it. I don't think this is ideal.

This time I did not delete any trailing spaces etc. Implementing the incidence matrix in #28743 will take care of that.
