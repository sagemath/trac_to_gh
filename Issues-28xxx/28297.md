Micro-benchmark (maybe of limited relevance):

```   
sage: NF.<a> = NumberField(x^7 + 2, embedding=QQbar(-2)^(1/7))
sage: b = ((-7*a^6 + 3*a^4 - 5*a^3 + 2*a^2 - 4)/42)^10
sage: c = ((-7*a^6 + 7*a^4 - 5*a^3 + 2*a^2 - 4)/56)^10
```    
Before:

```    
sage: %timeit b+c
The slowest run took 5.91 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.76 µs per loop
```    
After:

```    
sage: %timeit b+c
The slowest run took 8.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.34 µs per loop
```

There seem to be a lot more opportunities to further improve basic arithmetic operations by removing gcds at the right moment. Please feel free to hijack the ticket if you find the time and energy to have a look!
