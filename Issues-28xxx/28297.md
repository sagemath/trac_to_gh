Micro-benchmark (maybe of limited relevance):

```   
sage: NF.<a> = NumberField(x^7 + 2, embedding=QQbar(-2)^(1/7))
sage: b = ((-7*a^6 + 3*a^4 - 5*a^3 + 2*a^2 - 4)/42)^10
sage: c = ((-7*a^6 + 7*a^4 - 5*a^3 + 2*a^2 - 4)/56)^10
```    
Before:

```    
sage: %timeit b+c
The slowest run took 5.91 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.76 µs per loop
```    
After:

```    
sage: %timeit b+c
The slowest run took 8.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.34 µs per loop
```

There seem to be a lot more opportunities to further improve basic arithmetic operations by removing gcds at the right moment. Please feel free to hijack the ticket if you find the time and energy to have a look!

Seems straightforward:

The addition to `_reduce_c_()` bails out early if the denominator is one because in that case there's nothing to do. The check is cheap and avoids several other function calls that do nothing when the denominator is one, so I believe it's an improvement on average.

The changes to  `_add_()` and `_sub_()` are identical. We now pull out the GCD of the two denominators (which are smallish numbers) early, and it eventually cancels out. This would happen anyway when we call `_reduce_c_()` before `return`ing, but at that point we would be cancelling the same GCD out of the relatively-largish product of the denominators. I have faith that doing it early at least makes things no worse, and your numbers show an improvement, so it's fine by me. (This also makes it more likely that we hit the new "fast return" in `_reduce_c_()`.)

Could you please describe the changes in a bit more detail in the commit message? That's my only nitpick.
