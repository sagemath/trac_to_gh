Consider the claw S<sub>3</sub>:

```
S3 = Graph([[0,1,2,3],[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]])
```

The following combinatorial embedding is respected in the planar layout (the neighbors are in the given clockwise order):

```
S3.set_embedding({0: [1,2,3], 1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [0]})
S3.layout('planar', save_pos=True)
S3.show()
```

While this one isn't:

```
S3.set_embedding({0: [3,2,1], 1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [0]})
S3.layout('planar', save_pos=True)
S3.show()
```

In the latter, the neighbors are in the *counter*clockwise order (in fact the picture is the same as the former).

Strictly speaking, `layout_planar` (which is called by `layout`) does not promise to use the combinatorial embedding. But it does provide an option `on_embedding` which I assume should allow this:

```
S3.set_pos(S3.layout_planar(on_embedding={0: [3,2,1], 1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [0]}))
```

Still, the combinatorial embedding is not respected. I think this is because in `layout_planar` the line `G.is_planar(set_embedding=True)` executed unconditionally (totally ignoring `on_embedding`).

Keywords: graph,planar,clockwise,embedding

Now the patchbot passed all tests.

I also made the documentation more precise about which combinatorial embedding is used. But unfortunately it is not as rburing thought (and I think to be more intuitive, too) that `on_embedding` is always used if it is given. If `set_embedding` is set to `True`, then `on_embedding` is ignored. So the question is if we could/should/want to change this behavior.
