I like this.  A few questions:
* Are there any other attributes of `Texture` that may go missing in a similar way?  Might as well get them all at once.
* In particular, where does `texture.color` go - presumably it's used elsewhere?
* Can you think of a relevant doctest (perhaps from the ask.sagemath question) that could be added?

No idea, and no time to check. I do not think so, I would say.

Well, it's used everywhere. The Texture object that is transmitted after cutting the surface contains both the color and the opacity. For some reason the opacity is not fetched from the Texture but needs to be given through an additional parameter.

Well, one could test Q.texture.opacity after the cutting, sure.
