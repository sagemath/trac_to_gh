I like this.  A few questions:
* Are there any other attributes of `Texture` that may go missing in a similar way?  Might as well get them all at once.
* In particular, where does `texture.color` go - presumably it's used elsewhere?
* Can you think of a relevant doctest (perhaps from the ask.sagemath question) that could be added?
