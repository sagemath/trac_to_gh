I like this.  A few questions:
* Are there any other attributes of `Texture` that may go missing in a similar way?  Might as well get them all at once.
* In particular, where does `texture.color` go - presumably it's used elsewhere?
* Can you think of a relevant doctest (perhaps from the ask.sagemath question) that could be added?

Well, it's used everywhere. The Texture object that is transmitted after cutting the surface contains both the color and the opacity. For some reason the opacity is not fetched from the Texture but needs to be given through an additional parameter.

Agreed that the new doctest is better and does capture the issue.  Unfortunately the other platform-dependent thing probably should be sorted out - or at least mentioned as "known bug" or something if you think they are somewhat orthogonal and deserve a different ticket.  Although I cannot test it on my local install now this should be the right solution.

I would say that any other problem should go to another ticket.

If I run into them (or someone else does) with more detail, ok.  This ticket seems good to go, though as I say I can't test its efficacy in viewing it in a local build.
