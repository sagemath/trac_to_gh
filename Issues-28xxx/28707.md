This ticket allows to pass extra parameters to the method `IntegratedCurve.solve()` in order to control the numerical ODE solver. In particular, this allows to fix an issue with the `odeint` solver by increasing its precision via some tolerance parameters (see [comment:1](#comment%3A1) for details).

Besides, this ticket makes the `odeint` solver (introduced in #25936) the default one, instead of `rk4_maxima`, since the former is much faster than
the latter, as already noticed in #25936. The method name `'ode_int'` has been changed to `'odeint'`, in order to match with `desolve_odeint()` and the [SciPy name](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html) (for backward compatibility, `method='ode_int'` is still accepted though).

Moreover, this ticket performs some improvement of the documentation of integrated curves.

Attachment: **[test_geod.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket28707/test_geod.png)**

In Sage 8.9, when integrating a null geodesic in Schwarzschild spacetime with an impact parameter close to critical (all details are in [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Notebooks/test_geodesics.ipynb)), the solution obtained with `solve(method='ode_int')` (green in the figure below) differs significantly from those obtained by means of other solvers, for instance the `rkf45` solver (red in the figure below):

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket28707/test_geod_bad.png)

The geodesic arises from the upper right (*(x,y)* approx. (10, 5)), circles twice around the black hole (the grey area) and then departs away to the lower left (`rkf45` "exact" solution) or to the lower right (`ode_int` bad solution). 
This issue is due to the default values of 1.49012e-8 for the parameters `rtol` and `atol` of
[scipy.integrate.odeint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html) being not sufficient in the present case. Now, with the Sage 8.9 implementation of `IntegratedCurve.solve()`, there is no way to change the values of  `rtol` and `atol`. Thanks to the new argument `**control_param` introduced here this becomes possible. Morevoer, the default values of 
`rtol` and `atol` are changed to 1.e-10. Accordingly, the curves obtained from the `odeint` and  `rkf45` become almost undistinguishable:

See the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Notebooks/test_geodesics.ipynb) for a detailed study of the agreement between `odeint` and the other solvers when using the code of this ticket branch.

The diff for the failed plugin only contain 2 lines:
