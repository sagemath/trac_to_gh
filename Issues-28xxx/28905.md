Provide `spkg-configure.m4` to use libcdd/cdd from the system. 

This ticket is limited to systems that install headers into `/usr/include` rather than `/usr/include/cdd` (Debian) or `/usr/include/cddlib` (Fedora).

Follow-up: #29413 (Upgrade cddlib, fix cddlib header search for packages latte_int, gfan, topcom)

Are there Dockerfiles or Docker images available that allow testing of the Gentoo Sage distribution?
Off-topic for this ticket - but I would like to add a continuous integration test for https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin

coinor is too old in Gentoo. I tried to do an upgrade privately sometime last year. Unfortunately I lost the ebuilds in a mishap (and they weren't on vcs yet when it happened). I couldn't get it to work with sage which was annoying.

The closest thing to a Docker image we have are the KVM images that the openstack project maintains:

this branch does not go far enough: on Debian the headers are in `/usr/include/cdd/`, and
on Fedora they are in `/usr/include/cddlib/`.

I think Singular is able to use cddlib headers from any of these locations.

I think libcdd* ought to be tested too.

I left a comment about this in the macro before I got sidetracked. It looks to me like the sage lattE and gfan spkgs only look for the cddlib headers in the standard locations, so the system cddlib will only be usable if the headers are in the standard location. Is that wrong?

The next release of cddlib will use the `cddlib` prefix for its headers. But for now, our latte and gfan packages only look for the bare `cdd.h`, so that's what we need to check for. Can we merge this now, and then update things as they change?

<a id='comment:46'>Comment 46:</a>
Detects cddlib correctly on `archlinux-latest-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774833).

We don't have a test for Gentoo (#29105, hint hint), but I assume you have tested it there.

As expected, not detected on debian and fedora. I have created follow-up ticket #29413 for that and edited the ticket description.
