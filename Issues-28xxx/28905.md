Provide `spkg-configure.m4` to use libcdd/cdd from the system. 

This ticket is limited to systems that install headers into `/usr/include` rather than `/usr/include/cdd` (Debian) or `/usr/include/cddlib` (Fedora).

Follow-up: #29413 (Upgrade cddlib, fix cddlib header search for packages latte_int, gfan, topcom)

Are there Dockerfiles or Docker images available that allow testing of the Gentoo Sage distribution?
Off-topic for this ticket - but I would like to add a continuous integration test for https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin

coinor is too old in Gentoo. I tried to do an upgrade privately sometime last year. Unfortunately I lost the ebuilds in a mishap (and they weren't on vcs yet when it happened). I couldn't get it to work with sage which was annoying.

The closest thing to a Docker image we have are the KVM images that the openstack project maintains:

In theory you can boot one of those up, configure the sage-on-gentoo overlay,

this branch does not go far enough: on Debian the headers are in `/usr/include/cdd/`, and
on Fedora they are in `/usr/include/cddlib/`.

I think Singular is able to use cddlib headers from any of these locations.

I think libcdd* ought to be tested too.

-and part of executables into `/usr/lib/cdd-tools/`
+This ticket is limited to systems that install headers into `/usr/include` rather than `/usr/include/cdd` (Debian) or `/usr/include/cddlib` (Fedora).

Detects cddlib correctly on `archlinux-latest-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774833).

We don't have a test for Gentoo (#29105, hint hint), but I assume you have tested it there.

As expected, not detected on debian and fedora. I have created follow-up ticket #29413 for that and edited the ticket description.
