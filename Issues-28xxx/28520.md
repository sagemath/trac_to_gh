The following innocent code gives a TypeError:

```
e=random_matrix(ZZ,4,5,algorithm='echelon_form')
```
while I should have given:

```
e=random_matrix(ZZ,4,5,algorithm='echelon_form', num_pivots=3)
```

The code should just use a random value for the number of pivots when the argument isn't given.

Component: **linear algebra**

I would like to work on this issue. 
So, when either `random_matrix()` or `matrix.random()` is called with the keyword argument `algorithm=echelon_form`, the following piece of code gets run:

```
   def random_matrix(...):
      ...
      elif algorithm == 'echelon_form':
          return random_rref_matrix(parent, *args, **kwds)
```

This calls the following signature:

```
def random_rref_matrix(parent, num_pivots)
```

Both of these pieces of code are in the file: `sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/special.py`

Now I guess I have two options to fix it:

1. Make changes in the `random_matrix()` function:
    I could check whether kwds has the value `num_pivots`. If it doesn't, I will call `random_rref_matrix` with a random number in the range [0, min(nrows, ncols)]. Will also have to check if `ncols` is there or not. 

I guess this is safe but will make the code look a little ugly.

2. Make changes to the `random_rref_matrix()` function:
    I will change the signature to include a `*args` and a `**kwds`. Check within the function for the existence of `num_pivots` and assign `num_pivots` appropriately if it is not there. 

Will have to ensure the error messages would be the same as before? Seems a bit unsafe as a lot of other functions might call this function, but should be cleaner.

Which way should I proceed? Is there anything I'm missing?
