seen at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49232/latex-problem-using-result-obtained-from-fricas-integrate/.

Using sagemath 8.9, when asking sagemath for latex of a math expression which contains something like `log_integral`, it generates in latex `log_integral` which does not typeset well due to underscore. Better translation would be `\logintegral`, this allows one to make a math operator using `\DeclareMathOperator{\logintegral}{log\_integral}`

But it is not possible to do this now as things stands.  Here is an example


```
sage: var('t')
sage: result=integrate(1/log(t)^2,t, algorithm="fricas")
sage: result

(log(t)*log_integral(t) - t)/log(t)

sage: latex(result)

\frac{\log\left(t\right) log_integral\left(t\right) - t}{\log\left(t\right)}

```

The latex above would be better as


```
sage: latex(result)

\frac{\log\left(t\right) \logintegral\left(t\right) - t}{\log\left(t\right)}

```

even though `\logintegral` is not known to Latex, it can be made a known math name using `\DeclareMathOperator` as shown above.

EDIT: In order to avoid macros that are not known to Latex, we can define the Latex name to be `\operatorname{log\_integral}`.
