Should these be marked `# py2`?

One [comment there](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27529#comment:25) was that if `python` is `python3`, then the tests would work. I just created a symlink `python -> python3` here, and the tests still fail. I think either marking the tests as `py2`, or removing them (#26457) would be good. Or would #25358 help?

I'm wondering about a followup ticket, but I don't know if this would be a good idea: currently, the script `sage-python23` checks for the value of `SAGE_PYTHON3` to decide which version of Python to run, and the same is true when running `sage --python`. Should we (a) actively delete `local/bin/python` when building with Python 3 (relevant in the case of updating existing installations of Sage), and then (b) have `sage-python23` and `sage --python` run `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` if if exists, `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python3` otherwise? Is it good to not depend on the environment variable `SAGE_PYTHON3`?

If we ever hope to use a system version of Python, I guess this would be a bad idea.
