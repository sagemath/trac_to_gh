This ticket improves the string representation of Macaulay2 elements that usually acquire the name of the global variable they are assigned to, such as polynomial rings and varieties.

Currently, Sage implicitly calls `describe` to get a string representation that avoids the global names, in particular those of internal Expect variables `sage0`, `sage1`,… which are not meaningful to a user. This ticket changes the assignment operator for these internal variables from `=` to `<-` to keep internal variables from acquiring the names, which was suggested by the developers [upstream](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/issues/967#issuecomment-513470518). As a result, calling `describe` is no longer necessary and the string representation becomes much nicer. Previously, this output could not be obtained at all (this is what `describe` used to return in old versions of M2):

```
sage: macaulay2('QQ[x,y,z]')
QQ[x, y, z]
```
It is still possible to call `describe` explicitly:

```
sage: macaulay2('QQ[x,y,z]').describe()
QQ[x..z, Degrees => {3:1}, Heft => {1}, MonomialOrder => {MonomialSize => 32}, DegreeRank => 1]
                                                         {GRevLex => {3:1}  }
                                                         {Position => Up    }
```
Also, if a user specifies the variable name, the element assumes that name as usual in Macaulay2:

```
sage: R = macaulay2('QQ[x,y,z]', 'R'); R
R
```
