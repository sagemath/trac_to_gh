The following code does not work as mentioned functions currently go to the algebraic closure:

```
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(F, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([-y^3, a*x^3 - 3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 - y^3])
sage: f.is_postcritically_finite()
```

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(7)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(F, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
sage: f.multiplier_spectra(1)
```

We call field_of_definition_critical/field_of_definition_periodic on f to change ring to a finite extension instead of QQbar, so that functionality is preserved for number fields. 

Additionally, we add _is_preperiodic and is_postcritically_finite to the DynamicalSystem_projective_finite_field class: every point is preperiodic over a finite field, so both functions should return True. If return_period=True in _is_preperiodic, we call orbit_structure. 
In order to normalize output, we modify orbit_structure to return (m,n) as a tuple instead of a list. 

In doctests for multiplier_spectra, using field of definition instead of QQbar permuted multipliers in several outputs. We corrected this and hope to prevent similar issues by sorting the output.

These changes allow is_postcritically_finite and multiplier_spectra to work over finite fields as well.
