-Although we can use the `_latex_` method in an object in order to get a latex version of the object, at times it would be beneficial to additionally have a TikZ implementation.

-As an example, the following plot

-`latex(line([(0,0), (1,1)]))`

-Implementing tikz alongside latex also has its benefits as in some instances, some users do not like to use tikz. This would help handle this situtation.
