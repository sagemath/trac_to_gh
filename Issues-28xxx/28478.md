In #12719 (2012) we upgraded to iPython 0.13 and added a custom crash handler, which doesn't display a traceback when Sage crashes at startup.  At the time I was frustrated with the change: it's annoying to have to open up the crash log when you introduce a syntax or name error, or import something from the wrong file.  I didn't realize until this afternoon that it's trivial to include a traceback by default.

I think that it's not a problem to include the traceback even for non-developers, since the last message seen will be the current error report.
