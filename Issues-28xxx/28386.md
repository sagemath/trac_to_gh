As reported in [Ask SageMath question #47562](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47562/calling-singularinvariant_ring/), this fails:

```
sage: singular.lib('finvar.lib')
sage: R = singular.ring(3, '(x0,x1)', 'dp')
sage: g = singular.matrix(2,2,'1,0,1,1')
sage: singular.invariant_ring(g)
...
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? assign not impl.
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 16: `        return(P,S);`
```

The reason is that the return type (tuple/list) is not understood.

Workaround (which suggests a solution):

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.singular import SingularElement
sage: SingularElement(singular, 'list', 'invariant_ring(%s)' % g.name(), False).sage()
[[            x0 x0^2*x1 - x1^3], [1]]
```

Keywords: **Singular, finvar, invariant_ring**

Indeed, `SingularElement.__getitem__` is inherited from `ExpectElement`; it calls `Singular.new` (inherited from `Expect`) which is a wrapper around `Singular.__call__`, but it doesn't pass any extra arguments like the `type` that `Singular.__call__` supports, so the `type` defaults to `'def'`, while it should be something like `type='list'` in this case (?).

So maybe `SingularElement.__getitem__` should overridden to be smarter and pass a `type` argument to `Singular.__call__` when appropriate (instead of calling `Singular.new`)?

Further, `singular.invariant_ring` is a `SingularFunction` with a `__call__` method (inherited from `ExpectFunction`) which calls `Singular.function_call` (inherited from `Expect.function_call`) which does some string conversion and then calls `Singular.new`; again there is no `type` argument passed to `Singular.__call__` so it defaults to `'def'`. So maybe `SingularFunction.__call__` should be overridden (to pass a `type`) as well?

In both cases, it could be tricky to decide what `type` to pass based on the input.
