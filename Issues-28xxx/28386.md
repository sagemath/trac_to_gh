As reported in [Ask SageMath question #47562](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47562/calling-singularinvariant_ring/), this fails:

```
sage: singular.lib('finvar.lib')
sage: R = singular.ring(3, '(x0,x1)', 'dp')
sage: g = singular.matrix(2,2,'1,0,1,1')
sage: singular.invariant_ring(g)
...
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? assign not impl.
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 16: `        return(P,S);`
```

The reason is that the return type (tuple/list) is not understood.

Workaround (which suggests a solution):

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.singular import SingularElement
sage: SingularElement(singular, 'list', 'invariant_ring(%s)' % g.name(), False).sage()
[[            x0 x0^2*x1 - x1^3], [1]]
```

Keywords: Singular,finvar,invariant_ring

Status: new
