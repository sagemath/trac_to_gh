On macOS, the following:

```
sage: gcd(x, QQbar(I))
```
correctly returns `1` in most Sage sessions,
but raises an error in a tenth to a third of sessions:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +:
'Algebraic Real Field' and 'Number Field in I
with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I'
```

That issue was discussed at #28489, but covered up hastily
because it was blocking Sage on Python 3.

The solution there by flagging the problematic doctests with
"known bugs" is a bad solution, since the problem of the
doctests is not wrong answers but  intermittent failures.

This ticket would welcome a real solution. The aim is not to
get correct answers for all cases in symbolic gcd computation,
but to avoid uncontrolled failures.
