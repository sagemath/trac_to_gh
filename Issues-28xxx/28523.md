The signature for the methods `random_element` of `ZZ` and `RR` are currently different.

More precisely if one wants to specify a lower bound and an upper bound
for the random variable, the signatures are

```
ZZ.random_element(x=minValue, y=maxValue)
RR.random_element(min=minValue, max=maxValue)
```

The syntax for `RR.random_element` is rather confusing as well. For instance

```
RR.random_element(min=2)
```
returns a random number between 0 and 2, so 2 is the upper bound.

Finally, the documentation for `random_matrix` mentions the `x` and `y` parameters for random integer matrices without insisting on the fact that this is specific to integer matrices.

It looks to me as though

```
RR.random_element(min=M)
```
returns a random number between 1 and M, not 0 and M. Well, with `M=2`, if it's between 1 and 2, then it's also between 0 and 2, but it should never actually be less than 1 in that case.

The method chooses a random number between 0 and 1 and then rescales it to lie between `min` (default -1) and `max` (default 1), regardless of which of `min` or `max` is larger. This is actually what the documentation says: 

```
Return a uniformly distributed random number between ``min`` and ``max`` (default -1 to 1)
```
The names `min` and `max` are perhaps misleading.

I can see reasons for both the `ZZ` behavior and the `RR` behavior. What changes do you propose?

I am rather new here, so I do not have rigid opinions. I see pro and con to both syntaxes. The important thing to me is that the signatures should be the same for all `random_element` methods.

If the choice is to use the keywords `min` and `max` then the default behaviors of
`random_element` should probably be something like

```
RR.random_element(min=m)
```

renders a random element between `m` and some larger default (larger value)

```
RR.random_element(max=M)
```

renders a random element between some default (smaller) and `M` and

I'm expanding the ticket description to mention `random_matrix`,
since that was the starting point for RÃ©mi's puzzlement, based
on which I encouraged him to open a ticket.

The documentation for `random_matrix` should mention the fact
that the extra arguments and keywords will be passed on to
`A.randomize()` with `A` initialized as a zero matrix over the
specified ring, and that these arguments will likely in turn be
passed to `ring.random_element` for that ring. It should warn
the user that different rings might require different arguments,
even to perform similar functions, and it should invite the user
to check the documentation for `ring.random_element` for
the rings they need.

While the same arguments, min and max, make sense for picking
an integer or a real at random, min and max might not suffice or
make sense for all rings: for random rationals we may hope to set
max denominator,  for random polynomials max degree, etc.
