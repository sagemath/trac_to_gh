Arguments in AC_LINK_IFELSE there were totally mixed up.
(Found by analogy of a similar error made on #28333, and caught

It only worked by a "miracle".

I see, good catch. I'm not sure by what miracle this even worked at all.

I'll test when I get back to a computer, but I think this is probably right.
