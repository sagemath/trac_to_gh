Arguments in AC_LINK_IFELSE there were totally mixed up.
(Found by analogy of a similar error made on #28333, and caught

I see, good catch. I'm not sure by what miracle this even worked at all.

I'll test when I get back to a computer, but I think this is probably right.

Was it definitely adjusting `LIBS` before, or just `LDFLAGS`?  Oh well, in any case, this is clearly better.  I only want to test to see for myself.

It hasn't been a problem yet that I know of, and it might even be useful.  Just thought I would mention it.
