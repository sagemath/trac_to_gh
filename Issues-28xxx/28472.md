I get one failure on debian+py3, but I don't know why it would be related to this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 206.7 src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py", line 72, in sage_setup.optional_extension.OptionalExtension
Failed example:
    print(ext.__class__.__name__)
Expected:
    Extension
Got:
    CythonizeExtension
**********************************************************************
```
Otherwise, it fixes the problem at #28454, and it works on OS X.
