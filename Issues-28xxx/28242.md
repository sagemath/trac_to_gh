libpari-gmp is a dependency of many packages, so it's important to be able to use the one from the system.

We check that system's PARI/GP environment is close enough to what we would install in Sage (i.e. versions of GP and libpari, and that they share the datadir). Also, PARI packages need to be checked.

<a id='comment:1'></a>we should use sample GP commands to test for packages, as in https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html:

```
  ellinit("11a1")     /* package: elldata */
  galoisgetpol(8)     /* package: galpol */
  galoisgetname(12,1) /* package: galpol 4.0 and up */
  ellmodulareqn(11)   /* package: seadata */
  polgalois(x^8-2)    /* package: galdata */
```

if only the small version of `seadata` is installed, `ellmodulareqn(211)` produces an error (it does work with the "normal" `seadata` version).


need to figure out how to test for `nftables`.

And not only standard packages pari_galdata and

The optional package pari_nftables is clearly an afterthought (not used anywhere in sagelib, too), and I don't want to rule out an otherwise OK installation of PARI/GP, is it is missing (e.g. Debian doesn't even ship it, although Fedora does ship it; not sure about Conda and Gentoo).

pari_jupyter should be installable regardless.

Upstream is committing the cardinal sin of not versioning their data packages. The tarball is always called exactly the same - even when the content is changed. You understand that's a bit of a problem for automated build scripts that rely on a stored checksum to verify that the package is authentic.

For info, I had the stuff packaged in Gentoo and I recently updated it.

Is there a way to avoid checking for the optional packages? Maybe build PARI from SPKG if the optional package is not found, but requested.

I just packaged all the optional PARI database packages on conda including nftables.

Conda puts it into `<prefix>/lib/pari/pari.cfg`. We don't package `gp2c` yet.

<a id='comment:48'></a>I was working on FreeBSD with 9.1.beta9 and pari as a system package without any problem related to gp / pari.

Yesterday I switched to 9.1.rc1, with the same external package, and now the compilation of cysignals aborts with this message:

Anyone with the same problem on other OS, or is it specific to FreeBSD?

<a id='comment:53'></a>Actually the problem was different! Pari's spkg-configure.m4 is broken: I thought that I was using pari from the system packages, but I was not.

spkg-configure.m4 includes unescaped [ ] and it produces an error.

A fix could be:
