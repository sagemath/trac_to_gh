libpari-gmp is a dependency of many packages, so it's important to be able to use the one from the system.

We check that system's PARI/GP environment is close enough to what we would install in Sage (i.e. versions of GP and libpari, and that they share the datadir). Also, PARI packages need to be checked.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
we should use sample GP commands to test for packages, as in https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html:

```
  ellinit("11a1")     /* package: elldata */
  galoisgetpol(8)     /* package: galpol */
  galoisgetname(12,1) /* package: galpol 4.0 and up */
  ellmodulareqn(11)   /* package: seadata */
  polgalois(x^8-2)    /* package: galdata */
```

if only the small version of `seadata` is installed, `ellmodulareqn(211)` produces an error (it does work with the "normal" `seadata` version).


need to figure out how to test for `nftables`.

The following may be used to test whether libpari knows about `galdata`
(Basically, obtained by editing the output of `gp2c` run on `polygalois(x^8-2)[1]`).

```C
#include <pari/pari.h>  /* cc t.c -lpari && ./a.out */
GEN t_t(long prec)
{
  GEN x = pol_x(fetch_user_var("x"));
  return gel(polgalois(gsubgs(gpowgs(x, 8), 2), prec), 1);
}

int main() 
{
GEN r;
pari_init(5000000, 0);
r=t_t(100);
pari_printf("group order=%P4d\n", r); /* should be 16 */
pari_close();
return 0;
}
```

For installing gp2c, one must provide pari.cfg location, something that it's not really discoverable. (save for `find / -name pari.cfg` :-))

It seems that all the PARI package "deps" should be checked within spkg-configure of PARI itself (as PARI does not provide means to install extra packages, we need to disable system PARI lacking these packages). -- the branch does not yet implement this.

And not only standard packages pari_galdata and
pari_seadata_small, but also the optional packages pari_elldata, 
pari_galpol, and pari_seadata.

The optional package pari_nftables is clearly an afterthought (not used anywhere in sagelib, too), and I don't want to rule out an otherwise OK installation of PARI/GP, is it is missing (e.g. Debian doesn't even ship it, although Fedora does ship it; not sure about Conda and Gentoo).

pari_jupyter should be installable regardless.

gp2c only needs the correct location of `pari.cfg`, and while it's a pain to find it, it is doable in some ad hoc way. I wonder what Conda does does with gp2c, and where it places `pari.cfg`.

Distros have a bone to pick with the data packages from pari. That may be why some distro decided not to bother. There are ways to install the stuff manually if you want too.

Upstream is committing the cardinal sin of not versioning their data packages. The tarball is always called exactly the same - even when the content is changed. You understand that's a bit of a problem for automated build scripts that rely on a stored checksum to verify that the package is authentic.

For info, I had the stuff packaged in Gentoo and I recently updated it.

I'm trying to convince the upstream to make configuration info for libpari discoverable.
E.g. there is no way to get the location of `pari.cfg` from `gp`. I'm thinking of getting its location from the full path to `libpari.so`, I see no other good way...

Is there a way to avoid checking for the optional packages? Maybe build PARI from SPKG if the optional package is not found, but requested.

I just packaged all the optional PARI database packages on conda including nftables.

Conda puts it into `<prefix>/lib/pari/pari.cfg`. We don't package `gp2c` yet.

I was working on FreeBSD with 9.1.beta9 and pari as a system package without any problem related to gp / pari.

Yesterday I switched to 9.1.rc1, with the same external package, and now the compilation of cysignals aborts with this message:

Anyone with the same problem on other OS, or is it specific to FreeBSD?

I mean to say that we can use Pari built with `--enable-tls` with Sage on several Linux distributions (not the Pari built by Sage). Does FreeBSD Pari port use some special clang flags for TLS? 

Is Pari built with pthread on FreeBSD?

On the other hand, `cysignals` is not known to be thread-safe, so it could be that FreeBSD tools are better than Linux tools in detecting this:
https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/issues/21

In view of this, linking `cysignals` with `-pthreads` might be what causes this error.

Actually the problem was different! Pari's spkg-configure.m4 is broken: I thought that I was using pari from the system packages, but I was not.

spkg-configure.m4 includes unescaped [ ] and it produces an error.

A fix could be:

however, this still begs a question why cysignals is built with `-pythread` (as set in its setup.py), while it's known not to be thread-safe, cf.
