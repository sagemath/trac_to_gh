```
    sage: alarm(1.0)
    sage: z2 = QQbar.polynomial_root(p4, ival)

Should I increase to 5?

Did you try running it on a raspberry pi, for example? I understand why you would want to test for speed regressions, but this isn't a good way of doing it.  

The doctest framework has already an overall speed factor of the machine, collected from previous runs. It is used for the "slow doctest" warning. At the very least this shoud be taken into account. For failed tests it should also display the actual time taken, not just crash in an AlarmInterrupt.

Of course I did not check on raspberry pi. How should I test for speed regression then? The only framework available are doctests. The only purpose of #17895 was to speed up execution. There is nothing changed from an input/output point of view.

It's not just problematic when testing on a raspberry pi. For example our (nixos) buildservers rebuild and retest sage regularly. Sometimes the build servers may be under heavy load. Then a test can take an excessive amount of time, but it should not fail (which would fail the whole sage package).

Performance regressions are hard to measure, although worthwhile. But they should be tested entirely separately from the functionality tests.

So as a summary, I propose to remove the alarm completely. If I put my laptop in suspend in the middle of running the test suite and wake it up again an hour later, the test suite should still pass. If we want to keep performance tests in the main test suite, they should at least be behind an optional flag so they are disable-able.
