I don't feel qualified enough to be able to answer this as it is not my area of expertise. I might be able to grab a geometer to check it, but I cannot promise that. I can say at least the changes are code-wise correct.

Eric, this is essentially a trivial ticket, can you quickly check it?

The description should be correct now. The names are chosen quite general. Still, I feel not comfortable reviewing my own modifications.

If you could grab a geometer, it would be certainly nice. But I think this is not necessary. I could ask my supervisor next week and modify the documentation at some later point if necessary. 

However, the term 'genus' is certainly wrong and it would be nice not having this into the final Sage version.
