There are several editor specific files listed in .gitignore (i.e. PyCharm .idea, Eclipse .project, Sublime .sublime-workspace), but excluded from this list is VSCode's .vscode editor file.

This change just adds .vscode to the .gitignore file. This is a very small change.

I mostly just use it for ease of navigation / familiarity, pylint and other python plugins aren't very helpful at all for such a large project (can't keep track of names across modules very well, for example). The git interface is super helpful for things like merge conflicts
