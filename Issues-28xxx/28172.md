Add methods profile and profile_series (= profile_polynomial) in category finite_permutation_groups, in order to be able to compute the orbital profile, and its generating series/polynomial, of a finite permutation group. 

(The profile of G maps any non negative integer n onto the number of G-orbits of n-subsets, for the induced action of G on all subsets of its domain.)

Yup, with the caveat that if a subclass overrides profile_polynomial, profile_series will still point to the one here.

- "If you are worried about someone changing `profile_polynomial`, it is still an issue in the way it is written right now."  
  --> I was told differently indeed; anyway, I think it is clearer with 
  an alias for now, so I changed it.

- I checked the useless spaces, it should be ok.

- "I don't know how to do it efficiently, but I am wondering if it really
  is a good idea to compute the whole polynomial just to get one coefficient
  in `profile`. If there is a faster way to do it, especially when the group
  is big, please change the code."
  --> There is indeed a more direct method, although I would call it the 
   "naive" method since I am not sure it is really faster than Polyà 
   enumeration, which presents in addition the bonus of computing all
   values of the profile in a row. I added nevertheless an optional argument 
   to allow the user to use their preferred method. This can also make what
   the profile is clearer to the user !
