An important feature is to still be able to handle old `.sws` worksheets because a lot of pedagogical material was written on that format. 

With the removal of sagenb, also `sws2rst` disappeared, see #30076 and related tickets.

We extract and translate the required material from `sagenb` to a new optional package `sage_sws2rst` that makes `sage -sws2rst` work. 


As of this ticket, the source code of `sage_sws2rst` is in `build/pkgs/sage_sws2rst/src`, which is a pip-installable Python package; and one can build an sdist from there, for example using the `spkg-src` script. The source tree could as well be split out to a separate repository.

It would be good to add a few test documents to the package.

This gives `rst` files which are quite useful for e.g. adding to Sage documentation.  That was some of the main use before.

Is this basically Pablo's stuff modified for Py3?  It looks like it's a required package, is that correct?

I don't know. I just moved files around that were on this ticket already.

Jupiter's nbconvert provides conversion to rst. https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Thus, once sws is converted to jupyter, one can convert further, and the package created here is not needed.

I added one of the test worksheets from Karl-Dieter.

After `sage -i tox`, the code can now be tested with it using 

```
./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sage_sws2rst/src && tox -v -v)'
```
It will need adjustments for python 3 and for the beautifulsoup 3->4 upgrade.
Currently it fails as follows:

```
  File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/build/pkgs/sage_sws2rst/src/.tox/python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage_sws2rst/comments2rst.py", line 146, in replace_latex

Doing `sage -sws2rst CIRM_Tutorial_1.sws` creates a rst file with still a *lot* of html stuff. Is it normal? or beautiful soup does not eat the soup well?

Also doing `rst2html.py CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst` gives lots of warning of the kind

```
CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst:83: (WARNING/2) Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
...
```

because a line is missing. More precisely

```
.. end of output
<html><head></head><body></body></html>
```

should be better as:

```
.. end of output

<html><head></head><body></body></html>
```

I wrote the rst2txt and rst2sws long time ago, but sws2rst is more work (parsing html is so fun). The sws2rst script was written thanks to Pablo Angulo at the time. Let me try to spend some (limited) time on it.

Question: how does the `sage -n export` work? does it go through rst?

This now looks much better with no html code in the generated rst file. For example:

```
$ wget http://slabbe.org/Sage/2010-perpignan/CIRM_Tutorial_1.sws
$ sage -sws2rst CIRM_Tutorial_1.sws
Processing CIRM_Tutorial_1.sws
File at CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst
Image directory at CIRM_Tutorial_1_media
$ rst2html.py CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst CIRM_Tutorial_1.html
CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst:182: (WARNING/2) Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst:269: (WARNING/2) Inline strong start-string without end-string.
CIRM_Tutorial_1.rst:343: (WARNING/2) Inline strong start-string without end-string.
$ open CIRM_Tutorial_1.html 
```

The above means few ReStructuredText syntax errors are present in the generated rst file...

Also, it now looks like `.. end of output` is followed by more than one empty lines now. So let me remove the new lines I added few commits before.

Ok, so, to me, this is good enough. The remaining issues are neglectable and easy to fix by hand by the user knowing ReStructuredText syntax.

I give a positive review to all commits before mines.

Few commits I did today now need review.

Question: is `sage -t --optional=sage,beautifulsoup build/pkgs/sage_sws2rst/src/sage_sws2rst/` going to be tested by the normal `sage -t -a`? (i'm not used with these kind of optional but included packages)

Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make sage_sws2rst'):

* package:         sage_sws2rst-none
  last build time: sept. 6 22:09

Same thing if I run `SAGE_CHECK=yes make sage_sws2rst`. Why does it `failed to source`?

```diff

then I am able to `make sage_sws2rst`. But then `SAGE_CHECK=yes make sage_sws2rst` fails with

Good. `make sage_sws2rst` works and `SAGE_CHECK=yes make sage_sws2rst` now gives:

It is true, that sometimes it does not translates the html properly. For instance, the following paragraph appears in the file CIRM_Tutorial_3.rst:

```

```

but I am quite sure it was the same problem before. From me it is a positive review.

Let's deal with blockquote and other missing styles in another ticket if somebody finds it desirable.
