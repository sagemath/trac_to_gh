They should not be created when `exact_field()` is called since they might have already been created by some other process. Instead, the p-adic parent should implement `_coerce_map_from_` and the number field `_convert_map_from_` appropriately.

(Creating a relative high-degree number field is extremely slow.) Instead, the exact modulus should be stored in the iterated polynomial quotient ring, i.e., replace the relative number field `K(f(\u03be) = 0)` with the quotient `K[x]/f`. (Arithmetic in the latter is much slower, but we usually don't need to do any arithmetic there, exact maybe in `_create_backend_julian`.)\n- [ ] (construction) Consider to change `construction()` of p-adic parents. Whenever a pushout is created (which e.g. often happens when evaluating a p-adic polynomial at some point) the `construction()` machinery either creates the ring of integers or creates the push out given by the algebraic extension underlying a p-adic parent. This can be extremely slow, and even worse often the attempt to form such a pushout leads to a recursive cascade of all kinds of p-adic extension rings and fields being constructed. It is unclear what should be done here exactly to improve upon this but maybe there is a better functor that describes a general extension (it's not CompletionFunctor at the exact field since constructing the exact field takes forever.)\n- [ ] (integer_ring) Make sure that `integer_ring()` and `fraction_field()` of general extensions are fast.

However, in practice they sometimes lead to a cascade of extensions being created.\n- [ ] (extension) Ensure that `.extension()` does not call itself recursively more than necessary. Naturally, `.extension()` needs to call `.extension()` to create backend extension field. However, we should try to make sure that no accidental calls to `.extension()` happen as they often happen when pushouts are created. How to ensure this is completely unclear at the moment but this tends to make things relatively slow in some cases.\n- [ ] (implementation) What is the meaning of the `implementation=` keyword of a general extension ring? Should the backend be created with this implementation? Currently, that keyword is ignored.\n- [ ] (segfault) Fix segfaults. In calls to `CoercionModel.bin_op()`, sometimes the refcount to the parameters goes wrong. As a result, an object that should still be referenced is released and then things go terribly wrong (a p-adic element changes its type to an AttributeError, a method, then a weakref.) Why exactly this happens is currently unclear. However, we found that changing `bin_op` from `cpdef` to `def` fixes the problem (https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/TQQka02k8dI.) It appears to us now that this is a bug in the code generation of Cython but maybe we're doing something wrong somewhere else. However, we can not see how this could possibly related to the p-adics changes we are making. So why are we only seeing this bug now? Apparently, due to the `construction()` of p-adic parents, finding a pushout/action sometimes becomes recursive cyling back to the original parent.

```markdown
Implement extensions of p-adic fields with arbitrary base and (irreducible) defining polynomial using Xavier's `RingExtension` classes.

Things we're putting off until later (when there are references in `(parens)` below, then there is a corresponding `TODO: (see Merge Request 32 - parens)` in the source code.):

- [ ] Check that the rest of SageMath does not assume that all p-adic elements inherit from `pAdicGenericElement`. (Due to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4646, the general extension elements cannot inherit from `pAdicGeneralElement` and `RingExtensionElement` at the same time since they are both Cython classes. We did not really want any of the `pAdicGenericElement` methods since we almost always want to call through to the backend, so we decided to inherit from `RingExtensionElement`. However, some code might assume that all p-adic elements satisfy that `isinstance(x, pAdicGenericElement)`.)
- [ ] (krasner) Implement Krasner check to make sure that the exact defining polynomial describes a unique extension. See https://github.com/MCLF/henselization/blob/master/henselization/sage/rings/padics/henselization/henselization.py#L225 for an existing implementation.
- [ ] Make sure we have complete coverage.
- [ ] **TODO: Rewrite this task**: Implement `square_root`, `sqrt` and fix NotImplementedError("extending using the sqrt function not yet implemented")
- [ ] **TODO: Rewrite this task**: Implement `nth_root` and add extend parameter
- [ ] Add generic test methods such as `_test_trivial_powers`, `_test_expansions`, …
- [ ] Time conversions/coercions between ZZ, QQ, residue fields, p-adic rings. (We have touched quite a bit of the conversion/coercion code so we should make sure that we did not break performance of any of these, also for the old p-adic rings.)
- [ ] (coercions) Make sure conversions/coercions from/to the exact number field are working.
