(Creating a relative high-degree number field is extremely slow.) Instead, the exact modulus should be stored in the iterated polynomial quotient ring, i.e., replace the relative number field `K(f(\u03be) = 0)` with the quotient `K[x]/f`.

Whenever a pushout is created (which e.g. often happens when evaluating a p-adic polynomial at some point) the `construction()` machinery either creates the ring of integers or creates the push out given by the algebraic extension underlying a p-adic parent. This can be extremely slow, and even worse often the attempt to form such a pushout leads to a recursive cascade of all kinds of p-adic extension rings and fields being constructed. It is unclear what should be done here exactly to improve upon this but maybe there is a better functor that describes a general extension (it's not CompletionFunctor at the exact field since constructing the exact field takes forever.)\n- [ ] (integer_ring) Make sure that `integer_ring()` and `fraction_field()` of general extensions are fast.

Naturally, `.extension()` needs to call `.extension()` to create backend extension field. However, we should try to make sure that no accidental calls to `.extension()` happen as they often happen when pushouts are created.

Why exactly this happens is currently unclear. However, we found that changing `bin_op` from `cpdef` to `def` fixes the problem (https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/TQQka02k8dI.) It appears to us now that this is a bug in the code generation of Cython but maybe we're doing something wrong somewhere else. However, we can not see how this could possibly related to the p-adics changes we are making. So why are we only seeing this bug now? Apparently, due to the `construction()` of p-adic parents, finding a pushout/action sometimes becomes recursive cyling back to the original parent. This throws a CoercionException in `_register_pair`. This probably rarely happens in other parts of SageMath.\n- [ ] Replace (or delete) padics/README.txt.\n```\n\n\nDepends on #26105\n\nDepends on #28481\n\nDepends on #21413\n\n**Keywords:** padicBordeaux\n\n**Branch:** [u/caruso/general-extensions](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/u/caruso/general-extensions)\n\n**Commit:** [68ad52759e79087e637c0584a8205e7250a71963](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/68ad52759e79087e637c0584a8205e7250a71963)\n\n**Author:** David Roe, Julian R\u00fcth, Xavier Caruso\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28466\n\n",

Implement extensions of p-adic fields with arbitrary base and (irreducible) defining polynomial using Xavier's `RingExtension` classes.

Things we're putting off until later (when there are references in `(parens)` below, then there is a corresponding `TODO: (see Merge Request 32 - parens)` in the source code.):

- [ ] Check that the rest of SageMath does not assume that all p-adic elements inherit from `pAdicGenericElement`. (Due to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4646, the general extension elements cannot inherit from `pAdicGeneralElement` and `RingExtensionElement` at the same time since they are both Cython classes. We did not really want any of the `pAdicGenericElement` methods since we almost always want to call through to the backend, so we decided to inherit from `RingExtensionElement`. However, some code might assume that all p-adic elements satisfy that `isinstance(x, pAdicGenericElement)`.)
- [ ] (krasner) Implement Krasner check to make sure that the exact defining polynomial describes a unique extension. See https://github.com/MCLF/henselization/blob/master/henselization/sage/rings/padics/henselization/henselization.py#L225 for an existing implementation.
- [ ] Make sure we have complete coverage.
- [ ] **TODO: Rewrite this task**: Implement `square_root`, `sqrt` and fix NotImplementedError("extending using the sqrt function not yet implemented")
- [ ] **TODO: Rewrite this task**: Implement `nth_root` and add extend parameter
- [ ] Add generic test methods such as `_test_trivial_powers`, `_test_expansions`, …
- [ ] Time conversions/coercions between ZZ, QQ, residue fields, p-adic rings. (We have touched quite a bit of the conversion/coercion code so we should make sure that we did not break performance of any of these, also for the old p-adic rings.)
