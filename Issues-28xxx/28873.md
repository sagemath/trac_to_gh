We implement the ambient volume using backend normaliz.

This is done by return 0 or infinity if the polyhedron is not full-dimensional and not compact respectively.

Otherwise, we take the `induced_lattice` volume and divide by `factorial(self.dim())`.

See section 6.1.1 of the normaliz manual on how `induced_lattice` volume relates to euclidean volume: [https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf](https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf)

This is much faster than the current method, so we set this to default if backend is normaliz.

```
sage: P = polytopes.dodecahedron(backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 3.91 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.91 ms
Wall time: 1.49 ms
-176*sqrt5 + 400
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 26.5 ms, sys: 332 µs, total: 26.9 ms
Wall time: 27.5 ms
-176*sqrt5 + 400
```

```
sage: P = polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 1.5 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.5 s
Wall time: 210 ms
120*sqrt5
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 8.61 s, sys: 14.7 ms, total: 8.63 s
Wall time: 8.63 s
120*sqrt5
```

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(6, backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 2.33 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.33 ms
Wall time: 2.34 ms
64
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 183 ms, sys: 32 µs, total: 183 ms
Wall time: 182 ms
64
```

This also speeds up calculation in case the polyhedron is not full-dimensional:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6, backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(measure='induced')
CPU times: user 37.7 s, sys: 42.4 ms, total: 37.7 s
Wall time: 24.2 s
1296*sqrt(6)
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal', measure='induced')
CPU times: user 42.9 s, sys: 71.9 ms, total: 43 s
Wall time: 41.8 s
1296*sqrt(6)
```

However, note that calculation of the affine hull takes quite some time in this case. So we leave the inexact normaliz option for now:

```
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz', measure='induced')
CPU times: user 710 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 710 ms
Wall time: 92.3 ms
3174.5387066469984
```

Possible follow ups:

There is probably a good and fast way to convert the lattice volume to the euclidean volume exactly. Also, once we can set up a normaliz polyhedron with both Vrep and Hrep, affine hull should be really quick.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Is the following "unimodual" a typo? Is unimodular meant?

```diff
+        One other possibility is to compute the scaled volume where a unimodual
```

There is also

```diff
+        volume of the unimodal simplex (or zero if not full-dimensional)::
```

Unimodular?

Could you check if this occurs in the rest of the file too?

Otherwise, the ticket looks good and the bots are green on 9.1rc0, so you can put this on positive review on my behalf once you considered the above comments.
