<div id="comment:0"></div>

When you pass `degree=0` to the `PolynomialRing` `random_element()` method, it short-circuits and gives you back an element of the base ring rather than an element of the polynomial ring:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'X,Y,Z')
sage: type(R.random_element(degree=0))
<class 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
```

This means that you need special cases in all of your algorithms, because that random element won't have an `lt()` method, for example. I think it's an easy fix to wrap that ring element in `self()`, so long as nothing else breaks as a result.

I guess it was easy, unless I come back in a few hours to report that ptestlong threw up.
