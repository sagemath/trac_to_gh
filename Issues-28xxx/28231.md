lrcalc is available in Debian (`lrcalc` and `liblrcalc-dev`) and in Fedora (`lrcalc-devel`)

On Fedora one also needs to run "module load lrcalc-x86_64" to add the location of `rlcalc` binaries to PATH, although it appears to be not important, as only the dylib of lrcalc is used in Sage.

I'll change the installation documentation (per distro) on lrcalc on #28224, to minimise hard to merge small changes to the same file...

By the way, is lrcalc available on Conda?
