When building the documentation on a system

* whose locale uses commas as a decimal separator (in the tested case `LC_NUMERIC="fr_FR.UTF-8"`); and
* where jmol is not available (for instance if java is not installed),

tachyon, which is used to produced images of 3d objects for the documentation when jmol is not available, returns a syntax error. The error is caused by the presence of float numbers with commas (instead of dots) in the input string of tachyon. Curiously this bug seems to only happen when building the doc. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/peTGEjzS2eA .

This ticket fixes the bug by setting the locale before producing plots for the documentation.

Keywords: tachyon syntax error locale documentation

Could this have issues if the `en_US.UTF-8` locale is unavailable? Would it be better to set `LC_ALL=C`?

Yes, you are right.
I fixed it in a new commit (I set `LC_NUMERIC` to `'C'`). No problem building the documentation on my system after this change.

Answering my own question: I can't seem to reproduce the problem outside the docbuild, even after confirming that I have `os.environ['LC_NUMERIC'] == 'fr_FR.UTF-8'`.  The question though is *why*?
