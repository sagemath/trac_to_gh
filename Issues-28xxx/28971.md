When building the documentation on a system

* whose locale uses commas as a decimal separator (in the tested case `LC_NUMERIC="fr_FR.UTF-8"`); and
* where jmol is not available (for instance if java is not installed),

tachyon, which is used to produced images of 3d objects for the documentation when jmol is not available, returns a syntax error. The error is caused by the presence of float numbers with commas (instead of dots) in the input string of tachyon. Curiously this bug seems to only happen when building the doc. See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/peTGEjzS2eA .

This ticket fixes the bug by setting the locale before producing plots for the documentation.

Can this problem be reproduced outside the doc build?  Or is it a more general problem?  I think it seems strange to try to fix this just in the doc build.

Answering my own question: I can't seem to reproduce the problem outside the docbuild, even after confirming that I have `os.environ['LC_NUMERIC'] == 'fr_FR.UTF-8'`.  The question though is *why*?
