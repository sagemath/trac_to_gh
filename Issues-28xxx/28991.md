Attachment: **[spkg-configure.m4.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket28991/spkg-configure.m4.gz)**

With the attached spkg-configure.m4, it works for me on FreeBSD, and Sage uses the system package.

Note: ATM the FreeBSD system package is at v.8.0.4 (boehm-gc-threaded-8.0.4_1), and the pkg-config file is named bdw-gc-threaded.pc - this might be different on other systems.

also on Debian and Fedora it is `bdw-gc`.

- on Debian on needs to install `libgc-dev`
- on Fedora one needs to install `gc gc-devel`

as can be seen on the GH Action logs from https://github.com/dimpase/sage/actions/runs/207790649 libgc is correctly recongnised - if it can be installed

On macOS Conda, libgc is not found:
