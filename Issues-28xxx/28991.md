With the attached spkg-configure.m4, it works for me on FreeBSD, and Sage uses the system package.

Note: ATM the FreeBSD system package is at v.8.0.4 (boehm-gc-threaded-8.0.4_1), and the pkg-config file is named bdw-gc-threaded.pc - this might be different on other systems.

Replying to [mjo](#comment%3A4):
> It's `bdw-gc.pc` on Gentoo at least, so we should check that name too.

also on Debian and Fedora it is `bdw-gc`.

- on Debian on needs to install `libgc-dev`
- on Fedora one needs to install `gc gc-devel`
