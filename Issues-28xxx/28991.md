With the attached spkg-configure.m4, it works for me on FreeBSD, and Sage uses the system package.

Note: ATM the FreeBSD system package is at v.8.0.4 (boehm-gc-threaded-8.0.4_1), and the pkg-config file is named bdw-gc-threaded.pc - this might be different on other systems.

Replying to [mjo](#comment%3A4):

also on Debian and Fedora it is `bdw-gc`.

- on Debian on needs to install `libgc-dev`

LGTM, but can you just delete those conda.txt files rather than comment out their contents? If I'm looking for packages that need Gentoo information, I'm going to be checking for the existence of `distros/gentoo.txt` and assume that it's correct if present.
