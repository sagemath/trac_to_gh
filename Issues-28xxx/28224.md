Debian and Fedora package lcalc (Fedora calls the package `L-function-devel`). On Debian one needs packages `liblfunction-dev` and `lcalc`.

One needs to check how well-patched they are.

We had to introduce an env. var. `SAGE_LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX` to deal with the discrepancy in the include names, which is `libLfunction/` on sage-dist, but `Lfunction/` on Debian.

if `SAGE_LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX` is not `''` then we assume that 
the include prefix is  `Lfunction/`, and otherwise it is
`libLfunction/`.

sage-dist, conda, arch installs the header as `<prefix>/include/libLfunction/L.h` while debian installs it as `<prefix>/include/Lfunction/L.h`.

You'll need more changes to make lcalc work with Debian way. For eg: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_sage.h#L1

The latest commit fixes a weird build bug I was getting.
Namely, if `LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX==''` the build was failing.
So I made it to always be something non-empty and OK for gcc (7 and 8.3, neither worked).

Needs final review now.

Running configure < setting env variables < not having to do anything

So using an env variable with a sane fallback is best.

I mean "not having to do anything when building sagelib on Arch"

I mean a reasonable behavior out of the box when the variable is unset. (ie. if some distro renames the header dir or the lib name, not setting the variable should use the upstream name)
