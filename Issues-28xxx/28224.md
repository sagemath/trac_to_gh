Debian and Fedora package lcalc (Fedora calls the package `L-function-devel`). On Debian one needs packages `liblfunction-dev` and `lcalc`.

One needs to check how well-patched they are.

We had to introduce an env. var. `SAGE_LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX` to deal with the discrepancy in the include names, which is `libLfunction/` on sage-dist, but `Lfunction/` on Debian.

if `SAGE_LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX` is not `''` then we assume that 
the include prefix is  `Lfunction/`, and otherwise it is
`libLfunction/`.

The latest commit fixes a weird build bug I was getting.
Namely, if `LCALC_INCDIR_NOLIBPREFIX==''` the build was failing.
So I made it to always be something non-empty and OK for gcc (7 and 8.3, neither worked).

Needs final review now.

As long as there's a fallback that allows not having to set the variable I'm fine with it - I can change the lcalc package headers accordingly.

Running configure < setting env variables < not having to do anything

So using an env variable with a sane fallback is best.
