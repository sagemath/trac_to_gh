the current version is buggy, as we found out on #27870

also, pkgconfig switched to https://python-poetry.org/ from setuptools, so we either get poetry installed too (which is a big task), or go Debian way and provide `setup.py`. That's what they do in their (not really "orig") tarball on

http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-pkgconfig/

Cf. https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/modules/python-pkgconfig/tree/master

The pypi tarball has setup.py, so we can just use it.

[ After re-checking the setup... ] This doesn't seem to be effective. I still get the systemwide pkg-config:

```
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ git status
Sur la branche t/28883/packages/pkgconfig151
Votre branche est à jour avec 'trac/u/dimpase/packages/pkgconfig151'.

rien à valider, la copie de travail est propre
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-9

this is a Python interface to pkg-config.
So you need to `import pkgconfig` in Sage's Python to see it in action.

Yes, it could also be that local/lib/pkgconfig/ contents are somehow broken and thus
break Python's pkgconfig.

Was it a build from scratch? If not, stale things in local/lib/pkgconfig/  may break stuff.

On Catalina, there is no zlib in /usr/lib/pkgconfig and we don't build our own zlib with #27870.

```
buildbot-sage@osx build % ./sage -sh -c 'pkgconf --cflags zlib'

Package zlib was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `zlib.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'zlib', required by 'world', not found
```
All builds from scratch.

No, #27870 is fine.

what's "borked" is that the new pkgconfig v1.5.1 throws an error if there is no `.pc` file. E.g. on this branch one sees

```
sage: import pkgconfig
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")

    104 
    105 

PackageNotFoundError: uhohoh not found
sage: 
```

but the previous version merrily returns some stuff:

```
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")
defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'define_macros': []})
```

All the systems this was tested apparently had `zlib.pc` somewhere, and so it worked.
Your box does not have it, and so an error is thrown.

OK, would it be easier if this is fixed (trivially) on a followup ticket rather than here?

The whole thing about assuming that `zlib.pc` exists was iffy since #26286 - that's basically where the bug has slipped in. 

It "worked" as the absense of `zlib.pc` was ignored by old Python's `pkgconfig`. 

There is no actual need to insist on `zlib.pc` present, as Apple's implementation of zlib is good enough to be used.

Indeed its never actually necessary to have .pc files you can always kludge it by hand and fudge cflags/libs on all supported platforms. Its just not a sane/maintainable/scalable system of working with shared libraries.

If you want to save OSX users from having to build zlib then we should just provide an appropriate zlib.pc on that particular snowflake of a platform.

Sage's Python has to dig up `zlib.pc` to read by `pkgconfig.parse()`, from somewhere.

By the way, I don't understand  `pkgconf` in `./sage -sh -c 'pkgconf --cflags zlib` ???

it should be `pkg-config` 

I guess `pkgconf` is some "unofficial" name for `pkg-config`, used by Sage's `pkgconf` package, which installs `pkg-config`.
