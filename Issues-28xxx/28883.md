> [ A stupidity. Sorry for the noise ... ]


[ After re-checking the setup... ] This doesn't seem to be effective. I still get the systemwide pkg-config:

```
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ git status
Sur la branche t/28883/packages/pkgconfig151
Votre branche est à jour avec 'trac/u/dimpase/packages/pkgconfig151'.

rien à valider, la copie de travail est propre
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-9
(sage-sh) charpent@zen-book-flip:sage-9$ command -v pkg-config

So you need to `import pkgconfig` in Sage's Python to see it in action.

Yes, it could also be that local/lib/pkgconfig/ contents are somehow broken and thus
break Python's pkgconfig.

Was it a build from scratch? If not, stale things in local/lib/pkgconfig/  may break stuff.

On Catalina, there is no zlib in /usr/lib/pkgconfig and we don't build our own zlib with #27870.

```
buildbot-sage@osx build % ./sage -sh -c 'pkgconf --cflags zlib'

Package zlib was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `zlib.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'zlib', required by 'world', not found
```
All builds from scratch.

No, #27870 is fine.

what's "borked" is that the new pkgconfig v1.5.1 throws an error if there is no `.pc` file. E.g. on this branch one sees

```
sage: import pkgconfig
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PackageNotFoundError                      Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")

/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pkgconfig/pkgconfig.py in parse(packages, static)
    246     """
    247     for package in packages.split():
--> 248         _raise_if_not_exists(package)
    249 
    250     out = _query(packages, *_build_options('--cflags --libs', static=static))

/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pkgconfig/pkgconfig.py in _raise_if_not_exists(package)
    101 def _raise_if_not_exists(package):
    102     if not exists(package):
--> 103         raise PackageNotFoundError(package)
    104 
    105 

PackageNotFoundError: uhohoh not found
sage: 
```

but the previous version merrily returns some stuff:

```
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")
defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'define_macros': []})
```

All the systems this was tested apparently had `zlib.pc` somewhere, and so it worked.
Your box does not have it, and so an error is thrown.

OK, would it be easier if this is fixed (trivially) on a followup ticket rather than here?

The whole thing about assuming that `zlib.pc` exists was iffy since #26286 - that's basically where the bug has slipped in. 

It "worked" as the absense of `zlib.pc` was ignored by old Python's `pkgconfig`. 

There is no actual need to insist on `zlib.pc` present, as Apple's implementation of zlib is good enough to be used.

Sage's Python has to dig up `zlib.pc` to read by `pkgconfig.parse()`, from somewhere.

By the way, I don't understand  `pkgconf` in `./sage -sh -c 'pkgconf --cflags zlib` ???

it should be `pkg-config` 

I guess `pkgconf` is some "unofficial" name for `pkg-config`, used by Sage's `pkgconf` package, which installs `pkg-config`.
