CC:  @kiwifb @embray @tobihan @infinity0 @isuruf @mkoeppe

the current version is buggy, as we found out on #27870

also, pkgconfig switched to https://python-poetry.org/ from setuptools, so we either get poetry installed too (which is a big task), or go Debian way and provide `setup.py`. That's what they do in their (not really "orig") tarball on

http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-pkgconfig/

Cf. https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/modules/python-pkgconfig/tree/master

The pypi tarball has setup.py, so we can just use it.
tarball: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6e/a9/ff67ef67217dfdf2aca847685fe789f82b931a6957a3deac861297585db6/pkgconfig-1.5.1.tar.gz

I found adding `setup.py` into the "orig" tarball rather than into debian/patches rather unusual.

That `poetry` stuff is really a replacement for `pip`. And from where I see it, it can only fully replace superficially simple `setup.py` files. And it probably can generate such simple `setup.py` file, although I cannot see that in the Readme. And to be able to do what it does, it must be able to process complicated `setup.py` just fine, since it will install stuff that was never prepared for poetry if I am not mistaken.

Anyway that's outside of the scope of the ticket. But one more of this things to potentially deal with :(

[ After re-checking the setup... ] This doesn't seem to be effective. I still get the systemwide pkg-config:

```
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ git status
Sur la branche t/28883/packages/pkgconfig151
Votre branche est à jour avec 'trac/u/dimpase/packages/pkgconfig151'.

rien à valider, la copie de travail est propre
charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-9$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-9
(sage-sh) charpent@zen-book-flip:sage-9$ command -v pkg-config

(sage-sh) charpent@zen-book-flip:sage-9$ pkg-config --version

Exited Sage subshell.

To me, it looks like a Python with broken zlib module. Nothing to do with pkgconfig.

Yes, it could also be that local/lib/pkgconfig/ contents are somehow broken and thus
break Python's pkgconfig.

Was it a build from scratch? If not, stale things in local/lib/pkgconfig/  may break stuff.

Package zlib was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `zlib.pc'

No, #27870 is fine.

what's "borked" is that the new pkgconfig v1.5.1 throws an error if there is no `.pc` file. E.g. on this branch one sees

```
sage: import pkgconfig
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PackageNotFoundError                      Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-d927c49e8798> in <module>()

    246     """
    247     for package in packages.split():
--> 248         _raise_if_not_exists(package)
    249 
    250     out = _query(packages, *_build_options('--cflags --libs', static=static))

    101 def _raise_if_not_exists(package):
    102     if not exists(package):
--> 103         raise PackageNotFoundError(package)
    104 
    105 

PackageNotFoundError: uhohoh not found
sage: 
```

but the previous version merrily returns some stuff:

```
sage: pkgconfig.parse("uhohoh")
defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'define_macros': []})
```

All the systems this was tested apparently had `zlib.pc` somewhere, and so it worked.
Your box does not have it, and so an error is thrown.

OK, would it be easier if this is fixed (trivially) on a followup ticket rather than here?

The whole thing about assuming that `zlib.pc` exists was iffy since #26286 - that's basically where the bug has slipped in. 

It "worked" as the absense of `zlib.pc` was ignored by old Python's `pkgconfig`. 

There is no actual need to insist on `zlib.pc` present, as Apple's implementation of zlib is good enough to be used.

Sage's Python has to dig up `zlib.pc` to read by `pkgconfig.parse()`, from somewhere.

By the way, I don't understand  `pkgconf` in `./sage -sh -c 'pkgconf --cflags zlib` ???

it should be `pkg-config` 

I guess `pkgconf` is some "unofficial" name for `pkg-config`, used by Sage's `pkgconf` package, which installs `pkg-config`.
