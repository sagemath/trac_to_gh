This ticket changes `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSet` to be lazy in the case where a disjoint union is taken over a lazy family of sets. For this, `__contains__` is implemented in `LazyFamily`.

This started as a discussion in [[#28106 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/28106#comment:15)]. In particular, this will solve the memory issues of the doctests in `sage.combinat.tableau` as `StandardTableaux(50).cardinality()` is more efficient now.

Thank you for the feedback. As far as I can tell, it is an error to subclass `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` and initialize it with something mutable. For example, the following raises a type error when initialized with a list.

```
class Foo(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets):
    def __init__(self, family):
        DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__init__(self, family,
                category=FiniteEnumeratedSets(), facade=True, keepkey=False)

a = Foo([FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3]),
         FiniteEnumeratedSet([4,5,6])])
# ... TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

The reason for this is that `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation` which makes use of caching and therefore needs hashable arguments.

When creating a disjoint union directly (without subclassing) as in `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets([FiniteEnumeratedSet([1])])`, then `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__classcall_private__` asserts that the family is converted to a `Family`. In subclasses, this method is not called during initialization though, so they must ensure that they correctly initialize their super class with a hashable type like family or tuple.

I added a comment about this to the code in order to make this clearer. I also checked that `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__init__` is always called with a family, within the Sage library, which seems to be the case.

**Edit:** The requirement of family being a Family also applies to several other places in `disjoint_union_enumerated_sets` where it is assumed that `_family` supports certain methods.

That the data passed to `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` is hashable is not a requirement of `UniqueRepresentation`. Subclasses, say `S`, are free to pass lists or other mutable things as long as the data that defines `S` uniquely identifies it (which is fully independent, e.g., `Tableaux`). So what you are saying is not quite accurate. In the example you gave, it is using the default input, but what if the input was just an integer `n` and the family became `[range(n)]*n`.

Now I believe it is the subclass's responsibility to know and properly handle what data it passes to its superclass(es). Since nothing within the Sage codebase was relying on that `tuple` call, then we are okay (and it was an undocumented feature, so subject to change without notice). So I think the correct thing to say here is:

```
# Note that family is not copied when it is a finite enumerated sets,
#   thus, any subclass must ensure that it does not mutate this input.

Thanks for fixing this.  I was surprised too when I saw that this code was generating so many subsets up-front but wasn't sure how to fix it.

Regardless, I still think the change in #28106 makes sense to do as well, if anyone wants to give it another look.  I made sure this time that it's working as intended.
