This makes the coercion model of mixed forms more robust against modifications regarding differential forms. For instance: As soon as all differential forms of another mixed form have a coerce map, the mixed form has one too. The same now holds for any algebraic element which is coercible into a single differential form.

At this stage, the method `degree` is used and special cases are handled separately. But notice that not all coercible objects provide this method (symbolic ring). Or conversely, having this method doesn't mean being coercible into a differential form. Hence this invocation is now entirely avoided.

In particular we have:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: Omega = M.mixed_form_algebra()
sage: Omega1 = M.diff_form_module(1)
sage: T01 = M.tensor_field_module((0,1))
sage: Omega1.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
True
```
But at this stage:

```
sage: Omega.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
False
```
**With this ticket:**

```
sage: Omega.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
True
```

 This makes the coercion model of mixed forms more robust against modifications regarding differential forms. For instance: As soon as all differential forms of another mixed form have a coerce map, the mixed form has one too. The same now holds for any algebraic element which is coercible into a single differential form.
 
 At this stage, the method `degree` is used and special cases are handled separately. But notice that not all coercible objects provide this method (symbolic ring). Or conversely, having this method doesn't mean being coercible into a differential form. Hence this invocation is now entirely avoided.
+
+In particular we have:
+
+```
+sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
+sage: Omega = M.mixed_form_algebra()
+sage: Omega1 = M.diff_form_module(1)
+sage: T01 = M.tensor_field_module((0,1))
+sage: Omega1.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
+True
+```
+But at this stage:
+
+```
+sage: Omega.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
+False
+```
+**With this ticket:**
+
+```
+sage: Omega.has_coerce_map_from(T01)
+True
+```
