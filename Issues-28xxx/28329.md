I see this every time I start [SageMath](SageMath):

```
/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/psutil/_pslinux.py:489: RuntimeWarning: 'sin' and 'sout' swap memory stats couldn't be determined and were set to 0
  warnings.warn(msg, RuntimeWarning)
sage: 
```

The warning is displayed when psutil can't gather swap statistics, which in turn happens because my /proc/vmstat pseudo-file is missing "pswpin" and "pswpout" lines. (Why? Who knows.)

We don't need those statistics, however, so it should be possible to hide the warnings.

Indeed, if I understand correctly, according to [ticket:24755#comment:7], this seems to be the case and it is probably harmless:

Yes, it looks to me like that doctest should have been throwing a warning all along.

Nevertheless, I should be more careful when poking global state.

For the record, sage's doctests run in multiple processes.  Sage is single-threaded and threads have nothing to do with this.

Yes and no.  The way Sage's doctest runner handles warnings is actually broken and a bit arbitrary, in part due to #25444#comment:34

If the warning had already been displayed once in the course of testing a single module, it *should not* be displayed again while testing that same module.  But due to that bug in the warnings module, the warning state can get reset and be displayed again when it shouldn't be.

well, this is not true, cf. e.g. #22766 which shows how to crash Sage using the fact that it's not single-threaded :-)

There's only one test in that module, and the module only does one thing. I still think it should be displayed, but I'm not sure it's worth investigating if there are bigger known problems with warnings in doctests. With the new approach, we can at least be reasonably certain I haven't made anything worse.

While the doctests may not be threaded, sage is a library, and we don't know what client code is doing with it -- so the safer the better.

That only affects the REPL; in the tests there are only one thread running.
