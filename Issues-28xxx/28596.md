This behavior originates from #24567, and would be different if we'd gone with Jeroen's suggestion of a less restricted mask on the files than I used.

I wrote at the time:

> this should have no effect on the permissions applied when the files are installed, but I guess it depends in part on the installation mechanism


Which, incidentally was true at the time.  But the part of "depends on the installation mechanism" was also true, and the installation mechanism *did* change after that, in such a way that this did have an effect on the installed files.

So I think the better option here might be to try Jeroen's original suggestion of a less restrictive permission mask on the source tarball's extraction location.
