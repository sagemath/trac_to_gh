Since at least Sage 8.4 deprecation warnings are not visible when issued from Cython code inside a function

```
sage: cython("""from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
....: def f():
....:     deprecation(28500, 'hello')
....: """)
sage: f()    # BUG: no deprecation warning shown!
```
Compare with

```
sage: cython("from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation; deprecation(28500, 'hello')")
/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/misc/cython.py:538: DeprecationWarning: hello
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28500 for details.
  m = cython_import(filename, **kwds)
```
or

```
sage: def f():
....:     deprecation(28500, 'hello')  
sage: f()
/opt/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: hello
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28500 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
```
However the warnings are visible by the doctest runner! As a consequence, even though they are doctest, no user could have seen the two following deprecations
- in `sage/matroids/matroid.pyx`

```
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(2, 3).is_3connected(separation=True)
```
- in `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`

```
sage: M = matrix(2, [2,1,1,1])._invert_unit()
```
(there are 38 cython files with such deprecation)

Here is an example from a Python file that works fine

```
sage: P = Permutations(4)
sage: x = P([3, 2, 4, 1]).has_left_descent(2, mult='l2r')
/opt/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:3: DeprecationWarning: The mult option is deprecated and ignored.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/27467 for details.

I'm not sure how to fix the problem, but the reason things fail is because cython functions don't create a stack frame. The deprecation mechanism tries to raise the warning referring to the stack frame of the call site. That's not there in this case! You can see that things work when you make sure that there is a call frame present:

```
sage: def g():
....:     return f()
....: 
sage: g()
/usr/local/sage/sage-git/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: hello
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28500 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
```
It goes back to the python "warning" system:

```
sage: cython("""
....: from warnings import warn
....: def cyW(s):
....:     warn("test",DeprecationWarning,stacklevel=s)
....: """)
```

```
sage: def pyW(s):
....:     warn("test",DeprecationWarning,stacklevel=s)
```

```
sage: def testW(c,s):
....:     if c=="cython":     
....:         cyW(s)
....:     else:
....:         pyW(s)
```
you'll see that `testW("python",3)` and `test("cython",2)` have the same result (that's at top level) and that `testW("python",4)` and `test("cython",3)` also have the same result (no warning printed, because the stack frame lookup failed). It could be considered a bug in python that `warn(..., stacklevel=...")` fails silently if the give stack level is too high.

I think the fix is that cython's "deprecation" should be a different one from python's; and should reduce its stacklevel by one from the value used in python.

There is also the problem that we shouldn't expect deprecation warnings to work properly when called from cython, but that's going to apply to all warnings.

Tried to keep the changes minimal, to avoid merge conflicts. These are all mentions of "import deprecation" in `.pyx` files, according search_src.

If someone feels the urge to add documentation to `deprecation_cython` ... go ahead!

So ... it turns out `IPython` is a bit to blame for the fact that we're not seeing the warning (meaning, there's no bug in python here). If we override the warning filters that IPython installs we see:

```
sage: cython("from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation\ndef f(): deprecation(28500, 'hello boy')")
sage: warnings.simplefilter("always")
sage: f()
/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2878: DeprecationWarning: hello boy

What happens here is that `IPython` apparently hides warnings that appear to emanate from `IPython` code. Since we refer to the wrong callsite, we normally don't get to see the warning.
