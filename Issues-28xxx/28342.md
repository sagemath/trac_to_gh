these are very straightforward, basically just doing dependencies and version checks. 

`m4ri(e)` are quite stable, and it appears impossibe to distinguish the present version of `m4rie` from the older one. We just rely on the version of `m4ri`, it's dependence, which thankfully has pkg-config support.

If it's only used within `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` it can probably use the `SPKG_NAME` macro.  But I think it's maybe a bit cleaner actually to keep it more independent.

As we should eventually rewrite already done 20 or 30 spkg-configure.4 files using this macro, it's better to minimise the number of places one can make this sort of error...

<a id='comment:15'></a>The m4ri in my (old-ish) Ubuntu is *too* old to otherwise test this.

I had a container with a newer Ubuntu but it seems to have gone away.  I'll set that up again, but in the meantime I think this looks good assuming it works at least on your system.

certainly the new macro should have been a part of sage_spkg_configure() all along, getting rid of one parameter is a step towards this refactoring...
