There was an indentation problem: not due to you, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/fully_packed_loop.html and search for "more examples:". What follows is a long block was indented too much, so it is not highlighted properly. The REFERENCES section at the end is touched by your branch.

This ready for review, right? I'm happy with your branch, so set to positive if you approve of my changes.
