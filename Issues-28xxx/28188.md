Currently, the finite fields arithmetic tables for Meataxe are generated on the fly and stored in `$HOME/.sage/`.

It was [reported](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/zWOWtjha-H0) that in some situations using the MeatAxe backend for matrices over finite fields won't work because the arithmetic tables can neither be found nor created.

This ticket is to solve that problem. Sage uses a fork of MeatAxe anyway (called SharedMeatAxe) maintained by Simon King, and so one potential solution is to fix it in the fork, but in fact the solution proposed in this ticket doesn't change the upstream tarball.

Namely, with this branch, the tables in question are generated at installation time and stored in the Sage ext directory (`$SAGE_SHARE/meataxe` to be precise), rather than per user. This adds 9Mb to the space taken on the disk **once**, rather than up to 9Mb per user.

In the original report, the problem was on CoCalC. From the description, it didn't become clear to me if the users do not have write permission on `DOT_SAGE` (which would explain the problem) or if `DOT_SAGE` is a symbolic link (which perhaps can be troublesome, too).

Currently, the arithmetic tables of (Shared)MeatAxe are sought in `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe`, and are created there when they aren't present. I see the following potential solutions:
1. Instead of using `DOT_SAGE`, use `SAGE_EXT`: The user may not have write permissions, but since MeatAxe can only deal with field sizes less than 255, it would be easy to just create *all* arithmetic tables during package installation (hence, in a situation where write permission is granted and from where all users can read).
2. It is a design choice of upstream MeatAxe to use arithmetic tables on disk, and load them when the current field is changed. But in our fork SharedMeatAxe, we could of course differ. Hence, whenever the current field is changed, we could compute the arithmetic table on the spot. Of course, when during a session different fields are used, it would avoid some overhead to keep all arithmetic tables in memory, and reuse them.
3. In case that symbolic links are to blame (I don't know if they are), just address that problem, but keep the design as it is.

The routine writing/reading the table doesn't invoke fscanf/fprintf, if I understand correctly (at least not directly). It uses fread/fwrite.

In any case, I think the first question to be addressed is whether we do want to keep the tables in memory (and potentially lose time for table creation), or want them permanently stored in a file (and potentially lose time because of a slow disk, and have the trouble with write permission).

It is (I think) required that the tables are created, BEFORE the optional `matrix_gfpn_dense` Cython module is available.

Therefore, I want to trigger creation of the tables using one of the MeatAxe executables. I find `zcv` convenient --- to some extent:
- Let `input` be a file consisting of the single line `matrix field=25 rows=0 cols=0`.
- Then, the command `zcv input output` will create a file called `output` describing an empty matrix in binary format, and will, as a side-effect, create `p025.zzz` in the current directory. Of course I am only interested in the side-effect; the file `output` can safely be deleted.

The question is how to do the above in a loop, where `field=...` runs over all available field sizes. According to [MeatAxe documentation](https://www.mankier.com/1/zcv), `zcv - output` should read the input from stdin, but apparently it doesn't.

Is there a way to pretend that a program such as `zcv` reads input from a file? If not: How do I create the input file using a shell script and apply `zcv` to it without risking to be affected by race conditions?

Thank you! That was exactly what I was looking for.

Before I create a branch: The upstream tarball will not change. But shall the Sage package version be bumped from `1.0` to `1.0.p0`?

The above spkg-install script is supposed to install the MeatAxe executables (including zcv) in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. It DOES install it when the spkg-install script ends before `cd $MTXLIB`.

However, according to the error message, zcv is in fact not installed when it is needed. Why?

On the bright side, `... || sdh_die` works as expected.

Yes, this seems to work!

Shall I move building the documentation to `spkg-postinst` as well? Probably not, as building the docs doesn't depend on the presence of the meataxe executables.

Do you see a way out?

something like

```

(this is from `src/sage/libs/arb/arb.pxd`)
to tell the linker, in this case, to link with `-lgmp -lflint -larb`

Yes. There shall be a **single** location where the value of `MTXLIB` is defined, so that there cannot be an inconsistency.

I don't understand that. Are you saying that on some platforms it will NOT be possible to let `MTXLIB` be defined by Sage as an environment variable? In any case, I was not aware that var uses the env variable when possible.

Every env variable defined in sage-env has the same path set as fallback in env.py, I don't see why this one should be different - the env.py one is just a fallback, if the env variable is defined it will be used.

This is not only useful for distros that don't provide sage-env, but also for using sage as a python library - 'from sage.all import *' does not import the env variables defined in sage-env

I think it doesn't matter whether a system-wide meataxe or the meataxe spkg is used (except that the original `MeatAxe` is clearly inferior to its fork `SharedMeatAxe` and that the Sage wrapper uses some functions that only exist in the fork).

In any case, when a meataxe application or any program using meataxe library functions is executed, it will be needed to use arithmetic tables. When they cannot be found, they will be created.

So, the following implications hold regardless whether spkg-meataxe or system-meataxe is used:
- If the environment variable `MTXLIB` is undefined, meataxe applications will search and potentially write tables to the current directory. If the `extern char*` variable `MtxLibDir` is undefined, meataxe library functions will search and potentially write tables to the current directory.

  => Since we do not want to pollute the user's current directory, we **have to** define both environment and cdef extern variables.
- If the tables already exist at the location pointed at by the variables, we need that the user has read permission. Otherwise, there will be an error.
- If the tables do not already exist, the folder pointed at by the variables needs to exist and the user needs to have write permission. Otherwise. there will be an error.

So, our requirements, regardless what source we take meataxe from, are as follows:
- Sage needs to define one environment and one extern C variable. The former should be in sage-env, the latter in sage.libs.meataxe, I suppose.
- It is not a strict requirement that both variables are equal, but of course it would be nice. In any case, we have to make sure that either
  * the arithmetic tables are present at the given folder (and the user can read them), or
  * the user has write permission at the given folder.
  
  A system wide meataxe wouldn't mind that the folder is inside of the Sage tree.

**Question:** What should we do?

IIUC the difference between this and the current state of the branch is whether MTXLIB is defined or not in sage-env, right? In that case, either way is fine for me - I'm only worried about what happens when sage-env is not imported, and the latest commit in env.py takes care of this.

With the latest commit, we have this:
- If the user exports `MTXLIB` and then installs `meataxe`, then the folder `$MTXLIB` will be created; otherwise a default location is chosen and the folder created.
- If the user exports `MTXLIB` and then starts Sage, then sage.env.MTXLIB will be set accordingly; otherwise, a default location is used.
- Sage will define the `extern char*` variable `MtxLibDir` to comply with sage.env.MTXLIB when sage.meataxe is first imported. That variable is all what we need in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.
- If someone wants to use meataxe applications, then it is not Sage's responsibility to export MTXLIB.

I tested that `sage -f -c meataxe` works and `sage -t src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx` works without error. So, needs review! And I guess it should be verified that meataxe now works in CoCalC.

First of all, it would be good to update the ticket description with the problem that this ticket is trying to solve (I didn't follow all comments in this ticket). After all, it's difficult to review a solution when you don't know what problem it is meant to solve.

Second, why are you not defining `MTXLIB` in `src/bin/sage-env` like other similar environment variables? Then you can just refer to `$MTXLIB` unconditionally in your scripts.

I'd keep `export MTXLIB="$SAGE_SHARE/meataxe"` in `src/bin/sage-env`, as I gather it's needed for running `meataxe` at Sage's shell prompt. No need to break (or not to introduce) this capability with this patch.

What do you mean with "keep"? It's not there and this branch doesn't add it.

The "issue" is CoCalc-specific. It has to to with accessing `$DOTSAGE`. Removing this access, as this patch does, should fix it.

I guess it is "keep" in the sense of "one early commit adds it, so, why did a later commit remove it?".

I just tested what was happening in cocalc.

Apparently the DOT_SAGE folder does not contain a sub-folder `meataxe`. When MeatAxe tries to write tables into the non-existing folder, it just crashes instead of creating it. After I created `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe` manually, things worked.

The stupid thing was that during package installation I created `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe`, which of course doesn't work as soon as one has more than a single user for one Sage installation. Very stupid. VERY.

So, the potential fixes are:
1. Change the upstream SharedMeatAxe tarball so that it creates the folder `$MTX_LIB` when needed.
2. Change sage.libs.meataxe so that `import sage.libs.meataxe` creates the folder when needed.
3. Install all tables in a folder that exists during package installation and can be read by all users. That's what I suggest in the current branch.

Which of these solutions do you prefer?

I prefer 3., because it installs all tables once (spending a well-defined amount of disk space), rather than letting each user created his or her own tables (spending a potentially unlimited amount of disk space)
