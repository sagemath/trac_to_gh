While reviewing #28645, I noticed a couple of problems in the file:

`src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_tate_curve.py`

1- We are always hitting `AttributeError` in the `try` blocks in `def parameter`, `def curve`, and `def _Csquare`, as it should be calling `precision_absolute` instead of `absolute_precision`

2- We should be checking `precision_relative`

3- If one fixes the above, the code would return the items with perhaps more precision than desired.

I have fixed the 3 items
