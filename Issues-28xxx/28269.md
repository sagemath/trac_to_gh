add methods to free_group:
- length
- getitem
- conversion with words

This is very natural that a free group element has a length and behave as a list. Moreover I added conversion from String and to Word.

I need this patch for my train_track package (http://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/thierry.coulbois/train-track/)
