I've seen fork-related problems in the tests of this module before, although this is the first time it's come up again in a while.

They seem to occur because the temporarily generated DLL modules output by `cython()` can end up in an address space that overlaps with some other modules, and then any subsequent `fork()` will fail.

The problem tends to manifest itself, in the test failures, in the form of an error like:

```
EnvironmentError: pkg-config is probably not installed. Could not run pkg-config: OSError(11, 'Resource temporarily unavailable')
```

This is because Python is trying to `fork()` to run the `pkg-config` program, and that fails.  The problem isn't really anything to do with `pkg-config` itself.

Two strange observations:

* It works *most of the time* if I run 

  ```
  ./sage -t --serial --long src/sage/misc/cython.py
  ```
  Which means the tests are not running from a forked process to begin with.  It's still strange though, because running `pkg-config` in the tests still means `fork()` is being called during the serial test run, and not failing.

* It works *some of the time*, or sometimes with at least fewer failures, if I run:

  ```
  ./sage -t --verbose --long src/sage/misc/cython.py
  ```
  This implies to me that there might be some kind of race condition involved, since merely running with the verbose output seems to decrease the chances of failure.

Tangent: why is `--serial` not listed in the options when I run `sage -t -h`? Are there other undocumented Sage doctesting options?
