I've seen fork-related problems in the tests of this module before, although this is the first time it's come up again in a while.

They seem to occur because the temporarily generated DLL modules output by `cython()` can end up in an address space that overlaps with some other modules, and then any subsequent `fork()` will fail.

The problem tends to manifest itself, in the test failures, in the form of an error like:

```
EnvironmentError: pkg-config is probably not installed. Could not run pkg-config: OSError(11, 'Resource temporarily unavailable')
```

This is because Python is trying to `fork()` to run the `pkg-config` program, and that fails.  The problem isn't really anything to do with `pkg-config` itself.

Two strange observations:

* It works *most of the time* if I run 
  {{{
  ./sage -t --serial --long src/sage/misc/cython.py
  }}}
  Which means the tests are not running from a forked process to begin with.  It's still strange though, because running `pkg-config` in the tests still means `fork()` is being called during the serial test run, and not failing.

* It works *some of the time*, or sometimes with at least fewer failures, if I run:
  {{{
  ./sage -t --verbose --long src/sage/misc/cython.py
  }}}
  This implies to me that there might be some kind of race condition involved, since merely running with the verbose output seems to decrease the chances of failure.

The attached branch fixes the problem to my satisfaction.  It can never be fully "fixed" as what we're dealing with here is a fundamental limitation of !Windows/Cygwin.  But we can *mitigate* the problem and this does so well.  See the commit message for more details.
