Both

```
grep -R "import collections.*abc" src/sage src/sage_setup src/doc
```
and

```
grep -R "from collections.*import.*abc" src/sage src/sage_setup src/doc
```
come up empty. I tried turning off the warnings in `src/sage/all.py`, and when I ran a few doctests, I got a warning from `matplotlib`. I don't know what else to try to do to check.

Ok, then we will see later when we upgrade matplotlib.

By the way, do you know "git grep" ? Useful tool, in my opinion. Only search in the files under git control.
