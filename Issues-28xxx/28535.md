```
Usually, the fundamental group of a `SimplicialSet` is returned as a `FinitelyPresentedGroup`:

```
sage: T = simplicial_sets.Torus()
sage: T.fundamental_group()
Finitely presented group < e0, e1 | e0*e1^-1*e0^-1*e1 >
``` 

However, for the case where there is no 1-skeleton, the trivial group is represented as a `GapGroup`:

```
sage: S2 = simplicial_sets.Sphere(2)
sage: S2.fundamental_group()
Group( <identity> of ... )
```

For consistency, it should also be a `FinitelyPresentedGroup`
