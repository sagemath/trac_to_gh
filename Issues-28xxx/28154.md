As originally reported at https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9606 there are a few .py modules in scipy that contain unicode characters in docstrings without supplying a required "coding" line, resulting in a `SyntaxError` when you try to compile them.

Normally this is not a problem, because when you build scipy with its `setup.py` it just compiles all `.pyc` while assuming utf-8 encoding for the source files.  If you already have the `.pyc` file, then, nothing goes wrong because the `SyntaxError` only arises when the Python compiler tries to read the original source file at runtime.

But if for some reason your files' mtimes get messed up (as apparently happened to me at some point; not sure how) and the .pyc has to be regenerated then you'll get a `SyntaxError` at import time for these modules.

For now it should suffice to include the following patch:
