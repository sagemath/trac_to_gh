`sage.numerical.backends` depends on very little from Sage. We propose to split out the optional backends (COIN, CPLEX, Gurobi) to separate Cython packages. 

With this ticket, sagelib no longer has the optional dependency on cbc. Instead, these new packages depend on the `sage` package (i.e., sagelib).

This makes it easier to reconfigure when new solvers are installed, as sagelib does not have to be recompiled. By eliminating the use of the optional extensions mechanisms from sagelib, this will also simplify packaging binary distributions.

The new packages are on PyPI:

```

These backends are used in graphs. So what will happen if linear programming backends are in a separate package ?

 Details:

-Details:
+(In a follow-up ticket, one could consider moving the entire backend machinery to a separate packages. Some notes regarding this:
 - `get_solver` uses base_ring
-- GLPKBackend depends on `sage.libs.glpk`, which should also become a separate Cython package (see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Python for a list of other glpk bindings)
-- For Gurobi and CPLEX, we could alternatively get rid of these Cython modules entirely by making use of their standard Python API instead.

The macOS installer of Gurobi adds the following symlinks:

```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  40 Apr 28  2016 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.env -> //Library/gurobi651/mac64/bin/gurobi.env
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.sh -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi.sh
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi_cl -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi_cl
```

See https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/blob/master/README.md (just updated) - 
I am using gurobi.sh to do all the build configuration. 
Does this work on Linux?

I see, on Linux it's not an installer but just a tgz.

Thanks a lot! I was briefly looking into this before I created the new packages, but was discouraged by various warnings on this page that seemed to imply one needs control of all packages sharing a namespace simultaneously. But I want the packages to work also with versions of sagelib that are already released.

This should work in the case of sagelib already released and if the optional extension is already installed, it will be overriden I think.

Thanks for testing!
