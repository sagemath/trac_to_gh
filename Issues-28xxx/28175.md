`sage.numerical.backends` depends on very little from Sage. We propose to split out the optional backends (COIN, CPLEX, Gurobi) to separate Cython packages. 

With this ticket, sagelib no longer has the optional dependency on cbc. Instead, these new packages depend on the `sage` package (i.e., sagelib).

This makes it easier to reconfigure when new solvers are installed, as sagelib does not have to be recompiled. By eliminating the use of the optional extensions mechanisms from sagelib, this will also simplify packaging binary distributions.

The new packages are on PyPI:

```
wget -P upstream https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/29/8a/65fd90a890fcfb56166c4071aa7a4fb5b865d313304f60474870f0e89998/sage_numerical_backends_cplex-9.0b12.tar.gz

Can you be more precise on your plans.

These backends are used in graphs. So what will happen if linear programming backends are in a separate package ?

In my plan, the backends would be a standard package of the sage distribution, and the cython modules it provides would be automatically imported when MixedIntegerLinearProgram is used.

It just installs itself as a Python package named `sage_numerical_backends_coin.coin_backend` (note, underscores, not dots).

for coin, there is a verssion mismatch. On pypi and in the ticket description the minor version is b9, in build/pkgs/ it is b10, the latest on github is b12 :-)

So I took b12 from github, renamed the tarfile (arrgh), bumped up the version,

Perhaps Gurobi (and similarly, CPLEX) can get some spkg-configure.m4 helpers to reduce the hassle of

```
export GUROBI_HOME="/opt/gurobi900/linux64"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"
```
to a minimum.
E.g. there could be an `--with-gurobi-home=` option which would default to
`$GUROBI_HOME`, 
and `GUROBI_HOME` should be written in `sage-env-config` etc.

This is for a follow-up ticket, of course.

The macOS installer of Gurobi adds the following symlinks:

```
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  40 Apr 28  2016 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.env -> //Library/gurobi651/mac64/bin/gurobi.env
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi.sh -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi.sh
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  39 Dec 24 12:11 /usr/local/bin/gurobi_cl -> //Library/gurobi900/mac64/bin/gurobi_cl
```

See https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/blob/master/README.md (just updated) - 
I am using gurobi.sh to do all the build configuration. 
Does this work on Linux?

I see, on Linux it's not an installer but just a tgz.

Thanks a lot! I was briefly looking into this before I created the new packages, but was discouraged by various warnings on this page that seemed to imply one needs control of all packages sharing a namespace simultaneously. But I want the packages to work also with versions of sagelib that are already released.
Which of the three approaches mentioned on the page do you specifically recommend?

This should work in the case of sagelib already released and if the optional extension is already installed, it will be overriden I think.
