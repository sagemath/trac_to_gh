Right now, the class `Polynomial_template` contains a method `_derivative`, called from the generic `derivative` (from `Polynomial`) through the function `multi_derivative` of `misc/derivative.pyx`. This method is quite badly written, with at least the following consequences:

- It is **really** slow:

```python
sage: R.<x> = GF(65537)[]
sage: p = R.random_element(10^4)
sage: %time _ = p.derivative()
CPU times: user 6.91 s, sys: 3.7 ms, total: 6.91 s
Wall time: 6.91 s
```

- It breaks the differentiation of rational functions, cf #26844:

```python
sage: A = PolynomialRing(GF(3), name='t')
sage: K = A.fraction_field()
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: t.derivative(t)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to t
```


After removal:

```python
sage: R.<x> = GF(65537)[]
sage: p = R.random_element(10^4)
sage: %time _ = p.derivative()
CPU times: user 48.5 ms, sys: 145 µs, total: 48.7 ms
Wall time: 48.3 ms
```


```python
sage: A = PolynomialRing(GF(3), name='t')
sage: K = A.fraction_field()
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: t.derivative(t)
1
```

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Marc, 

I imported the removed doctests, and had errors... I had to change the error message when one tries to differentiate with respect to something "weird". In my view, this improves the current situation. In particular I do not find the following doctest (that I changed) very satisfying:

```
In the following example, it doesn't recognise 2\*x as the
generator, so it tries to differentiate each of the coefficients
with respect to 2\*x, which doesn't work because the integer
coefficients don't have a _derivative() method::

    sage: f._derivative(2*x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '_derivative'
```

The new doctest seems more reasonable to me:

```
It is not possible to differentiate with respect to 2\*x for instance::

    sage: f._derivative(2*x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to 2*x
```
