All spherical Bessel functions have the wrong sign for negative argument. This can be fixed by taking the square root of the argument before combining it with the other parts of the functional definition, instead of taking a square root of the inverse of the argument as is currently being done.

The mathematical definition has not been altered. The issue is the numerical evaluation of the square root to give the proper sign for negative arguments. The proposed fix takes care of that without needing to consider any special cases.

Then there is something I don't understand. With the DLMF definition I linked to (and assuming the standard branch of the square root), one has:

```
sage: n = 3
sage: z = -4
sage: CBF(1/2*pi/z).sqrt()*CBF(z).bessel_J(n+1/2)
[0.229243857955030 +/- 5.17e-16]
```
Your patch changes that result to its opposite.

If you repeat the evaluation with `z=4` you'll get exactly the same result, which contradicts the identity you mentioned [above](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28474?#comment:4). You can verify the identity by looking at these functions [expressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Bessel_functions:_jn,_yn) in terms of circular functions: they need to be odd in the argument for odd `n`.

In my own JavaScript [library](https://github.com/paulmasson/math) I had assumed that the straightforward calculation would give the standard branch but it doesn't. I only noticed the issue here while fixing the same [issue](https://github.com/paulmasson/math/issues/5) in my library.
