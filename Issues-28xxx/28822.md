When creating an order, the function field code searches for an element in the order (an integral element) that also generates the function field.  It does so by looping over the order's basis elements to find one whose minimal polynomial has the same degree as the field extension.  If none of the basis elements meet this condition, the code currently detects this with an `if` statement, but will probably throw an exception when it tries to access an attribute (`_kummer_places`) that never got assigned because it was in the `if` block.

The condition is always met for all of our test cases, and I suspect that it will always be met, though I don't have a proof for this right now.  If it is possible that the condition might not be met, then the current code would trigger an eventual exception.

This ticket replaces the `if` block with an `assert`, which I think is more in the spirit of what this code is doing.
