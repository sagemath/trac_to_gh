```
This ticket defines a method `is_consequence` for the class `BooleanFormula`. This method provides the same functionality as the function `valid_consequence` (which is now deprecated): the method returns `True` if `self` is a tautological consequence of the given formula(s).

```

sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: f.is_consequence(g)
False
sage: g.is_consequence(f)
True
```
In addition, the function call `is_consequence(conclusion,hypotheses)` is defined to be a synonym for `conclusion.is_consequence(hypotheses)` and is therefore a drop-in replacement for the deprecated function `valid_consequence`.

I recommend closing this ticket as "invalid/wontfix", because the functionality is already available by using `sage.logic.propcalc.valid_consequence`.

```
sage: from sage.logic.propcalc import valid_consequence
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: valid_consequence(g,f) # is g a tautological consequence of f ?
True
sage: valid_consequence(f,g) # is f a tautological consequence of g ?
False

Thanks for telling me about `foo = foo`. I was going to do something more complicated.
1. I defined a method of the class `BooleanFormula` by moving the code for `valid_consequence` from `propcalc.py` into `boolformula.py`.
2. I named the method `is_consequence` (and also defined a standalone function of this same name), to be consistent with the methods `is_satisfiable`, `is_contradiction`, etc., but retained `valid_consequence` as a deprecated function for backwards compatibility (in the file `propcalc.py`).
3. I refactored the code for the `is_consequence` method, added coverage of the case where there are no hypotheses, and added more doctests.
4. I made some other minor tweaks to `propcalc.py` and `boolformula.py`, such as changing "http" to "https".
5. I revised the description of this ticket. 
Should some of this be on a separate ticket?
