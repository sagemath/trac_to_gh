```
At this stage we have the following problem with the notation of inverses:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: aib = M.automorphism_field([[0, 2], [-1, 0]], name='a^(-1)*b')
sage: c = aib.inverse(); c
Field of tangent-space automorphisms a^(-1)*b^(-1) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

That is definitely misleading. In this ticket it gets fixed by adding brackets around the element before taking its inverse if the name could cause any confusion:

```
sage: c = aib.inverse(); c
Field of tangent-space automorphisms (a^(-1)*b)^(-1) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

To solve this, the ticket provides a modification of `is_atomic` in `sage/tensor/modules/format_utilities.py`.

As you can see from the latest patchbot report, `<>` still causes some trouble:

```
-Python3 incompatible code inserted on 0 non-empty lines
+inside file:  b/src/sage/tensor/modules/format_utilities.py

```
Apparently, the operator `<>` has been removed in Python 3: it does not appear in the list
https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html.
So please remove this doctest.
