The precision markers check the precision of real and imaginary part individually. That is problematic when one of the parts is so small that it may be 0, because even 1e-16 is not equal to no number at all.

I ran into this problem when running the sage testsuite on aarch64. There, the 3.88...e-16 components in the touched test files just reduces to 0 because of architecture-dependent precision differences.

Using dots is not particularly nice. Ideally we'd want `#abs tol` to relate to the norm of complex numbers. This works in the meanwhile though.

Maybe. But we are talking about polynomial roots, and, on top of that, very simple ones. To me it would be the sign of a serious problem if they were not accurate essentially to the last digit.

Yes, that's what I meant by “essentially”. An error that affects half of the mantissa is a different story (for instance, it could come from doing one less Newton step than you should, or using a formula subject to catastrophic cancellation, or inadvertently casting from `float` to `double`).
