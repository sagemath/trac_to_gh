in `traversals.pyx`

```diff
-    :meth:`~lex_Up` | Perform a lexicographic up (LexUp) on the graph.
+    :meth:`~lex_UP` | Perform a lexicographic UP search (LexUP) on the graph.
```

- you have not added an alias for `lex_DOWN` in `generic_graph.py`

- unify the one line description for `Lex_DOWN` everywhere. The work `search` is missing, etc.

- you can add a SEEALSO block with links to `Lex_BFS`, `Lex_DFS`, etc.
