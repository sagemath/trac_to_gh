Using `sdh_cmake` is a good idea.

I am not sure whether the variable `PYTHON` is the standard option for the path to the Python executable in general.

Here is what `sdh_cmake` does

```
    echo "Configuring $PKG_NAME with cmake"
    cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="${SAGE_LOCAL}" \
            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib \
            "$@"
```
awali seems to use some non-standard version of this, namely `INSTALL_PREFIX`. So the `sdh_cmake` script is useless in this situation.
