```
Following a suggestion by vbraun in #19680, this ticket adds a 
`_spkg_check` package (`type`=`script`) that 
- installs the Python packages`tox`, `mock`, `pytest` via `pip` if `SAGE_CHECK=true` 
- does nothing otherwise.

The package `_spkg_check` can be added as a dependency of Python packages that use this standard testing infrastructure, for testing them if `SAGE_CHECK=true`.

The branch demonstrates this on the package `pygments` by adding an `spkg-check`.


If this approach is favored, probably the spkg `nose`, currently a dependency of `cvxopt` and `networkx`, could be removed.
