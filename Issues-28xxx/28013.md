Currently, this is a hack to see whether building on Docker works. We should of course build both Py2 and Py3.

Currently it looks like my gitlab runners *are* working, but every ticket build is timing out because for some reason they're all trying to build openblas, and then timing out after 3 hours.

The openblas update is new as of I think 8.8.rc0 (I think it was maybe a mistake to update as big a package as openblas in a *release candidate*).  The docker build of 8.8.rc0 seems to have failed in the test-dev job for some random reason.  So I'll try re-running it...  Then all the 8.8.rc1 builds failed as well for some non-obvious reason.

Oh, I see, building/releasing from the 8.8.rc1 *tag* did pass, but from the *develop* branch did not pass.

I guess then maybe many of the trac tickets are not based off 8.8.rc1 yet so they're still pulling docker images of older builds that don't include the openblas update.
