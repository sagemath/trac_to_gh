In combinatorics, the Eulerian number A(n, m), is the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element (permutations with m "ascents"). They are the coefficients of the Eulerian polynomials -[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_number)

It would be nice to have Eulerian polynomials and numbers available in Sage. 
Two possible ways to do this are::

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def eulerian_polynomial(n):
....:     R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't')
....:     if n == 0:
....:         return R.one()
....:     t = R.gen()
....:     return R.sum(binomial(n,k) * eulerian_polynomial(k) * (t-1)**(n-1-k) for k in range(n))
```
or using another recurrence relation

```
sage: def eulerian_numbers(n):
....:     A = zero_matrix(n+1,n+1)
....:     A[0,0] = 1
....:     for i in range(1,n+1):
....:         A[i,0] = 0
....:         A[i,1] = 1
....:     for j in range(2,n+1):                                                      
....:         for k in range(2,j+1):                                                  
....:             if j == k:                                                          
....:                 A[j,k] = 1                                                      
....:             else:                                                               
....:                 A[j,k] = (j-k+1)*A[j-1,k-1] +k*A[j-1,k]
....:     return(A)
....: 
....: def eulerian_polynomial(n):
....:     R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't')
....:     t = R.gen()
....:     A = eulerian_numbers(n)
....:     return(R.sum( A[n,i]*t**i for i in range(n+1)))
```

I'm not sure what the best output of the eulerian_numbers function is.

Looking into the source, I believe a good place to go would be in `sage.combinat.combinat`. That's where Stirling numbers and other similar sequences of numbers are.

It would be nice to have access to both the numbers and the polynomials:

- `eulerian_polynomial(n)` would return the `n`-th Eulerian polynomial (recursively defined)
- `eulerian_number(i,n)` would return the `i`-th coefficient of the `n`-th Eulerian polynomial. (or `(n,i)` whatever fits the actual conventions best).

I guess both would benefit from recursive functions. I would look at Stirling numbers for inspiration.

I would say that `eulerian_number` should just return an integer. It is then easy to create array if one want...

```
sage: [eulerian_number(i,5) for i in range(6)]
```

for example.

+1 for also adding the Narayama numbers.

Have you run some tests of the different implementations to see which one is faster? I am a little worried about that derivative and the products being slow compared to one multiplication in the proposed first implementation above (after expanding `(t-1)**(n-1-k)` within the code). Granted, this will likely not need to be such a speed critical implementation, so we shouldn't spend too much time on this. However, I think we should at least take a moment to look at it.

I have added a recursive computation for single coefficients. Maybe one could also have the direct formula for the coefficients.

The other recurrence for the polynomials seems to be wrong, unless I missed something.

**EDIT**: maybe speed is not the first concern here..

It seems to agree with the Wikipedia page, so if it is wrong, then Wikipedia is also wrong here. (Which is always possible.) Unfortunately it sounds like we need to check to see which parts of the page are correct. `:/` I can do this tomorrow.

Agreed, but I was hoping it would be a simple thing to check/implement (at most an hour). I can do this in more detail tomorrow once I get back. (I am finishing up a conference this week.)

Thank you.

I think it would be better for the cache key not to depend on the algorithm, so

```python
@cached_function(key=lambda n,k,a: (n,k))
def eulerian_number(n, k, algorithm='recursive'):
```
and similarly for the polynomial (although this will mean you need a new test case for the `"coeffs"` algorithm). Also, I think the `"coeffs"` should not use the recursive algorithm for the Eulerian numbers.
