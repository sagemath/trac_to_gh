In combinatorics, the Eulerian number A(n, m), is the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element (permutations with m "ascents"). They are the coefficients of the Eulerian polynomials -[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_number)

It would be nice to have Eulerian polynomials and numbers available in Sage. 
Two possible ways to do this are::

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def eulerian_polynomial(n):
....:     R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't')
....:     if n == 0:
....:         return R.one()
....:     t = R.gen()
....:     return R.sum(binomial(n,k) * eulerian_polynomial(k) * (t-1)**(n-1-k) for k in range(n))
```
or using another recurrence relation

```
sage: def eulerian_numbers(n):
....:     A = zero_matrix(n+1,n+1)
....:     A[0,0] = 1
....:     for i in range(1,n+1):
....:         A[i,0] = 0
....:         A[i,1] = 1
....:     for j in range(2,n+1):                                                      
....:         for k in range(2,j+1):                                                  
....:             if j == k:                                                          
....:                 A[j,k] = 1                                                      
....:             else:                                                               
....:                 A[j,k] = (j-k+1)*A[j-1,k-1] +k*A[j-1,k]
....:     return(A)
....: 
....: def eulerian_polynomial(n):
....:     R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't')
....:     t = R.gen()
....:     A = eulerian_numbers(n)
....:     return(R.sum( A[n,i]*t**i for i in range(n+1)))
```

I'm not sure what the best output of the eulerian_numbers function is.

Looking into the source, I believe a good place to go would be in `sage.combinat.combinat`. That's where Stirling numbers and other similar sequences of numbers are.

It would be nice to have access to both the numbers and the polynomials:

- `eulerian_polynomial(n)` would return the `n`-th Eulerian polynomial (recursively defined)
- `eulerian_number(i,n)` would return the `i`-th coefficient of the `n`-th Eulerian polynomial. (or `(n,i)` whatever fits the actual conventions best).

I guess both would benefit from recursive functions. I would look at Stirling numbers for inspiration.

I would say that `eulerian_number` should just return an integer. It is then easy to create array if one want...

```
sage: [eulerian_number(i,5) for i in range(6)]
```

for example.

I have added a recursive computation for single coefficients. Maybe one could also have the direct formula for the coefficients.

The other recurrence for the polynomials seems to be wrong, unless I missed something.

**EDIT**: maybe speed is not the first concern here..

This is on the wikipedia page as an alternating sum of binomials.

Thank you.

I think it would be better for the cache key not to depend on the algorithm, so

```python
@cached_function(key=lambda n,k,a: (n,k))
def eulerian_number(n, k, algorithm='recursive'):
```
and similarly for the polynomial (although this will mean you need a new test case for the `"coeffs"` algorithm). Also, I think the `"coeffs"` should not use the recursive algorithm for the Eulerian numbers.
