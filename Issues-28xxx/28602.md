The objective of this ticket is to allow the user to specify the order of the hyperplanes when constructing a hyperplane arrangement. There are various reasons why a user might want to use a custom ordering, for example, to specify the order of the components in the sign vector, to specify the labelling of the elements of the associated matroid, etc.

Currently, the order of the hyperplanes is ignored as Sage just sorts the list of hyperplanes:

```
sage: H.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: H(x, y, x-1, y-1)
Arrangement <y - 1 | y | x - 1 | x>
```

For backwards compatibility, we could implement a keyword argument, say `sort=False` that defaults to `sort=True` to preserve the current behaviour:

```
sage: H.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)

sage: H(x, y, x-1, y-1, sort=True) # default
Arrangement <y - 1 | y | x - 1 | x>

sage: H(x, y, x-1, y-1, sort=False) # desired behaviour
Arrangement <x | y | x - 1 | y - 1>
```
