```

The description in #22380 indicates that it was included at one point as *part* of cvxopt, but I never had any problems related to this before.  

Depends on #28832

I also wonder how many times one can safely repeat `-L/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/lib` in parameters...

This is the most minimal patch I could come up with for now.  It required changes in quite a few files for them to install files properly on Cygwin.  I didn't touch the libraries that use CMake (and they might already work better), or any other make targets that don't need to work for Sage's purposes.

A better solution would involve a total reworking of the build system.

Rather than patching, I did consider just updating our `spkg-install` with some Cygwin-specific commands to move things around after the initial faulty installation.  That conceivably could have worked, but might be an even bigger and uglier mess.  I'll propose my changes, or something like it, to upstream later.

Still need to test that the rest of the Sage build passes.

I think you meant "local/lib rather than in local/bin"? :)  And yes, that was part of the problem.  It actually didn't even properly detect building on Cygwin, and the implementation of doing so (which in fairness was noted in the comments as "untested") was indeed completely broken.  It also didn't properly produce import libs for the DLLs, and a number of other odd issues.

Beyond just the Cygwin issues though the whole thing is a bit of a mess :D

We shouldn't need `SuiteSparse_GPURuntime` or `xerbla`. One needs a config flag to be run and the other need to be explicitly build as far as I can see. The rest looks OK to me. 

Of course extra useless (for sage) patching doesn't hurt. Keeping as close as you would like upstream to take it is definitely OK.

Let's see how it goes.
