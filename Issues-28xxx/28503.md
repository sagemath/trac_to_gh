```
sage: f = QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: f = f.extend_domain(ZZ).extend_codomain(QQ)
sage: f
Composite map:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Rational Field
  Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Integer Ring
        then
          Natural morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Rational Field
        then
          Identity endomorphism of Rational Field
sage: f.then()
Traceback (most recent call):
...
TypeError: __init__() takes at least 2 positional arguments (1 given)
```

By the way, shouldn't `extend_domain` and `extend_codomain` check if the requested extension is trivial and just return `self` in this case?
