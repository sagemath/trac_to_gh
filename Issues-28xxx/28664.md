On Debian 8, after downloading Sage 8.8 as follows:

```
$ curl -O https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/linux/64bit/sage-8.8-Debian_GNU_Linux_8-x86_64.tar.bz2
$ tar xf sage-8.8-Debian_GNU_Linux_8-x86_64.tar.bz2
```
and launching Sage as follows:

```
$ ./SageMath/sage
```
running the following commands:

```
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
```
gives an incorrect result:

```
'/.../local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nullpoints/default.json'
```

The output should be a filename but it's not.
A build from source doesn't have that problem.

Seems a precompiled Sage binary also cannot load strategy files stored elsewhere, so something is really broken there:

```python
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 8.9, Release Date: 2019-09-29                     │
│ Using Python 2.7.15. Type "help()" for help.                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY_PATH
'/bulk/home/malb/software/SageMath/local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nulls'
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
'/bulk/home/malb/software/SageMath/local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nulls/default.json'
sage: print load_strategies_json("/home/malb/projects/lattices/fplll/strategies/default.json")[60]
Strategy< 60, (), 1.00-1.00>
```

The above should print `Strategy< 60, (40), 0.29-0.50>`

See https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/159

Any ideas?

This looks like a bug in binary-pkg which looks for `\0` character at the end of the path, but the path being stored in a C++ string, the NULL character does not exist at the end.

Adding -std=c++11 to CXXFLAGS forces the C++ compiler to enforce C++11 which enforces that std::string terminate with `\0` in the internal buffer.

From my limited testing, this fixes the issue.

Oh, thanks!

I'm not clear though on where `-std=c++11` is missing, FPLLL is currently being compiled with:

```
AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX([11],[noext],[mandatory])
```

which should set `-std=c++11`. But from my local testing it doesn't seem to (?)

- #28886, merged in Sage 9.1.beta1, upgraded to FPLLL 5.3.2 and FPyLLL 0.5.1.dev.
- #30021, merged in Sage 9.2.beta4, upgraded to FPLLL 5.3.3.

On Debian 10 buster, after downloading Sage 9.1 as follows:

```
$ SAGE_VERSION=9.1
$ DEBIAN_VERSION=`source /etc/os-release ; echo $VERSION_ID`
$ MIRROR=https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/linux/64bit
$ TARBALL=sage-$SAGE_VERSION-Debian_GNU_Linux_$DEBIAN_VERSION-x86_64.tar.bz2
$ curl -O $MIRROR/$TARBALL
$ tar xf $TARBALL
```
and launching Sage as follows:

```
$ ./SageMath/sage -q
```
running the following two commands:

```
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
```
still gives the same incorrect result:

```
'/.../local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nullpointer.'
```

while with Sage built from source on the same machine:

```
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
b'/.../local/share/fplll/strategies/default.json'
```

So even after #28886 Sage built from source gets this right
while Sage binaries don't.
