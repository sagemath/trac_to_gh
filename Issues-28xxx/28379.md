2 of the new doctests are failing.

They are still python integers for some reason?

A question:

Removing the following line is ok?

```diff
- PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
```

Wasn't it the way to should be? Or it would be caught earlier in the call/the creation of the object?

It is the way it should be done, but it is not the place it should be done. The function `_nmz_result` has as first argument `normaliz_cone`... which means that it is never called if `PyNormaliz` is not present. Checking for its presence inside the function is very weird.

ok! good to know.

> The function `_nmz_result` has as first argument `normaliz_cone`... which means that it is never called if `PyNormaliz` is not present. Checking for its presence inside the function is very weird.


Yep, I see. I probably forgot that instance when I changed the import...

In the bot, there is one doctest warning in `platonic.py` that gives one doctest failure.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/plot/plot3d/platonic.py

It does not seem to have anything to do with this ticket though... Hmm.
