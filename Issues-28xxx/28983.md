We are interested in computing the (iterated) residue of a function. First, we can use the fact that the pole is always simple to multiply and take the limit.

```
br(x) = 1-x
q1,q2,q3,m = var('q1,q2,q3,m')
assume(q1>0,q2>0,q3>0,m>0)
q4 = (q1*q2*q3)^-1
k = 2
rho = [1,q4]
X = [var("x%d" % i) for i in range(k)]
chi1 = prod([ br(X[j]/m)/(br(X[j])*X[j]) for j in range(k)])
chi2 = prod([ prod([ br(q1*q2*X[i]/X[j])*br(q1*q3*X[i]/X[j])*br(q2*q3*X[i]/X[j]) for i in range(k) if i != j]) for j in range(k)])
chi3 = prod([ prod([ br(q1*X[i]/X[j])*br(q2*X[i]/X[j])*br(q3*X[i]/X[j])*br(q4*X[i]/X[j]) for i in range(k) if i != j]) for j in range (k)])
chi = (chi1*chi2/chi3).factor()
for xi,rhoi in zip(X,rho):
#    chi = chi.residue(xi==rhoi).combine().factor()
    chi = (chi*(xi-rhoi)).factor().subs({xi: rhoi})
chi.factor()
```
This gives the correct result.
If we instead employ the residue method

```
br(x) = 1-x
q1,q2,q3,m = var('q1,q2,q3,m')
assume(q1>0,q2>0,q3>0,m>0)
q4 = (q1*q2*q3)^-1
k = 2
rho = [1,q4]
X = [var("x%d" % i) for i in range(k)]
chi1 = prod([ br(X[j]/m)/(br(X[j])*X[j]) for j in range(k)])
chi2 = prod([ prod([ br(q1*q2*X[i]/X[j])*br(q1*q3*X[i]/X[j])*br(q2*q3*X[i]/X[j]) for i in range(k) if i != j]) for j in range(k)])
chi3 = prod([ prod([ br(q1*X[i]/X[j])*br(q2*X[i]/X[j])*br(q3*X[i]/X[j])*br(q4*X[i]/X[j]) for i in range(k) if i != j]) for j in range (k)])
chi = (chi1*chi2/chi3).factor()
for xi,rhoi in zip(X,rho):
    chi = chi.residue(xi==rhoi).combine().factor()
#    chi = (chi*(xi-rhoi)).factor().subs({xi: rhoi})
chi
```
it is wrong. I believe this is a bug in residue that comes from series.

As a side note, if we replace

```
br(x) = 1-x
```
with

```
br(x) = sqrt(x)-1/sqrt(x)
```
then the first method is still the only correct one, but it does not factorize all square roots to the simplest form.

This can be closed as a **duplicate** of #31479 (and #31679), which was fixed in 9.3.rc5.

To verify this, note that the bug on this ticket has gone away (i.e., both code snippets in the ticket description give the same result), and remains fixed even if you remove all of the files except `disable_poly_mul_expand.patch` from the `build/pkgs/pynac/patches/` directory (and do `./sage -f pynac`). However, the bug comes back if you remove this final pynac patch (and do `./sage -f pynac`).
