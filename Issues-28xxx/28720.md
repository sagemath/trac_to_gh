This

```
m = matrix(QQ, 3, [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, -2, 1, 2])
m.is_diagonalizable()
```
raises an error rather than giving False. The error message gives an explanation why the matrix is not diagonalizable. But an `is_*()` method should give either True or False, for legitimate inputs.

As discussed in 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/OiS-_irTtWA

we fix this bug. Along the way, a companion method `diagonalization()` is newly added. This method is much faster than `jordan_form(transformation=True)` for diagonalizable matrices.
