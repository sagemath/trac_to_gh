We propose to restart the effort to have a Macaulay 2 package (http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/)
(cf e.g. #11710 for previous tries).

[According to Mike Stillman], there are some technical challenges: Released versions of M2 patch libraries such as FLINT to address garbage collector issues. 
There is an effort underway to use unpatched versions of libraries: https://github.com/antonleykin/M2/tree/eigen . A Macaulay 2 package for Sage could be based on this branch, or on a possible future release based on this branch.
