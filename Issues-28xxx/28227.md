Fix the Python 3 doctest failures in `combinat/root_systems/weyl_characters.py`. The failures all come down to sorting. The more complicated problem is the method `fusion_labels` which relies on sorted output when it shouldn't.

It would be clearer if the second test here makes use of the sorted basis instead of sorting the highest weights, assuming assigning labels in the third test takes those weights into account.

```
        sage: sorted(B22.basis(), key=str)
        [B22(0,0), B22(0,1), B22(0,2), B22(1,0), B22(1,1), B22(2,0)]
        sage: sorted([x.highest_weight() for x in B22.basis()], key=str)
        [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1/2, 1/2), (2, 0), (3/2, 1/2)]
        sage: B22.fusion_labels(['1','X','Y1','Y2','Xp','Z'])
```

Also, I am wondering whether the more fundamental problem is that `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` used for the basis does not give consistent results.

```
sage: S = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([1000], lambda a: [a//2, a//3]); S
A recursively enumerated set (breadth first search)
sage: str(list(S))  # py3
'[1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, 111, 37, 83, 125, 55, 41, 12, 18, 27, 62, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20, 31, 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 0, 5, 7]'
sage: str(list(S))  # py2
'[1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, 111, 37, 83, 125, 55, 41, 18, 27, 12, 62, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20, 31, 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 0, 5, 7]'
```
If the successor function gives consistent results, the breadth-first search should be unique, should it not?

I can only reproduce this if I check out the branch and fail to run `make` or `./sage -b` before running tests. Can you double check that you really get this failure?

Should we delay the changes here until #27967 is resolved, or do these and then perhaps have to change then again depending on #27967 and/or other changes to `RecursiveEnumeratedSet`?

I had a mess in my py2 local branch. It works now.

IMO, it would be better to delay this as it is a change of the API, not just the doctests. I am not sure where #27967 is headed though, so I will not insist. Feel free to set this to positive if you prefer these changes be merged now.

If you think that #27967 will take a while to get resolved, then maybe we should merge these changes now to fix these doctests, but the two of you (vklein, gh-mwageringel) have a better idea of the fate of #27967 than I do, so I will let you decide what to do here.

I think we should merge this ticket now.

>Also, why should the enumeration order be certified? This is not claimed in the documentation.

I think this is a valid point and therefore modifying RecursivelyEnumeratedSet rather than the classes using it is debatable. So yes i think #27967 will take a while.
