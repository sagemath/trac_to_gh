On OS X, `./sage -f -c openblas` can fail (but it's intermittent) with the message

```
ld: file too small (length=0) file '../libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.6.a' for architecture x86_64
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[3]: *** [dblat1] Error 1
```
If I look at `local/var/tmp/sage/build/openblas-0.3.6.p0/src`, I see

```
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 jpalmier staff       29 Nov 13 13:04 libopenblas.a -> libopenblas_haswellp-r0.3.6.a

I don't know why it's looking for `libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.6.a`.
