On OS X, `./sage -f -c openblas` can fail (but it's intermittent) with the message

```
ld: file too small (length=0) file '../libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.6.a' for architecture x86_64

make[3]: *** [dblat1] Error 1
```
If I look at `local/var/tmp/sage/build/openblas-0.3.6.p0/src`, I see

I don't know why it's looking for `libopenblas_skylakexp-r0.3.6.a`.
