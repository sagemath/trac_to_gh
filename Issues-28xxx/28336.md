Keywords: sagedays103, dynamics, curves

Sage outputs -1 as the genus of a curve, it should probably throw an error instead. The genus function doesn't seem to check if the function is irreducible, and it just attempts to calculate the genus anyway. 

```
sage: FF.<c>  =QQ[] 
sage: R.<x> = FF[]
sage: K = QQ[c, x]
sage: poly2 = K(x^2 - c^4)
sage: C2 = Curve(poly2)
sage: C2.genus()
-1
```
