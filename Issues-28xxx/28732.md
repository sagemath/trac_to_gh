Works and passes with `SAGE_CHECK` on OS X + Python 2 as well!  I'd say if someone checks on Linux that would be enough, though hopefully none of the changes would really impact that.

As a side thing, I'll note we receive the following message:

```
[sagetex-3.4] LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
[sagetex-3.4]

```
which indicates to me that maybe the check script should run `pdflatex` *twice* after running Sage, just to resolve those annoying warnings as per usual when TeXing.  I don't know about the `\end` thing because I don't recall seeing that when building `example.tex` on its own to test.

I see the `\end` statement with the current version of SageTeX, too, so this is not a regression. It's actually coming from the file `sagetex.dtx`, not `example.tex`.

I agree that to produce a good PDF file, you should run pdflatex twice after running sagetex, but we don't actually care about that for testing: we just want to make sure that sagetex seems to be functioning. This would work, but I don't think it's necessary:
