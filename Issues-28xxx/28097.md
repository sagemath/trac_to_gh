Let

```
A = J0(23)
C = A.cuspidal_subgroup()
```

I want to compute the quotient of `A` by `C`. Running `A / C` or `A.quotient(C)` returns `(B, phi)`, where `B` is the quotient and `phi` is a map to the quotient. This ticket adds a `map_to_quotient` flag and make these equivalent

```
B = A.quotient(C)[0]
B, _ = A.quotient(C)
B = A.quotient(C, map_to_quotient=False)
```

I like the last one the most which is the reason for this ticket.

Keywords: **modabvar, quotient**
