The coefficients of an affine connection D in a frame (e<sub>i</sub>) are computed according to the formula

Gamma<sup>k</sup><sub>ij</sub> = (De<sub>i</sub>)(f<sub>k</sub> , e<sub>j</sub>)

where (f<sub>k</sub>) stands for the coframe dual to (e<sub>i</sub>). In the current implementation, this is performed by a triple loop on k, i and j with a recomputation of De<sub>i</sub> at each stage of the inner loop (!). This makes the whole computation terribly slow for manifold dimensions > 2. This ticket reorders the loops, factoring De<sub>i</sub>. As a result, in Sage 8.9.rc1, we move from 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.py
    [441 tests, 132.77 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 132.9 seconds
    cpu time: 152.0 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 132.8 seconds
```
to 

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.py
    [441 tests, 111.16 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 111.3 seconds
    cpu time: 124.1 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 111.2 seconds
```
In passing, additional factorizations have been performed in other loops (in methods `connection_forms`, `curvature_forms`, etc.), but they were less critical since they involve cached quantities.
