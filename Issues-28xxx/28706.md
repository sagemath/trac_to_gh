At [this Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58705064/use-sage-to-compute-ring-quotient), a question arises which boils down (I think) to this interesting comparison.

```
    sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
    sage: Za = ZZ[a]
    sage: OK = K.maximal_order()
    sage: OK.number_field()
    Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
    sage: Za.number_field()
    Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^3 - 2 with a0 = a
    sage: OK.number_field() == Za.number_field()
    False
```
So we don't seem to have a way to compare what appear to be isomorphic number fields that are *output with only a trivial-looking difference to the user*.

I won't suggest a fix that would make this work - perhaps it is technically impossible.  But at least the documentation at [generating orders](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/number_fields/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.html#sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_absolute.order) that advertises the syntax `ZZ[a]` should be strongly updated to make it clear how misleading this will be.
