In Polyhedron the used abbreviation for representation is rep as in `Hrep_generator` etc.

Accordingly, this abbreviation is adopted for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

While we are at it we fix some instances of the typo `representaion`.

We add a deprecation warning for the keyword `Vrepr` of `CombinatorialPolyhedron.__init__`.

We remove a redefinition of a deprecated method (`n_Hrepr` of combinatorial face).
