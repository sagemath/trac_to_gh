Is there a reason why you didn't also change this to a `dict` comprehension?

```diff
-        elems = dict((v, self._left_action_mats[edge][v]*element._elems[v]) for v in self._quiver)
+        elems = dict((v, self._left_action_mats[edge][v]*element._elems[v])
+                     for v in self._quiver)
```
In this change:

```diff
-        result = parent()   # this must not be the cached parent.zero(),
-                             # since otherwise it gets changed in place!!
+        result = parent()
+        # this must not be the cached parent.zero(),
+        # since otherwise it gets changed in place!!
```
I think it would be better for the comment to go first. Also, in principle, the result of `parent()` could use the cached `zero` method since we assume elements are immutable. So I think it would be better (and faster) to explicitly construct the zero element.

I have made the trivial changes that you suggested.

Concerning the zero, it seems that there is really a problem. This looks serious enough that it should be kept for a dedicated ticket. Moreover, I am not sure that the coercion framework is used correctly, as this happens inside a double underscore method `__mul__`.
