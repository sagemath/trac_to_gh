At this stage, the pushforward of a vector field `v` along a differentiable map `Phi` reads `Phi^*v`. This contradicts the common literature where the pushforward usually writes `Phi_*v`.

In this ticket, a discussion is wanted and eventually a correction is performed.

It seems to me that in some texts, `Phi^*` and `Phi_*` are used to denote respectively the pushforward and the pullback. I'll look for some precise references.

Yeah, it's always about conventions and historical remains...

Basically, this is not completely trustworthy, but [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/68788/idea-of-the-star-position-in-pullback-pushforward-notation) is an approach of explaination on stackexchange.
