At this stage, the pushforward of a vector field `v` along a differentiable map `Phi` reads `Phi^*v`. This contradicts the common literature where the pushforward usually writes `Phi_*v`.

In this ticket, a discussion is wanted and eventually a correction is performed.

Yeah, it's always about conventions and historical remains...

Basically, this is not completely trustworthy, but [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/68788/idea-of-the-star-position-in-pullback-pushforward-notation) is an approach of explaination on stackexchange.
