The following code doesn't work on my computer (Ubuntu 18.04.3, Intel Core i7-8550U, 64 bits, with sage-8.9.beta9 installed from source). If we change the 45 to 40, then it works (it fails when I draw too much Polyedrons).

```
P = Polyhedron([(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(0,0,0)])
g = Graphics()
for i in range(45):
    g += P.plot()
g
```

It raise the following error:

```

    645         # Check the CRC if we're at the end of the file
    646         if eof and self._running_crc != self._expected_crc:

    648 
    649     def read1(self, n):

```

45 Polyedrons is not a lot ! Sage should be able to plot thousand of them.

I'm working in Jupyter. When I try in the old sage notebook, then it works.
And when I try from the console, then it does'nt work at all : Jmol starts, but is stuck (I waited for at least 10 min).
