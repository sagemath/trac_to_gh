<div id="comment:0"></div>

The following dependencies were incorrect:
- `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense` does not use `png.h`
- `sage.modules.vector_mod2_dense` does not use `png.h`
- `sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense` does not use `m4ri.h`

The following dependencies are in Cython files, so Cython picks them up automatically:
- `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense dependency` on `m4ri.h`
- `sage.modules.vector_mod2_dense dependency` on `m4ri.h`
- `sage.matrix.matrix_gf2e_dense dependency` on `m4rie.h`
    
The following include and dependency was removed:
- `pb_wrap.h` included `m4ri/m4ri.h` for no apparent reason, everything still works after removing that include (and therefore also the dependency)

Cython picks up dependencies automatically if they appear in a `cdef extern from "header.h"`

But in this case, the dependency is through `pb_wrap.h`.
