Example from 9.0.beta5:

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: u = x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(u)
sage: C.frobenius_polynomial()
x^8 + 731*x^7 + 6*x^6 - 720*x^5 + 18*x^4 - 2160*x^3 + 54*x^2 + 19737*x + 81
```
This is being computed using Pari, but actually gp gives the correct answer:

```
? u = Mod(1,3)*(x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x)
? hyperellcharpoly(u)
%1 = x^8 + 2*x^7 + 6*x^6 + 9*x^5 + 18*x^4 + 27*x^3 + 54*x^2 + 54*x + 81
```
Since the `x^7` term is off by `3^6`, this is presumably an issue with not enough p-adic precision in the Frobenius matrix we are getting from Pari.

Depends on #28840

It looks like this was a bug which was just fixed upstream: I can reproduce the bug in gp version 2.11.1, but I get the correct answer in 2.11.2 (which is what I originally tried). So a simple Pari update should suffice.

#28424 is somewhat exploratory to check for broken stuff. Of course we have gone on the pari git branch in the past when Jeroen was after new features.

But #28424 shouldn't prevent you from making this ticket an upgrade to 2.11.2 to fix your issue. If that make fell you better most sage-on-distros are probably already using 2.11.2 without reported side effects (apart from getting the right answer in the problem pointed out by this ticket - I know I do in sage-on-gentoo).
