<a id='comment:21'></a>Replying to [comment:8 isuruf]:
> What happens when `gslcblas` and `openblas` are both linked in?

this is what I get with this branch:

```
$ ldd local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cvxopt/gsl.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
...
	libgsl.so.23 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgsl.so.23 (0x00007d76b701a000)
	libopenblas.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenblas.so.0 (0x00007d76b4e36000)
...
	libgslcblas.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgslcblas.so.0 (0x00007d76b48db000)
...
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007d76b462e000)
...
```

so both `libopenblas.so` and `libgslblas.so` are there. 
(I suppose it's the same with Sage-supplied GSL and OpenBLAS)

Are you saying that modifyng `gsl.pc` as suggested here would lead to skipping `libgslblas.so` ?

IMHO this would not lead to re-linking `libgsl.so` with `libopenblas.so`, if it was
already linked with `libgslblas.so`. Woulndn't is need some `LD_PRELOAD` platform-dependent `ld` hacks  --- I guess MacOS would need something quite different to achieve this.

No, see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/f0ae571d17e685258c1de89c2a29953f4d8fb302/build/pkgs/gsl/patches/gsl-2.1-gslcblas.patch . gslcblas is removed sage-suplied GSL.

Yes

`libgsl.so` is not linked to any blas in distros like Ubuntu. It is underlinked. In sage-the-distribution, `libgsl.so` is linked to `libopenblas` and the `-lgslcblas` line is removed from `gsl.pc`.

Yes, it's distro-dependent. So how is this gsl.pc hack supposed to help in such a case (of already linked gslcblas?
Are we left with linking to both openblas and gslcblas then?

well, this does not quite wotk.
After these changes to gsl.pc I see the correct linking command

It is not posix full stop. I am surprised it works as suggested on freeBSD. My experience with AIX `sed`, which is posix, is that `-i` isn't supported at all. Fortunately we don't have to support such dinosaur platforms.

`@`Dima one of the purpose of `-e` is to be able to chain commands.

```
sed -i'' -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
```
is perfectly legal. Of course some line separation gain in clarity, but that's why I would break things into several line in a pure shell script

```
sed  \
       -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  \
       -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' \
       -i'' $SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
```
