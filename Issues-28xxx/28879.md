A bit pathological, but basically nothing visible until you test something with a high precision where there can be divergences between the two. 
If you run GSL test suite with openblas rather than gslcblas you'll get failures of the numerical noise kind.

Honestly, I am not sure which one would be used. My guess would be the first one on the list of libraries linked.

Replying to [isuruf](#comment%3A8):
> What happens when `gslcblas` and `openblas` are both linked in?

this is what I get with this branch:

```
$ ldd local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cvxopt/gsl.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
...
	libgsl.so.23 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgsl.so.23 (0x00007d76b701a000)
	libopenblas.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenblas.so.0 (0x00007d76b4e36000)
...
	libgslcblas.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgslcblas.so.0 (0x00007d76b48db000)
...
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007d76b462e000)
...
```

so both `libopenblas.so` and `libgslblas.so` are there. 
(I suppose it's the same with Sage-supplied GSL and OpenBLAS)

Are you saying that modifyng `gsl.pc` as suggested here would lead to skipping `libgslblas.so` ?

IMHO this would not lead to re-linking `libgsl.so` with `libopenblas.so`, if it was
already linked with `libgslblas.so`. Woulndn't is need some `LD_PRELOAD` platform-dependent `ld` hacks  --- I guess MacOS would need something quite different to achieve this.

`libgsl.so` is not linked to any blas in distros like Ubuntu. It is underlinked. In sage-the-distribution, `libgsl.so` is linked to `libopenblas` and the `-lgslcblas` line is removed from `gsl.pc`.

OK, so `readelf -d` indeed shows that the only linking to gslcblas comes from one of the linked libs

```
0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm.so.6]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgsl.so.23]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libopenblas.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython3.7m.so.1.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpthread.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
```
and it must be libgsl, for obvious reasons.
So that's as good as it gets, we won't try to relink libgsl, right?

It is not posix full stop. I am surprised it works as suggested on freeBSD. My experience with AIX `sed`, which is posix, is that `-i` isn't supported at all. Fortunately we don't have to support such dinosaur platforms.

`@`Dima one of the purpose of `-e` is to be able to chain commands.

```
sed -i'' -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
```
is perfectly legal. Of course some line separation gain in clarity, but that's why I would break things into several line in a pure shell script

```
sed  \
       -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  \
       -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' \
       -i'' $SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
```
