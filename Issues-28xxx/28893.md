The goal of this ticket is to parallelize the f-vector of polyhedra.

This will include having a `nogil` version of the most important methods of `FaceIterator`.

Also we will do some improvements of the current code, mostly for very sparse polyhedra.

This is the current schedule:

-  #28894: Move most important attributes of `FaceIterator` to a structure. 
-  #29676: Make a `nogil` version of the most important methods of `FaceIterator`.
- #31245: Implement parallel f-vector for polytopes
- #31262: Implement non zero chunks for sparse bitsets 

**CC:**  @jplab @LaisRast stumpc5 @slel

**Keywords:** combinatorial polyhedron, f-vector

**Reviewer:** Jonathan Kliem, Samuel Leli√®vre

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28893
