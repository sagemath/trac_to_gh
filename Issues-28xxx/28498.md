As reported in [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47839), there is a memory leak in `BasisExchangeMatroid.components`, see:

```
sage: G = [g for g in graphs.nauty_geng("12 16:16 -Ct")]
sage: for _ in range(20):
....:     for g in G:
....:         A = g.incidence_matrix()
....:         M = Matroid(A, ring = GF(2))
....:         if M.is_connected():
....:             pass
....:     print(get_memory_usage())
....:     
8539.23046875
8543.7421875
8547.73828125
8551.734375
8555.73046875
8559.59765625
8563.59375
8566.9453125
8570.94140625
8574.9375
8578.2890625
8582.28515625
8586.15234375
8589.6328125
8593.62890625
8597.49609375
8600.9765625
8604.84375
8608.83984375
8612.3203125
```

The memory leak is because `sig_free` is missing.
