I believe you can change `(-b.q().lift().valuation(p)/2).ceil()` to `((-b.q().lift().valuation(p)+1) // 2)`, which will avoid going through `QQ`.

Also, I don't understand the logic behind `_compute_representative`. Why not make `representative` a `@cached_method`? You also do not have public access to the `LLL` option, nor is it used anywhere. If you still want to keep it and use the `@cached_method`, you can do

```python
@cached_method
def representative(self, LLL=True):
    if LLL:
        rep = self.representative(LLL=False)
        return result_of_LLL
    return computation_of_represenative
```
Although this does have a drawback of storing both the representatives in memory.

Could you make the `# long time` doctest a little shorter, say, maybe only to `15`? 40s is a little long IMO.

The reason why I did not use the cached_method decorator is that

```
sage: Genus(matrix(ZZ,[1]))
Genus of
[1]
Signature:  (1, 0)
Genus symbol at 2:    [1^1]_1
```
stores the representative matrix at object creation in `_representative`.
So it is an optional argument in the genus class. 
Can this be achieved (better?) with `cached_method` as well?
