It's reported in [this thread on sage-devel https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/OJJFRAgvtqk/JZMEdA81EAAJ]
that "wrong" libraries in /lib may shadow the "right" one in SAGE_LOCAL/lib for eclib (this happens with libpari)

It appears to be due to `--with-flint=""` being passed instead of
`--with-flint` in spkg-install of eclib, adding a spurrous `-L/lib` to the `ld` search path for building eclib
