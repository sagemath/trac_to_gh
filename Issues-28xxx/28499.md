`typing` is a standard Sage package but it is also included in Python 3.7 standard library. This module is not compatible with Python > 3.5. For example it breaks pytest

```
  File "/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py", line 6, in <module>
    from _pytest.assertion import rewrite
  File "/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py", line 15, in <module>
    from typing import Dict
  File "/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/typing.py", line 1356, in <module>
    class Callable(extra=collections_abc.Callable, metaclass=CallableMeta):
  File "/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/typing.py", line 1004, in __new__
    self._abc_registry = extra._abc_registry
AttributeError: type object 'Callable' has no attribute '_abc_registry'
FAIL eantic_sage.py (exit status: 1)
```

We should disable the installation of typing when Sage is built with Python 3.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
There is another way.  With an `spkg-configure.m4`, in I believe the third argument to [https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/m4/sage_spkg_configure.m4 SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` you can pass a check for whether the package is even required.

It's not well documented how to do this, but if you set sage_require_typing=no in this check then it won't require installation of the package (it will just be treated as a dummy package).
