This ticket implements the following changes to the class `HyperplaneArrangementElement`:

* In the method `is_central`, add the argument `certificate=False`. If set to `True`, this will additionally return the center of the arrangement. The center is easily obtainable as a byproduct of the existing calculation. 
* Add the method `center()`. This will return the center of the arrangement as computed by `is_central(certificate=True)`.

Here are few schönheitssachen:

- space after comma in the definition (pep8 conventions...)

- swap `(default: False)` and `boolean` in the docstring

- I would use the verb return instead of include

- `is_central` needs the appropriate doctests checking all possibilities.

- `center` needs an example when the hyperplane arrangement is not central.

I would suggest to use the Polyhedra parents and then return `.universe()` and `.empty()` which are less costly to execute in principle.

No need of a bullet list for one element:

```diff
-        If ``certificate`` is False:
-
-        - A boolean
+        If ``certificate`` is ``False``, returns a boolean
```

- Missing empty lines before the doctests (in both functions).

- I would shorten the output of `center` to simply say that it is a polyhedron. If you want to be explicit, I would do it in the longer description before input/output.

I noted another small thing:

```
+        If ``certificate`` is True, returns a tuple containing:

```

True and False should be between two back ticks... Otherwise, looks good. Just waiting that bots go over it again...

A little doc change:

```diff
         - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); specifies whether
-        to return the center as a polyhedron (possibly empty) as part of the 
-        output.
           to return the center as a polyhedron (possibly empty) as part
           of the output
```
(Note also the lack of a period/full-stop and the removal of the trailing whitespace.)

Also, because of the `@cached_method`, there is no reason to do the computation twice. Constructing the certificate seems quite cheap to me, so I might instead put as the first lines:

```
if not certificate:
    return self.is_central(True)[0]
```
and then assume `certificate=True` for the rest. However, this really depends on how expensive that `right_kernel` is and how often you think the certificate will be requested. There is a balance to be had here and a judgement call to be made. I am just saying this is an alternative way to avoid doing the main computation twice should you ask for with a certificate and without.

As Travis wrote, there are two lines to be inserted and some lines to be deleted, that would be all. If you think the additional computation time for the `right_kernel` and the construction of the `Polyhedron` aren't slowing down `is_central` too much, I could do it.

I would say it is fine yes. 

Unless you find an example where you have tons of hyperplanes (10 000+) I don't think it will take too much time. Just for the record, if speed is really important, you could benchmark the before and after for some relatively big example just to have an idea...

Hi Julian,

Are you going to do the suggested changes? It looks ok to me either way.

Hi, I forgot about implementing the suggested changes. If you ask me like that, I would prefer the way it is written right now.
