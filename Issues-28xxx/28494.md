So the question is: when #28000 will be applied ?

Subidiary question : shouldn't this be a dependency of #28000 ?

<a id='comment:5'></a>I am of two minds about whether waiting for #28000:

* ISTR that 2.8.6 is the last version supporting Python 2. However, [Pipy](https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/#history) mentions releases version 2.9.0 to 2.9.6b0, the latter being marked as a pre-release for the 3.0.0 bersion released the day after 2.9.6b0 release...

* What is the increment in functionality that upgrading 2.8.2 --> 2.8.6 gives us ?
* How expensive (in terms of workload) it is ?

In other words, given our limited resources, isn't it better to wait for a Python-3 based Sagemath and go directly to `rpy2 3.1` ?
