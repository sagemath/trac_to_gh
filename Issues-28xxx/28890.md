As pointed out [on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ON2MC0n2iUE/Qt4axoa0AQAJ), by default many SPKGs install static libraries in addition to their associated dynamic libs.

I usually ignored this as harmless, but as Marc pointed out, some of them are quite large, especially libgiac.a.  Almost none of these are actually needed either at build or runtime and do not need to be installed by default in SAGE_LOCAL.

I think by default we should configure the relevant packages to *not* install static libs, or remove them manually if the packages' build system installs them forcibly.  This could be overridden with `<PKGNAME>_CONFIGURE` variables if someone needs the static lib for some reason.

At least the following packages are installing static libs

```
$ for f in local/var/lib/sage/installed/*; do if grep '\.a\"' "$f" > /dev/null; then echo "$f" | cut -d'/' -f6; fi; done
cddlib-0.94j
cliquer-1.21.p4
e_antic-0.1.3
ecl-16.1.2.p5
eclib-20190909
ecm-7.0.4.p1
fplll-5.2.1
freetype-2.9.1
gap-4.10.2.p1
gc-7.6.4.p0
gf2x-1.2.p0
giac-1.5.0.63.p0
givaro-4.1.1
gsl-2.5
iml-1.0.4p1.p2
libatomic_ops-7.6.2
libgd-2.1.1.1.p1
libpng-1.6.29.p1
lrcalc-1.2.p1
mpc-1.1.0
mpfi-1.5.2
mpfr-4.0.1.p0
mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
ncurses-6.0.p0
normaliz-3.7.2
ntl-11.3.2
numpy-1.16.1
pari-2.11.1.p2
planarity-3.0.0.5.p0
ppl-1.2.p1
python2-2.7.15.p1
python3-3.7.3.p1
ratpoints-2.1.3.p5
rw-0.7.p0
singular-4.1.1p2.p0
sqlite-3290000
symmetrica-2.0.p11
yasm-1.3.0.p0
zeromq-4.2.5
zlib-1.2.11.p0
```

In at least a few cases, like `libatomic_ops`, I believe this is intentional.  But in most cases it is probably unnecessary.

Additional notes:

* cliquer: it already passes `--disable-static` but it installs a test file into `share/` which happens to end with `.a` but is not a static lib as far as I can tell.

* ecl: The `.a` modules installed with ECL seem to be pretty baked into its build process and I'm not sure if there's an easy way to omit them or if it's even desirable to.

* ecm: apparently we deliberately build it as a static lib by default; not sure why.  Need to investigate (performance reasons?)

* gap: The SmallGrp package also installs some ".a" file that are not static libs; otherwise GAP is not installing any static libs (some things in gap_packages might but I haven't checked yet).

* mpir: mpir/gmp is linked statically for at least some libraries such as ECM, and possibly some others (GP?).

* ntl: NTL's build system makes static library installation pretty mandatory--I don't know if there's any good reason for that or not, so for now we can just leave it alone.

* python2/3: The static lib installation (performed by the `libainstall` make target) is a part of Python's standard installation process and more trouble to remove than it's worth, although I don't think we explicitly need it for anything.

* ratpoints: Has only ever supported being built as a static library, and is statically linked into Sage's ratpoints interface.

* yasm: If I understand correctly, libyasm contains some special support functions and is intended to be linked statically.

Passing `--disable-static` to all autoconf-compatible packages by default takes care of most of them, narrowing the list down to:

```
ecl-16.1.2.p5
ecm-7.0.4.p1
libatomic_ops-7.6.2
mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
ntl-11.3.2
numpy-1.16.1
pari-2.11.1.p2
python2-2.7.15.p1
python3-3.7.3.p1
ratpoints-2.1.3.p5
symmetrica-2.0.p11
yasm-1.3.0.p0
```

Left libatomic_ops static since I think gc likes to link to it statically for performance reasons, but I need to double-check that it's actually doing that.

The rest I'm not sure about yet.

Thanks a lot for taking care of that. (You are crossing an item off the depths of my todo-list!)

I just rebuilt sage from scratch with this branch. With standard packages only and using system packages when possible, the remaining static libraries are

```
107M    ./local/lib/libpari.a
48M     ./local/lib/libsymmetrica.a
31M     ./local/lib/python3.7/config-3.7m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.7m.a
7,7M    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libcmp.a
7,5M    ./local/lib/libbraiding.a
5,4M    ./local/lib/libyasm.a
4,5M    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libasdf.a
3,1M    ./local/lib/libecm.a
880K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libdefsystem.a
564K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libdeflate.a
448K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libsockets.a
372K    ./local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/lib/libnpymath.a
232K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libecl-help.a
200K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libprofile.a
184K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/librt.a
176K    ./local/lib/libratpoints.a
172K    ./local/lib/libhomfly.a
172K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libecl-cdb.a
140K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libecl-curl.a
132K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libserve-event.a
132K    ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libql-minitar.a
96K     ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libecl-quicklisp.a
72K     ./local/lib/ecl-16.1.2/libsb-bsd-sockets.a
32K     ./local/lib/libatomic_ops_gpl.a
24K     ./local/lib/libatomic_ops.a
```
So most of the large ones are gone, and those that remain may have a good reason to be there. Like Dima, I'm ready to give this branch positive review if you want.

Updated to remove libpari.a.  Apparently we had been explicitly installing it pretty much forever, so I couldn't find a clear record of *why*, but I don't think there's any need for it currently.

My only concern here is there no easy way (since it is not a flag that can be passed to PARI_CONFIGURE) to force installation of the static lib.  But if someone asks for it for some reason it can be added later.

If so, it appears we are already *not* doing this, though we could.  Regardless, this can be done during PARI/GP build: there is no need to install the static lib after the fact.

On OS X (with a bunch of homebrew packages), this prevents building of the following:

```
libbraiding.a
libcdd.a
libcddgmp.a
libec.a
libecm.a
libfplll.a
libgf2x.a
libgivaro.a
libhomfly.a
libiml.a
liblrcalc.a
libpari.a
libplanarity.a
libratpoints.a
librw.a
libsymmetrica.a
```
`libecm.a` and `libratpoints.a` are still built, as it says in the ticket description.

We should probably build without as many homebrew packages, to make sure things still work.
