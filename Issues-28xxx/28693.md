Thanks. The new release is not yet declared on github.

I am positive, but at least one other opinion is required.

Is there a tarball on pypi or somewhere else than the sage mirror? I see there is no release tarball on github and I'd rather use something that is properly released to create a package for gentoo. Not that github tarballs are always reliable (https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/529) which is why pypi is preferable.
