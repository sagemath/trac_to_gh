Follow up to #28242 which introduced `SAGE_PARI_CFG` in documentation build to identity whether or not pari is external.

This is inconvenient to distros and the behavior for external `pari` should be assumed if `SAGE_PARI_CFG` is undefined.

using SAGE_PARI_CFG in docbuild is a hack.
One should really test whether the external pari is multithreaded, this is something that can be done, I just didn't do. 

SAGE_PARI_CFG is storing the location of pari.cfg, something hard to find out, and needed to install gp2c, see https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/build/pkgs/gp2c/spkg-configure.m4?id=46772dbb31f2be940bda299136455f495c6a21dc

This is the value I *set*. But you can just unconditionally switch to the appropriate docbuilder in Gentoo.
