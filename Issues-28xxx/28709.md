We don't need to specify the Python executable as `sage-python` in `doctest/control.py`, and it's better for distros and in general to not do so.

This is a followup to #28657.

Not with #28657. (There is a `python3` but no `python`.)

It's curious. If I do `./sage -t src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx > TEST.log`, there is no segfault, but if I don't redirect output, there is. It looks like this:

> The segfaulting behavior is most curious. From what you say it sounds like some memory context may be at play. Much more complex than just this ticket.

I agree it's weird, but since it's on a virtual machine that's a little flaky already, I don't know how seriously to take it.
