We don't need to specify the Python executable as `sage-python` in `doctest/control.py`, and it's better for distros and in general to not do so.

This is a followup to #28657.

Not with #28657. (There is a `python3` but no `python`.)

It's curious. If I do `./sage -t src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx > TEST.log`, there is no segfault, but if I don't redirect output, there is. It looks like this:

> The segfaulting behavior is most curious. From what you say it sounds like some memory context may be at play. Much more complex than just this ticket.

By the way, on a virtual machine on a different computer, I don't see the segfault, just the usual numerical noise failures.

Basic testing with python2 and python3 OK. I believe the segfault mentioned here is unrelated and may deserve wider scrutiny on sage-devel because it is definitely on the weirder side of things.

I agree it's weird, but since it's on a virtual machine that's a little flaky already, I don't know how seriously to take it.
