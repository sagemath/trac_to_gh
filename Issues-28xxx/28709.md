We don't need to specify the Python executable as `sage-python` in `doctest/control.py`, and it's better for distros and in general to not do so.

This is a followup to #28657.

Not with #28657. (There is a `python3` but no `python`.)

It's curious. If I do `./sage -t src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx > TEST.log`, there is no segfault, but if I don't redirect output, there is. It looks like this:

By the way, on a virtual machine on a different computer, I don't see the segfault, just the usual numerical noise failures.
