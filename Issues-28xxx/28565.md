This ticket improves the introspection for the Macaulay2 interface:

• `help` is now called with a Macaulay2 string instead of a symbol, as this works in more generality, for example for global variables:
  {{{
  sage: macaulay2.errorDepth?
  }}}

• The class `Macaulay2FunctionElement` of functions with applied first argument is implemented. This allows to make the help and source code more specific by taking into account the first argument. For example the following only shows the relevant output for `Ideal`, but not for `Matrix` or `Module`.
  {{{
  sage: I = macaulay2('ideal 4')
  sage: I.resolution?
  sage: I.resolution??
  }}}

  The `__getattr__` of `Macaulay2` is removed as it is not needed anymore since `_function_class` is implemented.

• The `_sage_src_` of `Macaulay2Function` is simplified. This also fixes an issue where all the lines are shown with a special end character `^M` when inspecting Macaulay2 source code as in:
  {{{
  sage: macaulay2.matrix??
  code(methods matrix)^M
  ^M
  o1000000008 = -- code for method: matrix(List)^M
  ...
  }}}

• The `nodetex` and `noreplace` directives for Sage documentation are added to avoid reformatting of the Macaulay2 documentation. Previously one would get
  {{{
  sage: macaulay2.matrix?
  ...
  +------------------------------+
  | i1 : matrix{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}} |
  | o1 = | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 |  2    |
  | 3  o1 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ   |
  +------------------------------+
  ...
  }}}
  instead of
  {{{
  +----------------------------+
  |i1 : matrix{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}|
  |                            |
  |o1 = | 1 2 3 |              |
  |     | 4 5 6 |              |
  |                            |
  |              2        3    |
  |o1 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ     |
  +----------------------------+
  }}}
