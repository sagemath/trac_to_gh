As discussed in #28331, specifically ticket:28331#comment:9, the `Manifold` constructor uses `unique_tag=getrandbits(128)*time()` to ensure all returned manifolds are unique instances.

I'm not exactly sure why `time()` is used, except for the fact that in the doctests, the random seed is reset to 0 (so the `getrandbits` is not useful from test case to case case).  However, on some systems `time()` is not high-enough resolution to change from case to case as well.

Perhaps it would be better to either use a different random number that is not re-seeded.  Or use a monotonic clock or even just a monotonically increasing integer for each manifold...?

Yes the use of `time()` was only a (bad!) attempt to guarantee uniqueness. Combining it with `getrandbits(128)` was naively thought as a security in case two successive calls of `time()` occur with a time separation too small to be resolved.
The use of the monotonically increasing integer as in you implemented in the above commit seems a much more robust solution. 

In the long term, I think we should get rid of the `UniqueRepresentation` for manifolds, except for those that do have a mathematically meaningful unique representation, like `EuclideanSpace`. Having manifolds inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` was a hack to make pickling work easily, which is required for parallelized computations via `multiprocessing`.

Well, this was some time ago and I have to figure out again what the problems were...
Basically, manifolds are objects that are constructed on the fly, with the user adding open subsets, charts and vector frames at any time.
