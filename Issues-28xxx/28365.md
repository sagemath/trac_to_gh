As discussed in #28331, specifically [#28331 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/28331#comment:9), the `Manifold` constructor uses `unique_tag=getrandbits(128)*time()` to ensure all returned manifolds are unique instances.

I'm not exactly sure why `time()` is used, except for the fact that in the doctests, the random seed is reset to 0 (so the `getrandbits` is not useful from test case to case case).  However, on some systems `time()` is not high-enough resolution to change from case to case as well.

Perhaps it would be better to either use a different random number that is not re-seeded.  Or use a monotonic clock or even just a monotonically increasing integer for each manifold...?

LGTM. Thanks!

Does this solve the issue with !Cygwin/Windows 7 reported in [#28331 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/28331#comment:5) ? If yes, it seems to me that `getrandbits` is somehow broken on this computer, because it should have solved the degeneracy in `time()`: in the same session, two successive calls to `getrandbits(128)` are very unlikely to return the same value, aren't they?

Well, this was some time ago and I have to figure out again what the problems were...
Basically, manifolds are objects that are constructed on the fly, with the user adding open subsets, charts and vector frames at any time.

When running tests, the doctesting framework resets the random seed
to 0 at each new doctest, in order to ensure reproducibility of doctests!
