In this ticket, I am going to fix the implementation of the method `dim` of `PolyhedronFace`. This problem occurs when we have a vertex and a ray (or a line) with the same vector.
See the following example.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0]], rays=[[1,0],[0,1]]); P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 2 rays
sage: P.faces(P.dim())[0]
A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 2 rays
```
