In order to make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron`, we replace `ridge_graph` by `facet_graph`.

In case of of the half space this makes a difference, as there is a facet, but no ridges.

For now we keep `ridge_graph` and add a deprecation warning.

While we are at it, we fix some bugs:

- `CombinatorialPolyhedron.ridges(names=False, add_equalities=True)` ignores `add_equalities=True` now.

  Equalities do not carry indices and can only be added with `names=True`.
- `facet_graph` is now aware of the following:
  a ridge in `ridges` is a tuple of indices with `names=False` and a tuple of tuples with `names=True` and `add_equalities=True`,

  e.g. `(1,2)` vs. `(('my_vertex_1',), ('my_vertex_2',))`.
- `ridges` now appends equations at the end. This is consistent with `FaceIterator.Hrepresentation`.

Depends on #28603

`facet_graph` does not work for non-full-dimensional polyhedra:

```
    sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(polytopes.hypersimplex(5,2)); C
    A 4-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 10 facets
    sage: C.facet_graph()
    Graph on 20 vertices
```
The problem arises since each facet in `C.ridges(names=True, add_equalities=True)` is represented as (equation, inequality), while in `C.face_iter(C.dimension() - 1, dual=False))`, each facet is represented as (inequality, equation).

`facet_graph` does not work when `names=False`:

```
    sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(polytopes.cube()); C
    A 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 6 facets
    sage: C.facet_graph(names=False)
    Graph on 12 vertices
```
The problem arises since`facet.Hrepr(names=False)` returns a tuple, for example `(5,)`. While in `C.ridges(names=False)`, each facet is represented by a number.

 For now we keep `ridge_graph` and add a deprecation warning.
 
-While we are at it, we fix a bug, where `CombinatorialPolyhedron.ridges(names=False, add_equalities=True)` lead to nonsense output (the equalities do not carry indices and hence can only be added with `names=True`).
+While we are at it, we fix some bugs:
 
-Also there are two bugs regarding the representing ridges as facet-indices and inequalites/equalities:
+- `CombinatorialPolyhedron.ridges(names=False, add_equalities=True)` ignores `add_equalities=True` now.
 
-1. Ridges returns a tuple of indices with `names=False` and a tuple of tuple with `names=True` and `add_equalities=True`.
-2. Ridges and FaceIterator.Hrepresentation should return inequalities/equalities in the same order, namely ordered by indices and append inequalities at the end.
+  Equalities do not carry indices and can only be added with `names=True`.
+- `facet_graph` is now aware of the following:
+  a ridge in `ridges` is a tuple of indices with `names=False` and a tuple of tuples with `names=True` and `add_equalities=True`,

+  e.g. `(1,2)` vs. `(('my_vertex_1',), ('my_vertex_2',))`.
