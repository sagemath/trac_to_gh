Unfortunately this doesn't really work as intended. The reason why the imp import is an issue with ipython 7 is that, unlike ipython 5, it displays the python deprecation warnings, which makes many tests fail.

With this patch, `from imp import reload` still succeeds (imp hasn't been removed yet even in 3.8, it is just deprecated), so instead of using impotlib, it still shows the deprecation warnings and tests fail.
