At least I checked reverting to `p_WTotaldegree` solves the present problem. But there must have been some reason to have used `p_WDegree`.

The reason for that change seems to be to fix the example in [ticket:17254#comment:199] where a matrix ordering is used. Interestingly though, with current versions of Singular, the degree with a matrix ordering is not based on the first row of the matrix anymore:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0])))
sage: [a.degree() for a in R.gens()]
[3, 0, 1]
sage: [a._singular_().deg() for a in R.gens()]
[3, 0, 1]   # singular 3.1.7p1
[1, 1, 1]   # singular 4.1.1p2
```

Therefore, I think the degree function in Sage should be changed to return results consistent with Singular in case of matrix orderings. Based on [this document](https://github.com/Singular/Sources/blob/ed085278a0d1c84d197cb3b6dea54a2e5cbabdc0/libpolys/polys/monomials/degree.txt), I replaced `p_WDegree` by `p_FDeg`, which fixes both examples here â€“ though I am not completely certain this is the correct function to call.

I guess such a behavior change would need a deprecation period. How would one implement this in practice?

I am quite certain that the best thing to do is to patch `polynomial.pyx` such that

```
cdef long singular_polynomial_deg(poly *p, poly *x, ring *r):
    ...
    if x == NULL:
        return p_WTotaldegree(p,r)

    cdef int i = 0
    ...
```
Note that the "loop" thing is not necessary. So this will speed up things.

But then we get 

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, order=TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0])))
sage: [a.degree() for a in R.gens()]
[-3, 0, -1]
sage: [a._singular_().deg() for a in R.gens()]
[1, 1, 1]
```
I don't care the Singular degrees. They are  `p_Totaldegree` (via `p_FDeg` via `p_LDeg`), as expected since Singular' deg function calls `p_LDeg`.

I wish to remove the loop thing for the cases when the monomial ordering is compatible with the degrees, to speed up Sage polynomial arithmetic. But I don't know how to detect these cases, and this issue is for another ticket.

Perhaps we need to delay this ticket until the fix in Singular is available in Sage...

This would be a practical thing to do, as it leaves it to Singular to provide an efficient implementation. Note that this only affects matrix orderings with zeros in the first row â€“ if the entries in the first row are positive, these are returned as degrees as before.

> Should we not add the upstream fix as a patch here? The regular upgrade of Singular might still take quite a while.


If we do not wait the regular upgrade of Singular, the upstream fix should go to the Singular package of Sage, as a patch (and be removed when the regular upgrade arrives). I guess this is not a good thing to do.

After looking into the implementation of `p_LDeg` in Singular and some experiments, it seems that `p_LDeg` is not that faster than the loop thing with `p_WTotaldegree` as I expected initially. 

Then I don't see any advantage of using `p_LDeg` while introducing a backward incompatible change in regard to matrix orderings.

I would prefer the present branch and bear with the bug until Singular gets the regular upgrade.

Ok, if we use `p_LDeg`, we do not actually need the upstream fix.

Could you add a doctest for the example in the ticket description, please? Also, I think we should keep one example of a matrix ordering with zeros in the first row, in order to document the fact that standard grading is now used in that case.

Finally, the imports `p_Deg, p_Totaldegree, p_WTotaldegree, p_WDegree` are not used anymore and could be removed.

Otherwise, this looks good to me. Thanks a lot for the comparisons and the fix.

Right.

Done.
