```

This is by design, as it is hard to guess the users intentions:
- Exact computations should only be done in `AA` for exploratory work, as it is precise but possibly very slow. Exact conversion to `AA` works:

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: AA(sqrt2)
1.414213562373095?
sage: AA(sqrt2) == AA(2).sqrt()
True
```
- Otherwise, exact computations should be done in a good common number field, e.g. using `composite_fields`:

```
sage: K2.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: K3.<sqrt3> = QuadraticField(3)
sage: K = K2.composite_fields(K3)[0]
sage: K(sqrt2)
-1/2*sqrt2sqrt3^3 + 9/2*sqrt2sqrt3
sage: K(sqrt3)
-1/2*sqrt2sqrt3^3 + 11/2*sqrt2sqrt3
sage: K
Number Field in sqrt2sqrt3 with defining polynomial x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1 with sqrt2sqrt3 = 0.3178372451957823?
```
  However, there is a choice involved in picking the common number field, which is up to the user.
- Also there is reliable fast but imprecise float calculations. Number fields can be coerced into the reals, but this wouldn't be a good choice for a canonical common parent of two number fields.

-We embed the `QuadraticField` into `AA` or `QQbar` by default and therefore fix this for the real algebraic case.
+This can be fixed by hand, when embedding both fields into `AA` (instead of default `RLF`):
 
-Possible follow ups:
-- It still does not work in the non-real case, but this should be taken care of in `NumberField` instead.
-- Also, one could argue, whether the coercion should really go all the way to `AA`, but this is also not an issue of `QuadraticField`.
+```

+```
+
+So I think, quadratic fields should by default be embedded into `AA`/`QQbar`. However, this causes a lot of tests to fail mainly for two reasons:
+- numerical approximation for `AA` works differently than in `RLF`,
+- coercion of cyclotomic fields and quadratic fields seems to rely on a common embedding (either one has to embed cyclotomic fields into `QQbar` by default or one needs to manually fix the coercion)
+
+There is a branch attached with several failing tests, mostly because of the above two issues.

This is the best I can come up with.

To my understanding coercion of two number fields is only possible, if they are both embedded into `AA` (or `QQbar` with #28778) or if there is an embedding (discovered by `_internal_coerce_map_from`).

Raising an error or a warning does not work, as it is being suppressed.

This depends on #28778 now, as this fixes an error (along the way), where the pushout of two number fields embedded into `RLF` is `AA`. This ticket relies on the method `_pushout_` to return `None` in this case.

I posted about this on sage-devel https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oSFceE75pWU/K-akRxS6BAAJ.

At the moment it looks like there isn't much interest. I'll wait a day and if nothing shows up, we can just close this here as invalid.
