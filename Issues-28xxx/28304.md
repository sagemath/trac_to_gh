In Macaulay2, the `AfterPrint` is responsible for adding useful type information about computed results. Since this information generally cannot be obtained easily otherwise, it should be added to the `_repr_` of Macaulay2 elements. Compare for example

```
sage: macaulay2.eval('kernel matrix {{1, 2}, {3, 6}}')
image | 2  |
      | -1 |

                          2
ZZ-module, submodule of ZZ
```
to

```
sage: macaulay2(matrix([[1, 2], [3, 6]])).kernel()
image | 2  |
      | -1 |
sage: _.cls()  # this is much less informative
Module
```

We discussed this issue at the IMA a few weeks ago. Dima suggested that including type information in the `repr` by default is not pythonic, but that Macaulay2 elements should have a method to access this kind of information instead. I think it would still be useful to be able to optionally enable printing this info, as this is what Macaulay2 does by default.

Here is a branch implementing both. It adds a method `after_print_text()` to obtain this type info from within Sage. Moreover, it adds an option `macaulay2.options.after_print='yes'` (`'no'` by default) to append the AfterPrint text to the `repr` of Macaulay2 elements. This option can then be enabled in the `init.sage` file, for example.

```
sage: m = macaulay2(matrix([[1, 2], [3, 6]])); m
sage: m.after_print_text()
         2        2
Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ
sage: macaulay2.options.after_print = 'yes'
sage: m
| 1 2 |
| 3 6 |
| 1 2 |
| 3 6 |

         2        2
Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ
```

I completely agree with this. The problem is that `sage.structure.global_options` only seems to work with options of type string, but booleans do not work. I have not looked much into it yet, so cannot say how difficult it is to change this, but will report back once I know more.

That is wrong. See `combinat/partition.py`:

```
        diagram_str = dict(default="*",
                         description='The character used for the cells when printing Ferrers diagrams',
                         checker=lambda char: isinstance(char,str))
```
So use

```
        after_print = dict(default=True,
                           description='Print more stuff',
                           checker=lambda val: isinstance(val, bool))
```
