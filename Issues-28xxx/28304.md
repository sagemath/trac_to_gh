In Macaulay2, the `AfterPrint` is responsible for adding useful type information about computed results. Since this information generally cannot be obtained easily otherwise, it should be added to the `_repr_` of Macaulay2 elements. Compare for example

```
sage: macaulay2.eval('kernel matrix {{1, 2}, {3, 6}}')
image | 2  |
      | -1 |

                          2
ZZ-module, submodule of ZZ
```
to

```
sage: macaulay2(matrix([[1, 2], [3, 6]])).kernel()
image | 2  |
      | -1 |
sage: _.cls()  # this is much less informative
Module
```

That is wrong. See `combinat/partition.py`:

```
        diagram_str = dict(default="*",
                         description='The character used for the cells when printing Ferrers diagrams',
                         checker=lambda char: isinstance(char,str))
```
So use

```
        after_print = dict(default=True,
                           description='Print more stuff',
                           checker=lambda val: isinstance(val, bool))
```
