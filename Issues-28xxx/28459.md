the external install should have `glpsol` and `libglpk`

On debian they are in `glpk-utils` and `libglpk-dev` packages.

`4ti2` needs to know its prefix (or probably just `--with-glpk` should be there). 
Anyhow, we introduce a new env. var. `SAGE_GLPK_PREFIX`
which is `''` for system's `glpk` and `SAGE_LOCAL` otherwise. 

`cvxopt` for its `glpk` extension needs to know the (non-standard) include directory and
library directory of `glpk`, so they can be made blank 
for the stanard locations --- but as in particular libPython comes from `SAGE_LOCAL`, this should be left unchanged for the time being.

---
Sage's `glpk` needs a specific patch which is not upstreamed, so we need to work this out, too.
