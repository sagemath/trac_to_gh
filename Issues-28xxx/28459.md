the external install should have `glpsol` and `libglpk`

On debian they are in `glpk-utils` and `libglpk-dev` packages.

`4ti2` needs to know its prefix (or probably just `--with-glpk` should be there). 
Anyhow, we introduce a new env. var. `SAGE_GLPK_PREFIX`
which is `''` for system's `glpk` and `SAGE_LOCAL` otherwise. 

`cvxopt` for its `glpk` extension needs to know the (non-standard) include directory and
library directory of `glpk`, so they can be made blank 
for the stanard locations --- but as in particular libPython comes from `SAGE_LOCAL`, this should be left unchanged for the time being.

---
Sage's `glpk` needs a specific patch which is not upstreamed, so we need to work this out, too.

Same for Arch. Given that 4.65 is 1.5 years old and most distros are shipping it already, IMO it would be best to update sage's glpk first before dealing with this.

On #24824 I've also adjusted tests so ithat only one test fails with Debian's glpk 4.65, which does not apply one of Sage's patches, `glpk/patches/error_recovery.patch`. 

(And in fact the still failing test can be switched off or changed into something that does not need the patch in question).
