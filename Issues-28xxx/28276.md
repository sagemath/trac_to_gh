In sage/combinat/output.py tex_from_skew_array, a format command is used in the format "format string {}"%var, which formats var correctly if var is a non-tuple type but interprets var as multiple format parameters if var is a tuple and fails.

By changing the format of the command to "format string {}"%(var,) this functionality is fixed.

This fix is required for proper output of tuple-valued tableau to use the latex code in output.py

Keywords: bugfix, tableau, tableaux
