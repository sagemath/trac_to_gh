Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field K.  Then E.torsion_subgroup() returns its torsion subgroup T,a finite abelian group with at most two generators, proceeding in two steps:
1. Compute a bound B for (a multiple of) #T.
2. For each p dividing B find the p-torsion then the p-power torsion then combine.
For step 1 we reduce E mod P for several primes P chosen such that the reduction map is injective on T, compute the cardinality of E mod P and take the gcd.  The current implementation finds the primes P using K.primes_above(p) for rational primes p, which in turn requires (as currently implemented) knowing the maximal order in K, and this can be prohibitively expensive.  (In current work I have fields K of degree 16 defined by polynomials whose discriminant has hundreds of digits, and the computation sometimes  does not finish even after several hours.)

The proposed improvement makes the computation of B trivially fast.  Assume for simplicity that K is defined by a monic polynomial f(X) in ZZ[X] and that the defining coefficients of E are in ZZ[a] where a is a root of f.  (The implementation will of course handle the general case.)  Take odd rational primes p not dividing disc(f) or the norm of cond(E).  The one can find the primes P above p simply by factoring f(X) mod p; to each factor f_i of degree d_i take a root a_i of f mod p and reduce E by mapping a to a_i, then compute its cardinality.  (We have avoided any p which are ramified in K or for which the order ZZ[a] is not p-maximal.)

A useful simplification is possible when E is actually defined over QQ (which is the case for my current project, where I have implemented this).  Now the cardinalities we need (whose gcd gives B) are just E.reduction(p).cardinality(extension_degree=d_i) as d_i runs over the degrees of the factors of f mod p.

My implementation of the special case has already been running over several million cases with deg(f) up to 21.

I moved the torsion_bound function into ell_torsion.py (it used to be a method _torsion_bound of the elliptic curve class).

The code divides into 3 cases: (1) base field QQ, (2) base field not QQ but all a-invariants in QQ, (3) general.  It would be possible to extend (2) to cover any curve which is isomorphic to a base_change.
