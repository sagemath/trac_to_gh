The following innocent code leads sage to crash hard.

```
sage: P = polytopes.dodecahedron(backend='normaliz')
sage: P.volume(measure='induced_lattice')
```

The problem is that we use the wrong method. We use
`P._nmz_result(cone, 'Volume')` but we should use `P._nmz_result(cone, 'RenfVolume')`.

I don't know if that helps you:

If I remember correctly, the problem is just that C++ allows multiple inputs but only one output. So for `Cone<Integer>` one should use `getVolume` and for `Cone<renf_elem_class>` one should use `getRenfVolume`. This is the corresponding code in normaliz (https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/source/libnormaliz/cone.cpp)

```
template <typename Integer>
mpq_class Cone<Integer>::getVolume() {
    compute(ConeProperty::Volume);
    return volume;
}

template <typename Integer>
renf_elem_class Cone<Integer>::getRenfVolume() {
    assert(false);
    return {};
}

#ifdef ENFNORMALIZ
template <>
mpq_class Cone<renf_elem_class>::getVolume() {
    assert(false);
    return 0;
}

template <>
renf_elem_class Cone<renf_elem_class>::getRenfVolume() {
    compute(ConeProperty::RenfVolume);
    return renf_volume;
}
#endif
```

This is also spelled out in the manual https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf in section D.9

At present, calling 

```
getVolume()

for a cone of renf_elem_class results in an 

```
assert(false)
```

As a first measurte, I will replace the assert(false) by throwing a NonComputableExcetion. It is caught by PyNormaliz. (The disadvantage of exceptions is that they cannot be traced back.)

The assert(false) has been replaced by an exception. There should be no assert(false) in public methods of the class Cone anymore.
