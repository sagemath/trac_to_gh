The following innocent code leads sage to crash hard.

```
sage: P = polytopes.dodecahedron(backend='normaliz')
sage: P.volume(measure='induced_lattice')
```

The problem is that we use the wrong method. We use
`P._nmz_result(cone, 'Volume')` but we should use `P._nmz_result(cone, 'RenfVolume')`.

I don't know if that helps you:

If I remember correctly, the problem is just that C++ allows multiple inputs but only one output. So for `Cone<Integer>` one should use `getVolume` and for `Cone<renf_elem_class>` one should use `getRenfVolume`. This is the corresponding code in normaliz (https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/source/libnormaliz/cone.cpp)

```
template <typename Integer>
mpq_class Cone<Integer>::getVolume() {
    compute(ConeProperty::Volume);
    return volume;
}

template <typename Integer>
renf_elem_class Cone<Integer>::getRenfVolume() {
    assert(false);
    return {};
}

#ifdef ENFNORMALIZ
template <>
mpq_class Cone<renf_elem_class>::getVolume() {
    assert(false);
    return 0;
}

template <>
renf_elem_class Cone<renf_elem_class>::getRenfVolume() {
    compute(ConeProperty::RenfVolume);
    return renf_volume;
}
#endif
```

This is also spelled out in the manual https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf in section D.9

> In return values Integer must be specialized to renf_elem_class . A special return value is > the volume
> that in general is no longer of type mpq_class . It is retrieved by
> renf_elem_class Cone<renf_elem_class>::getRenfVolume().

The assert(false) has been replaced by an exception. There should be no assert(false) in public methods of the class Cone anymore.

Pushed to [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) branch master.
