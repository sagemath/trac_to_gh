The methods `lawrence extension` and `lawrence_polytope` of `Polyhedron` do not work when the backend is `field`.

```
P = Polyhedron([[1,3], [3,4]], backend="field")
P.lawrence_extension([10,20])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```

We fix this by properly initializing them with zero rays/lines instead of `None`.
