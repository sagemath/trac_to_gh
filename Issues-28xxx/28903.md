This ticket implements conversions to Sympy of elements of `ComplexField`, `CDF` and `QuadraticNumberField(-1)`. This solves some inconsistencies with the unicode art of symbolic expressions involving complex numbers.

Most symbolic expressions use the Sympy symbol `ⅈ` for the unicode art of the imaginary unit, but some do not:

```
sage: unicode_art(sqrt(3) * I)  # correct
√3⋅ⅈ
sage: unicode_art(I)  # should use symbol ⅈ
I
sage: unicode_art(cos(I)), cos(I)  # should render the same
(1.54308063481524, cosh(1))
sage: unicode_art(SR(CC(1/3 + I)))  # should use symbol ⅈ
0.333333333333333 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: unicode_art(SR(CDF(1/3 + I)))  # should use symbol ⅈ
0.3333333333333333 + 1.0*I
```

The underlying problem is that these complex numbers cannot be converted to Sympy, currently, which is what the `unicode_art` method of symbolic expressions would need. In that case, the fallback is the usual string representation, which does not use the symbol `ⅈ`. Hence, this is solved by implementing the conversions above.

Additionally, this ticket improves the conversion to Sympy of elements of `RealField` by taking into account the `precision` of the field.

```
sage: a = SR(RealField(100)(1/3))
sage: a, unicode_art(a)  # unicode art loses precision
(0.33333333333333333333333333333, 0.333333333333333)
```

Note that other implementations of complex numbers (`QQbar`, `CIF`, `CBF`), that cannot meaningfully by converted to Sympy in general, are not affected by this ticket. For example, the following symbolic expressions still render the same:

```
sage: unicode_art(SR(QQbar(1 + I)))
I + 1
sage: unicode_art(SR(CBF(1/3 + I)))
[0.3333333333333333 +/- 7.04e-17] + 1.000000000000000*I
```
