This will provide a fast almost uniform random generator for triangulations of polygons.

This will extend the functionality of `graphs.RandomTriangulation()` to choosing the degree of the outer face of the triangulation. Currently, only outer faces of degree 3 are provided.

As the current implementation, this will use the algorithm via a bijection with blossoming trees due to Schaeffer and Poulalhon (Optimal Coding and Sampling of Triangulations, Algorithmica 2006, https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00453-006-0114-8.pdf).

This

```
k = (len(pendant_word)+4) / 2
```
should rather use `//`, no ?

I am getting 16 failures when testing with python3-built sage. Maybe all caused by the line above creating a float. 

Please add before the line 

```
from six.moves import range
```
another line containing

```
from __future__ import print_function, division
```
so that the behaviour of division becomes py3-like.
