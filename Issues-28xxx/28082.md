CC:  @kiwifb @frederichan-IMJPRG

In Sage 8.8, giacpy_sage fails to build – apparently, because it is not using the flag `-std=c++11`. So it fails if the compiler doesn't default to C++11.

The logs are attached (OS X 10.13.6). This was originally reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/OCweUCoikXc/Nuazv8TRAgAJ).

Indeed, there is #7028. See also https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585. Apparently, Gentoo includes that patch.

There are discussions about this starting at ticket:12426#comment:114 and ticket:23341#comment:8.

And that's why the sage-on-gentoo package works properly but vanilla sage on the same OS doesn't.

If I am being honest we had this discussion for a while and I thought we had included the distutils patch in sage because it threaten to break the sage library in a few places. May be we have a work around that I forgot about.

The language is decided by the source file, not whether the compiler is invoked as `gcc` or `g++`. So `gcc -std=c++11` should work just fine.

I try to understand what happens. Don't you have similar problems with pplpy?

In giacpy_sage there is a
`language="c++"`
in setup.py but should I also add 
`# distutils: language = c++`
in giacpy_sage.pyx?

About the c++ standard used, we mainly want to use the same as the giac library so why isn't the default behaviour the same? or is there some environment variable missed by giacpy_sage?

Let's try to go back to this. `extra_compile_args` is a standard distutils option and is already used in `giacpy_sage`'s setup.py

```
                   extra_compile_args=conf["CXXFLAGS"],
```
You would be excused to think that this is enough to make sure the compilation follow C++11 standard. However the way the autoconf macro we are using works is to ensure that we have C++11 compliant compiler. I repeat: compiler. Which means that `-std=c++11` is added to `CXX` not `CXXFLAGS`.

Now if what Jeroen says gcc's front end being able to recognise c++ code, adding a line `EXPORT CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -std=c++11"` before `sdh_pip_install` in `spkg-install` for `giacpy_sage` should be enough to fix the issue.

```

So I have add the -std=c++11 in the extra_compil_args in setup.py.
cf: https://gitlab.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/han/giacpy-sage/blob/master/setup.py
(and fixed a doctest)

On fedora 29 it gives with sage 8.9beta4:

```

```
so the -std=c++11 is given to gcc. The built/runtime are OK but they were also OK without -std=c++11 on this system.

Basically we just want to follow the behaviour of what is done to extra_compil_args in  *sage/src/setup.py* It seems to also use -std=c++11 but I also saw some gnu++11.

Yes but not only giac. The first error appearing in the original attachment was around NTL includes because giacpy_sage uses

```
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
```
So giacpy_sage must also follow what does the sage/src/setup.py do for other cython modules. And for c++ ones sage/src/setup.py adds the -std=c++11  to extra_compil_args.

I have tried to add giacpy_sage to sage/src/module_list.py  without any flags and let sage/src/setup.py built giacpy_sage, and the -std=c++11 was indeed added.

I have put on a public branch because I don't know a better solution.

Dima and I have had another look at this. The underlying problem seems to be that Sage sets `CXX` to something like `g++ -std=gnu++11`, but distutils invokes a C compiler which is just `gcc`, so the `-std=gnu++11` flag is not passed in the compile command.

Solving this by setting `extra_compile_args` to `-std=c++11` is correct in the sense that this is also what is done elsewhere in Sage to overcome this problem, for example in `sage/libs/polybori/decl.pxd` and `sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pxd`.
