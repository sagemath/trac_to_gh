In Sage 8.8, giacpy_sage fails to build – apparently, because it is not using the flag `-std=c++11`. So it fails if the compiler doesn't default to C++11.

The logs are attached (OS X 10.13.6). This was originally reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/OCweUCoikXc/Nuazv8TRAgAJ).

This is probably an issue where python doesn't identify the code as C++ properly. Note that the sage-on-gentoo package properly use g++ for the same code.

there may be another bug on track about C++ support in distutils.

Indeed, there is #7028. See also https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585. Apparently, Gentoo includes that patch.

And that's why the sage-on-gentoo package works properly but vanilla sage on the same OS doesn't.

If I am being honest we had this discussion for a while and I thought we had included the distutils patch in sage because it threaten to break the sage library in a few places. May be we have a work around that I forgot about.

The problem is not that `gcc` is used instead of `g++`. The problem is that `-std=c++11` is missing from the compiler flags. That looks like an upstream bug.

The language is decided by the source file, not whether the compiler is invoked as `gcc` or `g++`. So `gcc -std=c++11` should work just fine.

I try to understand what happens. Don't you have similar problems with pplpy?

In giacpy_sage there is a
`language="c++"`
in setup.py but should I also add 
`# distutils: language = c++`
in giacpy_sage.pyx?

About the c++ standard used, we mainly want to use the same as the giac library so why isn't the default behaviour the same? or is there some environment variable missed by giacpy_sage?

`gcc` and `g++` are just front-ends to multiple different programs, including different compilers (for c and c++ among others), linkers, and others.  There are differences between whether you invoke `gcc` or `g++` though.  Namely, in the case of `g++`, it *always* assumes you are working on a C++ project (whether you're compiling `.c` sources or `.cpp` sources), so even for apparently "plain C" files it will link in the C++ stdlib since it's assumed to be part of a C++ project.

Let's try to go back to this. `extra_compile_args` is a standard distutils option and is already used in `giacpy_sage`'s setup.py

```
                   extra_compile_args=conf["CXXFLAGS"],

Now if what Jeroen says gcc's front end being able to recognise c++ code, adding a line `EXPORT CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -std=c++11"` before `sdh_pip_install` in `spkg-install` for `giacpy_sage` should be enough to fix the issue.

So I have add the -std=c++11 in the extra_compil_args in setup.py.
cf: https://gitlab.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/han/giacpy-sage/blob/master/setup.py
(and fixed a doctest)

On fedora 29 it gives with sage 8.9beta4:

```
gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wno-unused -fPIC -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/cpython -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/ntl -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cysignals -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/ext -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include/python2.7 -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include/python2.7 -c giacpy_sage.cpp -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/giacpy_sage.o -std=c++11
    In file included from /home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include/giac/poly.h:25,
                     from /home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include/giac/giac.h:5,
                     from giacpy_sage.cpp:665:
    /home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/include/giac/index.h:32: warning: ignoring #pragma anon_unions  [-Wunknown-pragmas]
     #pragma anon_unions

    creating build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7
    g++ -pthread -shared -L/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib -L/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/giacpy_sage.o -L/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib -L/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage/local/lib -lgmp -lgiac -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/giacpy_sage.so -lpari
    running install_lib
```
so the -std=c++11 is given to gcc. The built/runtime are OK but they were also OK without -std=c++11 on this system.

Basically we just want to follow the behaviour of what is done to extra_compil_args in  *sage/src/setup.py* It seems to also use -std=c++11 but I also saw some gnu++11.

 In Sage 8.8, giacpy_sage fails to build – apparently, because it is not using the flag `-std=c++11`. So it fails if the compiler doesn't default to C++11.
 
 The logs are attached (OS X 10.13.6). This was originally reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/OCweUCoikXc/Nuazv8TRAgAJ).

Yes but not only giac. The first error appearing in the original attachment was around NTL includes because giacpy_sage uses

```
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
```
So giacpy_sage must also follow what does the sage/src/setup.py do for other cython modules. And for c++ ones sage/src/setup.py adds the -std=c++11  to extra_compil_args.

I have tried to add giacpy_sage to sage/src/module_list.py  without any flags and let sage/src/setup.py built giacpy_sage, and the -std=c++11 was indeed added.

I have put on a public branch because I don't know a better solution.

Dima and I have had another look at this. The underlying problem seems to be that Sage sets `CXX` to something like `g++ -std=gnu++11`, but distutils invokes a C compiler which is just `gcc`, so the `-std=gnu++11` flag is not passed in the compile command.

Solving this by setting `extra_compile_args` to `-std=c++11` is correct in the sense that this is also what is done elsewhere in Sage to overcome this problem, for example in `sage/libs/polybori/decl.pxd` and `sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pxd`. With the new giacpy_sage version, everything seems to work, so I am setting this to positive.
