Thank you! (sorry for pushing you but since having `threejs` as the default viewer will be one of the major changes for the end user in Sage 9.0, I thought it was important to have an up-to-date documentation). I will have a look at the updated examples tomorrow. 

> Perhaps we can get another update in before the final release.
