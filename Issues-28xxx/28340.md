in the linear_code.py is an bad wording in line 4925

```
- ``r`` -- a codeword of ``self``
```

`codeword` is usally used for valid codewords;
a better phrasing might be `word`
and then `codeword` for the output description

this was a change to adopt to syndrome decoding, so probably this should be revisited too
