<a id='comment:34'>Comment 34:</a>
This doesn't make sense for a class level docstring:

```
Initialize a class for ideals in a Tate series algebra
```
Did you mean `An ideal in a Tate series algebra`?

For the result of the Gr√∂bner basis, perhaps we should cache that where we disregard the algorithm (and keywords) used?

You can remove the `TESTS::` block in `Jpair`. Also, would it make sense to inline that?

Instead of `int i`, I have been told it is better to use `Py_ssize_t i` as this can have a larger range of possible values.

Nitpick:

```diff
-    - ``I`` - an ideal in a Tate series algebra
+    - ``I`` -- an ideal in a Tate series algebra
 
-    - ``prec`` - the related precision at which the initial generators
+    - ``prec`` -- the related precision at which the initial generators
       are truncated
```

Also, the convention that we follow in Sage is that the one-line start of docstrings should end with a period/full-stop.
