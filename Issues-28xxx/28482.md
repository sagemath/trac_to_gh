```
There is an incorrect matching between the representation vectors and the edges coming from a graph:

```
sage: G = Graph([[3, 4], [4, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 3]])
sage: M = Matroid(G)
sage: R = M.regular_matroid()
sage: R.representation_vectors()
{(1, 2): (-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
 (1, 4): (0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0),
 (2, 3): (0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0),
 (3, 4): (0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1),
 (3, 5): (0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1),
 (3, 6): (0, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0),
 (5, 6): (-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)}
```
So there is a mismatch of the circuits:

```
sage: list(M.circuits())
[frozenset({(3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6)}),
 frozenset({(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)})]
sage: list(R.circuits())
[frozenset({(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 6)}),
 frozenset({(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)})]
```

The problem comes from the assumption that the groundset is iterated through in the same order as the `edge_iterator`, so we just need to pass an ordered groundset according the edge iterator.
