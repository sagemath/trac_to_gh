<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
On Debian testing, Python 3-based 8.9.rc1 + the present patch passes `ptestalllong` with no new failure (reference: 8.9.rc0 as reported [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/JufDVoygjw8/zZKRU0dxAAAJ)).

==>`needs_review`.

Fair warning: `sqlite` seems to be very deep in Sage's dependency tree, and upgrading it entails a *lot* of recompilations. One can't do a "quick check" on this one: allow for time...
