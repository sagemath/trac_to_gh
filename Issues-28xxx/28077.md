I am adding an edge twiceÂ¹ to a (non-multiedge) DiGraph. It shows up only once in the edge list, the second label overwrites the first.  
Then I am deleting the edge, and it no longer shows up in the edge list.  
However, when calculating the shortest path the edge is still visited.

```python
## Minimum repro
d = DiGraph(multiedges=False)
d.add_edge(1, 2, 'A')
# d.plot(edge_labels=True, save_pos=True).show()
# print(d.edges())
d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
# print(d.edges())
d.delete_edge(1, 2)
# print(d.edges())
# d.plot(edge_labels=True).show()
d.shortest_path(1, 2) # result: [1,2], expected: []
```
I would expect `add_edge` and `delete_edge` to be idempotent - when an edge already exists, it should not get added again (ignoring labels for now), when an edge doesn't exist, deleting it should do nothing. Instead, I need to write `if not graph.has_edge(e): graph.add_edge(e)`.

I'm using [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 8.6, Release Date: 2019-01-15, with Python 2.7.15 in a Jupyter notebook, on Win7 64bit.

(1: when flow changes in a network, I update the residual graph by putting edges with flow > 0 and removing those with flow <= 0 - regardless whether the edge already exists or not.)

Welcome to Sagemath.

This is a very good catch. Actually, we also have:

```
sage: d = DiGraph(multiedges=False)
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.delete_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.incoming_edges(2)
[]
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.delete_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.incoming_edges(2)
[(1, 2, None)]
```
You should add a doctest to show that the bug is fixed with a link to this ticket (<code>:trac:\`28077\`</code>).

When debugging I recognized another bug:
In the documentation of `shortest_path` in `generic_graph.py` it says that an empty list is returned if there is no path between the two vertices. This is correct for the default algorithm but not for most of the other algorithms you can choose.

Should I open a new ticket for that or do it in this ticket?
