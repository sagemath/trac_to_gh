I am adding an edge twiceÂ¹ to a (non-multiedge) DiGraph. It shows up only once in the edge list, the second label overwrites the first.  
Then I am deleting the edge, and it no longer shows up in the edge list.  
However, when calculating the shortest path the edge is still visited.

```python
## Minimum repro
d = DiGraph(multiedges=False)
d.add_edge(1, 2, 'A')
# d.plot(edge_labels=True, save_pos=True).show()
# print(d.edges())
d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
# print(d.edges())
d.delete_edge(1, 2)
# print(d.edges())
# d.plot(edge_labels=True).show()
d.shortest_path(1, 2) # result: [1,2], expected: []
```
I would expect `add_edge` and `delete_edge` to be idempotent - when an edge already exists, it should not get added again (ignoring labels for now), when an edge doesn't exist, deleting it should do nothing. Instead, I need to write `if not graph.has_edge(e): graph.add_edge(e)`.

I'm using [SageMath](SageMath) version 8.6, Release Date: 2019-01-15, with Python 2.7.15 in a Jupyter notebook, on Win7 64bit.

(1: when flow changes in a network, I update the residual graph by putting edges with flow > 0 and removing those with flow <= 0 - regardless whether the edge already exists or not.)

<a id='comment:10'></a>Welcome to Sagemath.

This is a very good catch. Actually, we also have:

```
sage: d = DiGraph(multiedges=False)
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.delete_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.incoming_edges(2)
[]
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.add_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.delete_edge(1, 2, 'B')
sage: d.incoming_edges(2)
[(1, 2, None)]
```
You should add a doctest to show that the bug is fixed with a link to this ticket (`:trac:`28077``).
