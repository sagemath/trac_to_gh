<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

On the same machine, the following works, but takes long time

```
sage: %time P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(14)
CPU times: user 8.08 s, sys: 76 ms, total: 8.16 s
Wall time: 8.15 s
```

is it normal that it takes soo long?

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Is there a particular reason for testing this? Otherwise I would just mark it as not tested.

This points out that the hypercube is set up the wrong way. It takes much much longer to set it up from vertices than from inequalities:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.hypercube(14)
CPU times: user 2.73 s, sys: 11 ms, total: 2.74 s
Wall time: 2.74 s
sage: %time Q = Polyhedron(ieqs=P.inequalities())
CPU times: user 401 ms, sys: 3.95 ms, total: 405 ms
Wall time: 404 ms
```

With #28880 we could just provide both Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation whenever possible
(for example when dilating). If the backend does not allow setting up from both, then at least the shorter representation will be chosen.

This is a doctest for the `integral_points` method. The point of the doctest is the following line, which took very long before I implemented a simple rounding improvement. It's fine with me to mark the test "long time" or "not tested".

Yes, that would be the best fix for the hypercube.

Setting up the hypercube with Hrep will involve shuffling of vertices.

Is it possible that your run has very little memory available?

I can get the tests to pass even with a memorylimit of 1400 MB. However, there are many obvious ways to reduce the memory usage, especially in this specific test:

- Set up the hypercube with a tuple instead of a list of vertices. (Iterator doesn't work, we need to compare the length of Vrep and Hrep).
- Set up dilation with a tuple of vertices instead of a list of vertices.
- Use backend `field` instead of `ppl` in this specific test (it seems that polyhedra with backend `ppl` are pretty large objects compared to `field`).

With the current branch, `sage -t --long --memlimit=3400 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` return a Bad exit and setting `--memlimit=3500` returns `[1485 tests, 24.67 s] All tests passed!`
    
So it seems testing the file uses somewhere between 3400 and 3500 MB. On my machine, the default --memlimit is 3300 MB which explains the issue.

```
sage -t --help
```
gives:

```
Usage: sage -t [options] filenames

Options:

...

  -m MEMLIMIT, --memlimit=MEMLIMIT
                        maximum virtual memory to allow each test process, in
                        megabytes; no limit if zero or less, but tests tagged
                        "optional - memlimit" are skipped if no limit is set
                        (default: 3300 MB)
```

What is the default memlimit on your machine?

Well, but as we already found out, this is difficult to estimate.

Anyway, it's a good project either way to reduce memory usage. So we could do that.

Have you tried backend `field` instead, as in the branch of this ticket.

```diff
+    sage: P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(14, backend='field')
-    sage: P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(14)
```
should reduce memory usage significantly.

It seems wrong that 

```
sage: quadrangle.combinatorial_automorphism_group().is_isomorphic(groups.permutation.Dihedral(4))
```
should take a lot of memory.

It does not seem sufficient since `sage -t --long --gc=ALWAYS src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` works when this test is marked as `not tested` and return `Bad Exit` if `backend='field'` is used. 

But `sage -t --long --gc=ALWAYS src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` works if I replace the test by
`sage: P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(8, backend='field')` or
`sage: P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(8)`. So reducing from 14 to 8 seems to help more than using `'field'` backend.

I agree but this what I obtain: 

* Using `1/10*polytopes.hypercube(8)` + using `--gc=ALWAYS` + marking the `quadrangle ... is_isomorphic` test as not tested works fine
* Using `1/10*polytopes.hypercube(8)` + using `--gc=ALWAYS` return a Bad exit with the following message:

Maybe what happens at line `8232` with the quadrangle is just the moment where the memory gets busted. But, then, why when I mark the quadrangle line `8232`  as not tested does it suddenly work?

To challenge this hypothesis, I moved the method `combinatorial_automorphism_group` containing the quadrangle test at the very bottom of the file, and this is what I now get:

```

so there is something happening with that particular quadrangle line...

With `P = 1/10*polytopes.hypercube(8)` and separating the quadrangle line into parts, I get that `sage -t --long --gc=ALWAYS src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` works when:

```
            sage: G = quadrangle.combinatorial_automorphism_group()
            sage: D4 = groups.permutation.Dihedral(4) # not tested
            sage: G.is_isomorphic(D4)                 # not tested
```

and fails with bad exit when

```
            sage: G = quadrangle.combinatorial_automorphism_group()
            sage: D4 = groups.permutation.Dihedral(4)
            sage: G.is_isomorphic(D4)                 # not tested
```

What happens with the part `groups.permutation.Dihedral(4)` is a mystery for me. Traceback is below:

```
    D4 = groups.permutation.Dihedral(4)

<div id="comment:35" align="right">comment:35</div>

So long as we're making micro-optimizations, can the inner lists be turned into tuples, too? E.g.

```
- ieqs = tuple([0]*(dim+1) for _ in range(2*dim))
+ ieqs = tuple(itertools.repeat(tuple(itertools.repeat(0,dim+1)),2*dim))
```

```
- cp = tuple(itertools.product([-1,1], repeat=dim))
+ cp = tuple(itertools.product((-1,1), repeat=dim))
```

```
- cp = tuple(itertools.product([0,1], repeat=dim))
+ cp = tuple(itertools.product((0,1), repeat=dim))
```

It looks like we're looping through a lot of structures twice, too. This pattern repeats itself:

```
new_inequalities = tuple(f.vector()*one for f in self.inequality_generator())
for f in new_inequalities:
    f[0] *= scalar
```

The comprehension could be modified to spit out the right thing the first time through, or at the very least we could use `map()` with a lambda to apply the "multiply the first coordinate by <scalar>" function as the tuple is built.

Thanks. I went to generators now.

This has the advantage that `ppl` doesn't waste time creating a tuple, which it won't need later.
Also all we need the input vertices/rays/lines/inequalities/equations to be good for is to be iterable exactly one time. So I would consider it to be a waste creating a tuple for that. Now I'm passing the prefered representation to `__init__`, which will discard the other one if the backend doesn't support precomputed data.

Anyway, I don't know how much this is really worth it.

Yeah, but this still shouldn't be this hard to figure out. How much RAM does your system have and is swap enabled? I'm able to go as low as 1300 on my ancient Phenom II with 6GB of RAM:

```

One difference that I suspect between you and (Jonathan and I) is the optimization flags passed to the compiler while building sage. I think we both use `-march=native` for everything, and you could be getting some SPKG built non-optimally to the point where one of these methods wastes a ton of memory. If you're up for it, you could try

```
$ export CFLAGS="-O2 -march=native" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=native" FCFLAGS="-O2 -march=native"
$ git clean -x -f -d
$ ./bootstrap
$ make build
```

to wipe your sage installation and rebuild everything from scratch with those optimization flags. That may improve your memory usage (and would be another reason to hope for Jonathan's `-march=native` branch to get merged), but it's admittedly a stab in the dark.

There's probably nothing unusual here, but:

should show the relevant stuff on linux. On mac or windows I would have to resort to google.

Nothing unusual.

Another thing I thought of: if recompiling everything with `-march=native -O2` doesn't help... maybe there's some system package being used that was built without optimizations...

```
$ grep 'will use system' config.log
```

should show which which system packages are being used.
