That would be a nice addition!

The branch needs rebasing. In addition I suggest considering these minor changes:

```diff
-        p, q = ZZ(1), ZZ(1)
+        p = q = ZZ.one()
         if all_rationals:
-            yield self(0)
+            yield self.zero()
             while True:
-                yield self(p / q)
-                yield -self(p / q)
+                yield self((p, q))
+                yield self((-p, q))
                 p, q = q, 2 * (p // q) * q - p + q
         else:
             while True:
-                yield self(p / q)
+                yield self((p, q))
                 p, q = q, 2 * (p // q) * q - p + q
```

It's indeed a cute sequence. The generating formula is surprisingly simple, but most problems that require iterating over the rationals are better served by another order (indeed, it's since been replaced by iteration by height):

Thanks @nbruin for pointing out the initial iterator for `QQ`
used this sequence, and for the pointers to the commits
implementing it and then replacing it with a better default.

This ticket aims to provide a Calkin-Wilf iterator as distinct
from the standard iterator for `QQ`.

Would you advise against it? Would this Calkin-Wilf iterator
better be given as an example in the tutorial on iterators?
Maybe with a reference from the documentation of `QQ`?

I'd think so. The formula is exceedingly simple: see the original implementation that was essentially a one-liner.

I was originally enthusiastic when I learned about the formula, but I don't think the sequence really has wider applications. Including it would be more of encyclopedic interest, and I think `QQ` is not the right place for that. We already have OEIS. Interfacing with that makes more sense. There is in fact a (lousy) sage program listed there. It would make a lot more sense if there were an iterator there.
