That would be a nice addition!

The branch needs rebasing. In addition I suggest considering these minor changes:

         if all_rationals:

             while True:
-                yield self(p / q)
-                yield -self(p / q)
+                yield self((p, q))
+                yield self((-p, q))
                 p, q = q, 2 * (p // q) * q - p + q
         else:
             while True:
-                yield self(p / q)
+                yield self((p, q))

Thanks @nbruin for pointing out the initial iterator for `QQ`
used this sequence, and for the pointers to the commits
implementing it and then replacing it with a better default.

This ticket aims to provide a Calkin-Wilf iterator as distinct
from the standard iterator for `QQ`.

Would you advise against it? Would this Calkin-Wilf iterator
better be given as an example in the tutorial on iterators?
Maybe with a reference from the documentation of `QQ`?

The formula is exceedingly simple: see the original implementation that was essentially a one-liner.\n\nI was originally enthusiastic when I learned about the formula, but I don't think the sequence really has wider applications. Including it would be more of encyclopedic interest, and I think `QQ` is not the right place for that. We already have OEIS. Interfacing with that makes more sense. There is in fact a (lousy) sage program listed there. It would make a lot more sense if there were an iterator there.",

I'd think so. The formula is exceedingly simple: see the original implementation that was essentially a one-liner.

I was originally enthusiastic when I learned about the formula, but I don't think the sequence really has wider applications. Including it would be more of encyclopedic interest, and I think `QQ` is not the right place for that. We already have OEIS. Interfacing with that makes more sense. There is in fact a (lousy) sage program listed there. It would make a lot more sense if there were an iterator there.
