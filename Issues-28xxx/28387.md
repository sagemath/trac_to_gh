This ticket adds the balanced_digits function, returning the digit representation of an integer where the digits are centered at 0. For example, this enables:

```
sage: 8.balanced_digits(3)
[-1, 0, 1]
```

```
sage: 33.balanced_digits(6)
[3, -1, 1]
```

That's a good idea to add this. I've a few comments on your implementation though. 

## Incorrect algorithm?

First, it is not clear to me (so the docstring should be adapted) what is the exact specification. I would say that the balanced base `b` uses `b` digits centered around zero. Thus if `b` is odd, there is only one possibility, namely digits between `-b//2` and `b//2` (both included). For instance in base 9, one uses digits from -4 to 4. If `b` is even, one has to choose between digits from `-b//2` to `b//2-1` or `-b//2+1` to `b//2` (base 10 for instance: either -5 to 4 or -4 to 5), and this is defined by the value of `positive_shift`. Is that we you have in mind? Note that in this case, your implementation has a problem:

```python
sage: n = -46
sage: n.balanced_digits(10) # correct
[4, -5]
sage: n.balanced_digits(10, positive_shift=True) # should be [4, 5, -1]
[4, -5]
```

I think that a correct algorithm (if my specification in the one you have in mind) would be easier to write using a "balanced `quo_rem`" that on input `a` and `b` returns `(q, r)` such that `a = b*q + r` with `-b//2 <= r <= b//2` (with the same subtleties for even bases). This could go as follows:

```python
def balanced_quo_rem(self, right, positive_shift=True):
    q, r = self.quo_rem(right)
    if r > right//2:
        return (q+1, r-right)
    if right % 2 == 0 and not positive_shift and r == right//2:
        return (q+1, r-right)
    return (q, r)
```

Then the algorithm could be implemented as (I just put the main idea):

```python
def balanced_digits(self, base, positive_shift=True):
    digits = []
    n = self
    while n > 0:
        q, r = n.balanced_quo_rem(base, positive_shift)
        digits.append(r)
        n = q
    return digits
```


## Other remarks

Below, I indicate a few general comments on your current implementation (and the docstring, tests, etc.), though it should be changed anyway.

#### In the docstring

1. There should not be a blank line as first line;
2. It should be "Return" rather than "Returns" (as mentioned in [the doc](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content));
3. Following the doc also, I would put a blank line between the first sentence ("Return ... given base") and the rest of the specification;
4. I would write "Return **the** list of balanced digits" rather than "Return a list of balanced digit" (since there is uniqueness);
5. You should replace `b/2` by `b//2` in the docstring to indicate a floor division (if the base is odd);
6. Your `::` alone on a line should be replaced by `TESTS::`;
7. You should write a more precise specification more generally.

#### In the code itself

1. I think that having `base = 10` as default would be a good idea, to be consistent with `n.digits()` for instance (should be then mentioned in the doc obviously);
2. You may raise an `Exception` if the base is not an integer (and add an `EXAMPLE` for this). Something like:

   ```python
   if isinstance(base, Integer): 
       _base = base
   else:
       try:
           _base = Integer(base)
       except TypeError:
           raise ValueError('base should be an integer')
   ```
3. You should not use `floor(b/2)`, but rather `b//2`;
4. You may compute `self_abs` and `neg` as follows: `self_abs, neg = self.abs(), self.sign()`

I updated the code and used the documentation you suggested. I tested the runtime on all three algorithms and went with the last one (using the standard n.digits(b) function) as it worked fastest for large bases.

That's fine for me!

A side note: It is usually not needed (nor advised) to merge new versions in a branch. As long as the merge automatically works¹, it is fine. The history is simpler to read if there aren't several merges.

¹ This is showed by the color of the link to the branch in the description: Green is OK, red is NOT OK, orange means NOT TESTED and you just need to click the link for trac to try the merge (and change the color accordingly).
