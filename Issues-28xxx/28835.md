<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Is it worth keeping the Makefile target `buildbot-python3`? 

Perhaps for another ticket: should we add a `buildbot-python2` target, or is maintaining Python 2 compatibility not that important? If we do want to add this, we should add `$(MAKE) sagenb` as one of its rules.
