ok, fixed. Back to needs review

By the way, conversion back from gap matrices seems not to work correctly.

```
sage: P = posets.TamariLattice(3)
sage: libgap(P)
<A poset on 5 points>
sage: A = libgap(QQ).PosetAlgebra(P)
sage: A.CoxeterMatrix().sage()
[[0, 0, 0, -1, -1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]
sage: type(_)
<class 'list'>
```
But this would be for another ticket.
