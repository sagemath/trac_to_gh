Thank you to everyone for #27865!

However, I think there are unintended consequences when it comes to certain types of overlapping options.  Can we set the options individually?

```
P1 = plot(prime_pi,3,30,color='black',legend_label='1')
#P1 += plot(Li,3,30, color='green',legend_label='Li1')
P2 = plot(prime_pi,40,70,color='blue',legend_label='2')
#P2 += plot(Li,40,70, color='red',legend_label='Li2')
graphics_array([P1,P2])
```

This doubles the labels in the second graphic.  If you uncomment the other lines more things happen, though it might all be just one bug.  Trying `graphics_array([P1,P2,P2])` only doubles the last one. 

I *believe* this is new since the new graphics array stuff, though I can't be sure. Thanks for looking into it!
