With SageMath 8.8, released 2019-06-26, the command

```
sage -t --long --optional=sage,internet src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```

gives

```
sage -t --long src/sage/databases/oeis.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/databases/oeis.py", line 928, in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.natural_object
Failed example:
    av = oeis('A087778') ; av             # optional -- internet
Expected:
    A087778: Decimal expansion of Avogadro's ...
Got:
    A087778: Decimal expansion of experimental Avogadro's constant (in mol^(-1)).
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  22 in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.natural_object
    5 webbrowser tests not run
    0 tests not run because we ran out of time
    [266 tests, 1 failure, 56.93 s]
```

We modify the doctest to accommodate this variation in the sequence's description at OEIS.
