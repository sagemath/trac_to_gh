LGTM except you have a doctest failure in `src/sage/categories/groups.py`. So it seems like some order changed in a subtle way. It probably just is a doctest that we need to update.

Before

```
sage: sorted(SL(2,2))
[
[0 1]  [0 1]  [1 0]  [1 0]  [1 1]  [1 1]
[1 0], [1 1], [0 1], [1 1], [0 1], [1 0]
]
```
After

```
sage: sorted(SL(2,2))
[
[1 0]  [1 0]  [0 1]  [0 1]  [1 1]  [1 1]
[0 1], [1 1], [1 0], [1 1], [1 0], [0 1]
]
```
So indeed there is a change here.
