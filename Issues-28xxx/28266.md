The current implementation works by constructing a graph and using the connected components of that. Not only does this create (complicated) transient objects, it is all done in Python. This provides a direct implementation in Cython.

I tried multiplying a few elements in the wild (not single diagrams, but linear combinations) and I see ~2x speedup in total at n=3.

Thank you for doing the review.

I think the linear combination code starts becoming the time sink. Unfortunately I don't see how to speed that part up. `:/` Yet, it is very good to see that it still is getting a ~2x speed improvement.
