```
As mentioned in #20178, pexpect used to leave zombie processes around upon EOF.

Now that appears to be fixed.  Unfortunately, if the EOF occurs because the process was killed and wait()-ed by a different process, and not by pexpect itself, rather than just ignore the situation and set the process as closed, pexpect (really ptyprocess in this case) *raises an exception* and does not mark the process as terminated.

Therefore any subsequent attempt to restart the GAP process tries again to call `isalive()` and just gets the same exception again.

We should instead catch this exception and just force the process to be marked as terminated.

This is a bit of a mess but it seems to take care of it.

Although #20178 appears to be "fixed" the fix is not so useful, because now any situation where `isalive()` gets called results in unhandled exceptions in the case described in this ticket, where the underling process died unexpectedly.
