The specialization function doesn't support having a FractionField splitting a tower of nested polynomial rings:

```
R.<c> = QQ[]
F = Frac(R)
S.<x> = F[]

(x + c).specialization({c:2})
# returns x + c
```

I think you're off to a good start here. I have a couple issues and a couple questions. Also, my branch simplifies the commit structure a little and adds the ticket number to the message.

in fraction field element:

- specialization needs better documentation (second longer description, doc test, inputs, output)

- add a _sub_specialization example

- line 515: not sure what this is doing. It seems to be saying a dictionary entry in not anywhere in the tower, but when I attempt that no error is raised

```
else:
   raise NameError("argument " + str(var) + " is not a generator anywhere in the polynomial tower")
```
The following example seems like it should fail this test, yet does not. Also the following example is giving incorrect output (u is being treated as c)

```
Rr.<u>=QQ[]
R.<c> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
S.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(FractionField(R))
T.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(FractionField(S))
D = dict({u:1,x:1})
from sage.rings.polynomial.flatten import SpecializationMorphism
f = SpecializationMorphism(T, D)
f._sub_specialization
g=a^2+c*x*y
g.specialization(D)
```

I don't think passing in a value for u should fail, it should just do nothing with it.

- Some more comments in the Fractional Specializaiton Morphism class wouldn't hurt to explain the recursive calling structure

- 659: ("p must be a fractional field element") -> fraction field

- no trailing white space in lines 640, 663

- no blank line 656

So about your example, I will continue working on it, but for future reference it's a case of a particularly nasty looking FlatteningMorphism bug (on master):

```
# Rr is completely unrelated to our polynomial tower
Rr.<u> = QQ[]

# Notice: no fractions
R.<c> = ZZ[]
S.<x,y,z> = R[]

from sage.rings.polynomial.flatten import FlatteningMorphism

F = FlatteningMorphism(S)
F(u)
# returns 'c' for some reason! Should give some kind of error
```

The code I wrote didn't anticipate this, so I'll take a closer look later this weekend!

I didn't check master, so this bug was already there :(.

It's actually a pretty bad bug since I was getting examples where the specialization contains values for both u and c and it was choosing the u value to specialize c to even though u was not in the tower at all.

It may be an issue of sage being somewhat too helpful along the lines of coercing R(u) = c. If you use Rr.<u,v>=QQ[] then u is not treated as c in these examples. So it may be that somewhere in the code you need to explicitly map the variables instead of coercing.

The new commits do catch the unused variables. Although I think it should work like .subs({D}) does in that it ignores anything passed in that is not in the tower (rather than raise an error).

I'm not sure we want to 'fix' the Specialization Morphism call. It may seem weird when you first do it, but having the behavior consistent with how the polynomial ring constructors work in general is a good thing. So, whatever coercion sage would do in the ring constructor for the domain/codomain should behave the same way as for the morphism call (which it does).

Specialization is a little different as we are substituting in values for variables, and that change of variable names leads to unexpected behavior.
