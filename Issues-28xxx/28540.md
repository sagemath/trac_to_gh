In #28444, bytes_to_str was made more tolerant: It now accepts as input not only bytes but also str. A str input is returned unaltered.

bytes_to_str is also used in sage.structure.factory.lookup_global. It turns out that a pickle created in py3 may not be unpicklable in py2 because the stored name of the global is a unicode, but a bytes or str is expected.

Obvious fix: Try to convert unicode to str in lookup_global.

Depends on #28444

That needs to go into a differently-named routine. You're clearly not converting bytes to str here. You're taking *some* input and trying to ensure it's "str".

There is of course a way to convert a unicode object to py2: `s.encode("utf8")`. Which in Py3 will actually result in a bytes object. That's a pretty clear clue that this behaviour does NOT belong in a routine named `bytes_to_str`.

OK, that somehow makes sense to me. So, I will not touch it.

Question: Is the change that I have introduced in #28444 OK, then? At least it made it possible to read a py2 pickle in py3.
