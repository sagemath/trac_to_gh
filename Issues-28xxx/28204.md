In #28188, the default location of MeatAxe's multiplication tables changed. The old location is hardcoded in `p_group_cohomology`. Proposed change: The `MTXLIB` environment variable should entirely be dealt with in `sage-env`, and `p_group_cohomology` shouldn't mess with it.

In addition, I just noticed that there I was preparing a version 3.2 of the package anyway. Hence, there will be more features, too, namely:
- Detect whether two cohomology rings are isomorphic as graded rings.
- Make it easier to define a cohomology ring from a tower of subgroups
- Provide computation of kernels and preimage representatives of induced homomorphisms.

Apparently without me wanting it, my editor added some indentation to the code. So, after all, I DID change the logger, but without being aware of it.

Why is that? Because of the `>>>` in the line before? But I have `>>>` in other tests, which do not exhibit such error.

Just in time before beginning of the next workshop, I (hopefully) finished the next version of my cohomology spkg.

THe new features are in the ticket description. The test suite during installation passes (although I get warnings about long running tests; my impression is that the harddisk of my laptop is deteriorating).

Because of passing tests, it is "needs review"!

I don't think it is possible to use my package not through Sage.

I guess in the package's setup.py it is possible to change the module name into p_group_cohomology even if the source code directory still is !pGroupCohomology. However, how would I add the deprecation warning for `from pGroupCohomology import ...`?

Again, I wouldn't bother, but you could use `lazy_import`, which has a deprecation parameter that you pass the ticket number.

I think I will change `pGroupCohomology` to `p_group_cohomology` only in the next version of the package, unless a reviewer requests to do it now.
