IMHO its a giant pita that homebrew installs stuff in /usr/local, that is where you put stuff that is supposed to be picked up when you compile third-party stuff. Essentially turning each homebrew system into a distinct snowflake. I don't see how we can support that.

Does it build if you rename /usr/local?

Also, are we always talking about gcc? We don't build gcc by default on OSX anyways. The only really pressing issue is building gfortran, since Xcode doesn't come with a fortran compiler.
