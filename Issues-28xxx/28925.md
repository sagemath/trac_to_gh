This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.

Ordinary packages (directories of modules) can be turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
Then several distribution package can share the same namespace. 

Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.

Per convention in the Sage library, namespace packages are recognized by the presence of `all.py` or `all__*.py` files (#33033).

In this ticket, we apply it to turn **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** (from #29865) into namespace packages, 
in which `__init__.py` are removed from the `MANIFEST.in` files.

Because the actual files are not removed from the source tree, the normal build of the Sage distribution is not affected.

To test these two distributions:

```
./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-objects && SAGE_NUM_THREADS=16 tox -r -v -v -v -e py39)'

./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-categories && SAGE_NUM_THREADS=16 tox -r -v -v -v -e py39)'
```

Follow-up tickets:
- #33011 Remove the `__init__.py` files for packages designated to be namespace packages
- Wishlist item: Warn or give errors if the `sage_setup: distribution` directives, `namespace` and `nonamespace` files indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.
- #30152 will make further changes to the cleaner that will allow out-of-tree namespace packages

+As discussed in #28175 and https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin/pull/4, it may be useful to modularize sage by the use of native namespace packages (PEP 420) - See ​https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/
+
+1. One obstacle to using namespace packages is that `src/setup.py` (`clean_stale_files`) deletes unknown files in the installation tree (`$SAGE_LIB/sage` = `..../site-packages/sage`). This would remove installed namespace packages within the `sage` package.
+
+2. We also need to adjust the mechanism for source discovery. 
+
+   Ordinary packages are turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file. But `find_python_sources` uses `__init__.py` to recognize package directories. 
+
+   a) We either need to list the namespace package explicitly in `setup.py` (`packages=python_packages + find_namespace_packages(include=['sage.x.y.z'])`), ...
+
+   b) or invent something Sage-specific... such as a comment on the top of a module file that indicates into which distutils package a given module belongs...
+
+```
+   # distutils_package: sage_tdlib
+```
+    (This would be parsed by `find_python_sources`, which would also warn or give errors if these comments indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.)
+
+3. For Cython extensions, currently we use a mix of explicitly named modules and wildcards in `src/module_list.py`. This is very different from how we discover Python modules. We should probably create a function similar to `find_python_sources` for this as well.
+
+We test this on one example module: `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib`.

+    `find_python_sources` parses these directives using code adapted from Cython infrastructure (`Cython.Build.Dependencies.DistutilsInfo`).  We use dashes in these distribution names to emphasize that they are names of distutils packages (distributions), NOT Python package identifiers. 
+
+   In this ticket, we extend this to Python modules - to mark them as belonging to a specific distutils package.
+
+   TBD: Warn or give errors if these directives indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.
+
+3. For Cython extensions, as of Sage 9.1, we use a mix of explicitly named modules and wildcards in `src/module_list.py`. This is very different from how we discover Python modules. #29701 (Replace use of `module_list` and `OptionalExtension` by extending `find_python_sources`) changes this, so 2. above applies to Cython as well.
+
+We test this new mechanism on two example modules: 
+
+- `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib`. The package `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions` is turned into a namespace package. The module is maintained in the sage source tree.
+
+- `sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend`. The package `sage.numerical.backends` is turned into a namespace package. It serves as an example of a module in a namespace package that is maintained outside of the sage source tree (here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-namespace)

+As discussed in #28175 and https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin/pull/4, it may be useful to modularize sage by the use of native namespace packages (PEP 420) - See ​https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/
+
+1. One obstacle to using namespace packages is that `src/setup.py` (`clean_stale_files`) deletes unknown files in the installation tree (`$SAGE_LIB/sage` = `..../site-packages/sage`). This would remove installed namespace packages within the `sage` package.
+
+   Solution: 
+
+   i) On this ticket, sage-the-distribution continues to use the sagelib package (as the monolithic install including the optional extensions via #29701). The cleaner is only modified so it does not forget to collect namespace packages. No other distribution writes into the same tree.
+
+   ii) Follow-up tickets will set up PyPI deployment, using a mildly modularized version of `sagelib` called `sage-core`, and separate packages for each optional extension.  None of these packages will use the sage cleaner; they are installed using pip. 
+
+   iii) After that, in a next step, #30152 will make further changes to the cleaner that will allow out-of-tree namespace packages together with the monolithic sagelib installation.
+
+2. We also need to adjust the mechanism for source discovery. 
+
+   Ordinary packages are turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file. But `find_python_sources` uses `__init__.py` to recognize package directories. 
+
+   a) Instead of using `find_namespace_packages` from `setuptools`, we modify `sage_setup.find.find_python_sources` to also find modules in namespace packages.
+
+   b) We have a few directories that contain Python files but should not be namespace packages. We mark them with a file `nonamespace` (I just made this up, in analogy to the `nodoctest` file).
+
+   c) #29701 already introduced a directive on the top of Cython extension source files:
+
+```
+   # sage_setup: distribution = sage-tdlib
+```
+    `find_python_sources` parses these directives using code adapted from Cython infrastructure (`Cython.Build.Dependencies.DistutilsInfo`).  We use dashes in these distribution names to emphasize that they are names of distutils packages (distributions), NOT Python package identifiers. 
+
+   In this ticket, we extend this to Python modules - to mark them as belonging to a specific distutils package.
+
+   Wishlist item: Warn or give errors if these directives indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.
+
+3. For Cython extensions, as of Sage 9.1, we use a mix of explicitly named modules and wildcards in `src/module_list.py`. This is very different from how we discover Python modules. #29701 (Replace use of `module_list` and `OptionalExtension` by extending `find_python_sources`) changes this, so 2. above applies to Cython as well.
+
+We test this new mechanism on 6 example packages (by replacing the `__init__.py` file by a `namespace` file): 
+- `sage.matrix` (for `.matrix_gfpn_dense` -> `sage-meataxe` - #30151).
+- `sage.libs` (for `.meataxe` - #30151, `.sirocco`, `.coexter3`, `.fes`)
+- `sage.interfaces` (for `.primecount`)
+- `sage.graphs` (for `.bliss`, `.mcqd`)
+- `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions` (for `.tdlib` -> `sage-tdlib`, #29864.)
+- `sage.numerical.backends`. (This is preparation for later work, in #30152.)
+
+See also:
+- #29705: Meta-ticket: Modularize sagelib into separate distutils packages
+- #21654: `src/setup.py`: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory

Description changed:

+++ 
@@ -1,3 +1,43 @@
+This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.
+
+Ordinary packages (directories of modules) are turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
+
+Then a different distribution (distutils package) can share the same namespace. 
+
+In the first stage of modularization, planned for Sage 9.3, we use this new mechanism to split out all "optional extension modules" (which depend on some optional library) from the `sagelib` distribution to separate pip-installable packages. This will simplify deployment and dependency management.
+
+(The source code remains in the same place in `src/sage` in the git tree; the new pip-installable packages will have separate metadata in `build/pkgs/SPKG`.)
+
+1. To this end, this ticket changes the following packages to namespace packages (by removing `__init__.py`): 
+- `sage.matrix` (this allows the new distribution `sage-meataxe` introduced in #30151 to add the module `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense`) to the package)
+- `sage.libs` (for `.meataxe` - #30151, `.sirocco`, `.coexter3`, `.fes`)
+- `sage.interfaces` (for `.primecount`)
+- `sage.graphs` (for `.bliss`, `.mcqd`)
+- `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions` (for `.tdlib` -> `sage-tdlib`, #29864.)
+- `sage.numerical.backends`. (This is preparation for later work, in #30152.)
+
+2. Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.
+
+To simplify the implementation and to allow for self-documentation of the directory structure, we introduce `sage_setup`-specific files named 
+- `namespace` to mark a directory without `__init__.py` as a namespace package; 
+- `nonamespace` to mark a directory as a data directory. (This is in analogy with the `nodoctest` files that control the Sage doctester.)
+
+(In the branch of this ticket, these are empty files; but they could contain comments that explain the purpose of a particular directory.)
+
+3. Also the incremental installation mechanisms of sagelib's build system need adjustment. `clean_stale_files`, which deletes installed Python modules in `$SAGE_LIB/sage` = `..../site-packages/sage` that are no longer present in the current version of the source tree, is changed so that it does not delete modules in a namespace package that are provided by a separate distribution (pip-installable package).
+
+
+
+Follow-up tickets:
+- Wishlist item: Warn or give errors if the `sage_setup: distribution` directives, `namespace` and `nonamespace` files indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.
+- #30152 will make further changes to the cleaner that will allow out-of-tree namespace packages
+
+See also:
+- #29705: Meta-ticket: Modularize sagelib into separate distutils packages
+- Initial discussion of namespace packages for Sage in #28175 and https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin/pull/4
+- #21654: `src/setup.py`: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory

+This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.
+
+Ordinary packages (directories of modules) are turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
+
+Then a different distribution (distutils package) can share the same namespace. 
+
+In the first stage of modularization, planned for Sage 9.3, we use this new mechanism to split out all "optional extension modules" (which depend on some optional library) from the `sagelib` distribution to separate pip-installable packages. This will simplify deployment and dependency management.
+
+(The source code remains in the same place in `src/sage` in the git tree; the new pip-installable packages will have separate metadata in `build/pkgs/SPKG`.)
+
+1. To this end, this ticket changes the following packages to namespace packages (by removing `__init__.py`): 
+   - `sage.matrix` (this allows the new distribution `sage-meataxe` introduced in #30151 to add the module `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense`) to the package)
+   - `sage.libs` (for `.meataxe` - #30151, `.sirocco`, `.coexter3`, `.fes`)
+   - `sage.interfaces` (for `.primecount`)
+   - `sage.graphs` (for `.bliss`, `.mcqd`)
+   - `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions` (for `.tdlib` -> `sage-tdlib`, #29864.)
+   - `sage.numerical.backends`. (This is preparation for later work, in #30152.)
+
+2. Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.
+
+   To simplify the implementation and to allow for self-documentation of the directory structure, we introduce `sage_setup`-specific files named:
+    - `namespace` to mark a directory without `__init__.py` as a namespace package; 
+    - `nonamespace` to mark a directory as a data directory. (This is in analogy with the `nodoctest` files that control the Sage doctester.)
+
+   (In the branch of this ticket, these are empty files; but they could contain comments that explain the purpose of a particular directory.)
+
+3. Also the incremental installation mechanisms of sagelib's build system need adjustment. `clean_stale_files`, which deletes installed Python modules in `$SAGE_LIB/sage` = `..../site-packages/sage` that are no longer present in the current version of the source tree, is changed so that it does not delete modules in a namespace package that are provided by a separate distribution (pip-installable package).
+
+
+
+Follow-up tickets:
+- Wishlist item: Warn or give errors if the `sage_setup: distribution` directives, `namespace` and `nonamespace` files indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.
+- #30152 will make further changes to the cleaner that will allow out-of-tree namespace packages
+
+See also:
+- #29705: Meta-ticket: Modularize sagelib into separate distutils packages
+- Initial discussion of namespace packages for Sage in #28175 and https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin/pull/4

+This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.
+
+Ordinary packages (directories of modules) can be turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
+Then a different distribution package can share the same namespace. 
+
+Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.
+
+To simplify the implementation and to allow for self-documentation of the directory structure, we introduce `sage_setup`-specific files named:
+- `namespace` to mark a directory without `__init__.py` as a namespace package; 
+- `nonamespace` to mark a directory as a data directory. (This is in analogy with the `nodoctest` files that control the Sage doctester.)
+(In the branch of this ticket, these are empty files; but they could contain comments that explain the purpose of a particular directory.)
+
+In this ticket, we apply it to turn **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** (from #29865) into namespace packages.

+Follow-up tickets:

+This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.
+
+Ordinary packages (directories of modules) can be turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
+Then several distribution package can share the same namespace. 
+
+Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.
+
+Per convention in the Sage library, namespace packages are recognized by the presence of `all.py` or `all__*.py` files (#33033).
+
+In this ticket, we apply it to turn **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** (from #29865) into namespace packages, 
+in which `__init__.py` are removed from the `MANIFEST.in` files.
+
+
+Follow-up tickets:

+- Wishlist item: Warn or give errors if the `sage_setup: distribution` directives, `namespace` and `nonamespace` files indicate an inconsistent structure such as when it was forgotten to remove `__init__.py`.

+This ticket prepares the modularization of sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages) by adding support for [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) (PEP 420) to sagelib's build system.
+
+Ordinary packages (directories of modules) can be turned into namespace packages by removing the empty `__init__.py` file.
+Then several distribution package can share the same namespace. 
+
+Because our source discovery mechanism in sagelib's build system (`setup.py` + `sage_setup`) distinguishes package directories from other directories containing data files by the presence of the `__init__.py` file, the present ticket makes several adjustments to the build system - in particular to the functions `find_python_sources` and `find_extra_files`.
+
+Per convention in the Sage library, namespace packages are recognized by the presence of `all.py` or `all__*.py` files (#33033).
+
+In this ticket, we apply it to turn **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** (from #29865) into namespace packages, 
+in which `__init__.py` are removed from the `MANIFEST.in` files.
+
+To test these two distributions:
+
+```
+./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-objects && SAGE_NUM_THREADS=16 tox -r -v -v -v -e py39)'

Probably I'm missing something here. The new mechanism seems to still rely on indicator/marker files, just that the are now named `all__`. Except for the different name this seems to be exactly the approach of the rejected PEP 382.
The point of my proposal was that only the setup file should know/decide on which packages it want to include and exclude. Then the general helper in #33033 would like

```
is_namespace_package(dir):
   return dir in setuptools.find_namespace_packages(include=..., exclude=...)
```
And the setup.cfg would use https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html.

The helper function is added in #33033 for runtime use (doctesting). Doctesting needs to be able to work on (a) Sage source trees, (b) installed Sage packages (this is important, for example, for the downstream packagers), (c) arbitrary files. 
Hardcoding inclusions and exclusions in the helper function seems a bit unmodular

Currently, this ticket (and the related ones) go in the direction of the second approach by using `all.py`. For me, using inversion of control and following the first approach seems more natural and flexible. Since you have a better overview though, I trust your judgement.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Thank you for the update.

I have been testing (using) this ticket and and the sequel #33011 for a while. They works well. I checked the code as far as I can (not very far), and it looks good to me. 

If we don't have further comments on this ticket, then it would better be tested by more developers in the wild by merging this now, so that we can fix problems before the next release.

I will wait for your (not Matthias) meta comments, and proceed to "positive review" in a couple of days.

I did `make distclean; make -j8; ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-categories && tox -v -v -v)'`. So this is clean.

This is the initial part that goes wrong:

<a id='comment:1'></a>I start from `git clean -fdx` - which cleans much more.

You'll probably want to move `upstream/` outside and after `git clean` make a symbolic link to it, otherwise it will re-download things.

So it's positive review from me.

Thanks. But it didn't help. As far as I understand, the doctest failures are expected. The real problem is:

```python
$ pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/bin/python3.9 
Python 3.9.13 (main, May 24 2022, 21:28:31) 
[Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sage.categories.category import Category
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/Users/kwankyu/GitHub/sage-dev/pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/categories/category.py", line 107, in <module>
    from sage.misc.c3_controlled import _cmp_key, _cmp_key_named, C3_sorted_merge
  File "sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx", line 364, in init sage.misc.c3_controlled (build/cythonized/sage/misc/c3_controlled.c:11819)
  File "/Users/kwankyu/GitHub/sage-dev/pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/structure/__init__.py", line 2, in <module>
    import sage.structure.element
  File "sage/structure/element.pyx", line 1, in init sage.structure.element (build/cythonized/sage/structure/element.c:36204)
  File "sage/structure/category_object.pyx", line 60, in init sage.structure.category_object (build/cythonized/sage/structure/category_object.c:9982)
ImportError: cannot import name Category
```
Strangely this works 

```python
Hera:sage-dev$ pkgs/sagemath-categories/.tox/py39/bin/python3.9 
Python 3.9.13 (main, May 24 2022, 21:28:31)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sage.structure.sage_object import SageObject
>>> from sage.categories.category import Category
>>> 
```

Anyway, this is not a problem of this ticket. The situation is the same without this ticket.

Hence my positive review to this ticket!

Yes. But even after removing it from the path, it's the same.

sagemath-categories (in contrast to sagemath-standard) does not need `make build` because all of its build and runtime dependencies can be found on PyPI.

**sagemath-categories** as of this ticket does not contain src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py (see `pkgs/sagemath-categories/MANIFEST.in`), so `MatrixSpace` is not available in `sage.all__sagemath_categories`.

Note that the `tox` run ends with the message "lots of doctest failures are expected". This is one of them.

The Sage library contains many cyclic imports. If one starts at the wrong place in an import cycle, one can run into problems with partially initialized modules. See #33580 (Meta-ticket: make all modules importable without sage.all)
