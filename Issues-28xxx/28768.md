Googling, and the only reference I can find to `-l4` would be if you passed the flag `-l4` to `make`, in which case if you got something like this it would be some kind of flag confusion.  I can't imagine otherwise what this would mean.

Erik, I guess you found it. I have in my environment:

```
export MAKEFLAGS="-j4 -l4"
```
which means to use 4 threads for `make`, but with a global limit of 4 for the cpu load.
I guess the `MAKEFLAGS` variable is used somewhere in the Sage and/or OpenBLAS makefile,
and not properly protected.

Thank you for the report.

There was already a relevant ticket and fix upstream:

- https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2616
- https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2617

The fix is part of OpenBLAS 0.3.10 released last week.

Paul confirmed to me he could no longer observe
the problem with OpenBLAS 0.3.10.

Upgrading to OpenBLAS 0.3.10 is now tracked at #29913.
