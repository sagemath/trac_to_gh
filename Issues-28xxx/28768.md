this looks very obscure.

How about using Sage 9.0 or even 9.1betas with openblas from the system?

Erik, I guess you found it. I have in my environment:

```
export MAKEFLAGS="-j4 -l4"
```
which means to use 4 threads for `make`, but with a global limit of 4 for the cpu load.
I guess the `MAKEFLAGS` variable is used somewhere in the Sage and/or OpenBLAS makefile,
and not properly protected.

I did extract the OpenBLAS-0.3.6 tarball shipped with Sage 8.9, did "make" in upstream/OpenBLAS-0.3.6, and the same issues appears:

```

Thus I believe the issue is due to upstream.

Thank you for the report.

I think we didn't test MAKEFLAGS="-j4 -l4" case.

comment:9 says that a report has already been made - surely, if a github issue is to be filed, it would be useful to mention this.

With all respect, setting a gihub account takes a couple of minutes, what's the point of contacting them via an intermediary?  Is it forbidden in INRIA?

There was already a relevant ticket and fix upstream:

- https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2616
- https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2617

The fix is part of OpenBLAS 0.3.10 released last week.

Paul confirmed to me he could no longer observe
the problem with OpenBLAS 0.3.10.

Upgrading to OpenBLAS 0.3.10 is now tracked at #29913.
