in `src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/orthogonal.py` one sees

```
        if invariant_form is not None:
            if is_FiniteField(ring):
                raise NotImplementedError("invariant_form for finite groups is fixed by GAP")
```
but it is not triggered on every finite field input, but only these with `e=0`.
