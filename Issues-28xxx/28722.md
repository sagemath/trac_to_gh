<a id='comment:27'></a>this is missing underscore after reference

```

```
same here:

```
+    Return the constant Omega' appearing in [AKMRVW].
```
and same here

```
+        The constant ``c13``  in Section 5, [AKMRVW]
```

Please check elsewhere.

The following should have a double ::

```
+    EXAMPLES:
+
+        sage: from sage.rings.number_field.S_unit_solver import mus, Omega_prime
```

This could be `if not npi:`

```
+    if len(npi) == 0:
```


You suppressed empty lines between functions. Please put them back. Outside a class, functions must be separated by 2 empty lines. Inside classes, by just one empty line. This is pep8 official recommandation, that we want to follow.

The typo is still there

```
-    # We build a second dictionary of dictionaries.
+    # We build a second dictionary of dictiories.
```

Another typo here:

```
+        #We narrow down the list unitl only one value rmains
```

Note that pep8 also suggest that comments should look like
`  # this is a comment`
rather than
`#this is a comment`

One spurious dot here:

```
+    See [Sma1998]_., [AKMRVW]_.
```

Some "Return" first lines are missing a final dot.

Instead of "var", I suggest to use "polygen" to avoid using any symbolic stuff.
