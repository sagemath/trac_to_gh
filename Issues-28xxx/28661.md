```
150:                         " grep --line-buffered -i 'ipython notebook is running at' |"
151:                         " grep --line-buffered -o http://.*",
```

This code waits for the message `ipython notebook is running at` and expects the token to be on the **same** line.

However, the log file (`~/Library/Logs/sage.log`) no longer conforms to this. The message has changed and the token is on the next line. Example from version 8.9:

```
[I 20:31:00.976 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 20:31:00.976 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=cc2c728ae01f2c3851df1a413a9661f17ca3301b15a9f6e8
```

The consequence of this mismatch is a very long wait when launching Sage notebook using the bundled app.

I believe we can use

```
grep -i --context 1 'jupyter notebook is running at' | grep -o http://.*
```
to obtain the token instead.
