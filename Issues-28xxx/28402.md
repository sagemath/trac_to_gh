As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47587/inverse-of-real-sparse-matrix/), we have:

```
sage: B=matrix(RR, [[1/6, -1/24, -1/30, 1/120,1/12, 0, 0, 0, 0], [-1/24,1/60,1/60, 1/420, -1/24, 0, 0, 0, 0], [-1/30,1/60, 2/105, 1/140, -1/20, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1/120, 1/420, 1/140, 13/1260, -1/40, 0, 0, 0, 0
....: ], [1/12, -1/24, -1/20, -1/40, 1/3, -1/24, -1/30, 1/120,1/12], [0, 0, 0, 0, -1/24,1/60,1/60, 1/420, -1/24], [0, 0, 0, 0, -1/30,1/60, 2/105, 1/140, -1/20], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1/120, 1/420, 1/140, 13/1260, -
....: 1/40], [0, 0, 0, 0,1/12, -1/24, -1/20, -1/40, 1/6]],sparse=true)
sage: (B.inverse()*B).norm(1)
138.4999999999923
```

Note that reverting #24122, by removing the call to `build_inverse_from_augmented_sparse` in the `__invert__` method of `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` (line 5410), leads to a correct answer.

Debian testing running on core i7 + 16 GB RAM here.

On another machine, slightly smalle (Debian testing, core i5 + 8 GB RAM):

```
sage: (B.inverse()*B).norm(1)
1.0000000000019988
sage: B.det()
-0.000000000000000
```

**EDIT :**

```
sage: P=sage.misc.package.list_packages('optional')
sage: P.update(sage.misc.package.list_packages('experimental'))
sage: [P.get(u).get('name') for u in P.keys() if P.get(u).get('installed')]
['fricas', 'dot2tex', 'giacpy_sage', 'python2']

```

> I am able to reproduce it on `8.9.beta8` (previously on beta7):


I'll upgrade to beta8 and report results.

I also cannot replicate the issue with Python 3, whereas I can using Python 2, on those same machines. Any idea what could be causing this?
