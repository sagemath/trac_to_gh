Docker images for python3-based Sage are useful in general,
and in particular for continuous integration or other testing
workflows for packages that depend on Sage.

The infrastructure introduced by #24655 automatically produces
Docker images for python2-based Sage. In order to extend it to
also produce python3-based ones,

- we update the `micro_release` target for `make` in `Makefile`
  to not remove the `config` directory

- we adapt `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `docker/Dockerfile`,
  duplicating all the docker targets for py3, creating
  a `WITH_PYTHON` and a `DOCKER_TAG_SUFFIX`
  environment variables, and using them in the shell
  scripts `docker/*.sh`.

To play with the generated Python 2/3 docker images, you can go to https://gitlab-hooks-flau3jeaza-ew.a.run.app/status/trac/branch/u%2Fsaraedum%2F28041

I'm trying to get this working, but the build is stalling out at:

```
Step 61/80 : RUN sudo $SAGE_ROOT/sage --nodotsage -c "install_scripts('/usr/bin')"
 ---> Running in d4ce02ca02d6
Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.
Cleaning up, do not interrupt this.
Done cleaning.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sage/sage/src/bin/sage-eval", line 4, in <module>
    from sage.all import *
ImportError: No module named sage.all
The command '/bin/sh -c sudo $SAGE_ROOT/sage --nodotsage -c "install_scripts('/usr/bin')"' returned a non-zero code: 1
```

The problem is that `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION` is not being set properly when running `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`.

This is because there are *two* copies of `sage-env-config`, where `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION` is defined:  One under `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` and one other `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`.  This is normal when doing Sage development, and I believe, if it exists, it's the one under `src/bin` that will be used by default when developing/building.

The problem in this case is that although the one in `local/bin` correctly has `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=3`, the one in `src/bin` still has `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=2` for some reason.

I wonder if this is a remnant from an earlier build stage that was cached, but not properly updated for some reason (I thought that different `--build-arg` flags would avoid use incompatible cached images built with different `--build-arg`s, but it's possible that that arg isn't being included in the build early enough.

The problem seems to start here:

```
Step 56/80 : RUN make micro_release
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 2fc1a353e2ac
```

When running `make micro_release`, `./configure` gets re-run, but without any flags we passed it previously.  So it doesn't preserve our `--with-python=3` from earlier.

Replying to [saraedum](#comment%3A11):

No, this is just a pseudo-target in Sage's top-level Makefile.  I have no idea why specifically it's named that.  It's also used by the `fast-rebuild-clean` target.  It just calls `clean` (which is in `build/make/Makefile` for some reason), and then `misc-clean`.

All `clean` does apparently is:

```
clean:
    @echo "Deleting package build directories..."
    rm -rf "$(SAGE_LOCAL)/var/tmp/sage/build"
```

which is certainly worth doing.  But maybe this needs to be detangled a bit...

I think that once your Dockerfile goes through, you just need to add your branch to `build-from-clean`, pull your image from the [GitLab](GitLab) registry and push it to Docker Hub.

For Odile's use I went ahead and pushed a prototype of this up to Dockerhub: sagemath/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha

Unfortunately it still has a bug.  The `sage-entrypoint` still tries to run `make build` (understandably) which results in re-configuring (needlessly) and breaking things.

A workaround for now is to set the PREREQ_OPTIONS variable which is used by Sage's top-level Makefile when it runs configure.  So you can set this when running the container like:

```
docker run -ti --rm -e PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3' sagemath/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
```

Next up, I think we should modify the Docker build to at least keep config.status so that this doesn't keep happening.

Apparently I was not able to successfully upload the Docker image to hub.docker.com because (AFAICT) of [this issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33558#issuecomment-510479853).

But I was able to upload it to our image registry on gitlab.com.   So try:

```
docker run -ti --rm -e PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3' registry.gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
```

You can also use this image as a base for another Docker image by doing something like:

```
FROM registry.gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
ENV PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3'
...
```

That is, you would ensure `PREREQ_OPTIONS` is set as an environment variable in the new image, by default.

This is not ideal and should be fixed, but it's a start anyways...

Without out the `.` it would be a build job. As a default as port of the `test` stage I believe.

Does `sage -i` run `configure` when `config.status` is present?

I don't think making `--with-python=3` persistent is within the scope of this ticket. But it's certainly a problem that we should be aware of.
