It is possible that the field defined by the coefficients is strictly contained in base field of the morphism. This can be happen in a number of situations, especially from conjugations or computing normal forms. There should be a general function to reduce to the field of definition of the coefficients.

This just implements the function and does not have any of the 'client' functions utilize this; like conjugate or normal form. I'm not sure those additional modifications should be part of this ticket.
