sage: m = matrix(GF(2), [[1,0],[0,1]])

TypeError: str() got an unexpected keyword argument 'unicode'
```

This ticket adjusts the signature of `Matrix_mod2_dense.str` to be the same as the one for `Matrix.str`. For complicated arguments, the former redirects to the latter, so now the same is done for `unicode` as well.
