When creating the PolyhedralFan of a Gröbner fan, it is actually created twice. We fix this:

```diff
            f = self.gfan(cmd='topolyhedralfan', I=self._gfan_reduced_groebner_bases())
            self.__polyhedralfan = PolyhedralFan(f)
-           return PolyhedralFan(f)
+           return self.__polyhedralfan
```
