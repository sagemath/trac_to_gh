The doctest on line 811 fails because the two coordinate hyperplanes (the rank-1 elements of the lattice) are swapped. In the doctest, the hyperplane with normal vector [1,0] is written to appear before the hyperplane with normal vector [0,1], while the `._list` attribute, called by `sorted`, lists the hyperplane with normal vector [0,1] before the other. 

So it seems to me like the fix is to fix the doctest, not any bugs in the code.

I agree with just modifying the doctest.

Here is a slightly modified version where we build the Hasse diagram of the intersection poset at the same time as we build the poset to avoid comparisons of the affine subspaces. So this should be faster, but I haven't run any tests.
