Looks good to me. Regarding doctests, I have two comments:

You are writing `sorted(L, key=sorted)` at few places in doctests. I have never seen something like this. Why just `sorted(L)` is not sufficient?

You are writing `. ::` at the end of paragraphs. I think this creates consecutive punctuations `. :` in the html doc. If the `::` appears on its own line, then no `:` are created in place of it in the html doc. Please tell me if I am wrong about this or please inform me so that I improve my knowledge of the Restructured text syntax.

La syntaxe avec `. ::` est correcte, voir

L'utilisation de `sorted(L, ley=sorted)` me semble ok pour un ensemble d'ensembles.

Par contre, le doctest de la ligne 811 ne passe pas chez moi. ==> **Needs Work**
