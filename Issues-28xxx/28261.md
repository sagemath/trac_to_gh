Looks good to me. Regarding doctests, I have two comments:

You are writing `sorted(L, key=sorted)` at few places in doctests. I have never seen something like this. Why just `sorted(L)` is not sufficient?

You are writing `. ::` at the end of paragraphs. I think this creates consecutive punctuations `. :` in the html doc. If the `::` appears on its own line, then no `:` are created in place of it in the html doc. Please tell me if I am wrong about this or please inform me so that I improve my knowledge of the Restructured text syntax.

La syntaxe avec `. ::` est correcte, voir

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#literal-blocks

L'utilisation de `sorted(L, ley=sorted)` me semble ok pour un ensemble d'ensembles.

Par contre, le doctest de la ligne 811 ne passe pas chez moi. ==> **Needs Work**

I agree with just modifying the doctest.

Here is a slightly modified version where we build the Hasse diagram of the intersection poset at the same time as we build the poset to avoid comparisons of the affine subspaces. So this should be faster, but I haven't run any tests.
