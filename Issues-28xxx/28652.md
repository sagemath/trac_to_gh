As part of #28539 we rewrite simplify some of the datastructure of `PermutationGroupElement` and rewrite the constructor to make it much faster.

Here are some performance gain comparing 9.0.beta3 ("OLD") against the code provided in the branch ("NEW")
- Constructor

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 p = S([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 3.94 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 227 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 p = S([(3,1),(7,6,8,2),(9,10,5,4)])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 10.5 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 201 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S('(1,3,5)(2,7)')
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 5.3 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 230 µs per loop
```
  and

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup(['(1,2,3)'])
sage: %timeit -n 10000 P('(1,2,3)')
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 134 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 211 µs per loop
```
  and

```

sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement('(1,2,3)(4,7)')
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 64.2 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 251 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement([1,5,2,3,4])
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 14.9 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 251 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement([(1,5),(2,3,4)])
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 38.5 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 215 µs per loop
```
- iteration of monogen group

```
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6)])
sage: %timeit for p in P: pass
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 5: 2.71 µs per loop
OLD: 1000 loops, best of 5: 252 µs per loop
```
- multiplication of permutation with distinct parents

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(7)
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)])
sage: L1 = list(S)
sage: L2 = list(P)
sage: %%time
....: for s1 in L1:
....:     for s2 in L2:
....:         q = s1 * s2
NEW: Wall time: 11.4 ms
OLD: Wall time: 1.42 s
```

This is still room for improvement for the constructor as it is 10x slower than

```
sage: %timeit -n 10000 Permutation([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
10000 loops, best of 5: 15 µs per loop
```
Though, with `check=False` it is now faster

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4], check=False)
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 4.16 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 59.3 µs per loop
```

Past experiments I've done have shown that `cpdef` is slower.\n\nI am not sure I see the point of having the constructor in a separate file. It also causes us to do two imports in what I would see as the most common scenario, when `parent is None`. Also, in that case, I don't see the point of doing the check again since it was already done in constructing the parent. In other words, I think you should add `check = False` to that case.",

Some little details in the `constructor.py`:

- `{1, ..., n}` -> `\{1, \ldots, n\}` and in latex format (this gets automatically changed when called as `?` doc).
- The error message should start with a lower case (a Python convention).

Should the `_set_*` really be `cpdef` and not just `cdef`? Past experiments I've done have shown that `cpdef` is slower.

I am not sure I see the point of having the constructor in a separate file. It also causes us to do two imports in what I would see as the most common scenario, when `parent is None`. Also, in that case, I don't see the point of doing the check again since it was already done in constructing the parent. In other words, I think you should add `check = False` to that case.

It is always convenient to be able to mutate a permutation without having to reallocate space for a new permutation. Even from Python. This hidden cpdef functions allows me to do the following

```
sage: from itertools import permutations
sage: p = PermutationGroupElement([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p._set_list_images(q, False)
Wall time: 45.1 µs
```
The above is very convenient and infinitely faster than

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p = S(q)
Wall time: 22.6 ms
```

As far as performance are concerned, I don't believe that here `cpdef` vs `cdef` matter in any way. Since `cdef` is just less flexible I would just stick with `cpdef`.

Yes. You should use `my_parent(data)` and not `GenericConstructor(data)`. This is what is done everywhere in `sage.groups.perm_gps` (and also for matrix and co). I am not introducing any new design here.

You are welcome to do so. But it comes as a second step anyway.

That is an abuse of the code IMO (borderlining on a straw-man argument). You really should just be iterating over the corresponding permutation group here. However, I will not be arguing this point (see below).

> As far as performance are concerned, I don't believe that here `cpdef` vs `cdef` matter in any way. Since `cdef` is just less flexible I would just stick with `cpdef`.

I have seen slowdowns when writing things with `cpdef` versus `cdef`. In particular this comes from indirect calls:

```
sage: %%cython
....: cpdef int f_cpdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int f_cdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int indirect_cpdef():
....:     return f_cpdef()
....: cdef int indirect_cdef():
....:     return f_cdef()
....: def test_cpdef():
....:     return indirect_cpdef()
....: def test_cdef():
....:     return indirect_cdef()
....: 
sage: %timeit test_cdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.3 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_cpdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.4 ns per loop
```
Yes, I know ~1% slowdown is not much, but I am consistently getting it and it can stack up. I have seen 10-20% slowdowns in actual code by changing `cdef` to `cpdef`. Although this might not still exist in the current Cython version. I also am not noticing any change in timings for the simple tests I am running. So this isn't anything worth arguing about, but I just wanted to point it out.

Well, I guess you are making an equal swap in the other parts of the library code. Although we do get a bit of a slowdown:

```
sage: %timeit PermutationGroupElement([1,5,3,2,4])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
```
However, this isn't really a big deal.

I also removed some of the to-and-from cycles in constructing permutation group elements. The code is a little more complex, but it does pick up some speed.
Timings that have changed versus your branch:

```
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element import standardize_generator
sage: %timeit standardize_generator([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 3.65 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 22.4 µs per loop
sage: g1 = PermutationGroupElement([(1,2),(3,4,5)])
sage: g2 = PermutationGroup([('a','b')], domain=['a', 'b']).gens()[0]
sage: %timeit g1 * g2
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 37.5 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 38.6 µs per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)])
sage: %timeit for p in P: S(p)
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 µs per loop
```

Let me know what you think.

In the current version we have

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(['a','b','c'])(libgap.eval("(1,2,3)"))
('a','b','c')
```
The above allows (very indirectly) to make the following "works"

```
sage: PermutationGroup(gap_group=libgap.SymmetricGroup(5), domain=[1,3,5,7,9])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3), (1,3,5,7,9)]
```
But to my mind, both shouldn't be allowed at all. There should not be any silent conversion of the domain.

What do you think?

My understanding is that `(lip)gap` only allows for a domain of `{1, ..., n}`. So in my mind this could almost be considered a "feature" of the Sage interface with `(lib)gap`. As such, I am leaning towards actually keeping the current behavior.

It would be nice if we could get rid of all those local imports in the `_set_other`...

I am fine with it but am worried that it is very much against the coercion `SymmetricGroup([1,3,5]) -> SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])`

```
sage: S1 = SymmetricGroup([1,3,5])
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: S2(S1([5,1,3]))
(1,5,3)
```

Two of them which are Cython classes and can actually be cimported. For the rest one can probably hack a `_late_import` but it is not very nice.

I see `SymmetricGroup` as being a different object, and its elements are not `libgap` objects. IMO, you should only be manipulating the libgap objects if you know what you are doing trying to get extra speed out, unless you are working only in libgap.

For the `Permutation`, I think it is okay to have it locally since it is last and already "slow" as it is a Python object. However, do we need to do that for the `pari_gen`?

Actually, since you moved the `standardize_generator`, we probably can do either `lazy_import` or maybe a standard import rather than locally.
