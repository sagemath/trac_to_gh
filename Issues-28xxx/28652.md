As part of #28539 we rewrite simplify some of the datastructure of `PermutationGroupElement` and rewrite the constructor to make it much faster.

Here are some performance gain comparing 9.0.beta3 ("OLD") against the code provided in the branch ("NEW")
- Constructor

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 p = S([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 3.94 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 227 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 p = S([(3,1),(7,6,8,2),(9,10,5,4)])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 10.5 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 201 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S('(1,3,5)(2,7)')
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 5.3 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 230 µs per loop
```
  and

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup(['(1,2,3)'])
sage: %timeit -n 10000 P('(1,2,3)')
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 5: 134 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 5: 211 µs per loop
```
  and

```

sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement('(1,2,3)(4,7)')
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 64.2 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 251 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement([1,5,2,3,4])
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 14.9 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 251 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -n 3000 PermutationGroupElement([(1,5),(2,3,4)])
NEW: 3000 loops, best of 5: 38.5 µs per loop
OLD: 3000 loops, best of 5: 215 µs per loop
```
- iteration of monogen group

```
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6)])
sage: %timeit for p in P: pass
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 5: 2.71 µs per loop
OLD: 1000 loops, best of 5: 252 µs per loop
```
- multiplication of permutation with distinct parents

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(7)
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)])
sage: L1 = list(S)
sage: L2 = list(P)
sage: %%time
....: for s1 in L1:
....:     for s2 in L2:
....:         q = s1 * s2
NEW: Wall time: 11.4 ms
OLD: Wall time: 1.42 s
```

This is still room for improvement for the constructor as it is 10x slower than

```
sage: %timeit -n 10000 Permutation([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
10000 loops, best of 5: 15 µs per loop
```
Though, with `check=False` it is now faster

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: %timeit -n 10000 S([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4], check=False)

Some little details in the `constructor.py`:

- `{1, ..., n}` -> `\{1, \ldots, n\}` and in latex format (this gets automatically changed when called as `?` doc).
- The error message should start with a lower case (a Python convention).

Should the `_set_*` really be `cpdef` and not just `cdef`? Past experiments I've done have shown that `cpdef` is slower.

I am not sure I see the point of having the constructor in a separate file. It also causes us to do two imports in what I would see as the most common scenario, when `parent is None`. Also, in that case, I don't see the point of doing the check again since it was already done in constructing the parent. In other words, I think you should add `check = False` to that case.

But then you can not call it from Python code.

Of course, but do we really want to be able to do that? They seem very internal and are only meant to be called as part of the constructor.

Contrarily to the `PermutationGroupElement` constructor, the `_element_constructor_` of the parent is used by any method of permutation group that has to create elements.


The name can easily be changed. `;)`  Although it sounds like what you are saying is that in library code, we should not use the constructor function. Why not also try and make it fast too? I trying to understand the logic of your design, and I am not saying it is bad/wrong, but I just don't yet comprehend it yet.

It is always convenient to be able to mutate a permutation without having to reallocate space for a new permutation. Even from Python. This hidden cpdef functions allows me to do the following

```
sage: from itertools import permutations
sage: p = PermutationGroupElement([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p._set_list_images(q, False)
Wall time: 45.1 µs
```
The above is very convenient and infinitely faster than

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %time for q in permutations([1,2,3,4,5]): p = S(q)
Wall time: 22.6 ms
```

As far as performance are concerned, I don't believe that here `cpdef` vs `cdef` matter in any way. Since `cdef` is just less flexible I would just stick with `cpdef`.

Yes. You should use `my_parent(data)` and not `GenericConstructor(data)`. This is what is done everywhere in `sage.groups.perm_gps` (and also for matrix and co). I am not introducing any new design here.

You are welcome to do so. But it comes as a second step anyway.

I have seen slowdowns when writing things with `cpdef` versus `cdef`. In particular this comes from indirect calls:

```
sage: %%cython
....: cpdef int f_cpdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int f_cdef():
....:     return 5
....: cdef int indirect_cpdef():
....:     return f_cpdef()
....: cdef int indirect_cdef():
....:     return f_cdef()
....: def test_cpdef():
....:     return indirect_cpdef()
....: def test_cdef():
....:     return indirect_cdef()
....: 
sage: %timeit test_cdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.3 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_cpdef()
100000000 loops, best of 3: 19.4 ns per loop
```
Yes, I know ~1% slowdown is not much, but I am consistently getting it and it can stack up. I have seen 10-20% slowdowns in actual code by changing `cdef` to `cpdef`. Although this might not still exist in the current Cython version. I also am not noticing any change in timings for the simple tests I am running.

Well, I guess you are making an equal swap in the other parts of the library code. Although we do get a bit of a slowdown:

```
sage: %timeit PermutationGroupElement([1,5,3,2,4])
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
```
However, this isn't really a big deal.

> > Why not also try and make it fast too?

> 
> You are welcome to do so. But it comes as a second step anyway.


I also removed some of the to-and-from cycles in constructing permutation group elements. The code is a little more complex, but it does pick up some speed.
Timings that have changed versus your branch:

```
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element import standardize_generator
sage: %timeit standardize_generator([3,1,7,6,8,2,9,10,5,4])
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 3.65 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 22.4 µs per loop
sage: g1 = PermutationGroupElement([(1,2),(3,4,5)])
sage: g2 = PermutationGroup([('a','b')], domain=['a', 'b']).gens()[0]
sage: %timeit g1 * g2
NEW: 10000 loops, best of 3: 37.5 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 38.6 µs per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(10)
sage: P = S.subgroup([(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)])
sage: %timeit for p in P: S(p)
NEW: 100000 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
OLD: 10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 µs per loop
```

Let me know what you think.

<a id='comment:37'></a>
In the current version we have

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(['a','b','c'])(libgap.eval("(1,2,3)"))
('a','b','c')
```
The above allows (very indirectly) to make the following "works"

```
sage: PermutationGroup(gap_group=libgap.SymmetricGroup(5), domain=[1,3,5,7,9])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3), (1,3,5,7,9)]
```
But to my mind, both shouldn't be allowed at all. There should not be any silent conversion of the domain.

What do you think?

My understanding is that `(lip)gap` only allows for a domain of `{1, ..., n}`. So in my mind this could almost be considered a "feature" of the Sage interface with `(lib)gap`. As such, I am leaning towards actually keeping the current behavior.

It would be nice if we could get rid of all those local imports in the `_set_other`...

I am fine with it but am worried that it is very much against the coercion `SymmetricGroup([1,3,5]) -> SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])`

```
sage: S1 = SymmetricGroup([1,3,5])
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroup([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: S2(S1([5,1,3]))
(1,5,3)
```

Two of them which are Cython classes and can actually be cimported. For the rest one can probably hack a `_late_import` but it is not very nice.

I see `SymmetricGroup` as being a different object, and its elements are not `libgap` objects. IMO, you should only be manipulating the libgap objects if you know what you are doing trying to get extra speed out, unless you are working only in libgap.

For the `Permutation`, I think it is okay to have it locally since it is last and already "slow" as it is a Python object. However, do we need to do that for the `pari_gen`?

Actually, since you moved the `standardize_generator`, we probably can do either `lazy_import` or maybe a standard import rather than locally.
