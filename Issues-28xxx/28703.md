When linking the `PyNormaliz_cpp.dll` module, there is a long spew of errors  mostly in two classes that look like:

```

There basically seem to be two broad classes of problems here; one is linking with its library dependencies, either eantic or libnormaliz, or both.  Another seems to be with functions that require OpenMP.

It seems libnormaliz is compiled with `-fopenmp` by default, but since pynormaliz isn't, this breaks.

Depends on #28803
