In order to make `CombinatorialFace` be more consistent with `PolyhedronFace` we make the following changes:

- `face.Hrepr(True)` -> `face.ambient_Hrepresentation()`,
- `face.Hrepr(False)` -> `face.ambient_H_indices()`,
- `face.Vrepr(True)` -> `face.ambient_Vrepresentation()`,
- `face.Vrepr(False)` -> `face.ambient_V_indices()`.

We keep the old methods with deprecation warnings.

The code looks fine. Some remarks on the documentation:
* Make the documentation in `ambient_Hrepresentation` and `ambient_Vrepresentation` consistent:
    In `ambient_Hrepresentation` you have

```
        It consists of the facets/inequalities that contain the face
        and the equalities defining the ambient polyhedron.
```

    In `ambient_Vrepresentation` you have

```
        It consists of the ``[vertices, rays, lines]``
        that face contains.
```

* Make the documentation of `n_ambient_Vrepresentation` consistent with the documentation of `n_ambient_Hrepresentation`:

```diff
---        Return the length of the face.
+++        Returns the length of the :meth:`CombinatorialFace.ambient_V_indices`.

```
