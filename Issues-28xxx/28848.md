This ticket implements the following changes:

- In the class `Set_object`, next to the existing method `subsets`, add the new method `subsets_lattice`. This will return the lattice of subsets, partially ordered by inclusion.

- In the class `Subsets_s` (used to represent the set of subsets of a finite set without repeated elements), add the new method `lattice`. This will also return the lattice obtained by partially ordering the subsets by inclusion.

I think it would be more practical to enhance the Boolean lattice in `poset_examples.py`, i.e., make it accept alternatively a set instead of an integer.

Replying to [@mantepse](#comment%3A1):
> I think it would be more practical to enhance the Boolean lattice in `poset_examples.py`, i.e., make it accept alternatively a set instead of an integer.

Thanks for the suggestion. I had looked into `poset_examples.py` and noticed that no construction in there takes as argument anything more complex than an integer. I was under the impression that for posets constructed from a certain object, it is more common and more convenient to have this construction available as a method of the object.

Anyway, the algorithm I used is largely a copy of `posets.BooleanLattice`. It is more efficient to give the associated subsets immediately, rather than computing a relabelling after having constructed an anonymous Boolean lattice.
