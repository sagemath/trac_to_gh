Background (read
[Python 3 documentation for the `collections` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html)
for more detail):

- [Collections Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html)
  ("CABCs") moved to the `collections.abc` module in Python 3.3.

- These "Collections Abstract Base Classes" are: `AsyncGenerator`,
  `AsyncIterable`, `AsyncIterator`, `Awaitable`, `Bytestring`,
  `Callable`, `Collection`, `Container`, `Coroutine`, `Generator`,
  `Hashable`, `ItemsView`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `KeysView`,
  `Mapping`, `MappingView`, `MutableMapping`, `MutableSequence`,
  `MutableSet`, `Reversible`, `Sequence`, `Set`, `Sized`, `ValuesView`.

- For backwards compatibility, CABCs continue to be visible
  in the `collections` module through Python 3.8; and can be
  imported either from `collections` or from `collections.abc`.

- Starting with Python 3.9, CABCs must be imported from `collections.abc`.

- In Python 2 they could only be imported from 'collections',
  not from 'collections.abc'. So while Sage was keeping
  Py2 and Py3 compatible it made sense to import from `collections`.

- In Python 3.7 and Python 3.8, importing them from `collections`
  gives a deprecation warning. This warning was silenced in Sage,
  see #28002.

In this ticket we import the classes from `collections.abc`.

We do not suppress the silencing of the deprecation warning yet.
See [comment:23](#comment:23) and #30768.

Sorry for letting over a year pass by. Here is a new branch. Please review.

The file `finite_state_machine.py` has `import collections`
and then `collections.defaultdict`, `collections.OrderedDict`,
`collections.deque`, `collections.namedtuple`, `collections.abc.Iterator`.

Would there be an advantage, or a disadvantage, to doing the following instead:

```
from collections import defaultdict, deque, namedtuple, OrderedDict
from collections.abc import Iterator
```
and then using `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`, `Iterator`?

I changed to that style in some other files.

-`Generator`, `Hashable`, `ItemsView`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `KeysView`,
-`Mapping`, `MappingView`, `MutableMapping`, `MutableSequence`,
-`MutableSet`, `Reversible`, `Sequence`, `Set`, `Sized`, `ValuesView`.
+- [Collections Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html)
+  ("CABCs") moved to the `collections.abc` module in Python 3.3.
 
-In Python 3.9 importing them from `collections` will stop working.
-In Python 3.3 to 3.8, they can be imported from `collections` or
-from `collections.abc` (it gives the exact same classes).
-In Python 3.7 and 3.8, importing them from `collections` prints a
-deprecation warning, since Python 3.9 is getting nearer.
+- These "Collections Abstract Base Classes" are: `AsyncGenerator`,
+  `AsyncIterable`, `AsyncIterator`, `Awaitable`, `Bytestring`,
+  `Callable`, `Collection`, `Container`, `Coroutine`, `Generator`,
+  `Hashable`, `ItemsView`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `KeysView`,
+  `Mapping`, `MappingView`, `MutableMapping`, `MutableSequence`,
+  `MutableSet`, `Reversible`, `Sequence`, `Set`, `Sized`, `ValuesView`.
 
-In Python 2 they can only be imported from 'collections',
-not from 'collections.abc'.
+- For backwards compatibility, CABCs continue to be visible
+  in the `collections` module through Python 3.8; and can be
+  imported either from `collections` or from `collections.abc`.
 
-In Sage we have a few such imports:
-`Iterable`, `Iterator`, `MutableMapping`, `Sequence`.
+- Starting with Python 3.9, CABCs must be imported from `collections.abc`.
 
-We deal with this using a try/except block:
+- In Python 2 they could only be imported from 'collections',
+  not from 'collections.abc'. So while Sage was keeping
+  Py2 and Py3 compatible it made sense to import from `collections`.
 
-```
-try:  # works in Python >= 3.3
-    from collections.abc import Sequence
-except ImportError:  # Python 2, Python <= 3.2
-    from collections import Sequence
-```
+- In Python 3.7 and Python 3.8, importing them from `collections`
+  gives a deprecation warning. This warning was silenced in Sage,
+  see #28002.
 
-We can then revert the silencing of warnings from #28002.
+In this ticket we import the classes from `collections.abc`
+and suppress the silencing of the deprecation warning.
