Background (read
[Python 3 documentation for the `collections` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html)
for more detail):

- [Collections Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html)
  ("CABCs") moved to the `collections.abc` module in Python 3.3.

- These "Collections Abstract Base Classes" are: `AsyncGenerator`,
  `AsyncIterable`, `AsyncIterator`, `Awaitable`, `Bytestring`,
  `Callable`, `Collection`, `Container`, `Coroutine`, `Generator`,
  `Hashable`, `ItemsView`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `KeysView`,
  `Mapping`, `MappingView`, `MutableMapping`, `MutableSequence`,
  `MutableSet`, `Reversible`, `Sequence`, `Set`, `Sized`, `ValuesView`.

- For backwards compatibility, CABCs continue to be visible
  in the `collections` module through Python 3.8; and can be
  imported either from `collections` or from `collections.abc`.

- Starting with Python 3.9, CABCs must be imported from `collections.abc`.

- In Python 2 they could only be imported from 'collections',
  not from 'collections.abc'. So while Sage was keeping
  Py2 and Py3 compatible it made sense to import from `collections`.

- In Python 3.7 and Python 3.8, importing them from `collections`
  gives a deprecation warning. This warning was silenced in Sage,
  see #28002.

In this ticket we import the classes from `collections.abc`.

We do not suppress the silencing of the deprecation warning yet.
See comment:23 and #30768.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Sorry for letting over a year pass by. Here is a new branch. Please review.

The file `finite_state_machine.py` has `import collections`
and then `collections.defaultdict`, `collections.OrderedDict`,
`collections.deque`, `collections.namedtuple`, `collections.abc.Iterator`.

Would there be an advantage, or a disadvantage, to doing the following instead:

```
from collections import defaultdict, deque, namedtuple, OrderedDict
from collections.abc import Iterator
```
and then using `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`, `Iterator`?

I changed to that style in some other files.

+for more detail):
+
+- [Collections Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.abc.html)
+  ("CABCs") moved to the \`collections.abc\` module in Python 3.3.
+
+- These "Collections Abstract Base Classes" are: \`AsyncGenerator\`,

+- For backwards compatibility, CABCs continue to be visible
+  in the \`collections\` module through Python 3.8; and can be
+  imported either from \`collections\` or from \`collections.abc\`.
+
+- Starting with Python 3.9, CABCs must be imported from \`collections.abc\`.
+
+- In Python 2 they could only be imported from 'collections',
+  not from 'collections.abc'. So while Sage was keeping
+  Py2 and Py3 compatible it made sense to import from \`collections\`.
+
+- In Python 3.7 and Python 3.8, importing them from \`collections\`
+  gives a deprecation warning. This warning was silenced in Sage,
+  see #28002.
+
+In this ticket we import the classes from \`collections.abc\`.
+
+We do not suppress the silencing of the deprecation warning yet.
