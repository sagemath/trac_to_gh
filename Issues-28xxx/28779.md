Currently "primes_of_bad_reduction" calls, when the base field is not QQ, the function normalize_coordinates. But normalize_coordinates returns an error if the base ring does not have a GCD:

```
R.<X> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
K.<b> = NumberField(X^3 - 11)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
a = 7/(b-1)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([a*y^2 - (a*y-x)^2, y^2])
f.primes_of_bad_reduction() # returns an error
# because it calls the following, which
f.normalize_coordinates() # returns an error (and is meant to!)
```
