Erik, is it safe to remove cleaning from `spkg-install`, or pre-cleaning is not done, so `spkg-legacy-uninstall` won't be invoked by `./sage -f r` ?

I have left `spkg-install` untouched so far.

Uh, yeah, you should just remove the relevant lines from the `spkg-install`.  If there's an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` it *will* be invoked when you run `./sage -f r`.
