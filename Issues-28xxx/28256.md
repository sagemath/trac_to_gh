A polytope is self-dual if its face lattice is isomorphic to the face lattice of its dual polytope.

In this tickets I will add `is_self_dual` method to the `Polyhedron` class to check (combinatorially) if a polytope is self-dual.

Please have in mind that the check should also work for non-fulldimensional polyhedra (e.g. Simplex).

Unfortunately, git.sagemath is down at the moment, so I don't see your code.

It does work for non-full dimensional polytopes. The 3-simplex (a positive example) and the 2nd 4-hypersimplex (a negative example) are already in the doctest.

Yes, most likely both approaches take almost the same time.
I just figured, it's a lot of lines to create a graph that is basically the `vertex_facet_graph`.

Instead of the current approach, I find some prechecking and

```
G1 = self.vertex_facet_graph()
G2 = G1.reverse()
return G1.is_isomorphic(G2)
```
to be more transparent.

It turns out that 'is_isomorphic' does see the directions. So less lines and more readable code.

What do you mean by geometric self duality?

From many ways one could distinguish polyhedra Sage only knows identical and combinatorially equivalent, doesn't it (affinely equivalent and projectively would make sense as well, but I couldn't find this anywhere).

For self duality being exactly self dual doesn't make any sense (once we are at least 2 dimensional). So I would figure the question is a combinatorial one.

In #27689, on the other hand we check of a polyhedron is a prism etc. Here it makes sense to ask for exactly and up to combinatorially equivalence. Maybe one could provide a keyword for cases, where the question has multiple meanings.

Convinced.

Btw, potentially there is also the method `is_combinatorially_dual(self, other)`. Here, specifying 'combinatorially' is even more important. One should name this ticket's method consistently. (Even though checking for self polarity is probably not worth a method.)

A compact polyhedron is always dual to another one using polarity. So this name is incomplete, the self is important there.

Oops, my bad. Didn't see the `other`.

I would still vote for leaving it as `is_self_dual` instead of `is_combinatorially_self_dual`.
I am following the convention that duality is defined for abstract polytopes (face lattices), while polarity is defined for geometric realizations of polytopes (and more generally any subset of an Euclidean space).

For that you can refer to ‎Grünbaum's book (Convex Ptolytopes). In section 3.4, he defined two (geometric realizations of two) polytopes to be *dual* to each other if there is an inclusion-reversing bijection between their face lattices. And later, in the same section, he defined polarity for geometric polytopes by the well know definition.

On the other hand, for `is_self_polar`, since The only set `A` for which `A == A.polar()` is the unit ball (Theorem 3.1 of [1]), the definition should be more loosely than what is suggested. In [1], this is the definition of self-polarity:
A subset `A` of `R^d` is *self-polar* provided there exists some orthogonal transformation `U` of `R^d` such that `A = U*A.polar()`.
This is of course can be done in a different ticket.

I'm totally confused by now and don't know what to think.

I figured we name everything that can be confused with the `combinatorially` prefix.
Now in #27689, JP voted against that.
If find the property self-dual far less ambiguous as being a prism.
The name `is_combinatorially_self_dual` is also hard to find via tab completion.

Overall, I think people with stronger opinions on names than me should decide.
