This ticket fixes an issue in `sage.libs.gmp.pylong.mpz_pythonhash`, the hash function for Integer, and resolves the Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/rings/integer.pyx`.

More precisely, the implementation of `mpz_pythonhash` is using the fact that `y <= modulus`, as explained in the comment

```
        # Safely compute h = (h + y) % modulus knowing that h < modulus
        # and y <= modulus
```
However, this assumption is not always correct, as `y` is the sum of up to three numbers. For example, this fails in

```
sage: hash(2^64 - 1), hash(int(2^64 - 1))
(2305843009213693958, 7)
```

I have not had the chance to test this with Python 3 on a 32-bit machine. Instead, I just computed the 32-bit hashes in the doctests using a modulus of `2^31 - 1`. Could someone with access to a 32-bit machine confirm or correct these, please?

Do we really need the exact values in the docstring? Wouldn't it be sufficient to mark those tests with `# random`? The only thing really that matters is that `hash(n) == hash(int(n))`.

Instead of having separate doctests, I think it is preferable to replace `long(n)` by `int(n)` which should work in both Python 2 and 3.

> I would prefer not to use `long` in doctests, since it is not supported in Python 3. The only reason it works in Sage now is because of a hack that converts `long` to `int` when using Python 3. Maybe instead separate doctests?

Good point. Instead of having separate doctests, I think it is preferable to replace `long(n)` by `int(n)` which should work in both Python 2 and 3. In Python 2, it will still return a `long` if the number is too large.
