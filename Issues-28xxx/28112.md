This ticket fixes an issue in `sage.libs.gmp.pylong.mpz_pythonhash`, the hash function for Integer, and resolves the Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/rings/integer.pyx`.

More precisely, the implementation of `mpz_pythonhash` is using the fact that `y <= modulus`, as explained in the comment

```
        # Safely compute h = (h + y) % modulus knowing that h < modulus
        # and y <= modulus
```
However, this assumption is not always correct, as `y` is the sum of up to three numbers. For example, this fails in

```
sage: hash(2^64 - 1), hash(int(2^64 - 1))
(2305843009213693958, 7)
```

Do we really need the exact values in the docstring? Wouldn't it be sufficient to mark those tests with `# random`? The only thing really that matters is that `hash(n) == hash(int(n))`.

Given that `y` is less than `2 * modulus`, it is more efficient to do

```
if y > modulus:
    y -= modulus
```
(Note that the condition `y > modulus` instead of `y >= modulus` is intentional as it generates better code).

What I was trying to emphasize is that `y` did not overflow which is important for the comparison to work. I will rephrase it to make this clearer.

Before adding a comment about efficiency, I would like to understand better why this is more efficient and why it is important. Could you explain this please? Is it because it saves a subtraction occasionally, or are `>` comparisons generally faster than `>=`, or maybe would it help the compiler do branch elimination?

It's certainly *not* important. It's just that, out of two possible alternatives, the `>` alternative is slightly faster.

I don't think that there is a fundamental reason. It's just that the compiler generates more efficient instructions for the `>` variant.
