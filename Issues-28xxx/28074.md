This ticket:

- adds caching of univariate Macaulay2 polynomial rings;

- fixes an issue where, upon conversion of an ideal from Sage to Macaulay2, the Macaulay2 ring that is already cached does not get re-used, but is reconstructed instead;

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: R1 = macaulay2(R)
sage: I = R.ideal(y^2 - x)
sage: R2 = macaulay2(I).ring()
sage: R1._operator('===', R2)   # should be true
false
```

- moves `is_exact()` from `MPolynomialRing_macaulay2_repr` to `MPolynomialRing_base` where it seems to belong.

This is accomplished by refactoring and deduplicating some code related to the conversion. In some places, I replaced `_macaulay2_()` methods by implementations of `_macaulay2_init_()` which returns a string to be used as input for the Macaulay2 interpreter. This has the advantage that the generic interface mechanism in `sage.structure.sage_object` then takes care of the caching. The methods `_macaulay2_set_ring()` and `_macaulay2_base_str()` are removed.

(For the future – not in this ticket – it would also be nice to have caching when converting in the other direction, from Macaulay2 to Sage, so that the new Sage object remembers the Macaulay2 element it was constructed from. However, none of the interfaces seem to be doing this currently, as far as I can tell, so this could be more complicated to deal with.)

This branch is based on #27979 to avoid merge conflicts. Only the last commit is new. I tested this with Macaulay2 version 1.12 and Python 2 and 3.
