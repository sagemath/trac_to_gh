The zero element is always a special element. Therefore it should be treated as such. It should shorten computations and certainly be immutable. This ticket is devoted to that topic. (Similarly for the one element in the scalar field and mixed form algebra).

This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519.

**Features**

- an assertion error arises when altering the fixed elements zero or one
- a new attribute `_is_zero` is added to tensor fields and mixed form (similar to scalar fields)
- computations with involved zero or one are shortened by using a simple check
- due to immutability of algebra elements, no copies are returned anymore for scalar field operations with zero or one
- `_is_zero` attribute is applied for copies

The code snippet (see commits 5d30100 and ​d949a13) was quite messy. Well, it still is. At least it is readable and works for now. It gets a little bit better after merging (see #28519).

I will think about a better solution. But I guess, this requires a complete reorganization of the mixed form code.

After a bit of thinking, I came to the conclusion that the code snippet should be obsolete. (As a mathematician, I feel the urge to solve or fix a problem/error as soon as it occurs. Here: Doctest errors.) The thing is, due to our little discussion in #28519, the doctest must be flawed since mixed forms defined via preconstructed forms get altered.

So, I 'm going to delete this snippet again and modify the affected doctests.

Do you agree with my conclusion and procedure?

A further doctest change is devoted to #28578.

This is an example of how I used `add_comp_by_continuation` in the doctest. Obviously, this is a *bad* example. To ensure the "immutability" of mixed forms, the `comp` attribute should be used for already fully defined differential forms only. Whenever a incremental definition is explicitly wanted, `F[1][e_xy,0] = x` or `F[1] = M.one_form({e_xy: [x,0]}, name='omega')` should be used instead, and **then** `add_comp_by_continuation` is reasonable to use.

At least, that is my suggestion of how to use mixed forms.

Travis? Would you agree?

Yes, you're absolutely right. So, seeing things more from the mathematical point of view is always the way to go, right?

The problem here is that `add_comp_by_continuation` invokes the `add_comp` method for tensor fields which raises an error when it is used by the zero element. To make it usable in this case, a separate treatment of zero must be implemented.

I started the whole thing again from scratch since `add_comp_by_continuation` did not work properly in a mathematical manner.

Moreover, I (hopefully) improved the preexisting code.

In the commits, there are two alternatives presented: One using a flag `check_elements` and one using a separate method without security check. I'd prefer the second solution. It is completely hidden for the user and may become convenient when more checks are established in the future.

I've finally gone through the ticket. The impression stated in [comment:30](#comment%3A30) is confirmed: this is a nice improvement of the code! Thank you. I have made minor modifications, which have been pushed in the above branch. In particular 
- the pyflake error reported by the patchbot is corrected
- `t(0)` has been changed to `t.zero()` and `gl(1)` to `gl.one()` (to skip one function call)
- some `add/set_comp(basis)` have been changed to `add/set_comp(basis=basis)`
- the treatment of zero has been added in `FreeModuleTensor._sub_()`

Do you agree with these changes?

I just have two trivial changes:

```
and in `automorphismfield.py`:

```
    def add_comp(self, basis=None):
        r"""

        Return the components of ``self`` w.r.t. a given module basis for
        assignment, keeping the components w.r.t. other bases.

        To delete the components w.r.t. other bases, use the method

```
remove the blank line after `r"""` and same thing of spelling out `w.r.t.` (although I suspect this is done elsewhere, I think it is better to avoid abbreviations like this as this is a more "formal" document, but I don't care too much).
