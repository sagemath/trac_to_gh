I tried to be as careful as possible while merging the new tutorial into the previous one, but a second check that I didn't erase something I shouldn't would't be too much. 
Also feel free to correct any grammar and syntax mistake because my English is far from perfect.

<a id='comment:8'></a>J'ai corrigé des typos ici ou là, mais surtout il y a un gros passage avec des paragraphes qui apparaissent deux fois (chose que je n'ai pas osé corriger moi-même). Je donne les premiers mots des paragraphes concernés (ils sont presque tous consécutifs dans leurs deux versions, mais pas tous).

"In this interpretation of symmetric functions as characters" [...]

"The coproduct is an algebra morphism, and therefore" [...]

jusqu'à (je crois)

"Here are further examples [...]" 

et les examples qui suivent différent légèrement (f <--> g notamment) selon les deux copies
(pour trouver, au cas où: "coproduct().apply_multilinear_morphism( lambda x,y" [...]

C'est tout ce que j'ai relevé :)

I corrected the repetitions problems. 

About the references, I didn't change that, they were already in this file and I found other examples of .py files containing references. But if it is better to put them in the index.rst with the other references I can do it.

Mélodie, Sage does not like the non-ascii character for the accent in your name. I know some people with accents in their name choose to suppress them when their name appears in the Sage source code, though I don't know if this a rule or something they choose to do to make things easier. I took this approach since it is easier, but if you want the accent to appear, I believe you could use ` \'{e} `.

This is wrong. You just need to add at the first line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` that this should be interpreted as unicode (see, e.g., `combinat/tableau.py`).

2. it needs someone to review my rather substantial changes.

One thing I'm still a bit confused about: what is the compilation target for sf.py? Is it supposed to be read in-console? In html? As some kind of notebook? I'm seeing some constructs used that will probably look weird even in html, so I suspect some kind of interactive target is envisioned, but I don't know what it is.

I am not sure that sphinx will well-handle the `\limits`; I am also not sure how necessary it is. Plus you are missing a comma at the end (a number of `.. MATH::` lines have missing punctuation).

```diff

This one might be more stylistic, but I am not 100% certain:

Is `.. TOPIC::` valid? Might need to be `.. RUBRIC::`.

It might not be smart enough to handle this:

```
    .. TOPIC:: Solution

but it seems okay...

This seems misaligned:

You can't do nesting like this:

There might be more, and I definitely would make a bunch of other stylistic changes if I did a thorough pass through. Hopefully these will fix the docbuild.

Definitely style stuff:

For standardization:

-    :math:`\mathbb{Q}` ::

In fact, I would recommend removing all `:math:`f+2`` and just using ``f+2``. Similarly using `\QQ` instead of `\mathbb{Q`}.

General style: `.. rubric::` -> `.. RUBRIC::`.

Extra space here `syntax ,`.

I don't quite understand what you mean by this. The `:math:` is just outdated AFAIK.

This is a matter of standardization in Sage's documentation and is commonplace.

> I don't know about topics and rubrics. The indentation in the exercises does look weird to me, but I can't really see what comes out, so again I'd rather not change it. Anyone?


Well, we will need to get the doc to be compiled and looked at. Also, my understanding is a large part of this header is to be viewed as html documentation (possibly pdf, but I suspect that is a small number of people).

Okay, I just wasn't sure if it was handled or not. Thanks.
