I add the new tutorial we wrote with Melodie into the file sf.py and removed redundant examples in sfa.py
I tried to be as careful as possible while merging the new tutorial into the previous one, but a second check that I didn't erase something I shouldn't would't be too much. 
Also feel free to correct any grammar and syntax mistake because my English is far from perfect.

J'ai corrigé des typos ici ou là, mais surtout il y a un gros passage avec des paragraphes qui apparaissent deux fois (chose que je n'ai pas osé corriger moi-même). Je donne les premiers mots des paragraphes concernés (ils sont presque tous consécutifs dans leurs deux versions, mais pas tous).

"In this interpretation of symmetric functions as characters" [...]

"The coproduct is an algebra morphism, and therefore" [...]

jusqu'à (je crois)

"Here are further examples [...]" 

et les examples qui suivent différent légèrement (f <--> g notamment) selon les deux copies
(pour trouver, au cas où: "coproduct().apply_multilinear_morphism( lambda x,y" [...]

C'est tout ce que j'ai relevé :)

Thank you very much to both of you for reviewing. 
I corrected the repetitions problems. 

About the references, I didn't change that, they were already in this file and I found other examples of .py files containing references. But if it is better to put them in the index.rst with the other references I can do it.

Corrected some indentation/formatting issues that were causing problems with documentation build, checking with Patchbot now to see if it's better.

Mélodie, Sage does not like the non-ascii character for the accent in your name. I know some people with accents in their name choose to suppress them when their name appears in the Sage source code, though I don't know if this a rule or something they choose to do to make things easier. I took this approach since it is easier, but if you want the accent to appear, I believe you could use ` \'{e} `.

2. it needs someone to review my rather substantial changes.

One thing I'm still a bit confused about: what is the compilation target for sf.py? Is it supposed to be read in-console? In html? As some kind of notebook? I'm seeing some constructs used that will probably look weird even in html, so I suspect some kind of interactive target is envisioned, but I don't know what it is.

Possible errors:

```
    .. MATH:: h_d = \sum \limits_{\mu \vdash d} \dfrac{1}{z_{\mu}} p_{\mu}
```
I am not sure that sphinx will well-handle the `\limits`; I am also not sure how necessary it is. Plus you are missing a comma at the end (a number of `.. MATH::` lines have missing punctuation).

```diff
-the power-sum basis (a realization of :math:`\operatorname{Sym}`):
+the power-sum basis (a realization of :math:`\operatorname{Sym}`)::
```

This one might be more stylistic, but I am not 100% certain:

```diff
-    .. MATH:: p_k(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) = x_1^k + x_2^k + \ldots + x_n^k,
-                \ (\hbox{for any } k > 0),\ {\rm or}
-
-    .. MATH:: e_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n.
+    .. MATH::
+
+        p_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x_1^k + x_2^k + \ldots + x_n^k,
+               \quad (\hbox{for any } k > 0), \text{ or }
+
+   .. MATH::
+
+       e_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n.
```

Is `.. TOPIC::` valid? Might need to be `.. RUBRIC::`.

It might not be smart enough to handle this:

```
    .. TOPIC:: Solution

        ::
```
but it seems okay...

This seems misaligned:

```
        function, you should import it from ``sage.combinat.sf.sfa``.

    ::

        sage: from sage.combinat.sf.sfa import zee
        sage: zee([4,4,2,1])
        64
```
Actually, now I am confused about whether the `..TOPIC::` should be indented or not. You are inconsistent about this.

```diff
-This is already refined as `scalar_qt()`::
+This is already refined as ``scalar_qt()``::
```

You can't do nesting like this:

```
*Note that the n-th q,t-Catalan number can be computed using the command ``qt_catalan_number(n)``, which has to be imported from* ``sage.combinat.q_analogues`` if not done yet*.
```

Need blank lines probably:

```diff
     .. MATH::
+
         \Delta(g) = \sum_{\mu, \nu} a_{\mu,\nu}\, s_\mu\otimes s_\nu
 
     where
 
     .. MATH::
+
         g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})= \sum_{\mu, \nu} a_{\mu,\nu}\, s_\mu(\mathbf{x}) s_\nu(\mathbf{y}),
```

---

There might be more, and I definitely would make a bunch of other stylistic changes if I did a thorough pass through. Hopefully these will fix the docbuild.

---

Definitely style stuff:

For standardization:

```diff
-    :math:`\operatorname{Sym}` of symmetric functions over
-    :math:`\mathbb{Q}` ::
+    `\operatorname{Sym}` of symmetric functions over `\QQ`::
```
In fact, I would recommend removing all `:math:`f+2`` and just using ``f+2``. Similarly using `\QQ` instead of `\mathbb{Q`}.

General style: `.. rubric::` -> `.. RUBRIC::`.

Extra space here `syntax ,`.

Break the long line on line 348, the output of `s([5])^2*s([1,1,1])`.

`See also ``map_coefficients``.` -> `See also :meth:`~the.path.to.map_coefficients`.`

``t=1`.::` -> ``t=1`. ::`

This is a matter of standardization in Sage's documentation and is commonplace.

Well, we will need to get the doc to be compiled and looked at. Also, my understanding is a large part of this header is to be viewed as html documentation (possibly pdf, but I suspect that is a small number of people).
