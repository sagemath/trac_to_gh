The second half of the output varies, as sometimes the `AlarmInterrupt` is observed during one of the subsequent doctests of the file.

Ticket #26002 might be related, as the same error is mentioned there. The affected doctest was added in #8573 and is meant to check for memory leaks. Is this actually a memory leak?

The real cause seems to be `MemoryError: failed to allocate 33554432 * 24 bytes`

Is this a machine with few RAM?
