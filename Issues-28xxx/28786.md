Initial report.

Run the following fragment twice in the same Sage session.

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
sage: x = a^9
sage: y = a^21
sage: z = 1/x
sage: v = vector([y^i for i in range(7)])
sage: S = matrix([[(z^i)^j for j in range(7)] for i in range(7)])
sage: w = S*v
sage: w
```
The 1st run succeeds, the 2nd and later runs produce

```
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

      2 x = a**Integer(9)
      3 y = a**Integer(21)

    587                         raise ValueError("finite field modulus must be irreducible but it is not")

ValueError: the degree of the modulus does not equal the degree of the field
```

Note that this does not happen if modulus is not given.

This is a variable name clash. Somehow, using 'x' for modulus creates a problem.
If I instead define `K` as

```
sage: T.<xx> = GF(2)[]
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^6, modulus=xx^6 + xx^4 + xx^3 + xx + 1)
```
then everything works as expected.

perhaps making it imposible to use a symbolic variable to define modulus will do the trick. Indeed, if I do 

```
T.<x>=GF(2)[]
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
```
then the error goes away.

Strangely, `x` is the only symbolic variable that is accepted this way.
Trying to use a symbolic variable with a different name does not work

```
sage: var('tt'); K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=tt^6 + tt^4 + tt^3 + tt + 1)
...
TypeError: tt is not a variable of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
```
Does GF2X do something too smart with `x`?

I don't think this is a bug.  On the first run, you're taking advantage of the fact that `x` is predefined as a symbolic variable (and indeed, it's the only such variable).  The constructor for finite fields can take elements of the symbolic ring, though polynomials are better.  On the second, you've redefined `x`.

The error is triggered by just the following lines:

```
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
x = a^9
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
```

Perhaps a better error message in the case that modulus is a finite field element would be appropriate.

 ```
-T.<xx>=GF(2)[]
-K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=xx^6 + xx^4 + xx^3 + xx + 1)
+sage: T.<xx> = GF(2)[]
+sage: K.<a> = GF(2^6, modulus=xx^6 + xx^4 + xx^3 + xx + 1)
 ```
 then everything works as expected.

I agree. This ticket could do one or both of the following:

- include a cautionary example in the docstring
  for `FiniteField` (aka `GF`) (I recommend that)

- make the error message more helpful, such as:
  "check that the polynomial variable used in the modulus
  was indeed a polynomial variable, and not redefined
  to be a field element for instance" (maybe not needed
  if the docstring has a cautionary example)
