Presently, there is no way to construct a multi-variate polynomial ring based on a Singular ring with ring order with 'c' or 'C'. Singular ring order with 'c' or 'C' is useful if computation with modules over the ring is needed. 

This ticket aims to support constructing base Singular ring with ring order with 'c' or 'C'.

This enhancement is mainly for developers.

With the patch, we have for instance:

```
sage: T = TermOrder('degrevlex(2),lex(3)')
sage: P.<a,b,x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order=T)
sage: P._singular_()

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A5):
> what are these c/C orderings? I never heard of them...

Let R=k[x,y,z] and R<sup>3</sup> be a free module over R. Then an element of the free module is represented, in Singular, like

(x, -y, x+z) = x*gen(1) - y*gen(2) + (x+z)*gen(3)

That is, gen(1), gen(2), gen(3) denotes the "columns" of the free module. On the other hand, an element of R is viewed as

x<sup>3</sup>+z = (x<sup>3</sup>+z)*gen(1)

by Singular. The ordering of monomials of a free module is determined by ordering of monomial of R like x, y, x+z, ... and ordering of generators like gen(1), gen(2), ...

c/C ordering is ordering of the generators, and the position of c/C ordering in term order determine when to break ties by ordering of generators. TOP (term over position) and POT (position over term) are used to denote typical special cases. C denotes ascending order, and c denotes descending order.

Hence position of c/C ordering affects computations of Groebner bases in free modules over R. 

If you compute only over R, c/C ordering doesn't matter. But if you start computing on free modules over R in Singular, it does. But currently Sage does not allow to specify the position of c/C ordering when you create a polynomial ring based on Singular. Typically you want POT or `(c,dp)` in Singular string.

If you start computing with free modules over the Singular ring underlying (or derived from by `_singular_`) Sage polynomial ring, then you want to control c/C ordering (the default is TOP, c/C ordering at the end in term order).

This is a developer thing. Hence I decided to make the handle `_singular_ringorder_column` an underlined attribute.

I don't understand how this is "a developer thing". For actually carrying out computations orderings are essential, and for different tasks the user might want to choose a different order. So it should not be hidden from the user.

Then a user is just concerned with the `ModuleTermOrder` object, but not directly with _singular_ringorder_column`.

As a matter of fact, we're interested in getting `ChainComplex` functionality for modules over polynomial rings (Macaulay2 can do such computations).

But even without `ModuleTermOrder`, but with `c/C`, one would be able to do computations in modules over polynomial rings, no?

I just checked this:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
sage: type(R)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular'>
sage: M = R**3
sage: M
Ambient free module of rank 3 over the integral domain Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_ambient_domain_with_category'>
```

Apparently sage doesn't have  a `FreeModule_libsingular`. (If it had, then there would also be `ModuleTermOrder`) 

So sage doesn't have functionality for modules over polynomial rings like singular or macaulay2.

But sage has singular interface, and we can do

```
sage: I = R.ideal([x+y,x-y])
sage: Ising = I._singular_()
sage: Ising.syz()
-x+y,
x+y
sage: _.sage()
[-x + y]
[ x + y]
```

and the computation above would be affected by `c/C` ordering.

```
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 3
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
```
