The wedge product of differential forms was not compatible with scalar fields:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: a = M.diff_form(1, [x, y], name='a')
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x^2, name='f')
sage: a.wedge(f)
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-039619b3382c> in <module>()
      3 a = M.diff_form(Integer(1), [x, y], name='a')
      4 f = M.scalar_field(x**Integer(2), name='f')
----> 5 a.wedge(f)
...
AttributeError: 'DiffScalarFieldAlgebra_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute '_ambient_domain'
```

In this ticket, this gets fixed.

This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519.

A general comment: when you create a ticket, do not fill the "Reviewers" field; it will be filled by the reviewers themselves when they are actually making the review. If you want to suggest a reviewer for your ticket, simply add its username to the "Cc" field.
