This ticket modifies the FriCAS interface so that symbolic ring elements are always converted to FriCAS `Expression Integer` or `Expression Complex Integer`, depending on whether the complex unit appears.  Doing so, we fix the failure below.

see https://ask.sagemath.org/question/48431/why-this-integral-fail-using-fricas-algorithm/

for the original bug report:

```
integrate(sqrt(2)*x^2 + 2*x,x, algorithm="fricas")
```

Yes, but the solutions are orthogonal to each other.  In other words: after applying this branch, #28641 solves a different problem.

Put differently, the complex unit `I` is not an element of `Expression Integer`, but would have to be expressed as `sqrt(-1)`.  I see the following options:

1. rewrite `I` as `sqrt(-1)`,
2. always use `Expression Complex Integer`,
3. detect whether `I` appears and distinguish accordingly,
4. somehow let FriCAS decide

I tend towards option 1., but I am not sure at all.
