This ticket is a follow-up to #27967. It makes the following changes related to enumeration orders of `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`:

• implements (and documents) a certified enumeration order for breadth-first search of recursively enumerated sets (left-to-right traversal). The graded case has already been implemented in #27967. In particular, this gives consistent results between Python 2 and 3, also for the generic and symmetric case.

  (The depth-first search already returns consistent results – this ticket adds this fact to its documentation as well.)

• further optimizes the implementation of breadth-first search as suggested in [ticket:27967#comment:15]. With this, elements are generally returned much earlier during the search: by an entire generation earlier. In other words, it is possible to explore one level further before potentially running out of memory.

• implements a custom breadth-first search iterator for `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_symmetric` (this is necessary because the previous implementation was based on `graded_component()` which returns unordered sets). As a result, `_breadth_first_search_iterator_from_graded_component_iterator()` is not used anymore and therefore removed.

• fixes an off-by-one error in the `max_depth` of the breadth-first iterator for RES of `symmetric` structure:

  ```
  sage: f = lambda a: [a-1, a+1]
  sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f)
  sage: D = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f, structure='symmetric')
  sage: sorted(C.breadth_first_search_iterator(max_depth=2))
  [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
  sage: sorted(D.breadth_first_search_iterator(max_depth=2))  # should be the same
  [-1, 0, 1]
  ```

After these changes, only the `naive` enumeration order will give unordered results, as is clearly stated in its documentation, as well as the function `graded_component()` (and consequently `graded_component_iterator()` as well as `elements_of_depth_iterator()`), as `graded_component()` returns an unordered `set` of elements rather than an iterator of its elements.

Moreover, this ticket should allow to revert the workaround implemented in #28227 and might also help with #28539.
