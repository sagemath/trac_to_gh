```
As reported in this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/_wwyqHmE5Lg/M24X8Mv_AAAJ), some integral computations may go through SymPy and return a `RootSum` object, which has currently no translation to Sage (cf. #16816)

```
sage: integrate(1/(x^4 + x^3 + 1), x)
...
AttributeError: 'RootSum' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```
Until #16816 is solved, the current ticket proposes a quick fix by catching the `AttributeError` as if no valid result were found, so that we get 

```
sage: integrate(1/(x^4 + x^3 + 1), x)
integrate(1/(x^4 + x^3 + 1), x)
```
which was the behavior prior to Sage 8.9, i.e. prior to the automatic use of SymPy if Maxima fails.
