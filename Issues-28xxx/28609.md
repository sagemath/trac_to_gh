```
sage:PolynomialRing(Qp(2), 3, 'x')({(0,0,0):O(2)}).dict()
{}
```
instead of
`{(0,0,0):O(2)}`

As a side effect substitution and addition is also broken:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = Qp(2)[]
sage: f = x  + y + z - 1
sage: f.dict()
{(0, 0, 0): 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10 + 2^11 + 2^12 + 2^13 + 2^14 + 2^15 + 2^16 + 2^17 + 2^18 + 2^19 + O(2^20),
 (0, 0, 1): 1 + O(2^20),
 (0, 1, 0): 1 + O(2^20),
 (1, 0, 0): 1 + O(2^20)}
sage: f.substitute(x=Qp(2)(1).add_bigoh(1)).dict()
{(0, 0, 1): 1 + O(2^20), (0, 1, 0): 1 + O(2^20)}
sage: f((Qp(2)(1).add_bigoh(1),y,z)).dict()
{(0, 0, 1): 1 + O(2^20), (0, 1, 0): 1 + O(2^20)}
```

While I would expect: `{(0, 0, 1): 1 + O(2^20), (0, 1, 0): 1 + O(2^20), (0,0,0): O(2)}`
and

```
sage: (f + (1 + O(2))).dict()
{(1, 0, 0): 1 + O(2^20), (0, 0, 1): 1 + O(2^20), (0, 1, 0): 1 + O(2^20)}
```

Alex Best, pointed out that most likely this has to do with a 
key removal being done with
`if blah == 0:` instead of `if blah.is_zero()`

The problem is in the PolyDict __add__ function calls the PolyDict constructor with zero=K.zero() and remove_zeroes=True, this is quite awkward as it makes it hard to fix this while maintaining that variables with exact zero coefficient removed. Maybe this should be changed so that if PolyDict constructor is called with remove_zeroes=True then the base ring `.is_zero()` method is called. Possibly this is a performance hit though?

the offending lines are 

```
if pdict[k] == zero:
    del pdict[k]
```
in sage/rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx


As for the constructor issue, it is the same with line `x = polydict.PolyDict(x, parent.base_ring()(0), remove_zero=True)` in `sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py` that does it.

Julian mentioned there's at least one more ticket about this somewhere

On side a note, univariate polynomials seem to do the right thing:

```
sage: f = PolynomialRing(Qp(2),'a')([O(2),O(2^3)])
sage: f
O(2^3)*a + O(2)
```
