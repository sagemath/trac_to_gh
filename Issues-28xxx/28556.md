```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: s = G('(1,2,3)')
sage: s.word_problem?
```
The output does not explain the meaning of the parameters, is badly formatted, etc.

And the code was also wrong when the subgroup is not the full group, e.g.

```
s.word_problem([s])
```
should express `s` as a one-letter word over the generating set `[s]`.
