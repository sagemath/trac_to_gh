The patch of #27634 caused a regression by removing 

```
from __future__ import absolute_import
```
statements in several modules in the coding package. The author erroneously thought that the statement is not necessary from python 2.7. 

This ticket fixes the regression.

I removed them deliberately, because I thought them unnecessary.  In another ticket #28096, Simon asked why I removed such imports, and then I realized that I had thought wrong. 

This is tiny, but nonetheless a regression.

To avoid ambiguity with relative imports. For example, for

`from sage import ...`

Python, with absolute_import, only look for `sage` in top-level `sys.path` but not in the directory of the present module.

> Why are they not in all `.py`-files in `src/sage/coding`?


Perhaps, people add them only to clear ambiguity. It also seems to me that with absolute_import, python gets a bit more efficient in looking for modules.

If you think adding back absolute_import is just a fuss with little real gain, then it is ok with me to throw away this ticket.

No, they were added by Fréderic Chapoton in #20991 (see git-blame).

It does not make sense to me to just mindlessly add back those `absolute_import` if they have no function. Either we should forget this ticket, because those `absolute_import`s do not serve much function, or we should take this opportunity to put `absolute_import` on all the `.py` files in `sage/coding`.

Fréderic, could you advise us?

Never ever remove any `from __future__ import something` until sage is officially switched to python3 only.
