The patch of #27634 caused a regression by removing 

```
from __future__ import absolute_import
```
statements in several modules in the coding package. The author erroneously thought that the statement is not necessary from python 2.7. 

This ticket fixes the regression.

How did you find out?
Is there a way I can see the difference, or alternatively do you have a link to a ticket or a sage-devel thread where it is stated we need these?
Best,

I removed them deliberately, because I thought them unnecessary.  In another ticket #28096, Simon asked why I removed such imports, and then I realized that I had thought wrong. 

This is tiny, but nonetheless a regression.

To avoid ambiguity with relative imports. For example, for

`from sage import ...`

Python, with absolute_import, only look for `sage` in top-level `sys.path` but not in the directory of the present module.

> Why are they not in all `.py`-files in `src/sage/coding`?

Perhaps, people add them only to clear ambiguity. It also seems to me that with absolute_import, python gets a bit more efficient in looking for modules.

If you think adding back absolute_import is just a fuss with little real gain, then it is ok with me to throw away this ticket.

No, they were added by Fréderic Chapoton in #20991 (see git-blame).

It does not make sense to me to just mindlessly add back those `absolute_import` if they have no function. Either we should forget this ticket, because those `absolute_import`s do not serve much function, or we should take this opportunity to put `absolute_import` on all the `.py` files in `sage/coding`.

Fréderic, could you advise us?

My opinion :

Never ever remove any <code>from \`__future__\` import something</code> until sage is officially switched to python3 only.
