I noticed in a recent build of Sage on a Debian buster VM, using many system packages, a problem:

Every time I try to re-build, whether I run `make build`, `sage -b`, etc. two Python modules get recompiled (from their Cython-generated C sources, though Cython itself is not being re-run). Specifically,

```
src/build/cythonized/sage/modules/vector_mod2_dense.c
src/build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.c
```

One of the things that these two modules have in common, and unique from other modules (as listed in src/module_list.py) is their dependency on `SAGE_INC + '/png.h'`.  But since I'm using the system libpng, this file does not exist, so those modules constantly get rebuilt.

I'm not really sure the best thing to do about this right now.  Maybe we should only add those headers to the `depends` list if they actually exist (and just assume that system headers won't be updated often...)

This file doesn't actually depend on `png.h` in any way that I can see, so we should just drop that dependency (regardless of whether it fixes the issue on this ticket).

It does depend indirectly through gd.h, which it does depend on directly.  But I agree it's a bit odd to include png.h in that list explicitly.

this one has been fixed, but similar problems pop up elsewhere, e.g. I saw similar parasite rebuilds with
the branch of #29369 (currently disabled) - apparently 

```
    Extension('sage.rings.polynomial.pbori',
              sources = ['sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx'],
              libraries=['brial', 'brial_groebner'] + m4ri_libs + png_libs,
              library_dirs = m4ri_library_dirs + png_library_dirs,
              include_dirs = m4ri_include_dirs + png_include_dirs,
              depends = [SAGE_INC + "/polybori/" + hd + ".h" for hd in ["polybori", "config"]],
              extra_compile_args = m4ri_extra_compile_args),
```
