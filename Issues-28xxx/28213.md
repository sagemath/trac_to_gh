<a id='comment:20'></a>I have an example that takes much longer than it should. Looks like it is because in all_preperiodic_points. there is no way to pass in the algorithm parameter

```
R.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
K.<v> = NumberField(t^3 + 16*t^2 - 10496*t + 94208)
PS.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f = DynamicalSystem([x^2-29/16*y^2,y^2])
```
with the 'lifting' algorithm it is fast, with the default it is very slow.
