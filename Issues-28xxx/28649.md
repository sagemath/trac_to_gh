It may be possible to do this cross-platform in a relatively convenient way with ctypes anyway:

```
import ctypes
libc = ctypes.CDLL(ctypes.util.find_library("c"))
libc.fflush(0r)
```
seems to work, and looking at the source, it seems "find_library" does make an effort to be cross-platform. It's probably worth considering if this will do, since it's a lot lighter weight than running cython.

Any opinions on which approach to take? I see three options:

1. Keep the current branch. Slow, requires a functioning Cython compiler. (Is that guaranteed with binary releases?)

2. Add the `cyflush` function to the Sage library so that it is precompiled.

3. Take the `ctypes` approach from [comment:17](#comment%3A17), with `libc = ctypes.CDLL(None)`.

Any opinions? I would like to get a solution to this problem merged, because there are people out there using non-Sage versions of FLINT.
