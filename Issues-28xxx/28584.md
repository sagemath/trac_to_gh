This option allows specification of the render order of transparent objects. These render from lowest to highest value ensuring that lower-valued objects render completely. This can help with known transparency issues.

Test case:


```
var("x, y, z, a, b")
E1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - a^2 == 0
E2 = x^2 + y^2 - b^2*z^2 == 0
P1=implicit_plot3d(E1.lhs().subs([a==2]),(x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), (z, -2, 2),
                   color="blue", opacity=0.5)
P2=implicit_plot3d(E2.lhs().subs([b==1]),(x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), (z, -2, 2),
                   color="yellow", opacity=0.5, render_order=-1)
(P1+P2).show()
```
