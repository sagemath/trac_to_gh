The `sage` target in src/Makefile can be called if the previous build was incomplete, in particular if six has not been installed. But our setup.py implicitly depends on six:

The original build was with Python 2. The failure resulted from

```
git pull
make
```
So I presume it's still Python 2.

From sage folder

```
make distclean
make
```
seemed to fix things here. I'm not anxious to continue with Python 2 and with the above Python 3 is being used. It seems a bit severe but perhaps what's needed.
