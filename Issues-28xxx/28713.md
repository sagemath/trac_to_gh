Since the whole framework bases on symbolic expressions, there is no barrier of introducing the aforementioned coordinates as chart coordinates (I've made an example for characteristic classes where I did this. Perhaps you should take a detailed look an that after I'll have uploaded it). But somehow, this feels like an abuse.

Yes there is no barrier at the moment and actually we already played this game in the past, see cell [36] of [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v1.3/SM_Simon-Mars_Kerr.ipynb), which introduces a self-dual complex 2-form.
