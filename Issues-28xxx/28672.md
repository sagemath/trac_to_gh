RIght now there is no visible confirmation that the functionality is working. We could also have a pop-up alert with the same string, but I'm not particularly fond of those because they break the flow and create extra work.

Try it out for a few examples and let me know if this is close to what you want. The projection in the tikz images appears to be orthogonal, so it doesn't look exactly the same to me as the web page graphic.
