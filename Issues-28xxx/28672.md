Jean-Philippe, this is a preliminary version of the functionality you're currently using in jmol. The menu option "Camera Info" has been changed to "Get Viewpoint". When selected it will copy a string of the form "[x,y,z] angle" to your clipboard, which you can then paste directly into the Sage command.

RIght now there is no visible confirmation that the functionality is working. We could also have a pop-up alert with the same string, but I'm not particularly fond of those because they break the flow and create extra work.

Try it out for a few examples and let me know if this is close to what you want. The projection in the tikz images appears to be orthogonal, so it doesn't look exactly the same to me as the web page graphic.

After all of the effort it took to build 9.beta6, I've copied the same code to a new branch based on that version. Don't want to have to rebuild any previous versions at this point.

Jean-Philippe, if you want to get this into Sage 9 then I need to hear from you sooner rather than later.
