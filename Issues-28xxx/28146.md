```
The ``EllipticCurveIsogeny`` class only accepts kernels formed by points in the elliptic curve, but not points in the Torsion subgroup, even though they are the same points. 

For example one should be able to create an elliptic curve isogeny where the kernel is taken directly from the torsion subgroup rather than the abelian group of the elliptic curve:


```     
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: P = E.torsion_subgroup().gens()[0]
sage: EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, kernel=P)
Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 7820*x - 263580 over Rational Field
sage: EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, kernel=E(P)) == EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, kernel=P)
True
```


Keywords: Elliptic Curves, Isogenies, Kernel
