In Cygwin under Windows, unpacking archives sometimes leads
to a permission problem.

This is due to Windows locking files when they are opened
by another application, and might mean an antivirus inspecting
a file prevents you from writing to it.

Building Sage in Cygwin in Windows 7 on some computer reliably
failed before this ticket, and reliably works with it.
