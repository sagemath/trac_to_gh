In Cygwin under Windows, unpacking archives sometimes leads
to a permission problem.

This is due to Windows locking files when they are opened
by another application, and might mean an antivirus inspecting
a file prevents you from writing to it.

Building Sage in Cygwin in Windows 7 on some computer reliably
failed before this ticket, and reliably works with it.

FWIW the `retry=len(archive.names)` is pretty arbitrary here.  It's just setting the number of retries needed to a factor of the number of files extracted (that might be getting checked one by one by a virus scanner or whatever).  In practice it should need way fewer retries than this since the default retry is every 1s.
