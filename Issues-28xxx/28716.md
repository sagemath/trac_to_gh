This ticket modifies `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()` to allow for constructing a vector frame from a spanning family of linearly independent vector fields:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: e0 = M.vector_field(1+x^2, 1+y^2)
sage: e1 = M.vector_field(2, -x*y)
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e', (e0, e1)); e
Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1))
sage: e[0].display()
e_0 = (x^2 + 1) d/dx + (y^2 + 1) d/dy
sage: e[1].display()
e_1 = 2 d/dx - x*y d/dy
sage: (e[0], e[1]) == (e0, e1)
True
```
Previously, the only way to introduce the vector frame `e` was to first introduce the automorphism relating the frame `(d/dx, d/dy)` to `(e0, e1)` and to pass this automorphism to `VectorFrame.new_frame()`:

```
sage: aut = M.automorphism_field()
sage: aut[:] = [[e0[0], e1[0]], [e0[1], e1[1]]]
sage: e = X.frame().new_frame(aut, 'e')
```


**Implementation details:** such functionality already existed for bases of finite rank free modules; the relevant code is extracted from the method `FiniteRankFreeModule.basis()` and put into the new method `FreeModuleBasis._init_from_family()`, in order to be used in `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()` as well.

This is a great idea and would be very useful for vector bundles, too. Sometimes I got really annoyed by this detour. Would you mind to adapt your code, if working, for vector bundles as-well?

By the way: We should combine vector bundles and the previous implementations really really soon (in this case inherit vector frames from local frames) otherwise things could get extremly messy.

Unfortunately, I am quite busy working at my master thesis right now. I can almost feel the deadline touching my skin. I promise to work on that as soon as I've gained some time back.

Even though I don't have the time now, I've opened the corresponding ticket #28718, just to keep this task in mind.

In the latest version (cf. [comment:8](#comment%3A8) commits) 

- `vector_frame()` accepts a tuple/list of vector fields as a positional argument, the keyword argument `from_family` being suppressed, following the suggestion made in [comment:4](#comment%3A4).
- The `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs if the vector fields are not linearly independent (the exception is raised when computing the inverse of the automorphism relating the new frame to a previous one) is cached with a proper error message.
- The documentation of the module `sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorframe` has been updated to take into account the new functionality.
- `TensorBundle.local_frame()` has been updated to offer the same functionality, following [comment:5](#comment%3A5).
- A `TODO` section has been added to `TopologicalVectorBundle.local_frame()` for implementing a similar functionality with local sections in the future.

I propose to stay here for this ticket, i.e. to let the modification of `TopologicalVectorBundle.local_frame()` to a future ticket (#28718 ?). This is mostly to avoid code duplication with `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()`, waiting for a clearer view of #28718. Besides, I will be extremely busy in the coming weeks and I would like very much the `vector_frame()` functionality introduced in the current ticket to make its way in Sage 9.0.

 **Implementation details:** such functionality already existed for bases of finite rank free modules; the relevant code is extracted from the method `FiniteRankFreeModule.basis()` and put into the new method `FreeModuleBasis._init_from_family()`, in order to be used in `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()` as well.

Partially. Of course, we can postpone this to another ticket, preferrably to #28718. However, I think this fits in here perfectly well and enables the feature for vector bundles in Sage 9.0 without too much effort [1] as you already did it for the tensor bundle. But I have no strong opinion on that so just do as you prefer.

One personal reformulation:

```diff
-        any connection with previously defined vector frames or vector fields
-        (the connection can be performed later via the method

OK I've done it in the above commit. I've also improved the catching of the error in case of linearly dependent elements.

There is one thing I'm not sure about. Namely the line:


```
            mat = [[c[[i]] for c in comps] for i in fmodule.irange()]
            aut.add_comp(basis)[:] = mat
   this --> aut.add_comp(self)[:] = mat
            fmodule.set_change_of_basis(basis, self, aut)

Shouldn't it be the identity matrix with respect to that basis? Or did I get something wrong?

Not sure. But to run some tests for my thesis, I merged these two tickets and a conflict occured. Just a very minor thing about lines if I remember correctly.

However, either ticket needs to be merged to be certain.
