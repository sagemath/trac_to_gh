This ticket modifies `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()` to allow for constructing a vector frame from a spanning family of linearly independent vector fields:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: e0 = M.vector_field(1+x^2, 1+y^2)
sage: e1 = M.vector_field(2, -x*y)
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e', (e0, e1)); e
Vector frame (M, (e_0,e_1))
sage: e[0].display()
e_0 = (x^2 + 1) d/dx + (y^2 + 1) d/dy
sage: e[1].display()
e_1 = 2 d/dx - x*y d/dy
sage: (e[0], e[1]) == (e0, e1)
True
```
Previously, the only way to introduce the vector frame `e` was to first introduce the automorphism relating the frame `(d/dx, d/dy)` to `(e0, e1)` and to pass this automorphism to `VectorFrame.new_frame()`:

```
sage: aut = M.automorphism_field()
sage: aut[:] = [[e0[0], e1[0]], [e0[1], e1[1]]]
sage: e = X.frame().new_frame(aut, 'e')
```


**Implementation details:** such functionality already existed for bases of finite rank free modules; the relevant code is extracted from the method `FiniteRankFreeModule.basis()` and put into the new method `FreeModuleBasis._init_from_family()`, in order to be used in `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()` as well.

This is a great idea and would be very useful for vector bundles, too. Sometimes I got really annoyed by this detour. Would you mind to adapt your code, if working, for vector bundles as-well?

By the way: We should combine vector bundles and the previous implementations really really soon (in this case inherit vector frames from local frames) otherwise things could get extremly messy.

Unfortunately, I am quite busy working at my master thesis right now. I can almost feel the deadline touching my skin. I promise to work on that as soon as I've gained some time back.

In the latest version (cf.[comment:8](#comment%3A8) commits) 

- `vector_frame()` accepts a tuple/list of vector fields as a positional argument, the keyword argument `from_family` being suppressed, following the suggestion made in[comment:4](#comment%3A4).
- The `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs if the vector fields are not linearly independent (the exception is raised when computing the inverse of the automorphism relating the new frame to a previous one) is cached with a proper error message.
- The documentation of the module `sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorframe` has been updated to take into account the new functionality.
- `TensorBundle.local_frame()` has been updated to offer the same functionality, following[comment:5](#comment%3A5).
- A `TODO` section has been added to `TopologicalVectorBundle.local_frame()` for implementing a similar functionality with local sections in the future.

I propose to stay here for this ticket, i.e. to let the modification of `TopologicalVectorBundle.local_frame()` to a future ticket (#28718 ?). This is mostly to avoid code duplication with `DifferentiableManifold.vector_frame()`, waiting for a clearer view of #28718. Besides, I will be extremely busy in the coming weeks and I would like very much the `vector_frame()` functionality introduced in the current ticket to make its way in Sage 9.0.

Partially. Of course, we can postpone this to another ticket, preferrably to #28718. However, I think this fits in here perfectly well and enables the feature for vector bundles in Sage 9.0 without too much effort [1] as you already did it for the tensor bundle. But I have no strong opinion on that so just do as you prefer.

There is one thing I'm not sure about. Namely the line:


```
            mat = [[c[[i]] for c in comps] for i in fmodule.irange()]
            aut.add_comp(basis)[:] = mat
   this --> aut.add_comp(self)[:] = mat
            fmodule.set_change_of_basis(basis, self, aut)
```

Shouldn't it be the identity matrix with respect to that basis? Or did I get something wrong?

The formula is correct: it should not be the identity matrix but the matrix of the change-of-basis automorphism, which has the same expression in both bases.

Not sure. But to run some tests for my thesis, I merged these two tickets and a conflict occured. Just a very minor thing about lines if I remember correctly.

However, either ticket needs to be merged to be certain.
