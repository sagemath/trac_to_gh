The method `product_on_basis` of `PoincareBirkhoffWittBasis` has `cached_method` decorator. When multiplying many large PBW elements, this causes serious memory usage.

In fact, clearing the cache or removing parent objects does not clear this memory, and there seems to be a memory leak. Removing the decorator fixes this problem.

I saw only minor speedup with caching, it probably depends on the use case. 

I now tried to reproduce the memory leak, but I was unable. I suspect the following happened: During long computations the memory kept increasing, and to figure out why I actually interrupted the kernel (because I was too impatient for the computation to finish first). I noticed there were was a very large count of dictionary objects in memory. Using the following code I saw most of them were referenced by a `IndexedFreeAbelianMonoid_with_category.element_class`, or `PoincareBirkhoffWittBasis_with_category.element_class` and nothing else (a very short backreference chain. It seems when interrupting the kernel the cached things lose their reference to the cache, but otherwise stay alive. But one shouldn't interrupt the kernel during normal usage, so this isn't so bad.

 ```python
 import random
 import objgraph
 
 objgraph.show_backrefs(random.choice(objgraph.by_type('dict')))
```

Without `@cached_method` I do see higher memory usage, even after calling `.clear_cache()` periodically. I'm not sure why, but this requires further investigation on my part. 

Also it seems that the cache is particularly useful for monomials of low degree which are often looked up. High degree monomials need more memory to store and are only rarely looked up. Is it possible to selectively clear the cache only of monomials of high degree? I suppose one could access the cache directly, but I don't immediately see how. Something should have a `_cache__product_on_basis` property, but it's not the function `product_on_basis` itself. 

I would love to contribute some of my code to sage. I have some ideas of things I now know how to do that would be nice to add to sage. I would probably need some guidance on style and some of the inner workings of sage to do this properly.

As you indicated, doing things with larger monomials is likely to not benefit as much from the caching since you are creating and seeing more monomials than previous times.

Yea, I am not sure how much protections there are in `@cached_method` for interruptions. It may also be a difficult-to-impossible problem to solve in general too.

Depends on precisely how you are calling it.

Thanks, I'll try that.

Yes implementing my own cache is easy, and I already did it in a number of places before I even figured out the `@cached_method` decorator exists.

Indeed I tried making some things faster by implementening them myself. However the speedup of this only turned out to be minor, and I still have a bunch of code that should fit better in the general framework of sage. 

In particular noticed there is very little code for Lie algebra representations in sagemath. I was thinking of contributing in this regard. Can I send you an email at some point with some of my ideas? Or is there particular place where I should put these kind of proposals?

Since this ticket has gone very far off topic, and my issue turned out to be stupid, I guess this ticket should be closed, but I don't see how to do this.

I looked into this. So you can just delete from the `Foo.bar.cache` dict object to clear objects from the cache I believe.

There are probably ways you can improve the multiplication to involve less indirection and temporary objects, both of which will get you some more speed.
