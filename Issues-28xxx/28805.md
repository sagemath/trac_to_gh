We took care of removing all the dependencies to sagenb during build, in particular, the build of documentation. We also have switched to python3 by default but sagenb is still installed in python3 builds because of its presence in `DOC_DEPENDENCIES`. It should be removed.

The script `sage-rst2txt` contains the line

```
from sagenb.notebook.docHTMLProcessor import docutilsHTMLProcessor
```
and that import is in fact used.

As I said in [comment:2](#comment%3A2), we could tag the relevant tests as `# optional - sagenb`, but I think we will eventually want to delete tests marked `# py2`, and then we might forget to deal with tests marked with `sagenb` instead.

The purpose of `sage-rst2txt` is "Translate a rst file into a worksheet txt file." I'm not sure what a "worksheet txt file" is, but I think it's for SageNB. So I don't see the point of separating `sage-rst2txt` from `sagenb`.
