Here is a x50 slower example

```
sage: x,y = polygens(QQ,"x,y")
sage: p1 = x^5 + 6*x^4 - 42*x^3 - 142*x^2 + 467*x + 422
sage: p2 = p1(x=(x-1)^2)
sage: p3 = p2(x=x*y).resultant(p2,x).univariate_polynomial()
sage: p4, = [f[0] for f in p3.factor() if f[0].degree() == 80]
sage: %time _ = p4.squarefree_decomposition()
CPU times: user 807 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 807 µs
Wall time: 883 µs
sage: %time _ = p4.change_ring(AA).squarefree_decomposition()
CPU times: user 40.1 s, sys: 3.21 ms, total: 40.1 s
Wall time: 40.1 s
```
This problem originally appeared in #17895 (where a better workaround has been found).

You were quick :-) This is great: 10x improvement! There is no hope to beat the C-implementation from flint anyway.

Do you know why the subresultant is not the default method over fields? Could it be always better?

Of course, but I would hope for less than a second...

> 
> Do you know why the subresultant is not the default method over fields? Could it be always better?  

That's why my first try. The problem is that it requires a `_floordiv_` and not all fields have it. For instance:

```python
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: p = (x^2-1)^2
sage: p.is_squarefree()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for //: 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision'
```

or 

```python
sage: S.<y> = GF(5)[]
sage: Q = S.quotient_ring(y^2+y+1)
sage: T.<z> = Q[]
sage: gcd(y*z+1, z + y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for //: 'Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Finite Field of size 5 with modulus y^2 + y + 1' and 'Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Finite Field of size 5 with modulus y^2 + y + 1'
```

One possibility to check is whether adding a `_floordiv_` method that simply calls `self._div_(other)` in the `Fields` category is sufficient and yields better timings.
