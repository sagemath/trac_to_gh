Here is a x50 slower example

```
sage: x,y = polygens(QQ,"x,y")
sage: p1 = x^5 + 6*x^4 - 42*x^3 - 142*x^2 + 467*x + 422
sage: p2 = p1(x=(x-1)^2)
sage: p3 = p2(x=x*y).resultant(p2,x).univariate_polynomial()
sage: p4, = [f[0] for f in p3.factor() if f[0].degree() == 80]
sage: %time _ = p4.squarefree_decomposition()
CPU times: user 807 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 807 µs
Wall time: 883 µs
sage: %time _ = p4.change_ring(AA).squarefree_decomposition()
CPU times: user 40.1 s, sys: 3.21 ms, total: 40.1 s
Wall time: 40.1 s
```
This problem originally appeared in #17895 (where a better workaround has been found).

I've made a very quick try: Instead of using the plain old Euclidean algorithm, one can use the so-called subresultant algorithm. This algorithm is already provided for UFDs so I tried to branch this algorithms for fields also. The resulting timings are still bad, but slightly less so:

```python

sage: p2 = p1(x=(x-1)^2)
sage: p3 = p2(x=x*y).resultant(p2,x).univariate_polynomial()
sage: p4, = [f[0] for f in p3.factor() if f[0].degree() == 80]
sage: %time _ = p4.squarefree_decomposition()

You were quick :-) This is great: 10x improvement! There is no hope to beat the C-implementation from flint anyway.

Do you know why the subresultant is not the default method over fields? Could it be always better?  

This reminds me the problem for computing determinant of matrices with rational coefficients. Going via Gauss elimination (which is a sort of "default" for fields) will create a terrible coefficient blowup.

Of course, but I would hope for less than a second...

> 
> Do you know why the subresultant is not the default method over fields? Could it be always better?  

That's why my first try. The problem is that it requires a `_floordiv_` and not all fields have it. For instance:

```python
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: p = (x^2-1)^2
sage: p.is_squarefree()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for //: 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Real Field with 53 bits of precision'
```

or 

```python
sage: S.<y> = GF(5)[]
sage: Q = S.quotient_ring(y^2+y+1)
sage: T.<z> = Q[]
sage: gcd(y*z+1, z + y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for //: 'Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Finite Field of size 5 with modulus y^2 + y + 1' and 'Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in ybar over Finite Field of size 5 with modulus y^2 + y + 1'
```

One possibility to check is whether adding a `_floordiv_` method that simply calls `self._div_(other)` in the `Fields` category is sufficient and yields better timings.
