The algorithm is described here: http://dept-info.labri.fr/~gavoille/article/DG07. Using this traversal we can approximate the tree-length of an arbitrary graph. The complexity of this algorithm will be ***O(nm)*** where ***n*** is the number of vertices and ***m*** the number of edges if implemented properly in Cython.

You tried to follow the algorithm from Dourisboure and Gavoille, right ? It's not easy to recognize it.

I tried the algorithm and I doubt it is correct. For a PetersenGraph, the ordering is `0, 1, .., 9`.

Also I don't like the way you manipulate strings. You could directly have string labels, no ?

You should read the original paper by Rose, Tarjan and Luecker 1976 https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0205021 . 
It provides other algorithms.

I have now a working implementation of the algorithms in sections 4 and 5.3. Both versions give same orders, but the one of section 5.3 is of course way faster. I'm not claiming the orders I produce are correct. Not easy to guess what the output should be.

I will push my code to save you time, but before if want to understand what you did and if there is an error and where. So please add some comments.

The reason I didn't choose to have string labels in the first place is that the labels will be used for the tree decomposition later so strings would only make the parsing harder. Also, the conversion to string is needed if we want to use C++ queue.

The general idea is that when we assign a number to a vertex we start a BFS-like procedure from that vertex. In the queue, we are keeping two things: the vertex and the maximum label in the path from our initial vertex to this one. We take care of the case when a vertex is already numbered or examined earlier (`if int_neighbor in vertices and not int_neighbor in seen:`).

<a id='comment:50'></a>- R. Endre Tarjan -> Robert Endre Tarjan
- the front-end method can be defined directly in `traversals.pyx`.
- in the example `LexM produces an ordering of the vertices`, you should not only check the len of the output, but also that all vertices are in (compare sets)
- you can show an ordering in an example
- add explanation for the test ` Both algorithms produce a valid LexM ordering`, i.e., what is a valid ordering
- The triangulation contains original graph edges, so we can directly do `H = Graph(F, format='list_of_edges')`
- I don't like the names `lex_M_slow` and `lex_M_fast`, and it's quite complicated for users to type. We can keep these names for the methods, but it would be better to find simple and clear names for the algorithms.
- `algorithm == None` -> `algorithm is None` or simply `not algorithm`

- remove the terms efficient and inefficient in the table of methods

- use latex (you also have to replace a `"""` by `r"""`

```diff
-    Note that instead of using labels 1, 2, ..., k and adding 1/2, we use labels
-    2, 4, ..., k and add 1, thus avoiding to use floats or rationals.
+    Note that instead of using labels `1, 2, \ldots, k` and adding `1/2`, we use labels
+    `2, 4, \ldots, k` and add `1`, thus avoiding to use floats or rationals.
```

- a possible improvement, but I'm not sure it makes a difference.

```diff
-                        F.append((int_to_v[v], int_to_v[z]))
+                        if triangulation:
+                            F.append((int_to_v[v], int_to_v[z]))
