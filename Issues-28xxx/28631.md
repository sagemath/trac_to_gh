Indeed, that hasn't been done so far:

```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: P.<x> = UCF[]
sage: p = x**5-1
sage: p.roots()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: root finding for this polynomial not implemented
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>What is your code supposed to do!?

```
sage: x = polygen(UCF)
sage: (x**2 - 3).factor()
x^2 - 3
```
But there is a square root

```
sage: UCF(3).sqrt()
E(12)^7 - E(12)^11
sage: UCF(3).sqrt()**2
3
```
I propose to simply revert all of what this ticket did in #28659.

Note that the `sqrt` used above is implemented for integers only since this is more or less trivial. But it fails for general UCF elements. Implementing more is definitely welcome
- factorization of rational polynomials over UCF
- square root for any UCF element
(these are non-trivial tasks)

Please be more careful with your code submissions and reviews. Code discussion is very welcome on sage-devel and sage-nt.

I'm sorry for that, Vincent, and will be more careful in future! I didn't become aware, that there was a serious reason that this was not implemented.

On the other hand, I think there are reasons, that Sage should be able to find roots of unity over the UCF. At least the following two:

1) Code which needs a root of unity over an unspecified ring should not need an separate implementation for UCF.

2) Sage is not only a tool for experts, but satisfies educational requirements, as well. But, what I've displayed in the ticket-description would at least cause irritations.

My code can be easily improved (adding two lines), in order to be not vastly any more. I will explain this in the new ticket.
