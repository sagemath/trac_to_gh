Presumably this should work, since somebody implemented it on the right,

```
sage: from sage.modules.vector_space_morphism import VectorSpaceMorphism
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ,2)
sage: f = VectorSpaceMorphism(V.Hom(V), identity_matrix(QQ,2))
sage: f*(1/2)
Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
[1/2   0]
[  0 1/2]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
```

just not on the left:

```
sage: (1/2)*f
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Rational Field' and 'Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations) from Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field to Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field'
```
