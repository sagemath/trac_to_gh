findstat.org has now a proper api.  In this ticket we switch to this api, and create a hierarchy of classes that better models what findstat provides.

In particular, this allows search for maps, iterating over all statistics or maps with given domain, easier access to search for distributions, etc.

Restricted to the capabilities of the old interface, the usage remains the same.

We also fix all the failing doctest.

**Original ticket description**

Using `SageMath version 9.2.beta2, Release Date: 2020-06-26`, the command

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/databases/findstat.py
```

gives

```

<a id='comment:2'></a>Essentially the problem is (very very likely) that there is a new collection on findstat.org (skew partitions), which is not reflected in the sage interface (yet).

Very unfortunately, findstat.org itself has (technical) problems which I was unable to resolve so far.

On top of that, investing time into the old code is going to delay the deployment of the new and shiny and proper api for the website even further, although it is almost done (since an embarassingly long time).

One way to speed up the process would be to decide to drop support for the old way to access findstat completely.  This would mean that, that I would switch findstat.org and the sage interface to the new api simultaneously, and that old versions of sage could not use findstat anymore.  I doubt that this is a very good idea, but it is a possibility.

<a id='comment:3'></a>a brief update:

* I am now finished with implementing a proper api on the server side of FindStat, it is currently in testing - findstat.org itself is using this api since 31.12.2019.

* My next task is to rewrite the sage-findstat interface, I will use this as a testcase to check whether the api is well designed.  I intend to publish the api and the new interface at the same time.

In the meantime, the sage interface should be fully functional.

  Please open a ticket on trac!
  """

  Would it be possible to automatize this? Otherwise, every user will see this on startup and likely get confused.

* I would prefer a single entry point (maybe `FindStat` with `FindStat.find_statistic` and `FindStat.find_map`?). If I know `findstat` but not `findmap`, I might completely miss the latter? Also, using `FindStat?` would immediately give instructions how to proceed.

* (This is not for this ticket but for the backend:) Queries from the interface are not yet logged in the findstat log.

* `41: St001489oMp00081oMp00059 (quality [100, 100])` The term `quality` is not obviously explained. In the doc, it might be referred to as "a number which says how many values...". a proper definition of this quality might be helpful.

* The term `distribution` is not explained how to be used in the input section of `findstat`: it is twice referred to as "distribution must be None".

* It remains unclear (I think, to a new user) what "a new statistic" means. I would suggest to not show this as one of the "results" of a `DababaseQuery`. Instead, I would suggest to have this available as a method `submit_as_new_statistic`. 
  * This method fails if the input datum is not a statistic (but a distribution).
  * If there is no result, the user gets prompted a message that this method is available in case she wants to submit the data.

* The term `offset` is not exlained, is it?

* What about two methods `matching values` and `unmatched_values` ?
  * Each of these could consist of lists of pairs of the form `( ( elt1, elt2, elt3 ), val )`.

* Finally: Since the output might be long and confusing, I think it would be great if `FindStatMatchingStatistic` had a method `info` or `detailed_info` or alike which would in detail present this match:

Unfortunately, support of new collections cannot be made automatic.  However, a new collection appears possibly once a year, so it shouldn't be a big problem.  I cleaned the message a bit.

 > * I would prefer a single entry point (maybe `FindStat` with `FindStat.find_statistic` and `FindStat.find_map`?). If I know `findstat` but not `findmap`, I might completely miss the latter? Also, using `FindStat?` would immediately give instructions how to proceed.

No, I don't want to do this.  If you discover `findstat`, I am sure you will discover `findstat`, too.  Introducing a new layer introduces more typing with very little benefit - it is extremely unlikely that there will be a third item analogous to `findstat` and `findmap`.  To get the tutorial, `sage.databases.findstat?` suffices, as with all of sage.

The quality is explained in the tutorial, but I agree it should also be explained in `findstat?` and `findmap?`.  Patches welcome.

> * The term `distribution` is not explained how to be used in the input section of `findstat`: it is twice referred to as "distribution must be None".


Indeed, the documentation of `findstat` and `findmap` still needs to be improved.

> * It remains unclear (I think, to a new user) what "a new statistic" means. I would suggest to not show this as one of the "results" of a `DababaseQuery`. Instead, I would suggest to have this available as a method `submit_as_new_statistic`.

Done, with the exception of failing for "distributions", because it is not clear when to fail exactly.  I think it is better (and easier) to allow submission in case of doubt.

> * The term `offset` is not exlained, is it?


It is now in the tutorial, but should also be explained by `findstat?`

> * What about two methods `matching values` and `unmatched_values` ?
>   * Each of these could consist of lists of pairs of the form `( ( elt1, elt2, elt3 ), val )`.


That's non-trivial, and I'd therefore like not to do it now. 

> * Finally: Since the output might be long and confusing, I think it would be great if `FindStatMatchingStatistic` had a method `info` or `detailed_info` or alike which would in detail present this match:


done.

Here is a (very stupid) workaround - but you absolutely have to fix openssl support:

```
sage: from sage.databases.findstat import FINDSTAT_URL
sage: sage.databases.findstat.FINDSTAT_URL = 'http://www.findstat.org/'

Is there a more python3 way to import it? Maybe among:

Also pyflakes still says:

Is it really unused?
