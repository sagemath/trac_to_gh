Currently, for sparse graphs the backend keeps a copy of the reversed graph. This makes iterating over ingoing neighbors much faster.

However, `SparseGraph` itself does not have access to this. So e.g. when deleting vertices, this results in a massive slow down as it needs to delete incoming edges.

We initialize the sparse backend with the reversed structure and instead add the reversed structure directly to `SparseGraph`.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: edges = [(randint(0,1000), randint(0,1000)) for _ in range(100000)]
sage: save(edges, '/tmp/edges')
sage: D = DiGraph(multiedges=True, loops=True)
sage: %time D.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 80.1 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 80.1 ms
Wall time: 79.6 ms
sage: %time for i in range(100): D.delete_vertex(i)
CPU times: user 11.7 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 11.7 ms
Wall time: 11.5 ms
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: edges = load('/tmp/edges')
sage: D = DiGraph(multiedges=True, loops=True)
sage: %time D.add_edges(edges)
CPU times: user 69 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 69 ms
Wall time: 68.6 ms
sage: %time for i in range(100): D.delete_vertex(i)
CPU times: user 4.42 ms, sys: 16 µs, total: 4.43 ms
Wall time: 4.44 ms
```


We fix an issue in `subdivide_edges` that would have caused a doctest to fail with the new setup:

There is a doctest calling the method `subdivide_edges` with `self.edges()`. As one can see from the documenation from `EdgesView`, one should not modify the graph while iterating through `EdgesView`, because it updates itself. So the following test in `generic_graph.py` is wrong usage of `subdivide_edges` or `edges`:

```
sage: g.subdivide_edges(g.edges(), 1)
```

However, as it seems very natural to do this, we pass a tuple instead of `EdgesView` to the backend.

```
sage: G = DiGraph(2, data_structure='dense')
sage: G.add_edge(0,1)

This ticket also fixes this (the method `in_degree` in the CGraph backend assumes `_cg_rev` to be initialized).

Is it going in a good direction?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thank you for doing this, it's really needed.

With these changes, `_cg_rev` is no longer initialized, right ? If it's no longer needed, may be we can remove it, but we have to ensure that no-one is using it. Actually I fear that some users are using it for personal code. I see 2 solutions for that:
1. send a pool to sage-dev for complete removal
2. maintain an object build from `_cg` with appropriate pointers, and add a warning in the documentation.


## in `sparse_graph.pyx`:

```diff
-            for i from 0 <= i < self.active_vertices.size * self.hash_length:
+            for i in range(self.active_vertices.size * self.hash_length):
```

I think you can simplify tests to `NULL`

```diff
-                while temp[0] != NULL:
+                while temp[0]:
```


```diff
-        Lists the in-neighbors of a vertex as BTNodes
+        List the in-neighbors of a vertex as BTNodes
```

```diff
-        Builds the list of arcs into a vertex.
+        Build the list of arcs into a vertex.
```

```diff
-        Adds arc (u, v) to the graph with label l.
+        Add arc (u, v) to the graph with label l.
```

Better to use `True` and `False` instead of 0 and 1.

```diff
-        cdef int u_int = self.check_labelled_vertex(u, 0)
-        cdef int v_int = self.check_labelled_vertex(v, 0)
+        cdef int u_int = self.check_labelled_vertex(u, False)
+        cdef int v_int = self.check_labelled_vertex(v, False)
```


## in `c_graph.pyx` we can do some extra optimisations, like

in `verts`

```diff
-        cdef int i
-        return [i for i in range(<int>self.active_vertices.size)
-                if bitset_in(self.active_vertices, i)]
+       return bitset_list(self.active_vertices)
```

in `iterator_verts`

```diff
-            for i in range(self._cg.active_vertices.size):
-                if (bitset_in(self._cg.active_vertices, i)
-                    and i not in self.vertex_labels
-                    and i not in self.vertex_ints):
-                        yield i
+            i = bitset_first(self._cg.active_vertices)
+            while i >= 0:
+                if (i not in self.vertex_labels
+                    and i not in self.vertex_ints):
+                        yield i
+                i = bitset_next(self._cg.active_vertices, i + 1)
```

Fixing this makes a mistake apparent: There is a doctest in `generic_graph.py` that subdivides all edges of a graph by using `self.edges()`. However, one should not iterate over an `EdgesView` object while modifying the graph. I have modified the method `subdivide_edges` to generate a tuple from `EdgesView`.

* method `del_arc_unsafe` returns nothing

* in method `del_arc_label_unsafe`, can't we do this (not sure if it's better or not):

```diff
-        cdef int error = self._del_arc_label_unsafe(u, v, l, self.vertices)
-        if error:
-            return 1 # indicate an error
+        if self._del_arc_label_unsafe(u, v, l, self.vertices):
+            return 1 # indicate an error
```

* Thanks for correcting `subdivise_edges`.

I confirm that vertex deletion is much faster now.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>There are tons of compilation warnings, as we include all of `bitset.pxi`, which is annoying, but of course not serious.\n\nThe compilation warning about wrong casting of `self._cg` is a bit tricky. I think I took care of it now. The problem is that `SparseGraphBackend` casts the `SparseGraph` to a `CGraph` in order to assign it to `self._cg`, which is declared to be a `CGraph`. This is later on casted back into a `SpareGraph`, which of course produces a warning.\n\nMy approach now: Remove the attribute `_cg` from `CGraphBackend` and add it to the inherited backends with the proper declaration.

<a id='comment:13'></a>There are tons of compilation warnings, as we include all of `bitset.pxi`, which is annoying, but of course not serious.

The compilation warning about wrong casting of `self._cg` is a bit tricky. I think I took care of it now. The problem is that `SparseGraphBackend` casts the `SparseGraph` to a `CGraph` in order to assign it to `self._cg`, which is declared to be a `CGraph`. This is later on casted back into a `SpareGraph`, which of course produces a warning.

My approach now: Remove the attribute `_cg` from `CGraphBackend` and add it to the inherited backends with the proper declaration. Add an inline method `cg`, which returns `_cg` casted to a `CGraph`. This is cleaner, I think.

<a id='comment:25'></a>overall, it's a very nice improvement. I have only a few suggestions.

**`sparse_graph.pyx`**
-  instead of checking `self.vertices != self.vertices_rev`, we could store a boolean value `self._directed` and have a method `self.is_directed())`.

- instead of `<size_t>-1`, don't we have a constant equal to the max value ? This is something we should do in several places in the code. Could be done in dedicated tickets

- in `out_neighbors_unsafe` and `in_neighbors_unsafe`, remove `cdef list l = []`, not used


- I know that the documentation of cdef methods is not displayed, but it would be cleaner to follow the same standard than in the other parts of the code. For instance

```diff
        INPUT:
-            u, v -- non-negative integers
+
+            - ``u, v`` -- non-negative integers
```
  Of course, we can do that in a future ticket. Not a priority here


- methods `out_arcs_unsafe` and `in_arcs_unsafe` return lists. Why not changing to an iterator ? If I'm not mistaken, these methods are only used in for loops.

- same for method `all_arcs` which is used in a for loop and in some doctests where we could use `list(...)`.

This is being cythonized into `((size_t)-1L)` and I hope the compiler takes care of it from there. It's maybe not so nice codewise, but I don't think it is any loss.

The last two I would leave for future tickets. But you are right. We really iterate over a structure that is already there (either over a bitset or a tree). So there is no use in wasting resources for creating this list.
