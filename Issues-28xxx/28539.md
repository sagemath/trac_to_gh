This ticket proposes micro optimizations for small permutation
groups. The rationale is to handle the situation where we have
billions of combinatorial objects and need to run through their
automorphism groups most of which are trivial or let's say have
size at most 100. An even more concrete application is given by
[admcycles MR 14](https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/merge_requests/14)
where there is an attempt to use graph automorphisms from Sage
instead of a handmade implementation. This turns out to result
in a major slowdown! For example

```
sage: from admcycles.admcycles import Hyperell
sage: %time H = Hyperell(3)
```
takes 13.5 s on master but with MR 14 takes 17.4 s.

The profiling points to

- the constructor `__init__` of `PermutationGroupElement`:
  see #28652
- the `subgroup` method of `PermutationGroupElement`
- the product `p1 * p2` when `p1` is a symmetric group element
  and `p2` is a permutation group on the same domain:
  see #28652 (and also the bug #28544)
- `__iter__` for `PermutationGroupElement` (that currently
  involves computing a strong generating scheme):
  see #28652 and #28653

The optimizations proposed in this ticket noticeably speed up
the `Hyperell(3)` computation mentioned above: from 17.4 s with
the previous Sage implementation or 13.5 s with admcycle's
previous handmade implementation, the timing goes down to 9 s.

Depends on #28544

Depends on #28652

Depends on #28653

I agree with Frédéric that adding a whole bunch of `# py2` and `# py3` tags is not a good solution. I am assuming this comes from this change:

```diff
-        return self.iteration(algorithm="SGS")
+        if len(self._gens) == 1:
+            return self._iteration_monogen()
+        elif self.cardinality() <= 100:
+            return self.iteration(algorithm="BFS")
+        else:
+            return self.iteration(algorithm="SGS")
```
and the `BFS` option calls `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, which has consistency problems on Python3 IIRC. So we have to solve that bigger problem first.

I have some other comments:

I don't see the point of going to cycles just to convert back here:

```
return grp.element_class(self.to_cycles(singletons=False), grp, check=False)
```
I know this was already done, but it seems useless as the `PermutationGroupElement` stores things internally as a list in essentially the same way.

I would probably Cythonize `from_cycles`.

Is there a reason why `_set_identity` and `_set_list_images` are `cpdef` and not just `cdef` (which is faster when being called by C code)? By being `cpdef`, they also need doctests.

+[admcycles MR 14](https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/merge_requests/14)
+where there is an attempt to use graph automorphisms from Sage
+instead of a handmade implementation. This turns out to result
+in a major slowdown! For example
 
 ```
 sage: from admcycles.admcycles import Hyperell
 sage: %time H = Hyperell(3)
 ```
-takes 13.5 sec on master but with MR 14 takes 17.4 sec.
+takes 13.5 s on master but with MR 14 takes 17.4 s.
 
 The profiling points to
-- the constructor `__init__` of `PermutationGroupElement`: see #28652
-- the `.subgroup` method of `PermutationGroupElement`
-- the product `p1 * p2` when `p1` is a symmetric group element and `p2` is a permutation group on the same domain: see #28652 (and also the bug #28544)
-- `__iter__` for `PermutationGroupElement` (that currently involves computing a strong generating scheme): see #28652 and #28653
 
-Implementing these optimizations lower the `Hyperell(3)` computation mentioned above from 17.4 sec to 9 sec.
