The problem that autotools kick in while building autoconf'ed packages on HPC clusters and in similar unusual environments persists (there are old tickets dealing with it too, e.g. #12501), see e.g. this sage-devel [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/lISFUY_eiA4/Cp2W8jA6BAAJ).

According to [automake docs (AM_MAINTAINER_MODE)](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/maintainer_002dmode.html), configuring with `--disable-maintainer-mode` is the way to go if this macro is used.
It is e.g. the case for `gf2x`, its configure.ac has
`configure.ac:AM_MAINTAINER_MODE([enable])` in.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

actually, `--disable-maintainer-mode` may be added unconditionally to an autoconf-produced `./configure`, as it would merely produce a warning if it's not understood.

But we also have hand-written `./configure`'s
that don't respect this rule, e.g. `flint`'s one errors out on any unrecognised option.

So one can do the following; check that

```
./configure --disable-foobarfoofoo --enable-option-checking=fatal 2>&1  | grep ^Usage
```
is empty, and in this case add `--disable-maintainer-mode` to the parameters of ./configure. Otherwise do not add it.

---

We can as well just try with `--disable-maintainer-mode` first, and if it fails (and it would fail quickly with non-conformant ./configure), try without it.

---
I'd go with the latter, what do you think?

`--disable-dependency-tracking` speeds up "1-time" builds, by not doing extra chasing of what needs to be rebuilt.
As our `spkg-install` calls are exactly this, "1-time" builds, then why not?
