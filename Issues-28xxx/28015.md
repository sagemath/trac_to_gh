Hello,

trying to package Sage for Guix, I am stumbling over the lcalc package, which needs patches to even compile with a modern C++ compiler and is unmaintained with not even the upstream source available apart from places where it is mirrored. This will need a considerable time to wade through, for probably not much gain.

As some possible solutions, I would suggest the following (in decreasing order of preference):
- Drop lcalc and replace it by other libraries. For instance, the analytic rank of elliptic curves is already computed by several other packages. PARI has gained L-function capabilities in version 2.9, with new functionality in version 2.11, so I think it makes sense to rely on the maintained PARI implementation rather than on a defunct package. (Note also bug #24823 for using ARB.)
- Make the package optional (which may be difficult or impossible, since it is cythonised).
- Host the source somewhere with all patches applied to make it easily compilable; or even autotoolise it like Dima did with cliquer.

Hi Andreas,

Your proposal is nothing new. And yes lcalc needs lots of patches and Dima has created a repo somewhere for it already but for some reason that bit was stopped.
