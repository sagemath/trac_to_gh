Hello,

trying to package Sage for Guix, I am stumbling over the lcalc package, which needs patches to even compile with a modern C++ compiler and is unmaintained with not even the upstream source available apart from places where it is mirrored. This will need a considerable time to wade through, for probably not much gain.

As some possible solutions, I would suggest the following (in decreasing order of preference):
- Drop lcalc and replace it by other libraries. For instance, the analytic rank of elliptic curves is already computed by several other packages. PARI has gained L-function capabilities in version 2.9, with new functionality in version 2.11, so I think it makes sense to rely on the maintained PARI implementation rather than on a defunct package. (Note also bug #24823 for using ARB.)
- Make the package optional (which may be difficult or impossible, since it is cythonised).
- Host the source somewhere with all patches applied to make it easily compilable; or even autotoolise it like Dima did with cliquer.

Hi Andreas,

Your proposal is nothing new. And yes lcalc needs lots of patches and Dima has created a repo somewhere for it already but for some reason that bit was stopped. Replacing lcacl by pari has been proposed before and Jeroen work on it in another ticket. According to him, pari is slower so far. I'll dig the relevant tickets later.

At least my attempt is on #24532 (when I realized quickly that it wouldn't work). I don't know if anybody else has looked at this.
