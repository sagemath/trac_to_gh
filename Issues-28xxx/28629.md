The SR enforcement in `sage/manifolds/differentiable/automorphismfield.py` is only a temporary solution since it uses only one chart. Using the common inversion algorithm would lead into high computation times since division free algorithms are used. An unmathematical solution would be adding `is_field()` to `sage/manifolds/scalarfield_algebra.py` returning `True` since sophisticated inversion algorithms are used then.

Scalar fields behave in a similar way to symbolic ring elements: There is a `_div_` given and "most" elements are invertible. Therefore it would be great to have the possibility to force and at least try the algorithm of matrix inversion for fields on matrices having this kind of elements (at least for internal use).
