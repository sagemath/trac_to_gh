The following now seems to work correctly (after #26932)

```
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ, [2] * 46)
sage: m._det_linbox()
70368744177664
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ, [3] * 100)
sage: m._det_linbox()
515377520732011331036461129765621272702107522001
```
This ticket stands for removing the `#not tested` directive and also put the appropriate `sig_on`/`sig_off` around linbox calls.


Note however, linbox is not doing great

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 100, 100, sparse=True)
sage: m = M.random_element(density=0.1)
sage: %timeit m.__copy__().det()
100 loops, best of 5: 8.45 ms per loop
sage: %timeit m._det_linbox()
10 loops, best of 5: 43.4 ms per loop
```
And it gets worse as the dimension increases

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 500, 500, sparse=True)
sage: m = M.random_element(density=0.1)
sage: %time d = m.__copy__().det()
CPU times: user 796 ms, sys: 3 Âµs, total: 796 ms
Wall time: 795 ms
sage: %time m._det_linbox()
CPU times: user 25.2 s, sys: 44 ms, total: 25.3 s
Wall time: 25.3 s
```
