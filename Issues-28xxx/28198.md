I agree with your improvement. I did a small correction to avoid this issue

sage: a = b = set()
sage: a.add(1)

- I don't like so much the duplication in the `BipartiteGraph.__init__`.
- The `sets_from_colors` would be more natural if it would return `ans` instead of `ans.values()`. That is it would transform a dictionary `k -> v` in `v -> {keys with that values}`.

Is that ok if I try something to fix these.
