The optional precision arguments for Tate's elliptic curves are incorrectly implemented. For many functions, increasing the precision does not increase the precision of the output.

Here an example of what was wrong

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("126a5")
sage: Eq = E.tate_curve(2)
sage: R = Qp(2,30)
sage: u = R(2019)
sage: Eq.parametrisation_onto_original_curve(u, prec=30)
(2^-2 + 2^-1 + 1 + 2 + 2^3 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^15 + O(2^18) : 2^-3 + 2^-2 + 2^-1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^9 + 2^11 + 2^14 + 2^15 + O(2^16) : 1 + O(2^30))
```

The precision drops to 20. Now fixed returns:

```
(2^-2 + 2^-1 + 1 + 2 + 2^3 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^15 + 2^18 + 2^19 + 2^20 + 2^21 + 2^26 + O(2^28) : 2^-3 + 2^-2 + 2^-1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^9 + 2^11 + 2^14 + 2^15 + 2^19 + 2^20 + 2^23 + 2^24 + 2^25 + O(2^26) : 1 + O(2^30))
```

I'm sorry, but can't fully test this at the moment, so I can't give you examples, but 
I spotted a couple of issues (not introduced by you), but propagate through the rest:

1- One is always hitting an `AttributeError` in the `try` block in `def parameter`, as it should be calling `precision_absolute`. Also, the `try` block is a bit sad, as it should be just triggered by `__init__`. Perhaps a `getattr(self, '_q', None)` would make more sense.

2- Shouldn't we be checking for `precision_relative`? Given that we are always working with relative precision.

3- Shouldn't parameter return a value with the right precision?
If not, we might need to work more and get results with more precision than expected. 

4- Similar to the previous item, we should consider replacing `R = qE.parent()` by `R = Qp(self._p, prec=prec)` in `def curve`.

You may be right that there are more things that should be improved in that file. The purpose of this ticket is to correct a bug: I can increase the precision of the output by increasing the parameter prec. That was broken.

My proposal is that this is done on this ticket. Then we can open a further ticket to improve things.

In particular, I can get rid of try blocks (this is early sage when there were try blocks everywhere). 
We could also think about getting provable correct precisions out. Honestly, I have little interest in doing so, but I would be willing to go through the file and make the necessary changes. But I doubt that anyone uses the output in that way. We should at least, give a warning that it is not provable relative/absolute precision.

If we want to do everything on this ticket, it is likely to drag for months and may get abandoned when this simple quick fix would have improved sage.
