Some experiments:

* html-minifier shrinks HTML content to 80%-90%
* converting SVG that contain base64 PNGs to PNG and using pngquant shrinks 3D plots to 25%
* zipping regular SVGs shrinks them to about 30% but browsers mostly refuse to display svgz.
* imagemin with mozjpeg cuts most JPEG sizes in half.

Now, I don't want to turn all of these tools into SPKGs but they could be installed with yarn easily.
