Using `len(AbelianGroup(...).subgroups())` to find the number of subgroups of an abelian group is inefficient. Using the function `sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` is much faster. This also allows to find the number of subgroups of a given order more efficiently. For example:

```python
sage: G = AbelianGroup([10,15,25,12])
sage: %time len(G.subgroups())
CPU times: user 33.4 s, sys: 3.88 s, total: 37.3 s
Wall time: 47.5 s
5760
sage: %time G.number_of_subgroups()
CPU times: user 9.39 ms, sys: 160 µs, total: 9.55 ms
Wall time: 8.74 ms
5760
sage: %time G.number_of_subgroups(order=50)
CPU times: user 4.34 ms, sys: 39 µs, total: 4.38 ms
Wall time: 3.77 ms
168
```

The commit also fix few ReST typos in the docs of the module.

<a id='comment:4'></a>A few little details in addition to Frédéric's comment:

Remove the period at the end here:

```
        - ``order`` -- (default: ``None``) find the number of subgroups of this
          order; if ``None``, this defaults to counting all subgroups.
```

Typo: `infinitly` -> `infinitely`

This is faster:

```diff
             for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
-                p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
-                p_exps = Partition(p_exps)
-                orders_by_prime[p] = range(p_exps.size() + 1)
+                orders_by_prime[p] = range(sum(p_exps) + 1)
```
there is no need to create the partition just to get its size.

I don't understand what this code does:

```python
            for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
                p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
                p_exps = Partition(p_exps)
                orders_by_prime[p] = [order_exps[p]]
```
`p_exps` is never used to do any computation. Shouldn't you just remove that part?

I am guessing you are meaning to modify in place the `p_exps`, which the call to `sort` does, but I am pretty sure the `Partition` call does not. In either case, this should be done in the loop you actually use it:

```diff
         for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
             p_result = Integer(0)
+            p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
             for i in orders_by_prime[p]:
                 for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps):
                     p_result += q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
             result *= p_result
         return result
```

Thanks, fixed.

For the other things, I think I wanted to use the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), thinking that `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` needs to an integer partition for input. Now I removed even importing `Partition` and followed your suggestions.

I think my changes might have increased the types of input it could take, but is not so important.

One last thing I noticed (which should result in a speedup):

```diff
-            p_result = Integer(0)
             p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
-            for i in subgroups_orders_by_prime[p]:
-                for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps):
-                    p_result += q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
-            result *= p_result
+            result *= sum(q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
+                          for i in subgroups_orders_by_prime[p]
+                          for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps))
```
It would be even faster if you avoided the transient `Partition` objects and just passed a list, but that would mean modifying `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group`, possibly for not much gain. (Definitely a separate ticket.)
