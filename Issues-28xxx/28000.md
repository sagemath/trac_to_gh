Python 3 support (#15530) was completed for Sage 9.0 (thanks in particular to the leadership of Frédéric Chapoton). Official support for Python 2.7 by the CPython core developers is ending January 1, 2020.

To enable major package upgrades and other changes that require Python 3.x (#29141), 
this ticket removes Python 2 support in Sage for Sage 9.2.

Also, this ticket can be set as a dependency for other tickets that depend on the
removal of Python 2 support. Many dependency upgrades will depend on that.

Might it make sense to migrate the whole Jupyter part to Python3-only versions
before completely removing Python 3 support? Even when building Sage for
Python 2, we ship Python 3 too anyway.

Here's some of my progress on this so far: Probably one of the biggest, most pervasive steps, being complete removal of dependency on `six`.

Of course, this step is optional--we can keep using `six` while otherwise dropping support for Python 2.  But this makes it quite explicit.

It's pretty hard to avoid making a patch bomb of this.  It's not all bad though--I started this months ago, and then once I got it finished I rebased on current develop and only had about a dozen minor merge conflicts.

Other tasks:

- #28426: with a Python 3 build, do not build Python 2.
- remove some packages which are only necessary with Python 2: `typing` (#28499) is the only one I know of currently, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were others.
