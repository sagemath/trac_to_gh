Python 3 support (#15530) was completed for Sage 9.0 (thanks in particular to the leadership of Frédéric Chapoton). Official support for Python 2.7 by the CPython core developers is ending January 1, 2020.

To enable major package upgrades and other changes that require Python 3.x (#29141), 
this ticket removes Python 2 support in Sage for Sage 9.2.

Go through and remove all hacks related to supporting Python 2.  It will be interesting to see how big a change it takes even now.  It's rather early to go through and do that in earnest, but it would be fun to just try and see what it takes.

Also, this ticket can be set as a dependency for other tickets that depend on the
removal of Python 2 support. Many dependency upgrades will depend on that.

Might it make sense to migrate the whole Jupyter part to Python3-only versions
before completely removing Python 3 support? Even when building Sage for
Python 2, we ship Python 3 too anyway.

Here's some of my progress on this so far: Probably one of the biggest, most pervasive steps, being complete removal of dependency on `six`.

Of course, this step is optional--we can keep using `six` while otherwise dropping support for Python 2.  But this makes it quite explicit.

Other tasks:

- remove or revise the doctests labeled `# py2`. Ideally, all such tests should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, some should just be removed, but perhaps some should be modified to work with Python 3.
- #28426: with a Python 3 build, do not build Python 2.
- remove some packages which are only necessary with Python 2: `typing` (#28499) is the only one I know of currently, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were others.
- remove the legacy Sage notebook — at least, I don't think it works with Python 3 now, and I don't think anyone is working on it. This means we should deprecate it ASAP. (#25837)
