#27865 has refactored the class `GraphicsArray`, making it a subclass of `MultiGraphics`, and has moved its definition from  `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` to `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`. As pointed out in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/eTl4DHcwnOo/uQSOtstWAwAJ, this has broken Sage's API: the import via

```
from sage.plot.graphics import GraphicsArray
```
does not longer work. This ticket makes it work again, but with the following deprecation notice: 

```
DeprecationWarning: GraphicsArray must be imported from sage.plot.multigraphics 
and no longer from sage.plot.graphics.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28675 for details.
```
A possible shortcoming of the approach adopted here is that the deprecation message appears only at the first use of `GraphicsArray`, not during the `import` itself. Actually, I don't know if it is possible to generate a deprecation warning during some import.
