A number of optional packages fail to build on OS X with a Python 3 version of Sage, as discussed [on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ukJgMweHszU/x2tA9XEPEQAJ). Optional packages should build on all platforms, so since these fail, we demote them to experimental.

In more detail:

- awali, buckygen, cbc, gambit demoted from optional to experimental
- brian, guppy, mercurial mpi4py, trac are deleted: they were type `pip` before, but building fails with Python 3. Users can still use `./sage --pip install PKG` with them, as with any other `pip` package.
- pyx: changed from `optional` to `pip`: this way the most recent version, which is Python 3-compatible, is used, rather than Sage's somewhat outdated version.

No one claimed that it had to do with Python 3. Once it fails to build on a supported platform, I really think it should be demoted to experimental. You can reinstate it to optional at #28688 if you verify that it builds on all supported platforms.
