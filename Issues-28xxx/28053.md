This function returns the length of a formula (parentheses and spaces are ignored). 
Useful for proofs by induction on the length of a propositional formula.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: len(f)
1
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: len(g)
3
```


**Keywords:** logic, symbolics, propositional formula

This patch defines the `__len__()` attribute of a Boolean formula to be the length of the formula. So `len(f)` is the length of the formula `f`. This is the number of operators plus the number of variables (counting multiplicity). Parentheses and spaces in the formula are ignored.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: len(f)
1
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: len(g)
3
```
