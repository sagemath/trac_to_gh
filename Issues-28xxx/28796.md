Someone with the user name `dhagrow` uploaded a package `sage`, version 0.0.0, to PyPI in 2018. The package provides no description nor contact information. This is harmless, but could cause confusion. 

Python packages may want to declare `sage` as a dependency in their `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` - as this is the name of the Python package for the Sage library defined in `SAGEROOT/src/setup.py`.

The package itself is also empty.  It just contains a `sage/__init__.py` containing `__version__ = '0.0.0'`.

[PEP 541](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/) includes procedures and conditions for requesting an ownership transfer on PyPI.
