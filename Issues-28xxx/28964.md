This ticket fixes several problems related to the conversion of derivatives to and from sympy:

- the derivative arguments were permuted when converting to sympy (comment:7)
- the conversion from Sage to sympy did not account for the case of variables with multiple occurences (comment:1)
- the first argument of the derivative was skipped when converting from sympy (comment:6)
- sympy returns arguments of type `sympy.core.containers.Tuple` which was not handled
- Sage's derivative does not accept tuples, so the arguments must be flattened
- sympy's integer type is converted to Sage's rational type, but should be converted to Sage's integer type

(Original description below.)

Minimal case of a problem reported on [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49384/simple-integration-problem/).

```
sage: reset()
sage: var("x,t")
(x, t)
sage: f=function("f") ## Note : no formal arguments
sage: diff(f(x,t),x)
diff(f(x, t), x)
sage: diff(f(x,t),x).integrate(x)
f(x, t)
```

As expected. But :

```
sage: diff(f(x,t),x).integrate(t)
f(x, t)
```

No, no, no. And no.

Slightly better:

```
sage: reset()
sage: var("x,t")
(x, t)
sage: f=function("f")(x,t)  ## Note : specified formal arguments.
sage: diff(f(x,t),x)
diff(f(t, x), x)
sage: diff(f(x,t),x).integrate(x)
f(t, x)
sage: diff(f(x,t),x).integrate(t)

No again. But at least, this is an explicit error, not a silently accepted wrong result.

The problem seems to point to handling formal arguments of undefined functions. I do not (yet) understand this code...

IMHO, at least the first case is critical (possibly blocker), because it silently returns a wrong result.

Note that the handling of *defined* functions *seems* to be correct. For example:

```
sage: sin(t*x).diff(x)
t*cos(t*x)
sage: sin(t*x).diff(x).integrate(x)
sin(t*x)
sage: sin(t*x).diff(x).integrate(t)
(t*x*sin(t*x) + cos(t*x))/x^2
```

Weird. Round-tripping to maxima seems to do the right thing, so that's not where the problem seems to lie:

```
sage: diff(f(x,t),x)._maxima_().integrate(t)._sage_()
integrate(diff(f(x, t), x), t)
```
If you make the variable combinations a little more complicated:

```
sage: diff(f(x,x,t),x).integrate(t)
ValueError: No differentiation variable specified.
sage: diff(f(x,x,t),t).integrate(x)
ValueError: 
Since there is more than one variable in the expression, the
variable(s) of differentiation must be supplied to differentiate f(x,
x, t)
```
These are Pynac errors. So I suspect that there is a differentiation that doesn't have its variable specified, and that with only two variables around (one for the integration!) it ends up choosing that variable. So my guess is either Pynac itself or the way we interface with it.

The same problem seems to arise the other way around as well:

```
sage: integrate(f(x,t),x).diff(t)
f(x, t)
```

we can make that cause an error by fiddling with some more variables and then we see that the error traces back in something being called from `_sympysage_integral()`, so I think this error was introduced relatively recently, when sympy was added as an integrator by default.

According to a comment posted around Jan 7, 2020 07:00 by dsejas in the original ask.sagemath question, the problem might have been introduced between 8.8 and 8.9.

It should be possible to `git bisect` this range to pinpoint the commit. I don't have the necessary resources on hand...

Translation of derivatives to sympy is definitely wonky:

```
sage: f=function('f')
sage: F=f(x,y,t).diff(t)
sage: F
diff(f(x, y, t), t)
sage: F._sympy_()
Derivative(f(x, y, t), y)
sage: F=f(x,x,t).diff(t)
sage: F._sympy_()
ValueError: 
Since there is more than one variable in the expression, the
variable(s) of differentiation must be supplied to differentiate f(x,
x, t)
```

There are typos in `sage/interfaces/sympy.py`:

```
def _sympysage_derivative(self):
    """
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sympy import Derivative
        sage: f = function('f')
        sage: sympy_diff = Derivative(f(x)._sympy_(), x._sympy_())
        sage: assert diff(f(x),x)._sympy_() == sympy_diff
        sage: assert diff(f(x),x) == sympy_diff._sage_()
    """
    from sage.calculus.functional import derivative
    f = self.args[0]._sage_()
    args = [[a._sage_() for a in arg] if isinstance(arg,tuple) else arg._sage_() for arg in self.args[2:]]
    return derivative(f, *args)
```
I'm pretty sure the second-last line should be iterating over `self.args[1:]`, but changing that doesn't actually seem to fix the problem.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
The patches in [comment:6](#comment%3A6) and [comment:7](#comment%3A7) almost fix the problem, but there were a few more issues in the conversion of derivatives between sympy and Sage. These are now fixed by this branch.

Most notably, sympy's arguments are encoded as `sympy.core.containers.Tuple` which was missed in a typecheck `isinstance(arg, tuple)`, and Sage's derivative does not accept tuples as arguments, so they need to be flattened.

Moreover, the conversion from Sage to sympy was very broken and has been rewritten completely, especially to account for the case of variables with multiple occurences as in [comment:1](#comment%3A1).

As far as I can see, all the test cases mentioned on this ticket work correctly now.

You are right. That was not a good solution. It turns out the problem is that elements of type `sympy.core.numbers.Integer` (a subtype of `sympy.core.numbers.Rational`) are converted to Sage's `Rational`. For example, this causes problems here:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: sympy.sympify('Derivative(f(x, t), x, x)')
Derivative(f(x, t), (x, 2))
sage: _._sage_()            # the 2 is converted to Rational here
...
```

I have just fixed this by implementing the missing conversion routine for integers. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I will squash the commits if you prefer.
