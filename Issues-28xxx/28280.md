This ticket gathers tickets related to the `CombinatorialPolyhedron' class.

The goal is to make this class consistent with the base class `Polyhedron_base`.

- #28603: `edge_graph` -> `vertex_graph`.
- #28604: `ridge_graph` -> `facet_graph`.
- #28605: Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.
  This is motivated by #10777.
- #28606: `unbounded(self)` -> `is_bounded(self)`.
- #28607: Make `f_vector` a vector.
- #28613: Replace `V` and `H` by more meaningful attributes/methods.
- #28614: `length_*` -> `n_*`.
- #28616: Replace `Vrepr()` and `Hrepr` by more consistent methods in `CombinatorialFace`.
- #28608: `repr` -> `rep` when abbreviating.
- #28757: Remove empty folder
- #29110: Make `dim` and alias for `dimension` in combinatorial polyhedron
- #29242: CombinatorialPolyhedron: `bit_repr_` -> `bit_rep_` 

Some of the tickets also take care of minor bug fixes or typos.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Some attributes like `bitrep_vertices` might have been an unfortunate choice:

As they are accessed by other classes, I'm forced to compute e.g. `bitrep_vertices` on initialization. If `CombinatorialPolyhedron` was ever to be a parent of `Polyhedron_base` (see #10777), this would force a polyhedron to compute the incidence matrix right away.

From my understanding, the decorator ``@`lazy_attribute` is not available for extension types directly. I'm thinking of changing those attributes to methods, such that there is a method `bitrep_facets` and an attribute `_bitrep_facets`. This way one can later change this to be lazily evaluated.

Any thoughts?

Does either one work with `cdef`?

Here, I want to give a small example of what I want to do:

```
sage: cython('''
....: cdef class BaseClass:
....:     cdef public int number
....: 
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.number = 2
....: ''')
sage: class NewClass(BaseClass):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         pass
....:     
sage: example = NewClass()
sage: example.number
0
```

I'm trying to somehow make `number` be a lazy attribute. The only solution I came up with, is to replace it by a method. Is there another way?


The background is that `CombinatorialPolyhedron` does require `Polyhedron` to compute the incidence matrix for correct initialization. If `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is to be a base class of `Polyhedron_base` at some point (#10777), it needs to be lazily initialized.

This ticket is huge, but almost all changes are trivial. Sorry, but that's what happens, when you change some names.
>

In `Polyhedron` there is `Vrepresentation` and `Vrep-generator`. So in a way, both things are used.

Now for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` there is only `Vrepresentation` in the namespace. `_Vrep` is an internal cython variable, while `Vrep` is the cython method that accesses `_Vrep`. I tried to use `cpdef` for both of them, but that didn't work (`closures inside cpdef functions not yet supported`, seems to be connected with `smallInteger`). So as long as it is that way, I would propse leaving the python method named `Vrepresentation` and the cython method `Vrepr`. But I'm open for different suggestions.

Now with `CombinatorialFace` things are a bit different. At the moment there is `Vrep`, `Hrep`, `n_Vrepresentation` and `n_Hrepresentation` (not consistent, I just noticed). `Vrep` allows giving both the indices and the names of the Vrepresentation. So in a way it combines `ambient_Vrepresentation` and `ambient_V_indices` of `PolyhedronFace`. What do you suggest?

One option would be the following for `CombinatorialFace`:
- `Vrep` -> `ambient_Vrep`
- make `ambient_Vrepresentation` an alias for `ambient_Vrep(names=True)`
- make `ambient_V_indices` an alias for `ambient_V_indices(names=False)`
- `n_Vrepresentation` -> `n_ambient_Vreprentation`
- same for `Hrep`
Unfortunatly, those changes are going to make the ticket even larger.

What do you think? If I have a clear idea what to do, I think I can make the remaining changes tonight.

I was just making sure. Let's try to make it happen.

`V_rep` is shortened because `_generator` appears after. So I would vote for completing the name to `Vrepresentation`.

Got it! Looks good.

Ok. I see. I would do `Vrep` to `Vrepresentation`. Then, if `CombinatorialFace` has a different behavior than the `PolyhedronFace` I believe it is fine.

> One option would be the following for `CombinatorialFace`:

It seems like making the current `Vrep` private and have `ambient_Vrepresentation` (with the whole word) call this private function `Vrep(names=True)` and likewise for `ambient_V_indices` be more reasonable.

Why have 3 functions when we can have 2? Especially, the 2 functions behave as they do in `PolyhedronFace`... so I do not see the need to provide `Vrep` in the namespace.

I will. It's just one of those things that where perfectly clear to me, so I do didn't comment.

One more thing: Lots of changes are due to the changes of abbreciations `Vrepr` -> `Vrep` etc. I noticed you seem to at least use both. I could undo this change and this might make the ticket shorter.

+Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.
 
+This is motivated by #10777.
+
+While at it, we will change some names of methods for consistency:
+
+We make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron_base`, most importantly:
+- `edge_graph` -> `vertex_graph`,
+- `ridge_graph` -> `facet_graph`,
+- `unbounded(self)` -> `is_bounded(self)`,
+- `length_Hrep` -> `n_Hrepresentation`,
+- `length_Hrep` -> `n_Hrepresentation`.
+
+For `CombinatorialFace` we do the following changes:
+- `face.Vrep(True)` -> `face.ambient_Vrepresentation()`, `face.Vrep(False)` -> `face.ambient_V_indices()`,
+- `n_Vrepresentation` -> `n_ambient_Vrepresentation`,
+- the above applied to `Hrep`.
+
+We also delete `.cc` in the module name of `bit_vector_operations`. The `.cc` lead to an empty folder in the source directory. Without this folder does not reappear.
+
+In addition we do some minor bug fixing and some improvement in the documentation.
