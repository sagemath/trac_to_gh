Fix the following *incorrect results*, and some related ones, either by returning a correct result or by raising an error instead.

```
sage: b = RBF(3/2, 1e-10)
sage: gamma(b, 1)
[0.5072822338117733 +/- 1.35e-17]
sage: gamma(CBF(b), 1)
[0.50728223381177 +/- 6.57e-15] + [3.505711e-11 +/- 2.19e-18]*I
sage: hurwitz_zeta(b, b)
[1.948110822808643 +/- 2.28e-16]
sage: hurwitz_zeta(1/2, b)
[-2.019112205794726 +/- 5.00e-16]
sage: airy_ai(b)
[0.07174949700810541 +/- 4.54e-18]

sage: iv = RIF(1, 1.0001)
sage: airy_ai(iv)
0.13528445910993159?
sage: airy_ai(CIF(iv))
0.13528445910993159?

sage: CBF(RBF(airy_ai(1))).overlaps(ComplexBallField(100).one().airy_ai())
False
sage: CBF(airy_ai(1)).overlaps(ComplexBallField(100).one().airy_ai())
False
sage: RBF(zetaderiv(1, 3/2)).overlaps(RealBallField(100)(3/2).zetaderiv(1))
False
sage: CBF(zetaderiv(1, 3/2)).overlaps(ComplexBallField(100)(3/2).zetaderiv(1))
False
```

Remarks:

* The cases where we now raise an error could be improved later by implementing/interfacing actual interval implementations of the relevant functions and/or adding general fallbacks mechanisms to evaluate functions on elements of RIF/CIF/RBF (and even RR, CC) based on the implementations available for CBF.

* This is little more than a band-aid solution, because much of the symbolic expression/function code manifestly follows the philosophy that a slightly wrong result is better than no result at all. (And some of the issues are in Pynac, not in Sage.)

* Nevertheless, this ticket has accumulated a number of small fixes that make them significantly less buggy...

If `nan` is what it is supposed to be for real balls then this should still be tested. Similarly with `sqrt(RBF(-2))`, `log(RBF(-2))`, etc. Though many functions perform base extension silently

```
sage: sqrt(-2.0)
1.41421356237310*I
sage: log(-2.0)
0.693147180559945 + 3.14159265358979*I
```
Why `RBF` should be different?
