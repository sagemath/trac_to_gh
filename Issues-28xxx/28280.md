This ticket gathers tickets related to the `CombinatorialPolyhedron' class.

The goal is to make this class consistent with the base class `Polyhedron_base`.

- #28603: `edge_graph` -> `vertex_graph`.
- #28604: `ridge_graph` -> `facet_graph`.
- #28605: Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.
  This is motivated by #10777.
- #28606: `unbounded(self)` -> `is_bounded(self)`.
- #28607: Make `f_vector` a vector.
- #28613: Replace `V` and `H` by more meaningful attributes/methods.
- #28614: `length_*` -> `n_*`.
- #28616: Replace `Vrepr()` and `Hrepr` by more consistent methods in `CombinatorialFace`.
- #28608: `repr` -> `rep` when abbreviating.
- #28757: Remove empty folder
- #29110: Make `dim` and alias for `dimension` in combinatorial polyhedron
- #29242: CombinatorialPolyhedron: `bit_repr_` -> `bit_rep_` 

Some of the tickets also take care of minor bug fixes or typos.

Some attributes like `bitrep_vertices` might have been an unfortunate choice:

As they are accessed by other classes, I'm forced to compute e.g. `bitrep_vertices` on initialization. If `CombinatorialPolyhedron` was ever to be a parent of `Polyhedron_base` (see #10777), this would force a polyhedron to compute the incidence matrix right away.

From my understanding, the decorator `@lazy_attribute` is not available for extension types directly. I'm thinking of changing those attributes to methods, such that there is a method `bitrep_facets` and an attribute `_bitrep_facets`. This way one can later change this to be lazily evaluated.

Any thoughts?

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A7):
> If a `@lazy_attribute` doesn't work, then just make it a `@cached_method` (with no arguments).

Does either one work with `cdef`?

Here, I want to give a small example of what I want to do:

```
sage: cython('''
....: cdef class BaseClass:
....:     cdef public int number
....: 
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.number = 2
....: ''')
sage: class NewClass(BaseClass):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         pass
....:     
sage: example = NewClass()
sage: example.number
0
```

I'm trying to somehow make `number` be a lazy attribute. The only solution I came up with, is to replace it by a method. Is there another way?


The background is that `CombinatorialPolyhedron` does require `Polyhedron` to compute the incidence matrix for correct initialization. If `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is to be a base class of `Polyhedron_base` at some point (#10777), it needs to be lazily initialized.

Is this the right approach, am I missing something? Is it acceptable to do those name changes? (`CombinatorialPolyhedron` still was not part of a stable release)

If so, I think the review is rather trivial and I can try to find someone else to do it.

Some comments:

Since these methods will then occur in the namespace, perhaps it would make sense to make it consistent with the names of the methods for `Polyhedron`. For example, `unbounded` -> `is_(un)bounded`. Probably it would make more sense to store `is_bounded` rather than `unbounded`....

Similar for `V` and `H`, having a method with only one letter is not so revealing...

I guess it is important to be careful with the naming at this precise moment as after, changing the name of methods will force the usage of deprecation warnings and that's annoying. (I believe that some methods should be changed to be consistent with `Polyhedron`...).

Well... 8.9.rc0 is already out... so time is running out... :-(

On which version of Sage is this based? Could you rebase on 8.9.rc0 so that we have a clear view of what is done in this ticket. Or is it actually already only stuff from this ticket?

- I would vote for `Vrep->Vrepresentation` same for `H`. This is what I meant originally with be consistent with `Polyhedron`, I should have specified it, my bad.

- You should also mention in the description of this ticket that you remove an empty folder. This is done in one of the commits. (This is a good habit to take for such small changes, otherwise, the penalty is: "please open a ticket just for that"...).

This ticket is huge, but almost all changes are trivial. Sorry, but that's what happens, when you change some names.
> 
> - I would vote for `Vrep->Vrepresentation` same for `H`. This is what I meant originally with be consistent with `Polyhedron`, I should have specified it, my bad.

In `Polyhedron` there is `Vrepresentation` and `Vrep-generator`. So in a way, both things are used.

Now for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` there is only `Vrepresentation` in the namespace. `_Vrep` is an internal cython variable, while `Vrep` is the cython method that accesses `_Vrep`. I tried to use `cpdef` for both of them, but that didn't work (`closures inside cpdef functions not yet supported`, seems to be connected with `smallInteger`). So as long as it is that way, I would propse leaving the python method named `Vrepresentation` and the cython method `Vrepr`. But I'm open for different suggestions.

Now with `CombinatorialFace` things are a bit different. At the moment there is `Vrep`, `Hrep`, `n_Vrepresentation` and `n_Hrepresentation` (not consistent, I just noticed). `Vrep` allows giving both the indices and the names of the Vrepresentation. So in a way it combines `ambient_Vrepresentation` and `ambient_V_indices` of `PolyhedronFace`. What do you suggest?

One option would be the following for `CombinatorialFace`:
- `Vrep` -> `ambient_Vrep`
- make `ambient_Vrepresentation` an alias for `ambient_Vrep(names=True)`
- make `ambient_V_indices` an alias for `ambient_V_indices(names=False)`
- `n_Vrepresentation` -> `n_ambient_Vreprentation`
- same for `Hrep`
Unfortunatly, those changes are going to make the ticket even larger.

What do you think? If I have a clear idea what to do, I think I can make the remaining changes tonight.

I was just making sure. Let's try to make it happen.

`V_rep` is shortened because `_generator` appears after. So I would vote for completing the name to `Vrepresentation`.

Got it! Looks good.

Ok. I see. I would do `Vrep` to `Vrepresentation`. Then, if `CombinatorialFace` has a different behavior than the `PolyhedronFace` I believe it is fine.

> One option would be the following for `CombinatorialFace`:

It seems like making the current `Vrep` private and have `ambient_Vrepresentation` (with the whole word) call this private function `Vrep(names=True)` and likewise for `ambient_V_indices` be more reasonable.

Why have 3 functions when we can have 2? Especially, the 2 functions behave as they do in `PolyhedronFace`... so I do not see the need to provide `Vrep` in the namespace.

I will. It's just one of those things that where perfectly clear to me, so I do didn't comment.

One more thing: Lots of changes are due to the changes of abbreciations `Vrepr` -> `Vrep` etc. I noticed you seem to at least use both. I could undo this change and this might make the ticket shorter.
