The problem occured in context with #4618 (see comment 32) and is explained by the following code:

```
sage: PS = PolynomialRing(SR,'x')
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: q = P((1,1,5)); q
5*x^2 + x + 1
sage: p = PS(q)
sage: p.coefficients()
[5*x^2 + x + 1]
p in SR
True
```


**Keywords:** symbolic ring days100

**Status:** new
