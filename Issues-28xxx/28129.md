In `vertex_connectivity`, we can certainly treat more cases when the connectivity is < 3 and `value_only is False`, but this can be done in another ticket.

I pushed a commit to that end, with also a minor edit to a docstring.

Other than that, positive review from me. If you agree, please set to positive review.
