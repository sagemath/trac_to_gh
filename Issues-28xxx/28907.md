Currently, the method `MathematicaElement.N()` returns a string [#point2 (2)], which is not useful for further computations. It also contradicts the convention of interface elements that `mathematica(1/3).N()` is a more pythonic syntax for `mathematica.N(mathematica(1/3))`, as is the case for all the dynamically added methods in interfaces. So for consistencey, the method `N()` should return a `MathematicaElement` instead of a string.

This ticket removes the method altogether, for simplicity, as it is not needed anymore [#point1 (1)]. Now a call to `mathematica(1/3).N()` dynamically redirects to Mathematica's `N[]` function and returns a `MathematicaElement` as expected.

This change also reveaved an issue with serialization of Mathematica elements, which is also fixed by this ticket (see `_reduce()`). The corresponding doctest was actually just serializing a string. This is now fixed:

```
sage: a = mathematica('N[Pi/2,50]')
sage: loads(dumps(a)) == a            # should be True
...
TypeError: Error executing code in Mathematica
CODE:
	sage8=
1.5707963267948966192313216916397514420985846996875529104874722961539082059438`50.;
Mathematica ERROR:
```

More details:

[=#point1 (1)] In the past, Sage's object hierarchy used to define a method `N()`, so it had to be overwritten in the interface, but that is no longer the case.

[=#point2 (2)] The return type was changed to string in #18888 as a workaround to an apparent bug in Mathematica itself. This bug does not seem to exist anymore in Mathematica 12, so the workaround is not needed anymore. Indeed, in the following computation, the decimal representation gets correctly truncated after 10 digits

whereas, in [[#18888 comment:20](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18888#comment:20)] with Mathematica 10.0, the same computation did not truncate the output
