We fix `neighbors` of `polyhedron.representation` to only specify inequalities/facets. In case of a non-full-dimensional polyhedron, the method had an index shift and did not return anything valuable (if not an error). The method appears to be used only in `stack`, so we do not set a deprecation warning (even so the method is now returning an error for equalities).

Also, we do some minor changes to `stack`:
- fix a bug: the stacked vertex needs to be in the relative interior of the `locus_polyhedron` (not just contained in),
- errors for non-proper faces,
- remove a redundant test (all vertices of a polyhedron satisfy all of its inequalities/equalites).

The method `neighbors()` says that it iterates over the adjacent inequalities *and equations*. However, its code uses the `facet_adjacency_matrix()` method which returns the adjacency of just the inequalities.
To solve this, I think we should introduce `H_adjacency_matrix()`, and use it in the code of `neighbors()`.

I added a suggested fix.

I changed `neighbors` to only include `facets`/`inequalities`. There is no meaning in checking anything else anyway, is there?

Additionally I changed a few things, which I noticed about `stacked`.

As `neighbors` did not work for polyhedra with equalities and is not altered for those with without, I don't think a deprecation error is needed.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
A few comments:

- You should put "Checking that :trac:`28463` is fixed::" in the docstring before the failing test coming from this ticket.

- I would not refer to an internal variable in the TEST block, but try to say it in words.

- It would be good to show the new raised ValueError at the end of the examples to say that you should do this on proper faces only (but really at the end, so that "working examples" come first...)

- Careful with 1 empty line after `::` and indentation of code blocks, otherwise documentation won't build.

- You introduced two useless empty lines it seems.

- Please reread what you changed in `representation` it seems contradictory "Does not work for inequalities::" and "AssertionError: must be inequality" is at best very confusing.

- I don't know what you are talking about with a deprecation: you are changing the behavior of the function, not changing a name or an option. In principle, this change is not wished. That is: we may break a lot of code doing so. That said, the code was broken, so fair enough. But the question remains: is there internal code that breaks due to a weird use of `neighbor()`? Could you check that? Then, I would say it should be a TypeError and not an AssertionError.

This is making it less precise. Why not say:

You forgot to indent the sage blocks.

Have you looked at the other places where `.neighbors` is used in the polyhedron folder?

Actually, I did fix a bug in stacked as well. The set of permittable points should be the relative interior of `locus_polyhedron`. This is not the way it was before. Maybe I should really set up another ticket for the fixes in `stack` and describe this in the ticket.

`position=4` is in the boundary of `locus_polyhedron` and before my fix it returned a wrong combinatorial type.

Not yet. The tests passed and so I figured it's fine. Also `neighbors` returned complete nonsense for non-fulldimensional cases due to index shifting. So if anyone has successfully used it, he or she got really lucky. Nevertheless, I can check.

No, I believe it is fine. This ticket is about the fact that stacking was not working (originally). So I would say that one can fix the bug and adapt the description of the ticket accordingly.

One more reason to mention this in the documentation before this test (how should I know that this is what is tested???).

Exactly, that's my point: just checking the tests is not enough. One should do a grep to see where this function is used _internally_.

Two minor things:

permittable -> possible, permitted, allowed
`position` -> ``position``


Once you fix these and the pyflakes error at line 8112, you can set it to positive review on my behalf.

P.S. Welcome back to work!
