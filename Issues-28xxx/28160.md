If `u` is a subword of `w`, then the complimentary of `u` in `w` is the subword made of all the letters from `w` after removing the ones of `u`. There might be more than one way to do so.

For example, `rice` is a subword of `vertices` and `vets` is its only complimentary. However, `an` in `banana` has 3 occurrences and the 3 complimentaries are `bana`, `bana` and `bnaa`.

I added a function to get all the complimentaries of a subword in a word.
