`X.is_field()` fails for many parent `X`. The matrix code relies a lot on the distinction ring/field. We change the code in the matrix folder to make the functions work for more base rings.

The ticket also
- simplifies the code of `adjugate`
- handles more matrix inversion (as reported in #27869)

Reviewer: Frédéric Chapoton
