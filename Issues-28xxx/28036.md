Because this is causing some random infinite loops when running the testsuite. To reproduce, as reported in https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/541, use:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/structure/ src/sage/interfaces/
``` 

Another symptom:

The doctest 

```
File "src/sage/structure/parent.pyx", line 1734, in sage.structure.parent.Parent.hom.register_embedding
Failed example:
    K.coerce_embedding()(a)
```
when it does not fail, and then one calls

```
K.coerce_embedding()
```
again, makes sage crash.

Removing the change of repr made in #21161 fixes that.

For the complete log when the doctest fails, see for example

https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/27408/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-52-generic/petitbonum/2019-06-20%2014:50:38?short

Adding the single line

```
gen = self.gen_embedding()
```
is enough to trigger the crash.

Thank you for analyzing this issue! Previous discussion in https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/541, were we assumed it was distro related.

I agree that it should be included in 8.8.

I do not get a crash with 8.8.rc2... :-S Hmm.

So there is no way to bypass the current issue and still be able to know via the `repr` that the NumberField is embedded? This is in itself problematic, right?

Reverting completely #21161 would be too bad... Isn't there any way to remove the crash caused by calling

```
gen = self.gen_embedding()
```

?

Did you test it? I don't understand how it can work, since `_embedding` is a cdef attribute. Apart from that, the idea looks sensible enough to me.

Another option may be to use a lazy string for the error message that causes the loop.
