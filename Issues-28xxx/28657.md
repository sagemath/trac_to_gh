Some new linux releases don't seem to include a `python` executable. They have `python3` but no `python` or `python2`. Sage should build on such systems.

Why not just create a link to python3 at `build/bin/python` ?

This patch is very invasive for no good reason I can see, and would make future use of Sage with system Python harder.

Removed changes to `ipython/spkg-install` which would have conflicted with #28673.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A12):
> Why not just create a link to python3 at `build/bin/python` ?

That's basically what `sage-system-python` is already.
 
> This patch is very invasive for no good reason I can see, and would make future use of Sage with system Python harder.

When installing a package, should we be using Sage's Python or the system Python? There are three established choices: during Sage's build use `sage-system-python` or `sage-python23` (which means the Python that Sage builds: it uses either `python2` or `python3` from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`). During runtime, There is also the script `sage-python`, which just runs `python2` or `python3`. We should probably use that one more and `sage-python23` less.

IMHO there is no reason to use Sage's python during installation of a package, unless we are installing a Python/Cython module for Sage's Python.

Now, think of a situation where Sage's Python and system Python are the same thing.
It is actually not too far-fetched; since PEP 370 it's prefectly possible to install Python modules (for a system-wide Python) into ~/.
And long-term it is probably the only viable option for Sage.

So, the fewer different Pythons we have around, the better...

Right now we are using four different ones: `python`, `sage-system-python`, `sage-python23`, and `sage-python`. The main point here is to eliminate the use of `python`. I also wonder if we should avoid `sage-python23`, since it explicitly calls `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python[2 or 3]`, and instead use `sage-python`, which runs `exec python2` or `exec python3`, letting the PATH determine where to find the program. I've done a little in that direction (changing `sage-python23` to `sage-python`), but more could be done. It doesn't need to be done on this ticket.

Right, on distro all the python versions resolve to the system python anyway. So this change is close to a no-op from a distro perspective.

The distro *is* the "system", so I can just add python to the dependency list and the package manager will make sure it's available. `python` is not installed by default on ubuntu, but if  the sage package depends on it it will still be installed for sage users.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A33):
> If you have a suggestion for what else to do with `doctest/control.py`, we can open a follow-up ticket.

Actually in the end I may have some :)
* line 643: use `sys.executable` so it is always the python you are currently using.
* line 1034 and associated doctests. Again `sys.executable` could be used and `...` be put in doctest since we don't know what that particular result is. But there is a first simplification `sage-runtests` is executable and already starts with `#!/usr/bin/env sage-python` in your case why do you need to override the `#!` here? In fact why do you even need the full path? It is already in your `$PATH` at this stage.

It seems that this broke the docker images, see #28738.

Is it intentional that we now need a system Python to be installed to run Sage? Or is the situation in the docker image somehow special and other users won't be affected by this?

What confuses me is the following in `sage`:

```
# Check to see if the whole Sage install tree has moved.  If so,
# change various hardcoded paths.  Skip this if we don't have write
# access to $SAGE_LOCAL (e.g. when running as a different user) or
# if Python and sage-location haven't been installed yet.
maybe_sage_location()
{
    if [ -w "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
        if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" ] && [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-location" ]; then
            sage-location || exit $?
        fi
    fi
}
```

But `sage-location` uses the system Python, so the check for `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` seems to be wrong.

It's explained in the comment, at least somewhat: I think the point is, don't bother to do this check if `local/bin/python` doesn't exist, because the Sage install tree is incomplete. 

In any case, it would be better to check for the existence of `local/bin/python` or `local/bin/python3`.

I don't think you can move a "normal" Sage tree at all. It needs to be specially prepared to be movable, and such a prepared tree does not work without first being moved.
