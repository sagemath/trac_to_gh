Some new linux releases don't seem to include a `python` executable. They have `python3` but no `python` or `python2`. Sage should build on such systems.

That's basically what `sage-system-python` is already.

When installing a package, should we be using Sage's Python or the system Python? There are three established choices: during Sage's build use `sage-system-python` or `sage-python23` (which means the Python that Sage builds: it uses either `python2` or `python3` from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`). During runtime, There is also the script `sage-python`, which just runs `python2` or `python3`. We should probably use that one more and `sage-python23` less.

I agree, and that's why my changes in `build/pkgs` are almost exclusively to use `sage-system-python`. The one exception is `entrypoints`, which installs a Python module.

Right now we are using four different ones: `python`, `sage-system-python`, `sage-python23`, and `sage-python`. The main point here is to eliminate the use of `python`. I also wonder if we should avoid `sage-python23`, since it explicitly calls `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python[2 or 3]`, and instead use `sage-python`, which runs `exec python2` or `exec python3`, letting the PATH determine where to find the program. I've done a little in that direction (changing `sage-python23` to `sage-python`), but more could be done. It doesn't need to be done on this ticket.

This was because `python` -> `python3` link was explicitly recommended against in PEP-0394. In April 2018, this was changed to make it okay for virtual envs and in June 2019, it was okay for the distributor to decide.

The distro *is* the "system", so I can just add python to the dependency list and the package manager will make sure it's available. `python` is not installed by default on ubuntu, but if  the sage package depends on it it will still be installed for sage users.

<a id='comment:38'></a>It seems that this broke the docker images, see #28738.

Is it intentional that we now need a system Python to be installed to run Sage? Or is the situation in the docker image somehow special and other users won't be affected by this?

What confuses me is the following in `sage`:

```
# Check to see if the whole Sage install tree has moved.  If so,
# change various hardcoded paths.  Skip this if we don't have write
# access to $SAGE_LOCAL (e.g. when running as a different user) or
# if Python and sage-location haven't been installed yet.
maybe_sage_location()
{
    if [ -w "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
        if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" ] && [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-location" ]; then
            sage-location || exit $?
        fi
    fi
}
```

But `sage-location` uses the system Python, so the check for `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` seems to be wrong.
