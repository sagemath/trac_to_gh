<a id='comment:3'></a>The pattern `sdh_XYZ || sdh_die ...` one sees in few places is not necessary, and `sdh_XYZ` alone suffices, isn't it?

By looking at the code of e.g. `sdh_configure`
one sees that `sdh_die` is actually called in `sdh_configure`, and so chaining them
as above is pointless (the part after `||` won't be called).

This should be mentioned in the docs.

Oops, sorry.

Maybe we can leave #24023 open for that.

No problem.  Personally I sometimes even prefer opening separate tickets for specific solutions to a problem from the ticket for the problem itself.
