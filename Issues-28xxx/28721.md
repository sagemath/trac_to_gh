The pattern `sdh_XYZ || sdh_die ...` one sees in few places is not necessary, and `sdh_XYZ` alone suffices, isn't it?

By looking at the code of e.g. `sdh_configure`
one sees that `sdh_die` is actually called in `sdh_configure`, and so chaining them
as above is pointless (the part after `||` won't be called).

This should be mentioned in the docs.

By the way, there was already a ticket for this task at #24023.

Something I wanted to do for that was to have a way to automatically include the in-line docs in `sage-dist-helpers` into the Sphinx docs, but I would have needed to write a plugin, and didn't get to do it.

Maybe we can leave #24023 open for that.

No problem.  Personally I sometimes even prefer opening separate tickets for specific solutions to a problem from the ticket for the problem itself.

That makes sense.

specifically about JSON files, de-installation is handled by `build/sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py`, and there are good docs there, but I don't know where these JSON files are written.

I have a vague recollection I knew it once, but it's not clear to me now, without digging through the whole command chain and makefiles... :-(

Seems to be written by `build/bin/sage-spkg`, starting at line 1000:

```
PKG_NAME_INSTALLED="$SAGE_SPKG_INST/$PKG_NAME"
cat > "$PKG_NAME_INSTALLED" << __EOF__
{
    "package_name": "$PKG_BASE",
    "package_version": "$PKG_VER",
    "install_date": "$(date)",
    "system_uname": "$(uname -a)",
    "sage_version": "$(cat "${SAGE_ROOT}/VERSION.txt")",
    "test_result": "$TEST_SUITE_RESULT",
    "files": [
        $FILE_LIST
    ]
}
__EOF__
```
The file manifest is constructed at line 899-900:

```
    # Generate installed file manifest
    FILE_LIST="$(cd "$PREFIX" && find . -type f -o -type l | sed 's|^\./||' | sort)"
```
