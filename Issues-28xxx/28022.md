this seems to be a wrong (always succeeding) test for the presense of rubiks package:

```
        try:
            import sage.interfaces.rubik  # here to avoid circular referencing
        except ImportError:
            algorithm = 'gap'
```
indeed, the interface is always there, whether or not rubiks is installed.
