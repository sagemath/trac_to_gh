[qepcad-B.1.71] /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/ar: illegal option -- U
```

A few more linux-specific things need to be addressed to make it compile.

Also, QEPCAD B.1.72 is out:
- https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/qepcad/INSTALL/qepcad-B.1.72.tar.gz
and Fedora has a number of valuable patches that we should use: 
- https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qepcad-B/tree/master

Also fails on ubuntu-bionic (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/430688625?check_suite_focus=true)
and ubuntu-bionic-i386 (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/430689089)

ubuntu-trusty (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/434148305?check_suite_focus=true):

Fedora 28 (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/430688823?check_suite_focus=true)


This ticket fixes these problems.
