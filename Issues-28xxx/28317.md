Here's what I get

```
~/sage$ echo $CC
/projects/66d93023-00f0-4c12-8a25-5d6d4e486740/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-cc

~/sage$ $CC -print-prog-name=ld
/projects/66d93023-00f0-4c12-8a25-5d6d4e486740/sage-build/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu/7.3.0/../../../../x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu/bin/ld

~/sage$ $CC -print-file-name=ld
ld

~/sage$ echo $LD
/projects/66d93023-00f0-4c12-8a25-5d6d4e486740/sage-build/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-ld
```

Therefore `-print-file-name` is clearly not what we need.
`-print-prog-name` gives a path with `..`s in it.

We need to check that the two files are equivalent using -ef which checks that the files are the same.
