So this will look poorly in the final doc because Sphinx does not handle nesting of math formatting:

```diff
-*Propriétés combinatoires des `f`-palindromes*,
+*Propriétés combinatoires des* `f`-*palindromes*,
```
It probably would also be good to make this into math formatting:

```
-    12...(n-1)n(n-1)...21.  They are the restriction of the type C
+    `12 \cdots (n-1)n(n-1) \cdots 21`.  They are the restriction of the type C
```
Similarly, there probably should be some code formatting added in `stanley_symm_poly_weight`. Moreover, the `w` in `INPUT:` has an unnecessary space in front of it (likely making it over-indented in the doc).
