In two of the PREP tutorials
* http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Symbolics-and-Basic-Plotting.html#basic-3d-plotting
* http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Advanced-2DPlotting.html#vector-fields
there is mention of 3d glasses viewing

```
(right-click on the plot and select “Style” and “Stereographic”)
```
but this only works with jmol.  One should modify these appropriately to include `viewer='jmol'`.  Unless threejs supports this?  But I believe not.
