This error results from incompatible statements from the user. The first one is

```
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
```
When asked to construct the module of vector fields just after the manifold declaration, in absence of any further information, Sage returns a module over C<sup>oo</sup>(M) that is not free, since this is the generic case. But then the second statement:

```
sage: X.<x, y> = M.chart()
```
implies that M is parallelizable, since it can be covered by a single chart. The set of vector fields must then be a free module over C<sup>oo</sup>(M).  Hence the incompatibility. 

If one reverses the order of the two statements, then everything is fine:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x, y> = M.chart()
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: XM
Free module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: XM.category()
Category of finite dimensional modules over Algebra of differentiable scalar fields
 on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
Indeed, when asked for the module of vector fields, Sage knows that it must be a free module, the manifold being manifestly parallelizable. 

If one would like to keep the original order, i.e. create the module of vector fields before the chart, one must set the optional argument `force_free` to `True`:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module(force_free=True)
sage: X.<x, y> = M.chart()
sage: XM
Free module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

So I would say that to avoid the `AttributeError`, one shall return an explicit error message when trying to create a chart, the domain of which is assumed to be not parallelizable.

Hi Eric, thanks for the explanation that makes complete sense.

To provide further context to this ticket, no one actually intentionally tried to do things in the order reported.  Rather, we were investigating an unrelated issue where, for some reason, it seems some doctests were being run out of order and/or skipping statements.  So it just happened that this was run by the doctest runner (even though there's no test that actually does this intentionally).

One could claim "garbage in, garbage out".  However, it still seemed like a real bug that we were getting a seemingly random `AttributeError` in this case.

I agree with your assessment that the best thing to do here would be to catch this case and raise a more useful exception.

To explain further, last week I ran `make ptestlong`
on Cygwin on Windows 7 for the first time
(on SageMath 8.9.beta5 built from source there).
It gave a dozen of failures not observed on other systems.

One of these failures seemed to boil down to the present example.

In `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.py`
we find the class `VectorFieldModule` with its many methods
including `identity_map` and `zero`.

The method `identity_map` has tests starting at line 1003:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, M)
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: X.identity_map()
```

The method `zero` comes next, with tests starting at line 1023:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, M)
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()  # makes M parallelizable
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: XM.zero()
```

One possible explanation to the observed error would be that when running

```
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.py
```
the doctest runner skipped the "repeated" line

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, M)
```
in the doctests for `zero`, re-using the `M` defined using an
identical line in the previous doctest.

If we figure out exactly what goes wrong, we'll open a targeted ticket.

Sorry for the extra work here, maybe no user would ever have typed that.

Why should the doctest runner skip this line? `Manifold` has *not* the unique representation property: each call to it, even with the same arguments, generates a different object. In other words, in any Sage session, we have

```
sage: Manifold(2, 'M') is Manifold(2, 'M')
False
```

With the above commit, a `ValueError` is now returned, with a more explicit message:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: X.<x, y> = M.chart()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: the Module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional
 differentiable manifold M has already been constructed as a
 non-free module, which implies that the 2-dimensional
 differentiable manifold M is not parallelizable and hence cannot
 be the domain of a coordinate chart
```
Similarly, if one attempts to construct a vector frame, while XM is not a free module, one now gets

```
sage: e = M.vector_frame('e')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: the Module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional
 differentiable manifold M has already been constructed as a
 non-free module and therefore cannot have a basis
```
