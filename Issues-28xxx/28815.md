```
Currently (after #29701), `src/setup.py` determines what "distributions" to build using `is_package_installed_and_updated`, which inspects the installation records found in `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` = `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` and also the information in `$SAGE_PKGS` = `$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs`.

Instead, we make it configurable via `sage_conf`, falling back to testing features.

(Note that after #30779, `src/setup.py` is intended to be invoked by the user for user-defined venvs, and is separate from `build/pkgs/sagelib/setup.py`, which is used by the Sage distribution.)

Alternative approach:
- #29119 Add an autoconf configure script for `sagelib`



Depends on #30779
