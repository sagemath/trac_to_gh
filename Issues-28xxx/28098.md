```
In the documentation of the `shortest_path()` method of `GenericGraph` we can read

```
If there is no path from `u` to `v`, the returned list is empty.
```

In the documentation of the `shortest_path_length()` method of `GenericGraph` we can read

```
If there is no path from `u` to `v`, returns ``Infinity``.
```


But actually in many cases the methods stop with an error instead of returning an empty list or infinity, respectively:

```python
## Minimum repro
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_vertices([1, 2])
sage: G.shortest_path(1, 2, algorithm='BFS')
      # result: KeyError, expected: []
sage: G.shortest_path_length(1, 2, algorithm='BFS')
      # result: KeyError, expected: +Infinity
sage: G.shortest_path(1, 2, algorithm='Dijkstra_NetworkX')
      # result: KeyError, expected: []
sage: G.shortest_path_length(1, 2, algorithm='Dijkstra_NetworkX')
      # result: KeyError, expected: +Infinity
sage: G.shortest_path(1, 2, algorithm='Dijkstra_Bid_NetworkX')
      # result: NetworkXNoPath, expected: []
sage: G.shortest_path_length(1, 2, algorithm='Dijkstra_Bid_NetworkX')
      # result: NetworkXNoPath, expected: +Infinity
sage: G.shortest_path(1, 2, algorithm='Bellman-Ford_Boost')
      # result: KeyError, expected: []
sage: G.shortest_path_length(1, 2, algorithm='Bellman-Ford_Boost')
      # result: KeyError, expected: +Infinity
```

I'm using [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 8.8, Release Date: 2019-06-26, with Python 2.7.15, on Ubuntu 18.04.2 64bit.
