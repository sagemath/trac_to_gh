```
The `sign` method of `HypergeometricData` sometimes returns answers that do not agree with Magma:

```
sage: from sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive import HypergeometricData as Hyp
sage: H = Hyp(cyclotomic=([6,2],[1,1,1]))
sage: [H.sign(1/4,p) for p in [5,7,11,13,17,19]] #correct
[1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1]
sage: H = Hyp(cyclotomic=([1,1,1],[6,2]))
sage: [H.sign(4,p) for p in [5,7,11,13,17,19]] #should agree but doesn't
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
```
I believe this is because Magma's formula is not valid when `0 in alpha`. Note that this does not affect the `padic_H_value` or `euler_factor` methods because these do an alpha-beta swap to avoid this case (just as in Magma).

I have a fix for this coded up locally. Will post a patch shortly.

Maybe we should instead always switch when creating the object (in the `__init__`) when `0 in alpha` ?
