This ticket implements a method to initialize a cone from vertices, rays, inequations and equalities.

More precisely
- we outsource a new method `_cone_from_normaliz_data` from the existing method `_init_from_normaliz_data`.
- Then we add a method `_cone_from_Vrepresentation_and_Hrepresentation`, which returns a cone form `vertices`, `rays`, `ieqs` and `eqns`.

Note that lines must be recomputed, hence the cone might reorder them.

The trivial cases of neither rays nor lines or without inequalities are not covered by this method. In either case `None` is returned.

As a follow up we
- fix `Polyhedron_normaliz.save` in #26363,
- we allow converting to `'normaliz'` backend with both Vrep and Hrep in the spirit of #22701.

I fixed the alignment error and also at the place, where I copied it from.

The method is not being used yet. I added a branch to #26363, which uses it in order to fix pickling/unpickling.
Initializing from both `Vrep` and `Hrep` does not work yet. Eventually, we should open a new ticket and allow it at least when converting to backend normaliz.
