Derivation with respect to `var` has different behaviors for polynomials. Basically, the first test that is performed is whether `var` is the generator of the polynomial ring. But the test is performed in two different ways depending on the implementations:

* Either `var is self._parent.gen()` (or equivalent);
* Or `var == self._parent.gen()`.

The consequence is as follows:

```python
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: R.gen().derivative(x) # implemented with ==
1 
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: R.gen().derivative(x) # implemented with is
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute '_derivative'
```

My proposal is to replace all the `is`'s by `==`'s. It also solves problems with derivatives of rational functions, see #26844. 

Altogether, the behavior for univariate polynomials is the following after my changes, consistently:

* `p.derivative(x)` returns the derivative of `p` if `bool(x == p.parent().gen())` returns `True` (it includes some cases where `x` is not the generator itself);
* `p.derivative(t)` (with `t != p.parent().gen()`) returns the polynomial obtained after derivation of each coefficient of `p` with respect to `t`;
* if `t` does not appear to be a variable of `p` (even recursively), an exception is raised¹.


¹ Initially, I wanted to return `0` when differentiating with respect to a variable not in `p`, but this causes quite a lot of non trivial code since one should also be able to raise an Exception if one tries to differentiate with respect to something that does not appear to be a variable (w.r.t `2*x`, `x+y` or `12` for instance).

<a id='comment:8'></a>It definitely should not be using `is` for comparison as

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: 1*x is x
False
sage: 1*x == x
True
```
So I think it is too easy to pass something that `==` to a generator but not `is` a generator.

Two little things that once done you can set a positive review on my behalf. This needs a blank line:

```diff
         Check that :trac:`28187` is fixed::
+
             sage: x = var("x")
             sage: f._derivative(x)
             4*x^3 - 1
```
This is just some PEP8 cleanup to make the code look nicer (while we are at it):

```diff
-                return P({n:self.__coeffs[n]._derivative(var) \
-                            for n in self.__coeffs})
+                return P({n:self.__coeffs[n]._derivative(var)
+                           for n in self.__coeffs})
