The following reveals a relevant difference. This is with Python 2:

```
sage: F=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: FF=tensor((F,F))
sage: I=FF.basis().keys()
sage: type(I)
<class 'sage.combinat.combinat.MapCombinatorialClass'>
sage: I.__hash__
<method-wrapper '__hash__' of MapCombinatorialClass object at 0x7f58b5a22338>
```
With Python 3 the `I.__hash__` is None.

This appears to be explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53518981/inheritance-hash-sets-to-none-in-a-subclass
