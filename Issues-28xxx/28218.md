The uninstaller looks in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`
for a list of files to unstall. However, it seems to contain no files:

```
{
    "package_name": "awali",
    "package_version": "1.0.2-190218",
    "install_date": "Sat Jul 20 10:44:01 BST 2019",

    "sage_version": "SageMath version 8.9.beta2, Release Date: 2019-07-10",
    "test_result": "",
    "files": [

}
```

I have no idea what this package is, but it sounds like it just doesn't fully perform a [DESTDIR](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html) installation properly.

Whatever you do you just need to make sure that when the package is "installed" it correctly installs all files to the temporary root given by SAGE_DESTDIR (most of the `sdh_` commands take care of this automatically, for packages that do things in a standard way).

Your package should not be installing files directly into `SAGE_LOCAL`.  If it's doing that then its build script is wrong.
