The uninstaller looks in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`
for a list of files to unstall. However, it seems to contain no files:

no, it doesn't get uninstalled, `local/lib/python*/site-packages/awalipy*` files still linger on. And they are not listed in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`.

One way around it would be to add `spkg-legacy-uninstall` file, although, strictly speaking, simply removing these files there is not completely kosher.
(Although `spkg-legacy-uninstall` does this kind of removal).

I read somewhere that `distutils2` have an uninstall feature, but I have no idea what `distutils2` is.

I have no idea what this package is, but it sounds like it just doesn't fully perform a [DESTDIR](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html) installation properly.

Whatever you do you just need to make sure that when the package is "installed" it correctly installs all files to the temporary root given by SAGE_DESTDIR (most of the `sdh_` commands take care of this automatically, for packages that do things in a standard way).

Your package should not be installing files directly into `SAGE_LOCAL`.  If it's doing that then its build script is wrong.
