With the changes in the coding component, the classes `AbstractLinearCode` and `AbstractLinearRankMetricCode` share a lot of the same code. To avoid this and also make creating new linear codes with different metrics easier, we propose to create a new class, `AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric`, which will stand between `AbstractCode` and `AbstractLinearCode`/`AbstractLinearRankMetricCode`. This class will contain all the methods relevant for linear codes, which do not depend on a metric. In practice this is mostly methods related to generator matrix.

I created the class `AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric` and moved stuff from `AbstractLinearCode` there, including the category theory set up. I don't understand what the `facade` does, but when I remove it, the test suite test in `LinearCode` is unhappy. 

The only thing I couldn't get to work was the requirement that the dimension of the code is at most the length. The problem is that the dimension requires a generator matrix (unless it's given) and that causes some issues. I kept the check line commented out in `__init__` of `AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric`.

Unlike `AbstractCode`, in `AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric`, it is required that subclasses have default encoders/decoders. This should make sense since we require a generic constructor class.

Hello,

I'm not really satisfied with the names of the classes.
Instead, I would propose the following hierarchy:

```
AbstractCode
  AbstractLinearCode
    AbstractLinearMetricCode
      AbstractLinearHammingMetricCode  # if relevant
      AbstractLinearRankMetricCode
```

Also, through it is not directly related to this ticket, I don't understand the purpose of the class `LinearCode`...

I'd propose that we complete this ticket and #28209 (which depends on this ticket) with as few chnages as posssible,
and then go on with renaming/redesigning.

Dima, is there a specific reason you refrain from reviewing yourself? I'm completely swamped right now, so there's no chance I'll do it any time soon, but I remember being fairly happy about the design during GSoC.

@xcaruso: Concerning your proposed naming, I guess your names are better from a completely general point of view. The current naming is for "historic reasons" centering on classical "linear codes over Hamming metric" being what everyone would expect. So in some sense the names follow the principal of least surprise by specifically pointing out in the name when it differs from the "expected". But I think I could easily be talked into going with your hierarchy.

The purpose of `LinearCode` btw is to act as a thin wrapper around `AbstractLinearCode` for constructing "unstructured" codes directly from a generator matrix. That's an essential class for users. The distinction from `AbstractLinearCode` was created as part of the encoder-framework (long story), but is a typical way to construct a class hierarchy in more strongly typed languages: if I could do so in Python, I would specify on a type level that AbstractLinearCode is not supposed to be instantiated directly.
