#22701 implemented setting up a polyhedron from both Vrep and Hrep for the backend field.

There are plans to allow the same for polymake #26368 and with #28639 at hand we can do the same for normaliz.

So it makes sense to set up a general framework for initializing from Vrep and Hrep. This ticket does this (or rather moves what was done in #22701 accordingly).

If a backend implements the method `_init_from_Vrepresentation_and_Hrepresentation`, then the initialization of `Polyhedron_base` may use it if `Vrep_minimal` and `Hrep_minimal` is both set to true.

This option will not be exposed in the function `Polyhedron`, as a user should really know what they are doing.

Also the method `_element_constructor_polyhedron` of `Polyhedra_base` sets up the new polyhedron from both representations, if `self.Element` has the method `_init_from_Vrepresentation_and_Hrepresentation`.
