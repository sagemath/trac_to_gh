Well, technically the shuffle algebra should be in the category of commutative Hopf algebras, so it might be better to use the category of `Bialgebras(R).Commutative()`.

```python

    Return the antipode on the basis element ``w``.
    """
    mone = -self.base_ring().one()
    return self.term(w.reversal(), mone**len(w))
```
along with in the dual PBW basis

```python
def antipode(self, elt):
    """
    Return the antipode of the element ``elt``.
    """
    return self(self.expansion(elt).antipode())
