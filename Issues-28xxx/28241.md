```
The number field `abs_val` method incorrectly
returns the square of the absolute value
for non-real places.

That ruins the triangle inequality:

```
sage: K = NumberField(x**2+1, 'i')
sage: p = K.places()[0]
sage: K.abs_val(p, 1 + 1)
4.0
sage: K.abs_val(p, 1)
1.0
```

We remove the squaring to fix this
and add examples.
