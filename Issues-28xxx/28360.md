As can be seen on https://jupyter.org/, JupyterLab has recently reached v1.0 and become the standard jupyter notebook. While [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) does have JupyterLab, it's stuck back at v0.33. Hence it would be nice to see an update.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Well, with SageMath 8.9.beta6 (Python 3 version), running

```
sage -pip install jupyterlab
```
installs JupyterLab 1.0.6. 
Then 

```
sage -n jupyterlab
```
seems to work nice.

On the other side, with the Python 2.7 version of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 8.9.beta6, only the version 0.33.12 of JupyterLab is installed. Could it be that JupyterLab 1.0 is available for Python 3 only ?

So far users can `sage --pip install jupyterlab` but we don't package it.

See #24904 and #26059 for making JupyterLab an optional or a standard package.

I wonder why you think that. So far, JupyterLab has not been part of the Sage distribution. As Samuel mentioned, see #24904 and #26059.
