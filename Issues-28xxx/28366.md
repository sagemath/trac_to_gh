Keywords: time, cygwin, Windows7

In `src/sage/ring/padics/lattice_precision.py`, use
`if status` rather than `if total_time > 0`.

They are supposed to be equivalent, but the clock
resolution in Cygwin on Windows 7 is so low that `total_time` can be zero even when `status`
evaluates to `True` as a boolean.
