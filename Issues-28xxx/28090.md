I came up with a complicated curve that I was trying to analyze
and perform a genus calculation:

```
sage: F.<c> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: PP1.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(F, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^4 + c*y^4, y^4])

sage: R.<x, c> = QQ[]
sage: p = f.dynatomic_polynomial(3)
sage: # P is the second dynatomic polynomial in the correct ring
sage: P = eval(str(p.specialization({y: 1})).replace("^", "**"))
sage: print(P)
sage: print(Curve(P).genus())
```

(I'm showing a way to generate the same curve that's a bit hack-y,
but it makes it a self-contained example rather than copy-pasting
a very long expression for the curve).

After 30 minutes of running the `genus()` function, Sage exits
with no stack trace, with a message like

```
.../sage/src/bin/sage-python: line 2: 19676 Killed
sage -python "$@"
```

According to the documentation (page 44 of [http://doc.sagemath.org/pdf/en/reference/curves/curves.pdf](http://doc.sagemath.org/pdf/en/reference/curves/curves.pdf)),
Sage uses Singular for this calculation, so I'd assume it's a bug
in Singular that makes it crash. Interestingly though, Maple is
able to compute this genus in around 10 seconds in contrast to
the 30 minutes it took Sage before it crashed. Using Singular
for this calculation is probably very un-optimal, and leaves
a lot of room for improvement.

The equivalent Maple code (using for `f` the expression printed
from Sage for `P`):

```
with(algcurves):
f := ...
genus(f, x, y)
```
outputs 28.

I ran into the same issue with this complicated curve:
