Ticket #27760 introduced the 120-cell in the library, but it does not give the classical construction of Coxeter form 1969 available on Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell

This ticket provides this classical construction which is much faster since it uses only a degree 2 extension of the rationals.

Depends on #27760

I think this can be simplified:

```diff
-list(set([tuple(p) for p in flatten([Permutations(list(c)).list() for c in cp])]))
+list(set([tuple(p) for c in cp for p in Permutations(list(c))]))
```
so there are less transient (large) lists. Also, you should be able to do

```python
verts += itertools.chain.from_iterable([p(tuple(c)) for p in even_perm] for c in cp)
```
since `+=` for lists works for iterators and you might as well pass a iterable to `from_iterable` to avoid storing the entire list in memory (twice). Next, I would use latex formatting here: <code>of type \`H_4\`::</code>. Finally, is it reasonable to do this test with the backend that comes standard with Sage? In that same vein, how long does the normaliz test take?

Hi Travis,

Thanks for the feedback, I'll do the changes.

The new implementation with normaliz takes less than 1 sec. Before, it was taking much longer that's why it was tagged not tested.

Now, for the default `'field'` backend, I did not test, but I expect it to take a long while. But I'll test it and write it here for the record.

On that not, it makes sense to define `phi` outside the `if ... else` environment.\n\n- \n\n```diff\n-            sage: polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz',construction='as_permutahedron') # not tested - long time\n+            sage: polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz', construction='as_permutahedron') # not tested - long time\n```\n\n- \n\n```\n# The 64 permutations of [\u00b12,\u00b12,0,0] (the \u00b1 are independant)\n```\n  I count 24.\n\n- I somehow don't like the construction with the Cartesian product. In the comments its all so easy and then I have to think about, why this is exactly true.\n\n  Couldn't we make a use of `product` from `itertools`? This creates all possible signs and then we just multiply (elementwise) all permutations:\n\n  ```\n  verts = [[sign[i]*perm[i] for i in range(4)] for sign in product(*[[1,-1]]*4) for perm in verts_without_sign]\n```\n\nFor the record:\n\n```\nsage: %time polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz')\nCPU times: user 1.04 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 1.05 s\nWall time: 255 ms\nA 4-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 with sqrt5 = 2.236067977499790?)^4 defined as the convex hull of 600 vertices\nsage: %time polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='field')\nCPU times: user 18.1 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 18.2 s\nWall time: 18.2 s\nA 4-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 with sqrt5 = 2.236067977499790?)^4 defined as the convex hull of 600 vertices\nsage: %time polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz',construction='as_permutahedron')\nCPU times: user 17.2 s, sys: 52 ms, total: 17.2 s\nWall time: 15.5 s\n```",

A few comments:

- Most importantly `exact=False` does not work. `base_ring` is not defined. Also you don't define `sqrt5`. On that not, it makes sense to define `phi` outside the `if ... else` environment.

- 

```diff
-            sage: polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz',construction='as_permutahedron') # not tested - long time
+            sage: polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz', construction='as_permutahedron') # not tested - long time
```

- 

```
# The 64 permutations of [¬±2,¬±2,0,0] (the ¬± are independant)
```
  I count 24.

- I somehow don't like the construction with the Cartesian product. In the comments its all so easy and then I have to think about, why this is exactly true.

  Couldn't we make a use of `product` from `itertools`? This creates all possible signs and then we just multiply (elementwise) all permutations:

  ```
  verts = [[sign[i]*perm[i] for i in range(4)] for sign in product(*[[1,-1]]*4) for perm in verts_without_sign]
```

I should have read the code better...
Didn't know that cartesian product does exactly that. Just figured it's way to many lines for something that simple and then I stopped reading and tried to find a shorter solution.

Still one could do all the signs with one line instead of doing it over and over again. Something like:

```diff

But I guess it's up to taste, what one prefers.

I did the changes. I decided to keep the construction as is.

I added a raise ValueError if one tries to construct it with `RDF` as cdd returns a numerical inconsistency error.

Some minor things:

- The order should be consistent here:

```
+            # The 64 permutations of [¬±2,¬±2,0,0] (the ¬± are independant)
+            verts = Permutations([0,0,2,2]).list() + Permutations([0,0,-2,-2]).list() + 
Permutations([0,0,2,-2]).list()
```
  also I still count 24 permutations as I already mentioned.
- I'm a bit puzzled, where you remove the duplicates here:

```
+                # The cartesian product creates duplicates, so we reduce it:
+                verts += itertools.chain.from_iterable([p(tuple(c)) for p in even_perm] for c in cp)
```
- Instead of importing `itertools` I would vote for importing just `itertools.chain`.
  Otherwise you might also consider to use `itertools.product` instead of `sage.categories.cartesian_product`.
- Whats the point of naming it `K` here?

```
K = QuadraticField(5, 'sqrt5')
base_ring = K
```

Typo. Fixed.

Well, this does what I want, what else can I say? It is very annoying to write something that creates them without duplicates, and we are dealing with a negligible amount of vertices, so I see now reason to make a fuss about inefficiency here.

Done.

That's a wonderful rhetorical question. My rhetorical answer: to make you ask rhetorical questions. ;-)

Well, as every entry is unique, the cartesian product creates no duplicates. Hence, you don't have to remove them.

This is why I find this comment very confusing. You comment that you will remove duplicates, but neither are there duplicate nor do you do any instructions that would remove duplicates, if they where there.

Also you have a typo in your chain import, so this doesn't build.

Oops, yes, I changed the `import` to `from`.

Perhaps my comment is not clear enough, it is not the cartesian product but the action of the even permutations:

```diff
+            import itertools import chain
+            even_perm_vectors = [[[0],[phi_inv**2,-phi_inv**2],[1,-1],[-(phi**2),phi**2]],
+                                 [[0],[phi_inv,-phi_inv],[phi,-phi],[-sqrt5,sqrt5]],
+                                 [[phi_inv,-phi_inv],[1,-1],[phi,-phi],[-2,2]]]
+            even_perm = AlternatingGroup(4)
+            for vect in even_perm_vectors:
+                cp = cartesian_product(vect)
+                # The cartesian product creates duplicates, so we reduce it:
+                verts += chain.from_iterable([p(tuple(c)) for p in even_perm] for c in cp)
                                               ^-------p acts here and creates duplicates
