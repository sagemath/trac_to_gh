In #27490 I hacked together a replacement for the `sage_setup.docbuild.build_many` function, which implements (blocking) parallel map() of sorts, which solved some problems with using `multiprocessing.Pool.map` that stems from its use of threads to fork new processes.

That solved a problem that was specific to older versions of Cygwin.  However, there is a similar problem, which affects all platforms, with PARI built with multi-threading support: #26608.

Although the PARI problem begs a more complete solution, at least for the docbuild we can get around it by using the `build_many` from #27490.

This ticket makes some fixes and enhancements to `build_many`, so that it can also return a result from the function it runs.  For the docbuild this feature is not strictly needed, except for the fact that it can also be used (as in `Pool.map`) to raise any exception that occurs in one of the worker processes.  Thus, it's closer in functionality, at least for the purposes of the docbuild, to `Pool.map`.
