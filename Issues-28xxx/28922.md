This patch changes four things concerning series expansions in the function field code:

1. The uniformizing variable can be specified

   This patch adds an optional `local_uniformizer` argument to `FunctionField`'s `completion()` method.  ~~It accepts either a function field element or an element of the Symbolic Ring constructed from a root of a function field element.  This allows, for example, `sqrt(x)` to be specified as a uniformizing variable without knowing a specific function field element that is a square root of `x`.~~

   If the specified element is not a uniformizing variable at the given place, an exception is raised.

2. ~~If a series expansion is exact, the `O(s^n)` is dropped.  So, for example, the following test case:~~

```
K.<x> = FunctionField(QQbar); _.<Y> = K[]
L.<y> = K.extension(Y^2 + Y + x + 1/x)
O = L.maximal_order()
I = O.ideal(y)
pl = I.divisor().support()[0]
m = L.completion(pl, prec=5)
m(x)
```
   ~~now returns `I + s` instead of `I + s + O(s^5)`.~~

3. ~~The precision is now specified as absolute precision, instead of relative.  This is a **backwards incompatible** change made to bring the function field code into alignment with the rest of Sage.  So, now, this test:~~

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(2)); _.<Y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(Y^2 + Y + x + 1/x)
sage: p = L.places_finite()[0]
sage: m = L.completion(p)
sage: m(x+y, 5)
```

   ~~returns `s^-1 + 1 + s^2 + s^4 + O(s^5)` instead of `s^-1 + 1 + s^2 + O(s^4)`~~

4. Function field elements can now be raised to fractional powers.  ~~If the fractional power does not exist in the function field, a result in the Symbolic Ring is returned.~~  While not, strictly speaking, a change to the series expansion code, this change allows fractional powers like `x^(1/3)` to be specified as uniformizing variables.

Taylor and Laurent series expansions in the Symbolic Ring are specified using absolute precision.

```
sage: var('x')
x

sage: sin(x).series(x,4)
1*x + (-1/6)*x^3 + Order(x^4)

sage: (1/(x^2+x)).series(x,4)
1*x^(-1) + (-1) + 1*x + (-1)*x^2 + 1*x^3 + Order(x^4)

```

I am not aware of any other examples.

My comments:

4. Function field elements can now be raised to fractional powers. 

As far as I understand, fractional power, as an operation, is not well defined for elements of an algebraic function field. It may not even exist, and then you return a symbolic ring element. I don't get this. In general, I object to the idea of injecting symbolic ring stuff into exact function field computation.

2. If a series expansion is exact, the `O(s^n)` is dropped. 

Why slow down series expansion computation to check if it is exact? If you want an exact result for your computation, you can check it and get it. This does not make sense to me.

1. The uniformizing variable can be specified

Ok. But please use the name `local_uniformizer`or shortly `uniformizer` for consistency. This is only acceptable if you do not clutter the series expansion code with the fractional power stuff.

3. The precision is now specified as absolute precision, instead of relative. 

Ok. But this need a deprecation warning as it is an user interface change.

OK, I'll drop the symbolic ring stuff, and only return fractional powers if they actually exist, otherwise raise an exception.

I did the symbolic ring stuff so that a uniformizing variable could be specified as something like `sqrt(x)` even if such an element didn't actually exist.

I'm not sure how to do that.  The current deprecation warnings are for entire methods that have been dropped.  I don't think we have anything to announce that an existing method has changed its interpretation of its arguments, nor can I think of a good way to implement such a warning, since the code could never tell which interpretation was intended.

191         numer = right.numerator()

193 
194         if denom == 1:

206             raise ValueError("not a %s power"%Integer(denom).ordinal_str())
```

The algorithm's logic runs like this:

1. Valuations are multiplicative homomorphisms, i.e, μ(fg) = μ(f) + μ(g)
2. This implies μ(f<sup>n</sup>) = nμ(f)
3. So if the divisor of f is ∑mP, the divisor of f<sup>n</sup> is ∑nmP
4. All of the nm products have to be integers for this to be a well-formed divisor
5. This yields line 199, with `TypeError` raised if any of nm's aren't integers
6. `Droot` has total degree zero, so `basis` will have either zero or one elements
7. If it has zero elements, line 201 will raise `IndexError`
8. If we make it to line 202, we've found an element with the correct divisor

Is there a flaw in any of this?

I see. Thanks. 

It seems you are assuming the constant field is full, that is, the base constant field is the algebraic closure of itself. Right? Then perhaps you can develop the algorithm further such that it works without that assumption. Moreover this would be a prerequisite for `is_square` to work correctly.

`self`/`root^n` is in the full constant field, which is the Riemann-Roch space of zero divisor.
