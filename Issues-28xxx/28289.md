For example, I modify `~/.sage/ipython-5.0.0/profile_default/ipython_config.py` to set the `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.colors` to a different value, and get test failures in REPL tests where different terminal color codes are output than expected.

There's all kinds of other ways, I'm sure, that different ipython_config.py settings could cause tests to fail.

Loading this file should be prevented when running the tests.  

It occurs to me now that this is the cause of some of the failures reported in #25361, since the Windows installer sets some specific defaults in ipython_config.py.

This is a slightly softer approach, for now, than completely disabling loading of `ipython_config.py`.  I realized that the `get_test_shell()` used in the tests does apply a default configuration to the options that are known to affect the tests.  However, it only applied this configuration to the `InteractiveShell` class, and not to its subclass `TerminalInteractiveShell`.

Applying the default config to `TerminalInteractiveShell` as well fixes the immediate problems I was seeing so this is good-enough for now.
