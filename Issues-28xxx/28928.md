As reported on [sage release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/B8dQGh5-Zz8/Kh2Gxj5HBgAJ), there are problems with introspection using iMac, Mid 2015, macOS 10.14.6 Mojave, with sage build for Python 2. The report contains more examples, but probably fixing the following would be enough:

Samuel, I'm puzzled. On the one hand, you say that your Sage is build with Python 2. On the other hand, I see this:

So, it is `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3.7`, not `python2.7`. Is it perhaps the case that you upgraded from an old python-2 version to a python-3 version and didn't do `make distclean`?
