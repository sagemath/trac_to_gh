As reported on [sage release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/B8dQGh5-Zz8/Kh2Gxj5HBgAJ), there are problems with introspection using iMac, Mid 2015, macOS 10.14.6 Mojave, with sage build for Python 2.

So, it is `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3.7`, not `python2.7`. Is it perhaps the case that you upgraded from an old python-2 version to a python-3 version and didn't do `make distclean`?
