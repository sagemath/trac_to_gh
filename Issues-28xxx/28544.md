```
The current coercion models try to be smart with submodules and permutation subgroups. More precisely, given an ambient free module

```
sage: V = QQ^4
```
and two submodules

```
sage: U1 = V.submodule([[1,3,2,4]])
sage: U2 = V.submodule([[0,1,0,1], [2,0,-1,-1]])
```
binary `+` between `U1` and `U2` is allowed and belongs to the "smallest" possible submodule

```
sage: parent(U1.an_element() + U2.an_element())
Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 3 over Rational Field
User basis matrix:
[   1    0    0 -1/5]
[   0    1    0    1]
[   0    0    1  3/5]
```
The same holds for permutation groups

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: P1 = S.subgroup(['(1,2)', '(3,4)'])
sage: P2 = S.subgroup(['(3,4,5)'])
sage: parent(P1.an_element() * P2.an_element())
Permutation Group with generators [(3,4), (3,4,5), (1,2)]
```
In both examples above the coercion is commutative

```
sage: parent(U1.an_element() + U2.an_element()) is \
....: parent(U2.an_element() + U1.an_element())
True
sage: parent(P1.an_element() * P2.an_element()) is \
....: parent(P2.an_element() * P1.an_element())
True
```

Beyond the fact that computing this submodule is computationally expensive and most probably useless, it leads to the following non-commutativity when the two submodules are equal but not identical

```
sage: U1 = V.subspace([[1,2,3,4]])
sage: U2 = V.subspace([[1,2,3,4]])
False
sage: U1 is U2
False
sage: U1 == U2
True
sage: parent(U1.an_element() + U2.an_element()) is U1
True
sage: parent(U2.an_element() + U1.an_element()) is U2
True
```

The exact same problem is happening with permutation groups

```
sage: P1 = S.subgroup(['(3,4)', '(1,2,3)(4,5)'])
sage: P2 = S.subgroup(['(3,4)', '(1,2,3)(4,5)'])
sage: parent(P1.one() * P2.one()) is P1
True
sage: parent(P1.an_element() * P2.an_element()) is P1
True
sage: parent(P2.an_element() * P1.an_element()) is P2
True
```

There are at least two ways to solve the problem (that would also solve avoid the computation of the minimal parent)
1. make submodules facade (ie the elements would have parent the ambient module). This might not be desirable since the user might want to use something such as `p.conjugacy_class()` rather than `P.conjugacy_class(p)`.
2. when operation is performed between element of non-identical submodules, both elements are promoted to the ambient submodule

Note: I stumbled upon this while working on #28539 from which I suddenly obtained some

<a id='comment:2'></a>In principle I agree with you that submodules are bad parents for elements when the ambient is nice and they are represented as ambient elements anyways. It means that one has to do tons of trivial coercions when calculating with elements different submodules.

Here are some thoughts in the case of modules:
- it seems to be a big design change to make submodules facades and break a lot of code. For instance the result of e.parent() will changes and probably that is used often. 
- over inexact rings does the element need to know its parent? is that a use case?
- the submodule is in general not contained in the ambient module, e.g. `span(ZZ,[vector([1/2,1])])`

I would be +1 for solution 1.

Fixing the issue is to my mind more important than breaking code.

> - over inexact rings does the element need to know its parent? is that a use case?


Submodules are just broken for inexact ring. I think we should just disallow (or redesign) them.

```
sage: V = VectorSpace(RDF,3)
sage: v1 = V([1.1, 2.3, 2.3**50])
sage: v2 = V([5.3**10, -1.1, 3.9])
sage: M = V.submodule([v1, v2])
sage: v1 in M
True
sage: v2 in M
False
```

> - the submodule is in general not contained in the ambient module, e.g. `span(ZZ,[vector([1/2,1])])`


This is not a submodule but a submodule of `V ⊗ 𝑸` (note that you explicitely used `span`). But you are right, the result of `span(ZZ, [vector([1/2,1])])` needs a proper parent.
