We consider below a path of 3 vertices. The two edges carry different labels. In particular it has no automorphism. Below bliss simply ignores the edge labels

```

sage: for algo in ['sage', 'bliss']:
....:     G = Graph([(0,1,2),(0,2,1)])
....:     H = Graph([(0,1,1),(1,2,2)])
....:     Gcan, Gmap = G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, certificate=True, algorithm=algo)
....:     Hcan, Hmap = H.canonical_label(edge_labels=True, certificate=True, algorithm=algo)
....:     print(sorted(Gcan.edges()) == sorted(Hcan.edges()))
True
False
```
(note: instead of comparing the sorted list of edges, one can alternatively set `weighted=True` in the constructors)

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
By default, `bliss` use edge labels, but it's true we must pass the parameter from method `canonical_label` of `generic_graph.py`.

My understanding of what is done with bliss is:
1. assign a unique id to each possible edge label. 
2. use method `bliss_graph_from_labelled_edges` to build a graph in which each label is modeled with a distinct gadget of vertices and edges.
3. compute the canonical form of this modified graph
4. extract edge labels corresponding to gadgets.

We have to check if these constructions are ok

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
There is a brief description page 60 of the documentation of `nauty` (http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/nug26.pdf).
Roughly, a label is a color. If we have `2^d-1` colors, we make a new graph with n*d vertices, d copies of the vertices, and a path connecting the copies of vertex u. Then, if we have edge `(u, v, id)` in the original graph, we take id in binary and add an edge between the ith copy of u and v for each bit of id set to 1.   Then the automorphism group of the original graph is the action of the automorphism of the new graph on the first copies of the vertices.

The code is not nice, but so far I don't see obvious error...

If we don't require the edge labels to form a total order I don't see how we can fix it.

I don't mind that it fails. The current code returns wrong answers in Python 2 which is much worse than failing.

I see two solutions:
- Store a universal list "all objects in Sage up to equality" -> "integers" which is nonsense. You seem to want that kind of feature in [comment:6](#comment%3A6).
- Use more or less what I wrote and specify in the function that canonical labels reaquires a total order on edge labels. I think it is better to raise an error when we detect that they are not. If the user has funny labels, she should provide a dictionary `labels -> integer` to the function. Inside `Graph.is_isomorphic` we can work around this issue easily since we have all labels in hand. In short
  - `is_isomorphic` will work as usual
  - `canonical_label` will work only if the edge labels can be totally sorted.

If solution 2 is acceptable to you I will polish the branch. If not I will add a stopgap to `canonical_label` when `edge_labels=True`.

To me it sounds that it would be less freedom since the computer will perform something that you might not want. It is much better to raise an error in case of doubt that the user can fix by providing the relevant mapping `edge label -> integer`.

No. One more bug.

Seems OK. A few comments.

```diff
         Pnr = len(partition)
-        for i in range(len(partition)):
+        for i in range(Pnr):
```
and in the else block right after, no need to set `Pnr = 1` (not used).

in `bliss_digraph_from_labelled_edges`, you could do the same modification as in `bliss_graph_from_labelled_edges` for the `# vertex partition gives colors` block, no ?

in `canonical_form`

```diff
     else:
-        for x,y,lab in G.edge_iterator(labels=True):
+        for x,y in G.edge_iterator(labels=False):
```
