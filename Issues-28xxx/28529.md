File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 1164, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial._cache_key
Failed example:

Expected:

Got:
    x
```

Hmmm, so if I understand right, a p-adic polynomial `f` that prints as `(1 + O(2^20))*x` satisfies `f.is_gen()`. Is that intentional?
