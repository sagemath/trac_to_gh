File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 1164, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial._cache_key
Failed example:
    foo(x)
Expected:
    (1 + O(2^20))*x
Got:
    x
```

Hmmm, so if I understand right, a p-adic polynomial `f` that prints as `(1 + O(2^20))*x` satisfies `f.is_gen()`. Is that intentional?

To make it a little bit faster. I'm not sure I understand the question, sorry. And I don't remember the details, but I think it had to do with the cost of going through an fmpz vs an mpz.

I assume you are talking about the code for evaluation at integers. There are timings in the commit message. I don't remember why I thought my version would be faster (it was a year ago...), but I suppose part of the explanation must be that `fmpq_poly_evaluate_mpz` does more or less the same conversions that my version is doing and requires temporary objects as well.

Can you also please add a comment about the p-adic line,

```
if self._is_gen and not isinstance(self._parent._base, pAdicGeneric)
```

Otherwise that's going to look very mysterious out of context.
