Tentative implementation for Minkowski's question mark function:

```
def mqm(x):
    r"""
    Minkowski's question-mark function.

    Reference: :wikipedia:`Minkowski's_question-mark_function`.
    """
    c = list(continued_fraction(x)[:30])
    res = c[0]
    aa = c[1:]
    s = 2.
    for a in aa:
        s = (-s) >> a
        res -= s
    return res
```
and for Conway's box function:

```
def box(x):
    r"""
    Conway's box function.

    Reference: :wikipedia:`Minkowski's_question-mark_function`.
    """
    aa = [floor(x)]
    s = (RR(x - aa[0])/2).str(base=2)[2:]
    if 'e-' in s:
        s, e = s.split('e-')
        s = '0' * (int(e)-1) + '1' + s
    y = [int(i) for i in s]
    d = 1
    while y and any(y):
        try:
            a = y.index(d)
        except ValueError:
            a = len(y)
        aa.append(a)
        y = y[a:]
        d = 1 - d
    return RR(continued_fraction(aa))
```
Plots of these two functions and their compositions:

```
plots = [
    plot(lambda x: mqm(x), (0, 1), aspect_ratio=1),
    plot(lambda x: box(x), (0, 1), aspect_ratio=1),
    plot(lambda x: mqm(box(x)), (0, 1), aspect_ratio=1),
    plot(lambda x: box(mqm(x)), (0, 1), aspect_ratio=1),
]
graphics_array(plots, ncols=2)
```
