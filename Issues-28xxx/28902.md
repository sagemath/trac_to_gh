```
and Sage:

```
sage: from sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive import HypergeometricData as HG
sage: H = HG(cyclotomic=[[3],[4]])
sage: time H.euler_factor(2, 1000003)
Wall time: 1min 5s
1000003*T^2 - 788*T + 1
sage: H = HG(cyclotomic=[[10],[5]])
sage: time H.euler_factor(2, 1009)
Wall time: 49 s
1018081*T^4 + 8072*T^3 + 590*T^2 + 8*T + 1
sage: H = HG(cyclotomic=[[10,6],[5,4]])
sage: time H.euler_factor(2, 61)
Wall time: 14.8 s
11694146092834141*T^6 - 14271143697997*T^5 - 13901224364*T^4 + 104106138*T^3 - 61244*T^2 - 277*T + 1
```
by moving two bottleneck steps into Cython.

- Computing Gauss sums via the Gross-Koblitz formula, in the `gauss_table` function in `rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx`.
  - We refactor Sage's implementation of the p-adic Gamma function to expose some internals as C functions.
  - When possible, we do the p-adic computations using C longs.
  - We short-circuit the computation when the working precision equals 1. This benefits the case of a degree-2 L-function.
  - We enable global caching of the Gauss sums, as in Magma's `HypergeometricMotiveSaveLimit` function.
- Computing products of Gauss sums needed for the hypergeometric trace formula, in the `hgm_coeffs` function in `modular/hypergeometric_misc.pyx`.
  - We again use C longs when possible.

<a id='comment:4'></a>In this commit, I moved the evaluation of the Mahler series for `p`-adic Gamma into a helper cdef function; this eliminates some Python call overhead. As a bonus, I can undo the change in call syntax to `dwork_expansion` and thereby restore backward compatibility.

I also made some additional optimizations in the case where the working precision is 1, as in the first of my examples.

Finally, I moved the precomputation of the Mahler series into `padics/misc.py`. This seems like a step backward since that is not a Cython file, but conceptually it seemed to make sense, and it doesn't have much effect on the timings.

With this commit, the timings are down to 9.15s, 11s, 3.81s. Some cleanup and doctests still needed.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This batch of commits implements a speedup to `hgm_coeffs`: it turns out that some of the coefficients are forced to be zero for combinatorial reasons, and it is helpful to order the computation so that this vanishing can be detected for an early abort. The relevance of this will vary with the hypergeometric data.

For the examples I am testing, the latest timings are 5.48s, 7.81s, 2.77s.

I also added doctests to restore 100% coverage in the affected files.

<a id='comment:25'></a>If we're going to use an array of long longs, I think it makes more sense to use a Python array (which is almost as efficient) so that we can send it directly from one subroutine to the other without conversion to a Python list. 

Besides making that change, I also found an overflow bug that I had introduced in this branch and added a doctest for it.

Timings for my three examples are now 2.0s, 3.4s, 2.9s. In particular we are now beating Magma in all of these cases (though they are far from exhaustive).

I also enabled the use of the long-based code when cacheing, which wasn't happening before. Not that this makes any appreciable difference when cacheing, but I wanted my LMFDB test run to stress-test this modification.

Patchbots seem satisfied with the earlier versions, but maybe it's worth waiting to see some runs from this latest commit.
