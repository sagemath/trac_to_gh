The docstring of `plot.colors.float_to_integer` says the output is "an integer with encoding `256^2 r + 256 g + b`", but this is incorrect (or misleading, or I was confused, at least) because the formula is not applied until after `r`, `g`, and `b` are converted from real numbers in the interval `[0.0, 1.0]` to integers in `range(256)`. The same is true of the function `Color.__int__`, which is a wrapper for `float_to_integer`.

I will upload a PR to fix the docstrings.
