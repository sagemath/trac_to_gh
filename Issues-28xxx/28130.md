I've found such camera views useful in the past for comparing the sizes of near and far objects in 3D scenes, and I recently found myself wanting to do something similar when plotting in Sage, so I took a stab at implementing it. I hope my changes prove useful to others.

Please let me know if you have further suggestions or encounter any problems, and I'd be happy to look into addressing them. Thank you for your time reviewing this MR.

Thanks Joshua. Looks good!

At some point we'll want to add additional enhancements like specifying materials and lighting. Since you clearly are familiar with Three.js, feel free to think about ways to implement such options.

In my experience, after a major change like this it's good to wait until it is merged in an upcoming beta and then work off the most current development branch. That avoids merge conflicts and speeds the build process for the reviewer.
