The following code should produce 1/x:

```
cr = function("cr", nargs=1)
R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
f = 1/cr(0)
f.substitute_function(cr, lambda w: x)
```

Instead it produces ValueError: exponent must be a rational number.

This doesn't happen if e.g. R is a (Laurent) *polynomial* ring instead.

version(): [SageMath](SageMath) version 8.8, Release Date: 2019-06-26
