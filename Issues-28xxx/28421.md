Currently, weighted term orders that are not given a tuple or a list as parameter behave strangely (and this causes confusion, cf [on Ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47628/weighted-univariate-polynomials/)ยน):

```python
sage: t = TermOrder('wdegrevlex', 2)
sage: t
Weighted degree reverse lexicographic term order
sage: t.is_weighted_degree_order()
False
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 1, order=t)
sage: x.degree()
1
```

In this ticket, we change the behavior as follows:

```python
sage: t = TermOrder('wdegrevlex', 2)
sage: t
Weighted degree reverse lexicographic term order with weights (2,)
sage: t.is_weighted_degree_order()
True
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 1, order=t)
sage: x.degree()
2
```

Note: Another possibility is to raise an Exception when an integer is given rather than a tuple/list. I think the proposed solution is more useful to the users.

ยน The Ask question uncovers two distinct problems, the second one is fixed in #28420.
