consider the following with Sage 8.8:

```
sage: R.<x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, z1, z2, z3, z4> = ZZ[]
sage: p = R.random_element(degree=10,terms=10^4)
sage: p.number_of_terms()
7983
sage: f = open("p.sage","w")
sage: f.write("p="+str(p)+"\n")
sage: f.close()
sage: t = cputime()
sage: load("p.sage")
sage: cputime()-t
3.1715750000000185
sage: q = R.random_element(degree=10,terms=2*10^4)
sage: q.number_of_terms()
16055
sage: f = open("q.sage","w")
sage: f.write("q="+str(q)+"\n")
sage: f.close()
sage: t = cputime()
sage: load("q.sage")
sage: cputime()-t
14.55525400000002
```
We see that for a polynomial that is almost twice as large, the time to read the file is multiplied by a factor larger than 4! This makes it impossible to work with very large files.

I'm not sure there's much we can do about it via this route, since the semantics of python prescribe that `a1+a2+a3+a4` gets evaluated as `((a1+a2)+a3)+a4`, which, due to the creation of intermediate results, should be quadratic in the number of terms [note that you're really just writing a python expression to a file and evaluating that] You could explicitly write your expression in balanced form to avoid this problem:

```
def balanced_str(p):
  return balanced_sum([c*t for c,t in list(p)])
def balanced_sum(L):
  if len(L) <= 4:
    return "+".join([str(a) for a in L])
  else:
    n= len(L) // 2
    return "(%s)+(%s)"%(balanced_sum(L[:n]),balanced_sum(L[n:]))
```
We can test this with some of your polynomials:

```
sage: Ps=[R.random_element(degree=10,terms=2^i*10^4) for i in [0..2]]
sage: Ss=[balanced_str(p) for p in Ps]
sage: %time _=R(Ss[0])
CPU times: user 139 ms, sys: 7.03 ms, total: 146 ms
Wall time: 143 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ss[1])
CPU times: user 245 ms, sys: 22 ms, total: 267 ms
Wall time: 262 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ss[2])
CPU times: user 487 ms, sys: 42.1 ms, total: 529 ms
Wall time: 519 ms
```
A little more worrisome is that for converting dictionary representation back into polynomials, the same quadratic behaviour occurs:

```
sage: Ds=[p.dict() for p in Ps]
sage: %time _=R(Ds[0])
CPU times: user 195 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 195 ms
Wall time: 196 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ds[1])
CPU times: user 863 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 863 ms
Wall time: 864 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ds[2])
CPU times: user 3.7 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.7 s
Wall time: 3.7 s
```
That's rather hard to defend. That should definitely be fixed. Constructing a polynomial from a dictionary representation should be one of the fastest ways of constructing a polynomial.

For the dict we should do something along the lines of:

```
def dicttopol(R,d):
    L=[R({c:m}) for (c,m) in d.iteritems()]
    j=0
    for i in range(len(L)-1,0,-1):
        j = (j-1) if j>0 else i//2 #using just j=i//2 already works well
        L[j]+=L.pop()
    return L[0]
```
with examples of the type above, we already get:

```
sage: %time _=dicttopol(R,Ds[0])
CPU times: user 91 ms, sys: 1.31 ms, total: 92.3 ms
Wall time: 83.6 ms
sage: %time _=dicttopol(R,Ds[1])
CPU times: user 162 ms, sys: 10.3 ms, total: 172 ms
Wall time: 158 ms
sage: %time _=dicttopol(R,Ds[2])
CPU times: user 337 ms, sys: 7.83 ms, total: 344 ms
Wall time: 317 ms
```
the actual code there should probably allocate an array of pointers to directly hold the libsingular terms so that we can avoid the overhead of the python wrappers. Balanced summation should actually be used in loads of places for polynomials.

With that in place, the advice for saving a polynomial in text form would then basically be: save the dict representation instead. Creating dicts from strings seems roughly linear.

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A3):
> maybe Sage could provide a method to save polynomials in a file, so that we can read them back efficiently (as balanced expressions, or dicts, ...)

Pickling already uses dicts, so if we improve that, "sobj" loading/saving would do that (since polynomials do get pickled via their dictionary representation). The test to do would be

```
pcl=[dumps(p) for p in Ps]
%time _=loads(pcl[0]) 
%time _=loads(pcl[1]) 
%time _=loads(pcl[2]) 
```
(which shows the same behaviour as reconstructing polynomials from dicts).

Improving reconstruction from dict will improve the loading of already existing pickles.

Note that we once again see that we should try quite hard to keep backwards compatibility for pickles, because obvious alternatives (like saving text representatives) simple don't perform reasonably.

First try. With this branch I get:

```
sage: R.<x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, z1, z2, z3, z4> = ZZ[]
sage: Ps=[R.random_element(degree=10,terms=2^i*10^4) for i in [0..2]]
sage: Ds=[p.dict() for p in Ps]
sage: %time _=R(Ds[0])
CPU times: user 36.8 ms, sys: 18 µs, total: 36.8 ms
Wall time: 37.1 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ds[1])
CPU times: user 81.7 ms, sys: 997 µs, total: 82.7 ms
Wall time: 83.1 ms
sage: %time _=R(Ds[2])
CPU times: user 132 ms, sys: 2.98 ms, total: 135 ms
Wall time: 136 ms
```

so that's nice behaviour. Unfortunately, for pickle it doesn't work yet:

```
sage: pickles=[dumps(p) for p in Ps]
sage: %timeit _=loads(pickles[0])
1 loop, best of 3: 193 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _=loads(pickles[1])
1 loop, best of 3: 920 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _=loads(pickles[2])
1 loop, best of 3: 3.92 s per loop
```
that's because pickle doesn't actually go via dicts but via polydicts. That's another case in the `_element_constructor_` method, and can be changed in exactly the same way.

First someone with knowledge of libsingular should have a look at the code to see if it can be written simpler/better (it's a little idiotic to use "add" when it's really just "append term")

I get a nice speedup. Here is what I got with Sage 8.8 for the last 10 loops:

```
5 loops, best of 3: 41.8 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 71.6 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 80.8 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 70.7 ms per loop

5 loops, best of 3: 104 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 68.7 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 117 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 132 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 146 ms per loop
```
With the new code:

```
125 loops, best of 3: 6.53 ms per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 7.1 ms per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 6.91 ms per loop

Thanks. The contentious data is for the first few loops. For the first 15 I get:
reference:

```
1000 loops, best of 10: 9.04 μs per loop
1000 loops, best of 10: 12.7 μs per loop
1000 loops, best of 10: 17.2 μs per loop

With patch:

<a id='comment:22'>Comment 22:</a>
FWIW, evaluation of large arithmetic expressions can be quite problematic in Python.  You already wrote about that somewhat in this ticket, but it's something I also started to explore several years ago, and *started* to write about [in my blog](https://iguananaut.net/blog/programming/python-polynomials-parsers-1.html) but then got sidetracked and never wrote the follow-up.

Actually the source of the segfault I mention there has now been fixed in CPython--the same example will still crash but the Python interpreter raises a `RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` exception instead of segfaulting.

My practical conclusion was that the Sage preparser should do some of its own pre-parsing of polynomial expressions to avoid evaluating them as Python expressions.
