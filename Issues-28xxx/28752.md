The goal of this ticket is to make sagelib (i.e., subdirectory `SAGEROOT/src`) pip-installable when all required packages are provided by the conda distribution -- just through `SAGEROOT/src/setup.py` and completely bypassing all sage-the-distribution scripts (top-level `SAGEROOT/Makefile` and `SAGEROOT/build`.

In Sage 9.2, this already works after `./configure`.

Tickets merged in Sage 9.2 or earlier:

* #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin
* #21569: Install `src/bin/*` scripts via `setup.py` (`scripts`, `console_scripts`)
* #21785: Installation of `SAGE_SRC/ext/` in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/` should be done by `setup.py`, not `build/make/Makefile`

Additional steps for Sage 9.3:

* #28745: Add `SAGEROOT/src/environment.yml` - describes all conda packages needed for installing sagelib for doing sagelib development (this is a superset of `SAGEROOT/environment.yml`, also introduced in #28745)
* #30845 GH Actions: Add test for conda without SPKG
* #29850 Install `sage-env-config` as part of `sage_conf`; make `sage-env-config` optional
* #21707: Meta-ticket: Split `sage-env` into 5 to clean up sage configuration

Optional steps:
* #21570: Move non-scripts of `src/bin/` elsewhere (and also move their install location)
* #21573: Make sure src/setup.py respects --install-base and --root
* #21654: `src/setup.py`: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory
* #21678: Testsuite for `src/setup.py`
* #22655: Support `package_data`-like of non-Python resource files in Python packages
* #23747: Rename `SAGE_ROOT/build` to `SAGE_ROOT/sage-distro`, `SAGE_ROOT/src` to `SAGE_ROOT/sagelib`

(see also earlier task ticket #21507: Make sagelib a pip-installable Python source package, listed on PyPI.)

Depends on #28745

 The goal of this ticket is to make sagelib (i.e., subdirectory `SAGEROOT/src`) pip-installable when all required packages are provided by the conda distribution -- just through `SAGEROOT/src/setup.py` and completely bypassing all sage-the-distribution scripts (top-level `SAGEROOT/Makefile` and `SAGEROOT/build`.
 
-* #28745: Add `SAGEROOT/src/environment.yml` - describes all conda packages needed for installing sagelib for doing sagelib development (this is a superset of `SAGEROOT/environment.yml`, also introduced in #28745)
+In Sage 9.2, this already works after `./configure`.
+
+Tickets merged in Sage 9.2 or earlier:
+
+* #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin
 * #21569: Install `src/bin/*` scripts via `setup.py` (`scripts`, `console_scripts`)
 * #21785: Installation of `SAGE_SRC/ext/` in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/` should be done by `setup.py`, not `build/make/Makefile`
+
+Additional steps for Sage 9.3:
+
+* #28745: Add `SAGEROOT/src/environment.yml` - describes all conda packages needed for installing sagelib for doing sagelib development (this is a superset of `SAGEROOT/environment.yml`, also introduced in #28745)
 * #29850 Install `sage-env-config` as part of `sage_conf`; make `sage-env-config` optional
+* #21707: Meta-ticket: Split `sage-env` into 5 to clean up sage configuration
 
 Optional steps:
-* #25828: Move `OptionalExtension` to `features
-* #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin
 * #21570: Move non-scripts of `src/bin/` elsewhere (and also move their install location)
 * #21573: Make sure src/setup.py respects --install-base and --root
 * #21654: `src/setup.py`: Disentangle cleaning of stale installed files in build directory and in install directory
 * #21678: Testsuite for `src/setup.py`
-* #21707: Split `sage-env` into `sage-build-env` and `sage-env`
 * #22655: Support `package_data`-like of non-Python resource files in Python packages
 * #23747: Rename `SAGE_ROOT/build` to `SAGE_ROOT/sage-distro`, `SAGE_ROOT/src` to `SAGE_ROOT/sagelib`
 * #21516: Fix sagelib sdist (src/setup.py sdist)
