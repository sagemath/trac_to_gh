As #28106 demonstrates, although it is perhaps a somewhat extreme case, constructing large classes of tableaux can be very memory-hungry, as the `StandardTableaux(50)` case demonstrates (it chews up nearly a gigabyte of RAM).

In many cases, most individual tableaux can be represented as a single flat numpy array of small ints (8-bit unsigned for example) containing their shape data, which would save significant space.  Having tableaux stored as Numpy arrays may also help speed up some algorithms, but I'm not sure about any specific cases.

Thanks for the update. The plan was to use ClonableArray's / IntArrays. Numpy arrays could be an alternative indeed.

I wondered if maybe that was a possibility as well, but 8-bit numpy arrays would still probably be the most efficient.

I figured it was probably considered before but I didn't see a ticket for it.
