Sage provides two functions `identity_matrix`
and `diagonal_matrix` in the global namespace.

By contrast, matrix spaces have an `identity_matrix`
method but no `diagonal_matrix` method.

Global namespace functions:

```
sage: identity_matrix(ZZ, 2)
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: diagonal_matrix(ZZ, [3, 2])
[3 0]
[0 2]
```

Matrix space methods:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: M.identity_matrix()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

Before this ticket:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: M.diagonal_matrix([3, 2])
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'MatrixSpace_with_category' object has no attribute 'diagonal_matrix'
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: M.diagonal_matrix([3, 2])
[3 0]
[0 2]
```


Keywords: diagonal matrix, beginner

<a id='comment:3'></a>I added a `diagonal_matrix` method in `matrix_space.py` pointing it to the original `diagonal_matrix` method in `special.py`.

So, I tried to think of reasons why we would be using `matrix_space` methods instead of the regular `matrix()` methods (crosspost: https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3537612/287775) but couldn't find any.

Are there practical reasons, so that I can write better code for this file now/ in the future?

Also would like a review on this patch.

The above discussion thread suggested to model diagonal_matrix on the identity_matrix function. Since that was immutable by default, I made it so in diagonal_matrix as well. I'll remove it if required. I've now made a change that keeps the implementation method the same in the diagonal matrix. Please review.

<a id='comment:14'></a>The `identity_matrix` is immutable because it is cached. If it were not immutable, this could happen:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: a = M.identity_matrix()
sage: a[0,0] = 2
sage: M.identity_matrix()
[2 0]
[0 1]
```
This is not an issue with `diagonal_matrix`, and I don't see a good reason for it to be immutable.

<a id='comment:19'></a>I made a few changes:

- edited the docstring so that there is an "INPUTS" block and so that the lines are under 80 characters.
- added a doctest showing what happens if you try to create a diagonal matrix with entries from the wrong ring
- removed the alias `diag`: I think `diagonal_matrix` is completely clear, whereas `diag` is ambiguous. People can easily get `diagonal_matrix` using tab-completion, so I'm not concerned about the extra characters.

If you are happy with these changes, feel free to set to positive review. Make sure to add your real name to the "Authors" field.

Hey `@`vbraun, thanks for the pointer. I'm new to contributing to sage and this makes me realise I should run all the doctests before sending PRs. Just a clarification, should I also run the "long" tests?

Also, regarding this change, clearly, the error is because I added a new function so the number of expected functions should increase by one. I can make the change in the test file and send it if that's what is required. However, I tried rebasing with current develop branch and then running the doc test and this gives expected and got values different:

```
Failed example:
    len([s for s in dir(MS1) if inspect.ismethod(getattr(MS1,s,None))])
Expected:
    81
Got:
    83

Should I change the doctest before or after rebase?
