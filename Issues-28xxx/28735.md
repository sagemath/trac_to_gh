Keywords: lattice polytopes, facets

Currently, the facets of lattice polytopes are obtained from the face lattice. This is somewhat slow, but most importantly this is a problem for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, which uses the method `facets` to obtain the combinatorial structure. So `CombinatorialPolyhedron` cannot be be used for computing the face lattice of lattice polytopes.

Solution: We won't fix this. Instead #28960 initializes `CombinatorialPolyhedron` from (a new method) `incidence_matrix`. This implicitely uses `facet_normals` instead of facets. This why `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is independent of the face lattice computation.

While it certainly makes sense, some things should be addressed:
1. Caching of facets - while the existing code computes more than necessary, it does it once and on the second invocation nothing is computed at all, plus all the properties of the facets (like lattice point count) are cached as well.
2. Face lattice methods - is it still possible with this change to ask for neighbours of a facet or its own facets and get the same results as before? I have doubts about it as it relied on facets being elements of a poset.
3. Sorting in low-dimensional cases - there is care the in the existing code to have consistent order of vertices and 0-dimensional faces, as well as facet normals and facets. And sometimes these coinside. Will the new code preserve the order?

As a possible easy solution - facets may take some argument like ``from_lattice=True`` which will trigger full lattice computation when ``True`` (default) and when ``False`` it will check if lattice is already computed (in which case there is no harm in using it) and if not - use the suggested code.

Sure.

It seems to still work:

```
sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(5)
sage: f = o.facets()[0]
sage: f.facet_of()
(5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,)
sage: L = o.face_lattice()
sage: D = L.hasse_diagram()
sage: D.neighbors(f)
[3-d face of 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,
 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,
 3-d face of 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,
 3-d face of 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,
 3-d face of 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,
 3-d face of 5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M]
sage: f.facet_of()
(5-d reflexive polytope in 5-d lattice M,)
sage: 
```
Nevertheless, I adopted `face_lattice` to return exactly the facets in codimension 1.

I also changed my could to only be applied, when `self is self.ambient()`.

My facets should be in exactly the same order, as they used to be, as I just took the code from `face_lattice`. They are also in the same order as the normals. So anything else would be very strange. Wouldn't it?

Eventually, it makes sense to cache the hasse diagram instead of the `FiniteLatticePoset`. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/UuSDdN9QC3M/i2Uzp2SzEAAJ](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/UuSDdN9QC3M/i2Uzp2SzEAAJ).

Actually, I think I'm going to change the design a bit.

- Make `LPFace` a method of the lattice polytope (cached), which
  - if `self.ambient() is self` works as it is
  - otherwise transform the indices to ambient indices (using cached dictionaries) and then call `LPFace` of ambient

This way one can obtain facets directly from any lattice polytope. This will also allow to obtain faces directly from an interator instead of from the face lattice.

Ok, I keep that in mind.

A few sentences about my motivation:

I mainly just wanted to compute the face lattice by `CombinatorialPolyhedron`. However, it doesn't make any sense to initialize it from the facets, which are in turn taken from the face lattice.

One intermediate step, is to create the incidence matrix (#28743). This is implicitly done for the face lattice anyway. (Actually one can obtain the combinatorial polyhedron instead from the incidence matrix.)

Maybe I just replace face lattice (in the `self is self.ambient()` case) and leave everything else the way it is.

To avoid memory leak, it makes also sense to cache the hasse diagram/digraph instead of `FiniteLatticePoset` (I was told that this is cached anyway). As it looks, many methods can then just call the hasse diagram directly.
