Currently, if `x` is a p-adic number indistingushable from 0, the call `x.denominator()` raises an error. IMNO, it is not justified (and not convenient at all).

Instead, I propose to let it return `p^n` where `n` is the smallest integer for which we have the guarantee that `p^n*x` is integral, i.e. is `O(p^N)` with `N` nonnegative.
