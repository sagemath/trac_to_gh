ok, so in barvinok-config one sees 

```
2415	configure:14457: gcc -o conftest -g -O2    -L/opt/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/sage/local/lib  conftest.c -lntl  -lgmp  >&5
2416	/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.1.0/../../../../lib/libntl.so: undefined reference to `pthread_key_create'
2417	/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.1.0/../../../../lib/libntl.so: undefined reference to `pthread_setspecific'
2418	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```
which is why it does not build.

Could you post the output of 

```
ldd /usr/lib/libntl.so
```
it seems it's multi-threaded on Arch?

Without `barvinok`, did you run tests for this installation of Sage?
If everything works (I hope so), we should fix the configure of `barvinok`, or perhaps just its `spkg-install`. (It seems it needs to be linked with `-lpthread` as well).

It could also be that `libntl` is underlinked on Arch...

Yes, this is a bug in ntl, which fails to link to libpthread when built with multi-thread support. It is caused by them using libtool as the build command, which adds -nostdlib to the gcc flags, which in turn overrides the -pthread flag.

I reported this to Victor a long time ago (by private mail since he doesn't use a bug tracker) but hasn't been fixed yet. For a while I was linking it manually as a workaround but I stopped doing it a few releases ago since all official Arch packages that link to ntl were working fine - but this seems to be simply because they link to libpthread themselves so the issue was just being masked.

I've restored the workaroung for now, so this should be fixed on Arch with ntl 11.3.2-2. But it will affect all distros that build ntl multi-threaded unless they apply a similar workaround.
