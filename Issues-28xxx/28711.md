This is a reformulation of the ticket summary, after some discussion went on.

p_group_cohomology is divided into four parts:
- a C-library libmodres (autotoolized), also providing a data base.
- a pip-installable collection of Python / Cython modules
- some files containing GAP code (let's call it GAP helper module)
- a documentation using sphinx

Problem: Some of the modules refer to SAGE_LOCAL at installation or at run time, respectively. Moreover, the GAP helper module is currently installed into SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage, which has been removed.

Issues of each part:
- The C-library seems totally fine. One could consider to turn it into a stand-alone spkg.
- The Python / Cython modules seem mostly fine. Problems: 
  - Its setup.py takes the job of installing the GAP helper module, in a folder whose location is determined from the value of SAGE_LOCAL and which actually doesn't exist any longer.
  - Some Python module makes GAP read the GAP helper module, thus also determines the import location from the value of SAGE_LOCAL.
  Proposed solution:
  - It shouldn't be the job of setup.py to install the GAP helper module.
  - It should be possible for GAP to load the helper module without explicitly constructing a path derived from SAGE_LOCAL.
  Side remark: It would be possible to move the Python / Cython modules into Sage's src tree, but that would created issues with testing and documentation.
- The files containing GAP code are not intended to be a proper GAP module, but should perhaps behave like a proper GAP module. A more or less clean solution would be to put it into GAP's pkg folder such that it can be loaded by `LoadPackage("pGroupCohomologyHelpers");`. Problem: How to determine GAP's pkg folder at installation time without referring to SAGE_LOCAL?
- Documentation is built using `$MAKE html` and then copied. It was suggested to replace `cp -r` by `sdh_install`.

On the other ticket, Dima stated:

///

IMHO, Python wheels are build to be relocateable, so it's futile to try to install GAP data via setup.py. I'd say, install a GAP package separately, not from setup.py from spkg-install. By the way, GAP now has its own package manager. Maybe you can use it (​https://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager) - it's in gap_packages, I think. 

///

So, I'll have a look at it.

Question: When using GAP's package manager, it would probably be possible to do it in the setup.py, using libgap. Should I keep it there, or is it cleaner to move installation of GAP code to spkg-install?

I am unhappy, because I don't see a good solution for the installation problems of the GAP parts of the spkg.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE:
- A couple of .g files, containing function definitions.

CURRENT APPROACH:
- Install the files into $SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/
- Let setup.py do the installation

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- As reported on #30349, Sage totally messes up the path. Note that I have never seen that problem, myself.
- It is argued that installation of the .g files should be done in spkg-install, not in setup.py.

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
- Put the files somewhere else, such as $SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap/pkg/
- Let spkg-install do the installation, perhaps via some GAP tool

PROBLEM WITH THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
- I don't consider the couple of .g files a "package" for GAP.
- Potential GAP tools seem to be not part of the gap_packages spkg. Thus, aren't readily available in Sage.

So, I believe the current approach is just fine: We need a place for some GAP readable files, that logically belong to a Sage package (p_group_cohomology) but can hardly be seen a stand-alone GAP package. Thus, some place in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap seems just right to me.

Only we need to understand why, according to #30349, Sage puts stuff into $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3.7/site-packages/$SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/, although setup.py clearly states, `data_files=[(os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE,"sage","ext","gap","modular_cohomology")`.

Argh. Sounds like a lot of work.

Problems:
- Where to install the data base? It used to be put into SAGE_SHARE. Is it still fine?
- Do we put the Python and Cython files into SAGE_SRC? Then:
  - Is it really ok to have a Python file float around that cannot be imported unless some optional package is installed?

The problem I have with that depends on the definition of "can", when you say it "can" independently be used. I believe splitting `modular_resolution` off makes no sense. If one uses `modular_resolution`, one would also use `p_group_cohomology`-

Wrong. The C library, that I inherited from David Green, makes intense use of meataxe, and is the only reason why I added meataxe as an optional spkg.

It should just be made sure that it is pip-installable into an arbitrary Python environment and does not try to use SAGE_LOCAL or SAGE_SHARE to determine installation locations.

That's what currently is the case. As you can see from spkg-install, installation of stuff is using pip.

The only question is where to install the data base, and where/how to install the .g files.

Concerning the data base: Currently the data base is installed when installing the C library `libmodres`. Requirements: It must be a location that is readable for all users of Sage; write permission is only needed during package installation. So, what I currently do in Makefile.am, namely

```
dbdir           = $(datadir)/pGroupCohomology
dist_db_DATA    = group_cohomology_database.tar
install-data-hook:
        cd $(DESTDIR)$(dbdir) && tar xf $(dist_db_DATA) && rm $(dist_db_DATA)

uninstall-hook:
        rm -r $(DESTDIR)$(dbdir)
```
should be the right thing to do, shouldn't it??

Concerning the .g files: If I understand correctly, many GAP packages are installed by just unpacking a .tar.gz into GAP's pkg/ folder. So, I could imagine to create a mock GAP package `pGroupCohomologyHelpers` ("Helpers" meaning that the package is not supposed to be of any use on its own), by creating a folder `/pGroupCohomologyHelpers` in GAP's `pkg/` folder, which contains a file `init.g`, that in turn reads the code from my current .g files (that perhaps should be renamed as .gap files).

Then, one could just do libgap.LoadPackage("pGroupCohomologyHelpers"), without the trouble to explicitly referring to the SAGE_LOCAL variable at run time.

The question is: How to locate GAP's `pkg/` folder at installation time, without messing around with SAGE_LOCAL? How can I make GAP reveal the location, using a shell command, so that spkg-install can install the .g files?

However, if I understand correctly, the current spkg-install script prevents this. The purpose of this ticket is to fix it.
+This is a reformulation of the ticket summary, after some discussion went on.
 
+p_group_cohomology is divided into four parts:
+- a C-library libmodres (autotoolized), also providing a data base.
+- a pip-installable collection of Python / Cython modules
+- some files containing GAP code (let's call it GAP helper module)

+Issues of each part:
+- The C-library seems totally fine. One could consider to turn it into a stand-alone spkg.
+- The Python / Cython modules seem mostly fine. Problems: 
+  - Its setup.py takes the job of installing the GAP helper module, in a folder whose location is determined from the value of SAGE_LOCAL and which actually doesn't exist any longer.
+  - Some Python module makes GAP read the GAP helper module, thus also determines the import location from the value of SAGE_LOCAL.
+  Proposed solution:
+  - It shouldn't be the job of setup.py to install the GAP helper module.

If so, then I think the two issues actually boil down to a single question: What syntax to use for sdh_install to let spkg-install put stuff in a sub-folder of DESTDIR?

oops, it's not in the current GAP 4.10 bundled with Sage, but it is in GAP 4.11 (#29314) - although 
now I see I didn't include it in #29314 - although it can be done.

Even if the package manager could be included, I think one should try to not make it a dependency.

*If* we agree that creating a !pGroupCohomologyHelpers module for GAP, being put into GAP's pkg/ folder, is a clean solution, and *if* ((GAP is able to tell the pkg/ folder's path) or (DESTDIR/share/gap/pkg is safe to use)), then we don't need GAP's package manager. sdh_install (as soon as someone gives me a pointer to its documentation) would be enough.

if you don't do this then you'd need to use GAP's `Read()` rather than `LoadPackage()` to load the
GAP files, and then you'd need to use the full path to the files.

One can try using https://github.com/gap-system/PackageMaker to generate the needed for a package boilerplate.



> and *if* ((GAP is able to tell the pkg/ folder's path) or (DESTDIR/share/gap/pkg is safe to use)), then we don't need GAP's package manager.

we can put `PackageManager` into `gap` rather than `gap_packages`, then it won't be a dependency.


> sdh_install (as soon as someone gives me a pointer to its documentation) would be enough.

see its source with comments in 
`build/bin/sage-dist-helpers`

(that's all the docs there are, ATM, I think)

Thank you!

It sounds like a lot of work to change the current code in the required format for a package.

I wonder what functions I'd need to declare as global functions. Currently, the code is split into several .g files: GapMaxels.g, GapMB.g, GapSgs.g. Suppose a function from GapMaxels is used in GapMB: Do I need to declare such function as global? And if a function from GapMB is used in another function of GapMB: Do I need to declare such function as global?

Is it really needed to make a full package (even if it is boiler plate)? My hope was that I can keep it simpler and that I wouldn't need to write separate documentation for David Green's GAP code.

EDIT: I cloned your github repository.

It says

```
# - sdh_install [-T] SRC [SRC...] DEST
#
#    Copies one or more files or directories given as SRC (recursively in the
#    case of directories) into the destination directory DEST, while ensuring
#    that DEST and all its parent directories exist.  DEST should be a path
#    under $SAGE_LOCAL, generally.  For DESTDIR installs the $SAGE_DESTDIR path
#    is automatically prepended to the destination.
#
#    The -T option treats DEST as a normal file instead (e.g. for copying a
#    file to a different filename).  All directory components are still created
#    in this case.
```

Does it mean that when one provide a path `os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE,"sage","ext","gap","modular_cohomology")` in setup.py, then $SAGE_DESTDIR would be prepended to this ABSOLUTE path??? It seems this is the exactly how the install path of my GAP files got messed up as reported in #30349!! I'll add a comment there.

I have created a fork and made the package actually usable. See https://github.com/simon-king-jena/p_group_cohomology_helper

In spkg-install, I currently have

```
# building modular_resolution
cd `ls -d modular_resolution*`
sdh_configure || sdh_die "Error configuring modular_resolution"
sdh_make || sdh_die "Error making modular_resolution"
# sdh_make install got broken by trac ticket #24106
$MAKE install || sdh_die "Error installing modular_resolution"

Has sdh_make_install been fixed? Is it enough to just do

```
# build and install modular_resolution
cd `ls -d modular_resolution*`
sdh_configure || sdh_die "Error configuring modular_resolution"
sdh_make_install || sdh_die "Error making modular_resolution"

`sdh_die` is called automatically by the other helper functions, so you don't need to call it yourself.

So, you say that MOST spkgs are currently broken, because they have all things like this in spkg-install?

```
sdh_install doc/ref doc/tut "$SAGE_SHARE/doc/gap/"
sdh_install -T src "${SAGE_SHARE}/jmol"

Just grep for SAGE_SHARE or SAGE_LOCAL in `$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs`.

What do you mean by "the C library package"? If you mean modular_resolution: This has never been related with installation of the GAP part of the package.

Anyway. In the branch that I am currently testing (not posted yet), it is the job of spkg-install to put the Singular and GAP helpers into the right places, `"$SAGE_SHARE/singular/LIB/"` or `"$SAGE_SHARE/gap/pkg/"`, using sdh_install.

Anything that `setup.py` builds, including extension modules, is fine.

Standalone libraries that would be installed in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ are not fine.

This is (I guess) the moment when pgroup.h is supposed to be installed:

```

When you say that an spkg shouldn't be formed by a python package and a non-python package, then you suggest to split p_group_cohomology.

Would the following be the right way to split the current p_group_cohomology spkg into three spkgs?
1. modular_resolution, depending on meataxe-the-C-library, that installs 
   - a standalone C library libmodres.so -- of course(!!) in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib, where else would a C library be installed?
   - some executables in $SAGE_LOCAL/bin, linked against libmodres
2. p_group_cohomology_helper, that installs
   - a GAP helper module in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap/pkg/
   - a Singular helper module in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/LIB/
   - a data base in $SAGE_LOCAL/share/p_group_cohomology/
3. p_group_cohomology, depending on meataxe-the-Cython-extension, that is pip-installable

The computation of cohomology rings needs all the above! So, when you seriously state that "Standalone libraries that would be installed in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ are not fine.", then you should tell what to do instead.

Perhaps; although it could also make sense to make them actually part of the pip-installable package -- in which case the install location would NOT be `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/...` but next to the Python modules (this would depend on setting some load paths for GAP or Singular so that the modules would be found, I suppose - but I do not know enough about these systems). In that case, the installation would be done using `setup.py`'s `package_data` or similar.

Yes.

... I meant here: for a Python package!

Non-Python packages, of course, will install in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Nice! Thank you! It now looks much better (at least when built manually).

Unfortunately there is a problem with [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/github/sagemath/p_group_cohomology).

Testing fails before it was even tried to install p_group_cohomology. Namely, it fails when doing "sage -b" after installing meataxe. The error is:

```
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.

The command "docker exec cohomology sage -b" failed and exited with 2 during .
```
Of course that command did work in the past.

Needless to say that #19225 doesn't clearly explain what to do in order to replace the ugly _no_generic_basering_coercion by something better. Should one simply remove it or what? And "of course" clicking on the branch of #19225 doesn't show a diff to the pre-#19225 state, i.e., I cannot infer from the changes in the code what I'd have to do now.

Hooray! After simply removing the hack that was deprecated by #19225, I get

```
[p_group_cohomology-3.3.2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------
[p_group_cohomology-3.3.2] All tests passed!
[p_group_cohomology-3.3.2] ----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
That was withoug #30151, though.

**Problems solved:**
- setup.py is not messing around with SAGE_LOCAL. Instead, stuff that needs to be installed relative to the root of the Sage installation is now put in place by spkg-install using sdh_install.
- The GAP part of the package has become a proper GAP package, that is installed where GAP expects packages (and can actually be loaded by `LoadPackage(...)`).
- A hack that has been deprecated in #19225 is removed.

**Remaining problems:**
1. Documentation does still not build correctly, although it can be built separately.
2. I'm not using #30151 yet. **Question**: Do I understand correctly that I need to change the dependencies of the ticket as follows?

  ```
  $(PYTHON) cython cysignals singular sage-meataxe $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/structure/element.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix0.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/libs/meataxe.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/rings/morphism.pxd | pip matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME)
   ```
   Or can this by simplified due to #30151?
3. The package consists of several sub-packages. One may consider to split them, perhaps even to put the python and cython parts into the Sage src tree, analogously to #30151.

Problem 2 should be addressed here. I suggest problems 1 and 3 will be tackled in two new tickets. Agreed?

When creating the release, github asked me for a tag, so, I added the tag v3.3.2 there.

Is that a problem? It is supposed to be the same tag on the same commit. But perhaps git considers it as "different history"?

No.

First of all, meataxe IS in dependencies:

```
$(PYTHON) cython cysignals singular meataxe $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/structure/element.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/matrix/matrix0.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/libs/meataxe.pxd $(SAGE_SRC)/sage/rings/morphism.pxd | pip matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME)
```

Secondly, installing meataxe is not enough, as it is required to do `sage -b` after installation. That's why there are the first two lines in spkg-install.in.

Nope, sdh_make_install is still broken. I tried, but it didn't work.

Whith

```
...
# build and install modular_resolution
cd `ls -d modular_resolution*`
sdh_configure
# sdh_make install got broken by trac ticket #24106
sdh_make_install
cd ..
...
```
I get :attachment:p_group_cohomology-3.3.2.log when first removing libmodres.* from SAGE_LOCAL/lib and modular_resolution from SAGE_LOCAL/include, then doing sage -f p_group_cohomology.

OK, what's happening here is that your package is not ready for the staged install because the "make install" of the C library goes to the staging directory, so the second step will not find it in `SAGE_LOCAL`.  

This is working as designed. The problem will go away if you split out modres as a separate spkg.

it is much better to upload a tarball produced on your machine, rather than rely on GitHub's produced tarballs, which are known to change overtime sometimes.

I don't understand the need for these. Yes, your package depends on sagelib as a whole, thus on these files too.

The tarball in SAGE_ROOT/upstream is bitwise identical with what I downloaded.

Anyway. If the checksums do not match, I suggest to clean things up. Namely, AFTER adding the tag "v3.3.2", I did a few changes in the index.rst file of the documentation. If I see that correctly, these changes are not part of the tarball that is posted on github.

Since the numbers do not match, I will now
- make sure to include my latest changes (to the documentation) in the release.
- move the tag v3.3.2 to the corresponding commit, both locally and on github.
- upload the release tarball on github
- change the checksum, if necessary.

I think the problem with the documentation is this: if you install the documentation in `spkg-install.in`, then the package hasn't been installed yet — it's in a staging area — so it cannot be imported into Python, which is necessary for the docbuilding process. So move the docbuilding stuff to `spkg-postinst.in`:

not sure how serious it is - if it's not, and you don't have time to fix it now, just mark it as a known error, and open another ticket.

Thank you for spotting this! Indeed I forgot that there are some doctests in the Sage src tree, and only tested the package's own test suite.

Hm. I'll have a closer look. Two cohomology rings should evaluate equal if the two ring representations are identical. This should be the case here, as there is an isomorphism mapping the generators one to one.

... unless there is a tail reduction of the relations in one case but not in the other case.

At least I'll have a look now.

I chose "equality of cohomology rings" to mean "equality of ring representations".

So, with this choice, one would have `1/2==2/4` if and only if `1/2` is represented in the same way (namely as a REDUCED fraction) as `2/4`.

Note that to check whether two ideals represent the same set of polynomials, one would need to compute Gröbner bases. But that's very expensive. Therefore, it was decided by Sage (at least in the past, I don't know if that has changed) to not do the expensive test, but to compare generators instead.

And that's what I do here, too.

> On the other hand what we have here is a stronger kind of equvalence than just a (graded) ring isomorphism, no?

Sure. I wrote a research paper (with Bettina Eick) on classifying the cohomology rings of groups of order <=81 up to graded isomorphism. And that's a totally different problem.

Here, equality is not "isomorphism of graded rings", but "identity of ring representations".
