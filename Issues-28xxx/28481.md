In support of the ring extension classes in #21413, we want to generalize the functionality of the `vector_space` method to free modules over other rings.  This ticket renames the method to `free_module` and implements it for p-adic extensions.

```
having extra methods via tab completion is a good thing, especially as they are all still applicable to the objects. That specific reason really is not a good argument for not doing that, but are there other side effects that cause problems?

Yep.

* If I add `ModulesWithBasis(Qp(5)).Finite()` as a base ring for `Qq(125)` I get errors on object creation.  It's not clear to me how much work it would be to address all the issues introduced by this change, and I'm not interested in doing so at the moment when I have higher priority things to work on.
* The `dimension()` method of the `ModulesWithBasis` category doesn't take a base field.  Two-step extensions are vector spaces both over their base field and over `Qp`; I don't think it would be possible to have both.  But #21413 is exactly about creating relative extensions where we need to work with different base fields.

Thanks for the explanations. Do you think you could change the above comment to state one of them you gave? Once done, then positive review.

No problem. It is something beyond the current ticket and not important for your applications. It is something I could look into too when I have more time as well.

Two-step extensions are vector spaces both over their base field and over `Qp`; I don't think it would be possible to have both.  But #21413 is exactly about creating relative extensions where we need to work with different base fields.


In the mathematical sense, the category stores this information (i.e., it is an R-module, so it returns the dimension as an R-module), although we have partially removed this information. However, that is a bit tangential to this issue. I don't know the code, but your implementation of `dimension` should be overriding that. If instead it something coming from the two categories, then you will unfortunately just need to make it explicit somewhere. Or we just add that as an optional argument to the `ModulesWithBasis` category that is generally ignored as it is something that makes sense for all objects in that category. However, this should be done on a later ticket.
