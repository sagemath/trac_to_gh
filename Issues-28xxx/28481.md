In support of the ring extension classes in #21413, we want to generalize the functionality of the `vector_space` method to free modules over other rings.  This ticket renames the method to `free_module` and implements it for p-adic extensions.

The `free_module` in `padic_extension_generic.py` does not have any doctests.

About this comment

```
# We could have used morphisms in the category
# FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis over Qp(p)

```
having extra methods via tab completion is a good thing, especially as they are all still applicable to the objects. That specific reason really is not a good argument for not doing that, but are there other side effects that cause problems?

It's not clear to me how much work it would be to address all the issues introduced by this change, and I'm not interested in doing so at the moment when I have higher priority things to work on.\n* The `dimension()` method of the `ModulesWithBasis` category doesn't take a base field.  Two-step extensions are vector spaces both over their base field and over `Qp`; I don't think it would be possible to have both.

Yep.

* If I add `ModulesWithBasis(Qp(5)).Finite()` as a base ring for `Qq(125)` I get errors on object creation.  It's not clear to me how much work it would be to address all the issues introduced by this change, and I'm not interested in doing so at the moment when I have higher priority things to work on.
* The `dimension()` method of the `ModulesWithBasis` category doesn't take a base field.  Two-step extensions are vector spaces both over their base field and over `Qp`; I don't think it would be possible to have both.  But #21413 is exactly about creating relative extensions where we need to work with different base fields.

I'm not sure that checking equality with `rich_to_bool(op,0)` will always work.

In the doctest of the `_call_` method in the class `MapOneStepToFreeModule`, the variable `a` is used two times with a different meaning.
