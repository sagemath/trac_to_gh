In support of the ring extension classes in #21413, we want to generalize the functionality of the `vector_space` method to free modules over other rings.  This ticket renames the method to `free_module` and implements it for p-adic extensions.

The `free_module` in `padic_extension_generic.py` does not have any doctests.

About this comment

```
# We could have used morphisms in the category
# FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis over Qp(p)
# But this would require making p-adic fields
# part of this category which has a lot of side
# effects (adding methods which will show up
# in tab completion for example).  For now we
# just stick with Map.
```
having extra methods via tab completion is a good thing, especially as they are all still applicable to the objects. That specific reason really is not a good argument for not doing that, but are there other side effects that cause problems?

Yep.

No problem. It is something beyond the current ticket and not important for your applications. It is something I could look into too when I have more time as well.

In the mathematical sense, the category stores this information (i.e., it is an R-module, so it returns the dimension as an R-module), although we have partially removed this information.
