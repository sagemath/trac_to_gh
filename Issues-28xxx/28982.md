We use `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to compute the face lattice of a polyhedron.

Along the way we implement `hasse_diagram` for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and `Polyhedron_base`.

Instead of caching `face_lattice`, we cache `hasse_diagram` now.

This is much slower, but removes a memory leak. As `hasse_diagram` is hardly used with #28646, this seems to be reasonable.

Caching the face lattice does create a memory leak:

```
sage: import gc
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.my_face_lattice = P.face_lattice()
sage: n = get_memory_usage()
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.my_face_lattice = P.face_lattice()
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: n == get_memory_usage()
False
```

Hasse is a lastname, so you can capitalize it within the documentation.

Could the function below have more information? Like which order is meant to be simulated here? Inclusion or lex on indices of vertices, etc? Just one more sentence to specify might be nice?

```diff

Is there a reason why the hasse diagram of the combinatorial polyhedron is not cached?

You are right.
I'm surprised it worked that way.
The hash function should be consistent now. And `__lt__` returns `None` if the faces are clearly incompatible.
What's nice about this hash function, if I understand it correctly, is that it allows to store faces in sets etc.
