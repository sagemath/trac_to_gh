I am the owner of the files in `~/.polymake/`. I did not add manually anything special. And polymake from the system is working fine.

The only reason I can imagine is that polymake 3.5 (from the system) did install some stuff in `~/.polymake/` that perturbed the build of polymake 3.4.
- Is it worth a report to polymake dev?
- Should we have a `spkg-configure.m4` to avoid building polymake if already present on the system?
- Should we have some kind of warning when `./polymake` is already populated?

Yes, after we upgrade to 3.5. The interface using jupymake requires a threadsafety patch to polymake 3.4; 3.5 has a solution

No, I don't think so, let's just switch to 3.5 soon.
