As of sage-9.0.beta6, applying multiple contractions or multiple symmetries to tensors in indices notation raises a NotImplementedError. 

This tickets aims at removing this error by implementing the adequate behavior as well as adding a convention check on the index notation.

The index notation should allow : 
\\*  Multiple contraction 
\\*  Multiple symmetries
\\*  indices denoted by a non-accentuated latin caracter  {a,...,z,A,...,Z} and wild card "."
\\*  covariant indices first notation as well as contravariant indices first
\\*  Latex notations '{' and '}'
\\*  if indices do not begin by `^` nor `_` then contravariant indices first is assumed 
\\The index notation should not allow :
\\*  Repeated indices of the same type
\\*  indices denoted by any other caracter
\\*  nested symmetries
\\*  unbalanced parentheses/brackets


NB : Usual index notations allows greek indices but their implementation seems more difficult and is not the goal of the ticket.

Thanks for making all doctest passed.
I gave a more in-depth look at the code and it looks very good.
I've just performed some reviewer tweaks, which I pushed in the new branch. You can see the (minor) changes [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/0823e29c5fa02815c71a23f770f8ee226eec7c76).
In particular
- a doctest block has been corrected by adding a missing `::`
- some PEP 8 enforcement has been performed
- doctests raising an exception have been rewritten via `Traceback...` instead of a `try` block
- the header  `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` has been added to the file `tensor_with_indices.py`, in order to get rid of the non-ascii error revealed by the patchbot.

Do you agree with the above changes?

Hi! 

 I completely agree! We should open another ticket or a discussion of devel to discuss this (I would at the very least ask Eric Gourgoulhon for validation). 

 To begin the discussion, I see other issues with the current implementation and methods.
For instance, it's not possible to define the symmetries of the riemann tensor. This is related to the fact that (anti)symmetrize ony takes a set of indices as argument and then consider the action of the natural action of the symmetric group this set.
It would be appreciable to define the symmetrization via an action of some group on the set indices. Antisymmetrization would need also a 'signature' morphism G-->{1,-1}. More generally, one could consider linear group action symmetries.

Indeed, this would be nice.
