```
Keywords: Elliptic Curves, period lattice, generators, basis

For example

```
EllipticCurve('11a').period_lattice().gens()
```
returns the generators but does not allow the parameter "precision." The command `gens()` calls the command `basis()` that allows the user to compute with arbitrary precision. I want to add this parameter to `gens()`.
