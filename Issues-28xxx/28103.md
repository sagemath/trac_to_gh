in python3 only

I get (with python3) this new failure in 8.9.b0:

```
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx", line 2055, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint.galois_group
Failed example:
    G = f.galois_group(); G
Expected:
    Transitive group number 5 of degree 4
Got:
    Exception (FLINT memory_manager). Unable to allocate memory.
    Transitive group number 5 of degree 4
```
Could that be caused by ticket #27721 ?
