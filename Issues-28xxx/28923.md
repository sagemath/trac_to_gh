This metaticket lists proposed (or completed) changes to the `julia_plot` function.

* **Generalize to all polynomials** (done). #23740 generalizes `julia_plot` to all polynomials, instead of only the usual quadratic polynomial `z^2 + c`.

* **Deprecation notice** (won't fix). In order to make the generalization, #23740 changes the interface of `julia_plot` to be keyword based. Shouldn't this backwards-incompatible change have a deprecation notice? (If so, it would be good to get this deprecation into the 9.0 release.) I have opened ticket #28924 for this.

* **Bug fix: correct escape radius**. As explained in #28557, the algorithm in `julia_plot` uses a faulty calculation of the escape radius, so many plots do not show the entire Julia set. The patch in #28557 fixes this mistake for the special case of quadratic polynomials, but the correction needs to be extended to other polynomials.

* **Documentation correction**. The documentation says that `julia_plot` plots a Julia set, but it actually plots the *filled* Julia set. The docstrings should be fixed.

* **Restore simple interface for quadratic polynomials**. The new interface (created by gh-aodesky) in #23740 is generally an improvement, but I think we should retain a very simple interface for plotting the filled Julia set of `z^2 + c`, which is all that most users will want. I propose to replace `julia_plot` with a function `julia_set_plot(c)` to plot the filled Julia set of `z^2 + c` (using an optimized algorithm), and a separate function `julia_set_of_polynomial_plot` for the general polynomials covered by #23740. The new functions will be experimental, in order to allow for continuing development in the next few weeks.

* **Allow matplotlib colormaps**. The plot routines should be enhanced to utilize matplotlib colormaps, instead of only interpolating a color gradient between `base_color` and white. (In addition, the user should be able to choose the color of the filled Julia set, instead of being required to use black.) These options should also be provided for plots of the Mandelbrot set.

* **Allow close-ups of Mandelbrot set**. Instead of always plotting the entire Mandelbrot set, the user should be allowed to choose a plot window that shows a small region near the selected value of `c`.

* **Utilize matplotlib**. In order to make axes and other options available to the user, perhaps the plot routines should be modified to use matplotlib (instead of directly creating a png file).

* **Click to choose Julia set**. In a notebook interface, it would be great to be able to click on a point in the picture of the Mandelbrot set, to get a plot of the corresponding filled Julia set.
