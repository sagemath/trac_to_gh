* https://pypi.org/project/prompt-toolkit/ 3.0.5 (current as of 2020-06-05)

All of these package versions support python >= 3.6 (note #29033).

Tarballs: see `checksums.ini` [`upstream_url`]. (To configure Sage to download from the upstream URLs, use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`)

The new jedi completion engine seems to have some problems. For example with IPython 7.6.1, invoking tab completion like

```
sage: 1 + <TAB>
```
causes the interpreter to freeze for about 1.5 minutes (apparently, a largish cache is created at `~/.cache/jedi/`). After that, several deprecated functions are imported into global scope causing deprecation warnings to be printed, such as:

```
Importing absolute_igusa_invariants_kohel from here is deprecated. If you need to use it, please import it directly from sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.invariants
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28064 for details.
  return getattr(handle.access, attribute)(*args, **kwargs)
```
This also seems to slow down exiting Sage.

As for the display of dictionaries during doctests, I suggest to open a separate ticket to remove the sorting. This can be done independently from the IPython upgrade, once Python 2 support is dropped by Sage (in 9.1 I assume).

Here is a branch for IPython 7.13, which requires new packages jedi and backcall, to give people something new to play with, especially since we're getting close to starting the 9.2 release cycle.

I don't see the problem reported at #29428, or at least the small example there doesn't cause problems for me. The preparser doesn't work, though. I'm about to try the patch in [comment:16](#comment:16), after which I'll add it to the branch. (Is there a missing or an extra single quote on line 47 of that patch?)

Here is the preparser patch from [comment:16](#comment:16) (although without the lines changing `sys.getrecursionlimit()`). When merged with #29042, I see these doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/misc/package.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/sat/solvers/dimacs.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/doc/en/reference/sat/index.rst  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
- Almost all of these come from brial:

```
      File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/IPYTHON/sage-9.1.rc1/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/brial/gbrefs.py", line 9, in <module>
        import imp
    ...
    DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
```
- It seems that `jedi` needs `parso` as a prerequisite, and that causes the failure in `cmdline.py`.
- The error in `misc/package.py` looks like another one from sorting dictionaries, and so it should be dealt with at #29042:

```
Failed example:
    installed_packages()  # optional - build
Expected:
    {...'alabaster': ...'pynac': ...}
```
pynac appeared before alabaster in the actual output, unfortunately.

The test tests two things, if I see this correctly:
- Changing the recursion limit in the method allows for

```
a=s([3,2]).expand(8)(flatten([[QQbar.zeta(3)^d for d in range(3)], [QQbar.zeta(5)^d for d in range(5)]]))
```
  to be exactified.
- Also the recursion limit should be the same after the method was called.

If the initial recursion limit is already 3000, the test doesn't work anymore. As `a` can be exactified without modifying the recursion limit in the method `exactify` (I checked). So the test passes with the solution in [comment:43](#comment:43), but it is almost meaningless.

I see two solutions for this:

- Replace `a` by

```
a=s([3,2]).expand(10)(flatten([[QQbar.zeta(3)^d for d in range(3)], [QQbar.zeta(7)^d for d in range(7)]]))
```
  This value cannot be exactified with recursion limit 3000, but it works fine once the method increases the recursion limit.
  However the doctest takes a bit longer.
- We could modify the recursion limit before and after the doctest. This is faster. However, we rely on the same machinery as the method.

  The advantage is that this really is a long time solution. If with some new update the default recursion limit is increased again, we can still see that the method works correctly.
