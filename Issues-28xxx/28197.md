<a id='comment:18'></a>The new jedi completion engine seems to have some problems. For example with IPython 7.6.1, invoking tab completion like

```
sage: 1 + <TAB>

causes the interpreter to freeze for about 1.5 minutes (apparently, a largish cache is created at `~/.cache/jedi/`). After that, several deprecated functions are imported into global scope causing deprecation warnings to be printed, such as:

```

  return getattr(handle.access, attribute)(*args, **kwargs)
```
This also seems to slow down exiting Sage.

As for the display of dictionaries during doctests, I suggest to open a separate ticket to remove the sorting. This can be done independently from the IPython upgrade, once Python 2 support is dropped by Sage (in 9.1 I assume).

It all comes down from the first test failing because of the `%%cython` magic function not being found. Any clue as to what to do to fix that?

<a id='comment:33'></a>Here is the preparser patch from comment:16 (although without the lines changing `sys.getrecursionlimit()`). When merged with #29042, I see these doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # 1 doctest failed

sage -t --long src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
- Almost all of these come from brial:

```
      File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/IPYTHON/sage-9.1.rc1/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/brial/gbrefs.py", line 9, in <module>
        import imp
    ...
    DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
```
- It seems that `jedi` needs `parso` as a prerequisite, and that causes the failure in `cmdline.py`.
- The error in `misc/package.py` looks like another one from sorting dictionaries, and so it should be dealt with at #29042:

```
Failed example:
    installed_packages()  # optional - build
Expected:
    {...'alabaster': ...'pynac': ...}
```
pynac appeared before alabaster in the actual output, unfortunately.

Uhm, for some reason I haven't been getting emails from this ticket (and many others). The brial issues are fixed in 1.2.6, sage's package seems to be quite outdated (latest version is 1.2.8)

When I ported the preparser, I removed quite a few tests from `SagePromptTransformer()`, those should probably be brought back somewhere.

<a id='comment:54'></a>The test tests two things, if I see this correctly:
- Changing the recursion limit in the method allows for

```
a=s([3,2]).expand(8)(flatten([[QQbar.zeta(3)^d for d in range(3)], [QQbar.zeta(5)^d for d in range(5)]]))
```
  to be exactified.
- Also the recursion limit should be the same after the method was called.

If the initial recursion limit is already 3000, the test doesn't work anymore. As `a` can be exactified without modifying the recursion limit in the method `exactify` (I checked). So the test passes with the solution in comment:43, but it is almost meaningless.

I see two solutions for this:

- Replace `a` by

```
a=s([3,2]).expand(10)(flatten([[QQbar.zeta(3)^d for d in range(3)], [QQbar.zeta(7)^d for d in range(7)]]))
```
  This value cannot be exactified with recursion limit 3000, but it works fine once the method increases the recursion limit.
  However the doctest takes a bit longer.
- We could modify the recursion limit before and after the doctest. This is faster. However, we rely on the same machinery as the method.

  The advantage is that this really is a long time solution. If with some new update the default recursion limit is increased again, we can still see that the method works correctly.
