This is a follow-up from #28175 (Move optional sage optimization backends (COIN, CPLEX, Gurobi) to separate Cython packages to remove `OptionalExtension` problems).

In fact, `sage.numerical.backends` depends on very little from Sage.  We could move the entire backend machinery to a separate packages - for broadening the developer base and/or within the context of #26511.

Some notes regarding this:
- `get_solver` uses `base_ring` - needs some mild refactoring to avoid dependency on the `sagelib` parent/element framework
- `GLPKBackend` depends on `sage.libs.glpk`, which should also become a separate Cython package. See also #26511 for alternatives.
