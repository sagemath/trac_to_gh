There are 7 failing doctests in base.py using optional packages (`latte_int` and `lrslib`):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py  # 7 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_ZZ.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This tickets fixes them. The remaining packages are 'polymake' and 'polytopes_db_4d', which are experimental or not yet known status (see #26029).
