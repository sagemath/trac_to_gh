We speed up the calculation of the incidence matrix by avoiding recomputation.

The obvious way to implement it, is by doing a nested loop (one loop for `Vrepresentation`, one for `Hrepresentation`).
We do not change this.
However, the inner loop should not recompute things, e.g.
- the vector of a representation element,
- the index of a representation element,
- how to compute the product of two representation element (this consists of nested methods again),
  instead call the product of two vectors directly.

Before:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time _ = P.incidence_matrix()
CPU times: user 2.21 s, sys: 52.4 ms, total: 2.26 s
Wall time: 2.21 s
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A',10],backend='normaliz')
sage: %time _ = P.incidence_matrix()
CPU times: user 21.7 s, sys: 129 ms, total: 21.9 s
Wall time: 21.7 s
```

After:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time _ = P.incidence_matrix()
CPU times: user 682 ms, sys: 81.4 ms, total: 764 ms
Wall time: 606 ms
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A',10],backend='normaliz')
sage: %time _ = P.incidence_matrix()
CPU times: user 6.16 s, sys: 67.5 ms, total: 6.23 s
Wall time: 6.16 s
```

It is faster and still correct.
One suggestion: I think it would be a good idea to add more examples in the docstring.
For instance, you can add an example for unbounded polyhedron:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0,0), (1,1,0)], rays=[(1,0,0)], lines=[(0,0,1)])
sage: P.incidence_matrix()
[1 1 1]
[1 1 0]
[1 0 1]
[0 1 1]
```

You wrote that "The incidence matrix is not unique up to permutation for unbounded polyhedra", I believe you meant something else.

Plus, it would be nice to include the following example (which you suggested before). This is an example of two "combinatorially isomorphic" polyhedra with different incidence matrices.

```
sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0],[-1,0]],rays=[[0,1]])
sage: P1.incidence_matrix()
[1 1 0]
[1 0 1]
[0 1 1]
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0],[-1,0]],rays=[[0,1], [1,1]])
sage: P2.incidence_matrix()
[1 1 0]
[1 0 0]
[0 1 1]
[0 0 1]
```
