This is an addition to the PlumbingGraph() class which calculates the zeta function introduced by Campillo, Delgado and Gusein-Zade, and by Némethi. It assumes that the plumbing graph is the link of a singularity (i.e. edges are positive, genera are positive, the intersection matrix is negative definite) and that the link is a rational homology sphere (i.e. genera are zero and the graph is a tree). In this case, the CDGN zeta function, a topological invariant, coincides with a Poincaré series in certain cases, although this does not hold in general.

Keywords: plumbing graph, zeta function, rational homology three sphere

I pushed some code here, only so anyone can look at it if they want to. There still seem to be some small issues, so it's not ready yet. But it can still compute some stuff.
