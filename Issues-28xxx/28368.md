This is an addition to the PlumbingGraph() class which calculates the zeta function introduced by Campillo, Delgado and Gusein-Zade, and by Némethi. It assumes that the plumbing graph is the link of a singularity (i.e. edges are positive, genera are positive, the intersection matrix is negative definite) and that the link is a rational homology sphere (i.e. genera are zero and the graph is a tree). In this case, the CDGN zeta function, a topological invariant, coincides with a Poincaré series in certain cases, although this does not hold in general.

Depends on #26945

Keywords: **plumbing graph, zeta function, rational homology three sphere**
