This ticket will allow the following code to work:

```
sage: P.<a, b, c, d> = ProductProjectiveSpaces(GF(5), [1, 1])
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2], domain=P)
sage: f.cyclegraph().plot()
```
This is done by adding field and finite_field subclasses to dynamical_systems in product_projective_ds.
The field subclass will be empty and the finite_field subclass will contain the cyclegraph function.

Dynamical systems for subschemes of product projective spaces needs work. Until then, this function will not be implemented for subschemes. Updated documentation to reflect this.
