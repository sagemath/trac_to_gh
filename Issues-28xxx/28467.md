with Sage 8.8:

```
sage: sum(1./p for p in prime_range(436272668))
...
ValueError: Cannot compute primes beyond 436273290
```
Clearly the value 436272668 is below the given bound, thus the error message is misleading.

What is the purpose?\n\nThanks for your helpful comments. I'm sorry for taking so long to respond.\n\nIt's a surprise to me that this syntax was not allowed -- I assumed that it would be ok (but my cython knowledge is rudimentary and I never tested it).  It was accepted for the \"pari_isprime\" algorithm: \n\n```\nsage: prime_range(\"90\",\"100\", \"pari_isprime\")\n[97]\n```\nI would consider the incompatible behaviors of the two algorithms to be a (minor) bug.\n\nActually, though, my motivation for the doctest was not really about that particular syntax. The original code assumes that start and stop are integers (or None), and it's hard to predict how it will react if the user passes in some other type of object that is not exactly an integer. So I added `start = Integer(start)` (and similarly for stop), in order to make sure that each input will act exactly like an integer, and also to produce an understandable error message if the function is called on an unacceptable type. (My original code gave a misleading error message when the strings \"90\" and \"100\" were passed for start and stop. I think that message would give the clear impression that there was a bug, rather than user error.)

Thanks for your helpful comments. I'm sorry for taking so long to respond.

It's a surprise to me that this syntax was not allowed -- I assumed that it would be ok (but my cython knowledge is rudimentary and I never tested it).  It was accepted for the "pari_isprime" algorithm: 

```
sage: prime_range("90","100", "pari_isprime")
[97]
```
I would consider the incompatible behaviors of the two algorithms to be a (minor) bug.

Actually, though, my motivation for the doctest was not really about that particular syntax. The original code assumes that start and stop are integers (or None), and it's hard to predict how it will react if the user passes in some other type of object that is not exactly an integer. So I added `start = Integer(start)` (and similarly for stop), in order to make sure that each input will act exactly like an integer, and also to produce an understandable error message if the function is called on an unacceptable type. (My original code gave a misleading error message when the strings "90" and "100" were passed for start and stop. I think that message would give the clear impression that there was a bug, rather than user error.) It seems to me that type-checking or coercion should be in the code, but I don't know whether sage developers have some other standard convention for this.

I added the doctest to verify that the `start = Integer(start)` patch is still there (but perhaps it would be better to have a doctest to confirm that non-Integer input produces a reasonable error message).

I will need to think about this. 

The failed example calls `prime_range` with an argument that is a non-integer real number, which I did not think was allowed. It seems that, for backward compatibility, such an argument needs to be allowed at least when `algorithm="pari_primes"`, even though the original function gives a `TypeError` when `algorithm="is_prime"`.

You are right. I was confused. Before I started work on this, the algorithm "pari_primes" allowed real numbers, and the algorithm "pari_isprime" allowed strings, but neither allowed both. I will upload a PR to restore this behavior (i.e., the patch removes the code that tests and coerces the input). The patch also mentions this behavior in a note in the docstring.

I opened ticket:28712 to discuss the allowable input.

The change in behavior you proposed is bad. If a user provides `algorithm="pari_primes"` the function should not silently switch to the `"pari_isprime"` version. The adaptation should only applies when the algorithm is not explicitly specified.

Also, the NOTE is more confusing than anything else. You don't want to document that kind of behavior that forces you to stick to it in the future. If you feel it needs something, simply write: `if the input is not numerical then the behavior is not specified.`

Minor comments
- Instead of writing <code>The sage command \`\`primes\`\`</code> you would better use references <code>The sage command :func:\`~sage.arith.misc.primes\`</code>. That produces a link in the compiled documentation.
- To describe strings as argument I think Sage preferrs <code>\`\`"pari_primes"\`\`</code> rather than `"pari_primes"`.
- Don't write `trac ticket 28467` but <code>:trac:\`28467\`</code> (which produces a link in the compiled documentation).
- Please test `prime_range(9.5, 14.3)` with both `"pari_primes"` and `"pari_isprime"`.

Why is that? If one can not do beyond `436273290` and the other can, we should restrict the latter to not do it so that they behave the same?

> so the followup ticket #28712 addresses the fact that `prime_range(9.5, 14.3)` raises an error for one algorithm, but not the other.

This is about the interface, and I agree that it should be consistent.

Minor style comments.

Compare to `None` with `is`, not `==`:

```diff
-    if algorithm == None:
+    if algorithm is None:
```

Two spaces before `#` for inline comments:

```diff
-    DEF small_prime_max = 436273009 # a prime < init_primes_max (preferably the largest)
-    DEF prime_gap_bound = 250 # upper bound for gap between primes <= small_prime_max
+    DEF small_prime_max = 436273009  # a prime < init_primes_max (preferably the largest)
+    DEF prime_gap_bound = 250  # upper bound for gap between primes <= small_prime_max
```

Proposed rephrasing and reformatting for the `ValueError` message:

```diff
         if max(start, stop or 0) > small_prime_max:
-            raise ValueError('algorithm "pari_primes" cannot compute primes larger than'
-                + ' {}'.format(small_prime_max - 1))
+            s = 'algorithm "pari_primes" is limited to primes less than {}'
+            raise ValueError(s.format(small_prime_max - 1))
```

Patchbots are happy. What do other reviewers think?
