Currently coercion of polyhedra with number fields does not work. The following results in a type error:

```
sage: z = QQ['z'].0                                          
sage: K = NumberField(z^2 - 2,'s')
sage: K.gen()*polytopes.simplex(backend='field')
```

But the backend can surely handle it, as the following does work:

```
sage: z = QQ['z'].0                                          
sage: K = NumberField(z^2 - 2,'s')
sage: K.gen()*polytopes.simplex(backend='field', base_ring=K)
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in s with defining polynomial z^2 - 2)^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
```

The underlying error:

```
sage: z = QQ['z'].0                                          
sage: K = NumberField(z^2 - 2,'s')
sage: parent = polytopes.simplex().parent()
sage: parent._coerce_base_ring(K)
Rational Field
```

But it should be `K`.

The problem is that `_coerce_base_ring` of `Polyhedra_base` just takes the base ring of `K`, which are the rationals.

We fix this, by not taking the base ring, if the object is already a ring.
