This ticket adds the binomial transform and inverse binomial transform functions for sequences. For example, this enables:

```
sage: binom_trans([fibonacci(n) for n in [0..9]])
[0, 1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, 377, 987, 2584]
```

```
sage: binom_trans_inv([4^n for n in [0..9]])
[1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683]
```

* I don't see any particular reason to use abbreviations in the method names, they can just be spelled out as `binomial_transform()` and `binomial_transform_inverse()`.

* The `SEEALSO:` blocks need to be `.. SEEALSO:`.

* I don't like the choice of `a` as the input, it doesn't stick out as being the name of a variable when you don't have additional formatting available (like reading doc in the terminal).

* I would manually program in a hack that would allow 'n' to be a negative integer, and when is 'n' is negative, it gives you the `len(a)-n+1`st element of the transform (so it matches Python convention of the -1 giving you the last entry of a list.

* I don't think the OUTPUT strings should have capitalized "OR", I think a comma and lowercase would suffice.

I will hopefully be able to make these changes this week during Sage Days, but typing them out so I don't forget.
