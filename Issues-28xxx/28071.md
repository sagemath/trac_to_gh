Currently we cannot calculate the global height of an element that is not already an explicit element of `QQ`, `QQbar`, or `NumberField`. For example,

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(AlgebraicRealField(), 1)
sage: Q = P(10)
sage: Q.global_height()
```

currently fails, when we should be able to calculate the global heights for a point in any field that can be embedded into `QQbar`. We use coercion to `QQbar` in the `global_height()` function to solve this problem. There are also numerous instances in the `projective_ds` file where a check is made on the base field for the sole purpose of safely calling the `global_height()` function. We have removed these checks in favor of a single check in the `global_height()` function.

Two questions here:

1) Can the new ``except'' trap a specific error?

2) It would be better if the example had elements actually in the field you are defining instead of just over QQ.
