Currently, we have a keyword `prec` for power series, but not for Laurent series. A consequence of this is that the function `qexp_eta` cannot be applied to Laurent series, as observed in this [blog post](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/blogs/2018/08/03/PuiseuxSeries/), for example.

```
sage: L.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: qexp_eta(L, prec=30)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: _element_constructor_() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prec'
```

This ticket adds the keyword to Laurent series, as well.

I realize the application of that keyword appending a call of the `add_bigoh` method in order to share the same code for the same functionality.
