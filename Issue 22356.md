For some reason, `setuptools` stopped working for me in 7.6.rc0:

```
Processing /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pip-8.1.2.p1/src
  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip-c8S0GC-build/setup.py) egg_info for package from file:///usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pip-8.1.2.p1/src

    Traceback (most recent call last):

```


Looking at the sources, it is obvious why: `packaging.version` is not automatically imported. So it only works if `packaging.version` was accidentally imported somewhere else. This seems to be fixed in a newer version of `setuptools`.
