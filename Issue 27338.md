A regular string in JS needs line continuation markers. The back ticks turn the string into a template literal, which is allowed to include new lines.

After reviewing the code in #22670 that added this fallback, I reverted to a normal JS string. That way older browsers and other environments should be supported.

As a JS person, I would never think of copying an entire library into every file I create. While it is a possible solution, it just doesn't seem elegant. This fallback is intended for files shared on the web, which implies internet access to a CDN.

Please describe what problems you encountered at Luminy. Was there any lack of internet access? If this fallback had been working properly, then perhaps there would have been no issues.

I agree that it's not elegant. But you probably wouldn't dynamically emit script tags, would you?

Personally, I really don't mind if this code contacts a CDN but one could argue that this could also run in a local webserver that is not meant to access the internet.

There was no lack of internet access. I forget what the setup was unfortunately. Somehow this was served through an interface/web server that could not resolve the path to the local three.js assets. I assume that this fallback would have fixed the problem.

So, I'll set this to positive review as this definitely fixes an existing bug (currently, we are emitting JavaScript code with a Syntax Error.) Whether this is a privacy issue in the first place can be discussed in a new issue imho. Feel free to set that one to critical if you have strong feelings about it.
