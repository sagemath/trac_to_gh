Nice catch. If you want to edit `hasse_diagram.py`, you might also want to correct the docstring of `closed_interval` (though now that I'm thinking about it, why not make it an alias of `interval`? is the `interval` method supposed to take some keyword parameters determining if it's closed or open one day?) and the missing backquotes in the `_rank_dict` docstring (on its second line).
