I will say nothing.
Nothing.
It may get messy otherwise.

Nice catch. If you want to edit `hasse_diagram.py`, you might also want to correct the docstring of `closed_interval` (though now that I'm thinking about it, why not make it an alias of `interval`? is the `interval` method supposed to take some keyword parameters determining if it's closed or open one day?) and the missing backquotes in the `_rank_dict` docstring (on its second line).

Honestly this code makes me sick .... Interval is so not optimized... `O_O`

If you're fine with my trivial edits (yeah, first successful git commit and whatever), it's positive review. Thanks for catching this very interesting reinterpretation of the word "chain"!
