sage: var("a,b,c,k,r,q,i,j,m,n,p,s,t,x,y,z")
(a, b, c, k, r, q, i, j, m, n, p, s, t, x, y, z)
sage: assume(x^2+(-4*n-2)*x+1>0)
sage: f=function('f',x)
sage: desolve(x*diff(f(x),x,2)+(1-x)*diff(f(x),x)+n*f,f,ivar=x)
...
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(x^2+(-4*n-2)*x+1>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is x^2+(-4*n-2)*x+1 positive or negative?
```

(the ODE of the Laguerre polynomials)
