CC:  jpflori nthiery

Keywords: scheme homset

Hom sets in the category of schemes are constructed in a category that is not specific enough:

```
sage: Schemes().Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of schemes, Category of objects]
```

Compare

```
sage: Sets().Homsets().all_super_categories()
[Category of homsets of sets,
 Category of homsets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```

By definition of categories C, for each pair of objects A,B of C, the morphisms in C from A to B form a set. So, it seems very odd to me that homsets of schemes currently aren't sets.

Yes, something in the category framework is preventing `Schemes().Homsets()` from being in `Sets()`.  It seems possible to fix this by just deleting some code (see the branch and :comment:26:ticket:15618).

Indeed a bug, as we make in sage.categories.homsets.Homsets.super_categories the assumption that Sage manipulates only "small categories" whose homsets are therefore sets.

I have tracked down the issue, and am now creating a ticket.

Now I am puzzled. In EACH category, the morphisms between two fixed objects forms a set. "Small" category means that the class of objects of the category is a set.

Is it not what this ticket is about?

Sorry, I meant «locally small»

> Is it not what this ticket is about?

Yeah, maybe: The description seemed too narrow to me, kind of the
symptom rather than the cause. But probably this ticket can be closed
once #17364 is done.
