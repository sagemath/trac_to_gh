A few near trivial comments:

IIRC, it is considered better practice to do this:

```diff
-        return self._f.valuation(place) + 2*min(F(x).valuation(place), 0) \
-                + F.different().valuation(place)
+        return (self._f.valuation(place) + 2*min(F(x).valuation(place), 0)
+                + F.different().valuation(place))
```

so if something is unmatched, it is guaranteed to yield an error.

The `list` is unnecessary in here: `return hash(tuple(sorted(list(self._data))))`.

``ValueError`` -> ```ValueError```

Instead of importing `IntegerRing` and asking for an instance, I would just import `ZZ` and use that (IMO, it also makes the code easier to read).

`e = f * sep **(-val)` -> `e = f * sep**(-val)` (PEP8 allows higher priority operators to not have a space around them; otherwise you need the space on the other side `;)`)

I agree. Fixed.

> The `list` is unnecessary in here: `return hash(tuple(sorted(list(self._data))))`.

Actually there was a bug here. It is now ` hash(tuple(sorted(self._data.items()))) `

> ``ValueError`` -> ```ValueError```

Done.

> Instead of importing `IntegerRing` and asking for an instance, I would just import `ZZ` and use that (IMO, it also makes the code easier to read).

Right. Done.

> `e = f * sep **(-val)` -> `e = f * sep**(-val)` (PEP8 allows higher priority operators to not have a space around them; otherwise you need the space on the other side `;)`)

Right. It is a typo. Fixed.

Travis, I put in a very small fix into the already positively-reviewed patches. This fixes a bug I found only lately. With the fix, this works:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(5)); _.<Y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(Y-1)
sage: L.genus()
0
```


Previously, this failed basically because `L` is a trivial extension of `K`.

I am sorry to add this in the last minute. If you are ok, I would set it positive review again.

Once you add a doctest showing this, you can set it back to a positive review.
