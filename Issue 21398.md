This patch will add a function to iterate over isomorphic sublattices; compare to `isomoprhic_subposets_iterator()`.

Implementation is trivial. Better ideas are welcome.

What happens when this is given a poset which is not a lattice? Should it fail? From looking at the code, it seems like it would start going through and then `sublattice` would be the point of failure. Also, this makes sense for a general poset, so could we move it up to there?

This (indirectly) calls `self.meet()` and `self.join()`, hence does not make sense to move function to posets.

In this implementation `other` can really be any poset, but if it is not a lattice by structure, the function will return empty list (i.e. instantly raise `StopIteration`). How should this behave?

Ah, yes. I agree.

You should add an example showing this happens and perhaps change the input to say `- ``other`` --  finite poset`.

One other little detail, remove the period in the `.. SEEALSO::` blocks.

I thinked slightly more about this. We can always loose restrictions from a lattice to a poset, and so this code wants exactly lattices. It may also help if I try to invent some better way to list isomorphic sublattices.
