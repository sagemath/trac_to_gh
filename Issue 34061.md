# Issue 34061: 3d graphics do not show

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34298

Original creator: yzh

Using Conda and Chrome, the following gives an empty page. The same happens with the options `viewer='threejs'` or `viewer='jsmol'`. See attached file graphic.html.

```
sage: plot3d(lambda u,v:(u^2+v^2)/4-2,(-2,2),(-2,2)).show()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```


The problem does not appear in Jupyter Notebook.
The problem does not appear either if the option `online=True` is provided. See attached file graphic_online_true.html.

`@`yzh: To test this, merge this ticket and repeat the lines with `bootstrap` and `mamba env update` in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#using-conda-to-provide-all-dependencies-for-the-sage-library-experimental
