This ticket is not merged, tarball are not usually mirrored before Volker attempt to merge the tickets. You'll have to fetch the source a different way. Matthias created a handy way of using a string called `upstream_url` in the file checksum.ini to do the fetching from upstream but I cannot remember how it works.
