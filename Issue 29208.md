There are several failing doctests depending on the PARI version of the system, see e.g.


```
File "src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py", line 1829, in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_ideal.NumberFieldFractionalIdeal.factor
Failed example:
    fact = F.factor(2); fact
Expected:
    (Fractional ideal (2*a^2 + 1))^2 * (Fractional ideal (-2*a^2))
Got:
    (Fractional ideal (-2*a^2 - 1))^2 * (Fractional ideal (2*a^2))
```


see e.g.

We fix those tests.

Those tests could be repaired by just checking that the numerical noise is reasonable.

spkg-configure is exactly this business, by definition

But it shouldn't detect versions. It should detect absence of known bugs.

As far as I understand, the patch in the branch #29313 also includes a small doctest.

Can we include this in spkg-configure?

This is probably wrong syntax, but something like this might work:


```
    AC_MSG_CHECKING([does pari have known bug? ])
    bug_check=`echo "bnf = bnfinit(y^4-y-1); bnfisunit(bnf,-y^3+2*y^2-1)" | $GP -qf 2>> config.log`
    expected="[0, 2, Mod(0, 2)]~"
    if test x$bug_check=x$expected; then
        AC_MSG_RESULT([no])
    else
        AC_MSG_RESULT([yes; cannot use system pari/GP with known bug])
        AC_MSG_NOTICE([Patch/upgrade yoour package and reconfigure.])
        AC_MSG_NOTICE([Otherwise Sage will build its own pari/GP.])
        sage_spkg_install_pari=yes
    fi
```

I would wait and see.

For debian buster it checks for the bug and detects that the system pari is fine to use.
