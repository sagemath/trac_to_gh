In the html tutorial, section 3.10, a couple of times "sage_notebook"
is typset in "math mode", so that "n" appearars as a subscript to "e".

I can't find this problem anywhere in that section either in the html version or the pdf.  I have no idea why Nikos saw that.  Those sage_notebook's are typset in a code environment so the
