# Issue 27149: Another micro-optimization to libsingular polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27386

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Before:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x.subs(x=a)
The slowest run took 10.21 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 74.1 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x.subs(x=a)
The slowest run took 58.26 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.4 µs per loop
```

I have a couple of issues with this patch. I am very worried about an infinite loop for this method if you do a subclass of `MPolynomial_libsingular`, so the `super` call should be explicit about the class. It is also missing a doctest. However, I don't see the point of only caching this output. Why not cache the function higher up the class chains? We cache `gens` for all polynomial rings (AFAIK), so it makes sense to do the same for `gens_dict` (in general).

Indeed, thanks!

Actually, `_defining_names()` (the wrapper around `gens()` used by `gens_dict()`) is cached by `CategoryObject`. For most parents, I think `gens_dict()` isn't too expensive to compute once you have `gens()`, and isn't that much used anyway. So I thought it would be wasteful to cache it in all cases (but I have no strong objection either).

Okay, let's try caching it at the level of `CategoryObject`.

I think it does make sense to cache it at the highest level. It should be small in memory (at least, I would be shocked if anyone created something with 10000 generators and not expecting to need a lot of memory), and this way all things that use it can benefit.

There is one problem (that I should have noticed earlier and was a problem even with your original proposal): a `dict` is mutable. So you can really destroy things by mutating the output of `gens_dict`. A `Family` is like an immutable `dict`, but its iteration is over values, not keys. So that is not a backwards compatible change (either). It is more invasive, but perhaps the best thing is to have an internal ``@`lazy_attribute` `_gens_dict` that gets copied for the output of `gens_dict`.

Oooops—thank you, and sorry for the stupid mistake! Here's a new attempt. I used ``@`cached_method`, not ``@`lazy_attribute`, because lazy attributes are computed as soon as you try to access them, and there are parents for which `gens()` returns infinitely many generators, so that the default `gens_dict()` loops.

Well, this works well enough. I found I could get another 1% speedup if I did a manual cache and a `cdef` method called directly (instead of via a Python method. I was expecting actually a bit more. Anyways, LGTM. Thanks.
