You don't need to wait until #24639 is closed, just merge it in and have it as a dependency.

True, but it won't be long to have next beta anyways.

And then I must think about subclassing `LinearExtensions`, add crosslinks etc.

Ready now.

Needs crosslinkig, that it is best done after this "serie" of functions is ready.

In Python, you can just do

```diff
-tmp = A; A = B; B = tmp
+A,B = B,A
```

Otherwise LGTM and you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Good point, I forgot that. Thanks, marking as positive review.
