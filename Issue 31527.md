# Issue 31527: ManifoldSubset: union, intersection, declare_{union,intersection} with arbitrary number of arguments

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31764

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-05-02 20:34:43

CC:  egourgoulhon @mjungmath

In this ticket, we extend `union` and `declare_union` as follows:
- support more than two arguments 
- optional argument `disjoint`
- support 0 arguments (`declare_union` is the same as `declare_empty()`)
- support 1 argument (`declare_union` is the same as `declare_equal(other)`)

Likewise, we extend `declare_intersection` and `intersection`.

We also introduce
- `declare_disjoint(other)` - same as `self.intersection(other).declare_empty()`

Doctests are missing for the methods `_reduce_intersection_members`, `_intersection_subset`, `_reduce_union_members` and `_union_subset`.

What about the Pyflakes error? (local variable 'old' is assigned to but never used)

Ready for review. The error indicated by the patchbot is unrelated to this ticket

Well, pyflakes is still not happy, despite comment:9 commit.
