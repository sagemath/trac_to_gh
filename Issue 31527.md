CC:  @egourgoulhon @mjungmath

In this ticket, we extend `union` and `declare_union` as follows:
- support more than two arguments 
- optional argument `disjoint`
- support 0 arguments (`declare_union` is the same as `declare_empty()`)
- support 1 argument (`declare_union` is the same as `declare_equal(other)`)

Likewise, we extend `declare_intersection` and `intersection`.

We also introduce
- `declare_disjoint(other)` - same as `self.intersection(other).declare_empty()`
