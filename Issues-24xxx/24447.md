When building Sage with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`, cvxopt fails as follows:

I guess one either has let the install script create a missing directory, or needs to configure with `--docdir=...`.

From spkg-install:

```
if [ "x$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = xyes ] ; then
   cd doc
# This part would be used to build the documentation with sphinx.
# cvxopt would then have to depend on sphinx.
# in 1.1.5 the documentation is shipped already built and up to date.
#   ${MAKE} -B html
#   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
#      echo "Error building the documentation"
#      exit 1
#   fi
# checking to see if there is previously installed documentation.
   if [ -d $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html ] ; then
      rm -rf $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html
   fi
   mkdir -p $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html
   cp -r html/* $SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/cvxopt/html/
fi
```
The script mentionas 1.1.5. However, we now have 1.1.8.p2. And in the upstream tarball, I find

```
cvxopt24447/cvxopt-1.1.8$ ls doc/
Makefile  source
```
So, the docs are in fact *not* shipped by upstream. And building the documentation still requires Sphinx.

But isn't the Sage documentation built using something related to Sphinx? I guess one should (on a different ticket) enhance Sage's machinery of building its docs, so that it can be used to build documentation of a third-party Python/Cython package. Admittedly I'm being selfish here: My group cohomology spkg would be the same case.

I tried to build the documentation. But alas, it won't work. Apparently there is something missing in Sage's sphinx:

```
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p2] pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'sphinxcontrib-websupport' distribution was not found and is required by Sphinx
```

So, is it acceptable to add 'sphinxcontrib-websupport' into Sage's sphinx package?

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A3):
> So, is it acceptable to add 'sphinxcontrib-websupport' into Sage's sphinx package?


Is `sphinx` used at all in Sage? I just found that Sage's `sphinx` wouldn't even do `sphinx --help` without websupport.

Therefore, I propose that the spkg-install script for sphinx is extended by

```
pip install sphinxcontrib-websupport
```

Then, as I just tested, the documentation for `cvxopt` builds fine.

Why is that? How can one use `pip` in `spkg-install`? Apparently it isn't `sdh_pip_install`, as that is only for installation of a local package.

Although I noticed it and got all the right bits into Gentoo. I should raise the bar of the packaging in sage I guess.

More concretely, I think `sphinxcontrib-websupport` should be a separate standard spkg, that gives interesting dependency problems but it is the right thing to do. And that means inclusion of the tarball for it to become a local install. Stuff in standard package need to be available locally - so even if you put it in cvxopt's spkg-install it should be in `upstream`. Then because it is an extra on top we don't have a checksum for it. Which is why it needs to be a separate spkg - so not only is it in upstream but we checksum it.
