I will not have access to a python3-build of sage until next week-end.

As far as I remember, when typing "exit", it complains that it was expecting bytes or str and not a lazy string.

You can try and see with the experimental branch (see the recent sage-devel thread)

I would much prefer

```python
def __fspath__(self):
    """
    Docstring here
    """
    return str(self)
```

This works better with inheritance and it allows adding a docstring.
