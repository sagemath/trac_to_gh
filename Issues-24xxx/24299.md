```
sage: sinh(CIF(1))
[1.1752011936438013 .. 1.1752011936438017]
sage: asinh(CIF(1))
0.881373587019543
```
The second command should return a (complex) interval.

Also:

```
sage: asin(CIF(0.6))
...
TypeError: unable to convert '0.59999999999999998?' to a real number
```

since we get with CC:

I did a systematic search and found these additional issues:

```
sage: log_gamma(complex(1.7))
-0.09580769740706588
sage: psi(complex(1.7))
0.2085478748734939
```
Also `dickman_rho` can't handle anything other than float.

The code I used will go into `tests/symbolic-functions.py`.
