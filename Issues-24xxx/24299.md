sage: asinh(CIF(1))

The second command should return a (complex) interval.

I'm not sure about this:

```
sage: acoth(CIF(0.6))
0.693147180559945?
```
since we get with CC:

```
sage: acoth(CC(0.6))
0.693147180559945 - 1.57079632679490*I
```

I did a systematic search and found these additional issues:

```
sage: log_gamma(complex(1.7))
-0.09580769740706588
sage: psi(complex(1.7))
0.2085478748734939
```
Also `dickman_rho` can't handle anything other than float.

The code I used will go into `tests/symbolic-functions.py`.
