These are the minimal fixes I needed to get all the tests passing for `sage.libs.gap` (to be clear, this required fixes in other modules as well--these are just the fixes in `sage.libs.gap` itself).

Mostly just minor string conversion fixes, and one or two other little things.

Keywords: **libs gap libgap**

If you're applying this just on top of the develop branch (or even develop + a few other branches) you won't get all tests passing.  

On my Python 3 branch where I have *lots* of other fixes merged in, all the tests pass, but if you just test this ticket on its own it won't fix everything, because there are other errors that come from outside `sage.libs.gap`.  This just applies the fixes specifically in that package needed for that package to pass.
