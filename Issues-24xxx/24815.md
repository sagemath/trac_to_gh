For *most* intents and purposes instances of `FreeModuleElement` can be used equivalently to `list` or `tuple`, in that they all meet the requirements of the [Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) protocol (which on Python 3 also includes `range`).

This simplifies some code that treats `Vector` distinctly from `list` and `tuple`.  To be clear, in this case we are explicitly treating the `FreeModuleElement` type, and not the abstract `Vector` type which does not meet these requirements, but that's okay since `FreeModuleElement` implements any concrete vector space elements.

By convention, this always imports `collections.Sequence` as `SequenceABC` so as to not confuse it with Sage's `Sequence` class.

See also: #26769 Add an `issequence` utility to check for list, tuple, and other compatible objects

I could incorporate #24742 if it even makes sense to, or just drop the changes there since it's not that important.

There are several problems with checking just for iterability.  In most cases (if not all) that I updated here the code also uses indexing, so you really need that aspect of `Sequence` as well.  The other problem is merely checking for iterability is that it can allow through infinite iterables (whereas `Sequence`--and perhaps this a misnomer on its part--must be finite).  I discussed this problem more in #24757.  As I also mentioned there, while on some level it's the user's responsibility not to pass in infinite generators, for example, where they don't belong, it's nice to prevent it where possible.  zip, map, filter, etc. are all problematic here.

The performance issue is a real concern though.  Just note that in addition to `list`, `tuple`, and `Vector` this is also adding support for `range` on Python 3 (and by extension any other custom type that would work just as well here, including possibly some other types in Sage).

I guess it's a question of context and what the relative overhead is.  200 x (eps < 1ns) is nothing if the overall method is on the order of 10ms, say, and what the likelihood is of using that call in a loop (or even its frequency in the test suite).  For the matrix constructor most of all that's certainly worth looking at closely.

But then the case where it's not an instance of the ABC will still be slow.

I have sometimes been thinking about adding a fast Cython function caching calls to `isinstance(..., some_type)`. If implemented well, this could be very fast.

I'm thinking about this again, and wondering what exactly you mean.  I think we really need some convenient `isiterable` and perhaps `issequence` functions, perhaps in `sage.cpython`.  It doesn't necessarily *have* to work with the ABC framework.  Perhaps we can just explicitly enumerate some specific types we care about for these cases (list, tuple, vector, (x)range, ...) which are going to be by far the most common.  On the other hand, this is pretty inflexible, and that's where the ABC system is quite nice as it is very flexible, but that comes at a small cost.

There is also already caching built into ABCs, albeit implemented mostly in pure Python.  Each ABC has a `_abc_cache` attribute, which is a `WeakSet` of all types known to implement that ABC (e.g. `Sequence._abc_cache` on Python 2 contains, by default, `list`, `tuple`, `basestring`, `buffer`, and `xrange`).  There is also a `Sequence._abc_negative_cache` for negative lookups, also  `WeakSet`.  This gets invalidated any time a new ABC is registered.

Some interesting news is that Python 3.7 added a new C implementation of ABCMeta, which makes everything a bit faster.  On Python 2.7:

```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
```

and on 3.7:


```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=[]' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
500000 loops, best of 5: 543 nsec per loop
```

So a little more than twice as fast?

Negative lookups are improved even more:

```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 usec per loop
```

```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, Sequence)'
500000 loops, best of 5: 534 nsec per loop
```

Of course, isinstance on a non-ABC is still much faster:

```
python3.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections.abc import Sequence; l=0' 'isinstance(l, tuple)'
2000000 loops, best of 5: 168 nsec per loop
```

but naturally, it slows down if the argument is a tuple, the more elements you add.  This is probably significantly optimized in Cython too.

Going back to Python 2, I think nearly half the time is just spent in the lookup into the `WeakSet` cache:

```
python2.7 -m timeit -s 'from collections import Sequence; l=[]' 't = getattr(l, "__class__", None); t is not None and t in Sequence._abc_cache'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.663 usec per loop
```
