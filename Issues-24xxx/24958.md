Part of this code was broken on Python 2 as well.  In this case the `Mod(...)` constructor was actually ignoring the first argument, and second argument was compared to integers as though it were an int (which Python 2 allows, but Python 3 doesn't), but the comparison was not necessarily correct.

In the case of `FiniteField` the `str` argument is not actually a problem, but we still explicitly convert it to an `Integer` here for consistency's sake.
