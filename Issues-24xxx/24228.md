This is the problem with using doctests everywhere.  From a documentation standpoint looking at the repr is more interesting.  It depends, to me, if the test is in an "EXAMPLES" block or a "TESTS" block.  In the former case I think it should be more interesting for reading purposes.

Casual readers of the docs *don't* necessarily know what `...` means in this context.  In many cases it's pretty clear (e.g. trailing ellipses at the end of some long floating point expansion).  But here it's just awkward and ugly.  For the purposes of testing, especially considering that Python 3 is currently not the default (and won't be for still quite a while) it's better to leave existing tests alone *as much as possible* and adapt minor `repr` differences to Python 3 only.
