This is the problem with using doctests everywhere.  From a documentation standpoint looking at the repr is more interesting.  It depends, to me, if the test is in an "EXAMPLES" block or a "TESTS" block.  In the former case I think it should be more interesting for reading purposes.

Casual readers of the docs *don't* necessarily know what `...` means in this context.  In many cases it's pretty clear (e.g. trailing ellipses at the end of some long floating point expansion).  But here it's just awkward and ugly.  For the purposes of testing, especially considering that Python 3 is currently not the default (and won't be for still quite a while) it's better to leave existing tests alone *as much as possible* and adapt minor `repr` differences to Python 3 only.

We're just talking about making a few documentation examples work more easily testable.\n\n\nHow I see your proposal is that we should hide much more of the difference between Python2/3 by making the framework itself more complicated (and thus more prone to bugs). So IMO it is far from bikeshedding. But like I said, I am not opposing your proposal, but instead choosing not to support it.\n\nReally, we should have very minimal tests that honestly need to include a check that has the output type/class there. Some better (and more robust) checks would be to do `isinstance(foo, Bar)`. So I doubt we would really have to have hundreds of cases as you say in[comment:13](#comment%3A13). However, that might require looking a bit at the actual doctest itself, and so it is not so mechanical of a change.",

How I see your proposal is that we should hide much more of the difference between Python2/3 by making the framework itself more complicated (and thus more prone to bugs). So IMO it is far from bikeshedding. But like I said, I am not opposing your proposal, but instead choosing not to support it.

Really, we should have very minimal tests that honestly need to include a check that has the output type/class there. Some better (and more robust) checks would be to do `isinstance(foo, Bar)`. So I doubt we would really have to have hundreds of cases as you say in[comment:13](#comment%3A13). However, that might require looking a bit at the actual doctest itself, and so it is not so mechanical of a change.

Perhaps in that case we could revert those changes.  I meant to put the other tickets for that on hold as well...
