When computing the points in the kernel set of the isogeny, it is unnecessary and slow to perform the computation of P.order(): slow because computing the order requires factoring the order of E in many cases, and unnecessary because the preceding code block checks that P has finite order, and in the finite order case we can just compute all multiples of P until we get the identity since we need to compute all of these points anyway in order to list the kernel set. For curves of cryptographic size and kernels of small order, we have measured that eliminating the P.order() computation makes the EllipticCurveIsogeny function run 200 times faster.

I (David) discussed this problem with William Stein and Kevin Lui at JMM 2017, and Kevin identified the source of the problem, but seems to have never checked in a fix.

Keywords: elliptic curve, isogeny

I changed a few small things:

1) Fixed a line in doctest so that it works with sphnix.

2) Removed the multiples import and removed list.

Is there a smaller example? The current one take me about 75s

Thanks Kevin! Here's a smaller example that takes under 2 seconds with the patch, and still takes a very long time without the patch. (Hopefully integer factorization algorithms in the future will not improve to the point where the second part of the previous sentence becomes false.) I also added a speed optimization in the field creation step to help things along.

```
p = 12 * next_prime(2^246) * next_prime(2^247) - 1
F = FiniteField(p, proof=False)
E = EllipticCurve([F(1), F(0)])
P = E(0).division_points(3)[1]
EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, P)
```

Sorry to bug you again. But is there a even smaller example? I think the doctests are suppose to take under a second. Alternatively, you can flag it as a long test.

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html#run-long-doctests

As a side question, how are you able to come up with these primes?

After this, it should be go to go. Can you set the ticket as 'need review'? and I can give it a positive review.
