```
sage: var('tau')
sage: R = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(2), 'tau').fraction_field()(
....:     tau/(1+tau))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ('cannot convert {!r}/{!r} to an element of {}', tau/(tau + 1), 1, Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in tau over Cyclotomic Field of order 2 and degree 1)
```

There is a `.format` missing in the error message.

(and in fact, I'd prefer that a conversion exists, but only one step at a time ...).

The test that you added would be more clear if you didn't use the name `"tau"` twice. When I first saw the test, I couldn't figure it why it was raising an exception in the first place.

If I do not use `tau` twice, then another error arises:c

```
sage: var('tau')
sage: R = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(2), 'z').fraction_field()(
....:    tau/(1+tau))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: symbol
```

Note that it is also essential for triggering the incorrect error message to take `CyclotomicField(2)` and not `QQ`:

```
sage: var('tau')
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'tau').fraction_field()(
....:    tau/(1+tau))
tau/(tau + 1)
```

So IMHO there some problem in the conversion somewhere which I do not have time to investigate right away. So I decided to at least fix the formating issue and hope that somebody else who knows this code better than me will take care of the rest.
