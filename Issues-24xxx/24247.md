We implement powering in the coercion model. One important difference between powering and other operators is that the most common use case for powering is powering something to an integer exponent.

To deal with this integer powering, we implement an action `IntegerPowAction`. This action calls a special method `_pow_int()` on the element. In other words, `x ^ n` for an integer `n` becomes `x._pow_int(n)`. We also provide a default implementation of `_pow_int` for `MonoidElement` and `RingElement` which uses the square-and-multiply algorithm implemented in `generic_power()`.

For backward compatibility reasons, we also call this action for elements of `IntegerModRing(m)`. In the future, we may rethink what to do here, see #15709.

Apart from this, powering behaves like other binary operators: coercion to a common parent is done if no action is defined.

Note that the 3-argument version of `pow()` is not supported in the coercion model. Only specific types like `Integer` implement it. See also #5082.

Fixing powering for specific parents is not within the scope of this ticket, except where it was needed to fix doctest failures. For example, we fix various serious bugs in powering for `RDF` such as:

```
sage: RDF(0) ^ RDF(-1)
0.0
sage: RDF(-1) ^ RDF(2)
NaN
```

 `__pow__` is harder than most other arithmetic coercions because you sometimes want the exponent to be an integer and sometimes you want full coercion.
 
-To solve this, we first check whether the exponent is "integer-like". If so, we call `_pow_int`. If not, we do the usual coercion.
+To solve this, we essentially do as follows:
+
+1. If the arguments have equal parents, call `_pow_`.

+Furthermore, the 3-argument version of `pow()` is not supported in the coercion model. Only specific types like `Integer` implement it.
 
 This is related to Python 3 (see #16072) because this check for an integer needs to be changed in light of the changes to the `int`/`long` types.

It could be an action. But I don't really understand what you are trying to say.

Are you saying that it should be an action?

Are you saying that there *should not* be a special method like `_pow_int`?

(Note that these are two independent questions)

Yes, on anything with a real or complex analytic structure one probably wants that `x^y` is a shorthand for `exp(log(x)*y)` (although for serious use the latter is much better for understanding subtleties arising from multi-valuedness)

It does look like we might want to handle powering action by integers (no multi-valuedness problem, but may need existence or adjunction of inverses), by rationals, by appropriate completions of rationals as different actions, because of their different problems.

In principle, on a commutative multiplicative group of exponent `N` we'd even have a powering action by `ZZ/N ZZ`. I'm not so sure it's worth supporting that explicitly, though.

A lot of points are raised here.

First of all, the point of this ticket is *making possible* various ways of implementing powering in various parents, not to actually implement it that way. For example, I don't plan to re-implement powering for `QQbar` in this ticket. What is within the scope of this ticket is *making it possible* to implement a parent which treats powering by rationals in a specific way (by going through the coercion model which checks for actions and this `QQbar^QQ` powering should be an action).

Second, I do agree that powering by integers is special enough that there should be a default action (as suggested by Nils) which calls the special method `_pow_int`.

Third, I think that coercing to a common parent does make sense because:

1. It is consistent with all other operators. Often multiplication is treated as an action too. Still, when no action is found, coercion to a common parent is done.

2. There are several parents where a common parent for powering makes sense, in particular the various incarnations of real/complex numbers and the symbolic ring.

3. If coercion to a common parent shouldn't be done, then what should be done by default if no action is found?

 To deal with this integer powering, we implement an action `IntegerPowAction`. This action calls a special method `_pow_int()` on the element. In other words, `x ^ n` for an integer `n` becomes `x._pow_int(n)`. We also provide a default implementation of `_pow_int` for `MonoidElement` and `RingElement` which uses the square-and-multiply algorithm implemented in `generic_power()`.

I thought that any operation between a Python type and a Sage parent should coerce everything to Sage. But it seems that this is not done consistently:

```
sage: parent(float(1) + 1)
<type 'float'>
```

For `complex ^ ZZ`, I think that `CDF` also makes sense as an answer: the Sage coercion model replaces `complex` by `CDF` and then does the powering `CDF ^ ZZ`. However, I understand why you would want it to return a `complex`. I'll think about this.

> Also, can we add a test to check that `complex(0,1) ^ int(2)` is consistent?


What do you mean here? That wouldn't use any Sage code.

We probably haven't yet implemented the hooks for floats yet.

> Have you looked at timings?


First of all, it is important to state that this ticket only changes powering for certain parents. It allows to implement powering using the coercion model, but many parents with a custom `__pow__` still have that custom `__pow__` after applying this ticket and won't use the coercion model. This is case for polynomials for example. So we only look at a few parents where the powering actually uses the new code.

Now the timings. The conclusion seems to be that powering for equal parents is slightly faster than before but that powering with non-equal parents is slower than before. This is because the latter goes through the coercion model now.

**ZZ<sup>ZZ</sup>**

Before:

```
sage: a = ZZ(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 122 ns per loop
```

After:

```
sage: a = ZZ(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 110 ns per loop
```

**GF(2<sup>n</sup>)<sup>ZZ</sup>**

Before:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(4, impl="ntl"); n = 2; timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 377 ns per loop
```

After:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(4, impl="ntl"); n = 2; timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 607 ns per loop
```

**RDF<sup>RDF</sup>**

Before:

```
sage: a = RDF(2); n = RDF(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 139 ns per loop
```

After:

```
sage: a = RDF(2); n = RDF(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 132 ns per loop
```

**RDF<sup>ZZ</sup>**

Before:

```
sage: a = RDF(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 156 ns per loop
```

After:

```
sage: a = RDF(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)
100000 loops, best of 20: 240 ns per loop
```

**ideal<sup>ZZ</sup>**

Before:

```
sage: a = ZZ.ideal(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 13.2 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: a = ZZ.ideal(2); n = ZZ(2); timeit('a ^ n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 14.6 µs per loop
```

Copying from [comment:34]:


I think that coercing to a common parent does make sense because:

1. It is consistent with all other operators. Often multiplication is treated as an action too. Still, when no action is found, coercion to a common parent is done.

2. There are several parents where a common parent for powering makes sense, in particular the various incarnations of real/complex numbers and the symbolic ring.

3. If coercion to a common parent shouldn't be done, then what should be done by default if no action is found?
