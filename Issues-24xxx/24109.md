It seems that none of the `bad_parent_warnings` warnings is triggered in the Sage library, so we can make this check unconditional. When the check fails, a deprecation warning is raised.

This fixes #21353.

An error of course.

I meant to say that the option is *currently* ignored. This is to contrast with the typical case for deprecation, where an option is still supported but deprecated. I can improve the wording if you wish.
