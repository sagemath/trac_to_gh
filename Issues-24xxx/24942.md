Move the root finding code of polynomial ring over SR from the generic method `roots` in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` to the specialized `_roots_univariate_polynomial` that has to be put directly in the base ring `SR` (code in `symbolic/ring.pyx`).

Although this is a straight move, with addition of two examples, now 3 doctests fail:

```
File "src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx", line 227, in sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing._element_constructor_
Failed example:
    a + sin(x)
Expected:
    I*sqrt(3) + sin(x)
Got:
    sin(x) + 1.732050807568878?*I
```

```
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 7038, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.roots
Failed example:
    f.roots(SR)
Expected:
    [(-I*sqrt(2), 1), (I*sqrt(2), 1)]
Got:
    []
```

```
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 7040, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.roots
Failed example:
    f.roots(SR, multiplicities=False)
Expected:
    [-I*sqrt(2), I*sqrt(2)]
Got:
    []
```
There must be some fuzziness on if SR is the base ring, or the ring argument of roots().

The following is wrong

```
-        if hasattr(K, '_roots_univariate_polynomial'):

You do want to delegate to the base ring of the polynomial (not to the target for the roots). You can check that at the end of the `roots` code there is

I am not sure we want to support the `ring` argument when different from `None`/`SR`. Do you? If so, you should add proper examples.

BTW, in the doctest `(x^2 + x + 1).roots(SR)` the `SR` should not be needed.

Agree with ignoring the ring argument. Here is a problem:

```
sage: QQbar(sqrt(2)).minpoly().change_ring(SR)
x^2 - 2
sage: _.coefficients()
[x^2 - 2]
```
That is, the result from `change_ring(SR)` has degree 0. Is this expected?

Another bug (mostly disjoint from this ticket)

```
sage: PSR = SR['x']
sage: PSR('x^2 - 1').degree()   # fine
2
sage: PSR([-1, 0, 1]).degree()  # fine
2
sage: PSR(polygen(ZZ)^2 - 1).degree()  # weird!
0
```
I guess that the `_element_constructor` of `PolynomialRing` has to be blame here. The point is that `SR` is able to merge `x^2 - 1` in its base ring so the the constructor get confused. We should special case when the input is a univariate polynomial. But please in another ticket.

`_roots_univariate_polynomial` is a method of the base ring not of the polynomial. That being said, the code in `radical_expression` would better be changed to

```diff
- roots = poly.roots(SR, multiplicities=False)
+ roots = poly.change_ring(SR).roots(multiplicities=False)

Conversion from ZZ can already be improved

```
sage: a = ZZ(23)
sage: %timeit SR(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.51 µs per loop
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 218 ns per loop
```
which is basically the same x15 ratio as in

```
sage: p = polygen(ZZ)^2 + 1
sage: %timeit p.change_ring(SR)
1000 loops, best of 3: 322 µs per loop
sage: %timeit p.change_ring(RR)
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.9 µs per loop
```

These are different operations. You seem to confuse polynomials with coefficients in SR like `SR['x'].gen()^2 + 1` and the corresponding element of SR `SR.var('x')^2 + 1`.

If you have a polynomial `p`, the operations `SR(p)` and `p.change_ring(SR)` are different. In the second case, you change the ring of the coefficients. Not the fact that it is a Sage polynomial.

The biggest part (230µs) of these 300µs is spent in `Expression.__nonzero__` disproving `x^2 + 1 == 0`. So again, it's calling the wrong function when comparing an expression with zero, that leads to performance issues. You can easily confirm this by inserting `return False` at the start of `Expression.__nonzero__` which brings the time down to 70µs.

sage: x = polygen(SR)

```
Now if you convert first to `SR` as a symbolic expression you get 0. Which is certainly not what you want.

My conclusion (for now): SR is terribly intrusive and does not play nicely with anything else from Sage.

You can at least give your opinion. "My" solution consists in removing three lines of code in `SymbolicRing._coerce_map_from_`
