We are following Maxima's lead here:

```
(%i3) solve(1.0 * x^2 - 1.5*x + 2.0, x);

rat: replaced 2.0 by 2/1 = 2.0

rat: replaced -1.5 by -3/2 = -1.5

rat: replaced 1.0 by 1/1 = 1.0
                        sqrt(23) %i - 3      sqrt(23) %i + 3
(%o3)            [x = - ---------------, x = ---------------]
                               4                    4
```
Note that our documentation states: `Whenever possible, answers will be symbolic, but with systems of equations, at times approximations will be given by Maxima, due to the underlying algorithm`.

The workaround would be to use SymPy:

```
sage: solve(1.0 * x^2 - 1.5*x + 2.0, x, algorithm='sympy')
[x == (0.750000000000000 - 1.19895788082818*I),
 x == (0.750000000000000 + 1.19895788082818*I)]
sage: solve(1.13157771r * x^2 - 1.2241351312r*x + 2.0000401231r, x, algorithm='s
....: ympy')
[x == (0.540897509902347 - 1.21445837087478*I),
 x == (0.540897509902347 + 1.21445837087478*I)]

Though it make no sense in the present situation! And the meaning of "symbolic" is anyway very vague.

This code in `polynomial_element.pyx` is numerically unstable. You should not try to reinvent the wheel here

```
sage: coeffs = [85.37r, -59.22r, 10.27r]
sage: RDFx = RDF['x']
sage: pRDF = RDFx(coeffs)
sage: r1, r2 = pRDF.roots(multiplicities=False)
sage: coeffs[2] * r1^2 + coeffs[1] * r1 + coeffs[0]
0.0
```
the same with SR

```
sage: coeffs = [85.37r, -59.22r, 10.27r]
sage: SRx = SR['x']
sage: pSR = SRx(coeffs)
sage: r1, r2 = pSR.roots(multiplicities=False)
sage: coeffs[2] * r1^2 + coeffs[1] * r1 + coeffs[0]
1.4210854715202004e-14
```

Moreover having `import SR` any time `roots` is called is slowing down everything and is a very bad practice. You should have used the special method `_roots_univariate_polynomial` that has to be implemented directly into the ring. See #24942.

Actually, this is not only true for `SR` but for some other rings as well! This `roots` code is a mess...
