This ticket proposes to run the doctests on [GitLab](GitLab).

On GitLab, I would like to run the --new and --short doctests and if these pass also run the --long ones (Without explicit confirmation, as it is easier to get additional runners on GitLab CI.)

<a id='comment:6'></a>One thing Sage desperately needs is a "short" test suite for quick smoke tests--maybe not achieving quite as high coverage but still a lot.

Actually what we really need is better (any) coverage analysis.  That's something that's been high on my TODO list (among other things high on that list), and is probably a bit challenging to get working right.

No, except for variations in timing which make the system run more or less doctest, this is deterministic.

Yes, I already run --new. A dependency graph would be awesome of course and much more relevant.
