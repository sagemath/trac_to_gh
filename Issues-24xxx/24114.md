As mentioned in this [thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/eh3OgZ8jQM4), for a finite field `K` obtained as a quotient polynomial ring `K.list()` is not available.  It is used in the following

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
f = x^2 + x + 2
K.<a> = f.root_field()
H = Matrix(K,[[1,2,1],[2*a+1,a,1]]) # dummy example
C = codes.from_parity_check_matrix(H)
D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C)
D.syndrome_table() 
```

We just change `K.list()` to `list(K)` that just works.
