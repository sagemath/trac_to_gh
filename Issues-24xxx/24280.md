On the website reflections.swarthmore.edu, we have implemented a model builder for Cayley graphs of low-rank reflection groups in a series of SageCells. We would like to use this code to create an experimental package.

Hi,

I had a look at the code, here are already some things to have a look at:

- The module should follow the general coding convention of sage, for example the indentation:

```
EXAMPLES:

Basic plot of a reflection group::     <---- double colon here.
             <------ line break here
    sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',3])                             # optional - gap3
    Irreducible real reflection group of rank 3 and type A3
    sage: w = ReflectionGroup(['A',3])                         # optional - gap3
    sage: ReflectionGroup3d(w)
    Rigid graphical representation of Irreducible real reflection group of rank 3 and type A3
    sage: g = ReflectionGroup3d(w)
    sage: g.plot3d()
    Graphics3d Object
```

for more details, see here https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/#writing-code-for-sage . Further, the first line of test above is not needed.

- The code should also try to follow pep8 conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

- The examples given in the documentation should work out-of-the-box, that is, running `sage -t sage/src/sage/plot/plot3d/reflection_group3d.py` should not return failures (currently has 120, for example, you should not forget to import the relevant function like `ReflectionGroup` in the preamble of the file.)

- The name of the class is perhaps not so well-chosen, perhaps `cayley_graph3d`? Which leads to a potential follow-up question: could this work eventually for general groups?

- General question: do you really need `gap3`? You can require `gap3`, but then should be nice to the user and say it at in the docstring of the module.

- Sage does not usually privilege the usage of user warnings. It should be explained in the docstring of the function what is done, with an example.

- About the Jmol bug, could you give a minimal working instance of the bug?

That's what I can see for now. If you could work on the above list, then I can continue to give feedback once new versions come along!

Best,
JP

The problem is that having

`warnings.simplefilter("always")`

which is meant to bring up warnings for 3 specific doc-tests is causing a normal doc-test to throw hundreds of warnings. Removing that import just causes those 3 specific doc-tests to return a blank line instead of a warning, so that 3 doc-tests will just be modified/removed.

Hi,

without the `gap3` optional package, I still get 3 doctest failures:

```
File "reflection_group3d.py", line 63, in sage.plot.plot3d.reflection_group3d
Failed example:
    g_plot = cayley_graph_3d(A1A1, point=(21,11,31))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:warning


File "reflection_group3d.py", line 212, in sage.plot.plot3d.reflection_group3d.cayley_graph_3d._real_dimension
Failed example:
    A = cayley_graph_3d(W)

File "reflection_group3d.py", line 213, in sage.plot.plot3d.reflection_group3d.cayley_graph_3d._real_dimension
Failed example:
    A.real_dimension
Exception raised:
```

The last two are caused by a missing flag `# optional - gap3`.

Question: are those warnings `_really_` important? This is not typical to have warnings issued to the user like this in Sage.

Instead, perhaps writing a warning block inside of the class to tell the user what the hidden behavior is might be a good idea, as suggested by the Sage Developer's manual:
