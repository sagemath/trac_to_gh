Is this really ready for review?
I'm a little confused as to what this is meant to do, is it meant to match Magma's FaltingsHeight? For example in Magma V2.22-6

```c
> E := EllipticCurve("32a");
> E;
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 4*x over Rational Field
> FaltingsHeight(E);
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
```
quite different from the output this ticket gives, and the code in Magma is a lot more involved, picks a minimal model, uses the denominator of the j-invariant, discriminant etc.

The Magma documentation leaves a lot to be desired here I think.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>\nI forgot the web calculator exists so I only checked it against MagmaV2.18-5. And in that version, the height was dependent on the model which was rather confusing to me. I always worked with the minimal model anyways so that difference didn't matter to me.\n\nI'm happy to see that that has changed:\n\n```\nE := EllipticCurve(\"32a\");\nFaltingsHeight(E);\nFaltingsHeight(WeierstrassModel(E));\n```\nyields\n\n```\n-1.31053292591150951825227508330\n-1.31053292591150951825227508330\n```\nusing http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ .\n\nMy interest in Faltings height is using Steven's conjecture to identify the J_1(N)-optimal curve in a given isogeny class. So the goal of this ticket was the compute whatever height is used in Steven's conjecture. So I took what was defined in Remark 3.3 here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404333.pdf and re-normalized it so that it matched with Magma. Though now I'm not sure what Magma is computing anymore.

I forgot the web calculator exists so I only checked it against MagmaV2.18-5. And in that version, the height was dependent on the model which was rather confusing to me. I always worked with the minimal model anyways so that difference didn't matter to me.

I'm happy to see that that has changed:

```
E := EllipticCurve("32a");
FaltingsHeight(E);
FaltingsHeight(WeierstrassModel(E));
```
yields

```
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
```
using http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ .

My interest in Faltings height is using Steven's conjecture to identify the J_1(N)-optimal curve in a given isogeny class. So the goal of this ticket was the compute whatever height is used in Steven's conjecture. So I took what was defined in Remark 3.3 here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404333.pdf and re-normalized it so that it matched with Magma. Though now I'm not sure what Magma is computing anymore. It seems to different than what's documented here: https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/1455

In any case, I should change it so that it uses the minimal model.
