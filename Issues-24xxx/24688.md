Is this really ready for review?
I'm a little confused as to what this is meant to do, is it meant to match Magma's FaltingsHeight? For example in Magma V2.22-6

```c
> E := EllipticCurve("32a");
> E;
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 4*x over Rational Field
> FaltingsHeight(E);
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
```
quite different from the output this ticket gives, and the code in Magma is a lot more involved, picks a minimal model, uses the denominator of the j-invariant, discriminant etc.

The Magma documentation leaves a lot to be desired here I think.

I forgot the web calculator exists so I only checked it against MagmaV2.18-5. And in that version, the height was dependent on the model which was rather confusing to me. I always worked with the minimal model anyways so that difference didn't matter to me.

I'm happy to see that that has changed:

```
E := EllipticCurve("32a");
FaltingsHeight(E);
FaltingsHeight(WeierstrassModel(E));
```
yields

```
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
-1.31053292591150951825227508330
```
using http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ .

My interest in Faltings height is using Steven's conjecture to identify the J_1(N)-optimal curve in a given isogeny class. So the goal of this ticket was the compute whatever height is used in Steven's conjecture. So I took what was defined in Remark 3.3 here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404333.pdf and re-normalized it so that it matched with Magma. Though now I'm not sure what Magma is computing anymore. It seems to different than what's documented here: https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/1455

In any case, I should change it so that it uses the minimal model.

I think I'm being slow but I don't see how knowing the BSD invariants help with computing the Faltings height.

I merged the previous branch with 9.3.beta9, and enhanced the method by having `stable` as an optional parameter (default `False`) and adding a precision parameter.  I added extra tests to show how the stable and unstable heights are the same for semistable curves (but not otherwise) and how the stable height is independent of the model while the unstable one is not.

I included definitions (but no citations).

Obviously we'll also want a version of this for number fields too, but I think this is enough for now.  Please re-review!
