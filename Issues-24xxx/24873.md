<a id='comment:14'></a>I am happy with the ticket. I checked all the methods which refereed to my recent paper and they do what they're supposed to. I didn't check the "modern" methods referring to Baptist's paper but I trust you on that.

I also checked the documentation and tested the file.

As we are both set as authors, do we need another reviewer? Or can we give it a "positive review" if we're both happy?

Anyway, I let you have a look at my small changes.
