Yes, several others with `interpolation="clough"` take hundreds of seconds. I'll give you more details later today.

The easiest speed up is to replace `clough` by `linear` but plot will actually lose in "quality". `clough` gives very nice and smooth plots. I think `nn` may have been caching an intermediate step that speeds things considerably when a lot of points are involved.

OK.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A3):

Probably not the upgrade, just tachyon being slow.

That warrants examination in whatever case. 4s in 2011 to 49s in 2018 with probably newer hardware.

Uncertain.

Those two are prime suspect as they both use `clough` in the second case because it is the default.

Nothing involving MPL directly, this is probably something else. That's certainly a long test.

How old is your hardware that's what I get locally

For normal plots you can iterate over the elements, which is usually a reasonably detailed textual representation 

```
sage: g1 = plot([x*exp(-n*x^2)/.4 for n in [1..3]], (0, 2), color='blue', aspect_ratio=.8)
sage: list(g1)
[Line defined by 210 points,
 Line defined by 221 points,
 Line defined by 219 points]
```
There is no similar solution for 3d plots afair.

Reducing the output resolution of tachyon would be fine with me; we don't test anything by raytracing big images instead of small ones except possibly for our patience.
