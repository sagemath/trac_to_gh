First of all, ensure that `subprocess32` is not built on Python 3.

Second, port it to Solaris (and other exotic platforms): `subprocess32` is a backport from Python3. They backported the C sources but not the `configure` script which defines macros like `HAVE_DIRFD`. So this can never work and leads to breakage:

**Upstream**: https://github.com/google/python-subprocess32/issues/40

I'm adding a very Sage-specific fix, namely to re-use the `pyconfig.h` from Python 3 to compile this.

<a id='comment:2'></a>On Solaris 11, one has `dirfd()`, and 

```
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DHAVE_DIRFD" ./sage -i subprocess32
```
works. The problem with the source is that it provides a (hacky) workaround for older Solaris systems, that lack `dirfd()`, but do not check for the version.

I don't know why  `HAVE_DIRFD` is not defined by Solaris, it might be a GNUism, in fact.

`subprocess32` is a backport from Python3. They backported the C sources but not the `configure` script which defines macros like `HAVE_DIRFD`. So this can never work...
