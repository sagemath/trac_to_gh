It says "minimal", but computes "maximal". The latter actually makes sense, as the unweighted case by right computes a longest path.

This was reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/QLSPBLK4fek/rjdtNhcUCAAJ).

This patch introduces a new implementation of the hamiltonian path method that fixes several bugs and enables to compute both a minimum or maximum weight hamiltonian path.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
While playing with the `hamiltonian_path` method, I found the following bug:

```
sage: H = Graph([(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1)])
sage: H.hamiltonian_path(use_edge_labels=1, s=0, t=2)
(0, None)
sage: H.longest_path(use_edge_labels=1, s=0, t=2)
(3, Subgraph of (): Graph on 2 vertices)
```
A hamiltonian path in H is `[0, 1, 3, 2]` and has weight 3. The `longest_path` method also finds a path between 0 to 2 of weight 3, but it has only 1 edge and so is not hamiltonian.

Given this bug, I propose to stop calling longest path when searching for a hamiltonian path.

This way, it will also be easier to find a hamiltonian path of minimum or maximum weight.
I will push a branch soon.

Value of `algorithm` is not tested, so `g.hamiltonian_path(algorithm="junk")` is accepted. I don't know if this makes an error now, but it is kind of time-bomb for future changes.

(Not the only place in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) with missing test like this...)

E: Also "We modify the graph to search for a Hamiltonian Cycle starting from" should be Hamiltonian path, not cycle.

E2: Typo "paramter".

I tried to better explain how I turn the hamiltonian path problem into a hamiltonian cycle problem. Hope it's easier to understand now.

Roughly, If the source (resp. destination) is not given, I add a fake source (resp. destination) and an arc from it to each vertex in the (di)graph (resp. from each vertex of the (di)graph to it). Then I add an extra vertex to force in the cycle the subpath [source, extra vertex, destination] in this order.
