We can adapt the `Braid.left_normal_form` into a general method for finite type Artin groups. In the process, we introduce an ABC `ArtinGroup` and make both `BraidGroup_class` and `RightAngledArtinGroup` as subclasses (and similarly for element classes). We fix a few bugs along the way as well (comparisons of RAAG elements are broken)

Have you compared the speed of the new implementation of left normal form with the previous one for braids?

Thank you.

No, I have not, but I think it should be the same since it is the same algorithm as before.

Actually, there is a speed gain, but only because I am now using `simple_reflections`, which does not recreate the s<sub>i</sub> used in the algorithm:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: b = B([1,4,-3,-2,3,1,-4,2,1,2,1,2,3,-2,1,-2,-1,3,4,-3,-4])
sage: %timeit b._left_normal_form_coxeter()
100 loops, best of 3: 7.8 ms per loop
sage: bp = B([1,4,-3])
sage: %timeit bp._left_normal_form_coxeter()
1000 loops, best of 3: 534 µs per loop
```
vs old

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: b = B([1,4,-3,-2,3,1,-4,2,1,2,1,2,3,-2,1,-2,-1,3,4,-3,-4])
sage: %timeit b._left_normal_form_perm_()
100 loops, best of 3: 15.1 ms per loop
sage: bp = B([1,4,-3])
sage: %timeit bp._left_normal_form_perm_()
