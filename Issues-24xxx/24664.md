Have you compared the speed of the new implementation of left normal form with the previous one for braids?

Thank you.

> Have you compared the speed of the new implementation of left normal form with the previous one for braids?


No, I have not, but I think it should be the same since it is the same algorithm as before.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Actually, there is a speed gain, but only because I am now using `simple_reflections`, which does not recreate the s<sub>i</sub> used in the algorithm:

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: b = B([1,4,-3,-2,3,1,-4,2,1,2,1,2,3,-2,1,-2,-1,3,4,-3,-4])
sage: %timeit b._left_normal_form_coxeter()

sage: bp = B([1,4,-3])
sage: %timeit bp._left_normal_form_coxeter()
1000 loops, best of 3: 534 µs per loop
```
vs old

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: b = B([1,4,-3,-2,3,1,-4,2,1,2,1,2,3,-2,1,-2,-1,3,4,-3,-4])

sage: bp = B([1,4,-3])
sage: %timeit bp._left_normal_form_perm_()
