We organize linbox declarations (`sage/libs/linbox/`) and make the Sage code almost independent of the `interfaces/sage` that is in linbox (see #26178 for the last step).

Switching from `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<unsigned int>>` to `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<int64_t>>` presented some compilation issues (see discussion from [comment:43 comment:43]). That will be dealt with in #26178.

(see also #22872 for the linbox task ticket)

Some upstream reports to linbox and Cython

- [Cython bug 1 (RuntimeError)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/FYIh0OZ1qeE) (not relevant anymore)
- [Cython bug 2 (cimported module vs typedef in classes)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/81wTNLKZ2mw) (not relevant anymore)
- [LinBox issue](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/105) (solve is broken for rectangular matrices)
- [LinBox issue 117](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/117) (givaro modular field using `uint64_t`)

I don't care that strongly. I am so used to seeing the Sage-formatted docstrings, it took me a little bit of extra time to mentally parse it. So if you are opposed to such a change, then I am okay to call it bikeshedding and move on.

The pxd file only contains C declarations and is hence compatible with Cython C files compiled with `gcc` not `g++`. I don't know whether it makes a difference but as flint is a pure C library I thought it would be better this way.
