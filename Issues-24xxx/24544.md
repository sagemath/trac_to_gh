We organize linbox declarations (`sage/libs/linbox/`) and make the Sage code almost independent of the `interfaces/sage` that is in linbox (see #26178 for the last step).

Switching from `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<unsigned int>>` to `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<int64_t>>` presented some compilation issues (see discussion from [comment:43](#comment%3A43)). That will be dealt with in #26178.

(see also #22872 for the linbox task ticket)

Some upstream reports to linbox and Cython

- [Cython bug 1 (RuntimeError)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/FYIh0OZ1qeE) (not relevant anymore)
- [Cython bug 2 (cimported module vs typedef in classes)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/81wTNLKZ2mw) (not relevant anymore)
- [LinBox issue](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/105) (solve is broken for rectangular matrices)
- [LinBox issue 117](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/117) (givaro modular field using `uint64_t`)

See the attached branch for an experimental version. All tests pass on my computer. Though many tests in `sage/matrix/linbox_solver_modn_sparse.pyx` are there for showing potential bugs in linbox `solve`.

Why the explicit `PyInt_FromLong` here?

```
return PyInt_FromLong(A_rank)

Cython knows how to convert a `long` to a Python object.
