Complete log is attached.

The reason is that the libc++ directive is meant for linking commands using clang++. It should be filtered out when using gfortran as linker.

From a quick look at #24716, it seems that the bug is in NTL upstream. Globally setting `LDFLAGS` to something involving C++ libraries seems wrong because `LDFLAGS` is not specific to C++.

Anyway, if you want to reopen this ticket, I would like a good explanation why you need to change `LDFLAGS` globally.
