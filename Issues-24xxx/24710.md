Complete log is attached.

The reason is that the libc++ directive is meant for linking commands using clang++. It should be filtered out when using gfortran as linker.

From a quick look at #24716, it seems that the bug is in NTL upstream. Globally setting `LDFLAGS` to something involving C++ libraries seems wrong because `LDFLAGS` is not specific to C++.

Anyway, if you want to reopen this ticket, I would like a good explanation why you need to change `LDFLAGS` globally.

Without doing something about stdlib, Sage simply doesn't build for me with clang. That has of course been the first thing that I tried.

Thanks for testing it all on Ubuntu. So I think we can close this and recommend clang-4 with the flags `CC=clang CXX=clang++`.
