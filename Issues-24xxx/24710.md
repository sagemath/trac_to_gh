Complete log is attached.

The reason is that the libc++ directive is meant for linking commands using clang++. It should be filtered out when using gfortran as linker.

From a quick look at #24716, it seems that the bug is in NTL upstream. Globally setting `LDFLAGS` to something involving C++ libraries seems wrong because `LDFLAGS` is not specific to C++.

Anyway, if you want to reopen this ticket, I would like a good explanation why you need to change `LDFLAGS` globally.

Indeed libc++ does not seem necessary after all, #24701 may be a problem of the clang version or of the libstdc++ version. My mistake was after the initial #24701 I changed two things at once (clang version and stdlib) and assumed the wrong of the two produced success.

Without doing something about stdlib, Sage simply doesn't build for me with clang. That has of course been the first thing that I tried.

But you didn't change your clang version, right? So how do you know your problem was only because of your missing libc++ flag? At that time I suggested so but I was wrong. ptestlong with clang-4/libstdc++ is fine here, as I just saw.
