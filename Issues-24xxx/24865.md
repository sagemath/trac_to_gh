```
This is unexpected:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(4)
sage: matrix(a, nrows=2, ncols=2)
[0 1]
[1 1]
```
because one would typically expect a scalar matrix instead:

```
sage: R.<a> = EisensteinIntegers()
sage: matrix(a, nrows=2, ncols=2)
[a 0]
[0 a]
```
This is because finite field elements implement `_matrix_` and this takes priority in the matrix constructor.

Proposal: rename `_matrix_` to `matrix` to make it usable as ordinary method.
