From ​https://www.csun.edu/~ctoth/Handbook/chap15.pdf:

The join of two polytopes `P` (of dimension d) and `Q` (of dimension d') is the (d+d'+1)-polytope obtained as the convex hull of `P\cup Q` after
embedding P and Q in a space where their affine hulls are skew.

<a id='comment:3'></a>According to the developer guide:

- the docstring should start with a one line sentence. Then a line break, then a longer description.

- better than `- ``other`` -- a :class:`Polyhedron_base`.`, I would just use `- ``other`` -- a polyhedron`.

- there is no need to fill an OUTPUT section as it is already described before.


And I would like to see the definition of a "skew subspace".


This is not the proper thing to do

```
        try:
            new_ring = self.parent()._coerce_base_ring(other)
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError("no common canonical parent for objects with parents: " + str(self.parent())
                     + " and " + str(other.parent()))
```
You should try to coerce the objects to a common parent as in

```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: I = polytopes.icosahedron()
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.common_parent(C, I)
Polyhedra in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5)^3
```
And even simpler, you could use the decorator ``@`coerce_binop` from `sage.structure.element`.

Moreover, when you construct the resulting polytope you should just use directly the common parent.

I added a short definition.

Unfortunately, doing the join changes the dimension, and hence the parents.

Merci!

Indeed, I added a test and an unbounded example.

Coercion can not be used since the dimension is included in the parent of Polyhedron objects and they can be different and the output also has a different dimension:

```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: S = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: C.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^3
sage: S.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^2
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.common_parent(C,S)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Polyhedra in ZZ^3' and 'Polyhedra in ZZ^2'
```

That's the explanation of the short sentence I gave above...
