To express solution sets from solvers an expression-is-element-of-set relation is needed. For ease of implementation this can be made a formal function `element_of`. 

It depends on sets being made coercible into SR.  The present ticket plays safe and only does this for finite sets and a few standard infinite sets: `NN`, `ZZ`, `QQ`, `AA`; and `RealSet`s.

`element_of` converts to SymPy's `Contains`. This is useful in combination with #31931, which adds SymPy conversions to some of the above sets.

Very sadly, no!

My dream is:

1. rename `RealField(prec)` -> `RealFloatingPointField_mpfr(prec)`
2. rename `RealLazyField` -> `RealComputableField` and `RLF -> RCF`
3. create a class `RealField()` to model (abstractly) the set of real numbers
4. rename `RR` -> `RFPF`

The reason for 2./3. is that we want to distinguish between the field of all real numbers (denoted `RR` in math literature) and the field of [computable numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number) (which is a countable subfield). An element of `RCF` would simply be a computer program that gives access to the digit expansion of a number. It should provide access to all mathematical constants like `pi`, `e`, etc and most transcendental functions. A serious problem about `RCF` is that the equality is not decidable... but we can not avoid it.

The set of real numbers (my number 3. in the list) would not implement anything serious. It would only act as an abstract set that can be obtained as the metric completion of `QQ`. It could be used as a building block for more advanced structures (like manfiolds).

I put 4. apart as it is a serious backward incompatibility.reasons.
