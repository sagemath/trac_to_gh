There is a general problem throughout much of Sage where code checks if some argument is a `list` or `tuple` (e.g. `isinstance(x, (list, tuple))`) where really it should be able to accept any argument which, depending on the context, implements either the `Sequence` protocol, or even just the `Iterable` protocol.

This especially becomes a problem on Python 3 where common built-ins like `map()` and `filter()` now return lazily-evaluated iterators instead of `list`s.

In many cases we've addressed this by replacing `map`/`filter` calls with list comprehensions and that works fine.  But really also ought to make many of these interfaces more flexible in what types they accept.

For some cases simply replacing `(list, tuple)` with `Sequence` is sufficient (basically, this is any object that implements `__iter__` as well as `__len__` and `__getitem__`).  Unfortunately, there are other cases where we don't need the full `Sequence` protocol, and in fact would like to take any iterable (like `map`).

The problem with the latter case is that in most cases what we really want is *finite* iterables.  We don't want to write code that can be passed an infinite generate and hang.  To some extent this is the user's responsibility but we should try as much as possible to prevent it.  If an iterable implements `__len__` then no problem, but `map` and `filter` *do not* (since they can wrap any iterable(s), finite or not).

An even bigger problem is that Python's interface does not allow us to easily introspect `map` or `filter` to see if the iterable's they're wrapping are finite.  In some sense there's no general way to do this with certainty, if you have arbitrarily nested iterables (though I feel that that's a shortcoming in Python).  But for most cases we should be able to check if a `map` or `filter` is finite by looking directly at the iterable(s) they were passed as arguments, so it might be nice to have a C-level helper for that.

What's your point? If the user writes bad code, then bad things can happen. That's a basic axiom of programming. We don't "protect" the user from running

```
L = []
while True:
    L.append(0)
```

Of course, it can often be nice to check the input given by the user. That's what exceptions are for. But here we have the problem that we want to accept certain input where we cannot a priori determine whether it's good (finite) or bad (infinite). So there are two "solutions":

1. Your solution: only accept input which can be proven good. This means breaking certain meaningful use cases.

2. My solution: accept all input and assume that it's good. This puts the burden on the user not to do anything stupid.

The problem with iterators, and especially generators, is that their behavior can be extremely obscured.  If you have an explicit `while True:` it's obvious to see, and no one would write it.  But it's quite easy (and this comes up a lot especially in coroutine-based programming) where you (the user, but which I also mean a developer) can wind up with some infinite generator buried deep in other generators.

This discussion led in part to the creation of `__length_hint__` though that's more intended just as an optimization for the interpreter to use; it's not, nor is it intended to be, a fix to this problem.  It was just a small concession that's come out of those discussions.

Of course, given some arbitrary code it's impossible to know if it will always terminate, but there are definitely common cases where we can do better than nothing.

> This means breaking certain meaningful use cases.

Like what?

Also, I'll note, there are lots of places in my Python 3 branch where for now I just accept arbitrary iterables where it's possible to.  But this is a concession to the fact that there's often no better way to check finiteness.  The point of this ticket was to talk about adding some simple checks for common cases.  E.g. if it were possible with the `map` object to dig into it and introspect what iterables were passed to it there's a lot one might be able to say, and it's unfortunate that the API doesn't allow that. I believe it should.

It seems to me that a wholesale replacement of these new (py3-only) iterators (e.g. filter()) by iterables (e.g. lists) is not a good idea, as it prevents potential performance optimisations.

Why not just wrapping them with  list() or tuple() instead? It is much less work, and it does not remove the opportunity to optimise later on, if desired.
