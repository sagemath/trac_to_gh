These are packages that use standard autoconf builds (configure && make && make install) that could be easily updated to use the corresponding helper functions, as explained in #24024.

This ticket updates a large number of packages, but the change to all of them is nearly identical.

Are you?  I'll note that these changes are all extracted from #22509 which I'm working on breaking up into multiple smaller steps, but the branch in #22509 has already gone through quite a lot of testing.

The only thing I'm sure of is it's worth checking what open tickets this conflicts with, of which I'm sure there are some.

I would rather prefer to see all those packages receiving a version bump, to avoid trouble.

Also, some random quick comments:

1. `libfplll`: conflicts with #24042: just postpone `libfplll` to a new ticket.

2. `libpng`: I don't want to think about `$DESTDIR` for now, please revert that.

3. `mpfr`: one `./configure` command is intentionally not checked I believe.

4. `ppl`: just use `./configure` instead of `sdh_configure` if you don't want the functionality of `sdh_configure`.

5. `zlib`: use `ZLIB_CONFIGURE` instead of `CONFIGUREFLAGS` to be consistent with other packages.

If you disagree with any of the above, I would much rather prefer to postpone the given package to a new ticket and only deal on this ticket with the packages where we agree. Otherwise we will never make progress.

Okay--that will probably introduce more potential conflicts though; e.g. with #23700.  I could postpone some of those, or help get those tickets done more quickly if possible...

> Also, some random quick comments:
>

I don't see any reason to postpone it to a new ticket.  In particular, since #24042 is already closed I can just merge it into this.
 
> 2. `libpng`: I don't want to think about `$DESTDIR` for now, please revert that.


Oops--yes, my intention was to leave out anything to do with DESTDIR.  I missed that one.

> 3. `mpfr`: one `./configure` command is intentionally not checked I believe.


Right--I think originally I had that correct, but when I was checking this patch over I initially thought it was something I missed and updated it.  Now you've reminded me that it was intentionally allowed to fail.

> 4. `ppl`: just use `./configure` instead of `sdh_configure` if you don't want the functionality of `sdh_configure`.


The functionality of `sdh_configure` isn't just the error checking.  But I'll see if there's a different approach I can take to that case that doesn't require a sub-shell.  Maybe I'll leave ppl and mpfr out of this ticket for now.

> 5. `zlib`: use `ZLIB_CONFIGURE` instead of `CONFIGUREFLAGS` to be consistent with other packages.


+1

> If you disagree with any of the above, I would much rather prefer to postpone the given package to a new ticket and only deal on this ticket with the packages where we agree. Otherwise we will never make progress.


Agreed--with the exception of `libfplll` where I'm not sure why you propose a separate ticket.

I am wondering if this could be split and included quickly. That way, separately from a big push for all packages I and other can already start migrating when upgrading packages. 

For example I am thinking on working on #22836 - it will conflict with this ticket. But instead of just upgrading I think I could use the opportunity to migrate. It would be more useful if the above commit was already available.

It turns out that flint is not actually a real autoconf'd package, and has a hand-written custom `configure` script which doesn't support `--libdir`.

I might do something about that, but in the meantime it should be dropped from this ticket.

First of all, I think it is a bad idea to change a ticket back to positive_review just because of that question. As I explained in [comment:21], we have the most chances of actually making progress if we try to merge what we can and postpone more difficult packages.

Giving positive_review to a part of a ticket which makes sense by itself is something that I have done before and I honestly don't see the problem.

My goal is to actually merge this ticket and I don't understand why you are going against that.

There looks to be an issue with quoting (`"` quotes nested inside `"` quotes). I thought I commented on this already, but I see now that I haven't. Anyway, I'm done with reviewing this ticket.

> Giving positive_review to a part of a ticket which makes sense by itself is something that I have done before and I honestly don't see the problem.


Because you made changes and then set it to "positive review" without consulting.  If anything you should have then set it to "needs review" so that I could review *your* changes.  Otherwise something that I didn't intend might end up getting merged.  It's just presumptuous.

I don't know what issue with zlib you're talking about.  I can't reproduce it.  Maybe if there really is an issue it would be simpler for me to fix it than to just revert the change entirely.
