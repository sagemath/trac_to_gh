These are packages that use standard autoconf builds (configure && make && make install) that could be easily updated to use the corresponding helper functions, as explained in #24024.

This ticket updates a large number of packages, but the change to all of them is nearly identical.

Are you?  I'll note that these changes are all extracted from #22509 which I'm working on breaking up into multiple smaller steps, but the branch in #22509 has already gone through quite a lot of testing.

The only thing I'm sure of is it's worth checking what open tickets this conflicts with, of which I'm sure there are some.

<a id='comment:21'></a>I would rather prefer to see all those packages receiving a version bump, to avoid trouble.

Also, some random quick comments:

1. `libfplll`: conflicts with #24042: just postpone `libfplll` to a new ticket.

2. `libpng`: I don't want to think about `$DESTDIR` for now, please revert that.

3. `mpfr`: one `./configure` command is intentionally not checked I believe.

4. `ppl`: just use `./configure` instead of `sdh_configure` if you don't want the functionality of `sdh_configure`.

5. `zlib`: use `ZLIB_CONFIGURE` instead of `CONFIGUREFLAGS` to be consistent with other packages.

If you disagree with any of the above, I would much rather prefer to postpone the given package to a new ticket and only deal on this ticket with the packages where we agree. Otherwise we will never make progress.

Okay--that will probably introduce more potential conflicts though; e.g. with #23700.  I could postpone some of those, or help get those tickets done more quickly if possible...

> Also, some random quick comments:
> 
> 1. `libfplll`: conflicts with #24042: just postpone `libfplll` to a new ticket.


I don't see any reason to postpone it to a new ticket.  In particular, since #24042 is already closed I can just merge it into this.
 
> 2. `libpng`: I don't want to think about `$DESTDIR` for now, please revert that.


Oops--yes, my intention was to leave out anything to do with DESTDIR.  I missed that one.

> 3. `mpfr`: one `./configure` command is intentionally not checked I believe.


Right--I think originally I had that correct, but when I was checking this patch over I initially thought it was something I missed and updated it.  Now you've reminded me that it was intentionally allowed to fail.

> 4. `ppl`: just use `./configure` instead of `sdh_configure` if you don't want the functionality of `sdh_configure`.


The functionality of `sdh_configure` isn't just the error checking.  But I'll see if there's a different approach I can take to that case that doesn't require a sub-shell.  Maybe I'll leave ppl and mpfr out of this ticket for now.

> 5. `zlib`: use `ZLIB_CONFIGURE` instead of `CONFIGUREFLAGS` to be consistent with other packages.


+1

> If you disagree with any of the above, I would much rather prefer to postpone the given package to a new ticket and only deal on this ticket with the packages where we agree. Otherwise we will never make progress.


Agreed--with the exception of `libfplll` where I'm not sure why you propose a separate ticket.
