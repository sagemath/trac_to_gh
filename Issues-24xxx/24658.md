```
In the case a relation without variables is to be decided, the procedure is to use Pynac, then RIF and, if it cannot be decided, Maxima. This is fine with expressions containing variables as Maxima can do some proofs. Expressions without variables are handled poorly as the example shows:

```
sage: val = pi - 2286635172367940241408/1029347477390786609545*sqrt(2)
sage: bool(val>0)
True

(%i2) is (%pi-(1116521080257783321*2^(23/2))/1029347477390786609545>0);
(%o2)                                true
```

This ticket changes the procedure to no longer try the unreliable Maxima after RIF has failed in a relation without variables. It will just return False.

It should be easy to review (after all, it is just working around a short-coming of maxima), and to me it looks good. However, I do not feel particularly confident about symbolic expressions (which I normally try to avoid by all means).

Also, I wonder about that change:

Because getting what we want (avoid Maxima numeric) and keeping the doctest would need more involved code, basically checking if there are constants, if so substituting them for variables, and then calling Maxima with that. Note that the changed result is not wrong so I'll add it again.

Hm. `(pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2).is_zero()` returning False goes to far, IMHO.

If I understand correctly, the underlying bug is in Maxima's test for positivity/negativity. Is there a corresponding bug in Maxima's test for being zero as well? If it isn't, then I guess one should return to using Maxima for `is_zero`.

Or, alternatively, `is_zero()` (but not `is_trivial_zero()`) should be cleverer in using RIF:

```
sage: RIF(pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2)>0
False
sage: RIF(pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2)<0
False
sage: RIF(pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2)==0
False
sage: RIF(pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2).is_NaN()
False
```

Thus, we have a real **number** (it is not !NaN) that is neither positive nor negative, and thus it would make sense to treat it as zero, although RIF is careful enough to not assert that it actually *is* zero.

Or prepend it by a simplification?

```
sage: RIF((pi + (pi - 1)*pi - pi^2).simplify_full()).is_zero()
True
```

After all, presumably `is_zero()` is supposed to invest more work into testing than `is_trivial_zero()`.

That is probably best. One can always construct cases that need long time like `((pi+1)^10000 - pi*(pi+1)^9999 - (pi+1)^9999).simplify_full()`.

`._is_coercion_cached()` is related with `self._coerce_from_hash`. I think it would be a good idea to create a single underscore method that allows to clear `self._coerce_from_hash` and `self._convert_from_hash`. Proposed name: `_clear_coerce_caches`.
