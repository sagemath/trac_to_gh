The following example has been reported [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39153/edge-color-for-undirected-multiedge-graphs/).
The plot has 4 edges, 2 red and 2 black, while the multi graph has only 2 edges.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1), (0,1)], multiedges=True)
sage: G.plot(edge_colors={"red":[(1,0)]})
```
