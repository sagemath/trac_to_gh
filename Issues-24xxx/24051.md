The following example has been reported [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39153/edge-color-for-undirected-multiedge-graphs/).
The plot has 4 edges, 2 red and 2 black, while the multi graph has only 2 edges.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1), (0,1)], multiedges=True)
sage: G.plot(edge_colors={"red":[(1,0)]})
```

Because of short-circuiting, you can simply do:

```python
                if ((edge[0],edge[1],edge[2]) not in edges_drawn and
                    ( self._graph.is_directed() or
