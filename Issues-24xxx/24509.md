<a id='comment:4'></a>
While I doubt this is an issue, this change:

```diff
-    if data == Infinity:
+    if data is Infinity:
```
is a slight behavior change because

```
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.gen() == Infinity
True
sage: UnsignedInfinityRing.gen() is Infinity
False
```
So if this is okay to you or you revert this change, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.

ok. I have decided to downgrade this ticket to a trivial pep8 ticket.

I have undone the change, back to `data == Infinity`
