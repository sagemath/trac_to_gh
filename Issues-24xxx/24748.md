As discussed in #14549 there is a memory leak in `BooleanPolynomialRing`, which was fixed (somewhat hacky) for the `annihilator` method by using `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor`.

There are other uses of `BooleanPolyonmialRing` which should be fixed, too. I suggest to do this the same way as for `annihilator`. But maybe also add a comment to the code, to link to this and #14549 discussion, so we have a later reference, why these changes exist.

I took a look at the BooleanPolynomialRing implementation and for me to be able to write the correct patch will take some time, as I have to understand how the implementation work (and differs from other ring implementations).

Is there a possibility to close tickets as wontfix or something?
