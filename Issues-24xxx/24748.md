Keywords: memory leak, BooleanFunction

As discussed in #14549 there is a memory leak in `BooleanPolynomialRing`, which was fixed (somewhat hacky) for the `annihilator` method by using `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor`.

There are other uses of `BooleanPolyonmialRing` which should be fixed, too. I suggest to do this the same way as for `annihilator`. But maybe also add a comment to the code, to link to this and #14549 discussion, so we have a later reference, why these changes exist.

I agree, will work on #21892 next when I have some spare time.
But I think that a fix for that can remove this hack accordingly?

I don't see the point of taking on more technical debt when there is a known solution. I know finding spare time is not easy, but it makes it easier (i.e. requires less time) to work with the code base in the long run. Anyways, if someone else wants to set this to a positive review, I will not object, but I am more willing to find time to review the long term fix.

OK, I'm fine with that, too.

I took a look at the BooleanPolynomialRing implementation and for me to be able to write the correct patch will take some time, as I have to understand how the implementation work (and differs from other ring implementations).

Is there a possibility to close tickets as wontfix or something?
