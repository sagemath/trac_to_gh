# Issue 24702: Intersections and saturations of FreeQuadraticModules have the wrong ambient module

sage: L = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,2,matrix.identity(2))
sage: S1 = L.submodule([(1,0)])
sage: S2 = L.submodule([(0,1)])
sage: S1.intersection(S2).ambient_module()
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```
Thus the intersection changes the ambient module. And in particular the inner product. This breaks other things like fgp modules too.

The same holds for saturations.
