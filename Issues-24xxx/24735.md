A patch that makes Sage build with the API changes in 4.1.1 is available at [1]

However, the removal of singclap_pmod and singclap_pdivide for polynomials with integer coefficients [2] causes some regressions:


```
sage: R.<x,y>=ZZ[] 
sage: a=x+y 
sage: b=x-y 
sage: a.gcd(b) 
1 
sage: a.quo_rem(b) 
( 0, x + y ) 
sage: a.gcd(b) 
0 
sage: singular(a).gcd(b) 
1 
```

Pushing WIP patch. Still needs a decision on what to do for `__floordiv__`, gcd and lcm in the integers coefficient case in multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx.

Unfortunately starting from 8.3.beta7 there are many more test failures caused by the upgrade due to #23909

This gives a wrong answer

That is technically correct on Q[x,y] (although the coefficient is strange), but not on ZZ[x,y]. For the lcm, we should probably factor out the contents, take the lcm of the primitive parts over QQ and multiply by the lcm (on Z) of the contents.

There are still many test failures which are unrelated to the sinclap_pdivide issue. They seem caused by singular now returning an warning when computing groebner bases over CC, so Sage falls back to the toy implementation:

```
sage: A.<x,y>=CC[]
sage: I=A.ideal(x-y)
sage: I._groebner_basis_singular()
```
now returns

```
TypeError: Singular error:
// ** groebner base computations with inexact coefficients can not be trusted due to rounding errors
```
With singular 4.1.0 it gives

```
sage: I._groebner_basis_singular()
[x - y]
```

The problem is that the Singular warning
"groebner base computations with inexact coefficients can not be trusted due to rounding errors" matches

```
       if s.find("error") != -1 or s.find("Segment fault") != -1:
```
from singular.py so Sage (incorrectly) throws a SingularError. The test for errors in singular.py should be made more reliable.

The NTL issue is probably related to the NTL upgrade. Especially this line in the singular changelog is interesting:

> port to NTL 10 with threads (needs also C++11: gcc6 or -std=c++11)

No, this is unrelated to the NTL version (I can reproduce both on the Sage distribution with NTL 10.3 and on Arch with NTL 11.2). It is caused by
https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/28d88317

Someone who understands the error handling code should take a look at it

It should be. Unfortunately that hasn't always been the case, but at least Jeroen agreed with me on that point (on some trac ticket). It is especially important for us package maintainers, at least those not directly involved with the upgrade. It is also important for future sage contributors who might otherwise just rather not touch the patch because they don't know why it was introduced.

Although the second point is pretty much moot in this case, since the patch will no longer apply on the next singular version. Still, the first point holds and I think such guildelines work best if they are adhered to unconditionally.

This might of course be due to packaging, I haven't tested it with sage-the-distribution. But the only thing I changed was the singular update.

I'm happy with both versions as long as it's documented. Of course there is value in locality.

I think the patch is re-based. What git facility are you talking about? I usually just redirect `git show` into a file.

Also I'm still getting that one test failure I reported above. Only when running the whole testsuite (not when testing that file individually). I'll see if I can find the root cause of that.

That would avoid having to patch singular. In this case its a bit of a special case since singular already needs special attention anyways, so I'm not very invested.

But since we can't merge this before 8.3 anyways, maybe it'll sort itself out.

I'm arguing mostly on principle: I still think the principle should be to only apply patches very conservatively. If we need a feature or a fix, we should

1) report upstream

2) ask upstream for a release containing that fix/feature

3) if the fix/feature isn't essential, default to waiting for that upstream release. Maybe work around the issue feature within sage until then if possible.

Of course this doesn't 100% apply to this case, since this actually removes patches from singular and the update isn't possible without this. Again, I'm not strongly opposed and mostly arguing on principle.

I see no reason to hurry either.

What are you unsure about? Either you consider #26023 serious enough to warrant unmerging this ticket, or you don't.

Thanks for the notice, and sorry for having taken so long to react.

Unfortunately, I know very, very little about Singular. But I saw that, in `lcm()`, Antonio replaced the call to `singclap_pdivide()` to one to `p_Divide()`. This seems to be a new Singular function that does support polynomials over ℤ. Wouldn't it be possible to use it in `__floordiv__()` too (on a new ticket, of course)?
