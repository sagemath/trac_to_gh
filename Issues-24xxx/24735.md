<a id='comment:4'></a>A patch that makes Sage build with the API changes in 4.1.1 is available at [1]

However, the removal of singclap_pmod and singclap_pdivide for polynomials with integer coefficients [2] causes some regressions:


```
sage: R.<x,y>=ZZ[] 
sage: a=x+y 
sage: b=x-y 
sage: a.gcd(b) 
1 
sage: a.quo_rem(b) 
( 0, x + y ) 
sage: a.gcd(b) 
0 
sage: singular(a).gcd(b) 
1 
```

The tests succeed, including the one over `ZZ`:

```
sage: Pol.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: p = x*y - 5*y^2 + x*z - z^2 + z
sage: q = -3*x^2*y^7*z + 2*x*y^6*z^3 + 2*x^2*y^3*z^4 + x^2*y^5 - 7*x*y^5*z
sage: (21^3*p^2*q).gcd(35^2*p*q^2) == -49*p*q
True
```

<a id='comment:18'></a>There are still many test failures which are unrelated to the sinclap_pdivide issue. They seem caused by singular now returning an warning when computing groebner bases over CC, so Sage falls back to the toy implementation:

```
sage: A.<x,y>=CC[]
sage: I=A.ideal(x-y)
sage: I._groebner_basis_singular()
```
now returns

```
TypeError: Singular error:
// ** groebner base computations with inexact coefficients can not be trusted due to rounding errors
```
With singular 4.1.0 it gives

```
sage: I._groebner_basis_singular()
[x - y]
```

The problem is that the Singular warning
"groebner base computations with inexact coefficients can not be trusted due to rounding errors" matches

```
       if s.find("error") != -1 or s.find("Segment fault") != -1:
```
from singular.py so Sage (incorrectly) throws a SingularError. The test for errors in singular.py should be made more reliable.

No, this is unrelated to the NTL version (I can reproduce both on the Sage distribution with NTL 10.3 and on Arch with NTL 11.2). It is caused by
https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/28d88317

I think the patch is re-based. What git facility are you talking about? I usually just redirect `git show` into a file.

Also I'm still getting that one test failure I reported above. Only when running the whole testsuite (not when testing that file individually). I'll see if I can find the root cause of that.

That would avoid having to patch singular. In this case its a bit of a special case since singular already needs special attention anyways, so I'm not very invested.

But since we can't merge this before 8.3 anyways, maybe it'll sort itself out.

I'm arguing mostly on principle: I still think the principle should be to only apply patches very conservatively. If we need a feature or a fix, we should

1) report upstream

2) ask upstream for a release containing that fix/feature

3) if the fix/feature isn't essential, default to waiting for that upstream release. Maybe work around the issue feature within sage until then if possible.

Of course this doesn't 100% apply to this case, since this actually removes patches from singular and the update isn't possible without this. Again, I'm not strongly opposed and mostly arguing on principle.

Thanks for the notice, and sorry for having taken so long to react.

Unfortunately, I know very, very little about Singular. But I saw that, in `lcm()`, Antonio replaced the call to `singclap_pdivide()` to one to `p_Divide()`. This seems to be a new Singular function that does support polynomials over ℤ. Wouldn't it be possible to use it in `__floordiv__()` too (on a new ticket, of course)?
