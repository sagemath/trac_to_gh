The docs for `random_expr` read:

```
  This function will often raise an error because it tries to create
  an erroneous expression (such as a division by zero).
```
It has the following doctest:

```
        sage: from sage.symbolic.random_tests import *
        sage: set_random_seed(53)
        sage: random_expr(50, nvars=3, coeff_generator=CDF.random_element) # random
        (v1^(0.97134084277 + 0.195868299334*I)/csc(-pi + v1^2 + v3) + sgn(1/
...
```
Despite having a random seed the test run changes with every new builtin function introduced in `sage/functions` because the global function list changes. That's why the test was marked random. The problem however is that the test can even raise an error, as the docs state above. The"`random`" keyword does not catch this, and it would make the test useless anyway. 

Tests are meant to test the functionality of the associated code so the test and perhaps `random_expr` should be rewritten such that it allows a test that does not change with a changed global function list.

 The reason why the doctest fails is that, despite fixing the random seed, the functions and symbols picked by `random_expr` are different. This, at some point in the buildup of the expression, leads to the sub-expression `kronecker_delta(-0.6165326641917295 + 0.15117833554974136*I, e)` which immediately evaluates to `0`. The `0` progresses eventually into a denominator, causing the error. `random_expr` is not written to avoid such errors if they happen, nor does it avoid other exceptions thrown. The author of the doctest apparently just chose a random seed that happens to not throw errors.
 
-Of course the actual bug is that `random_expr` changes behaviour when unrelated code is changed.
+A fix that filters out zero divisions and intended exceptions thrown from code in `functions` before returning the expression would be the  best solution (but it doesn't handle runtime errors from Pynac).
