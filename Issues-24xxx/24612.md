We have

```
sage: S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: G = S4.subgroups()[19]
sage: f = G.coerce_map_from(S4); f
Call morphism:
  From: Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group
  To:   Subgroup of (Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group) generated by [(1,3)(2,4), (1,4,3,2)]
```
This is very wrong, there is no coercion from `S4` to `G`:

```
sage: f(S4[1])
