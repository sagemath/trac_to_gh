sage: type(identity_matrix(ZZ, 2).inverse())
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'>
```

This seems to be counter-intuitive, the result should be an integer matrix again in case that inversion over ZZ is possible.

This really is a feature, not a bug. It is consistent with other uses of inversion in Sage.

What is the feature here? If you work in the matrix space over ZZ, you would not expect - and you would not want - the inverse to be rational, am I wrong?

Imagina that we implement things your way.

Now, suppose that you are inverting many matrices over ZZ which all give a result over QQ (since they are not defined over ZZ). If suddenly one of those inverse matrices happens to be defined over ZZ by accident, then that matrix would have a different parent. That is inconsistent and we really value consistency.

Replying to [galipnik](#comment%3A3):
> If you work in the matrix space over ZZ


...then use the `inverse_of_unit()` method instead of `inverse()`.

This could be reopened as "Mention inverse_of_unit in the documentation of inverse".

The documentation could say something like:

```
The inverse of a ring element is returned as an element in the fraction field.

To get the inverse within the ring, use `:meth:inverse_of_element`::

    sage: m = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2)
    sage: sage_input(m)
    matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    sage: mi = m.inverse()
    sage: sage_input(mi)
    matrix(QQ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    sage: mm = m.inverse_of_unit()
    sage: sage_input(mm)
    matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
```
