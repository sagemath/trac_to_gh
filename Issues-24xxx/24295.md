sage: type(identity_matrix(ZZ, 2).inverse())
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense'>
```

This seems to be counter-intuitive, the result should be an integer matrix again in case that inversion over ZZ is possible.

Imagina that we implement things your way.

Now, suppose that you are inverting many matrices over ZZ which all give a result over QQ (since they are not defined over ZZ). If suddenly one of those inverse matrices happens to be defined over ZZ by accident, then that matrix would have a different parent. That is inconsistent and we really value consistency.

This could be reopened as "Mention inverse_of_unit in the documentation of inverse".

The documentation could say something like:

```
The inverse of a ring element is returned as an element in the fraction field.

To get the inverse within the ring, use `:meth:inverse_of_element`::

    sage: m = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2)
    sage: sage_input(m)
    matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    sage: mi = m.inverse()
    sage: sage_input(mi)
    matrix(QQ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    sage: mm = m.inverse_of_unit()
    sage: sage_input(mm)
    matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
```
