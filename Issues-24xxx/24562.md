Sorry, but I don't understand what "internal details" means. I know we had this discussion before but unless something has changed, virtually all methods should be doctested, e.g., the ones in `_infix_wrapper`. Personally, I have no opinion on whether that's a good or a bad policy (I can see valid arguments on both sides, so I am not sure) but I think it's still the way things work; which could be changed of course.

Btw, with the current state of documentation it is not immediately clear to me what `_infix_wrapper` does. A docstring that explains what this class is doing would be helpful.

If it's unclear, `_infix_wrapper` is just a base class for wrappers around a function turning that function into an infix operator.  `infix_operator` itself is just the decorator, but `_infix_wrapper` is the base for the actual wrapped functions returned by the decorator.  

This was already in the original code under just the name "wrapper", and it was a class defined inline in `infix_operator.__call__`.  I just moved it out to module level because there was no-need to create new instances of that base class for every `infix_operator` call.

I don't agree. Also internal methods should be documented that way wherever possible imo.

When I'm not lazy, I try to do an "indirect doctest" when it's too much code to setup the situation where the method could be used or when the method is cleary just a backing for something else, e.g., I'd test `_add_` with `a+b` even though it that calls `__add__`.
