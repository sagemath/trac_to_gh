Indeed `numerical_approximation` of symbolic expression is lazily converting all arguments to the same parent. Which is very wrong when a function is defined on `R x N`.

Perhaps it would be good to add in `_evalf_` the check

```
if not isinstance(index, numbers.Integral):
    raise ValueError
```

Though I am curious about this sympy misbehavior.

This ticket is about losing precision in expressions that can be FP evaluated because they contain no symbols but may contain functions. While the result precision from the function at hand `complex_root_of` is in principle not affected by the exactness of the index there may be existing/future functions where it is. This can be fixed by not FP converting exact function arguments and letting the function itself (i.e. its `evalf` member) decide what to do with exact arguments. I may well be wrong, and the best solution instead is a type database for function arguments...",

No, that is solving. `N()` just converts symbolic expressions---if they happen to contain symbols you won't get a number, you get an error. `_convert()` helps with that.

This has nothing to do with this ticket. This ticket is about losing precision in expressions that can be FP evaluated because they contain no symbols but may contain functions. While the result precision from the function at hand `complex_root_of` is in principle not affected by the exactness of the index there may be existing/future functions where it is. This can be fixed by not FP converting exact function arguments and letting the function itself (i.e. its `evalf` member) decide what to do with exact arguments. I may well be wrong, and the best solution instead is a type database for function arguments...
