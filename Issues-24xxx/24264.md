It is possible to specify a specific backend like `PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', implementation="singular")` but the opposite (asking for a generic Sage implementation) is not. Fix this by allowing `implementation="generic"`.

This requires various fixes involving the `implementation` keyword being ignored or breaking caching. In particular, we fix this caching bug:

```
sage: p = 2^64 + 13
sage: A = GF(p^2)
sage: B = GF(p^3)
sage: R = A.modulus().parent()
sage: S = B.modulus().parent()
sage: R is S
False
```

We also introduce a new implementation "GF2X" for the GF2X package. This used be called "NTL" which we still allow as alias.

This is harder than expected due to caching. Currently, the caching does not take into account the `implementation` keyword. That is an existing bug, but it makes it pointless to add more support for the `implementation` keyword.

Wouldn't it make sense to fix that?  It doesn't need to use the "implementation" keyword per se, but it would make sense if the type a method was called on was also cached?

I'm likely missing something though since I don't know exactly what you mean in this case by "caching".

What are your thoughts about changing `_implementation_names` to `_implementation`, which only takes a string? It is only used to differentiate between FLINT and NTL implementations in coercion. I think it could simplify the code overall.

Furthermore, how do you feel about instead of storing a key for all implementation keywords possible, we instead standardize the implementation keyword to always give the actual implementation. I know it is a little more brittle, but I think it will make the code more clean and would work well with the above suggestion. I haven't yet fully attempted this, but I will be happy to do this if you do not object.

One thing that definitely needs fixing: By allowing generic coercions, we are introducing a memory leak via cyclic coercion between the generic and FLINT implementations:

```
sage: RF.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='FLINT')
sage: RG.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='generic')
sage: RF.coerce_map_from(RG)
sage: RF.has_coerce_map_from(RG)
True
sage: RG.has_coerce_map_from(RF)
True
```
I've been told that this circular coercion gives a memory leak because the co(?)domain is cached by the coercion model. Although I cannot reproduce it:

```
sage: import gc
sage: for i in range(10000):
....:     if i % 100 == 0:
....:         get_memory_usage()
....:     R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x%s'%i, implementation='FLINT')
....:     S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x%s'%i, implementation='generic')
....:     assert R is not S
....:     assert R.coerce_map_from(S) is not None
....:     assert S.coerce_map_from(R) is not None
....:     del R
....:     del S
....:     _ = gc.collect()
5872.29296875
5872.29296875
5872.29296875
5872.29296875
...
```
However, it does introduce a *very* subtle reason why code could suddenly become slow by multiplying things in the opposite order. We will have to update things accordingly in that spot in `PolynomialRing._coerce_map_from_`.

Well, this will slow down creating polynomial rings. Every time that you create a polynomial ring with `implementation=None` (which is the default, so the most common case), you will need to run some code to figure out the implementation.

Let me give a counter-proposal: instead of making `_implementation_names` an attribute, we create a static method on the polynomial ring class:

```python
# Assuming that the implementation for a given polynomial ring class
# depends only on the base_ring, which is currently the case.
@staticmethod
def _implementation_names(base_ring, implementation):
    # Default implementation for generic polynomial rings
    if implementation is None or implementation == "generic":
        return ["generic", None]
    raise ValueError("unknown implementation {!r}".format(implementation))
```

I think that this will lead to cleaner code without the performance loss of normalizing the `implementation` every time.

It definitely is cleaner to me as well. Some comments:

- This seems fragile:

  ```python
        implementation = self._implementation_names(implementation, base_ring)[0]
        if implementation == "NTL":
  ```
  I would instead do

  ```python
        implementation = self._implementation_names(implementation, base_ring)[0]
        if "NTL" in implementation:
  ```
- The cyclic coercion (comment:22) should get a doctest for only the generic to FLINT (if I am reading the code correctly).
- This feels a bit fragile to me

  ```python
  if self.element_class.__name__ != 'Polynomial_integer_dense_flint':
  ```
  I'm guessing you are doing this to avoid a circular import? What about doing something similar to what is currently there and checking the implementation name?
- Some `_implementation_names_impl` have doctests and others do not (including some with mildly non-trivial behavior).

Can you also explain why you have the `@classmethod` and the `@staticmethod`? I'm not quite sure I understand why we need the redirection.

It was just simpler that way. First of all, the actual implementations can just `return NotImplemented` instead of raising an exception. This also simplifies one check in the polynomial constructor where I'm using list comprehension to check for `NotImplemented`.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment:22):
> One thing that definitely needs fixing: By allowing generic coercions, we are introducing a memory leak via cyclic coercion between the generic and FLINT implementations:

That is a very deep rabbit hole.

First of all, note that cyclic coercion is already possible in other cases:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(3), 't', implementation='FLINT')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(GF(3), 't', implementation='NTL')
sage: R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field of size 3
sage: S
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field of size 3 (using NTL)
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(S)
True
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(R)
True
```

There are two related issues when trying to fix this:

(A) The polynomial ring itself does not store its implementation or any other information which could help to determine in which way a coercion should go.

(B) Pickling doesn't work correctly for non-default implementations:

```
# Continuing the example above
sage: loads(dumps(S)) is S
False
sage: loads(dumps(S)) is R
True
```

Currently, one could fix (A) by not allowing coercions between different implementations. But then (B) gives trouble because then there isn't even a coercion between `loads(dumps(S))` and `S`.

Suggestions??

I either missed, didn't remember, or didn't quite understand the implication of the "The first element in the list is the canonical name." part of the `OUTPUT`. So I thought you were using an undocumented specification.

Would it be possible to have at least one of those tests local to each of these functions? It would make it easier to debug if something broke later on.

I know some people would consider that a bug, and even if is not, it could create strange behavior and slowdowns because of moving between implementations.

It has to store something in order to get the different string representations. As for determining which way to make the coercion is a bit more arbitrary, but something we can do in the `_coerce_map_from_`.

That's a bug (and somewhat horrifying).

> Suggestions??

(B) deserves a ticket all on its own. Although (A) is currently addressed for `ZZ` rings:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't', implementation="FLINT")
sage: S = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't', implementation="NTL")
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(S)
True
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(R)
False
```
I can't think of a simple way with the current framework that we can have an ordering on the implementations that would correspond to the coercion order. I feel like we would need to add another `@staticmethod` specifying this (with a default of `[None]` when there is only 1 implementation, the default).

I am also happy addressing (A) more thoroughly on a followup if we just add a test for

```
sage: T = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 't', implementation="generic")
```
and the non-cyclic coercion with R and S above.

Part of the mess in polynomial rings is that the logic for constructing them is separated in different places:

1. The constructor `PolynomialRing`

2. The `_implementation_names_impl()` method of the polynomial ring.

3. The `__init__` method of the polynomial ring.

There are also two non-equivalent ways to pass an implementation: using the `implementation` keyword or using the `element_class` keyword.

I feel like only `PolynomialRing` should take an `implementation` and not `__init__`. Instead, the `implementation` should be translated somewhere to an `element_class` which is passed to `__init__`.

But that will be for a follow-up.

I "love" when that happens.  I haven't really followed this closely since it quickly went beyond any understanding I have of the coercion system, but I'm glad it will be fixed.

The next thing to do might be to fix cases like the one I pointed out in #24263 to ensure that the polynomial implementation that's supposed to be being tested is actually the one being tested.

Trivial thing, but can we break this output line since it is so long:

```
            ValueError: domain (Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring)
             and codomain (Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring)
             must have the same functorial construction over their base rings
```
Otherwise LGTM and you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Shouldn't the output in doctests match the **actual** output from the terminal? If the actual output is one long line, shouldn't the doctest reflect that?

If you insist, I will change it though.

My usually 90 char wide terminal splits it (essentially randomly) and we have the guideline of 80 char/line in documentation. So with that in mind, I was suggesting the most logical places to split that and keep the lines short. If you would rather leave it as one really (really) long line, then I won't insist, but it makes it much more manageable for me and is in the spirit of the rest of Sage's doc.

In my mind, there is a difference between the different parts of the documentation:

1. **textual documentation**: word wrap as usual

2. **code in EXAMPLES**: follow PEP 8, which means trying to limit the line lengths

3. **output in EXAMPLES**: I think it is best to keep the exact formatting of the output and not randomly wrap lines.
