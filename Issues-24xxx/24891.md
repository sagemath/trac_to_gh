<a id='comment:5'></a>In the documentation, you should avoid multiple statements on a line such as

```
sage: AS = W.domain(); r1 = AS.roots()[4]; print(r1); r2 = AS.roots()[5]; print(r2)
```
It is much more readable as

```
sage: AS = W.domain()
sage: roots = AS.roots()
sage: r1 = roots[4]
sage: r2
(0, 1, 0, -1)
sage: r2 = roots[5]
sage: r2
(0, 0, 1, -1)
```

It would be fine for testing but not for documenting.
