```

The problem is that the Python build system imports `ctypes` at build-time but this will use the *wrong* version of libpython. The build system tried to work around that with

```
# Make sure -L. is placed before -L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib so that python and extension
# modules are linked with the right libpython; we pass this in at make time
# only, since we don't want -L. to be saved as one of the default LDFLAGS
# used for building third-party extension modules
$MAKE LDFLAGS="-L. $LDFLAGS"
```

However, this affects building only, not running. And even using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` won't work since an rpath takes priority over that.
