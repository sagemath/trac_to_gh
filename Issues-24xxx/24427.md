It might still be possible to get GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2. What are the steps to produce

Updating libgap is potentially time-consuming and error-prone. See https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap

Hard to know in advance, but one might hope that minor version bumps
in GAP would be relatively easy to deal with.

The upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 in the ArchLinux packaging of SageMath
seems pretty straightforward:
