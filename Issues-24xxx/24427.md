GAP 4.8.10 was released on 2018-01-15.

Release announcement:

From SageMath 7.6.beta3 to the current SageMath 8.2.beta3,
we use GAP 4.8.6, introduced in #20914. Time to upgrade!

Tarball for GAP:

Note that #22626 will upgrade to the upcoming GAP 4.9,
but it would be nice to upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 for now.

I suggest getting GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2, if it's not too much work, since:

- GAP 4.9 might still be in beta when Sage 8.2 is released.
- GAP 4.9 has major changes, so #22626 (Upgrade to GAP 4.9) might take time.

Although the release of GAP 4.9.1 is approaching, I don't know if it will still be a beta

It might still be possible to get GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2. What are the steps to produce

Hard to know in advance, but one might hope that minor version bumps
in GAP would be relatively easy to deal with.

The upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 in the ArchLinux packaging of SageMath
seems pretty straightforward:

To get the ball rolling, I updated the GAP sources according to the instructions in the SPKG.
I haven't run the tests yet (rebuilding my Sage).

We should note that the only thing changing since 4.8.8 is the packages distributed with gap.

Core gap code and databases have not changed since 4.8.8. The libgap for 4.8.8 that debian made should be identical for 4.8.10.

Thanks François for the info.

The branch as is is not yet functional, as libgap needs to be the same version as gap.
Sebastian's libgap above is missing the prefixing; he will work on this tonight, and then I'll update this branch and rerun the tests.
