I suggest getting GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2, if it's not too much work, since:

- GAP 4.9 might still be in beta when Sage 8.2 is released.
- GAP 4.9 has major changes, so #22626 (Upgrade to GAP 4.9) might take time.

Although the release of GAP 4.9.1 is approaching, I don't know if it will still be a beta
or considered the official 4.9 release.

It might still be possible to get GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2. What are the steps to produce
tarballs for database_gap, gap_packages, libgap?

Updating libgap is potentially time-consuming and error-prone. See https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap

Hard to know in advance, but one might hope that minor version bumps
in GAP would be relatively easy to deal with.

The upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 in the ArchLinux packaging of SageMath
seems pretty straightforward:

To get the ball rolling, I updated the GAP sources according to the instructions in the SPKG.
I haven't run the tests yet (rebuilding my Sage).

Core gap code and databases have not changed since 4.8.8. The libgap for 4.8.8 that debian made should be identical for 4.8.10.

Thanks François for the info.

The branch as is is not yet functional, as libgap needs to be the same version as gap.
Sebastian's libgap above is missing the prefixing; he will work on this tonight, and then I'll update this branch and rerun the tests.
