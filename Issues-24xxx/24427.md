Updating libgap is potentially time-consuming and error-prone. See https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap

Hard to know in advance, but one might hope that minor version bumps
in GAP would be relatively easy to deal with.

The upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 in the ArchLinux packaging of SageMath
seems pretty straightforward:

The branch as is is not yet functional, as libgap needs to be the same version as gap.
Sebastian's libgap above is missing the prefixing; he will work on this tonight, and then I'll update this branch and rerun the tests.
