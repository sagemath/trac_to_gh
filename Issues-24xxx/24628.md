The JIT feature of PCRE is buggy on some systems: it already required a fix for Cygwin and it gives a "bus error" on Solaris.

To work around this, I propose to *always* run the PCRE testsuite. This takes only a few seconds anyway. If the testsuite fails, recompile PCRE without `--enable-jit`.

(Skip this, at the very least, on Cygwin since the testsuite fails there anyways, albeit for unrelated reasons; see #24756).

Slower but functional should be acceptable. Note that my patch still uses JIT on systems where it is supported.

IMHO on Cygwin, and, in fact on any system that provides PCRE,
we should just use the system's one.

Agreed. Working on that :)

This is a **general** need : unless we have specific needs not solvable in an interface, we should use whatever is installed systemwide.

A mechanism to do that in the toplevel configuration file would be useful. IIRC, Erik has undertaken to refactor parts of this cofiguraion system (that's why I haven't yet progresed much on OpenSSL, BTW : I'm waiting for the dust to settle a bit...), this might be one of his objectives.

However, I can think of difficulties to extende such a mechanism to *library* interfaces...

I already have a prototype for this that I'm pretty happy with, but I've been waiting, as you say, for the dust to settle on #21524 before moving forward on it.  That ticket is ready for review BTW.
