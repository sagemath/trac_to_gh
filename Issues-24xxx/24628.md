The JIT feature of PCRE is buggy on some systems: it already required a fix for Cygwin and it gives a "bus error" on Solaris.

To work around this, I propose to *always* run the PCRE testsuite. This takes only a few seconds anyway. If the testsuite fails, recompile PCRE without `--enable-jit`.

(Skip this, at the very least, on Cygwin since the testsuite fails there anyways, albeit for unrelated reasons; see #24756).

This is a **general** need : unless we have specific needs not solvable in an interface, we should use whatever is installed systemwide.

A mechanism to do that in the toplevel configuration file would be useful. IIRC, Erik has undertaken to refactor parts of this cofiguraion system (that's why I haven't yet progresed much on OpenSSL, BTW : I'm waiting for the dust to settle a bit...), this might be one of his objectives.

However, I can think of difficulties to extende such a mechanism to //library// interfaces...

 The JIT feature of PCRE is buggy on some systems: it already required a fix for Cygwin and it gives a "bus error" on Solaris.
 
 To work around this, I propose to *always* run the PCRE testsuite. This takes only a few seconds anyway. If the testsuite fails, recompile PCRE without `--enable-jit`.
