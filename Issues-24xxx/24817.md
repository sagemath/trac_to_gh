Before:

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_arb import ComplexBall
sage: %timeit ComplexBall(CBF, 1)
The slowest run took 65.49 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 444 ns per loop
sage: %timeit CBF(1)
The slowest run took 119.18 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 604 ns per loop
sage: %timeit CBF(1, 2)
The slowest run took 58.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.75 Âµs per loop
```
After:

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_arb import ComplexBall
sage: %timeit ComplexBall(CBF, 1)
The slowest run took 58.67 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 459 ns per loop
sage: %timeit CBF(1)
The slowest run took 135.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 642 ns per loop
sage: %timeit CBF(1, 2)
The slowest run took 18.88 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 909 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ComplexBall(CBF, 1, 2)
The slowest run took 18.09 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 620 ns per loop
```
