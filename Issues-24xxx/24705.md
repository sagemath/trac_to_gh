sagelib is the culprit. It has libstdc++ hardcoded:

At the moment we're still experimenting with flags, see #24707#comment:9. But I already think that the line above needs to be changed to `libs = libs + ['c++']` in order to get `-lc++` in the link command.

Do you claim that this is enough to override what is written in setup.py???

Recall that Sage's setup.py forces usage of `libstdc++` and not `libc++`.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Hooray, it builds now! I didn't run tests though. Anyway, to summarize what I did on ubuntu:

- install clang, clang-dev, libc++abi-dev
- checkout/merge #24710 and #24696
- 
  {{{
export CC="clang"
export CXX="clang++"
export CLANG_DEFAULT_CXX_STDLIB="libc++"
  }}}
- make

So, your finding out about `CLANG_DEFAULT_CXX_STDLIB` was great!

Side-remarks:

- I did not have the impression that building Sage with clang was faster than with gcc.
- I will now do some small timings to see about the performance of the code generated by clang vs. gcc.

<a id='comment:29'></a>I just realise that using #24710 was supposed to be not needed (it was closed as invalid).

Anyway, a data point concerning timings, after installing meataxe:
- With gcc
  {{{
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: N = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
sage: %timeit _=M-N
10 loops, best of 3: 20.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _=M*N
1 loop, best of 3: 46.5 s per loop
  }}}
- With clang:
  {{{
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: N = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
sage: %timeit _=M-N
10 loops, best of 3: 20.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _=M*N
1 loop, best of 3: 53.2 s per loop
  }}}

Since meataxe is heavily used in the computations that I *really* care about (group cohomology), I am not so happy about a slow-down of almost 15%. So, probably I won't use clang in my computations. Nonetheless, it is good for portability that clang can also be used on ubuntu.
