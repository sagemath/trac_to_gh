sagelib is the culprit. It has libstdc++ hardcoded:

This is the relevant part of `src/setup.py`:

```
        # Libraries: add stdc++ if needed and sort them
        libs = kwds.get('libraries', [])
        if cplusplus:
            libs = libs + ['stdc++']

It seems best to add `"--stdlib=libc++"`(else the libstdc++ is linked) only if it is already in CFLAGS. See also #24705. 

Testing this manually works, except for `element_givaro.pyx` which still gets compiled without the `"--stdlib=libc++"` directive.

Sorry, I don't get it: What would you replace it with, so that the sage library will not use `libstdc++` if `--stdlib=libc++` is provided?

At the moment we're still experimenting with flags, see [#24707 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24707#comment:9). But I already think that the line above needs to be changed to `libs = libs + ['c++']` in order to get `-lc++` in the link command.

OK, trying again with #24710 and #24696

Hooray, it builds now! I didn't run tests though. Anyway, to summarize what I did on ubuntu:

- install clang, clang-dev, libc++abi-dev
- checkout/merge #24710 and #24696
- 

  ```
  export CC="clang"
  export CXX="clang++"
  export CLANG_DEFAULT_CXX_STDLIB="libc++"
  ```
- make

So, your finding out about `CLANG_DEFAULT_CXX_STDLIB` was great!

Side-remarks:

- I did not have the impression that building Sage with clang was faster than with gcc.
- I will now do some small timings to see about the performance of the code generated by clang vs. gcc.

I just realise that using #24710 was supposed to be not needed (it was closed as invalid).

Anyway, a data point concerning timings, after installing meataxe:
- With gcc

  ```
  sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
  sage: type(M)
  <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
  sage: N = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
  sage: %timeit _=M-N
  10 loops, best of 3: 20.5 ms per loop
  sage: %timeit _=M*N
  1 loop, best of 3: 46.5 s per loop
  ```
- With clang:

  ```
  sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
  sage: type(M)
  <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
  sage: N = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5000)
  sage: %timeit _=M-N
  10 loops, best of 3: 20.5 ms per loop
  sage: %timeit _=M*N
  1 loop, best of 3: 53.2 s per loop
  ```

Since meataxe is heavily used in the computations that I *really* care about (group cohomology), I am not so happy about a slow-down of almost 15%. So, probably I won't use clang in my computations. Nonetheless, it is good for portability that clang can also be used on ubuntu.

I think so. Certainly the test failure should be for a different ticket.
