<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

There is a general pattern here:

In Cython code in Sage, when checking for an `int`-like object, this is often done like

```
if isinstance(x, int):
    # Handle int
elif isinstance(x, long):
    # Handle long
```

This works fine in Python 2 because `int` and `long` are distinct types. In Python 3, there is only one type, which is the `long` type from Python 2 but which is called `int` in Python 3 (similar to how the `unicode` type from Python 2 is called `str` in Python 3).

Now Cython understands the name `long` to refer to the type which is called `long` in Python 2 and `int` in Python 3. It also understands `int` to refer to the type which is called `int` in Python 2 and the *different* type which is called `int` in Python 3.

So, in Cython code for Python 3, the checks `isinstance(x, int)` and `isinstance(x, long)` are equivalent. However, the code which needs to be executed is the code for the `long` type, so we should do that check first.
