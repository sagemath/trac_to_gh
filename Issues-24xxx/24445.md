With the optional meataxe package installed, I get

```
sage: K.<a>=FiniteField(3^2)
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(K, 2, 5, implementation="generic")
sage: type(MS.random_element())
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```
which is good, but

```
sage: type(random_matrix(K, 2, 5, implementation="generic"))
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
```
which is bad.

So, the `random_matrix` constructor should take into account what was contributed in #23706.

```
The default implementation of :meth:`~sage.matrix.matrix2.randomize` relies
on the ``random_element()`` method for the base ring.  The ``density`` and
``sparse`` keywords behave as described above. Since we have a different
randomisation when using the optional meataxe package, we have to make sure
that we use the default implementation in this test::

    sage: K.<a>=FiniteField(3^2)
    sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense import Matrix_generic_dense
    sage: MS = MatrixSpace(K, 2, 5)
    sage: MS._MatrixSpace__matrix_class = Matrix_generic_dense
    sage: random_matrix(K, 2, 5)
    [      1       a       1 2*a + 1       2]
    [    2*a   a + 2       0       2       1]
```
It could now be much simpler without any special hack.
