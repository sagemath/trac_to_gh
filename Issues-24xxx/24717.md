Yes, and there are several other methods that could implement `analytic=True`--but I thought it would be better to have some easy ones now rather than all later. (Though, thinking of it, pow wouldn't be that hard to support.)

Either I don't understand what you mean, or there are already one or two such examples.

Indeed, but pow is perhaps the most important of them all...

Yes, but it is also a bit harder to implement due to the need to share code with the `__pow__`, which participates in the coercion system... but ok, I'll try to see what I can do.

If you implement `__pow__`, you bypass the coercion system altogether (similar to if you implement `__mul__`). ADDENDUM - Unless of course you call the coercion framework yourself.

Can you explain the difference? I thought `Integer.__new__(Integer)` had been working already for a long time, and

```
$ git grep 'Integer.__new__' | wc -l
95
```

On the other hand, this is the current `PY_NEW` documentation

```
    Return ``t.__new__(t)``.  This works even for types like
    :class:`Integer` where we change ``tp_new`` at runtime (Cython
    optimizations assume that ``tp_new`` doesn't change).
```

Oups.

Ok. This has nothing to do with this ticket (I'm just changing `s.r.i.Integer` to `Integer` in an existing call), but let's be safe.
