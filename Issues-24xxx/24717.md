If you implement `__pow__`, you bypass the coercion system altogether (similar to if you implement `__mul__`). ADDENDUM - Unless of course you call the coercion framework yourself.

On the other hand, this is the current `PY_NEW` documentation

```
    Return ``t.__new__(t)``.  This works even for types like
    :class:`Integer` where we change ``tp_new`` at runtime (Cython
    optimizations assume that ``tp_new`` doesn't change).
