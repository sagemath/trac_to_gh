* The Foata-Sch√ºtzenberger transform on permutations is implemented (foata_bijection), but its inverse is not. This should be easy to fix -- an algorithm is given in the very same reference http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1978-3MajorIndexMathNachr.pdf .

* The first fundamental bijection on S_n, as well as its inverse, seem to not be in [SageMath](SageMath) (although FindStat has them: http://www.findstat.org/MapsDatabase/Mp00087 ). A similarly defined map -- forget_cycles -- already exists, but this is not it.

<a id='comment:4'></a>It looks good overall. However, I do have some comments:

- In `to_cycles()`, `mins` does not make grammatical sense to me (I know you are avoiding `min`). How about `use_min`?

- Wrong type of tick at the end ``\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}'`.
- I would change
  {{{#!diff

-        inverse, see :meth:`fundamental_transformation_inverse`.
+        .. SEEALSO::

+            :meth:`fundamental_transformation_inverse` for the inverse map.
  }}}
  and similar for the inverse map.
- You say in the ticket description that the `fundamental_transform` is different than `forget_cycles`. You should document this clearly in both of these methods, including an example where they differ.
- The line with the `== P` bugs me:
  {{{#!sage
            sage: all( P.fundamental_transformation_inverse().fundamental_transformation()
            ....:      == P
            ....:      for P in Permutations(4))
  }}}
  I would break the 80 char/line here, but that is bikeshedding. Feel free to ignore.
- I think the border cases and systematic check should be in a `TESTS::` block. Also, I would add a inverse then normal check as well.
