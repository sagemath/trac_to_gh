Implement a fast variant of `pyobject_to_long`, which could be used to replace checks of the form `isinstance(x, int)`.

The goal of these functions is to provide a single place to check for integers and convert them to a C `long` (at least in Cython code, where performance matters most). Various places in Sage check for integers in different ways. First of all, this is an inconsistency which should be fixed.

In Python 3, the types `int`/`long` are changed, so many of the existing checks will need to be changed anyway. So we might as well provide one function which should be able to replace most of these checks. And ideally, we want to do this without losing too much performance. For that reason, I avoid `PyLong_FromLong` in favour of a hand-written implementation.

The function `pyobject_to_long` has signature

```
cdef bint integer_check_long(x, long* value, int* err)
```
It does several things: first of all, it checks whether `x` is "integer-like". This means that it is either a Python `int` or `long`, a Sage `Integer` or it supports `__index__`. The return value of the function is whether or not it is an integer. If it is an integer, it tries to convert the value to a C `long` and stores it in `*value`. Errors are passed through the `*err` variable.

This interface looks overcomplicated on first sight, but the complexity is needed to support the various use cases of this function. Also note that it is an `inline` function, so the compiler should be able to optimize away the unused variables.

Use case 1: a function can take different kinds of input and want to check whether the input is an integer. Typically, this would be done with a long `if` chain like

```
if isinstance(x, ...):
    ...
elif isinstance(x, ...):
    ...
elif integer_check_long(x, &value, &err):
    # Process value and err as needed
elif isinstance(x, ...):
    ...
```

Use case 2: convert an integer to a C `long` purely for performance. In this case, you want to treat overflow the same as the input not being an integer:

```
cdef int err = -1
integer_check_long(x, &value, &err)
if err == 0:
    # Conversion successful, use value
```

Depends on #24252

I think it would be better if `integer_check_long` and `integer_check_long_py` returned the error and `0` if it was completely successful.

Also, in #24248, you do not even use the return `bint` of `integer_check_long_py`.

+Implement a fast variant of `pyobject_to_long`, which could be used to replace checks of the form `isinstance(x, int)`.
+
+The goal of these functions is to provide a single place to check for integers and convert them to a C `long` (at least in Cython code, where performance matters most). Various places in Sage check for integers in different ways. First of all, this is an inconsistency which should be fixed.

+In Python 3, the types `int`/`long` are changed, so many of the existing checks will need to be changed anyway. So we might as well provide one function which should be able to replace most of these checks. And ideally, we want to do this without losing too much performance. For that reason, I avoid `PyLong_FromLong` in favour of a hand-written implementation.
+
+The function `pyobject_to_long` has signature
+
+```
+cdef bint integer_check_long(x, long* value, int* err)
+```
+It does several things: first of all, it checks whether `x` is "integer-like". This means that it is either a Python `int` or `long`, a Sage `Integer` or it supports `__index__`. The return value of the function is whether or not it is an integer. If it is an integer, it tries to convert the value to a C `long` and stores it in `*value`.

Do you have a place on a future ticket where use case 1 applies? I see use case 2 on #24247 and this one:

```python
            if integer_check_long_py(right, &value, &err):
                if not err:
                    return (<Element>left)._pow_long(value)
                else:
                    return (<Element>left)._pow_int(right)
```
which could be simplified to

```python
            err = integer_check_long_py(right, &value):
            if not err:
                return (<Element>left)._pow_long(value)
            elif err == ERR_OVERFLOW:
                return (<Element>left)._pow_int(right)
```

However, if you see a clear benefit to take on the more complicated function description and return values, then you can set this to a positive review. I just am thinking a little bit about the potential future maintenance of this function (I also don't think there will be any [noticeable] performance difference) and the places where it is used.

Fun observation: compiler warnings can be used to get data on how the compiler is able to optimize the code. For example, in #24247 I'm writing essentially

```
        cdef long value
        cdef int err
        if integer_check_long(y, &value, &err):
            if not err:
                return (<Element>x)._pow_long(value)
```
In this case, the compiler *does not give a warning* that `err` and `value` might be uninitialized. This means that the compiler is able to inline and optimize all code paths of `integer_check_long` to prove that `err` and `value` are set to a known value whenever they are accessed in the code snippet above.

> As for "integer_fake" is there maybe a name for it that better reflects its purpose"?  I was thinking something like "integer_proto" (for prototype) since providing early access to the Integer prototype seems to be its primary purpose for existing.

I think that `integer_fake` or `integer_proto` are equally meaningless. What would "prototype" mean in this context? I don't mind changing the name, but I'm not convinced with `integer_proto` either.

> "integer_fake" to me sounds like something for testing, or some other odd purpose.

"odd purpose" totally applies here :-)

It's a fake forward declaration which shouldn't be used.
