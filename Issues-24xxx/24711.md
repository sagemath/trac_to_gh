Simplicial complexes have a `remove_face` method for removing a single face.

It might be worth having a `remove_faces` method for removing several faces at once.

See sage-devel discussion:
- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Uwx1X3sNAmw/discussion

This ticket also adds a boolean parameter `check` which when `True` causes these methods to throw a `ValueError` if the face to be removed does not exist.

The default behavior is irrelevant. I am questioning the divergence from `add_face` (and `add/remove_edge` from graphs). It also does impose an extra (albeit very small) maintenance burden that is worth taking a moment to consider.

In my opinion, the convenience of having a parameter to easily "safety-check" a construction outweighs the minor burden introduced (particularly since the function never returns any output). However, for the purposes of keeping the behavior uniform, perhaps implementing the check (in all related functions) should be moved to another ticket.
