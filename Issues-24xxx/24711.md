Simplicial complexes have a `remove_face` method for removing a single face.

It might be worth having a `remove_faces` method for removing several faces at once.

See sage-devel discussion:
- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Uwx1X3sNAmw/discussion

This ticket also adds a boolean parameter `check` which when `True` causes these methods to throw a `ValueError` if the face to be removed does not exist.

The default behavior is irrelevant. I am questioning the divergence from `add_face` (and `add/remove_edge` from graphs). It also does impose an extra (albeit very small) maintenance burden that is worth taking a moment to consider.

The reason I added a `check` feature to the existing function `remove_face` comes from the original discussion on `sage-devel`, mentioned in the ticket description. If someone uses `K.remove_face([list of faces])`, as they attempted before posting with their question, it fails silently because `[list of faces]` is not a face in `K`. Adding this argument at least gives users the opportunity to do some simple debugging.
