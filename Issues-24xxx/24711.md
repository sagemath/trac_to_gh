```
Simplicial complexes have a `remove_face` method for removing a single face.

It might be worth having a `remove_faces` method for removing several faces at once.

See sage-devel discussion:
- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Uwx1X3sNAmw/discussion

This ticket also adds a boolean parameter `check` which when `True` causes these methods to throw a `ValueError` if the face to be removed does not exist.

Depends on #25574

I tried writing `remove_faces` from scratch, but it turned out to be faster to just call the existing `remove_face` over and over again. At least, when removing faces of low codimension, it was about 5 times faster to call `remove_face` repeatedly. When removing faces of high codimension, my other version was a little faster, taking about 2/3 the time. Since the old version was much faster some of the time and a just little slower some of the time, I kept it.

The default behavior is irrelevant. I am questioning the divergence from `add_face` (and `add/remove_edge` from graphs). It also does impose an extra (albeit very small) maintenance burden that is worth taking a moment to consider.
