From https://www.csun.edu/~ctoth/Handbook/chap15.pdf:

Stacking onto a face of a polytope adds a vertex slightly outside of the polytope positioned over a point in the interior of the face.

This is the "polar" of the truncation operation.

Here's a first working version.

I hesitated between different approaches. This is not the most flexible implementation, but at least a solid enough implementation.

That's a nice addition. 

One question: Should we give the user more control over the base ring of the resulting stacked polytope? At the moment it quietly changes base ring:

```
sage: C  = polytopes.cube()
sage: C.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: C.stack(C.faces(2)[2], 1/2).base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: C.stack(C.faces(2)[2], 0.5).base_ring()
Real Double Field
```


Also, in the dual method of face-truncation, there is an option  `linear_coefficients=None`. Should there be an analogous option here?

I do not think it is a good idea. The above is consistent with the `Polyhedron` constructor and also the current behavior for scaling (and many other methods...):

```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: 1/2*C
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices
sage: 0.5*C
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices
```

The user should be aware of the type of inputs that are given, and the constructed object is somehow expected to be in the fraction field of the ring. The base_ring of `self` can not be kept in general and if the user wants to keep the base ring, it should keep the input to be in the base ring...

I agree that it would be nice to make this step for the user, but it is a nightmare to implement in a uniform stable way... :-/

I thought about it, but it leads to a lot of case analysis. At least, I did not find a simple way to do this. it seems to me that the dual equivalent has more "accessible" freedom than that one. Although I may be wrong.

ok, I agree with your reasoning above. 

One more thing:

The stacking seems to work nicely for unbounded polyhedra if you stack on bounded faces of them:

```
sage: [fac] =  [_ for _ in P.faces(1) if _.as_polyhedron().is_compact()]
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs = [[-1,1,0], [1,0,-1], [1,0,1]])
sage: [fac] =  [_ for _ in P.faces(1) if _.as_polyhedron().is_compact()]
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs = [[-1,1,0], [1,0,-1], [1,0,1]]); P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray
sage: [fac] =  [_ for _ in P.faces(1) if _.as_polyhedron().is_compact()]
sage: SP = P.stack(fac); SP
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices and 1 ray
sage: P.vertices(), SP.vertices()
((A vertex at (1, 1), A vertex at (1, -1)),
 (A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (1, -1), A vertex at (1, 1)))
```
Could you add this as an example?

What is the desired behavior when stacking on unbounded faces of unbounded polyhedra?

Could you retrieve the first `P` above? It seems to be missing.

Sure!

If one takes "stacking" as adding a vertex "just outside" a face as a definition, then it is not very difficult to extend it to unbounded faces using `.representative_point()` for `face.as_polyhedron()` and pushing it out a little.
