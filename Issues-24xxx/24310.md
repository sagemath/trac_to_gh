**Attachment:** [crash_xpy5Sy.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket24310/crash_xpy5Sy.log)

Works for me:

```
sage: %timeit 1+1
The slowest run took 24.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 204 ns per loop
```

Obvious question: did you run `make` (or at least `make build`)?

Details:
- with `export SAGE_DEBUG=no ; ./sage -p python2 ; make start`: timeit does not crash
- with `export SAGE_DEBUG=yes ; ./sage -p python2 ; export SAGE_DEBUG=no ; make start`: timeit does crash
- with `export SAGE_DEBUG=no ; ./sage -p python2 ; make start`: timeit does not crash

I also found this:
https://bugs.python.org/issue21385

If this is the same bug then they fixed it in Py3 but apparently not in Py2.
