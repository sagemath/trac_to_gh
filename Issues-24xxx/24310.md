Attachment: **[crash_xpy5Sy.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket24310/crash_xpy5Sy.log)**

Works for me:

```
sage: %timeit 1+1
The slowest run took 24.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 204 ns per loop
```

Obvious question: did you run `make` (or at least `make build`)?
