I fixed a number of these already in my own branch but differently--in most of these cases instead of `list(map(...))` I think it makes just as much sense to rewrite them as a list comprehension.

For example instead of

```
self._aspect_ratio = list(map(float, v))
```

write

```
self._aspect_ratio = [float(x) for x in v]
```

Personally I find this more readable, but that's subjective.  More importantly it's just as efficient if not moreso, and avoids the unnecessary list copying on Python 2.
