I have now moved the code to graph.py; it really doesn't make to much sense for digraphs. 
Also I opened  ticket:24648 to move some more functions.

The ticket for the faster 3-vertex-connectivity test is here: ticket:24635. (I hope it is not a duplicate; can I find the list of the GSoC application somewhere?)
