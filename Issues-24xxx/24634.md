Keywords: polyhedron, polytopes, graphs, planar

A graph is polyhedral if it is simple, 3-connected and planar.

This will be useful to have for ticket:24636 and ticket:24637.

Is the proposed method (and definition) valid for both graphs and digraphs ?
If not, it must be moved to graph.py (we should do the same for other methods).

Thank you jmantysalo and dcoudert! I didn't want to use `_scream_if_not_simple`, because I think it is actually better to return `False` in this case.

I have now moved the code to graph.py; it really doesn't make to much sense for digraphs. 
Also I opened  ticket:24648 to move some more functions.

The ticket for the faster 3-vertex-connectivity test is here: ticket:24635. (I hope it is not a duplicate; can I find the list of the GSoC application somewhere?)
