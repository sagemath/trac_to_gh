This is an implementation of algorithm 3.4.1 from Markus Kirschmer's "Definite quadratic and hermitian forms with small class number."  Given a non-square b and a set of primes S, the function returns a number a which has negative Hilbert symbol with respect to b at precisely the primes in S.  

This is a function in service to algorithm 3.4.3, `quadratic_form_form_local_invariants()`, ticket #24108.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

So here are some thoughts:

This is just a helper function so it should not pollute the global namespace.
Is there a reason that you have implemented Markus algorithm just for `QQ`?
The beauty of Markus' work is that he did it directly for number fields.
It should not be too hard to do it for number fields.
All the necessary functions like class groups, ideals, hilbert symbols, places, are there:

```
sage: K.<a>=CyclotomicField(13)
sage: P=K.primes_above(3)[0]
sage: P
Fractional ideal (3, a^3 - a - 1)
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(3,1+a,P)
1
```
We can define the function as a method of the number field. Just like the hilbert_symbol.
Maybe the name S_hilbert_symbol is misleading? I would expect it to be the global hilbert_symbol of the localization at S or something like that. This function seems more like an inverse image?
maybe hilbert_symbol_inv_S?

Some remarks for formatting:
Comments should be of the form (note the space)

```
# foo does bla
foo = 3 
```
See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments.

You are redefining V,W,vv in the while loop.
But really they stay constant. So they should not sit in the loop.

Use the names of Markus if possible or more descriptive names.
HH,PP etc. is not very descriptive. Same for i,j.
I do not see the need to define H. Why hide everything in lists?

Either use the verbose things or remove them.

I'm not sure about that name, it already exists and means something else.  I am happy with S_hilbert_symbol since it's restricting the Hilbert symbol at a finite set of primes, it's pretty consistent with your initial interpretation in comment 9; a hilbert symbol taken at a finite number of localizations.

Eventually we can split this into two methods, one for QQ an one for number fields.  I've got the general number fields method queued up and ready to go as soon as tickets #25023 and #25029 are positively reviewed.

Mhh I do not like the prefix S_. In methods like S_unit_group and S_class_group, the primes in S are inverted. But we are not inverting anything - we are working in fields anyways. So there is no relation to this kind of objects? Finally in these S-rings one can define a hilbert symbol and we are not computing it.

For `b` and `S` given our function computes `a` such that `hilbert_conductor(a,b) = prod(S)` plus a condition at infinity. So I think that it is pretty close. And I like the idea that if you type
`hilbert` + autocompletion you get this method suggested. 
So maybe 

- `hilbert_something`
- `hilbert_conductor_something`
- `hilbert_conductor_inverse` with optional argument `b`?
- `hilbert_conductor_inverse_S`?

ooops I have the numberfield version ready as well
