#23955 fixed a bug and introduced a new one instead :-(.

```
sage: from sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus import Genus
sage: A = matrix.diagonal([2,6,8])
sage: Genus(A)
Genus of
[2 0 0]
[0 6 0]
[0 0 8]
Genus symbol at 2:    [2^-2]_1 :[8^1]_1
Genus symbol at 3:     1^2 3^-1
```
The colon indicates that we have two trains here. But really there is only one. So there should be no colon. The bug is in the canonical_2_adic_trains() method.
