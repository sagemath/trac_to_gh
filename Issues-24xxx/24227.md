I could be missing some subtlety here but why would you do "this" for `x`?  This is in `Integer.__mod__` so `x` would never be a `long`.

This is a difference between the Python language and the C API.

Python has `__mod__` and `__rmod__`, the C API has `tp_as_number->nb_remainder` where it's not guaranteed that the first argument is of the expected type.

Cython interfaces the C API but with a syntax similar to Python. Most of time, this is useful, but it does cause some confusion. This is probably also the reason why the arguments are called `(x, y)` instead of `(self, other)`.
