Since 8.2.beta8, the `$(SAGERUNTIME)` dependency in `build/make/Makefile` does not work correctly. For example, after installing `sagetex` (which should install `$(SAGERUNTIME)`):

```
[sagetex-3.0] Successfully installed sagetex-3.0

[sagetex-3.0] /home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/var/tmp/sage/build/sagetex-3.0

************************************************************************
It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.

I just discovered `$(SAGERUNTIME)` recently myself, while looking into some other issue.  I think it's just defined a little too late in the Makefile now.
