In a few places, there is `raise NotImplemented` which is obviously wrong. This affects the following files:

```
src/sage/combinat/designs/ext_rep.py
src/sage/combinat/matrices/latin.py (2 times)
src/sage/stats/hmm/distributions.pyx
```

These should be replaced by raising a proper exception.

Also the documentation at the start of `src/sage/groups/libgap_mixin.py` should be changed too, to `NotImplementedError` I guess.
