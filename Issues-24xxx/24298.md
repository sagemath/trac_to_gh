What do you think about just having:

```python
def is_identity(self):
   return self._richcmp_(self._parent.identity(), Py_EQ)
```
and letting the parent handle the verification of being an endomorphism ring? IMO, this is more future-proof if we end up having a subclass `Endset` of `Homset`, where we could avoid the check. We might also want to cache the result of `identity` so we don't have to recreate a (simple) identity map on every call.

Otherwise LGTM.

That would be slightly less efficient because of the extra level of indirection. But you are right in principle.

I think so. Calling `is_identity()` is pretty meaningless on a non-Endset so I hope that it doesn't happen often in serious code.
