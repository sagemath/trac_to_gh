<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
A Cartan matrix is a (subclass of) Cartan type, so I am not sure this should be considered a bug but a feature. If you want the specific type data of the Cartan matrix, you can definitely use

```
sage: CartanMatrix([[2]]).cartan_type()
['A', 1]
```

My understanding of the rationale behind doing things this way is that a Dynkin diagram, Cartan matrix, and the Cartan type data are all equivalent information and the Cartan type is suppose to be the generic information. Although this is somewhat confusing and a bit inconsistent, so there is probable cause to change it.

Nicolas, any thoughts?
