<a id='comment:6'></a>As the main code now handles special cases too, you can remove

```
if not self: # empty graph                                              
    return [],[]

if len(self) == 1: # only one vertex                                    
    return [self.vertices()],[]
```

It seems strange to say

```
try:
    # We consider the next of its neighbors                     
    w = next(neighbors[v])
      . . .
# We went through all of v's neighbors                          
except StopIteration:
 . . .
```

as you could just use

```
for w in neighbors[v]:
   . . .
. . .
```

Otherwise I did not yet read the code.

Good. This addition actually made parts of Sage simpler.

Yeah, that was my bad.

I did a technical merge and will check this one.
