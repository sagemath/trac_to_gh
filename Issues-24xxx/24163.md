As the main code now handles special cases too, you can remove

```
if not self: # empty graph                                              
    return [],[]

if len(self) == 1: # only one vertex                                    
    return [self.vertices()],[]
```

It seems strange to say

```
try:
    # We consider the next of its neighbors                     
    w = next(neighbors[v])
      . . .
# We went through all of v's neighbors                          
except StopIteration:
 . . .
```

as you could just use

```
for w in neighbors[v]:
   . . .
. . .
```

Otherwise I did not yet read the code.

I have removed the special cases.

The try/except is needed here. The original algorithm do recursive calls. To avoid that, we use stack, plus we use an array (dictionary) of iterators over the neighbors to do the for loop.

Good. This addition actually made parts of Sage simpler.

Yeah, that was my bad.

I did a technical merge and will check this one.
