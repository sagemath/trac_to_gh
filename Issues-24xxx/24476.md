#12426 introduces a new package "gfortran" which reuses the gcc tarball. This is done by symlinking various files in `build/pkgs/gfortran` to `build/pkgs/gcc`. This confuses the tarball downloader, so we add support for such symlinks in `sage_bootstrap`.

Looking up tarball name -> package name isn't really important I think. Could just return a set of matching packages.

It is needed because the tarballs on the server are stored per package. The URL is something like `.../spkg/upstream/gcc/gcc-7.2.0.xz`, where `gcc` is the package name.
