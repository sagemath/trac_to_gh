#12426 introduces a new package "gfortran" which reuses the gcc tarball. This is done by symlinking various files in `build/pkgs/gfortran` to `build/pkgs/gcc`. This confuses the tarball downloader, so we add support for such symlinks in `sage_bootstrap`.

So whats the plan, have a symlinked tarball or two packages refer to the same tarball? The latter seems more sane to me. Whereas the former raises some questions, e.g. what to upload to mirrors. 

Looking up tarball name -> package name isn't really important I think. Could just return a set of matching packages.

Two packages referring to the same tarball. In #12426 I ended up creating a spkg for gfortran which of course uses gcc's tarball.

It is needed because the tarballs on the server are stored per package. The URL is something like `.../spkg/upstream/gcc/gcc-7.2.0.xz`, where `gcc` is the package name.
