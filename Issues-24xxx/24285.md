We perform some cleaning

- move the conversion `number field -> ball` in the files relative to number fields (creation of methds `_arb_` and `_acb_` for that purpose)
- remove c++ clumsy dependency (ntl for number fields)
- `with X bits precision` -> `with X bits of precision` in string representation

(follow up #24318)
(this is part of the task ticket #24289)

> Quick comments (no time for a full review before several weeks):

Thanks for having a quick look already. After reading your comments I would propose to:
- make this ticket only about moving number field stuff and C++ care
- open a more general ticket about "convergence between real intervals and balls"

> I like some of the refactoring you did, especially the part related to the interface with number fields and the NTL dependency.

Indeed. If you try to use Cython in a `pyx` file and use balls you are in troubles because there is no proper distutils directive in the headers. Moreover, it make more sense implemented that way.

> However, I feel that using a Cython class for the parent is a big step backward. The only advantage I see is that it should make accessing the precision field much faster, but there are other ways to do that—even storing a copy of the precision in every ball would be a better option IMO—and to date it wasn't much of an issue in my benchmarks anyway. Do you have other reasons for making this change?

Why would you prefer a Python class over an extension class inside a `pyx` file? To benefit from `UniqueRepresentation`?

The real point is: "How do you create a ball from nothing in Cython?". This is needed here in the code

```
def _arb_(self, R):
    cdef RealBall x = ---> what do I put here? <----
```
The way it is for interval is at least simple `R._new()`. And I just copied it for balls. I really dislike how people implementing balls just made their own coding conventions. I do not discuss the fact that they might be better (sometimes they do). Just the fact that they are different. The two interfaces should just be the same.

> I have mixed feelings about the change to `_repr_()`, which may break users' doctests just to fix a cosmetic issue, but I won't fight against it.

Same comment applies: uniformity with real intervals. (BTW, a docstring is not any serious doctest breaking)

To benefit from `UniqueRepresentation`?\n\nYes, and there are real benefits. The first is that by using a custom cache, you are making a strong reference to each parent. With `UniqueRepresentation`, it is only a weak reference, so you do not get the parents nailed in memory. It also is far less clean code:\n\n- You lose localization of the input and code; in particular, you either have duplicate documentation or either the creation function or object is lacking in documentation.\n- (Essentially) Duplicate code:\n\n  - You have to maintain the cache.\n  - You do not have the guarantees of uniqueness unless you handle pickles, `__copy__`, etc.\n  - You have to handle pickles.\n  - You have to handle comparisons.\n\n- Comparisons are now slower because they are not by `id`.\n\nSo I also think removing the `UniqueRepresentation` inheritance is a big step backwards. I do not see why you need the parent to be a `cdef` class. This does not seem to be a common optimization of creating an uninitialized ball, so just put `<RealBall> (RealBall.__new__(RealBall, R))` the place you need it. Yes, readability suffers slightly, but I think that is a marginal concern for code that is being optimized to the extent that you care about creating an uninitialized object in contrast to `RealBall(R)`.",

Yes, and there are real benefits. The first is that by using a custom cache, you are making a strong reference to each parent. With `UniqueRepresentation`, it is only a weak reference, so you do not get the parents nailed in memory. It also is far less clean code:

- You lose localization of the input and code; in particular, you either have duplicate documentation or either the creation function or object is lacking in documentation.
- (Essentially) Duplicate code:

  - You have to maintain the cache.
  - You do not have the guarantees of uniqueness unless you handle pickles, `__copy__`, etc.
  - You have to handle pickles.
  - You have to handle comparisons.

- Comparisons are now slower because they are not by `id`.

So I also think removing the `UniqueRepresentation` inheritance is a big step backwards. I do not see why you need the parent to be a `cdef` class. This does not seem to be a common optimization of creating an uninitialized ball, so just put `<RealBall> (RealBall.__new__(RealBall, R))` the place you need it. Yes, readability suffers slightly, but I think that is a marginal concern for code that is being optimized to the extent that you care about creating an uninitialized object in contrast to `RealBall(R)`.

Looks reasonable to me, but I only skimmed through the code.

Why remove the ability to construct a complex ball from a machine integer? Since this is something supported by arb, `ComplexBall.__cinit__` does look like the most natural place for it to me.

Typos: “that the map go through”, ”cancellationss”.

Vincent: Yes, I'll try to see if I can do something with my old branch(es) about intervals, post my comments on the other ticket, etc. ...but not now.

It does work through `int -> ZZ` when you call `RBF(14r)` which is just fine. What would be the point of having one more special case in the init for something that is anyway slow because of Python and will be useless in Python3?

> Since this is something supported by arb, `ComplexBall.__cinit__` does look like the most natural place for it to me.

Note that it used to be in `__init__` and not `__cinit__`. I does think that `__cinit__` should do the minimal job (memory allocation) and not set any value. If the user wants quick initialization she uses arb functions directly as in

```
cdef RealBall a = RealBall.__new__(RealBall)
a._parent = TheParent      # can possibly move in __cinit__?
arb_set_si(a.value, 13)
```

> Typos: “that the map go through”

is that a typo?

> ”cancellationss”.

Should be "that the map goes through".

I'm not sure it needs to be that slow when called from Cython code, but I admit I didn't measure. I don't really care anyway.

Yes, that's what I meant, sorry. As far as I can say, the general logic how how constructors are organized in the arb interface is that (i) `__cinit__()` does basic initialization, (ii) `__init__()` wraps the C-level intializers provided by arb (and should be reasonably fast), and (iii) `_element_constructor_()`, conversion morphisms and the like take care of everything else. This organization has pros and cons, but it sort of makes sense to me.

Actually this change:

```
-        elif isinstance(other, number_field.NumberField_quadratic):
[...]
+        from sage.rings.number_field.number_field_base import is_NumberField
+        if is_NumberField(other):
             emb = other.coerce_embedding()
-            if emb is not None:
-                return self.has_coerce_map_from(emb.codomain())
+            return emb is not None and self.has_coerce_map_from(emb.codomain())
 ```
is not correct, because the ball constructor only accepts *quadratic* NF elements. NF elements of higher degree can be converted to complex balls, but only through CLF or CIF.

Fixed at #24621.
