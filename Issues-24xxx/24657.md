Correction: #26288 (upgrading `mathplotlib` to `2.2.3`) doesn't fix it.

#22380 (upgrading `cvxopt` to `1.2.2`) doesn't fix it either and nor does combining both #26288 and #22380.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

The spkg goes out of its way to run the examples rather than cvxopt own test suite.

```
for di in "$CUR"/src/examples/doc/chap* ; do
    echo "Testing in $di"
    cd "$di"
    for i in `ls | grep -v bin` ; do
        echo "Testing $i ..."
        sage-python23 $i
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error: test $di/$i failed"
            exit 1
        fi
    done
done
```
But looking at upstream `.travis.yml` this is what you sould use to run cvxopt's testsuite

```
script:
  - python -c 'from cvxopt import blas,lapack,glpk,fftw,dsdp,gsl,cholmod,umfpack'
  - py.test --cov=cvxopt tests/
```
Of course that implies that pytest and some of its components be installed which is not the case of the default sage. But the failure is clearly self inflicted, running as tests something that wasn't meant to be one. Is it also the case in debian?

In this light, what should we do about cvxopt's spkg-check file?
