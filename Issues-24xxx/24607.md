In order to fix all `Compatible but non-identical C method '_add_' not redeclared in definition part of extension type '...'.  This may cause incorrect vtables to be generated.` warnings, we add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to some base `Element` classes.

This is part of #23600.

In #24116, such abstract methods were added to the finite ring element base class. Those can be removed again.
