I attempted to build Sage with clang, with `CC=clang CXX="clang++ -I/usr/include/libcxxabi/ --stdlib=libc++" make`. Note that fpylll does not complain (see #24707).

I get two failing packages: sagelib (see #24705) and ratpoints. Here is the 
[ratpoints log](http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/logs/ratpoints-2.1.3.p4.log) I guess the ratpoints developers should be contacted, but I don't know how.

Keywords: ratpoints clang

Upstream: None of the above - read trac for reasoning.

Status: new

OK, but it is still a standard package and is supposed to work, right?

Converting PARI integers to gmp integers? :-) You may be interested in the [paritwine library](http://www.multiprecision.org/paritwine/home.html)

One gotcha I encountered in #24531: the original version of ratpoints was checking for *projective* points, while the PARI version only checks for *affine* points. Not a big deal, but that difference was initially causing some mysterious failures in #24531.

<a id='comment:8'></a>The error points at a GCC-specific macro `__builtin_ia32_andps` being used.
Not sure if it's inside ratpoints, or wrong a header being pulled in.
(I'm away from the computer till Thurs)


---

Regarding deprecating ratpoints - could one point me out where this was decided?
(Yes, there is #24531, which I find a bit too quick).

IMHO it's good to have more than one working implementation of tricky functionality.

Last time I did changes to ratpoints (on #12473) I reported them upstream.
Perhaps I should ping for a new release...

That macro is in ratpoints in the source file rp-private.h:

```
#define AND(a,b) ((ratpoints_bit_array)__builtin_ia32_andps((__v4sf)(a), (__v4sf)(b)))
```

which does not look hard to avoid.

The PARI implementation and ratpoints implementation are not independent, PARI essentially copied the ratpoints code. Anyway, this should be discussed on #24531.
