<a id='comment:6'></a>This documentation is really helpful!

Suggestions:

- In `src/doc/en/reference/functions/index.rst`, add a link to `src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx`
- Presumably you meant to remove the fragment at the end of this line

```
+ * :class:`BuiltinFunction`: the code of these functions is written in Python; many special functions are of this type, see :doc
```

This may be out-of-scope for this ticket but it's so trivial that I must point it out:

- There is a formatting error in the docstring for `sage.symbolic.function.get_sfunction_from_serial`, there should be double backticks around `sage.symbolic.function.sfunction_serial_dict`

Indeed. It was working in my case probably because the referred document had been already created by a previous `make doc`.

Another solution would be to add a tag in `src/doc/en/reference/functions/index.rst`,  `special-functions` say, and refer to it as `:ref:`list <special-functions>``.

<a id='comment:18'></a>This seems to work, thanks.
I'd rather use tag names like

```
+.. _calculus-index:
```
than

```
+.. _symbolic-calculus:
```
to make it more clear where it points to.

We have quite a number of links like `<../../../foo/index.html>` in `src/sage`, perhaps all such links should be replaces the way you propose?

I also wonder whether we should rather be using https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosectionlabel.html
which apparently allows using headings as labels, and so explicit tags won't be needed
(I must say I don't know how to enable it in our oh so transparent sphinx configs...)

As far as I know, the tags only work within a single sphinx document, but we have many documents which is a reason for many of the relative links to exist.

Not always: the following links are inside the same document (the reference manual):

```
rings/big_oh.py:    - `asymptotic expansions <../../../asymptotic/index.html>`_
rings/big_oh.py:    - `p-adic numbers <../../../padics/index.html>`_
rings/big_oh.py:    - `power series <../../../power_series/index.html>`_
rings/big_oh.py:    - `polynomials <../../../polynomial_rings/index.html>`_
rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.py:`coercion <../../../../coercion/index.html>`_. 
```
