Nice!

For each function, the documentation string should follow the rules listed at
    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content

That is: a short one-line sentence description followed by an optional longer paragraph.

mpmath has a multiprecision version if necessary but hopefully we can just get away with the single precision version here.

I have also used precision where relevant, and in bits, not in decimal digits.\n\nThere is just one problem remaining, which is the extraction of an invertible submatrix. I have used scipy.linalg.lu, but it gives an extremely uninformative error message. Moreover, that function seems to work for some matrices and fail for others, which does not help to isolate the source of the error. To see what I am talking about, try using invertible_submatrix_lu.

Thanks for all your comments!

I pulled Nils' modifications (please check) and added functionality for homomorphisms and isomorphisms as well. I will soon add some files that test this in Attachments.

I modified the descriptions to start with a single one-line summary. I have also used precision where relevant, and in bits, not in decimal digits.

There is just one problem remaining, which is the extraction of an invertible submatrix. I have used scipy.linalg.lu, but it gives an extremely uninformative error message. Moreover, that function seems to work for some matrices and fail for others, which does not help to isolate the source of the error. To see what I am talking about, try using invertible_submatrix_lu. I truly have no idea what to do to get this to work, but perhaps someone else sees a simple fix.

scipy failure: You're hitting fortran code here. It's hard to imagine it would be capable of working with sage multiprecision floats. If you convert to python standard complex floats it's probably OK:

```
def invertible_submatrix_lu(M):
    Mt = M.transpose()
    rowsMt = Mt.rows()
    colsMt = Mt.columns()
    ccMt=scipy.matrix([[p.__complex__() for p in r] for r in Mt ])
    P, L, U = lu(ccMt)
    rowsP = matrix(P).rows()
    col_nums = [ ]
    for i in range(len(rowsP)):
        if any([ (rowsP[i][j].abs() > 0.1) for j in range(len(colsMt)) ]):
            col_nums.append(i)
    subM = Matrix([ rowsMt[i] for i in col_nums ]).transpose()
    return subM, col_nums
```
At least it helps with the example you gave.

Another observation: 

The first block of the large period matrix `P=(A|B)` MUST be invertible (these are the integrals wrt to first half of the symplectic basis).

```
        P = self.period_matrix()

        g = P.nrows()
        s = range(g)
        subP = (P[:g,:g]).inverse()
        Ts = [(Q*R)[:,:g].transpose() * subP for R in Rs]
        return [ T.change_ring(P.base_ring()) for T in Ts ]
```
(if you need the number of rows you shouldn't ask for the length of the list constructed from the rows. Slicing vs. submatrix is probably just a matter of taste)

Another point: I see that "automorphism group" now returns a permutation group. I think you should also return the action of the group on something meaningful (returning the thing as a matrix group as was done previously did that).

```
R.<x,y>=QQ[]
f = x^10 + y^10 + x^3*y^3 + 1

S=C.riemann_surface()
%time M=S.period_matrix()

Thank you, Julian!

I've run the doctests and I get good results:

My own build has some failing tests, but those aren't due to the commits here; and neither are the problems that the bots report. So: positive it is. Great work.

This is because #24742 disallows using strings to construct matrix entries.

I think that the old code

```
    names = ["%s%s"%(n, i+1) for n in ["a","b","c","d"] for i in range(g**2)]
    R = PolynomialRing(CC, names)
    vars = R.gens()
    A = Matrix(R, g, g, vars[:g**2])
    B = Matrix(R, g, g, vars[g**2:2*g**2])
    C = Matrix(R, g, g, vars[2*g**2:3*g**2])
    D = Matrix(R, g, g, vars[3*g**2:4*g**2])
```
is clearly better than the new code from this ticket

```
    V = ["%s%s"%(n,i) for n in ["a","b","c","d"] for i in srange(1,1+g1*g2)]
    R = PolynomialRing(CC,V)
    A = Matrix(R,g1,g2,V[:g1*g2])
    B = Matrix(R,g1,g2,V[g1*g2:2*g1*g2])
    C = Matrix(R,g1,g2,V[2*g1*g2:3*g1*g2])
    D = Matrix(R,g1,g2,V[3*g1*g2:4*g1*g2])
