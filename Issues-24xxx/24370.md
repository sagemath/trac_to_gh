For each function, the documentation string should follow the rules listed at

mpmath has a multiprecision version if necessary but hopefully we can just get away with the single precision version here.

I pulled Nils' modifications (please check) and added functionality for homomorphisms and isomorphisms as well. I will soon add some files that test this in Attachments.

I modified the descriptions to start with a single one-line summary. I have also used precision where relevant, and in bits, not in decimal digits.

There is just one problem remaining, which is the extraction of an invertible submatrix. I have used scipy.linalg.lu, but it gives an extremely uninformative error message. Moreover, that function seems to work for some matrices and fail for others, which does not help to isolate the source of the error. To see what I am talking about, try using invertible_submatrix_lu. I truly have no idea what to do to get this to work, but perhaps someone else sees a simple fix.

At least it helps with the example you gave.

Another observation: 

The first block of the large period matrix `P=(A|B)` MUST be invertible (these are the integrals wrt to first half of the symplectic basis). In fact, to get the small period matrix we compute `A^(-1)*B` anyway. So: is it worth looking for a "better" invertible submatrix than just the first block? I doubt it.

<a id='comment:24'></a>You should pull out the inverse from the loop, of course :-).

If course, if you think we have enough precision lying around already to get better results by doing the intermediate computations at a higher precision then you should do that explicitly. So I think the body can be shortened to something along the lines of:

```
        P = self.period_matrix()
        Q = other.period_matrix()
        g = P.nrows()
        s = range(g)
        subP = (P[:g,:g]).inverse()
        Ts = [(Q*R)[:,:g].transpose() * subP for R in Rs]
        return [ T.change_ring(P.base_ring()) for T in Ts ]
```
(if you need the number of rows you shouldn't ask for the length of the list constructed from the rows. Slicing vs. submatrix is probably just a matter of taste)

Another point: I see that "automorphism group" now returns a permutation group. I think you should also return the action of the group on something meaningful (returning the thing as a matrix group as was done previously did that).

I've run the doctests and I get good results:

My own build has some failing tests, but those aren't due to the commits here; and neither are the problems that the bots report. So: positive it is. Great work.
