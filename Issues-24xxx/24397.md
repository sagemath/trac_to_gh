sage: f = function('f')
sage: f(1, 2)._convert(RR)
f(1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
```
This loses information that might be needed by the function. Some functions might even require exact arguments for correct results.

This ticket tracks and doctests the Pynac fix.

Upstream: Reported upstream. Developers deny it's a bug.

Resolution: wontfix
