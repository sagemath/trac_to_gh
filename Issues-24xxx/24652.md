This currently fails:

```
sage: i = var('i')
sage: ua = unicode_art(sum(pi^i/factorial(i)*x^i, i, 0, oo))
sage: unicode(ua)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-13a6120e2b40> in <module>()
----> 1 unicode(ua)

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xcf in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
```
which means we cannot add `UnicodeArt` objects to `format` like we can with `AsciiArt` objects:

```
sage: u"{}".format(ua)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)

Probably will not be an issue on Python3, but it lingers around while we have Python2. This was the best way I know of to fix this, but let me know if there is a better way.

Okay, on closer look I think this is actually pretty orthogonal to my other updates to that package.  I'm a bit iffy on the `.decode('utf-8')`, but since this code will only run on Python 2 anyways I don't mind.

Please just add a `# py2` comment to the `sage: unicode(ua)` test (since it won't work on Python 3), and maybe add a Python 3 equivalent of the test:

```
sage: str(ua)  # py3
' \u03c0\u22c5x\n\u212f   '
```

Even though `__unicode__` won't be used on Python 3, it's still nice to demonstrate that there's no regression in this use case on Python 3.
