- `Genus_enumerate` is an awkward name to me. It seems like `(global_)genera` is a better name.
- Have you thought about making your functions iterators?
- I do not see how the result could be nondeterministic. Can you explain why this could happen?
- You should also do `foo is None` instead of `foo == None`.
- You should remove the list in `all` and instead use an iterator; i.e., `all(test for x in foo)` instead of `all([test for x in foo])`.
- I am not sure it is worthwhile to test that `even` is a bool.

Dear Travis thank you for your comments.
As for the name: The function should be easy to discover.
Type Genus + auto complete and the name appears.
I am thinking of BinaryQF and BinaryQF_reduced_representatives.
But genera is a possible name. 

Guess I could make them iterators.

After a second thought I do not want to make them iterators. 
For one iterators are less convenient for the user. Further
for the 2-adic symbols we are overcounting and then removing duplicates. 
I do not see how to do this properly with an iterator.

Writing in the quadratic forms class

works.

The latter does not make sense (at least with the context given here). `genera` is a function, so why should it be a ``@`staticmethod`?

I do not like `QuadraticFormsGenera` because it is a function, not a class. So following Python naming conventions, I would use `quadratic_forms_genera`.
