I think this should be addressed by [upstream cypari2](https://github.com/defeo/cypari2). The point is that GP provides shortcut to access some members

```
$ gp
? K = bnfinit(x^3 - 2);
? bnf = bnfinit(x^3 - 2);
? bnf.nf     /* = bnf[7] */
%3 = [x^3 - 2, [1, 1], -108, 1, ...]
? bnf.clgp   /* = bnf[8][1] */
%4 = [1, [], []]
```
(these do not exist in the PARI library). The same shortcuts should be available on the `Gen` type

```
sage: K = pari.bnfinit('x^3 - 2')
sage: K.nf
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'cypari2.gen.Gen' object has no attribute 'nf'
```
