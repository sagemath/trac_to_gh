Often, the same morphism can be created as different Python classes. For example, these are two versions of the identity map on `QQ`:

```
sage: H = End(QQ)
sage: f = H.identity()
sage: g = H(1)
sage: type(f)
<type 'sage.categories.morphism.IdentityMorphism'>
sage: type(g)
<type 'sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens'>
```

The problem is that these may not compare equal because most comparison functions for morphisms consider morphisms not equal if they have different types:

```
sage: g == f
False
sage: f == g
True
```

The solution is to implement a generic comparison function for morphisms. We do this by checking whether two maps have the same image on the generators and recursively on the base ring.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I think having the checks that the (co)domains matched was a good first check because that should be very quick (generally, a comparison of `id`s). Moreover, with your code, you can get equality of morphisms when there is a coercion from one codomain into the other that results in equal elements.

```
sage: D = ZZ['x']
sage: C1 = ZZ['x']
sage: C2 = QQ['x']
sage: phi = D.morphism(C1.gens())
sage: psi = D.morphism(C2.gens())
sage: Morphism._richcmp_(psi, phi, 2)  # 2 == Py_EQ
True
```
However, we do not want these to be equal as we then have an isomorphism equal to a non-surjective map. A more minimal example that directly uses the `Morphism._richcmp_`:

```
sage: IZZ = Hom(ZZ,ZZ).natural_map()
sage: IQQ = Hom(QQ,QQ).natural_map()
sage: IZZ._richcmp_(IQQ, 2)
True
```
(Although I do not understand why `==` is returning `False` in both of these cases.)

Also, why did you remove the `_richcmp_` for `MatrixMorphism`? I know that might generally involve more comparisons, but it still should require less CPU cycles because you do not have to apply the morphisms.

This is currently the biggest example of that general shortcoming and should be addressed at some point. Although I guess in some ways with how we do things with extension classes, it works, but I am fairly certain we loose stuff from the categories when using Python classes.

I see.

The earlier error is making me think a bit more about using `gens` in the general morphism code. I don't think this suffers from the same problem as #15381. Yet, we probably want to return a `NotImplemented` when `gens` is not defined (maybe also catching if it raises some [reasonable] error?).

Not sure about that. I like explicit errors, such as an `AttributeError` when there is no `gens()`.

Since it makes the problem no worse than before, we can just let it be.

I guess we have a little more freedom with raising errors than `__contains__` (which should never raise an error). However, because of the type of error and how generic this code it suppose to be, I feel such an error strongly suggests that parent classes should implement `gens` in contrast to `*_generators` and having the appropriate category redirect from `gens` or perhaps where it is not a natural construct (say a combinatorial set). I guess since this is post-coercion, having it raise an error is saying something about the implementation of either the underlying object or their morphisms and you don't have any more fragile code by comparing a `X - > Y` and `X' -> Y` morphism, where `X` and `X'` might be in completely different categories. So I guess it is okay.

The only other thing I would like is a doctest for `_richcmp_`, preferably one that was incorrect before and now succeeds and the `QQ` vs `ZZ` example with something like

```
While this compares by generators (which can use coercion), the coercion model
is first invoked to guarantee that domains must match in order to have the
same parent for the morphisms::

    sage: phi = Hom(ZZ,ZZ).natural_map()
    sage: psi = Hom(QQ,QQ).natural_map(
    sage: Morphism._richcmp_(phi, psi, 2)
    True
    sage: phi == psi
    False
```

Yea, that was perhaps a bit too short and poorly written. There are two things:

1. A category that does not have a natural notation of `gens` such as `EnumeratedSets()`. Then morphisms in that category should override the `_richcmp_` because more information is necessary (it would normally have to provide it anyways).

   The problem I have with having it raise an `AttributeError` on `gens` is that it suggests that the user should implement a `gens` rather than give an (overriding) implementation of `_richcmp_`. So I feel that it sends the wrong message in these cases.

   Also, mostly just to note, this will be a behavior change that might result in code breaking in the wild.

2. Suppose you have `f: X -> Y` and `g: X' -> Y`, where the category of `X` is, e.g., `Algebras(ZZ)` and `X'` is `Modules(ZZ)` with `X'` being `X` under the forgetful functor. However, because this would happen post-coercion (assuming smart enough homsets and coercion code), the object `X` should become `X'` and so `gens` would be the basis rather than the algebra generators.

   Although I do not think our coercion and functor code is smart enough to handle this sort of situation right now anyways. The thought I had is that it really used the algebra generators of `X` to do the comparison, which may result in wrong answers because `g` is not an algebra morphism but matches on the algebra generators.

Does that clarify things?

> I agree that `gens()` might not be ideal, but that is really an issue for #15381.


I'm not completely sure that #15381 is relevant for not using `gens`, but your changes are no worse than before too. So this is not a blocker for a positive review.

I do not consider this to be a bug. Yet, I don't think it is a spacebar-esqe in the sense there might be someone who is relying on this behavior in a non-horrifying way. However, raising an error in this case will not be a blocker from me either.

I added a test of the `parent()`. That makes the example do at least something non-trivial.
