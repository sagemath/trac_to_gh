Currently, orders are not unique parents

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: loads(dumps(K.maximal_order())) is K.maximal_order()
False
```

However, `order` and `maximal_order` rely on a `@cached_method`, so you usually don't see this behaviour:

```
sage: K.maximal_order() is K.maximal_order()
True
```

This ticket fixes this by creating orders in a factory.

This ticket also drops the keyword `allow_subfield` that did not really do anything before, see #16046.

So in my mind, it is a technical debt taken on to use `UniqueFactory` when not necessary and not simply a matter of taste.
