For an elliptic curve E, a natural number n, and a number field K, the n-division field of E over K is the smallest extension of K that contains all the coordinates of the n-torsion subgroup.

Currently, only the prime case is implemented. This ticket aims to implement the composite case.

There's also a small typo in the proof of the theorem within the current code (L501 of ell_number_field.py) that should be fixed.

Component: **elliptic curves**
