I have the same uneasiness about it but couldn't think of a better name at the time.  I think for now I'll keep just "char" for consistency's sake, unless you also want to rename `char_to_str`.

I still believe just "char" is clear enough in context, though I do like "cstr".

I think this is still worth fixing:

> I think what might make sense, for symmetry's sake, might be to rename the original `bitset_from_str` to `bitset_from_char`  (as in `char *`) and then make `bitset_from_str` a wrapper around that which uses `str_to_bytes`.

There's also the matter of Jeroen's bikeshed about the name, but I think I addressed that above.

Reworked this a bit more.  In addition to the original changes from this branch, I also updated `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` to work on bytes instead of str, and I renamed the original `bitset_string` function to `bitset_bytes`, but also added a new `bitset_string` that returns a `str` on Python 3.

I think everything should work on Python 2 as well.  I tested all the modules that use this class directly, at least.
