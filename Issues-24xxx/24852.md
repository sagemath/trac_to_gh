I have the same uneasiness about it but couldn't think of a better name at the time.  I think for now I'll keep just "char" for consistency's sake, unless you also want to rename `char_to_str`.

I still believe just "char" is clear enough in context, though I do like "cstr".

Ok, but I think you underestimate yourself.  It's mainly just a simple str/bytes conversion issue.

The existing function maed `bitset_from_str` originally took a `char *` as its argument, which won't make sense for Python 3 str, so I changed it to accept a generic `object` instead and use `str_to_bytes` on it.

Jeroen's suggestion was that we keep the original implementation of `bitset_from_str`, but rename it to something like `bitset_from_char`, keeping the original `char *` interface, then add a new `bitset_from_str` which on Python 2 can easily just be an easily for `bitset_from_str`, and on Python 3 would call `str_to_bytes` and pass that to `bitset_from_char`.

Well, I've got 30 minutes to kill. So I'll take a look at it now.

Reworked this a bit more.  In addition to the original changes from this branch, I also updated `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` to work on bytes instead of str, and I renamed the original `bitset_string` function to `bitset_bytes`, but also added a new `bitset_string` that returns a `str` on Python 3.

I think everything should work on Python 2 as well.  I tested all the modules that use this class directly, at least.
