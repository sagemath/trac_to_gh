I haven't studied the math in these cases but just to be sure, are you sure these are supposed to be integer division in all these cases?  It looks like most of them want integer results, but I'd want to be sure.  Have you tested these changes?

There could be some slight doubts only in

* 	src/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra_bases.py
* 	src/sage/modular/btquotients/pautomorphicform.py

but all tests pass in these files. And in these files, the cases of possible doubt are all wrapped with ZZ() or range().

So, this leaves me pretty confident that the math is ok.
