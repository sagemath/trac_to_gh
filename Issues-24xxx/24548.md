<a id='comment:4'></a>There could be some slight doubts only in

* 	src/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra_bases.py
* 	src/sage/modular/btquotients/pautomorphicform.py

but all tests pass in these files. And in these files, the cases of possible doubt are all wrapped with ZZ() or range().

So, this leaves me pretty confident that the math is ok.

Also: adding `from __future__ import division` affects *all* divisions in that file. In general, I think that adding `from __future__ import division` is a good idea. But it does mean that one should verify all divisions.
