[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: G.edges_incident([1,2], labels=False)

I would expect that `G.edges_incident` returns a subset of `G.edges`

This is due to method `iterator_edges` of the `static_sparse_graph` backend.

```
sage: G = (graphs.PathGraph(4)).relabel(immutable=True, inplace=False)
sage: G._backend
<sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend.StaticSparseBackend object at 0x2198ceea8>
sage: G.edges_incident([1,2], labels=False)
[(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: list(G.edge_iterator([1,2], labels=False))
[(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage:
sage: G = (graphs.PathGraph(4)).relabel(immutable=False, inplace=False)
sage: G._backend

No, this is not an acceptable solution. We do our best to provide as fast as possible solutions and making a copy of the graph is a too expensive operation for this purpose. Furthermore, it is not algorithmically sounded as it relies only on the way the copy is done. 

The problem must be fixed in the backend.

I  see 2 issues in your code

```diff
-                if j < i and j in b_vertices:
-                    continue
+
+                # Guarantees that vertex ordering is consistent
+                if j < i:
+                    if j in b_vertices:
+                        continue
+                    else:
+                        v1, v2 = self._vertex_to_labels[j], vi
+                else:
+                    v1, v2 = vi, self._vertex_to_labels[j]
```

- an an edge can now be returned twice. Before an edge was returned only when `j >= i`
- you assume that if `i < j` then the label of `i` is smaller than the label of `j`, but there is no reason for that.

- The edges returned are the same edges as the ones returned before: which was when `j>=i or  j not in b_vertices`. I used a nested if statement to minimize the performance penalty from this change.

- I am not claiming that the output edge (v1, v2) will satisfy v1 < v2, in fact the vertex labels might not even be comparable. I am only guaranteeing that if the edge is output as (v1, v2), then any other time this edge appears (in a different call), only (v1, v2) will be seen and not (v2, v1). I believe this fixes the issue because `G.edges` also internally calls `iterator_edges`.

Right, I was too fast in real the code.
