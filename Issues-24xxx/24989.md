- an an edge can now be returned twice. Before an edge was returned only when `j >= i`
- you assume that if `i < j` then the label of `i` is smaller than the label of `j`, but there is no reason for that.

- The edges returned are the same edges as the ones returned before: which was when `j>=i or  j not in b_vertices`. I used a nested if statement to minimize the performance penalty from this change.

- I am not claiming that the output edge (v1, v2) will satisfy v1 < v2, in fact the vertex labels might not even be comparable. I am only guaranteeing that if the edge is output as (v1, v2), then any other time this edge appears (in a different call), only (v1, v2) will be seen and not (v2, v1). I believe this fixes the issue because `G.edges` also internally calls `iterator_edges`.
