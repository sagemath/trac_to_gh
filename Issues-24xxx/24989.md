[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: G.edges_incident([1,2], labels=False)

I would expect that `G.edges_incident` returns a subset of `G.edges`

This is due to method `iterator_edges` of the `static_sparse_graph` backend.

```
sage: G = (graphs.PathGraph(4)).relabel(immutable=True, inplace=False)
sage: G._backend
<sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend.StaticSparseBackend object at 0x2198ceea8>
sage: G.edges_incident([1,2], labels=False)
[(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: list(G.edge_iterator([1,2], labels=False))
[(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage:
sage: G = (graphs.PathGraph(4)).relabel(immutable=False, inplace=False)
sage: G._backend
<sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend object at 0x218d369d0>
sage: G.edges_incident([1,2], labels=False)
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
sage: list(G.edge_iterator([1,2], labels=False))

```

- an an edge can now be returned twice. Before an edge was returned only when `j >= i`
- you assume that if `i < j` then the label of `i` is smaller than the label of `j`, but there is no reason for that.

- The edges returned are the same edges as the ones returned before: which was when `j>=i or  j not in b_vertices`. I used a nested if statement to minimize the performance penalty from this change.

- I am not claiming that the output edge (v1, v2) will satisfy v1 < v2, in fact the vertex labels might not even be comparable. I am only guaranteeing that if the edge is output as (v1, v2), then any other time this edge appears (in a different call), only (v1, v2) will be seen and not (v2, v1). I believe this fixes the issue because `G.edges` also internally calls `iterator_edges`.

Right, I was too fast in real the code.

I did some tests and it seems ok, but let's wait for the patchbot.
