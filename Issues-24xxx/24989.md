I would expect that `G.edges_incident` returns a subset of `G.edges`

This is due to method `iterator_edges` of the `static_sparse_graph` backend.

```
sage: G = (graphs.PathGraph(4)).relabel(immutable=True, inplace=False)
sage: G._backend

I  see 2 issues in your code

```diff
-                if j < i and j in b_vertices:
-                    continue
+
+                # Guarantees that vertex ordering is consistent
+                if j < i:
+                    if j in b_vertices:
+                        continue
+                    else:
+                        v1, v2 = self._vertex_to_labels[j], vi
+                else:
+                    v1, v2 = vi, self._vertex_to_labels[j]
```

- an an edge can now be returned twice. Before an edge was returned only when `j >= i`
- you assume that if `i < j` then the label of `i` is smaller than the label of `j`, but there is no reason for that.

- The edges returned are the same edges as the ones returned before: which was when `j>=i or  j not in b_vertices`. I used a nested if statement to minimize the performance penalty from this change.

- I am not claiming that the output edge (v1, v2) will satisfy v1 < v2, in fact the vertex labels might not even be comparable. I am only guaranteeing that if the edge is output as (v1, v2), then any other time this edge appears (in a different call), only (v1, v2) will be seen and not (v2, v1). I believe this fixes the issue because `G.edges` also internally calls `iterator_edges`.

Right, I was too fast in real the code.

I did some tests and it seems ok, but let's wait for the patchbot.
