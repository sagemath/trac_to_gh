```
First, when trying to `sage -i r_jupyter`, the install fails since the `spkg-install` script is not executable (apparently nobody tried to install that package for a while):

```
cd '/opt/sagemath/sage-source' && \
    source '/opt/sagemath/sage-source/src/bin/sage-env' && \
    sage-logger -p '/opt/sagemath/sage-source/build/pkgs/r_jupyter/spkg-install' /opt/sagemath/sage-source/logs/pkgs/r_jupyter.log
[r_jupyter] /opt/sagemath/sage-source/build/bin/sage-logger: line 89: /opt/sagemath/sage-source/build/pkgs/r_jupyter/spkg-install: Permission denied
```

Then, if i make that file executable, the script does not work at all:

```
[r_jupyter] Warning message:
[r_jupyter] package 'IRkernel' is not available (for R version 3.4.3) 
[r_jupyter] > IRkernel::installspec()
[r_jupyter] Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'IRkernel'
[r_jupyter] Calls: :: ... tryCatch -> tryCatchList -> tryCatchOne -> <Anonymous>
[r_jupyter] Execution halted
```

Documentation can be found at https://irkernel.github.io/installation/

We modify it so that the kernel is installed at the right place (otherwise it is installed in the user's `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/ir/` directory).

`r_jupyter` has been uninstallable for a long time : its installation procedure refers to outdated locations. I have been installing IRkernel "by hand"  for a while.

The problem is that [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) is not (yet) on CRAN ; their authors say they intend to subit it  [soon](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel#installation) to CRAN, bu have intended so for a looong time.

Meanwhile, CRAN recently accepted a new [Junyper](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuniperKernel/index.html) package which seems to be an(other) interface between R an Jupyter. A simple skimming of its [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuniperKernel/JuniperKernel.pdf) lets me think that this could be an alternative to IRkernel.

I'll have to test this, but that won't be soon (some RealLife(TM) emergencies to fix...).

[ Sorry for the delay : this patch fell in the black hole I use as my *To Do* list...]

The current Github `README.md` installs only `IRkernel` from Github. and indeed, [crayon](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crayon/index.html), [repr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crayon/index.html) and [IRdisplay](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IRdisplay/index.html) are all installable from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

I think that we should follow this policy (depend as little as possible on non-CRAN packages).

+1 to install the kernel in the common repository for Sage kernels.

==>`needs_work`. I may do this if you wish (and can review it).

OTOH, the [Juniper](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuniperKernel/index.html) kernel is also an attractive alternative, which is available via CRAN, but is still a [tad](https://github.com/JuniperKernel/JuniperKernel/issues/29) [immature](https://github.com/JuniperKernel/JuniperKernel/issues/27).

When matured, it might be proposed as an alternative or as a substitute to `r_jupyter`.
