I don't like this change. It will make it *harder* to port Sage to Python 3 by hiding errors in an `try`/`except` block.

It would be much better to just not compare types in the first place.

If you say so--does this actually break anything?

FWIW I have personally written code before that implements comparisons between metaclasses (!).  I don't understand the implications when it comes to Sage though.
