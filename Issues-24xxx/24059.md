This still isn't how we want to go about doing this, as discussed in other tickets...

The problem with littering the sources with `.decode('utf-8')` are many:

* (minor) It's just kind of ugly, not very easy to grep for, and not always clear what the intent is
* On Python 2 it means you're returning `unicode` objects in code that previous just used `str`.  In my experience, when porting Py2 code to work on both Py2 and Py3 code it's best that objects that were already `str` remain as `str`.  That way everything works the same as it did before in Python 2.  And in Python 3 `str` is almost always preferable as well.  There are exceptions to this where on Python 3 you want a `bytes` object, but in those cases on Python 2 it still remains as `str`.  You never want a `unicode` object in Python 2 except in those cases where unicode text was previously expected and supported.
* In some cases just assuming 'utf-8' is unsafe.  For example when decoding text that contains filesystem paths use `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` (this is also never 100% guaranteed to work but it covers the most common cases correctly across platforms).

I suggest adding a couple utility functions that look something like this:

```python
import six

DEFAULT_ENCODING = 'utf-8'

if six.PY2:
    def `_to_`str(b, encoding):
        return b
else:
    def `_to_`str(b, encoding):
        return b.decode(encoding, errors='surrogateescape')


def to_str(b, encoding=DEFAULT_ENCODING):
    r"""
    Takes a `bytes` object and returns a `str`.

    On Python 2 this is a no-op since `bytes is str`.  On Python 3 this decodes
    the given bytes with the specified encoding and returns a `str`.

    Examples:

        >>> to_str(b'abc')
        'abc'
        >>> to_str(b'\xe2\x98\x83')
        '☃'

    """

    return `_to_`str(b, encoding)


if six.PY2:
    def `_to_`bytes(s, encoding):
        return s
else:
    def `_to_`bytes(s, encoding):
        return s.encode(encoding, errors='surrogateescape')


def to_bytes(s, encoding=DEFAULT_ENCODING):
    """
    Takes a `str` object and returns a `bytes`.  Basically the opposite of
    `to_str`.

    As with `to_str`, on Python 2 this is a no-op since `str` is `bytes`,
    whereas on Python 3 the given string is encoding with the specified
    encoding and a `bytes` is returned.

    Examples:

        >>> to_bytes('abc')
        b'abc'
        >>> to_bytes('☃')
        b'\xe2\x98\x83'
    """

    return `_to_`bytes(s, encoding)
```

Then instead of calling `.decode(...)` us `to_str(...)`.  This is nice because everything remains as was on Python 2, and on Python 3 you'll get a `str` where desired.  It's unfortunate to have to specify an encoding (but it also makes sense).  This also has baked into it `errors='surrogateescape'` which basically means that even if we did guess the encoding wrong we at least preserve the correct byte sequence when round-tripping back to `bytes`.
