While I am not against these changes, I am slightly worried that, e.g., `is_unit` will not work in cases where it previously did, such as

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: 1 - sin(x)^2 - cos(x)^2
-cos(x)^2 - sin(x)^2 + 1
sage: f = 1 - sin(x)^2 - cos(x)^2
sage: f
-cos(x)^2 - sin(x)^2 + 1
sage: f.is_trivial_zero()
False
sage: bool(f == 0)
True
sage: f.is_unit()
False
```

Right, I was rushing it. In principle there could be `is_trivial_unit` like `is_trivial_zero` and a note in `is_unit` as to performance.
