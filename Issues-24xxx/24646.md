This implements #22509 for any Python packages that are installed with `sdh_pip_install`.  Passing `--root=` to pip is essentially the same as using `DESTDIR` with `make install`.

This required a few additional changes to a small handful of packages for them to work with staged installation.

I don't see how you can assert that without knowing what it is.

It's not at all obvious to me that the check *before* is equivalent to the `ln -s` succeeding. The check after is simpler and therefore safer.
