This implements #22509 for any Python packages that are installed with `sdh_pip_install`.  Passing `--root=` to pip is essentially the same as using `DESTDIR` with `make install`.

This required a few additional changes to a small handful of packages for them to work with staged installation.

I don't see how you can assert that without knowing what it is.

It's not at all obvious to me that the check *before* is equivalent to the `ln -s` succeeding. The check after is simpler and therefore safer.

> I don't see how you can assert that without knowing what it is.


I know what it is because I wrote the original. The code which is in that `spkg-postinst` script used to be in `spkg-install` but it's no longer needed because of Jupyter improvements. At some point, you must have had a merge/rebase conflict with `spkg-install` and this left-over `spkg-postinst` script is fallout from that.

Apparently I had asked Jeroen to make this a prerequisite to #24935 (after all, this ticket was opened first and had no reason to wait so long to be merged).  But he forgot about that or ignored it (and I likewise forgot about it).

That's a bit flippant.  Of course I built Sage with this ticket.  It's been opened for 6 months and has had to be rebased many times.  Perhaps there was a small merge error along the way.  But that's not as if it was never tested...
