`charpoly` of a symbolic matrix should return a symbolic polynomial?

Yes and no: this commit (and, perhaps more importantly, 84d6a1b874c) mainly reorganize the code, without changing its semantics much...

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A4):
> Maybe instead of `pol(self.pyobject())` `parent(pol)(self.pyobject())` was meant?

...But I doubt that. Wouldn't something like (not tested)

```
if pol.parent() is not SR:
    try:
        return new_Expression_from_pyobject(self._parent, pol(self.pyobject()))
    except TypeError:
        pass
zero = self._parent.zero()
return zero.add(*(pol[i]*self**i for i in xrange(pol.degree() + 1)))
```

make more sense?

> This also fixes doctests that were wrong IMHO.

While I have no strong opinion about

```
             sage: f(pi)
-            1.00000000000000*pi^2 - 2.00000000000000
-
+            7.86960440108936
```
I really don't see why you would want this:

```
             sage: SR(0.1)._evaluate_polynomial(pol)
-            0.123400000000000
+            617/5000
```

Because `pol` is a `QQ[]` and `QQ(0.1)` is `1/10` of course.

Don't misunderstand me, my comment was not a rethorical question. I'm ready to change what's returned from charpoly() to an expression.

I would not try to force this onto the user - this conversion is easy.

I also do not understand why having polynomials over `SR` makes no sense; well, it might be so in an ideal world where `SR` can seamlessly discover polynomial structures in expressions and operate accordingly, but this is not the case I think.
