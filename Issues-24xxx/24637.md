Given a polyhedral graph, there is a special realization of the associated combinatorial polyhedron, namely the Koebe polyhedron, such that all the edges are tangent to the unit sphere. The goal of this ticket is to add a method 
'koebe_polyhedron' to graphs to get this object. 

Note: typically, the coordinates are not exact, so one might think about implementations in RDF, and checks afterwards to make sure, we have actually realized the correct graph. 

Depends on #24634
