I am making an assumption, that the kernel of a sparse matrix will still generally be sparse. It will probably increase in density, but I do not think by enough in general to warrant the result being a dense matrix. On an example I tested:

```
0.000136661807580175
0.00566007653061225
```
where the top is the original density and the bottom is the density of the `right_kernel_matrix`.

1. Some doctests are failing.
2. The code itself looks good. As always, I tend to say blank after a comma (PEP8)

```diff
+                    entries[cur_row,i] = one
[...]
+                    for r,p in enumerate(pivots):
[...]

```

Summary: LGTM once the failing doctests are investigated.

Thanks for looking at this.

This takes care of the failing doctest. So my tacit understanding why simply updating the doctest is okay is because the algorithm is now better and doesn't change those entries, meaning they stay at exactly 0 rather than approximately 0.

I don't entirely agree with the comma space (same reasoning as on #27442), but I added it. I also did a few other little PEP8 and maintenance things.
