This is part of #20416. Here, we
- polish method binpacking
- add arguments `solver` and `verbose`
- enable to give a dictionary of items as input, in which case each bin contains the list of items in it. When the input is a list of weights, each bin contains the list of the weight of the items in it.

I forgot to add the parameters in internal calls.

For the solvers, you have at least `GLPK` and `PPL`. I also tried with `Cplex`.

```
sage: from sage.numerical.optimize import binpacking
sage: values = [1/5, 1/3, 2/3, 3/4, 5/7]
sage: binpacking(values, solver='GLPK')
[[1/5, 3/4], [5/7], [1/3, 2/3]]
sage: binpacking(values, solver='PPL')
[[5/7], [1/5, 3/4], [1/3, 2/3]]
sage: binpacking(values, solver='Cplex')
[[2/3, 1/3], [1/5, 5/7], [3/4]]

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A7):

> For the solvers, you have at least `GLPK` and `PPL`. I also tried with `Cplex`.

OK then. Tested, seems to be OK.

Feel free to mark this as positive review. Or if you want to make bikeshedding:

"Solves the bin packing problem." -> "Solve the bin packing problem.", see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content

After "Two version of this problem are solved by this algorithm" there is unnecessary indentation for the two-element list.
