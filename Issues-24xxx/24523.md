We change the string representation of `RealField(XXX)` from

```
Real Field with XX bits of precision
```
to

```
Real Floating-Point Field with XX bits of precision
```

The reason for this change is that "Real Field" is not precise enough. Beyond floating-point, "Real Field" could equivalently be used for fixed-point, intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "fixed-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic", see eg
     
- ​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic
- ​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic
- ​https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00432152v3/ 

This ticket is part of a the refactorization #24457 that intends to clean  computations involving the different kinds of real numbers.

The git branch was obtained by running the following command in `$SAGE_ROOT/src`

```
for file in $(grep -l "Real Field with" $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f))
  do sed -i "s/Real Field with/Real Floating-Point Field with/g" $file
done
```
Tests work fine except for doctests that involves an output with a linebreak such as

```
sage: x = polygen(RR); r = (1 + x)/(1 - x^2); r.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real
Field with 53 bits of precision
```
(from `src/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py` line 218). These can also be handled using multiline sed replacement

```
for file in $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f)
do
  sed -Ei '{N; s/Real(\s+)Field(\s+)with/Real\1Floating-Point Field\2with/; ty; P; D; :y}' $file
done
```

As part of this ticket, the printf percentage syntax has been changed to the newer Python 3 standard `format` syntax (see [comment:22](#comment%3A22)) in all real field representations.

Sorry to spoil the party, but what is wrong with "Real Field with XX bits of precision"? Doesn't the "XX bits of precision" imply already that it's floating point? I think that the shorter name `Real Field` is sufficient.

Note that also balls and intervals are floating-point, so do you plan to use `Real Floating-point Interval Field` and `Real Floating-point Ball Field` too?

The rationale is: not precise enough. The "Real Field with XX bits of precision" could equivalently be used for intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic".
