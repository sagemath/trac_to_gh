We change the string representation of `RealField(XXX)` from

```
Real Field with XX bits of precision
```
to

```
Real Floating-Point Field with XX bits of precision
```

The reason for this change is that "Real Field" is not precise enough. Beyond floating-point, "Real Field" could equivalently be used for fixed-point, intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "fixed-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic", see eg
     
- ​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic
- ​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic
- ​https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00432152v3/ 

This ticket is part of a the refactorization #24457 that intends to clean  computations involving the different kinds of real numbers.

The git branch was obtained by running the following command in `$SAGE_ROOT/src`

```
for file in $(grep -l "Real Field with" $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f))
  do sed -i "s/Real Field with/Real Floating-Point Field with/g" $file
done
```
Tests work fine except for doctests that involves an output with a linebreak such as

```
sage: x = polygen(RR); r = (1 + x)/(1 - x^2); r.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real
Field with 53 bits of precision
```
(from `src/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py` line 218). These can also be handled using multiline sed replacement

```
for file in $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f)
do
  sed -Ei '{N; s/Real(\s+)Field(\s+)with/Real\1Floating-Point Field\2with/; ty; P; D; :y}' $file
done
```

As part of this ticket, the printf percentage syntax has been changed to the newer Python 3 standard `format` syntax (see comment:22) in all real field representations.

+We change the string representation of `RealField(XXX)` from
 
+```
+Real Field with XX bits of precision

+
+```
+Real Floating-Point Field with XX bits of precision
+```
+
+The reason for this change is that "Real Field" is not precise enough. Beyond floating-point, "Real Field" could equivalently be used for fixed-point, intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "fixed-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic", see eg

+This ticket is part of a the refactorization #24457 that intends to clean  computations involving the different kinds of real numbers.
+
+The git branch was obtained by running the following command in `$SAGE_ROOT/src`
+
+```
+for file in $(grep -l "Real Field with" $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f))
+  do sed -i "s/Real Field with/Real Floating-Point Field with/g" $file
+done
+```
+Tests work fine except for doctests that involves an output with a linebreak such as
+
+```
+sage: x = polygen(RR); r = (1 + x)/(1 - x^2); r.parent()
+Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real
+Field with 53 bits of precision
+```
+(from `src/sage/tests/french_book/polynomes.py` line 218). These can also be handled using multiline sed replacement
+
+```
+for file in $(find . -name "*pyx" -o -name "*py" -o -name "*pxd" -o -name "*rst" -type f)
+do
+  sed -Ei '{N; s/Real(\s+)Field(\s+)with/Real\1Floating-Point Field\2with/; ty; P; D; :y}' $file
+done
+```
+
+As part of this ticket, the printf percentage syntax has been changed to the newer Python 3 standard `format` syntax (see comment:22) in all real field representations.
