This check in `build/bin/sage-spkg` should really depend on the *filesystem* and not on the OS:

```
                msg="$script should not be marked executable in the build/pkgs directory"
                if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
                    # On Cygwin we can't necessarily rely on file permissions
                    # being sane, so just issue a warning; on other platforms
                    # this should be enforced as an error
                    echo >&2 "WARNING: $msg"
                else
                    error_msg "$msg"
                    exit 1
                fi

I think also lots of other things will go wrong if you try to build on a VFAT filesystem.

I guess really #25207 could be considered a duplicate of this ticket, albeit a bit broader in scope.

I'm still not sure about FAT if you can't have symlinks though...
