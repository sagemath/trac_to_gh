- `Genus_enumerate` is an awkward name to me. It seems like `(global_)genera` is a better name.
- Have you thought about making your functions iterators?
- I do not see how the result could be nondeterministic. Can you explain why this could happen?
- You should also do `foo is None` instead of `foo == None`.
- You should remove the list in `all` and instead use an iterator; i.e., `all(test for x in foo)` instead of `all([test for x in foo])`.
- I am not sure it is worthwhile to test that `even` is a bool.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Dear Travis thank you for your comments.
As for the name: The function should be easy to discover.
Type Genus + auto complete and the name appears.
I am thinking of BinaryQF and BinaryQF_reduced_representatives.
But genera is a possible name. 

Guess I could make them iterators.

For one iterators are less convenient for the user. Further

<a id='comment:36'></a>Writing in the quadratic forms class

```
    from sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus import genera
```
works.
But

```
    @staticmethod
    from sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus import genera
```
crashes. Ideas?
