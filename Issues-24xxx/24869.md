```
sage: A = Zp(2)
sage: I = matrix(2,2, [A(1,10), A(0,10), A(0,10), A(1,10)])
sage: I
[1 + O(2^10)     O(2^10)]
[    O(2^10) 1 + O(2^10)]
sage: ~I
[1 + O(2^10)           0]
[          0 1 + O(2^10)]
```

The non-diagonal entries of `I^(-1)` should not be exact zeros.

We should use Smith form rather than row echelon form, since it's more stable.
