In #24658, there was a side-effect of one doctest on another doctest. The latter test was about whether a certain coercion is initially not cached, and the first test made it so that the coercion was cached before the second test started.

Proposal: Add a method `Parent._clear_coercion_caches()` that clears both `self._coerce_from_hash` and `self._convert_from_hash`.

A lot of coercion-related things are stored in the coercion model itself, not in the parent. So clearing the caches in the parent may not be sufficient.

Probably it boils down to calling `self.init_coerce(False)`, which would erase all previously cached stuff.

HOWEVER: Such a method could seriously break the coercions in Sage and thus should be used very carefully.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A1):

Yes, but one can always call `coercion_model.reset_cache()`. The difference is that there is no such  method (besides a cdef'd one) for parents to clear their caches.

I think cleaning further caches, especially `._coerce_from_list`, is not needed to fulfil its purpose, as `._coerce_from_list` is only filled by `.register_coercion()`, which is supposed to be only called during initialisation of a parent.
