I've been getting to the bottom of why tracebacks aren't displaying Cython sources on Python 3.  The problem turns out to be multi-faceted, and fixing it right would also mean fixing some things in general, since the way it works now is a hack.

Basically, the only reason it works at all on Python 2, is that the `linecache` module on Python 2 has some code which, given a relative filename (with an extension unrecognized by the import system) like `sage/rings/integer.pyx`, it will search for this file under all `sys.path` entries and, if found, read the source lines from that file.

This, in turn, only works for Sage because we actually install the `.pyx` sources in the sage package.

This does not work in Python 3.  In `linecache.updatecache`, before it tries the `sys.path` search, it checks if the module object has a `__loader__`, and calls its `get_source()` method if it exists.  On Python 2 this isn't a problem since modules don't necessarily have a `__loader__`, and in particular extension modules don't.  But on the reworked import system in Python 3, pretty much every module has a `__loader__`--in the case of extension modules an `ExtensionFileLoader`.  But the built-in `ExtensionFileLoader` of course knows nothing about Cython so its `get_source()` method just returns `None`.  `linecache.updatecache` assumes this is correct (why would the loader lie?) and returns.

The simplest way to fix this is to remove the `get_source()` method from the `ExtensionFileLoader` class. This way, Python 3 works the same way as Python 2.

Here's a Python 3 *only* rough prototype of how this might work, in this case via simply installing the `.pyx` files alongside the compiled modules.  Doing anything like inlining the source code in the compiled modules looks like it will be trickier than I thought without some modification to Cython.

This instead recognizes Cython modules by looking for `.pyx` files associated with extension modules.  It then wraps such modules with a `CythonModule` class which has a `__cython_source__` property which can read in the sources.  Unfortunately this doesn't yet handle reading sources from `.pxd` files, but that could probably be added with a bit of elbow grease.

Unfortunately, about 80% of this patch is some very general machinery that I needed just to get Python's import system to handle a new module suffix (in fact, this would even be necessary to override the handling of already known suffixes).  This used to be easier to do in Python 2--I've done it before relatively painlessly.

In the meantime my workaround is fine, but an added complication I would have wished to have avoided...

I have pretty good contacts with Cython upstream (according to github, I am the number 6 Cython contributor). So if you want to propose something, there is a good chance that it will be accepted.

From your description, it seems that the simplest solution would be to add a custom `__loader__` for Cython modules.

How does the mapping traceback -> module work?\n\nUltimately `inspect.findsource`, which is used in formatting the traceback, goes through `linecache` to get the source lines for a file.  Well, if you look at how [linecache.updatecache](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/linecache.py#L94) is implemented, it's funny--if it's passed a real filename then it will just read the source code directly out of the filename.  The filename, in this case, is coming from the traceback frame's code object.  However, as in our old friend #24097, since the Cython module's hard-coded path is a relative path, this actually fails unless you happen to be in the right directory.

Ultimately `inspect.findsource`, which is used in formatting the traceback, goes through `linecache` to get the source lines for a file.  Well, if you look at how [linecache.updatecache](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/linecache.py#L94) is implemented, it's funny--if it's passed a real filename then it will just read the source code directly out of the filename.  The filename, in this case, is coming from the traceback frame's code object.  However, as in our old friend #24097, since the Cython module's hard-coded path is a relative path, this actually fails unless you happen to be in the right directory.  It then goes on to try going through the module's `__loader__` if it has one...

In retrospect, I don't know if this will work after all.  It's the import system itself that constructs `module` objects and assigns to their `__loader__` attribute (with the loader that was used to load the module code in the first place).  So I do't know that it's possible for a module to come with `__loader__` already in its namespace and not just have it overridden.  So it might be necessary to have some import hooks after all if we wanted to provide a custom loader for Cython modules.

That said, it would still be possible to provide better introspection of Cython modules if the Cython sources were (optionally) baked into the module somewhere, and that's a separate issue and easy to add to Cython.

```

It still requires that the sources can be found in `sys.path`.

I'm not saying that this is the perfect solution, but it gives a starting point that playing with `__loader__` works. Now I'll try to implement a custom `__loader__`.

<a id='comment:24'>Comment 24:</a>
OK, new and super-simple solution which just reverts the Python 3 behaviour to the Python 2 behaviour:

```
class DeletedAttribute(object):
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        raise AttributeError


from importlib.machinery import ExtensionFileLoader
ExtensionFileLoader.get_source = DeletedAttribute()
```

It effectively removes the `get_source` attribute from `ExtensionFileLoader`. This causes the `linecache` module to continuing searching for the source file as in Python 2.

The traceback contains the source filename:

```
sage: try:
....:     1/0
....: except ZeroDivisionError as E:
....:     tb = sys.exc_info()[2]
sage: tb.tb_next.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename
'sage/rings/integer.pyx'
```

An ugly/hackish solution is still better than no solution at all.

I simply don't see a better solution, not even in theory.

I see--that's those fake Cython hacked frames with fake code objects.  I didn't realize that would include the correct filename even for functions defined in `.pxd` file but apparently it does.

> An ugly/hackish solution is still better than no solution at all.

I agree, as long as we open a new ticket--either a separate ticket from this one for the hack solution, or a new ticket for tracking the issue (I'd prefer the former since closing this ticket means closing some valuable discussion).

> I simply don't see a better solution, not even in theory.

I still have some ideas about this, but it would require modification to Cython for sure.

Additionally (and much longer term) a very large part of the problem is the Python Loader API's assumption that a module has a single source file.  It seems the assumption is that "for extension modules sure there may be many source files, but it's not useful for Python-level introspection to be able to return them".  Sure, for normal extension modules.  But the Cython case obviously disproves that in general.  I think this is worth taking up but that's not going to help anytime soon.
