The method `affine_hull` of `Polyhedron` fails.

```
sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices=([[-1, 1], [0, -1], [0, 0], [-1, -1]]))
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(vertices=[[1, 1], [1, -1], [0, -1], [0, 0]])
sage: P = P1.intersection(P2)
sage: A, b = P.affine_hull(as_affine_map=True, orthonormal=True, extend=True)
AssertionError
```

This is because the order of the vertices of P is changed by the translation by zero vector.

```
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (0, -1))
sage: P.translation(vector([0,0])).vertices()
(A vertex at (0, -1), A vertex at (0, 0))
```

1) It would be bettter to sort the V and H generators so that this kind of troubles never appear (and equality test would be even faster)

2) The `translation` method is stupidly written

```
    displacement = vector(displacement)
    new_vertices = [x.vector()+displacement for x in self.vertex_generator()]
    new_rays = self.rays()
    new_lines = self.lines()
    new_ring = self.parent()._coerce_base_ring(displacement)
    return Polyhedron(vertices=new_vertices, rays=new_rays, lines=new_lines, base_ring=new_ring)
```
we should not recompute anything!

That would require #22701 - Setting up a Polyhedron from both Vrep and Hrep.

`that we really Q really` -> `that Q really`?

Otherwise, it looks good to me and the bot is happy so I would put it as positive review once the small mistake above is corrected.

Thanks for the quick fix!
