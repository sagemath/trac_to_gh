Every poset has at least one *greedy* linear extension with optimal number of jumps. Use this to make a faster function.

Added that.

Recursion depth can not be a problem here; we can propably never compute jump number of 100-element posets, unless it has very small width (and if so, we should optimize by doing series-parallel decomposition). But yes, it would be faster not to use recursion.

Returning a result is not enought if we want to cut the computation based on earlier result.
