(From an [Ask Sage question by Jacques Saliba](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40369/what-is-a-pari-group/) and the answer by Vincent Delecroix.)

The [PARI groups page of the Sage documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/pari_group.html) has examples which output a PARI group.

A link to the [PARI/GP documentation for polgalois](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/General_number_fields.html#polgalois)
would help make more sense of such output.

The previous
[request for making it easier to extract information about a Galois group](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/xEXdPgg2kfM/discussion), posted by John Cremona on sage-devel and other lists on 2017-10-15 is the object of #24469.


Keywords: **doc, PARI group**
