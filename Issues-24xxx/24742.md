Constructing matrices is a mess currently. There is a lot of code duplication between

A. The global `matrix()` constructor

B. `MatrixSpace.__call__`

C. The various `Matrix.__init__` methods

Since a lot of parameters are involved (matrix space, matrix size, entries, ring, sparseness, implementation), I decided to create a new class `MatrixArgs` just for dealing with inputting matrices. This also makes matrices more consistent: because the same code is used everywhere, constructing matrices should now behave the same independently of the implementation (base ring, sparseness).

These are the changes in this branch:

1. A completely new module `sage.matrix.args`. This module concentrates in one place everything which was scattered in various places before. I tried to reproduce the existing functionality, except where it didn't make sense. I took care to be efficient where efficiency matters, for example by avoiding copies.

2. Enormous simplifications to A, B and C above, typically replacing them with just a few lines of code. In a few cases where the original code was particularly ugly, I mostly left the ugly code in place to be fixed later.

3. Various minor changes here and there. Note that most of these were separated in dependent tickets, but a few are left for this ticket.

This fixes: #8277, #10613, #12778, #20211, #19134, #25076

Follow-up tickets: #23719, #25061

Very nice work! Though I honestly don't understand the new code in detail, it looks reasonable and I trust the tests more than my own judgment to check that it does the right thing. Even if there are small issues, I think it can only be an improvement compared to what we had before.

I have one significant concern with this ticket though: several simple cases of `matrix(...)` apparently became a lot slower. Compare in particular:

Sage 8.1:

```
sage: %timeit matrix(ZZ,3,3)[0,0] = 1 # used to be a fast way to construct a new mutable matrix
The slowest run took 62.41 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 7 µs per loop
sage: c = vector(ZZ, [1,2,3])
sage: %timeit matrix([c])
The slowest run took 4.77 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 33.7 µs per loop
```
This ticket:

```
sage: %timeit matrix(ZZ,3,3)[0,0] = 1
10000 loops, best of 3: 110 µs per loop
sage: c = vector(ZZ, [1,2,3])
sage: %timeit matrix([c])
10000 loops, best of 3: 101 µs per loop
```

Some nitpicking while I'm at it: it is perhaps not ideal that

```
sage: matrix(1,1,[[1,2]])
ValueError: inconsistent number of columns: should be 1 but got 2
```
and

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,1,1,[[1,2]])
ValueError: sequence too long (expected length 1, got more)
```
yield different errors.

<div id="comment:56" align="right">comment:56</div>

There is something very strange going on with the timings:

With this ticket, constructing a matrix and storing it is an order of magnitude faster than constructing a matrix and *not* storing it:

```
sage: timeit('matrix(3, 3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 117 µs per loop
sage: timeit('a=matrix(3, 3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 10.7 µs per loop
```
It doesn't matter if the storing happens inside the `timeit()` or not:

```
sage: M = matrix(3,3)
sage: timeit('matrix(3, 3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 10.5 µs per loop
sage: del M
sage: timeit('matrix(3, 3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 115 µs per loop
```
There must be some caching issue here...

The current behaviour (without #24742) does not have this.

When a previous matrix is "cached", the timings with this ticket are actually better than before.

**Before** (8.2.beta8):

```
sage: M = matrix(ZZ,3,3)
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ,3,3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 13.2 µs per loop
```

```
sage: c = vector(ZZ, [1,2,3]); matrix([c])
[1 2 3]
sage: timeit('matrix([c])', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 46.3 µs per loop
```

**After** (#24742):

```
sage: M = matrix(ZZ,3,3)
sage: timeit('matrix(ZZ,3,3)', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 10.7 µs per loop
```

```
sage: c = vector(ZZ, [1,2,3]); matrix([c])
[1 2 3]
sage: timeit('matrix([c])', repeat=5, number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 5: 14.5 µs per loop
```

Not ideal, but it's not clear what the best solution is. The problem is that I'm using different code paths for the case where everything (base ring + matrix dimensions) is known and for when it's not known. In order to determine the base ring, I have to iterate over the entries anyway. It's there that the error "inconsistent number of columns" is raised.
