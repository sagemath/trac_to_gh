This ticket performs a full reimplementation of the functions
- `sage.manifolds.utilities.simplify_sqrt_real` 
- `sage.manifolds.utilities.simplify_abs_trig`
which are involved in calculus on manifolds (see [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/utilities.html#sage.manifolds.utilities.simplify_chain_real)). Instead of manipulating string representations of symbolic expressions, as previously, this ticket is based on direct manipulations of the expression tree, via the introduction of two subclasses of [ExpressionTreeWalker](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.html#sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.ExpressionTreeWalker).

Regarding the functionalities, the code in this ticket leads to the same improvements as those described in #24199, which was based on string manipulations.

Quick comment, these methods are unnecessary as `__init__` will be naturally inherited and so, this would help keep possible bugs out:

```python
    def __init__(self, ex):
        r"""
        Construct a SimplifySqrtReal object.

        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import SimplifySqrtReal
            sage: s = SimplifySqrtReal(1+sqrt((x+1)^2))
            sage: type(s)
            <class 'sage.manifolds.utilities.SimplifySqrtReal'>

        """
        ExpressionTreeWalker.__init__(self, ex)
```
Moreover, the test does not feel so useful, so I would just delete the whole thing.

Thank you for pointing this. You are of course perfectly right! The above commit suppresses the `__init__`'s.

Even better would be to set a flag when you change something and loop as long as the flag is set. If you define the walker class inside the function that calls it you don't even need to make the flag global.

Well, showing up in a ticket less than 24 h after its creation is not what I would call late ;-)
Thank you for your feedback!

If I understand correctly (which is not guaranteed...), this would change the ordering of simplification. Take for instance the expression

```
ex = sqrt(a + sqrt(b))
```

Thanks for your answer. However, I am afraid I still don't understand; when you suggest to not call the walker from within the walker, this amounts to suppress these lines:

```
                if 'sqrt(' in str(argum):

```
correct?
Then in the example of [comment:8](#comment%3A8), how are we going to reach first `sqrt(b)`? To be depth-first, it seems to me that some recursion is required, as in the above  `self(argum)`.

No, it does not seem to be the case, because of the `return simpl` in line 190 of https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/manifolds/utilities.py?id=0c7b9ea177eeb653de9a2987ea60920acaa96d88

Consider for instance the following example; with the current version, we have

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import SimplifySqrtReal
sage: SimplifySqrtReal(sqrt(1 + sqrt(x^2)))()
sqrt(abs(x) + 1)
```
which is correct, given we have no sign assumption on `x`. Now, if we replace `argum = self(argum)` in line 170 of the above file by `pass`, we get

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import SimplifySqrtReal
sage: SimplifySqrtReal(sqrt(1 + sqrt(x^2)))()
sqrt(x + 1)
```
which is a wrong result; it shows that only the outermost `sqrt` has been treated, by passing its argument (i.e. `1 + sqrt(x^2)`) to `radcan`, which has oversimplified it to `x + 1`. Even if we call the walker in a loop until no change happens, there is no way that the `x + 1` get transformed to `abs(x) + 1`. Am I missing something?

First, it was nonsense from me to say the walker should not call itself. I forgot that this is done all the time by walkers. Also I naively gave you a solution idea from a different case. Then my dislike just boils down to the usage of `str()`. The first usage could be replaced with `...has(sqrt(w0)) or ... has(1/sqrt(w0))` with `w0=SR.wild()`.

I'm sorry that my directions were so completely off this time and that I also forgot to tell about GiNaC/Pynac pattern matching, which of course is faster than any Python solution because expressions are wrapped C++ objects.

Builds and tests cleanly atop 8.1.rc0 on an OpenSUSE 42.2 system.
So far, randomly selected worksheets complete successfully and correctly.

My only residual concern is that from an architectural perspective, these corrections and optimizations reflect less than adequate functionality in the main Sage simplification chain. Logically, it appears the changes should go live there, but practically, they must remain inside manifolds/utilities.py. 

I should add that the code is now easy to comprehend.
