1. Cleanup some `**kwds` passing instead of explicitly listing some random subset of arguments to `cython()`.

2. Remove the `import_test` function. Instead, move the tests to doctests.

3. Make sure that all opened files are explicitly closed (typically using a `with` block).

4. In `cython_import`, restore `sys.path` after changing it.

5. Deprecate `cython_create_local_so` which is just calling `cython()` with specific keyword arguments.

6. Use the `.pyx` extension for all temporary files.

7. Use the `restore_cwd` context.
