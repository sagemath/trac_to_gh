This does three little things to better support `long`-related functionality, especially in the doctests.  This allows a lot of tests to pass on Python 3 that wouldn't otherwise, or would need to be skipped and/or have Python 3 specific copies:

* The Sage preparser supports Python 2 style long literals, like `42L`.  These are just treated as normal ints on Python 3 (we could also consider adding a deprecation warning for this usage).  I actually wish Python itself had done this (just as they restored backwards-compat for `u''` literals--that they didn't I think is just that explicit `long`s is relatively uncommon.

* The *doctest* parser has a fixup for recognizing long literals in the expected output of a test, and treating them as normal ints on Python 3.  This is probably the weakest part of the patch in terms of implementation--it's very na√Øve and I can imagine the possibility of false positives, though it is still pretty unlikely.  Open to better ideas on this.

* In `sage.all` I added, on Python 3 only, a new global called `long` which is just a function that wraps `int()` and (except in the tests, for now) raises a `DeprecationWarning` for using `long()`.  This still allows a lot of tests to work.  I deliberately made it a simple function, and not a class, as the latter would tempt too many errors with code like `isinstance(x, long)`.

This was added very deliberately in part to help with porting the doctests, so as to allow the great many doctests that use `long()` to continue working for now without interruption (while at the same time giving a useful warning for user code).

My intention, though not explicitly stated, was to later (once we want to switch Sage to Python 3) remove the condition so that it's easy to find and fix/remove such tests later.

I think it's better to just enable the alias now without any deprecation and then later add an unconditional deprecation. Since Sage doesn't really support Python 3 for the moment, the deprecation won't have much effect anyway.

Then it should be the same in doctests too. I'm fine with a deprecation or no deprecation either way, but I am protesting the condition on `DOCTEST_MODE`.

According to the [Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute), Sphinx autodoc also supports the special comment syntax `#:` for this. And in fact, Sphinx itself uses that syntax.

You may think that there is no harm in using strings-which-are-not-docstrings like that, but the problem is that it teaches a bad habit. In particular the following does **not** contain a doctest despite looking like it does:

```
class X(object):
    attr = "something"
    """
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: 1 + 1
        3
    """
