This does three little things to better support `long`-related functionality, especially in the doctests.  This allows a lot of tests to pass on Python 3 that wouldn't otherwise, or would need to be skipped and/or have Python 3 specific copies:

* The Sage preparser supports Python 2 style long literals, like `42L`.  These are just treated as normal ints on Python 3 (we could also consider adding a deprecation warning for this usage).  I actually wish Python itself had done this (just as they restored backwards-compat for `u''` literals--that they didn't I think is just that explicit `long`s is relatively uncommon.

* The *doctest* parser has a fixup for recognizing long literals in the expected output of a test, and treating them as normal ints on Python 3.  This is probably the weakest part of the patch in terms of implementation--it's very na√Øve and I can imagine the possibility of false positives, though it is still pretty unlikely.  Open to better ideas on this.

* In `sage.all` I added, on Python 3 only, a new global called `long` which is just a function that wraps `int()` and (except in the tests, for now) raises a `DeprecationWarning` for using `long()`.  This still allows a lot of tests to work.  I deliberately made it a simple function, and not a class, as the latter would tempt too many errors with code like `isinstance(x, long)`.

This was added very deliberately in part to help with porting the doctests, so as to allow the great many doctests that use `long()` to continue working for now without interruption (while at the same time giving a useful warning for user code).

My intention, though not explicitly stated, was to later (once we want to switch Sage to Python 3) remove the condition so that it's easy to find and fix/remove such tests later.

So maybe adding this helper isn't that useful anyways.

So what if we only injected it into the globals when running the doctests, just temporarily, no deprecation warning or anything.  Later, when we want to start moving the tests to be more Python 3-compatible, we just remove it and get NameErrors everywhere the tests try to use it.

Replying to [@embray](#comment:11):
> Thanks--though what do you think about my other proposal of just injecting `long` for the purpose of the doctests *only*?  I'm personally leaning toward it as a preference.

Go for it.

This depends on #24343, but the new approach to handling `long(...)` can be see in the latest commit.

Now, instead of providing a user-visible replacement for `long` (which as I've already remarked is probably not that useful anyways, or at least a slippery-slope to providing other replacements for old Python 2 builtins), it just injects it into the globals for doctests.  This should be seen purely as a transitional measure.

Jeroen, I see you rebased this, but does that constitute a "review"?

IIRC, the only open question on this ticket had to do with my plan for aliasing `long` in Python 3.  Originally I was adding an alias in the global namespace for all users (that would raise a deprecation warning).  But now I've gone back on that, and am only injecting `long` as an alias for `int` into the globals for doctests.

My experience with testing this, so far, has been that it allows a lot of tests to pass on Python 3 that wouldn't otherwise, with few exceptions, and that it's a decent transitional approach.

The `extra_globals` dict I added could prove useful for a few other things too.

I don't like this syntax:

    In particular, on Python 3 add ``long`` as an alias for ``int`` so that

Replying to [@embray](#comment:25):
> That's standard syntax in Sphinx for documenting class attributes.

According to the [Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute), Sphinx autodoc also supports the special comment syntax `#:` for this. And in fact, Sphinx itself uses that syntax.

You may think that there is no harm in using strings-which-are-not-docstrings like that, but the problem is that it teaches a bad habit. In particular the following does **not** contain a doctest despite looking like it does:

```
class X(object):
    attr = "something"
    """
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: 1 + 1
        3
