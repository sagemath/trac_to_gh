Welcome to Sagemath

I have some comments to help you improving the code.

- unify `nonedges_only` and `nonedgesonly`. Actually, #24094 uses `nonedgesonly`. I don't know which is best, but should be the same.
- `Returns the Katz matrix of G with parameter alpha.` -> `Return the Katz matrix of the graph with parameter alpha.`
- only 1 empty line is needed after `INPUT::`
- <code>`True`</code> -> <code>``True``</code>
- `if true, eliminates common neighbors between adjacent vertices`. Could you add that the value for each edge is set to 0 ?
- `the Katz matrix of the graph self with parameter alpha` -> `the Katz matrix of the graph  with parameter alpha`
- `G1 = Graph({1:[2,3], 2:[1,4], 3:[1,4], 4:[2,3]})` -> `G1 = graphs.CycleGraph(4)` ?
- since you don't have `G2`, you could rename `G1` to `G`
- add a space between `*` and the text in <code>*:meth:`~katz_centrality`</code> and the line after
- add an empty line after `TESTS::`
- The examples you give in the `TESTS` could be in the examples section. In a TESTS block, we expect examples raising errors, with the empty graph, etc.
- the test `alpha <= 0` should be made before any other computation
- `if nonedges_only == True:` -> `if nonedges_only:`

in method `def katz_centrality(self, alpha):`
- you could add an optional parameter `u` to return the centrality of a specified vertex. For that, add `u=None` and then the return statement becomes something like `if u is None: return K else: return K[u]`
- you must indent the text in 80 columns mode. Some code editors are really helpful to do that without effort
- You return a list. Wouldn't it be better to return a dictionary keyed by vertices ? How to know which value corresponds to a node ?

I would like to work on it.
Should I work on existing branch or should I create a new one based on latest sage develop version?

<a id='comment:10'></a>
Several issues (I'm skipping the coding style issues for the moment, but please have a look at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html and check how other methods are written).

In method `katz_matrix`:
- add some explanation of what is a Katz matrix
- please add parameter `vertices` similarly to method `.adjacency_matrix()`. This is important as in the future we will no longer ensure that the list of vertices is sorted (due to Python 3).

In method `katz_centrality`
- add some explanation of what is the Katz centrality, plus a link to relevant wikipedia page
- in the code, choose an order like `verts = list(self)`, and pass it to `katz_matrix`. Here we don't need the list of vertices to be sorted, we just want to know the ordering, so we fix it.
- `u not in self.vertices()` -> `u not in self`
- You can simplify the construction of the dictionary

```diff
-        for i in range(n):
-            Kdict[vert[i]] = katz_values[0][i]
+        Kdict = {u: katz_values[0][i] for i, u in enumerate(verts)}
```
- Do we really need to build dictionary `Kdict` when `u` is not None ?

Do not forget to check that all tests pass and that the documentation builds properly and displays nicely.

Thanks for the prompt reply and suggesting the changes.
Done all the improvements mentioned above and also made sure to pass all the tests.
I have done the changes as per required by the documentation in generic_graph.py file. But could not figure out how to view those changes as they will actually be looking in documentation. And is 
there any test command for checking if format is correct for documentation.

See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html

You can rebuild the full documentation using

```
sage -b && sage --docbuild reference html
```
or rebuild only the documentation of the graph module

```
sage -b && sage --docbuild reference/graphs html
```

Then, you can look at the documentation with your web browser.

```
file://PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html
```

For the coding style, please try to comply to https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008

- You must ensure that all comments are formatted in 80 columns mode. Some code editors can be configured to ease this task

- minor stylistic issue

```diff
-        - ``nonedgesonly`` -- Boolean (default: ``True``); if True, value for each
-          edge present in the graph is set to zero.
+        - ``nonedgesonly`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, value for each
+          edge present in the graph is set to zero
```

- you can use `for u in self` or `set(self)` or `if u in self`, etc.

```diff
-              set(vertices) != set(self.vertex_iterator())):
+              set(vertices) != set(self)):
```

- pep8

```diff
-        K =  (In - alpha * A.transpose()).inverse()-In
+        K =  (In - alpha * A.transpose()).inverse() - In
```
 

 ```diff
 -            Missing = onesmat - A- In
 +            Missing = onesmat - A - In

Please check carefully your code, that comments are in 80 columns mode, if possible that you follow the PEP8 coding style, that the comments are sufficient and helpful to the user, and that your code is best possible.

for instance, you have apparently not double check this part:

```diff

-            idx = verts.index(u)
-            return katz_values[0][idx]
-

-        Kdict = {u: katz_values[0][i] for i, u in enumerate(verts)}
-
-        if u is None:
-            return Kdict
-        else :
-            return Kdict[u]
+        if u:
+            return katz_values[0][verts.index(u)]

This is much better now. We certainly same some computation time (but see point below). For the space complexity, it remains in `O(n^2)` as we compute the Katz matrix in all cases.

- The test `if u and u not in self:` must be done before computing `verts = list(self)` and more importantly the computation of the Katz matrix.

I have now more algorithmic questions (more interesting than coding style :P):

- What is the expected answer when the graph is not connected ? May be we can save computation time if the answer is always 0 for vertices in different components ?

- Same question for strongly connected digraphs? In the example, vertices 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 have no in-neighbors and vertex 4 has no out-neighbor. When you will get an answer, you should document the example explaining why some values are 0.

- When graph is not connected answer for a particular vertex is only dependent on the vertices in its connected component only and not in the other component. So yes we really can do optimize here. Will work on that.


*Same question for strongly connected digraphs? In the example, vertices 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 have no in-neighbors and vertex 4 has no out-neighbor. When you will get an answer, you should document the example explaining why some values are 0.* 


- for strongly connected Digraph the answer will be non zero for every node. Also for any node with in-neighbors 0 the answer will be 0 as its the very essence of katz centrality to measure influence of an actor(node here) in a social network.

Please double check your code and test it ! it contains obvious errors.

You can write directly `for g in self.connected_components_subgraphs()`

Add a doctest with a non connected graph, e.g., `graphs.PathGraph(3) + graphs.PathGraph(4)`.
