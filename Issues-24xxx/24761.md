This type needs to have an explicit `__hash__` implementation for Python 3.

Although its underlying data structure is a mutable `dict`, it's not intended to be mutated and the API generally disallows this (it still might be better if it used an immutable dict).

Interesting--I'd have just assumed they would optimize that, but I guess technically you can't since many objects' `.__class__` can be overridden.  We're certainly not concerned with that here.

Cython really wants to be Python-compatible. `type()` is a built-in function, so Cython knows exactly what it does. But `.__class__` is just an attribute that a custom (meta?)class can override.\n\nThis also explains why you shouldn't do `from six.moves import range` in Cython code: instead of a known builtin, you get a random Python object that Cython cannot do anything with.",

Indeed. Cython really wants to be Python-compatible. `type()` is a built-in function, so Cython knows exactly what it does. But `.__class__` is just an attribute that a custom (meta?)class can override.

This also explains why you shouldn't do `from six.moves import range` in Cython code: instead of a known builtin, you get a random Python object that Cython cannot do anything with.
