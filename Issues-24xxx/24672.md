As a "reboot" of the `SAGE64` mess, let us add `--enable-bits=32` and `--enable-bits=64` options for `configure`. To simplify the build system, this will force building GCC if the bitness does not equal the default produced by GCC.

Depends on #23733

I don't see how this is related to clang support.

Anyway, I'm trying to add a feature. I'm doing that in the way that seems easiest to me, which involves installing GCC. Nobody is forcing you to use this feature. And if you want to improve the implementation of this feature, you are more than welcome to improve it on a follow-up ticket.
