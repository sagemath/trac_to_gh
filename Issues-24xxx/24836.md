Various cleanup and minor fixes to `sage.interfaces.sage0`.

The most significant issue here is again handling file opening/closing in such a way that we don't get `ResourceWarning`s in the tests.

I found the best way to do this was to ensure that when the remote sage loads a pickle it does so wrapped in a `with open(...):` block, but doing this required adding the ability to process multi-line statements.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Two minor comments

1. Instead of

```
+        elif isinstance(init_code, list):
+            init_code = list(init_code)
```
  I would rather use a `else` or adding a `else` that raises a `TypeError`.

2. Do you mind changing `(b">>> ")` to `b'>>>'` for consistency?
