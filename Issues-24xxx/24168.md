<a id='comment:1'></a>Beside manpower, is there any technical issue holding us from upgrading our package?

A small piece of motivation: binder (http://mybinder.org) requires jupyter 5.*; so if we upgrade, our docker image will be directly binder ready; currently in https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/blob/master/Dockerfile, I force a Jupyter upgrade.

Of course jupyter doesn't make it easy for you to figure the version of it components and what goes with what.

I am on it. I'll use the latest version suggested by pip; pip now knows not to suggest versions that are not compatible with Python's version.

Hopefuly no other dependency than jupyter_core needs to be updated!

That was unrelated: I had an old kernelspec from Sage's debian package
which was taking precedence and getting confused because in the mean
time I had uninstalled this package.

Thus I guess it's a needs review.

I am not sure though what's the right way to test this?
