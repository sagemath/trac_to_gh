Beside manpower, is there any technical issue holding us from upgrading our package?

A small piece of motivation: binder (http://mybinder.org) requires jupyter 5.*; so if we upgrade, our docker image will be directly binder ready; currently in https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/blob/master/Dockerfile, I force a Jupyter upgrade.

I think there is some confusion here. `jupyter --version` returns the version of `jupyter_core` which has a 4.4.0 release in the last 6 days.[https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/releases](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/releases)

Then there is the notebook, which is what you looked at with the pip command, the last release of that is indeed 5.2.1 [https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases) from 3 days ago. sage is at 4.4.1 (sage-on-gentoo is at 5.0.0) so yes we could upgrade that.

Of course jupyter doesn't make it easy for you to figure the version of it components and what goes with what.

ipython-6 is python3 only. However it looks like looks ipython-5 still gets regular releases for python 2.7.

Thanks François for the clarification.

I am on it. I'll use the latest version suggested by pip; pip now knows not to suggest versions that are not compatible with Python's version.

Hopefuly no other dependency than jupyter_core needs to be updated!

That was unrelated: I had an old kernelspec from Sage's debian package
which was taking precedence and getting confused because in the mean
time I had uninstalled this package.

Thus I guess it's a needs review.

I am not sure though what's the right way to test this?
