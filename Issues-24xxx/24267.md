The code does some strange things, like checking whether a variable name equals `"a"`. If it does, it tries to raise a string to an integer power.

This code was introduced in #7927.

In all doctests, the variable name is indeed `"a"` so we just cleanup the code with that assumption.

The old code didn't do that either, although it gave that impression. `x` is the string(!) `"a"`, so the code tried to add `O("a" ** prec)` which obviously failed.

I am just replacing that by the `except:` branch.
