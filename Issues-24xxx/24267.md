The code does some strange things, like checking whether a variable name equals `"a"`. If it does, it tries to raise a string to an integer power.

This code was introduced in #7927.

In all doctests, the variable name is indeed `"a"` so we just cleanup the code with that assumption.

Before returning `z`, you no longer adjust the precision.  Shouldn't you still add `O(x^prec)`?

Replying to [roed](#comment%3A7):
> Before returning `z`, you no longer adjust the precision.


The old code didn't do that either, although it gave that impression. `x` is the string(!) `"a"`, so the code tried to add `O("a" ** prec)` which obviously failed.

I am just replacing that by the `except:` branch.

That being said, if you want to improve the code in a way which doesn't involve arithmetic with strings and which still passes doctests, that is fine for me.
