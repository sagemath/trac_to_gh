As seen by

```
g = graphs.StarGraph(3)
print(g.hamiltonian_path())
print(g.hamiltonian_cycle())
```

there is a difference in function behaviour. Unify them. First wait few days and see if there is discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/56sS2HnsOIg

We need to do the deprecation thing, as we are changing the behaviour of a documented method.

I would like to have fewer WARNINGs in Sage. Can someone fix `find_hamiltonian` at `generic_graph_pyx.pyx`?

Whole interface is confusing. Why not `is_hamiltonian(certificate=True)` and a `longest_path(algorithm='randomized')` or something like that?

And how can we make the deprecation?

For deprecation, you can do as in #18375.

For the case `return "What-to-do-here???"`, I would say return `None`.
Actually, this test should be at the beginning of the method as a graph with a vertex of degree 1 is not hamiltonian.

Yes, but see what `graphs.PetersenGraph().hamiltonian_cycle(algorithm='backtrack')` currently does.

IMO it would be logical to never output a longest path for non-Hamiltonian cycle. I opened a discussion about this on sage-devel.
