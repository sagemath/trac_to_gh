This has a few small changes, most of which were difficult to separate from each other:

* Use `subprocess.Popen` instead of `os.popen`
* Don't set `os.environ['TMPDIR']` globally--by using `subprocess.Popen` we
  can update the environment just for the subprocess
* str/bytes fixes for Python 3

Previously this was also reusing the same tmpdir for all `qsieve` calls, but there does not appear to be any actual reason to do that since it appears to clean up all the files in its temp dir between runs anyways.
