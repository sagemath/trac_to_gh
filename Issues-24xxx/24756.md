Just a question: do you build R on Cygwin? I ask because R needs PCRE and a broken PCRE might yield a broken R. This is how we found out about the PCRE issues on Solaris.

Or maybe only specific parts of PCRE are broken that are not used by R on Cygwin.

On Solaris, even the *build* of R fails with the broken PCRE. So it seems that the Cygwin problem is not that severe.

The only thing that I'm missing in this branch is a comment saying that we don't run the testsuite on Cygwin because it fails always in a way which doesn't seem to affect other packages. positive review if you add that.
