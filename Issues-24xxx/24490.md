Powering a `QQbar` number by a `QQbar` number makes no sense mathematically. It goes against the philosophy of the coercion model. `QQbar` should only support powering by `QQ`. See also #5574.

This ticket is meant to revert #22120 which allows `QQbar(1) ^ QQbar(anything)`.

Depends on #5574

It does indeed make mathematical sense for all subrings of `CC`. However, if you do that, the answer should lie in `SR` and not in `QQbar`. However, I don't think it would be very useful since `SR` doesn't really understand elements of `QQbar`:

```
sage: a = QQbar(1); b = QQbar(2).sqrt(); exp(b * log(a))
e^(1.414213562373095?*log(1))
```

IIRC, the change in #22120 was motivated by the necessity of performing the operation in the asymptotic ring documented in that doctest there.

So if you want to revert this operation in QQbar, a deprecation is required IMHO and the asymptotic ring must be fixed to have the special case of a coefficient 1 such that the doctest there still works.

Some code accompanying a paper relying on that behaviour will be broken otherwise.
