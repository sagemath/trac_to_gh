<a id='comment:2'></a>There was a change in a recent beta to use clang instead of gcc when available. As a result, I have machines which used to build gcc, and indeed in which `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc` exists, but which now use clang according to Sage's configure:

```
configure:8250: result:     gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
```
So should you check whether `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc` exists, or should you check whether gcc is going to be installed?
