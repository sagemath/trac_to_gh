There was a change in a recent beta to use clang instead of gcc when available. As a result, I have machines which used to build gcc, and indeed in which `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc` exists, but which now use clang according to Sage's configure:

```
configure:8250: result:     gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
```
So should you check whether `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc` exists, or should you check whether gcc is going to be installed?

That leading space was actually needed in the old code, but it's superfluous (albeit harmless, as you say) in the new code.
