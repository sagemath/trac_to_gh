I would not be surprised if some things are broken now. There are a lot of subtle changes in networkx and not all code paths are doctested I believe.

Some more comments for potential reviewers:
* I simplified the SPKG.txt as the changelog has not been mantained for a few years it seems. Also, I am not sure whether the dependencies section is actually useful; numpy and scipy are not hard dependencies. Furthermore, I did not drop src/doc/data as mentioned in the SPKG.txt as I do not see why we should remove that from the source package.
* I upgraded copyright headers. When there were no copyright headers at all, I added new ones and seeded them with everyone in the git history of the file. The lists of authors are really lengthy but a lot of people have made little changes to these files.
* I dropped NetworkXGraphBackend as it is not used anywhere. There might still be some pickles around that use this? If so, then we should try to upgrade them on unpickling.
* The recursive topsort has disappeared it seems.
* The balanced tree implementation now raises errors if you feed it invalid heights or degrees.

It is totally not kosher to just drop functionality like NetworkXGraphBackend. Why,
what's wrong with it?
That it is not used in the Sage library does not mean it is not used by users.

And even if you did that it would require a deprecation rather than outright removal...

Ok. I don't really mind (except for recomputing the checksums.) I just thought renaming is nice because the archive was named `NetworkX-NetworkX-2.1.tar.gz` or something like that. I also wouldn't mind to use this weird name instead. Is there some reason to prefer pypi over github?

There is something wrong with this patch. It is about upgrading NetworkX to version 2.1 (clearly needed), but it also includes modifications to various parts of the code: modifying copyright descriptions in some files (`digraph.py`, `bipartite_graph.py`, `degree_sequence.py`, etc.), droping implicit assumption about vertex ordering, removing an input parameter in `cliques_get_max_clique_graph`, etc. Why ?

If you want to correct an error like in you last commit [9553d85](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/9553d85e804047b65ce218645563b2140c2d0b0c), you can open a specific ticket.

The proposed modification of copyright in `digraph.py` is really nice and I don't know how you get the data, but it should not be done here.
