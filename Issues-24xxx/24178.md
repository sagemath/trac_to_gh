```
Of many functions there are two versions with the same name---in `sage/arith` and in `sage/functions`, examples are `binomial` and `factorial`. On startup the latter versions overwrite the former because of order of import. That creates problems both with documentation, different interface, and different behavior expected. For example in #14723 the problem of `binomial(Qp(5)(8),2)` could not be resolved with the `sage/functions` version (because there the arguments have restrictions), although the `sage/arith` version would have worked perfectly. OTOH the arith version can not handle `binomial(x,y)` but the symbolic function version can.

The logical solution would be for all cases to
- make the arith version the default by removing the import in `sage/functions/all.py`; the arith version will no longer be overwritten
- dispatch calls to the arith version with symbolic arguments to the symbolic function version
- copy some symbolic documentation to arith because that docstring will be shown now 

The issues #22314, #17489 depend on this.

Alternatively, if NOT everything coerces into SR then the symbolic `binomial` interface is more restricted than the arith `binomial` interface, and thus the arith version should be default, calling the symbolic version.

This should resolve #17489 and #22314 in one go.

Doctests pass in arith and all the  symbolics and function directories but let's see.

Remaining issues like merging of documentation and deprecation of the obscure `binomial._binomial_sym`, `binomial._eval_`, `binomial._evalf_` is stuff for other tickets.

Please review.

Please don't do this. The point of having the functions the way they are in `arith` is because it is fast. Having each time an extra import, try/except, etc is a pain.

Nothing wrong with a fast arithmetic function version taking integer arguments, for special needs (and that's why they needed to be imported for some time now). Note that `arith.misc.binomial` does a lot of dispatching attempts and parent queries that do not match what you just argued.

Because the global entry functions in `functions.other` restrict the argument type, an unrestricted version is needed. Like as in `log` this can be put right next to the function class as a Python function. This would then carry a documentation overview.
