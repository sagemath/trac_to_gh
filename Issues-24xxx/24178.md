Of many functions there are two versions with the same name---in `sage/arith` and in `sage/functions`, examples are `binomial` and `factorial`. On startup the latter versions overwrite the former because of order of import. That creates problems both with documentation, different interface, and different behavior expected. For example in #14723 the problem of `binomial(Qp(5)(8),2)` could not be resolved with the `sage/functions` version (because there the arguments have restrictions), although the `sage/arith` version would have worked perfectly. OTOH the arith version can not handle `binomial(x,y)` but the symbolic function version can.

The logical solution would be for all cases to
- make the arith version the default by removing the import in `sage/functions/all.py`; the arith version will no longer be overwritten
- dispatch calls to the arith version with symbolic arguments to the symbolic function version
- copy some symbolic documentation to arith because that docstring will be shown now 

The issues #22314, #17489 depend on this.

<a id='comment:12'></a>This should resolve #17489 and #22314 in one go.

Doctests pass in arith and all the  symbolics and function directories but let's see.

Remaining issues like merging of documentation and deprecation of the obscure `binomial._binomial_sym`, `binomial._eval_`, `binomial._evalf_` is stuff for other tickets.

Please review.
