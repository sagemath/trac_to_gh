The reasons are the same as usual (getting help on r-help almost requires an up-to-date interpreter.

First attempt :
* installed the upstream tarball un `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream` ;
* updated version numbers and checksums :
* rebased patches along [the lines](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#how-to-maintain-a-set-of-patches) of the Developer's guide.

The resulting R :
* passes ptestlong with no error whatsoever ;
* sort-of passes its own test suite (i. e. a couple of expected, pre-announced, failures)

Patch rebasing : I followed the [suggestions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#how-to-maintain-a-set-of-patches) of the Developer's guide, but for each original patch individually, and manually merged the original patch's initial comment in the new patch.

I still have doubts about the legitimacy of `libcurl_https_support.patch`, which lift's R enforcement of https support. I am aware that Jeroen was sanguine about not enforcing the use of `openssl`, but do not know if he maintains this position in view of the recent (ongoing ?) [sort:relevance/sage-devel/3aifUzpfKOw/yGjBhL6iCAAJ change of license](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/openssl). Furthermore, I think that switching as much as possible to authenticated Web sources is a Good Idea (TM), and that this move is almost irresistible ; I still don't like to fight the weather...

A usual, I think that this should be checked on out problem children of platforms :
* Macintosh,
* Windows on Cygwin (at least 64 bits).

Hence the `Cc` to Dimitri (who is, AFAICT, the most knowledgeable Sage developer about Macs and their shenanigans) and Erik (whose heroic port to Cygwin is a major boon to Sage).

works on OSX (10.12), and on FreeBSD. (Disclaimer --- I don't use OSX for work since many years already, I just still have an old and slow `MacBook Air` on which I can test things).

As OSX support on 10.12 is currently dependent on open tickets, this is a test done with clang as the main C compiler, using #12426, 
and gfortran built using #23898.
