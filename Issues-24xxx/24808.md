sage: I
Twosided Ideal (-1 + x^2, y^2, x*y + y*x) of Free Algebra on 2 generators (x, y) over Algebraic Field
sage: H = A.quotient(I)
sage: H
Quotient of Free Algebra on 2 generators (x, y) over Algebraic Field by the ideal (-1 + x^2, y^2, x*y + y*x)

<a id='comment:1'></a>Is this just a bug with equality, or is it a bug with elements of quotient algebras in general? I would hope that either `xbar * ybar` or `ybar * xbar` would be simplified, but neither is:

```
sage: xbar*ybar
xbar*ybar
sage: ybar*xbar
ybar*xbar
```
As you might expect, `xbar * ybar + ybar * xbar` does not simplify to 0, either.
