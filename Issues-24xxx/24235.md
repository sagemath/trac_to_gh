Currently we can iterate over all subsets satisfying a hereditary property, for example

```
from sage.combinat.subsets_hereditary import subsets_with_hereditary_property
list(subsets_with_hereditary_property(lambda x: prod(x) < 100, range(2,10)))
```

Let's make it possible to iterate over maximal subsets; in this example [6, 9] and [2, 3, 4] would be maximal but [2, 3] would not.
