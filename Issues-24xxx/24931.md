Some comments from #24930 apply here too.

And it seems that the `__richcmp__` is really only meant to check for equality, so I would add

```
if op != Py_EQ and op != Py_NE:
    return NotImplemented
```

Indeed. I don't think you even need the full `__richcmp__`.  I implemented this just as an `__eq__`, but for that to work requires Cython 0.28 or a patched Cython.

It doesn't make sense to use `rich_to_bool` here at all.  All you need is 
`return (self.__prec == _other.__prec and self.rnd == _other.rnd) == (op == Py_EQ)`

Right now you have:

```python
if not isinstance(other, RealField_class):
    return NotImplemented
```

which I think was Jeroen's suggestion.  The reason for this is that it will delegate comparison to the class of the right-side object if it is not an instance of `RealField_class`.  So that sort of makes sense.  But I'm concerned about making that the general approach.  

For example, the tests contain:

```
    sage: RealField(10) == IntegerRing()
    False
```

which currently will work.  But why, then, isn't the same logic applied in `IntegerRing`?  Currently its `__richcmp__` is (somewhat arbitrarily?) implemented rather differently:

```python
    def __richcmp__(left, right, int op):
        """
        Rich comparison of ``left`` and ``right``.

        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.rings.integer_ring import IntegerRing_class
            sage: ZZ == ZZ
            True
            sage: ZZ != QQ
            True
        """
        if left is right:
            return rich_to_bool(op, 0)

        if isinstance(right, IntegerRing_class):
            return rich_to_bool(op, 0)

        if isinstance(right, sage.rings.rational_field.RationalField):
            return rich_to_bool(op, -1)

        return op == Py_NE
```

That sort of grew out of the old implementation of `IntegerRing_class._cmp_`, but I don't think this is really right either.  Just as in the case of `RealField_class`, this seems to mostly just care about equality (though it seems it should also return less than `RationalField`? What's that about?).

If `IntegerRing_class.__richcmp__` also contained something like `if not isinstance(right, IntegerRing_class): return NotImplemented`, and then you attempted the aforementioned comparison, instead of a boolean result you'll get a `TypeError` exception.

So my question becomes, should a class always delegate rich comparison to the other object, and if not when should it and when shouldn't it?

I'm sorry, I was wrong here (though I cannot for the life of me find where this is actually documented).  If both `a.__eq__(b)` and `b.__eq__(a)` return `NotImplemented`, then Python falls back on the default comparison which is by `id()`.  I think that's also the case (in reverse) for `__ne__`.  It's only in the case of the ordering operators where it raises `TypeError`.

I think that clarifies things for me then.  We should probably change `IntegerRing_class.__richcmp__` to be more consistent, but this is fine as is.

Every time I think I understand Python's rich comparison it turns out I've forgotten half of what I'd learned.
