<div id="comment:0"></div>

The elements/parents of polynomial-like objects have different methods to access the variables. This ticket stands for normalizing them.

First of all, `CategoryObject` has
- an (rather unspecified) attribute `_names`
- `variable_names`: return the values of `_names`
- `variable_name`: return the first item in `_names`
(see also #21380)

On parent, beyond the one inherited from `CategoryObject` there are:
- uni or multivariate `(Laurent)PolynomialRing` and `PowerSeries`: `variable_names_recursive`
- `LaurentPowerSeries`: none

And for the elements:
- `UnivariatePolynomial`: `variable_name` and `variables`
- `MultivariatePolynomial`: `variable` (uncomprehensible) and `variables`
- `(Laurent)PowerSeries`: `variable` (returning a string)
