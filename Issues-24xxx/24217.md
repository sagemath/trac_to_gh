I think there is a general logic error with AlarmInterrupt in that it can be raised in a destructor, where Python will then ignore it. This causes doctest timeout like:

```
sage: try:  # long time
    alarm(1)
    while True:
        D._save(s, fn)
except (AlarmInterrupt, OSError, AttributeError):
    # OSError could happen due to a double close() in
    # Python's tempfile module.
    # AttributeError could happen due to interrupting
    # in _TemporaryFileWrapper.__init__
    # (see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22423)
    pass ## line 201 ##
Exception cysignals.signals.AlarmInterrupt: AlarmInterrupt() in <bound method _TemporaryFileWrapper.__del__ of <closed file '<fdopen>', mode 'w+b' at 0xc8023390>> ignored

Not sure what the right solution is, though. Ideally, the signal would be delivered as soon as the dtor is completed.

Replying to [ticket:24217 vbraun]:
> Python will then ignore it.

There is nothing that `cysignals` can do about that. I consider it a Python bug: if `__del__` can't handle exceptions, it shouldn't check for signals either. See https://bugs.python.org/issue31388

I don't see a solution without patching Python somehow.

The problem is not signal handling, the problem is that Python throws away exceptions.

This is actually more or less how Python internally handles interrupts. It's not literally multi-threaded, but I don't think that this matters. When an interrupt occurs, it just sets a flag that the interpreter checks at suitable times.

So two possible fixes that I see (both involve patching Python):

1. Python should only check for signals when it can actually handle them.

2. Python should have a mechanism to deal with unraisable exceptions: say, a callback method `__unraisable__` on the exception object. That way, we can re-enable the interrupt flag when a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is ignored.

I think that 2. can realistically be implemented, but I don't feel like fighting with Python upstream to make them accept that change (they are extremely conservative and it's hard to push any non-trivial changes).
