Can you give me a brief synopsis of what you know, what you want, and where you're stuck?

From a quick look at your branch, you are doing conversion maps, which are not coercion maps and do not automatically get invoked with actions.

Also, I don't like the hack with the category on `ResidueLiftingMap`. I suspect you should implement a proper `Homset` parent.

Huh. I guess that branch was an accident. I do not recall doing anything on this ticket. Looks quite unrelated too. So basically I did nothing.

Well I do know the difference between/coercion and conversion. 

So I have to teach sage a conversion here. Namely to extend the base ring to the quotient field.
Where do I do that? Where is left / right multiplication even defined?
Where do I start?

It seems the bug lies in the following example.
This is good

```
sage: L.<a> = NumberField(x^3+x-1)
sage: OL = L.ring_of_integers()
sage: P = MatrixSpace(OL,1,1)
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: pushout(P,L)
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 1 dense matrices over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 + x - 1
```
and here comes the bug

```
sage: pushout(L,P)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CoercionException                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-50299fa24306> in <module>()
----> 1 pushout(L,P)

/home/simon/sage_working/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/categories/pushout.pyc in pushout(R, S)
   3992         # make sense, and in this case simply want to return that a pushout
   3993         # couldn't be found.
-> 3994         raise CoercionException(ex)
   3995 
   3996 

CoercionException: base field and extension cannot have the same name 'a'
```

If I swap the input elements in `sage.categories.pushout.pushout, then scalar multiplication works just fine. Thus I believe this is the underlying cause.
