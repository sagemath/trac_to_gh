```
sage: A = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
sage: A.set_immutable()
sage: loads(dumps(A)).is_immutable()
False
```

from `explain_pickle(dumps(A))` it looks like the pickling routine for `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense` is just a little too naive. For several other base rings immutability is preserved.

It should just be a matter of appending on another optional value `immutable=True` to the `unpickle_matrix_mod2_dense_v1` (or maybe call it `v2` with an `register_unpickle_override`) and just add the extra input of the `_is_immutable` to the corresponding `__reduce__`. So I did that on this branch.
