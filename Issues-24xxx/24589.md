```
sage: A = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
sage: A.set_immutable()
sage: loads(dumps(A)).is_immutable()
False
```

from `explain_pickle(dumps(A))` it looks like the pickling routine for `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense` is just a little too naive. For several other base rings immutability is preserved.

It's probably a simple fix in case anyone would like to try to do it for Sage 8.4 (which I believe will be accepting new fixes for ~1 week).
