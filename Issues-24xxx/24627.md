This ticket also makes a small (and safe) change to comparison semantics:

Sage's implementation of comparison in real and complex ball fields used to make all elements (even non-point intervals) equal to themselves, because the documentation of arb specifies that “Identical pointers are understood to give permission for algebraic simplification”. In spite of this provisio, arb itself now provides comparison functions with x != x for inexact x. This commit makes the corresponding change in Sage for consistency. I wouldn't consider this a breach of compatibility since, in geneal, x != y returning False for two balls x, y does not guarantee that the corresponding reals are distinct.

Good move.

However, i got a failing doctest in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`, that reveals a criminal (though documented) failure in the previous behaviour of `RBF`, that `x = RBF(1.0, 0.1) ; x == x` returns `True`. The doctest seems to have been introduced in #22087 without complain.

Let me suggest to:

- move the doctest `x = RBF(1.0, 0.1) ; x == x` to something specific to ARB (it has nothing to do with polynomials actually)
- add the doctest that triggered #22087 proposed at [/22076#comment:5 #22076:comment:5] in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`
- adapt the doctests corresponding to `RIF` in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` (the block just above) to the `RBF` case.
