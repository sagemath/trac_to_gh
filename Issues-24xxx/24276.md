Several doctests in that file are marked `# todo: not implemented (binding; see __getattr__)`. It's not entirely clear to me what the file `semigroups_cython.pyx` is actually trying to do, but those tests can easily be fixed be using a standard Python class for `ElementMethods` instead of a `cdef class`.
