Several doctests in that file are marked `# todo: not implemented (binding; see __getattr__)`. It's not entirely clear to me what the file `semigroups_cython.pyx` is actually trying to do, but those tests can easily be fixed be using a standard Python class for `ElementMethods` instead of a `cdef class`.

For whatever it's worth, the point of this file was to explore and track how far one could Cythonize a category. If there is zero potential benefit to be expected from using cdef class, then yes, we might as well revert back to standard Python class.

Thanks for investigating!
