I'm surprised something like this isn't already in Sage though that's not something I'm really qualified to comment on.  I suspect there's also probably a better place to put this than starting a new top-level package.

I can make some minor nitpicks on the code itself if you think that would be helpful.

@embray I don't know if your nitpicks are good. After all, I know nothing about you. You decide if you do the work.

I am going to add yet one feature: Converting a function into a binary relation. However I will be busy today. I have not yet dived into details of this feature.

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A11):
> I suspect there's also probably a better place to put this than starting a new top-level package.

I agree. A top-level package is supposed to contain many modules and/or packages. 

I suggest to put this module into `sage.combinat.relations`. 

On the other hand, `sage.sets.relations` would be a bad choice as `sage.sets` is concerned with generic sets.
