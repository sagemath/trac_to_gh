Ticket #23210 adds `immediate_dominators` method for `DiGraph` while the Boost method `dominator_tree` provides the same result and is significantly faster.

With this ticket, we:
- enable the computation of the dominator tree in the reverse graph. This is done by adding parameter `reverse` to methods initializing boost graphs
- use `dominator_tree` in method `strong_articulation_points`
- deprecate method `immediate_dominators` that is slower and do less than the `dominator_tree` method.
