We implement neighbor method (neighbour method) for quadratic forms. We just combine `find_p_neighbor_from_vec`, `is_globally_equivalent_to` and `find_primitive_p_divisible_vector__next`.

<a id='comment:10'></a>A few minor things:

```diff
-rational forms we just pretend the base ring is ZZ::
+rational forms we just pretend the base ring is ``ZZ``::
```

While the error message says it only takes `ZZ`, the code also allows for `QQ`:

```python
    if self.base_ring() not in [ZZ, QQ]:
        raise NotImplementedError("the base ring of this form must be the integers")
```
Can you explain this discrepency?

```diff
-      if G.denominator()!=1:
-        raise ValueError("the associated bilinear form q(x+y)-q(x)-q(y) must be integral.")
+      if G.denominator() != 1:
+        raise ValueError("the associated bilinear form q(x+y)-q(x)-q(y) must be integral")
```

```diff
-    if p!=2 and b % p**2 != 0:
+    if p != 2 and b % p**2 != 0:
```

Is `assert y*G*y % 8 == 0, (y, G)` something that is expected to always succeed or is it meant to catch bad input?

There will be problems mixing `yield` and nontrivial `return` statements:

```diff
-            return iter([v.lift() for v in Q.orbits_lines_mod_p(p)
-                        if v!=0 and Q(v.lift()).valuation(p) > 0])
+            yield from (v.lift() for v in Q.orbits_lines_mod_p(p)
+                        if v != 0 and Q(v.lift()).valuation(p) > 0)
+            return
```

Easier way to copy a list:

```diff
-waiting_list = copy(seeds)
+waiting_list = list(seeds)
```

It would be a little more readable if the subsequent lines of

```
    orbs = libgap.function_factory("""function(gens, p)
```
were also indented.

Basically neighbors make sense for half integral quadratic forms,
that is, with base ring `ZZ` and values in `1/2 ZZ`. 
However base_ring and domain are not yet separated, so we have to include rational forms.
