Okay, I'm working on it.  From what I can tell there are still a handful of fixes in here that haven't made it into the mainline yet.

Yes, if you want to check an *exact* type using `type(foo) is bar` is orders of magnitude faster, because it's just a pointer comparison.

`isinstance(...)` is a much more complex beast that needs to be able to support things like subclasses as well as `__instancecheck_` and `__subclasscheck__`.  So it's better, especially in Cython code, to do exact type comparisons when that's all you need in a particular case.

In most cases I do advocate for generator expressions, but for small collections there's actually more overhead in terms of setting up the generator object and iterating over it than it's worth.  For example:

```
In [1]: x = list(range(4))

In [2]: %%timeit
   ...: names = []
   ...: names.extend(str(_) for _ in x)
   ...:
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.19 µs per loop

In [3]: %%timeit
   ...: names = []
   ...: names.extend([str(_) for _ in x])
   ...:
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 µs per loop
```

You can also see in the [list.extend](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/69b4a17f342146d6b7a73975a37678db9916aa75/Objects/listobject.c#L799) implementation that it has a more optimized code path for the case where it's given a list or tuple and can use the `PySequence_Fast` API, as opposed to the more generic path of having to guess what the new size of the list will be (using `__length_hint__` if there is one) and slowly iterate over the iterable.

Thank you very much for this detailed explanation. Then I agree that current formulation is good.

To avoid merge conflict with #27342, you should revert some changes
- `linear_functions.pyx` (same done in #27342)
- `mip.pyx`: 

```diff
-            sage: x_sol.keys()
