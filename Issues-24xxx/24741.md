Okay, I'm working on it.  From what I can tell there are still a handful of fixes in here that haven't made it into the mainline yet.

Yes, if you want to check an *exact* type using `type(foo) is bar` is orders of magnitude faster, because it's just a pointer comparison.

`isinstance(...)` is a much more complex beast that needs to be able to support things like subclasses as well as `__instancecheck_` and `__subclasscheck__`.  So it's better, especially in Cython code, to do exact type comparisons when that's all you need in a particular case.

Hmm, not that it really matters much here either way but I'm not sure [comment:19](#comment%3A19) is necessarily much of an improvement.  In most cases I do advocate for generator expressions, but for small collections there's actually more overhead in terms of setting up the generator object and iterating over it than it's worth.  For example:

```
In [1]: x = list(range(4))

In [2]: %%timeit
   ...: names = []
   ...: names.extend(str(_) for _ in x)
   ...:
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.19 µs per loop

In [3]: %%timeit
   ...: names = []
   ...: names.extend([str(_) for _ in x])
   ...:
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 µs per loop
```

You can also see in the [list.extend](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/69b4a17f342146d6b7a73975a37678db9916aa75/Objects/listobject.c#L799) implementation that it has a more optimized code path for the case where it's given a list or tuple and can use the `PySequence_Fast` API, as opposed to the more generic path of having to guess what the new size of the list will be (using `__length_hint__` if there is one) and slowly iterate over the iterable.

Of course that's all implementation detail and there's no guarantee in the language that this should be faster.  By rights the generator expression should be "better" but in practice it isn't, at least for small lists.

Thank you very much for this detailed explanation. Then I agree that current formulation is good.

To avoid merge conflict with #27342, you should revert some changes
- `linear_functions.pyx` (same done in #27342)
- `mip.pyx`: 

```diff
-            sage: x_sol.keys()
