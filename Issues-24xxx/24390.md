The following code 

```
W = WeylGroup("A3", prefix="s")
s = W.simple_reflections()
w = s[2]*s[1]
print(w)
print(w.coset_representative([1], side = 'left'))
print(w.coset_representative([1], side = 'right'))
```
prints 

```
s2*s1
s2*s1
s2
```

which means that the definition of left/right coset in this method is the opposite of the more common one. See e.g.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset) or [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Coset_in_a_group](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Coset_in_a_group).

I suspect this was done to make the coding easier or it was based on an older standard of left/right cosets. I have confirmed that the wikipedia definition matches Humpreys, Lang, and Dummit--Foote.

While I do not have a particular preference one way or the other (in part, because I can never remember which one is which), this change is likely to very subtly break code with an annoying deprecation as it must always appear.

There are some books which use the opposite convention but it does seem that the Wikipedia one is more common.

I have the same problem. Even if we don't change the code we should definitely state the convention explicitely in the docstring.
