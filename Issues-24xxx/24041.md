The deprecation warning introduced in #19550 about changing parameter name from `method` to `algorithm` in some graphs methods is 2 years old. So it's time to remove it.

Similarly, the warning introduced in #21111 about renaming parameter `certify`to `certificate` is 14 months old. Time to remove it.
