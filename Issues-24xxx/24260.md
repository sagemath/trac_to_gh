This is crazy:

```
sage: "abc" ^ 5
'abcabcabcabcabc'
```
We already have multiplication with the same behaviour and it's an error in Python:

```
>>> "abc" ** 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
```
