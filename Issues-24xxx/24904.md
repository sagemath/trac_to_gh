This ticket proposes to make JupyterLab a standard package.

This would require converting `jupyterlab` and `jupyterlab_widgets` from "pip" packages to "normal" packages (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-source-types)
and adding their dependencies as "normal" packages as well.
#34450 allows us to use (non-platform) wheels instead of source packages, which simplifies things because we can avoid Javascript dependencies that are only needed at build time.


This is a mechanical task, which is assisted by https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#utility-script-to-create-packages but not fully automated (`dependencies` needs to be updated manually).

<a id='comment:1'></a>There are two "rules" about standard packages:

1. New standard packages should be optional first.

2. There should be a discussion/vote on sage-devel for a new standard package.

Of course, exceptions are always possible for good reasons, but I see no such reason for jupyterlab.
