I do not get how #24067 would solve the issue on this ticket. `sympy` **is** a dependence of docbuilding.

Yes, and that's the bug that #24067 fixes. It shouldn't be a dependency.

Anyway, given that #24067 is stalled, we should merge this anyway. And since it breaks building Sage, it should even be a blocker.
