There is a highly optimized method `_real_mpfi_` on quadratic number field elements. Though Sage prefers going through the call conversion

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2, embedding=AA(2).sqrt())
sage: RIF.coerce_map_from(K)
Call morphism:
  From: Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  To:   Real Interval Field with 53 bits of precision
```
