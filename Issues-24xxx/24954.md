```
There is some very bad behaviour related to `CachedRepresentation` caching that I'm observing on #24742 (but this is otherwise unrelated to that ticket):

```
sage: timeit('MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,3)')
625 loops, best of 3: 117 µs per loop
```
Now, we try again but we first create a strong reference:

```
sage: S = MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,3)
sage: timeit('MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,3)')
625 loops, best of 3: 4.13 µs per loop
```
This is much faster the second time! In the first example, the caching 
of `CachedRepresentation.__classcall__` is pointless since there is no 
strong reference to the entry in the cache, so it gets deleted 
immediately whenever the `MatrixSpace(ZZ,3,3)` is deleted.

This is just the usual `Py_DECREF` of Python objects, it has nothing to do with the cyclic garbage collector: the behaviour remains the same even 
with `gc.disable()`.

This makes me think that we might need to change `CachedRepresentation` 
to use semi-strong references: these would only be deleted by the 
cyclic garbage collector but not by a simple `Py_DECREF()`.

Idea: SemiWeakValueDictionary will initially create a strong reference to each value (say, by means of a class attribute holding a list containing the items), and gc.collect() will be monkey-patched so that it first removes all strong references kept by SemiWeakValueDictionary before doing the cyclic collection.

In that way, the values of SemiWeakValueDictionary would be permanent till the next cyclic garbage collection occurs.

Would that work?

I will try to implement (C), which is:

(C) create a "guardian" with a reference to itself (so that it will only be deleted during cyclic garbage collection) and create a weak reference with callback from the class SemiWeakValueDictionary to the guardian. The callback function will both restore the weak reference to the guardian and clears the strong references to the values -- and apparently the callback function is only called when a cyclic collection happens.

I thought (C) would work as follows:

```
sage: from weakref import WeakValueDictionary, ref
sage: class Guardian(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self._self = self
....:         
sage: class SWVD(object):
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def collect(*foo):
....:         print "collect"
....:         SWVD.guard = ref(Guardian(), cls.collect)
....:         SWVD.refs = []
....:     refs = []
....:     guard = ref(Guardian(), collect)
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.D = WeakValueDictionary()
....:     def __getitem__(self, k):
....:         return self.D[k]
....:     def __setitem__(self, k, v):
....:         self.D[k] = v
....:         SWVD.refs.append(v)
....:         
sage: class MyThing(object):
....:     def __del__(self):
....:         print "<{}> gone".format(id(self))
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         print "new thing for {}".format(n)
....:         
sage: D = SWVD()
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
```
That's fine. But something went wrong:

```
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
Exception TypeError: "'staticmethod' object is not callable" in <staticmethod object at 0x7f8cda18b2f0> ignored
58
```
So, why is the static method not callable? What requirements are made for the callback of a weak reference?

Ouch, I found the problem: An unreferenced variable "cls" in the callback function that shouldn't belong there...

Nonetheless, so far, I don't get it to work.

Got it.

Problem: During creation of the class SWVD, I wanted to refer to an attribute of that class. Apparently it didn't work. So, now, I am setting the class attribute during initialisation of the first instance of that class.

```
sage: from weakref import WeakValueDictionary, ref
sage: import gc
sage: class Guardian(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self._self = self
....:         
sage: class SWVD(object):
....:     @classmethod
....:     def collect(cls, *foo):
....:         print "collect"
....:         cls.guard = ref(Guardian(), cls.collect)
....:         cls.refs = []
....:     refs = []
....:     guard = None
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         if self.__class__.guard is None:
....:             self.__class__guard = ref(Guardian(), self.__class__.collect)
....:         self.D = WeakValueDictionary()
....:     def __getitem__(self, k):
....:         return self.D[k]
....:     def __setitem__(self, k, v):
....:         self.D[k] = v
....:         SWVD.refs.append(v)
....:         
sage: class MyThing(object):
....:     def __del__(self):
....:         print "<{}> gone".format(id(self))
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         print "new thing for {}".format(n)
....:         
sage: D = SWVD()
```
Elements of a SemiWeakValueDictionary aren't immediately deleted:

```
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
sage: a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a
new thing for 2
```
But they *are* deleted when a garbage collection happens:

```
sage: gc.collect()
collect
<139776980263696> gone
<139776980313808> gone
<139776980313104> gone
71
```
I guess the above would basically work, although I would prefer to define `SWVD.guard` during creation of the class and not during creation of its first instance.

**Edit:** I also tested `a = D[2] = MyThing(2); del a` in a loop, and indeed a "spontaneous" garbage collection does result in the deletion of the dictionary values, just as it should. So, this time I am not just touching the Python layer of the gc module...
