This ticket is being opened for proposed work to be done at a coding sprint sponsored by the IMA. 

We wish to add methods to the ClusterTriangulation (#16310) to 

* Compute bangles and bracelets for essential loops.
* Implement tagged triangulations and tagged arcs.

See the following for details:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4364

https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0748

Depends on #16310
