<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

Welcome to Sagemath.

I have several comments on your ticket, some on the presentation and some on the algorithms you use.

Let's start with general comments, mostly on the presentation. I give them for the first method, but you should do the same for the other methods.
- `effective_resistance(self,i,j)` -> `effective_resistance(self, i, j)`
- `Returns the effective resistance between nodes i and j` -> <code>Return the effective resistance between nodes \`i\` and \`j\`.</code>
- Please add a description of the notion of effective resistance. What is it?
- You could add a link to the wikipedia page (e.g., in the seealso block). Should be <code>See :wikipedia:\`Resistance_distance\`</code> for more details
- Text lines (comments, definition, etc. must be in 80 columns format. Some code editors like emacs help you to do that without effort

- `a straight linear 2-tree on 6 vertices`. Well, I assume it's a Path graph of order 6, no?
- then you can use: `G1 = graphs.PathGraph(6)`
- replace `G1` with `G` since you don't have `G2`

- in the test with the complete graph, you check only 1 edge. I assume you want to should that the resistance of each edge is `1/2`, right? so you could do instead:

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: all(G.effective_resistance(u, v) == 1/2 for u,v in G.edge_iterator(labels=0))
True
```
- Since I'm not familiar with this definition, it is not easy to tell which tests are important or not.
- Could you tell us what is the expected behavior if the graph has loops, multiple edges, is empty, is not connected ?

We will get to the algorithmic part latter. I need to understand the definition first. I have the feeling that we can do something faster, may be in another ticket.

Thanks for your very helpful comments! I think I made all the presentation changes you submitted

>a straight linear 2-tree on 6 vertices. Well, I assume it's a Path graph of order 6, no? then you can use: G1 = graphs.PathGraph(6)

No, a straight linear 2-tree is like a ladder made out of triangles, not a path. 

>Since I'm not familiar with this definition, it is not easy to tell which tests are important or not.
>Could you tell us what is the expected behavior if the graph has loops, multiple edges, is empty, is not connected ?

Multiple edges should lower the effective resistance between pairs of nodes. A 'parallel' network transformation demonstrates how this works, but this is another method we are working on implementing at this Sagedays!

An empty graph has no node pairs, so an error should be returned for effective_resistance, and an empty matrix for effective_resistance_matrix. 

I hadn't thought about connected graphs.  Effective resistance between edges in different components should be infinity or return an error.  I'll work on that. Also, loops should not be allowed.  I'll fix that as well. 

>We will get to the algorithmic part latter. I need to understand the definition first. I have the feeling that we can do something faster, may be in another ticket.

Interesting, I would be happy to find out that this is true!

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:8\" align=\"right\">Comment 8</div>\n\nIn the description of the method, use <code>\\`i\\`</code> instead of just `i`. This indicates that this is math code. It will be handled when generating the html documentation and so well displayed. You can also put latex equations if you like (e.g., `\\sqrt{x^3+1} \\leq 2`).\n\nFor wikipedia links, the `_` in <code>:wikipedia:\\`Resistance_Distance\\`</code> is needed. If corresponds to the name of the page you see in the url [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_distance)\n\nWhen you have parameters with default value, don't put spaces. So `def effective_resistance_matrix(self, nonedgesonly = True):` -> `def effective_resistance_matrix(self, nonedgesonly=True):`. The same when you call the method.\n\n<code>if \\`\\`True\\`\\` eliminate pairs of adjacent vertices</code>. Well, you don't eliminate pairs, you assign them value 0. It's different, no?\n\nI prefer `self.order()` to `self.num_verts()`.\n\n\nFor `least_effective_resistance`, you should rewrite like that (should be much faster).\n\n```\n    self._scream_if_not_simple()\n    if nonedgesonly and self.is_clique():\n        return []\n    S = self.effective_resistance_matrix(nonedgesonly=nonedgesonly)\n    if nonedgesonly:\n        edges = self.complement().edges(labels=0)\n    else:\n        edges = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1,n)]\n    rmin = min(S[e] for e in edges)\n    return [e for e in edges if S[e] == rmin]\n```\nThe `self._scream_if_not_simple()` will raise an error if the graph has loops or multiple edges. You don't need to add specific tests for that.\n\nFor `effective_resistance(self, i, j):`, you have to decide of what to do when `i == j` and you should check `if not i in self or not j in self:`. \n\nThe case of non connected should be treated at some point. \n- method 1: if not in same component return `+oo` or 0. Otherwise, do computation only on that component\n- method 2: you can certainly build the matrix from the results on each connected components\n- method 3: You can do computations independently on each components and collect the result (faster than working on a big matrix)",

In the description of the method, use <code>\`i\`</code> instead of just `i`. This indicates that this is math code. It will be handled when generating the html documentation and so well displayed. You can also put latex equations if you like (e.g., `\sqrt{x^3+1} \leq 2`).

For wikipedia links, the `_` in <code>:wikipedia:\`Resistance_Distance\`</code> is needed. If corresponds to the name of the page you see in the url [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_distance)

When you have parameters with default value, don't put spaces. So `def effective_resistance_matrix(self, nonedgesonly = True):` -> `def effective_resistance_matrix(self, nonedgesonly=True):`. The same when you call the method.

<code>if \`\`True\`\` eliminate pairs of adjacent vertices</code>. Well, you don't eliminate pairs, you assign them value 0. It's different, no?

I prefer `self.order()` to `self.num_verts()`.


For `least_effective_resistance`, you should rewrite like that (should be much faster).

```
    self._scream_if_not_simple()
    if nonedgesonly and self.is_clique():
        return []
    S = self.effective_resistance_matrix(nonedgesonly=nonedgesonly)
    if nonedgesonly:
        edges = self.complement().edges(labels=0)
    else:
        edges = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1,n)]
    rmin = min(S[e] for e in edges)
    return [e for e in edges if S[e] == rmin]
```
The `self._scream_if_not_simple()` will raise an error if the graph has loops or multiple edges. You don't need to add specific tests for that.

For `effective_resistance(self, i, j):`, you have to decide of what to do when `i == j` and you should check `if not i in self or not j in self:`. 

The case of non connected should be treated at some point. 
- method 1: if not in same component return `+oo` or 0. Otherwise, do computation only on that component
- method 2: you can certainly build the matrix from the results on each connected components
- method 3: You can do computations independently on each components and collect the result (faster than working on a big matrix)

Thanks for the review.

I don't think least_effective_resistance requires vertices as a perimeter as the user is generally interested in finding the least resistance wrt the whole graph. Still if it is required I can add that. Although I did add this 

```
        verts = list(self)

        S = self.effective_resistance_matrix(vertices=verts, nonedgesonly=nonedgesonly)

In method `effective_resistance`:
- I prefer this definition:

```diff
-        This is the resistance between two equivalent points of a simple connected graph
-        replacing each edge by a 1 ohm resistance.
+        The resistance distance between vertices `i` and `j` of a simple
+        connected graph `G` is defined as the effective resistance between the
+        two vertices on an electrical network constructed from `G` replacing
+        each edge of the graph by a unit (1 ohm) resistor.
```
- 

```diff
-              a similar method giving a matrix full of all effective resistances between all nodes
+              a similar method giving a matrix full of all effective
+              resistances between all nodes
```
- remove the '.' at the end of `raise ValueError('the Graph is not a connected graph.')`

In method `effective_resistance_matrix`
- add similar definition than above
- a `;` is missing

```diff
-        - ``nonedgesonly`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True`` assign 
+        - ``nonedgesonly`` -- boolean (default: ``True``) if ``True`` assign 
```
- remove `.` at the end of `raise ValueError('the Graph is not a connected graph.')`
- 

```diff
-        S = d*onesvec.transpose() + onesvec*d.transpose() - 2* M
+        S = d * onesvec.transpose() + onesvec * d.transpose() - 2 * M
```

In `least_effective_resistance`
- add similar definition than above
- may be simpler message

```diff
-            raise ValueError('unable to compute least resistance for an empty Graph object')
+            raise ValueError('unable to compute least resistance on empty Graph')
```
- remove `.` at the end of `raise ValueError('the Graph is not a connected graph.')`
-

+            edges = [(verts[i], verts[j]) for i in range(n) for j in range(i + 1, n)]

+        S = d * onesvec.transpose() + onesvec * d.transpose() - 2 * M

```


But according to pep8

Yes:

x = x*2 - 1

hypot2 = x*x + y*y

c = (a+b) * (a-b)

No:

x = x * 2 - 1

hypot2 = x * x + y * y

c = (a + b) * (a - b)

first one seems to be more right

Am I missing something?

Follow-up question at 

- [Ask Sage question 63701: Effective resistance matrix and `nonedgesonly=True`](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/63701)

Defaulting to `nonedgesonly=False` might have seemed more natural.

Since all examples and tests use `False`,
why was `True` made the default?
