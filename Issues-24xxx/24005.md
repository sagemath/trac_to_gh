When `pcre` builds, although I see 

```
checking bzlib.h usability... yes
checking bzlib.h presence... yes
checking for bzlib.h... yes
```
I later see

```
    Link pcregrep with libbz2 ....... : no
```
Maybe we need to use the `--enable-pcregrep-libbz2` flag when configuring. To do on a later ticket, if there is a need.

Yes, I saw that. So maybe it doesn't actually depend on bzip2. Still, it doesn't hurt much to add this dependency even if it is not strictly needed.
