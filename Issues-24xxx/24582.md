Along with some related fixes to `sage.misc.explain_pickle` (which otherwise still has many failures on Python 3 due mostly to string/bytes differences).

Most of these fixes have to do with pickling, especially minor differences in the API of the `pickle` module.

*probably* not, since in Python 2 the `cPickle.Unpickler` class has some oddities, and in particular its `find_globals` attribute has some strange behavior.  But I agree it might be worth a try...

Oh I remember now, the only reason the tests for `SageUnpickler` even work on Python 2 is that it's subclassing the pure Python implementation in that case, which is less strange but also slower.

But perhaps I could make a single `SageUnpickler` class that delegates to the preferred underlying implementation.

I see many pickling failures in the python3 doctests.

Yes, I keep picking up work on this at like...the end of the day, getting distracted by something else, and forgetting it again.  I need to re-implement the `SageUnpickler` class to work on both Python 2 and 3, which is not hard, I just...have to do it.

Now that #25153 is closed that helps too.

This certainly lays the groundwork to fix issues like that, but I'll have a look at whatever's going on there.

The above issue is that it's creating pickles with Python 2 backwards-compatibility (the `fix_imports=True` argument to `pickle.dumps`).  However, the reverse should also work when loading such pickles on Python 3.
