Trying to make progress on my backlog of Python 3 fixes I haven't made tickets for...

This one is slightly questionable in that there were many `cpdef` functions in this package that take `char *` arguments, and I changed them to take non-typed arguments (effectively `str`).

I'm not exactly sure what implication this has for the C interfaces that were exported for these methods, or if we care.

They don't seem to be performance-critical methods, so I'm fine with it.

One potential problem for reviewing this ticket is that it involves several external packages, some of which are not even free to install.

It is a problem, and some of these modules are not well tested because of it.  Though in the cases I've changed it should be fairly clear that it's the right approach in general (i.e. we are passing python `str`s to interfaces that expect `char *`).

How about a new function `filename_to_bytes()`? I never liked the look of `str_to_bytes(fname, FS_ENCODING, 'surrogateescape')` anyway, `filename_to_bytes(fname)` would look much better.

How does this ticket now relate to #26020?  It wasn't clear to me why it needed to broken into a separate ticket in the first place.

Are we still going to add `filename_to_bytes()`?  I like the idea but it should probably be done separately.

I can see that there's a case to be made for still allowing some of these methods to accept filenames as bytes, but I think this is fine for now until and unless a specific need for it arises.
