The real balls (e.g. `RBF`) and the real intervals (e.g. `RIF`) are meant to achieve the same goal: provable real computations. This task ticket stands to discuss how to unify their interface (and possibly adapt the other floating point fields as well).

- clean the clumsy c++ dependency #24285
- should the parent be extension classes? In particular, is it wiser to have function factories or inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`?
- Creation of new elements in Cython. This boil down to some allocation together with affectation of the parent. Should this be done in `__cinit__` (as it is the case for `RIF`) or `__init__`? We might definitely want to let the possibility of having pools (see #17670).
- semantics of comparisons
