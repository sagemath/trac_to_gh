This is a change separated out from #22509, to add support for `spkg-postinst` scripts in SPKGs.  These are run after `spkg-install` and, in the case of packages that support `$SAGE_DESTDIR`, after the package's main files have been copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

This allows for post-installation steps that are easier to perform once the package has been installed into its runtime context.  It *may* be used to generate additional files which are not tracked.  In this it would be good to have an `spkg-postrm` script that cleans up any such files, but for now that is omitted since we don't have proper package uninstallation yet (this was added in #22510 which still needs to be updated).

Depends on #24644

From #25139, I see there's still an unresolved issue here: When running post-install scripts the `$SAGE_DESTDIR` variable should *not* be set anymore (or even unset).

By design, the post-install scripts run after the package files have already been moved into the real `$SAGE_LOCAL`, so any commands run in the post-install scripts should not use `$SAGE_DESTDIR`.
