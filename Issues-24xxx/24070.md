Currently the interface for Gfan (used in the groebner_fan and associated methods in rings/polynomial/groebner_fan.py) forbids sets of variables in which the name of a variable is the prefix for another, since Gfan itself does not allow this.  

This is inconvenient in cases where one uses a list of variables such as x1,x2,x3,...,x10, since x1 is a prefix of x10.  This ticket removes this restriction by replacing the input variable names before sending them to Gfan, and then converting back.

This was requested by the developers of the new phc interface (ticket:23114).
