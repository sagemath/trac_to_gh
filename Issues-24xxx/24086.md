This ticket is a follow-up to #18061, concerning Atkin--Lehner actions.

Firstly, with that ticket the Atkin--Lehner action is only implemented in a certain subset of cases. It would be nice if we could compute the pseudo-eigenvalues for any newform.

Secondly, there is a normalisation discrepancy: according to the docstring of `sage.modular.modform.element.ModularForm_abstract.atkin_lehner_action`, our conventions are supposed to be that the pseudo-eigenvalues of the Atkin--Lehner operator W_d should have absolute value d<sup>k/2</sup> - 1. However, it doesn't seem that this convention is being enforced very consistently:

```
sage: f = Newforms(24, 4)[0]
sage: f
q + 3*q^3 + 14*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f.atkin_lehner_eigenvalue(8)
-1
sage: f.atkin_lehner_eigenvalue(3)
-3
```

Keywords: **atkin-lehner**

Here's a patch. As well as fixing the normalisation issue, I've readjusted our conventions to be more consistent with the standard reference (Atkin--Li 1978) -- the previous version was out by a root of unity in some cases -- and added some more examples and doctests.

This is a small thing, in src/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py in documentation for the method _compute_atkin_lehner_matrix, there should be an example where the sign isn't 0 so that it hits the ValueError.

The rest looks good so far.
