Right, I forgot about this in my branch.
(it must be there, I should have cherry-picked more carefully)
the only include is in src/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.pyx, I gather.

By the way, with this extra it builds and starts.

oops, it's `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/specs/cdf.py`
(the former one is autogenerated)

I've updated my branch accordingly, just in case.
