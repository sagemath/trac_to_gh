I have some computation essentially solving a linear program using Gurobi which use 4 processes in parallel. When I time them, the following outputs look normal, i.e., the CPU time is about 4 times the wall time:

```python
    sage: %time computation(15)
    CPU times: user 27min 11s, sys: 5.93 s, total: 27min 16s
    Wall time: 6min 53s
    sage: %time computation(17)
    CPU times: user 2h 2min, sys: 24.7 s, total: 2h 2min 25s
    Wall time: 30min 43s
```

But for larger computation, then something strange happens, i.e., it says the CPU time takes only 27 minutes, while the wall time is more then 17 hours. I was expecting something like 68 hours for the CPU time:

```python
    sage: %time computation(21)
    CPU times: user 27min 49s, sys: 17 s, total: 28min 6s
    Wall time: 17h 25min 50s
```

Is it because the total CPU times takes more than one day?
