There are several bugs like:

```
sage: arccoth(float(1.1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'precision'

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-96f50dbce315> in <module>()
----> 1 arccoth(float(RealNumber('1.1')))

/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/function.pyx in sage.symbolic.function.BuiltinFunction.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/function.cpp:11828)()
    993             res = self._evalf_try_(*args)
    994             if res is None:
--> 995                 res = super(BuiltinFunction, self).__call__(
    996                         *args, coerce=coerce, hold=hold)
    997

    487             res = g_function_evalv(self._serial, vec, hold)
    488         elif self._nargs == 1:
--> 489             res = g_function_eval1(self._serial,
    490                     (<Expression>args[0])._gobj, hold)
    491         elif self._nargs == 2:

SystemError: <built-in function __import__> returned a result with an error set
```

This is due to an unhandled exception elsewhere in `numeric.cpp`.  This is a problem on Python 2 as well, but by luck the exception is cleared later before it becomes a problem (whereas Python 3 is more aggressive in checking for unhandled exceptions when going into a function call).
