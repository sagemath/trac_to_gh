    sage: rows = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [0,1], [2,3,4,5], [0], [1,2,3,4,5]]
    sage: x = dlx_solver(rows)
    sage: x
    Dancing links solver for 6 columns and 6 rows
```

Return the first solution found when the computation is done in parallel::

```
    sage: x.first_solution_found_in_parallel(ncpus=8)
    [0, 1]
```

Find all solutions using some specific rows::

```
    sage: x_using_row_2 = x.restrict([2])
    sage: x_using_row_2
    Dancing links solver for 6 columns and 6 rows
    sage: list(x_using_row_2.solutions_iterator())
    [[2, 3]]
```

Adding `nrows`, `ncols` and `restrict` is a good idea. However in the doctest I would have used an example with a number of rows different from the number of columns.

I really don't like the name `first_solution_found_in_parallel`. Why should we care that it is in parallel? I would just call it `one_solution` and have a `ncpus` parameter (the very same way it is right now for `number_of_solutions`).

In the `first_solution_found_in_parallel` are you sure that the subprocesses are stopped once a solution has been found? (I don't believe it). If you want such a thing to happen you need to explicitely call `terminate()` on the pool. The `@parallel` interface is not nice enough. See [https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html). And this needs careful doctesting.

Having `number_of_solutions` exhausts the iterator but not `first_solution_found_in_parallel` is a mistake in the interface.

I think I do have a problem on my computer (parallel is not working at all). Could you write the following in a file

```
from sage.parallel.decorate import parallel
from time import sleep
from sage.misc.prandom import randint

@parallel
def f(n):
    sleep(randint(0,3))
    return n
```
and check whether the following runs in parallel

```
sage: from WHERE_IT_IS import f
sage: list(f(range(10)), ncpus=3)
```
On my computer, only one process is launched at a time.

Moreover, if the iterator is not exhausted and I quit Sage, I got an `OSError`such as

```
sage: F = f(range(10),ncpus=3)
sage: next(F)
(((0,), {}), 0)
sage: quit
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.30s, Wall time 0m5.49s).
Exception OSError: OSError(2, 'No such file or directory') in <generator object __call__ at 0x7f5118bc7410> ignored
```

I see what you mean. I was able to reproduce. Calling next once launches all the processes, and it seems the user is expected to exhaust the generator before exiting. It may be a bug. In my case, I do not use the `next`.

But if I use it in a for loop, and call `return` inside the loop, then it is okay. Can you confirm?
