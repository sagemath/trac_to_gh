    sage: rows = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [0,1], [2,3,4,5], [0], [1,2,3,4,5]]
    sage: x = dlx_solver(rows)
    sage: x
    Dancing links solver for 6 columns and 6 rows
```

Return the first solution found when the computation is done in parallel::

```
    sage: x.first_solution_found_in_parallel(ncpus=8)
    [0, 1]
```

Find all solutions using some specific rows::

```
    sage: x_using_row_2 = x.restrict([2])
    sage: x_using_row_2
    Dancing links solver for 6 columns and 6 rows
    sage: list(x_using_row_2.solutions_iterator())
    [[2, 3]]
```

Done.

okay, I changed it to `one_solution`

Should `some_solution` be better following the idioms used in Sage like `some_element` ...

No I am not sure. I was trusting the ``@`parallel` decorator. Why should this `terminate` handling not be done inside the ``@`parallel` code?

I just double checked running code on examples (Wang tiling in a 12x12 box). And all cpus stop working at the same time when one solution is found and returned. So to me, the code is okay for this aspect.

```
sage: dlx
Dancing links solver for 1200 columns and 1872 rows
sage:
sage: %time sol = dlx.one_solution(ncpus=8)
CPU times: user 4 ms, sys: 60 ms, total: 64 ms
Wall time: 6.77 s
```

I think I do have a problem on my computer (parallel is not working at all). Could you write the following in a file

```
from sage.parallel.decorate import parallel
from time import sleep
from sage.misc.prandom import randint

@parallel
def f(n):
    sleep(randint(0,3))
    return n
```
and check whether the following runs in parallel

```
sage: from WHERE_IT_IS import f
sage: list(f(range(10)), ncpus=3)
```
On my computer, only one process is launched at a time.

Moreover, if the iterator is not exhausted and I quit Sage, I got an `OSError`such as

```
sage: F = f(range(10),ncpus=3)
sage: next(F)
(((0,), {}), 0)
sage: quit
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.30s, Wall time 0m5.49s).
Exception OSError: OSError(2, 'No such file or directory') in <generator object __call__ at 0x7f5118bc7410> ignored
```
