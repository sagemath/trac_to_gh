Related: some Python packages don't use `pip` at all:

```
gambit
numpy
pillow
scons
setuptools
```
For `setuptools`, this is obvious because it's a dependency of `pip`.

In #24014, getting rid of the `PIP_INSTALL` environment variable was postponed for the sake of work in progress on `brial` and `dot2tex`.

Since #24092, `brial` no longer uses `PIP_INSTALL`.

Now that #23983 is closed, all that remains to do is to stop using  `PIP_INSTALL` for `dot2tex`, allowing to remove `PIP_INSTALL` entirely.

In retrospect there is one small possible use for a variable like this, in case users for some particular reason needed to override and/or extend the default flags passed to pip.  I could sort of envision a reason for that in theory, though I don't know one explicitly.

In any case, the current implementation wouldn't work that way anyways, and something more like `PIP_INSTALL_FLAGS` would be better for that use case.
