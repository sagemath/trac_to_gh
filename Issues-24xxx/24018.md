<a id='comment:3'></a>In #24014, getting rid of the `PIP_INSTALL` environment variable was postponed for the sake of work in progress on `brial` and `dot2tex`.

Since #24092, `brial` no longer uses `PIP_INSTALL`.

Now that #23983 is closed, all that remains to do is to stop using  `PIP_INSTALL` for `dot2tex`, allowing to remove `PIP_INSTALL` entirely.

In any case, the current implementation wouldn't work that way anyways, and something more like `PIP_INSTALL_FLAGS` would be better for that use case.
