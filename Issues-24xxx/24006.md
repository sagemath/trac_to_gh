There are 46 SymPy object member functions named `_sage_()` that comprise the SymPy-->Sage conversion facility. It turns out that automatic testing the code at the SymPy Travis never worked and is difficult to fix because of fitting Sage into Travis. Secondly, after initial work on it by SymPy authors work is now mainly motivated with Sage development where the maintenance of interdependent Sage and SymPy patches begins to be unwieldy and error-prone.

This branch contains experimental code that dynamically adds `_sage()_` methods on the first SymPy conversion to the relevant objects.

See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13430

Depends on #23990

I'll try `make distclean ; make ptestlong`, but don't hold your breath...

Aaaarghhh... I *did* waste CPU. For some (now unscrutable) reason, I have been unable to `make` sage : some plot used in the documentation refuses to build.

Currently ptesting 8.1.beta7+#23990 again to check that the problemis indeed with the present patch (and reinstalling my 434 or so R packages...).

The next time you position `needs_review` to get the attention of a patchbot, could you leave a note to potential reviewers ?

On top of #24026 (which needs review ;-), I can't even build the documentation (hence no formal testing possible). See uploaded log.

And yes, I did `./sage -f sympy` before `( make doc-clean && make ptestlong)`.

Testing on top of #24026, `ptestlong` gives me two errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Both are transient (i. e. both tests pass when ran standalone).

An example of possible usefulness :

```
sage: dgamma(y,k,theta)=y^(k-1)*e^(-y/theta)/(theta^k*gamma(k))
sage: (dgamma(y,k,theta).laplace(y,x)^p).expand().canonicalize_radical().inverse
....: _laplace(x,y)
ilt(1/((theta*x + 1)^(k*p)), x, y)
sage: sympy.inverse_laplace_transform((dgamma(y,k,theta).laplace(y,x)^p).expand(
....: ).canonicalize_radical(),x,y)._sage_()
k*p*theta^(-k*p)*y^(k*p - 1)*e^(-y/theta)*heaviside(y)/gamma(k*p + 1)
```

I won't be able to test further right now. I'll try to find more examples (that could be useful doctests...).

Did you translate Sympy's conditional expressions in your recent `cases` ?

Another thought : we might subclass `sage()` as a wrapper for `_sage_()` possibly allowing for further arguments, such as supplementary translation dictionaries, as originally intended for mathematica.sage() (but this does not seem to worl currently...). Another ticket ?

Oh, BTW : `positive_review`

Hello,

I am trying to extend your interface to the function Subs:

```
dH = Subs(Derivative(h(_xi_1, u/2 - v/2), _xi_1), (_xi_1,), (u/2 + v/2,))
```

where h is an abstract function.

I tried to add the function in src/interfaces/sympy.py :  

```
def _sympysage_Subs(self):
    """
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sympy import Symbol
        sage: from sympy.core.singleton import S
    """

    args = self.args
    func = args[0]
    substi = [(args[1][i],args[2][i]) for i in range(len(args[1]))]

    print (substi)
    #s = args[0].subs(substi)
    return s

```

But I am experimenting recursion problems (for this reason s is commented).
I tried to use the function Subs(...).doit() but it has no effect.

On top of #20204 I get with your code (comment removed):

```
sage: from sympy import Subs, Derivative, Function, Symbol
sage: _xi_1 = Symbol('_xi_1')
sage: u = Symbol('u')
sage: v = Symbol('v')
sage: h = Function('h')
sage: x._sympy_()
x
sage: dH = Subs(Derivative(h(_xi_1, u/2 - v/2), _xi_1), (_xi_1,), (u/2 + v/2,))
sage: dH._sage_()
[(_xi_1, u/2 + v/2)]
Subs(Derivative(h(_xi_1, u/2 - v/2), _xi_1), (_xi_1,), (u/2 + v/2,))
```
Using this code however:

```
    args = self.args
    substi = dict([(args[1][i]._sage_(),args[2][i]._sage_()) for i in range(len(args[1]))])
    s = args[0]._sage_().subs(substi)
```
I get:

```
sage: dH._sage_()
D[0](h)(1/2*u + 1/2*v, 1/2*u - 1/2*v)
```

I just noticed this:

```

################################################################
```

This is **not acceptable** for Sage, all files in the Sage library are supposed to be licensed under GPL version 2 or later.

Do you agree to change this to GPL version 2 or later?
