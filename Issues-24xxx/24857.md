Some functions on matrices, polynomials, power series, etc dispatch to methods of the base ring in order to do the actual work.  For example, `smith_form` to `_matrix_smith_form`, `factor` to `_factor_univariate_polynomial`.  Some base rings require special keyword arguments, and many have doctests that check specific features of that implementation.  It would be nice if the docstring of the special dispatching method (e.g. `factor`) could be replaced with the docstring of the dispatched method (e.g. `_factor_univariate_polynomial`) in the case that the special method was present on the base ring.

A decorator to do this seems reasonable, and would mean that people reading the docstring for `factor` over the integers don't have to page through special information about factoring over the complex numbers.
