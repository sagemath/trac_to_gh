Some recent change - possibly #23713 - has changed the behaviour of `@`parallel.  Now, unless I set SAGE_NUM_THREADS, my parallel functions only use 1 thread.  Previously they used as many threads as I have cpus, which seems like a much nicer default.

Running sage 8.2beta5 with SAGE_NUM_THREADS unset in my environment gives this:

```
sage: os.environ["SAGE_NUM_THREADS"]
'1'
```
As a result, ncpus is wrong

```
sage: sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()
1
```
The correct answer here should be 4 (on my test machine):

```
sage: os.sysconf("SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN")
4
```

I confirm the bug and could trace it down to some changes between Sage 8.1.beta5 and 8.1.beta8. On my computer (Intel Core i7-6700HQ), with Sage 8.1.beta5 and all previous versions:

```
sage: from sage.parallel.ncpus import ncpus
sage: ncpus()
8
```
while with Sage 8.1.beta8 and all versions above:

```
sage: from sage.parallel.ncpus import ncpus
sage: ncpus()
1
```
So yes, a very probable culprit is #23713, which has been merged in Sage 8.1.beta8.

A consequence of this is the follwing bug reported at
https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42439/parallel-how-to-use-all-cpus/

The problem is that it's very hard to figure out a good default that works for everybody (from single users on desktop machines to server farms).

If it is a feature, then the documentation of `ncpus()` must be updated, making some reference to `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`. The current docstring says:

```
Detects the number of effective CPUs in the system.
```

Yes please. 
For instance, it would be convenient to have a replacement for the old `ncpus()`, i.e. a function that does return the total number of CPUs on the computer. In the present stage, all the code that does that (starting at line 56 of `src/sage/parallel/ncpus.py`) seems unreachable: starting a sage session sets the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` to 1, so that `ncpus()` is basically equivalent to `return 1`.

For coherence with the must used threads library (openmp) the number of "available" threads should be set to the maximum available on the machine (which turns to be the consistent with old behavior) ant he function sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus, coherently with its definition, return this value.
This "avalable" value is assumed also the default for parallelism. 
In the other hand, if parallelism is not invoked explicitly sage will we use only a processus.    

As in openmp, the user could redefine the default value (ncpus) for parallelism defining a environment variable : SAGE_NUM_THREADS (like OMP_NUM_THREADS).

The actual behavior which sets ncpus = 1 is if not a bug, a no desired behavior and should be corrected.

See #25779 for a duplicate.

I think `ncpus()` should return the number of cores (maybe unless overwritten by some environment variable) because that's what the name implies. I don't have a very strong opinion on how `@parallel` should work exactly but I feel that "1" is a poor default for most of our casual users. I personally liked the "min(8,cores)" logic that I think was taking place before. In any case, `@parallel` should certainly mention `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` in its documentation.

Btw, you can set `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=0` to get the old behaviour back, I think.

I think `ncpus()` should return the number of cores, just like https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.cpu_count

And by default `@`parallel should use all of them, just like OpenMP.

I honestly don't understand what is the point of returning something else.
If the sage community thinks that sage in its own routines should do something different, then write those limitations into sage's source code but don't change default behavior of a tool to make that happen.
Makes much more sense to see in sage's source code 

```
@parallel(ncpus=internal_sage_ncpus())
```
than the user having to always remember to do

```
import multiprocessing
@parallel(ncpus=multiprocessing.cpu_count())
```


For last, in case of server farms, if a sysadmin thinks that a user shouldn't use all the cores available by default, then it is his job to set the correct defaults, e.g., via environment variables,  that guides the user to the desired usage, just like one does in HPC servers.
