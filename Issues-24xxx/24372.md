In the `Map` method `_extra_slots`, a dict is passed as input. That dict is then modified in-place and also returned as output.

This awkward logic is not needed for anything. We simplify this by not passing a dict as input and creating a new dict from scratch if needed.

LGTM overall, but I do not feel 100% comfortable relying on an uninitialized `zero_element` being `None` by default:

```
        if self.zero_element is None:
            self.zero_element = self._codomain.zero()
```
So I would add `self.zero_element = None` in the `__init__`.

Probably we should also add the other cdef classes (such as `Z_to_quadratic_field_element`) to the `.pxd` file, but that can be done on a followup.

Interestingly, http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/special_methods.html#initialisation-methods-cinit-and-init says

"Any Python attributes have also been initialised to `None`, but you probably shouldnâ€™t rely on that."
