This ticket implements Euclidean spaces as Riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to **R**<sup>n</sup> and equipped with a flat metric, which defines the Euclidean dot product. Using the operators introduced in #24622, this provides the standard operators of vector calculus: dot product, norm, cross product, gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian, along with the standard coordinate systems (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.).

See this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40792/div-grad-and-curl-once-again/) for a motivation, as well as this [one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41898/).

The implementation is performed via the parent class `EuclideanSpace`, which inherits from `PseudoRiemannianManifold` (introduced in #24622). Two subclasses are devoted to specific cases: 
- `EuclideanPlane` for n=2
- `Euclidean3dimSpace` for n=3
The user interface for constructing an Euclidean space relies on the `EuclideanSpace.__classcall_private__` to direct to the appropriate subclass.

The implementation through the manifold framework allows for an easy use of various coordinate systems, along with the related transformations. However, the user interface does not assume any knowledge of Riemannian geometry. In particular, no direct manipulation of the metric tensor is required. 

A minimal example is

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = EuclideanSpace(3)
sage: v = E.vector_field(-y, x, 0)
sage: v.display()
-y e_x + x e_y
sage: v[:]
[-y, x, 0]
sage: w = v.curl()
sage: w.display()
2 e_z
sage: w[:]
[0, 0, 2]
```
The transformation to spherical coordinates:

```
sage: spherical.<r,th,ph> = E.spherical_coordinates()
sage: spherical_frame = E.spherical_frame()  # orthonormal frame (e_r, e_th, e_ph)
sage: v.display(spherical_frame)
sqrt(x^2 + y^2) e_ph
sage: v.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
r*sin(th) e_ph
sage: v[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
[0, 0, r*sin(th)]
sage: w.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
2*cos(th) e_r - 2*sin(th) e_th
sage: w[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
[2*cos(th), -2*sin(th), 0]
```

Is there a way to use something like (say) `vector([x<sup>2+y,y</sup>2+z,z^2+x])` as  "vector field" immediately, without much (or any) of the formalism necessary in that notebook?

<a id='comment:15'></a>Here is some status update: functionalities regarding the 2-dimensional case are almost complete, as you can see in this [demo worksheet](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/Euclidean_plane.ipynb) (any feedback is of course appreciated). The 3-dimensional case is under preparation. The generic n-dimensional case, with n=1 or n>=4 is ready, since only Cartesian coordinates will be introduced (by default) in this case. 

Regarding a question raised in comment:10, it is now possible to construct a vector field on an Euclidean space from a `vector` of symbolic expressions like this:

```
v = E.vector_field(vector([-y,x]))
```
where `E` is the underlying Euclidean space.

+This ticket implements Euclidean spaces as Riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to **R**<sup>n</sup> and equipped with a flat metric, which defines the Euclidean dot product. Using the operators introduced in #24622, this provides the standard operators of vector calculus: dot product, norm, cross product, gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian, along with the standard coordinate systems (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.).
 
+See this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40792/div-grad-and-curl-once-again/) for a motivation, as well as this [one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41898/).
+
+The implementation is performed via the parent class `EuclideanSpaceGeneric`, which inherits from `PseudoRiemannianManifold` (introduced in #24622). Two subclasses are devoted to specific cases: 
+- `EuclideanPlane` for n=2
+- `Euclidean3dimSpace` for n=3
+The user interface for constructing an Euclidean space relies on a single function: `EuclideanSpace`.
+
+The implementation through the manifold framework allows for an easy use of various coordinate systems, along with the related transformations. However, the user interface does not assume any knowledge of Riemannian geometry. In particular, no direct manipulation of the metric tensor is required. 
+
+A minimal example is
+
+```
+sage: E.<x,y,z> = EuclideanSpace(3)
+sage: v = E.vector_field(-y, x, 0)
+sage: v.display()
+-y e_x + x e_y
+sage: v[:]
+[-y, x, 0]
+sage: w = v.curl()
+sage: w.display()
+2 e_z
+sage: w[:]
+[0, 0, 2]
+```
+The transformation to spherical coordinates:
+
+```
+sage: spherical.<r,th,ph> = E.spherical_coordinates()
+sage: spherical_frame = E.spherical_frame()  # orthonormal frame (e_r, e_th, e_ph)
+sage: v.display(spherical_frame)
+sqrt(x^2 + y^2) e_ph
+sage: v.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
+r*sin(th) e_ph
+sage: v[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
+[0, 0, r*sin(th)]
+sage: w.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
+2*cos(th) e_r - 2*sin(th) e_th
+sage: w[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
+[2*cos(th), -2*sin(th), 0]
+```
+
+More detailed examples are in the following Jupyter notebooks:
+
+- [vector calculus in Cartesian coordinates](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/vector_calc_cartesian.ipynb)
+- [vector calculus in spherical coordinates](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/vector_calc_spherical.ipynb)

I remove the function `EuclideanSpace` and just used the `__classcall_private__` mechanism (provided by `UniqueRepresentation`) to make the class `EuclideanSpace` (formerly `EuclideanSpaceGeneric`) the main entry point.

There is something very subtle happening as *some* of the doctest output for display names of `arctan2(y, x)` needed to be `arctan(y/x)`. I do not understand why nor could I see what was causing this. It is not a blocker issue, but it is an indication that something might not be working properly.

sage: E3.<x,t,p> = EuclideanSpace(coordinates='spherical')
