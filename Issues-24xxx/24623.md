This ticket implements Euclidean spaces as Riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to **R**<sup>n</sup> and equipped with a flat metric, which defines the Euclidean dot product. Using the operators introduced in #24622, this provides the standard operators of vector calculus: dot product, norm, cross product, gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian, along with the standard coordinate systems (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.).

See this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40792/div-grad-and-curl-once-again/) for a motivation, as well as this [one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41898/).

The implementation is performed via the parent class `EuclideanSpace`, which inherits from `PseudoRiemannianManifold` (introduced in #24622). Two subclasses are devoted to specific cases: 
- `EuclideanPlane` for n=2
- `Euclidean3dimSpace` for n=3
The user interface for constructing an Euclidean space relies on the `EuclideanSpace.__classcall_private__` to direct to the appropriate subclass.

The implementation through the manifold framework allows for an easy use of various coordinate systems, along with the related transformations. However, the user interface does not assume any knowledge of Riemannian geometry. In particular, no direct manipulation of the metric tensor is required. 

A minimal example is

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = EuclideanSpace(3)
sage: v = E.vector_field(-y, x, 0)
sage: v.display()
-y e_x + x e_y
sage: v[:]
[-y, x, 0]
sage: w = v.curl()
sage: w.display()
2 e_z
sage: w[:]
[0, 0, 2]
```
The transformation to spherical coordinates:

```
sage: spherical.<r,th,ph> = E.spherical_coordinates()
sage: spherical_frame = E.spherical_frame()  # orthonormal frame (e_r, e_th, e_ph)
sage: v.display(spherical_frame)
sqrt(x^2 + y^2) e_ph
sage: v.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
r*sin(th) e_ph
sage: v[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
[0, 0, r*sin(th)]
sage: w.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
2*cos(th) e_r - 2*sin(th) e_th
sage: w[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
[2*cos(th), -2*sin(th), 0]
```

<a id='comment:10'></a>That's great!  The reason I brought it up is because folders like `sage/calculus` and `sage/symbolic` might benefit from some good examples that are easy to find.

Is there a way to use something like (say) `vector([x<sup>2+y,y</sup>2+z,z^2+x])` as  "vector field" immediately, without much (or any) of the formalism necessary in that notebook?  I think that is how most end users I've talked to about this issue would want it.  See e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10104/gradient-divergence-curl-and-vector-products/ and ticket:3021 for one version already in Sage - maybe these should be combined somehow, if possible.

Yes, this is precisely the aim of the current ticket. The above notebook is still at the level of semi-Riemannian manifolds (i.e. it illustrates only ticket #24622), while the user interface of the current ticket will be much simpler. It should also provide an easy way to change from Cartesian coordinates to e.g. polar or cylindrical ones. 


>See e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10104/gradient-divergence-curl-and-vector-products/ and ticket:3021 for one version already in Sage - maybe these should be combined somehow, if possible.


Thanks for pointing this version; I was not aware of it.

Regarding a question raised in[comment:10](#comment%3A10), it is now possible to construct a vector field on an Euclidean space from a `vector` of symbolic expressions like this:

```
v = E.vector_field(vector([-y,x]))
```
where `E` is the underlying Euclidean space.

-This ticket implements Euclidean spaces as Riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to **R**<sup>n</sup> and equipped with a flat metric.

+This ticket implements Euclidean spaces as Riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to **R**<sup>n</sup> and equipped with a flat metric, which defines the Euclidean dot product. Using the operators introduced in #24622, this provides the standard operators of vector calculus: dot product, norm, cross product, gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian, along with the standard coordinate systems (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.).
 
 See this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40792/div-grad-and-curl-once-again/) for a motivation.
 
-Some functionalities introduced by this ticket are illustrated in this [Jupyter worksheet](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/Euclidean_plane.ipynb). 
+The implementation is performed via the parent class `EuclideanSpaceGeneric`, which inherits from `PseudoRiemannianManifold` (introduced in #24622). Two subclasses are devoted to specific cases: 
+- `EuclideanPlane` for n=2
+- `Euclidean3dimSpace` for n=3
+The user interface for constructing an Euclidean space relies on a single function: `EuclideanSpace`.
+
+The implementation through the manifold framework allows for an easy use of various coordinate systems, along with the related transformations. However, the user interface does not assume any knowledge of Riemannian geometry. In particular, no direct manipulation of the metric tensor is required. 
+
+A minimal example is
+
+```
+sage: E.<x,y,z> = EuclideanSpace(3)
+sage: v = E.vector_field(-y, x, 0)
+sage: v.display()
+-y e_x + x e_y
+sage: v[:]
+[-y, x, 0]
+sage: w = v.curl()
+sage: w.display()
+2 e_z
+sage: w[:]
+[0, 0, 2]
+```
+The transformation to spherical coordinates:
+
+```
+sage: spherical.<r,th,ph> = E.spherical_coordinates()
+sage: spherical_frame = E.spherical_frame()  # orthonormal frame (e_r, e_th, e_ph)
+sage: v.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
+r*sin(th) e_ph
+sage: v[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
+[0, 0, r*sin(th)]
+sage: w.display(spherical_frame, spherical)
+2*cos(th) e_r - 2*sin(th) e_th
+sage: w[spherical_frame, :, spherical]
+[2*cos(th), -2*sin(th), 0]
+```
+
+More detailed examples are in the following Jupyter notebooks:
+
+- [vector calculus in Cartesian coordinates](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/vector_calc_cartesian.ipynb)
+- [vector calculus in spherical coordinates](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/vector_calc_spherical.ipynb)

There is something very subtle happening as *some* of the doctest output for display names of `arctan2(y, x)` needed to be `arctan(y/x)`. I do not understand why nor could I see what was causing this. It is not a blocker issue, but it is an indication that something might not be working properly.

<a id='comment:35'></a>The above commit fixes the `arctan` issue mentioned in[comment:31](#comment%3A31): it was due to the declaration 

```
sage: E3.<x,t,p> = EuclideanSpace(coordinates='spherical')
```
in line 591 of `euclidean.py`, which had the side effect of adding `x>0` to Sage's assumptions. Then subsequent doctests involving `arctan2(y, x)` automatically replaced it by `arctan(y/x)`. I changed the variable `x` to `r` in the declaration of `E3` (which btw fits better with standard notation for spherical coordinates) and everything was OK, i.e. all `arctan2(y, x)` could be restored. 

Moreover, since it is now possible to skip the dimension as first argument of `EuclideanSpace` in constructions of the type `E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()` (thank you for this improvement!), I systematically removed the dimension argument and added a sentence in the documentation about this. 

I also took the opportunity of this commit to add a [single-line fix](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.py?id=220726c07bc00ba69b12a5cc7dc9499d930f1e8c) of a (small) bug in `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.py` revealed after the dependency ticket #24792 was merged. I hope you do not mind.
