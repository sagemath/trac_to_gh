Trivial things, but it makes it look nice:

```diff
         if isinstance(i.lower(), AnInfinity):
             if isinstance(i.upper(), AnInfinity):
-                return ZZ(0)
+                return ZZ.zero()
             else:
-                return i.upper()-1
+                return i.upper() - 1
         if isinstance(i.upper(), AnInfinity):
-            return i.lower()+1
+            return i.lower() + 1
```
Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
