This is algorithm 3.4.3 from Markus Kirschmer's "Definite quadratic and hermitian forms with small class number"  It returns a global quadratic form corresponding to a given set of local invariants.

A few little things:

```diff
-    Let `(a_1,...,a_n)` be the gram marix of a regular quadratic space.
+    Let `(a_1, \ldots, a_n)` be the gram marix of a regular quadratic space.
     Then Cassel's Hasse invariant is defined as
 
     .. MATH::
 
-        \prod_{i<j} (a_i,a_j)
+        \prod_{i<j} (a_i,a_j),
 
     where `(a_i,a_j)` denotes the Hilbert symbol.
```

Should `gram` be capitalized to `Gram`?

`if F!=QQ:` -> `if F is not QQ:`

Error messages should start with a lowercase letter.

The `assert all()` does not need the list comprehension, so you just need

```
assert all((a*d).valuation(p) % 2 == 1 for p in Pprime)
```

Why is a function `QuadraticFormFromInvariants` following class definition CamelCase and not the using `quadratic_form_from_invariants`? It is not constructing a particular class.

I believe that in this way it is easier to discover.
With `QuadraticForm` + autocomplete. 
An alternative would be to access this functionality via
`QuadraticForm` directly?

What I mean is to give the parameters as input to the constructor of the `QuadraticForm` class.
So the syntax would be
`Quadraticform(QQ,invariants=[....])`
or
`Quadraticform(QQ,rk,det,P,signatures)`?
After all we are constructing a single quadratic form from some input?

Either one of those options would be much better IMO. It also means there is precisely one place in the documentation and code that people should go-to/use.
