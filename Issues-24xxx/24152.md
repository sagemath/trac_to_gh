Conversion of a Sage polyhedron into Polymake fails in the first attempt, but succeeds in the second attempt. I've put the example into the first comment rather than in the ticket description.

The fix is to install the `File::Slurp module` into perl5. This ticket updates the information about prerequisites (and how to install them) in `build/pkg/polymake/SPKG.txt`.

Note that a user reported that the above point count is incorrect in Sage, that's why I tested what polymake has to say (and find that it agrees with Sage).

So, the bug is that the first attempt of converting P fails, while the second attempt succeeds.

Sage does not control the Perl installation.

Which makes me repeat the question: How to install the slurp module?

```
$ apt-cache search perl slurp
hobbit-plugins - plugins for the Xymon network monitor
libdbix-simple-perl - Perl module implementing an simpler interface to DBI
libfile-policy-perl - Simple policy for file I/O functions
libfile-read-perl - interface for reading one or more files
libfile-slurp-perl - single call read & write file routines
libfile-slurp-tiny-perl - simple, sane and efficient file slurper
libfile-slurp-unicode-perl - Perl module to add Unicode support for the File::Slurp package
libfile-slurper-perl - simple, sane and efficient module to slurp a file
libperl6-slurp-perl - module implementing the Perl 6 'slurp' built-in
libtext-clip-perl - module to clip and extract text in clipboard-like way
```
Which of the above do I need to install? Hint: It isn't libfile-slurper-perl either.

`sudo apt-get install libfile-read-perl` seems to do the trick. Afterwards, I get

```
sage: polymake(Polyhedron(eqns = eqns, ieqs=ieqs))
Polytope<Rational>[SAGE271]
sage: _.N_INTERIOR_LATTICE_POINTS
952
sage: __.N_LATTICE_POINTS
1260
```

Anyway.

I find it not good that the polymake interface depends on a specific perl module upon which polymake itself does not depend.

Is it really not possible to provide the same functionality (perhaps slower) if slurp is not installed? If there is a way around slurp then that should be used as a fallback.

And if there is no way around slurp, then the polymake interface should complain about it right in the beginning, giving specific advice on how to install slurp, alerting the user that (s)he has to take care about perl5, not perl6, and so on.

I'd guess (but haven't tested because I am not on Ubuntu) that it would simply be `libfile-slurp-perl`. The one that you picked probably installs it as a dependency.

The distribution-independent way of installing Perl packages, of course, is using CPAN. 

Specific error handling for failure to load `File::Slurp` is a good idea.

One could, of course, provide a simplified version of `read_file` directly, instead of requiring `File::Slurp`. But I don't think it's worth it.
