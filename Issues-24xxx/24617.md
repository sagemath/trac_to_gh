For some reason, Solaris `make` forks an unbounded number of processes with the Sage top-level `Makefile`. This is worse than simply breaking, so we add some protection.

The problem is that we have historically always allowed just `make` to configure and build Sage. So whatever is done in `./configure` is too late since you may already be running `make`.

What is not what we want?

There is already logic in the top-level `Makefile` to do exactly that (running `./configure`). But that's not relevant to this ticket, which is about running `make` *before* `./configure`.
