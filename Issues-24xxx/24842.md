This ticket proposes to add an automatic build for [binder](https://mybinder.org) to the CI infrastructure from #24655.

Even though there is no support for this in trac yet, people could manually link to the generated binder configuration in their trac tickets. This would make it possible to try the proposed changes out without having to checkout and build the ticket.

If you want to try this out, you can go to the (automatically generated) commit in this [github repository](https://github.com/saraedum/tree/sage-binder-env/binder).

<img src="binder.png" width=640, center>

From personal experience, I see a number of reasons why this could be useful:
* (At Sage Days, new) contributors could start reviewing easy tickets right away without getting frustrated by having to rebuild Sage all the time because they checked out some old branches.
* Some people use the Sage binaries in their distribution but don't really want to start hacking on Sage on their machines. They still would like to push a certain ticket that is fixing a bug they are experiencing. They are (understandably) reluctant to give things a postitive review without having it tried out themselves.
* When sharing experimental code with others you usually want to keep the hurdles as low as possible. A link to a Jupyter notebook that just works is certainly much more convenient than complicated instructions on how to git checkout and make a ticket.
