So the changes to `tensor_operations.py` would not be necessary if we add `range` to the known Python classes handled by `cartesian_product`:

```diff
-native_python_containers   = set([tuple, list, set, frozenset])
+native_python_containers   = set([tuple, list, set, frozenset, range])
```
It would be good if we could somehow add all possible views to this (and other similar places for previously-list objects), but `range` is the most common one that will be passed for this construction.

I also do not see the need to any changes in `abvar.py`. In Python3 (3.5.2 to be specific), I can do

```
>>> x = range(5)
>>> x[-2]
3
>>> list(x)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
so `i = rows[-1][-1]+1` should not be a problem. Additionally, `matrix_from_rows` would just convert the `range` into a `list` (although I think it probably should not do any such conversion). Am I missing something there?

Or maybe arbitrary iterables (or at least finite iterables as in `isinstance(x, Iterable) and isinstance(x, Sized)`.  The only problem I've found with this is sometimes it's necessary to take care between specific Sage objects that happen to be iterable, and arbitrary/unknown iterables that should be converted to a list.


Actually, maybe not `Sized` since a `map` is not `Sized`, and there's no (Pythonic) way to get from a `map` object what its underlying iterators are, so if it were a map of an infinite iterator you run the risk of blowing up, but I guess that's a problem in general as well.

Would a test like `isinstance(x, Iterable) and not isinstance(x, SageObject)` be good enough for most cases of "arbitrary iterable that is not otherwise meaningful to Sage"?

Unfortunately, I'm not sure your suggestion in [comment:12](#comment%3A12) would not work because generators are iterable:

```
sage: g = (x for x in ZZ)
sage: isinstance(g, collections.Iterable) and not isinstance(g, SageObject)
True
```
So there is no way to guarantee finiteness (right now, I this might be guaranteed for Python object input). Nor do we want strings to be such an object. Granted, we might be able to refine this in a reasonable way, but it will likely be a bit more involved (IDK how much from a quick look).
