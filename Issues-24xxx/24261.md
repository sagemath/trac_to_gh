This adds two new flags that can be placed next to doctests: `# py2` and `# py3`.  If marked `py2` a test will *only* be run on Python 2 and so on.

Generally this should be avoided in favor of making a test work on both in some way or another, but there are some cases where it simply doesn't make sense.  For example this test in `sage.doctest.control`

```
 640             sage: DD = DocTestDefaults(sagenb = True)
 641             sage: DC = DocTestController(DD, [])
 642             sage: DC.add_files()  # py2
 643             Doctesting the Sage notebook.
 644             sage: DC.files[0][-6:]  # py2
 645             'sagenb'
```

This doesn't work on Python 3 since we don't even install the Sage notebook on Python 3 (at least not currently).

The relevant code being tested there should also be updated to handle Python 3 better, but even so there's no practical way to make the test make sense on Python 3 until/unless sagenb is supported on Python 3.  I suspect other cases like this may come up on occasion so it's useful to have.

I considered something like that but it seems to have different semantics.  Currently "optional - pkgname" implies that a package is installed/available.  Here we don't care if python2/3 is available.  We care about what Python version is currently running the tests.

Rather than making a special case it's simpler and clearer I think to just have specific tags for this (there's also prior precedence such as using `# py3` in coverage to mark lines that should be ignored in the coverage analysis).

Right, I get that. Still, I think that we already have enough (if not too many) special doctest markers. And even if `# optional` is typically used to check whether a package is installed, I think that the meaning of `# optional - python2` is clear enough.

Moreover, there are already doctests using `# optional - python2` and `# optional - python3` referring to the current running version of Python.

That's pretty subjective--I think "enough" is however many you need to write reasonable tests.

> doctest markers. And even if `# optional` is typically used to check whether a package is installed, I think that the meaning of `# optional - python2` is clear enough.

I don't.  It's overly wordy and not quite clear at all given the double meaning.

> Moreover, there are already doctests using `# optional - python2` and `# optional - python3` referring to the current running version of Python.

Except those explicitly don't work right now.  I've already replaced a few examples using these markers.  Here's a concrete example that might help motivate:

```
                sage: import ast, sage.misc.sageinspect as sms  # py3
                sage: visitor = sms.SageArgSpecVisitor()  # py3
                sage: vis = lambda x: visitor.visit_NameConstant(ast.parse(x).body[0].value)  # py3
                sage: [vis(n) for n in ['True', 'False', 'None']]  # py3
                [True, False, None]
                sage: [type(vis(n)) for n in ['True', 'False', 'None']]  # py3
                [<type 'bool'>, <type 'bool'>, <type 'NoneType'>]
```

This entire sequence of test commands is Python 3 only and does not even make sense on Python 2 (it might be nice to tag a whole range at once actually rather than every single line but that's a separate issue).  Putting "# optional - python3" on every one of those lines is just that much more line noise.
