Some comments:

I've been told it's actually  slightly faster to actually import what you need so Python does not have to resolve the extra indirections `sage.structure.coerce_exceptions.CoercionException`.

I think it is better to explicitly label which tests are for which tickets.

In the bikeshedding realm, but I don't like removing `sage: x = polygen(ZZ)` from `TESTS` because I feel like that should be treated like an independent block (it also makes it more clear to the reader [me in this case] what `x` is by having it more local).

Otherwise LGTM.

Thanks for the review!

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A3):
> I've been told it's actually  slightly faster to actually import what you need so Python does not have to resolve the extra indirections `sage.structure.coerce_exceptions.CoercionException`.


Not done, this is slow code in any case...

> I think it is better to explicitly label which tests are for which tickets.


Done.

> In the bikeshedding realm, but I don't like removing `sage: x = polygen(ZZ)` from `TESTS` because I feel like that should be treated like an independent block (it also makes it more clear to the reader [me in this case] what `x` is by having it more local).
