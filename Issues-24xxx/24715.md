These are clearly desired doctest failures.

Second, many parents still hardcode the element type. For example, even with this patch:

```
sage: type(ZZ.one())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(RR.one())
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```
Fixing those is obviously outside the scope of this ticket.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
From a quick look at the current patchbot reports:

- There seems to be a very non-trivial side effect when wrapping `Integer` (see the `categories/examples/infinite_enumerated_sets.py`).
- The failures in `categories/sets_cat.py` and `sets/cartesian_product.py` I believe are connected with the previous point.
- We are getting `TypeError`s being raised in `modular/btquotients/pautomorphicform.py`.
- Coercion has broken in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py` coming from this check:

  ```python
                    # Over ZZ, only allow coercion from any ZZ['x']
                    # implementation to the default FLINT implementation
                    if self.element_class is not Polynomial_integer_dense_flint:
                        return None
  ```
  It would need to become `issubclass`, which means a slight speed penalty, but a necessary one.
- I think the failures in `libs/coxeter3/coxeter_group.py` and `libs/coxeter3/coxeter.pyx` are from this ticket, but I haven't verified locally.
- This uncovered a bad import: A doctest in `structure.misc` is importing `is_extension_type` from `structure.parent`: `from sage.structure.parent import is_extension_type`.
- Something is going wrong in `structure/list_clone.pyx` with pickling.

The rest look like trivial failures a la [comment:3](#comment%3A3).

I am also somewhat worried about speed regressions overall.

I think this would cause speed regression in every `cpdef` call. Whenever a type is subclasses, `cpdef` must take the slow codepath in order to check if it's been overridden. I haven't checked if cython actually does that, but this should even be the case if the subclass is an extension type, since the `cpdef` on the super doesn't know what kind of shenanigans have been played (the subtype might have grown an instance dict and the method might be overridden by a function in there).

Definitely worth checking!

It may be worth saying something about the benefits of making this chance, so that those can be weighed against the draw-backs.

I figured as much. Do make sure to include a test that confirms this behaviour, because if you'd rely on this, you'd be relying in a flaw in cython that is liable to be fixed in a future version. Given the positive side-effect of the flaw, I can imagine that the cython devs would be willing to include a pragma to revert to the old behaviour if it comes to that, but we'd have to know to prod them for it.

If we don't test it we'll probably suffer a hard to measure but possibly in some cases significant performance regression with some future cython upgrade.
