This is the basic idea. But this leads to a million (well, a lot) doctest failures of the form

```
sage -t src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_pari_ffelt.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_pari_ffelt.pyx", line 100, in sage.rings.finite_rings.element_pari_ffelt.FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt
Failed example:
    type(a)
Expected:
    <type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_pari_ffelt.FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt'>
Got:
    <class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_pari_ffelt.FiniteField_pari_ffelt_with_category.element_class'>
**********************************************************************
```
These are clearly desired doctest failures.

Second, many parents still hardcode the element type. For example, even with this patch:

```
sage: type(ZZ.one())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(RR.one())
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```
Fixing those is obviously outside the scope of this ticket.

From a quick look at the current patchbot reports:

- There seems to be a very non-trivial side effect when wrapping `Integer` (see the `categories/examples/infinite_enumerated_sets.py`).
- The failures in `categories/sets_cat.py` and `sets/cartesian_product.py` I believe are connected with the previous point.
- We are getting `TypeError`s being raised in `modular/btquotients/pautomorphicform.py`.
- Coercion has broken in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py` coming from this check:
  {{{#!python
                    # Over ZZ, only allow coercion from any ZZ['x']
                    # implementation to the default FLINT implementation
                    if self.element_class is not Polynomial_integer_dense_flint:
                        return None
  }}}
  It would need to become `issubclass`, which means a slight speed penalty, but a necessary one.
- I think the failures in `libs/coxeter3/coxeter_group.py` and `libs/coxeter3/coxeter.pyx` are from this ticket, but I haven't verified locally.
- This uncovered a bad import: A doctest in `structure.misc` is importing `is_extension_type` from `structure.parent`: `from sage.structure.parent import is_extension_type`.
- Something is going wrong in `structure/list_clone.pyx` with pickling.

The rest look like trivial failures a la[comment:3](#comment%3A3).

I am also somewhat worried about speed regressions overall.

Definitely worth checking!

It may be worth saying something about the benefits of making this chance, so that those can be weighed against the draw-backs.

I figured as much. Do make sure to include a test that confirms this behaviour, because if you'd rely on this, you'd be relying in a flaw in cython that is liable to be fixed in a future version. Given the positive side-effect of the flaw, I can imagine that the cython devs would be willing to include a pragma to revert to the old behaviour if it comes to that, but we'd have to know to prod them for it.

If we don't test it we'll probably suffer a hard to measure but possibly in some cases significant performance regression with some future cython upgrade.
