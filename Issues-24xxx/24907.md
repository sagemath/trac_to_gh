I didn't even get to see this before it was closed as "fixed", but I must insist that in the future `./configure` should not be doing weird things that modify `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Instead this should change something about how the makefile works...

Revert this commit and build Sage with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`. It should only build GCC once.

> Why would the gcc in Sage be broken?


Because the libraries it depends on are upgraded, see #24599.
