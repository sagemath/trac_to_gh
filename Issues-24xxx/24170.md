The current `vector_space()` method of finite fields is only over prime subfield of the finite field. Newly implemented `vector_space()` method returns a vector space isomorphic to the finite field viewed as a vector space over an arbitrary subfield of the finite field.

The essential functionality was already implemented in #20284, aka `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension`.  But it is presently not accessible easily. I took the implementation idea from the ticket and reimplemented it as a method to finite fields and made the interface straightforward.

```
sage: E = GF(16)
sage: F = GF(4)
sage: V, from_V, to_V = E.vector_space(F, map=True)
sage: V 
sage: from_V
Isomorphism:
  From: Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
  To:   Finite Field in z4 of size 2^4
sage: to_V
Isomorphism:
  From: Finite Field in z4 of size 2^4
  To:   Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
```

1. The name `FiniteFieldIsomorphism` is very misleading. Furthermore, as a general comment "isomorphism" is not a precise term. What about "linear isomorphism" as in?

```
sage: E = GF(16)
sage: F = GF(4)
sage: V = VectorSpace(F, 2)
sage: Hom(V,E)
Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations)
from Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
to Finite Field in z4 of size 2^4
```

2. What is the point of having empty classes `MorphismFiniteFieldToVectorSpace` and `MorphismVectorSpaceToFiniteField`? I would prefer to simply remove them and have

```diff
-        phi = MorphismVectorSpaceToFiniteField(V, self, from_V)
-        psi = MorphismFiniteFieldToVectorSpace(self, V, to_V)
+        from sage.categories.homset import Hom
+        from sage.categories.morphism import SetMorphism
+        phi = SetMorphism(Hom(V, self), from_V)
+        psi = SetMorphism(Hom(self, V), to_V)
```
  An other option is to move all the code in `vector_space` (computation of `C`, the functions `to_V`, `from_V`, etc) within the classes.

3. Did you notice the asymetry of categories

```
sage: E = GF(16)
sage: F = GF(4)
sage: V = VectorSpace(F, 4)
Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations)
from Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
to Finite Field in z4 of size 2^4
sage: Hom(E,V)
Set of Morphisms
from Finite Field in z4 of size 2^4
to Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
in Category of finite enumerated additive commutative additive groups
```

4. In the function `to_V` you should use directly `V` and not `vector`

5. In your call to `matrix` it is much faster to also specify the base ring and the dimensions.

I modelled these classes after the corresponding classes in `sage/rings/number_field/maps.py`. Look at the `NumberFieldIsomorphism`, `MapVectorSpaceToNumberField`, `MapNumberFieldToVectorSpace`.

The point is to have a proper `_repr_()` method (the morphisms are printed as `Isomorphism`).

The classes `MorphismVectorSpaceToFiniteField` and `MorphismFiniteFieldToVectorSpace` are not empty.  They are extended from `FiniteFieldIsomorphism`. So including inherited methods, each of them has 4 updated methods compared with `SetMorphism`.

I guess that you think "finite field isomorphism" is misleading. The intended meaning is "vector space isomorphism" for finite fields. I reject "linear isomorphism" (I never heard of this term). `FiniteFieldLinearTransformation` or `FiniteFieldLinearMap` is ok, but I don't prefer them over `FiniteFieldIsomorphism`.

As you can see, `sage/rings/number_field/maps.py` implements the conversion from the domain to the image in their `_call_` method. This is what I proposed in the end of the point 2 in [This is the Trac macro *comment:12* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:12-macro). So I would better go for this option.

Now, if you don't like moving the implementation of `for_V` and `to_V` as a `_call_` method of the linear isomorphisms classes you should just make the `_repr_` method more configurable. No need to make a new class.

> I guess that you think "finite field isomorphism" is misleading. The intended meaning is "vector space isomorphism" for finite fields. I reject "linear isomorphism" (I never heard of this term). `FiniteFieldLinearTransformation` or `FiniteFieldLinearMap` is ok, but I don't prefer them over `FiniteFieldIsomorphism`. 

I do. Let me say what I imagine when I read each class name
- `FiniteFieldIsomorphism` : an isomorphism between two finite fields
- `FiniteFieldLinearTransformation`: a linear map between two finite fields

No. This looks ugly. 

What do mean by "asymmetry of categories"? I get

```
sage: category(Hom(E,V))
Category of homsets of additive monoids
sage: category(Hom(V,E))
Category of homsets of additive monoids
```
Do you mean the printing?

Anyway, is this related with this ticket?

I understand your concern. But just `LinearTransformation` is also misleading because these maps are vector space *isomorphisms*. But I will not insist. This is not a big deal to me.

I doubt that I understand your suggestions well. It seems that you have a clear view of how to code the maps. So I invite you to modify the branch (now public) as you prefer. I am quite willing to accept your modifications as long as Sage gets a working `E.vector_space(F)` method :-)

Indeed, they are *vector space* isomorphisms ;-)

I implemented what I proposed (and also squashed your commits into one).

For the sake of this ticket there are several things to be fixed

1. The code does not work with

```
sage: F = GF(9)
sage: x = polygen(F)
sage: E.<y> = F.extension(x^3 - x + 1)
sage: E.vector_space(F)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'PolynomialQuotientRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute 'vector_space'
```

2. There are no examples involving a custom field such as `F = GF(9, 't', modulus=(x^2+x-1))`

3. It would be better to not impose the subfield to have a coercion implemented. I would propose to allow to pass a morphism as argument to vector space instead of a subfield. (as you wish that could be a double use of `subfield` or an extra argument `inclusion_map`).

4. The example `E = GF(16)` and  `F = GF(4)` is by far too trivial. In this case you have `V = GF(p<sup>n)</sup>m` with the same n and m.

Right. These "finite fields" are actually `PolynomialQuotientRing_field`. They are second citizen in terms of functionality as finite fields. My opinion is that finite fields defined with custom modulus should be reimplemented to be elevated to the first class citizen, and the current `PolynomialQuotientRing_field` is just a patch work.

Anyway this ticket (or at least me) does not deal with `PolynomialQuotientRing_field`.

The original `C` is kept if it is immutable which is the way to go from the point of view of the constructor. If you want to avoid the copy in your function, make the matrix argument immutable first...

I know that by reading your code. From my point of view, the classes are only for `vector_space()` method or at least used only internally.

Is your code just a common idiom in Sage when an argument for a constructor is a matrix, which could be mutable (so that the code is required as a convention)?

For now, the class is only built with `vector_space` but nobody knows the future. If you feel better with

```
assert C.is_immutable()
```
It is also fine for me.

Ok. I see your motivation now. Then I would set the matrix `C` immutable in `vector_sapce` to prevent the copying.

I left a stupid comment

```
# from_V
# needs C
```
in `maps_finite_field.py`

If this ticket is duplicating some features of what used to be implemented in linear code, then some appropriate deprecation has to be done (possibly in later ticket but please do create them)
