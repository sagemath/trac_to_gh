1. Cython gets confused if we redefine `object`. This is an upstream bug https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2096 but it looks safer anyway to not redefine `object`.

2. `__len__` special functions must return an integer.

3. `list.index(x)` doesn't work if `x` is declared as a specific type, see https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2097 This breaks the `continued_fraction_list` method of `number_field_element_quadratic.pyx` where `x` is typed as `NumberFieldElement_quadratic`. However, the typing is not used, so it is actually a pessimization and it's best to removing the typing anyway.

4. In `__richcmp__`, Cython now assumes that `self` is an instance of the class where the method is defined.  This means that assigning `self` may break if `self` is assigned to an object of a different type.
