Sometimes, especially with functions of 8 variables, the method `BooleanFunction.truth_table(format='hex")` returns incorrect values that are also too long.

Example:

```
sage: from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
sage: from sage.crypto.boolean_function import BooleanFunction
sage: hex_str = "0123456789112345678921234567893123456789412345678951234567896123"
sage: len(hex_str)
64
sage: bf = BooleanFunction(hex_str)
sage: bf.nvariables()
8
sage: bf_tt_hex = bf.truth_table(format="hex")
sage: bf_tt_hex
'123456789112345678921234567893123456789412345670123456789112345678921234567893123456789412345678951234567896123'
sage: len(bf_tt_hex)
111
sage: S = ZZ(bf.truth_table(), 2).str(16)
sage: padding = "0" * ((1 << (bf.nvariables() - 2)) - len(S))
sage: tt_hex = padding + S
sage: tt_hex
'0123456789112345678921234567893123456789412345678951234567896123'
sage: len(tt_hex)
64
```

The example also shows how the code in  https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx lines 566 to 576 should be fixed. A suggested patch is attached. 

The example can also be used as the basis for a test case once the patch has been applied.

As far as I can tell, I have pushed my recommended changes to the branch u/pleopardi/fix_boolean_function_truth_table_hex

This is the first time I have created a branch in trac, so I may have made a mistake that I'm not aware of.
