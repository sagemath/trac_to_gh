lcalc is specifically good for finding zeros on the critical line. And this text from the quoted page does not sound promising:

> Beware that real_roots.c just uses brute force interval subdivision to prove that no real roots are missed. This gets very slow for modestly large q and/or t (note that 6475 function evaluations were needed to search [−10,10] even though there are only 6 sign changes). There are far more efficient ways (e.g. Turing's method) to provably locate zeros of L-functions and also make sure that there are no zeros off the critical line, which might be implemented in Arb in the future. A relatively simple improvement would be to use Taylor polynomials.

I have a feature request by the way for arb: support arbitrary L-functions instead of only Dirichlet L-functions.

The `lfun` package of PARI/GP has support for a wide range of L-functions and it would be nice if one could feed the data from PARI/GP to arb to do calculations. Of course, one would need to figure out which kind of data are needed to represent an L-function.

My limited understanding is that it's very hard to guarantee anything for general L-functions, but you might be able to do something conditional upon the user providing some assertions about the input (bounds on coefficients, etc.).
