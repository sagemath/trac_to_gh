The syntax

```
options=GlobalOptions(...
    doc="""
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: #doctest here
    """
)
```
has the unfortunate effect that the doctests are not actually seen as doctests. They are just a string, nothing more. Ticket #23238 was created to allow a new syntax for `GlobalOptions`, which makes the doctests actually doctests.

This ticket uses the new syntax in all cases. This enables some doctests which were not tested before. As expected, this uncovered various failures. Some trivial ones are fixed, others are marked as `# known bug` with the following tickets opened: #24323, #24324, #24325. #24326
