Not sure. What about the similar
- `GF(4, 'a')['a']`
- `QuadraticField(3, 'b')['b']`
- and the completely broken `SR['x']` (the symbol x is an element of SR)

You want to recursively look at the list of generator names in base rings when constructing a polynomial ring? You can not exclude base rings with infinitely many generators (like SR).
