What do you think should be the correct answer? My view is that the creation of the second polynomial ring should raise an exception already.

Not sure. What about the similar
- `GF(4, 'a')['a']`
- `QuadraticField(3, 'b')['b']`
- and the completely broken `SR['x']` (the symbol x is an element of SR)

You want to recursively look at the list of generator names in base rings when constructing a polynomial ring? You can not exclude base rings with infinitely many generators (like SR).
