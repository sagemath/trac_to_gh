This is a discussion ticket for improving the bliss canonical form input, based on https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/oZ7Uu5jTR9k/discussion.

Christian's aim: make the canonical form of a graph given by an integer matrix much faster.

This basic idea is to provide an alternative version of `sage.graphs.bliss.canonical_form` using a list of labelled edges as input rather than a graph. Maybe

```
def canonical_form_list(Vnr, edges, partition)
```
where we assume that (i,j,color) in edges has the property `0 <= i,j < Vnr` and colors `0 <= color < k` where the color `0` means "uncolored" and is assumed to be the most common color.

Since this is an internal speed-critial functionality, Christian believes that it would then be the user's responsibility to turn any input format of graph, if needed, into this format.

As Dima pointed out, we can turn this edge labelled graph into an unlabelled graph with O(Vnr log k) vertices as described in Sect 14 in http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Guide.html.

For now, this is only for discussion design and code snippets.

I have provided a first almost trivial version, I will send some timings later -- comparing the hash I posted on sage-support with its new counterpart using this new bliss canonical form (yielding the very same hash without ever constructing a sage `DiGraph`) gives immediately

But since it is not far from that, I now plan to implement what Dima pointed out from Sect 14 in ​http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Guide.html.

My impression is that, given that I need to know the number of vertices of the graph a priori, I need to first read the complete matrix before I can start creating the `bliss Digraph`.

That would be unfortunate. In that case, I suppose it will be impossible to avoid the creation of an intermediate edge list --- but you could create it by means of two `int*` (i.e., a C list for start points and a C list for end points). That might be a more efficient intermediate data structure than a python list of pairs.",

> My impression is that, given that I need to know the number of vertices of the graph a priori, I need to first read the complete matrix before I can start creating the `bliss Digraph`.


Hm. That would be unfortunate. In that case, I suppose it will be impossible to avoid the creation of an intermediate edge list --- but you could create it by means of two `int*` (i.e., a C list for start points and a C list for end points). That might be a more efficient intermediate data structure than a python list of pairs.

Independent of the matrix version, I think it would be overall nice to have

* the version I provided for a list of unlabelled edges (I think I should add a flag whether its directed or undirected), and

* a version for labelled edges, that are first turned into an equivalent version for undirected edges and then passed to the first

what I could actually do is to overestimate the number of vertices in the first place (given the matrix is size nxm, there are at most nm/2 edges, so even if all had the different labellings, I could go with log(mn/2)+max(n,m) many vertices, which is for m,n <= 20 still very small) and then possibly have chosen a few ununsed vertices floating around...

I pushed a first hopefully working version of the edge labelled bliss graph as described in Dima's reference.

Example:

```
sage: from sage.graphs.bliss import canonical_form_from_edge_list
sage: Vout = [0,0,1,2,2,3,3]; Vin = [0,1,2,0,3,0,2]; labels = [2,0,2,1,1,1,0]
sage: canonical_form_from_edge_list(4,Vout,Vin,3,labels, directed=False, certificate=True)

sage: Vout = [0,0,1,1]; Vin = [1,2,0,2]; labels = [0,1,0,1]
sage: canonical_form_from_edge_list(3,Vout,Vin,2,labels, directed=False, certificate=True)
```

* Could you please have a look and see if it works as desired
* Please in particular check that the vertex coloring scheme is correct

Once that is settled, I would also need help in improving (speeding) the code as much as easily possible, I already use three lists `Vout`, `Vin`, and `labels` which probably could be turned into c arrays instead...

(The current version does not provide the automorphism groups, but the methods `automorphism_group` and `automorphism_group_old` are captured to profile the bliss graph constructor from a labelled graph with Vnr*log(Lnr) vertices.

Here is some output:

```
sage: from sage.graphs.bliss import canonical_form, automorphism_group, automorphism_group_old
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNM(1000,1000000)
```
and then

```
sage: %crun automorphism_group(G)

What are these `automorphism_group_old` and other `*_old` functions?
It's still prototyping, right?

Regarding profiling, can't you use some kind of graphical tool, such as `google-pprof`, on `/home/stumpc5/.sage/temp/associahedron/20717/tmp_0m26KQ.perf` ?

Anyway, I think the bottlenecks correspond to larger values in the 2nd column, e.g. PyObject_RichCompare is 15% on the 1st listing and 21% on the 2nd listing.

Are you testing on the complete graph on purpose? (cause the number of edges is the square of the number of vertices, it's K_1000).

It would be interesting to look at how this performs on other graphs.

You can fing more details on the profiler (e.g. how to do per line profiles)
at the gperftools installation on your system. (I don't know why they don't have it online). (on linux, `man pprof` would give you more pointers).

> PyObject_RichCompare is 15% on the 1st listing and 21% on the 2nd listing.


I got rid of these by not using `.vertices` and `.edges` but instead the iterators. The `PyObject_RichCompare` were there because the vertices and edges were sorted by default.

>  Are you testing on the complete graph on purpose?


I was testing on many random graphs, and just ended up with the complete graph by pure chance.

I think the next optimization would be to use the internal graph structure on 0 ... Vnr-1 directly without first getting the edges as python objects and then turning them back into a bliss graph. But I don't plan to do this.

To summarize the situation: the new functionality for edge labelled graphs is up and working, and as quick as the old implementation on unlabelled graphs. So this is ready for review. I still see possible improvements using the cgraph structure, but leave this open for now.

Thanks. How about more docs for this function? E.g. it's unclear how the partition parameter interacts with vertex colours of the graph.
Docs need not be very formal, it's OK to move some tests into Examples section, and 
use them to illustrate the way the function works, e.g.

```
EXAMPLES:

`EXAMPLES::` -> `EXAMPLES:`

(only put `::` after EXAMPLES/TESTS is there is no subitems ending (by right) with `::`)

And, once again, can we please have an explanation/test/example of what happens is the vertex partitions of the graph (from its vertex labelling) and the partition supplied as the parameter are not compatible (I expect it would work with a common refinement, but one has to make sure, that's a corner where bugs would nest...).

It currently looks like

```
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.graphs.bliss import automorphism_group                  # optional - bliss

    Computing the automorphism group of a graph or digraph::

        sage: G = graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([1,1,1,2])                   # optional - bliss
```
Don't I need to put the `::` because of the following indented line?

I do not understand your other issue (and thought it was a typo and you meant edge coloring): What do you mean by vertex labelling?

* The vertex labelling must be injective if I see it correctly:

```
sage: G = Graph(graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([1,1,1,3]),sparse=True)
sage: G.relabel({0:"A",1:"A",2:"B"})
...
NotImplementedError: Non injective relabeling
```
* Any vertex labelling is completely ignored when it comes to the automorphism group, EXCEPT that the permutation group is built such that it acts on the vertex labels (see the last two doctests).

Am I missunderstanding what you mean?

Regarding `::`, you are correct, I didn't think straight. 

Then, I meant loops:

```
sage: gg=graphs.CompleteGraph(3)
sage: gg.allow_loops(True)
sage: gg.add_edge((1,1))
sage: gg.automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(0,2)]
```
this is without bliss installed. That is, at least the default automorphisms code respects loops, but there seems to be neither docs nor tests for this.

Also, your branch should modify the default docs on automorphisms, for it currently says

```
   * "edge_labels" - default False, otherwise allows only
     permutations respecting edge labels. Note that this option is not
     supported if "algorithm="bliss""

```
---and so the last sentence should go.

there are more mentions of Bliss in `graphs/generic_graph.py` that should be modified, e.g. 

```
  if edge_labels and algorithm == 'bliss':

The default should be `edge_labels=True` if you ask me. But such a change should be
