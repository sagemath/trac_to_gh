#23781 introduced a regression that the symlink from `lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.dll.a` to `lib/libpython2.7.dll.a` is not created properly.

On Python 3 this "config" directory name is formatted "config-<PYTHON_LDVERSION>" whereas on Python 2 it should be just "config".

This prevents extension modules from linking to the correct libpython2.7 on Cygwin.

Yes and no : fpylll compiles, but Sage does not build. I get an error at Sagelib's compilation :

I *think* I'm bitten by #24192, which I'll try next. But, as far as I understand, that implies restarting with `make distclean`. That will be long.

`positive review` on this ticket as well as for #24197, which turns out to be a buplicate.

I don't think you need to do a `make distclean` but it will require rebuilding all of the sage library at least.
