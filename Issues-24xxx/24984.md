and where does one ask for V[0]?

I'd rather apply `list()` to an iterator; e.g. wouldn't this (from comment 2) work in python3?

```
    if clique_partition:
        lines = map(lambda x: filter(lambda t: t[0]+x*t[1]==0, V),
                     filter(lambda z: z != 0, Fq))
        return (G, list(lines), v0)
```

In principle, vanilla-sage 8.2.b8 should build and start with python3. Instructions:
(in a separate clone of the git repo)

```
make configure
./configure --with-python=3
make build
```

Give it a try of you can.

<a id='comment:15'></a>this does not look like a right change 

```
-        lines = map(lambda x: filter(lambda t: t[0]+x*t[1]==0, V),
-                     filter(lambda z: z != 0, Fq))
+        lines = [[t for t in V if t[0] + z * t[1] == 0]
+                 for z in Fq if z]
```
`x` from `V` is gone and replaced by `z` from `Fq` in `t[0]+x*t[1]==0`.

This is why I'd rather retain all the filters, you know...

<a id='comment:18'></a>This ticket has no urgency, and I like the branch as it is. Please take a rest, a nap, or a good night sleep. We will look at that later.

EDIT: I have double-checked my changes after `if clique_partition:`, and I think that they are correct.

It's not "code vandalism".  Currently the changes Frédéric has made here is just replacing some code with the exact equivalent (on Python 2) code that also works on Python 3.
