Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A10):

and where does one ask for V[0]?

I'd rather apply `list()` to an iterator; e.g. wouldn't this (from comment 2) work in python3?

```
    if clique_partition:
        lines = map(lambda x: filter(lambda t: t[0]+x*t[1]==0, V),
                     filter(lambda z: z != 0, Fq))
        return (G, list(lines), v0)
```

after the branch here, one does not longer ask for V[0]. Before, one did

In principle, vanilla-sage 8.2.b8 should build and start with python3. Instructions:
(in a separate clone of the git repo)

```
make configure
./configure --with-python=3
make build
```

Give it a try of you can.

```
-        lines = map(lambda x: filter(lambda t: t[0]+x*t[1]==0, V),
-                     filter(lambda z: z != 0, Fq))
+        lines = [[t for t in V if t[0] + z * t[1] == 0]
+                 for z in Fq if z]
```
`x` from `V` is gone and replaced by `z` from `Fq` in `t[0]+x*t[1]==0`.

This is why I'd rather retain all the filters, you know...

It's not "code vandalism".  Currently the changes Frédéric has made here is just replacing some code with the exact equivalent (on Python 2) code that also works on Python 3.  If you believe these algorithms can be improved by the use of iterators you're welcome to take a stab at it, but as currently written that is not the case.
