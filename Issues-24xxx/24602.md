1.15 was released last year. It fixes a bug in 1.14 that can be seen while building Sage on SPARC Solaris 11.

The update is trivial to do.

Apologies for the weird patchbot results on this ticket. I'm experimenting with a new update to the patchbot to allow it to test tickets with spkg updates, and I sort of at random picked this one as a guinea pig.
