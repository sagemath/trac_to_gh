It is natural to see a homset with domain == codomain as a monoid. With that in mind, homsets should have a `one()` method aliasing `identity()`.

Currently, `homset.one()` simply calls `homset(1)` which happens to do the right thing in some cases (rings with a single generator `1` or matrices). Still, these previously-working-by-accident cases are broken unless comparison of morphisms is fixed: see #24281 for that.

Depends on #24281

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

The product of ring morphisms failure comes from this difference:

```
sage: H = Hom(QQ, QQ, category = Rings())
sage: psi = H.an_element()
sage: I = H.identity()
sage: psi * I
Composite map:
  From: Rational Field
  To:   Rational Field
  Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Rational Field
        then
          Ring endomorphism of Rational Field
          Defn: 1 |--> 1

sage: I * psi
Ring endomorphism of Rational Field
  Defn: 1 |--> 1
```
This could be fixed by adding another check for `IdentityMorphism` in the `RingHomomorphism._composition_` method.

I think the solution to the other two failures is to implement a `matrix` in the formal composite map that takes the appropriate product of matrices of the composite maps.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A4):
> The product of ring morphisms failure comes from this difference:

I think that this is the real issue:

```
sage: H = End(QQ)
sage: H(1) == H.identity()
False
```

> This could be fixed by adding another check for `IdentityMorphism` in the `RingHomomorphism._composition_` method.

True, but I see that as a different issue.
