See the following example:

```
sage: 0 <= x <= 1/2
0 <= x
```

This should raise an error. Note that it can create confusion when used in assumptions:

```
sage: assume(0 <= x <= 1/2)
sage: bool(x <= 1/2)
False
```

This has been reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41061/piecewise-defined-function-via-def).

<a id='comment:1'></a>This is not a solvable problem. The problem is that Python treats

```
0 <= x <= 1/2
```
as

```
(0 <= x) and (x <= 1/2)
```
Since `bool(0 <= x)` is `False`, this returns `(0 <= x)`.

There is proposal at [PEP 535](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0535/) to fix this, but it's not clear whether it will be accepted.

Why special-case `assume`? The problem already occurs before calling `assume`:

```
sage: 0 <= x <= 1/2
0 <= x
```
