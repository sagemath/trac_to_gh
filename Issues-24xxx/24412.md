LGTM. I wonder though why you chose to introduce separate `..._inc()` methods for incomplete elliptic integrals rather than having two-argument variants of `elliptic_e()` and `elliptic_pi()`.

This would have been inconvenient as the incomplete function has an extra argument (the point up to which you integrate).

I don't understand. I was thinking of something similar to

```

        Return the image of this ball by the Euler Gamma function (if
        ``z = None``) or the incomplete Gamma function (otherwise).
