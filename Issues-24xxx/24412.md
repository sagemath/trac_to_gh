I don't understand. I was thinking of something similar to

```

        Return the image of this ball by the Euler Gamma function (if
        ``z = None``) or the incomplete Gamma function (otherwise).

Indeed, that would have been a solution. On the plus side: less methods. On the minus side: less consistent with arb names... I don't have a strong opinion.
