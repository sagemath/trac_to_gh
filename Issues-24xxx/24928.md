`[-oo]`, `[+oo]` and `[-oo,+oo]` are three very different intervals. Though Sage is ignoring the difference between the first two in printing

```
sage: a = RBF(-infinity)
sage: b = RBF(+infinity)
sage: a
[+/- inf]
sage: b
[+/- inf]
```
Even though they are different

```
sage: a.endpoints()
(-infinity, -infinity)
sage: b.endpoints()
(+infinity, +infinity)
```

For the last interval `[-oo,+oo]` the following should work but does not

```
sage: RBF([-infinity,infinity])
nan
sage: RBF([-infinity,infinity]).endpoints()
(NaN, NaN)
```

`@`Fredrik: is the printing of arb infinities intentional? Shouldn't `[-oo ± c]`, `[+oo ± c]` and `[c ± oo]` be printed differently?
