```
Because of

```
sage: SR.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ['x'])
True
```
the conversion `ZZ['x'] -> SR['x']` goes through the base ring. As a consequence integral polynomials are badly converted into symbolic polynomials (and not into polynomial with symbolic coefficients)

```
sage: p = (polygen(ZZ)^2 + 1).change_ring(SR)
sage: p.constant_coefficient()
x^2 + 1
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

One option would be to disallow the coercion `ZZ['x'] -> SR` (but keeping the conversion). Such change is non-backward compatible because of the two following use cases

- `SR('x') * polygen(ZZ)` would become a polynomial in `SR['x']` (with coefficient `x`) (and not anymore the expression `x^2`)
- substitutions with polynomial values will not be possible anymore. The following example

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: R.<y0, y1> = ZZ[]
sage: x.subs(x=y0/y1)
y0/y1
```
   will give

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: R.<y0, y1> = ZZ[]
sage: x.subs(x=y0/y1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Fraction Field of
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y0, y1 over Integer Ring
to Symbolic Ring
```

It looks like the degree 0 result is consistent with how name ambiguities are resolved elsewhere:

```
sage: f=QQ['x']['x'](QQ['x'].0)
sage: f.degree()
0
```
There is an `x` in `SR`, `SR` is supposed to be a ring, so `ZZ` coerces into it. As a result, `ZZ['x']` coerces into it as well. Furthermore, that means that `ZZ['x']` coerces as constants into `SR['x']`.
