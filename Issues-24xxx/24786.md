Erik, could you please post on sage-devel some kind of report of your progress on python3 ? In particular, I would like to know how far we still are 

(0) from sage starting (almost there, I think it may just need #24728),

(1) from being able to build the doc (#24774 and then ?),

(2) from having a functional doctest framework (#24343 and what else ?).

And what are the involved tickets for each of these objectives ? I must say that I am a bit lost in your recent flurry of activity. I would like to put some priority between all these tickets.

That's fair--I've been thinking about that myself.  I almost feel like we need some kind of status board for Python 3.  I'll see what I can come up with.

As for the "recent flurry of activity" almost all of this is work I did some time ago but never got around to organizing into comprehensible discrete tickets.

The PR to brial did need review, but this is done now.  

What we need to do now is either add this patch to Sage, or release a new version of brial and update Sage to use it (preferably the latter).  But let's wait to see if I can identify any more Python 3 bugs in brial (I don't think there are but it's feasible).

Hello Erik, and welcome back.

Well, I think we should upgrade brial, indeed. Either here or in another ticket.

Maybe Pynac upgrade is more important than this one for being able to make the doc.
