Erik, could you please post on sage-devel some kind of report of your progress on python3 ? In particular, I would like to know how far we still are 

(0) from sage starting (almost there, I think it may just need #24728),

(1) from being able to build the doc (#24774 and then ?),

(2) from having a functional doctest framework (#24343 and what else ?).

And what are the involved tickets for each of these objectives ? I must say that I am a bit lost in your recent flurry of activity. I would like to put some priority between all these tickets.

That's fair--I've been thinking about that myself.  I almost feel like we need some kind of status board for Python 3.  I'll see what I can come up with.
