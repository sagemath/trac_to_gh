Erik, could you please post on sage-devel some kind of report of your progress on python3 ? In particular, I would like to know how far we still are 

(0) from sage starting (almost there, I think it may just need #24728),

(1) from being able to build the doc (#24774 and then ?),

(2) from having a functional doctest framework (#24343 and what else ?).

And what are the involved tickets for each of these objectives ? I must say that I am a bit lost in your recent flurry of activity. I would like to put some priority between all these tickets.

I can release a new brial when you think it is ready. The main reason I have that power on the brial repo is to be able to do releases for sage in a timely fashion. Although I also did quite a bit of clean up with the help of other sage-on-distro maintainers in the last few months.

Hello Erik, and welcome back.

Well, I think we should upgrade brial, indeed. Either here or in another ticket.

Maybe Pynac upgrade is more important than this one for being able to make the doc.
