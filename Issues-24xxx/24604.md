In a systematic search the following cases were found:

```
sage: arctan2(7,CDF(.92))
arctan2(7, 0.92)
sage: arctan2(7,CBF(.92))
arctan2(7, [0.9200000000000000 +/- 4.00e-17])
sage: elliptic_eu(7, CIF(1.7))
elliptic_eu(7, 1.7000000000000000?)
sage: elliptic_eu(7, complex(1.7))
elliptic_eu(7, (1.7+0j))
sage: jacobi_am(7, CIF(1.7))
jacobi_am(7, 1.7000000000000000?)
sage: jacobi_am(7, complex(1.7))
jacobi_am(7, (1.7+0j))
```
The systematic test will be committed with #24299.
