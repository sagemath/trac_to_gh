```
Also fix the following:

```
sage: NF.<a> = QuadraticField(-2)
sage: CIF(a)
...
ValueError: can not convert complex algebraic number to real interval
```

We also deal with Python 3 compatibility regarding `int`/`long` and `bytes`/`unicode`.

Not sure... I wanted to wait until the dependencies are merged before continuing with this.

It should be *mostly* done though. If it passes doctests, it might as well be "needs review".

- I know this is slightly outside the purview of this ticket, but perhaps we can rename `ComplexIntervalField_class` to `ComplexIntervalField` and have it inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` in order to get rid of the custom caching. I can also do this if you want.
- I would do the same for `RealIntervalField_class` except it is an extension class. Do you think there is a benefit for that? We don't even do that for `Rationals`.
- Why not use ``@`cached_method` for `real_field`, `middle_field`, etc.? They to have `UniqueRepresentation`-like behavior, so do not strictly need to be cached. However, I am assuming they are cached for speed reasons, so doing ``@`cached_method` is the best for repeated use:

  }}}
- Is the `_real_field = real_field` leftover from testing? I think it should be removed altogether.
- You should replace
  {{{#!diff
        return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, x, im, **kwds)
        return self.element_class(self, x, im, **kwds)
  }}}
  (in fact, if that is used elsewhere in the file, it should be replaced as well) to pick up the category contributions.
- Same comment for returning `RealIntervalFieldElement`.
- Similarly, I would also make this change:
  {{{#!diff
     R = RealIntervalField(prec=max(bits+pad, min_prec))
     if upper is not None:
         s = (s, upper)
-    return RealIntervalFieldElement(R, s, base)
+    return R.element_class(R, s, base)
 }}}

I think it looks good otherwise.

<a id='comment:48'></a>Thank you for doing the cleanup.

For changes such as

```diff
-        cdef ComplexIntervalFieldElement res = self._new()
+        res = self._new()
```
aren't we loosing some efficiency? I would think because they are still subclasses of `ComplexIntervalFieldElement`, that Cython would be able to optimize their attribute lookups by not treating them as Python objects? (Of course, we would have to explicitly cast `<ComplexIntervalFieldElement>` to avoid the type-checking-safety-penalty.)

This goes through the `__call__` (which in this case, bypasses the coercion framework, but normally it wouldn't):

```diff
-        return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, 0, 1)
+        return self(0, 1)
```
I think we are better making a direct call to `self.element_class(self, 0, 1)` since this is not user input.

No, Cython has type inference. Since `_new` is declared as returning a `ComplexIntervalFieldElement`, the declaration `cdef ComplexIntervalFieldElement res` is just redundant.

I don't see the problem with using `__call__` here but I can make that change.

Actually, the relevant attributes are `cdef` attributes, so they cannot even be accessed from Python! So the fact that the code works proves that Cython must be doing type inference.

I changed some `self(...)` calls to `self.element_class(self, ...)`

That is what is happening, e.g.:

```C
  __pyx_t_1 = ((PyObject *)__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_16complex_interval_27ComplexIntervalFieldE
lement__new(__pyx_v_self)); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_1)) __PYX_ERR(0, 325, __pyx_L1_error)
  __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_1);
  __pyx_v_a00 = ((struct __pyx_obj_4sage_5rings_16complex_interval_ComplexIntervalFieldEle
ment *)__pyx_t_1);
  __pyx_t_1 = 0;
```
I didn't realize that Cython was that smart. :)

Thank you. LGTM. (If I wanted to be **really** picky, I would say `self.element_class(self, 1)` should instead use the cached `self.one()`, but `zeta(1)` is almost certainly never called.)
