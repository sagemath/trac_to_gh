I can see why this was done and this is certainly a nice idea but I am not sure it warrants this package in Sage. The `configure` file is generated, so shouldn't we just trust a recent version of autotools and try to make our changes to `configure.in` small?

Anyway, the autotools SPKG does not build for me. I can not remove the offending versions of automake because the `./spkg-write-makefile` script needs the autotools SPKG to be installed already.

It appears that Perl has changed how it handles unescaped braces, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43165604/unescaped-left-brace-regex-error. This used to be deprecated and probably it's an error now. My perl is 5.26.1 (archlinux.)

I'll try to install an old perl and drop the problematic versions of automake.

The issue is fixed in automake since this commit which is in 1.15.1+.

```
commit 13f00eb4493c217269b76614759e452d8302955e
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 31 16:35:29 2016 -0700

    automake: port to Perl 5.22 and later
    
    Without this change, Perl 5.22 complains "Unescaped left brace in
    regex is deprecated" and this is planned to become a hard error in
    Perl 5.26.  See:
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-5.22.0/pod/perldelta.pod#A_literal_%22{%22_should_now_be_escaped_in_a_pattern
    * bin/automake.in (substitute_ac_subst_variables): Escape left brace.
```

So that means that everything between 1.10 and 1.15 is affected.

mkoeppe: What should we do now?

1. Drop the affected versions? (that's the easiest I think)
2. Just package recent versions as you proposed earlier.
3. Package none at all, and just expect SPKG developers to have recent autotools (I think that's better than 2 actually.)
4. Cherry-pick the fixing commit into every tag and make this SPKG more complicated than it is already.
5. ?

the original purpose of this package is to provide some autotool version in situations where there is none, e.g. on OSX. 

building autotools from scratch is not very straightforward, e.g. I recall needing once to build a newer m4 to build it, etc etc.

I think it either should be dropped or fixed to work on all platforms.

I guess we might need a vote on sage-devel in order to drop it.

I don't know whether it is available with either of them, what is known is that neither of them work with Sage.

That is, building/running Sage in either of these environments does not work.

Yes, probably one can run Sage's ./bootstrap
in either of them, then uninstall them and proceed with building Sage :-)

I don't have OSX here but why would Sage not build if conda's autotools are on the path? At least at conda-forge's https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/ we do not do any autools related patching as far as I know.

That sounds like it would be a quite annoying workflow. But you would only have to do that when you change configure.ac and such, right?
