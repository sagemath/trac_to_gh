Minimal crashing example:

```
#include <complex>
auto inf = 1.0 / std::complex<double>();
```

The underlying reason is that, in #24353, the MPC upgrade **did not change** the `.so` version number but the MPFR upgrade **did change** the `.so` version number. So now GCC is linking with the old MPFR but the new MPC which is what causes the breakage...

Because gcc links to mpfr/mpc and there is a change of soname from mpfr (so.4 to so.6) gcc needs to be rebuilt. Currently mpfr is only a built order dependency because there wasn't  a change in soname for a long time it was fine. But it looks like this need to be changed.

mpfr doesn't depend on gcc

```
cat build/pkgs/mpfr/dependencies 
$(MP_LIBRARY)

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.
```
but gcc does depend on mpfr - but only build order dependency, that is gcc is not rebuilt after an mpfr upgrade (which is fine as long as the soname doesn't change either)

```
cat build/pkgs/gcc/dependencies 
| $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc zlib xz

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.
```
Same thing for `MP_LIBRARY`, `mpc` and `zlib` really. `xz` is only needed to unpack the tarball.

It seems -O3 is needed for the ICE. What I did:

```
> make distclean
> git checkout 8.2.beta3
> ./sage -f mpfr
> ./sage -f gcc
> git checkout 8.2.beta4
> ./sage -f giac
```
As expected this fails again with the same error. Then I put the snippet into `t.cpp` and did `./local/bin/g++ -c -O3 t.cpp` which also fails.
