This is wrong (see `src/sage/categories/primer.py`):

```
For plain Python methods, one can also just ask in which module they
are implemented::

    sage: i._pow_.__module__
    'sage.categories.semigroups'

    sage: pQ._mul_.__module__
    'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic'
    sage: pQ._pow_.__module__
    'sage.categories.semigroups'

We see that integers and polynomials have each their own
multiplication method: the multiplication algorithms are indeed
unrelated and deeply tied to their respective datastructures. On the
other hand, as we have seen above, they share the same powering method
because the set `\ZZ` of integers, and the set `\QQ[x]` of
polynomials are both semigroups. Namely, the class for integers and
the class for polynomials both derive from an *abstract class* for
semigroup elements, which factors out the *generic* methods like
``_pow_``. This illustrates the use of *hierarchy of classes* to share
common code between classes having common behaviour.
```

The problem is that powering is not implemented using the `_pow_` method. It just happens that semigroups implement `_pow_` for unclear reasons. Everything involving powering will change in #24247, so these doctests will be broken. But already the explanation is wrong now, so it should be fixed. Preferably a different method should be used instead of `_pow_` to explain generic methods.

There are some other references to `__pow__` and `_pow_` in that file, but those others can easily be fixed in #24247.
