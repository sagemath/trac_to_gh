As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/dZwxUCNEZWk/joIzOT0aBAAJ the pickle jar no longer serves the purpose that it was created for. So better remove it, as it is currently only an obstacle to development.

I am only removing the pickle jar itself and the related tests and documentation. The functions `picklejar()` and `unpickle_all()` which deal with the pickle jar are kept for now, in case that somebody wants to reboot (hopefully a better version of) the pickle jar.

Now that this is gone, perhaps we could deprecate and/or remove the `sage.misc.explain_pickle` module.  It's a nice utility for debugging pickling issues, but less relevant if we're no longer going to guarantee pickle preservation between versions.

It's still relevant for debugging pickling issues within one Sage version I suppose.
