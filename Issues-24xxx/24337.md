As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/dZwxUCNEZWk/joIzOT0aBAAJ the pickle jar no longer serves the purpose that it was created for. So better remove it, as it is currently only an obstacle to development.

I am only removing the pickle jar itself and the related tests and documentation. The functions `picklejar()` and `unpickle_all()` which deal with the pickle jar are kept for now, in case that somebody wants to reboot (hopefully a better version of) the pickle jar.

It's still relevant for debugging pickling issues within one Sage version I suppose.
