Why would the assembler interfere with the compilation of `pow()`? That makes no sense to me.

<a id='comment:7'></a>There is some kind of caching involved. I just logged in, and (with Solaris `ld`, whether it's relevant or not), it worked:

```
// t.cc
#include <cmath>
int main()
{
// using namespace std;
int i,j,k;
i = 2;
j = 10;
k = pow(i,j);
return k;
}
```
and `g++ t.cc` worked.

But then

```
$ PATH=/opt/csw/gnu:$PATH ld --version
GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.24
...
$ PATH=/opt/csw/gnu:$PATH g++ t.cc
t.cc: In function ‘int main()’:
t.cc:8:12: error: call of overloaded ‘pow(int&, int&)’ is ambiguous
...
```

And now going back to the correct linker does not help either.

Anyhow, I have managed to build Singular without any changes to the C++ source few times in row (it needed the linking fixes, but that's another story).

You try to compile the example above, and you manage, say, by adding `std::` to `pow`.
This get stored in ccache, and used by the compiler next time to compile the code without that `std::`...

<a id='comment:11'></a>Yes, sure, it does work (or `using namespace std;` works too). The real question is whether Singular is adhering to c++11 (or so) standard, or it relies on an old behaviour of C++ which is platform-dependent.

This error happens before linking. I really don't see how linking could have anything to do with it.

> coupled (perhaps) with ccache.


Are you explicitly using `ccache`? I don't think that it's enabled by default on that machine.

> This get stored in ccache, and used by the compiler next time to compile the code without that `std::`...


ccache wouldn't just ignore "`std::`". The sources with and without `std::` are obviously different.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I'm not using `ccache` globally, I'm using it as a Sage package. 

Note that the error messages  `...note: candidate: long double std::pow(...)`, so perhaps it'd willing to consider `int std::pow(...)` if it was in `ccache`.
And it could be that some tests I did where at Sage prompt, thus using `ccache`. (This is just a conjecture of course).
