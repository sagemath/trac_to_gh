Why would the assembler interfere with the compilation of `pow()`? That makes no sense to me.

There is some kind of caching involved. I just logged in, and (with Solaris `ld`, whether it's relevant or not), it worked:

```
// t.cc
#include <cmath>
int main()
{
// using namespace std;
int i,j,k;
i = 2;
j = 10;
k = pow(i,j);
return k;
}
```
and `g++ t.cc` worked.

But then

```
$ PATH=/opt/csw/gnu:$PATH ld --version
GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.24
...
$ PATH=/opt/csw/gnu:$PATH g++ t.cc
t.cc: In function ‘int main()’:
t.cc:8:12: error: call of overloaded ‘pow(int&, int&)’ is ambiguous
...
```

And now going back to the correct linker does not help either.

Anyhow, I have managed to build Singular without any changes to the C++ source few times in row (it needed the linking fixes, but that's another story).

One possible explanation is LTO optimisation, coupled (perhaps) with ccache.
You try to compile the example above, and you manage, say, by adding `std::` to `pow`.
This get stored in ccache, and used by the compiler next time to compile the code without that `std::`...

Yes, sure, it does work (or `using namespace std;` works too). The real question is whether Singular is adhering to c++11 (or so) standard, or it relies on an old behaviour of C++ which is platform-dependent.

This error happens before linking. I really don't see how linking could have anything to do with it.

> coupled (perhaps) with ccache.


Are you explicitly using `ccache`? I don't think that it's enabled by default on that machine.

> This get stored in ccache, and used by the compiler next time to compile the code without that `std::`...


ccache wouldn't just ignore "`std::`". The sources with and without `std::` are obviously different.

I'm not using `ccache` globally, I'm using it as a Sage package. 

Note that the error messages  `...note: candidate: long double std::pow(...)`, so perhaps it'd willing to consider `int std::pow(...)` if it was in `ccache`.
And it could be that some tests I did where at Sage prompt, thus using `ccache`. (This is just a conjecture of course).
