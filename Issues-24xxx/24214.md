Right. It is not completely unreasonable. However it has consequence for sage-on-distro, where the linbox maintainer may prefer to leave linbox "vanilla" instead of patching it the sage way. Is there an issue opened for the switching version or a branch open where I and my fellow sage-on-distro maintainer can follow progress on that work?

Confirmed. This seems to hang forever:

<a id='comment:54'></a>Ok, sorry, I got confused.
Indeed I removed this section from `fflas_ffpack/spkg-install` since the fix upstream now fixes it.
However, the `-fpermissive` flag was not exported to the `pkgconfig --cflags` list, hence LinBox did not see use it.
I pushed a patch in this branch and this is fixed upstream too.
