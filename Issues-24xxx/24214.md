All three libraries have been released.
The code in this ticket's branch works fine for me with these new releases.
I still need to do one cleanup pass on the spkg-install's and document SPKG.txt before opening it for review.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

Note for the reviewer: after some discussions, we (LinBox dev) decided not to merge the patch fixing #21579 and #15535 (replacing the probabilistic early terminated Chinese Remainder Algorithm for charpoly by a deterministic one) in the release and we therefore add the patch in sage.
This is because there was no consensus that  LinBox should default to the deterministic version of the algorithm.
We will rework the interface to allow a switch between the two variants, and the option to pass a bound on the probability of failure for the probabilistic algorithm, but meanwhile, the decision was to not change the default (probabilistic) in release 1.5.1.

Right. It is not completely unreasonable. However it has consequence for sage-on-distro, where the linbox maintainer may prefer to leave linbox "vanilla" instead of patching it the sage way. Is there an issue opened for the switching version or a branch open where I and my fellow sage-on-distro maintainer can follow progress on that work?

You introduced a TAB in `linbox_flint_interface.pyx`.

More dramatic, on the following doctests my computer get stuck and finally segfault

- `src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` line 1212 ([attachment: matrix_integer_dense.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket24214/matrix_integer_dense.log))

```
matrix([]).charpoly('y', 'linbox')
```
- `src/sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx` line 1034 ([attachment: matrix_rational_dense.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket24214/matrix_rational_dense.log))

```
for _ in range(100):
    dim = randint(0, 10)
    m = random_matrix(QQ, dim, num_bound=8, den_bound=8)
    p_flint = m.charpoly(algorithm='flint'); m._clear_cache()
    p_linbox = m.charpoly(algorithm='linbox'); m._clear_cache()
    p_generic = m.charpoly(algorithm='generic')
    assert p_flint == p_linbox == p_generic
```
- `src/sage/graphs/graph.py` line 7717  ([attachment: graph.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket24214/graph.log))

```
G = graphs.RandomTree(10)
G.ihara_zeta_function_inverse()
```


For each problematic file, the log is the output of `sage -t` (stdout+stderr).

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:29):
> I seem to be getting a consistent timeout on `src/sage/modular/modform/ambient.py`

Confirmed. This seems to hang forever:

```
sage: t = ModularForms(1, 512)._compute_hecke_matrix(5); t.charpoly()
```
Note: the matrix has size only 43x43 but it has very large coefficients.

Ok, sorry, I got confused.
Indeed I removed this section from `fflas_ffpack/spkg-install` since the fix upstream now fixes it.
However, the `-fpermissive` flag was not exported to the `pkgconfig --cflags` list, hence LinBox did not see use it.
I pushed a patch in this branch and this is fixed upstream too.
