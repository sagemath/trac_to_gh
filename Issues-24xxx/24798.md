`sagetex` can fail to build if SAGE_CHECK=yes due to missing dependencies

To reproduce:
`make distclean && make sagetex`

(An earlier version of this bug report dealt with issues building cypari and pycrypto if SAGE_CHECK=yes. These were fixed in #25813 and #25844, respectively.)

> `pycrypto` works for me without your patch.

Do you have system mpir or gmp installed? If I install the libgmp-dev package (on Debian Unstable) 

```
make distclean  && make pycrypto
```
passes. If I don't have it installed then testing fails with:

```

With my patch, testing succeeds for me even if system libgmp-dev is not installed.

You are right. pycrypto does require GMP/MPIR. But since it links against it, it should be a real dependency (on the left of the `|` symbol) instead of an order-only dependency (on the right of the `|` symbol).

How's the above for a solution for cypari and pycrypto?

In the latest beta `sagetex` (even with my patch) is failing with

```

It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.

I don't think that happened with 8.2.beta.6 and I haven't tried to find the cause yet. (As an aside, neither `scandir` nor `pathlib2` get pulled in as dependencies when doing make distclean && make sagetex.)

Dependencies updated for 8.4rc0:

Doing `make distclean && make sagetex` fails unless `kiwisolver`, `sympy`, `elliptic_curves` and `jmol` are installed.

`kiwisolver` should really get pulled in by `matplotlib`, not `sagetex`, so I've added it to `matplotlib`'s runtime dependencies (this got missed in #25702) and added to the rest to `sagetex`.

I tested with 8.4rc0 and confirmed that sagetex now builds with SAGE_CHECK=yes. I've also confirmed that adding any combination of three of the dependencies is not sufficient.
