`sagetex` can fail to build if SAGE_CHECK=yes due to missing dependencies

To reproduce:
`make distclean && make sagetex`

(An earlier version of this bug report dealt with issues building cypari and pycrypto if SAGE_CHECK=yes. These were fixed in #25813 and #25844, respectively.)

Depends on #24995

Do you have system mpir or gmp installed? If I install the libgmp-dev package (on Debian Unstable) 

```
make distclean  && make pycrypto
```
passes. If I don't have it installed then testing fails with:

```

```

With my patch, testing succeeds for me even if system libgmp-dev is not installed.

You are right. pycrypto does require GMP/MPIR. But since it links against it, it should be a real dependency (on the left of the `|` symbol) instead of an order-only dependency (on the right of the `|` symbol).

How's the above for a solution for cypari and pycrypto?

In the latest beta `sagetex` (even with my patch) is failing with

It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.

I don't think that happened with 8.2.beta.6 and I haven't tried to find the cause yet. (As an aside, neither `scandir` nor `pathlib2` get pulled in as dependencies when doing make distclean && make sagetex.)

Dependencies updated for 8.4rc0:

Doing `make distclean && make sagetex` fails unless `kiwisolver`, `sympy`, `elliptic_curves` and `jmol` are installed.

`kiwisolver` should really get pulled in by `matplotlib`, not `sagetex`, so I've added it to `matplotlib`'s runtime dependencies (this got missed in #25702) and added to the rest to `sagetex`.

I tested with 8.4rc0 and confirmed that sagetex now builds with SAGE_CHECK=yes. I've also confirmed that adding any combination of three of the dependencies is not sufficient.
