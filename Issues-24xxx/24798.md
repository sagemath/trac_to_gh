sagetex}}} can fail to build if SAGE_CHECK=yes due to missing dependencies

To reproduce:
{{{make distclean && make sagetex}}}

(An earlier version of this bug report dealt with issues building cypari and pycrypto if SAGE_CHECK=yes. These were fixed in #25813 and #25844, respectively.)

Do you have system mpir or gmp installed? If I install the libgmp-dev package (on Debian Unstable) 

```
make distclean  && make pycrypto
```
passes. If I don't have it installed then testing fails with:

```

With my patch, testing succeeds for me even if system libgmp-dev is not installed.

You are right. pycrypto does require GMP/MPIR. But since it links against it, it should be a real dependency (on the left of the `|` symbol) instead of an order-only dependency (on the right of the `|` symbol).

How's the above for a solution for cypari and pycrypto?

In the latest beta `sagetex` (even with my patch) is failing with

```
************************************************************************
It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.
