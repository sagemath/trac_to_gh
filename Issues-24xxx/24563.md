This is hard to reproduce reliably, but can happen if a worker process outlives its deadline and `w.kill()` is called, but the process has exited on its own by the time `killpg()` is called.

I've had this happen a few times on Cygwin where process shutdown tends to take a little longer.

No, I changed my mind. I'll do it the way you suggested.
