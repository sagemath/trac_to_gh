These tests passes because of changes in the digraph code (at least, I don't remember `view(Digraph([This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)))` working before 6.0) more by accident than intent:

However, it should work both with and without `dot2tex`, so I think it is okay to not change it.
