It would be nice to update our docker images automatically through continuous integration services. Of course it's good to have these images up-to-date without manual intervention but this is also convenient as a starting point for people who want to use CI for their own branches of Sage (besides the patchbot.)¹

This ticket proposes recipes for [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI and CircleCI to build our docker images automatically. On the respective websites, the CI can be configured to push automatically to the Docker Hub. A webhook (on github) updates the README on Docker Hub automatically.

I implemented this for both [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI and CircleCI. I think [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI is more relevant in the long  run, also it's open source and people can provision their own machines as runners. CircleCI at the same time works out of the box for Sage without private test runners and it also allows for easier debugging as you can logon to the machine running your tests with SSH. I tried to share most code between the two implementations.

See also https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images/issues/13 and https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/issues/3 for a followup (automatically provide jupyter notebooks for easier review.)

Here are some numbers and screenshots (click on the screenshots to go to the real pages):

### [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI

If I provision my own runner from Google Cloud with two threads, it takes about 5 hours to build Sage from scratch, run rudimentary tests on the docker images, and upload them to Docker Hub and GitLab's registry.

<img src="gitlab.png" width=640, center, link=https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines>

Recycling the build artifacts from the last run on the develop branch brings this down to about **??** minutes (on GitLab's free shared runners with two threads.) This roughly breaks down as:
* **32** minutes for `build-from-latest:
  * **10** minutes for the actual build (most of which is spent in the docbuild; caused by a known Sphinx bug to some extent)
  * **??** minutes are spent pulling the sagemath-dev image from Docker Hub (this usually goes away if you provision your own runners and expose the host's docker daemon by setting `DOCKER_HOST`.)
  * a few minutes running through all the fast stages of the Dockerfile.
  * a few minutes to push the resulting images to GitLab's registry. (using GitLab's `cache`, this could probably be improved, at least for runners that we provision ourselves.)
* **5** - **15** minutes for each test (run in parallel,); the relevant test is `test-dev.sh` which spents 6 minutes in the actual docbuild (just as in `build-from-latest`) and some 5 minutes to pull the sagemath-dev image from the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) registry. (That part should go away with a provisioned runner that exposes the host's docker daemon.)
* **??** minutes for the publishing to Docker Hub, most of which is spent pulling the images from the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) registry, and the other half pushing them to Docker Hub roughly. (Again, exposing the host's docker daemon would probably cut that time in half.)

With some tricks we could probably bring this down to 25 minutes (see CircleCI below) but we won't get this down to this without giving up on the CI being split up into different stages (as is for technical reasons necessary for CircleCI.) To go well below that, we would need to pull binary packages from somewhere…I don't see a sustainable way of doing this with the current SPKG system.

### CircleCI

It typically takes almost **5** hours to build Sage from scratch on CircleCI, run rudimentary tests on the docker images, and upload them to Docker Hub. 

<img src="circleci.png" width=640, center, link=https://circleci.com/gh/saraedum/workflows/sage>

Recycling the build artifacts from the last run on the develop branch brings this down to about **30** minutes usually. 5 minutes could be saved by not testing the `sagemath-dev` and probably another minute or two if we do not build it at all. To go significantly below 15 minutes is probably hard with the huge sage-the-distribution (7GB uncompressed/2GB compressed) that we have to pull every time at the moment.

<img src="circleci-rebuild.png" width=640, center, link=https://circleci.com/gh/saraedum/workflows/sage>

### Docker Hub

A push to github updates the README on the Docker Hub page. The current sizes are ![](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/sagemath/sagemath/latest.svg) and ![](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/sagemath/sagemath-dev/latest.svg); unfortunately MicroBadger is somewhat unstable so these numbers are incorrectly reported as 0 sometimes.

Here are some things that we need to test before merging this:

* [x] build-from-clean works in the sagemath namespace, building a tag on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab), https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines/25831229
* [x] build-from-clean works in the sagemath namespace, building from develop on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab), https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines/25831675
* [x] build-from-clean works in a user namespace on CircleCI, https://circleci.com/workflow-run/4ae6af8c-2212-4724-a865-a401be4bd8b7; this does not work reliably as it often times out after 5 hours. If we can manage to use more packages from the system, then we should be able to move this below CircleCI's time limit.
* [x] build-from-latest works and is fast in a user namespace on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab), https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines/25894653
* [x] build-from-latest works and is fast in a user namespace on CircleCI, https://circleci.com/workflow-run/5bad5fe0-f817-4174-b0b4-de7d1be3b01c

After this ticket has been merged, the following steps are necessary:

* ~~Setup an account for sagemath on Circle CI.~~
* Add Docker Hub credentials on ~~Circle CI or~~ [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab).

To see a demo of what the result looks like, go to https://hub.docker.com/r/sagemath/sagemath/. The CircleCI runs can be seen here https://circleci.com/gh/saraedum/sage, and the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI runs are here https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines.

¹: I want to run unit tests of an external Sage package, https://github.com/swewers/MCLF. Being able to build a custom docker image which contains some not-yet-merged tickets makes this much easier.

PS: Long-term one could imagine this to be the first step to replace the patchbot with a solution that we do not have to maintain so much ourselves, such as gitlab-runners. This is of course outside of the scope of this ticket but having a bunch of working CI files in our repository might inspire people to script some other tasks in a reproducible and standardized way.

-Recycling the build artifacts from the last run on the develop branch brings this down to less than 50 minutes. Much of the time is spent uploading the docker images. We could probably bring this down a bit by not uploading the `sagemath-dev` image on branches where it is not really useful.
+Recycling the build artifacts from the last run on the develop branch brings this down to less than 50 minutes. This roughly breaks down as:
+* 30 minutes for `build-from-latest`:
+  * 6 minutes for the actual build (most of which is spent in the docbuild)
+  * 10 minutes to copy the files locally for the `sagemath` and `sagemath-dev` image
+  * the rest of the time is split between pulling the `sagemath-dev` image from Docker Hub and pushing the `sagemath` image and the `sagemath-dev` image to [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) registry.
+* 3 - 10 minutes for each test (run in parallel,) much of which is spent in downloading the `sagemath` image from the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) registry.
+* 13 minutes for the publishing to Docker Hub, half of which is spent pulling the images from the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) registry, and the other half pushing them to Docker Hub roughly.
+
+With some tricks we could probably bring this down to 35 minutes (see CircleCI below) but we won't get this down to 25 without giving up on the CI being split up into different stages (as is for technical reasons necessary for CircleCI.) To go well below that, we would need to pull binary packages from somewhere…I don't see a sustainable way of doing this with the current SPKG system.

Julian walked me through this last week and it is very good stuff and I'm +1 on it.

My one concern is that by including the CI configuration files directly in the main Sage repo, it may be difficult to update things quickly if/when they break.  In the long term I'd much prefer it if Sage's 'master' branch were used more like other projects typically do, as a fast-moving development branch where we can easily push changes quickly if need be, particularly for the CI config, for which perhaps we could make a special dispensation.

In the meantime, perhaps the CI builds should be based on a "ci" branch of Sage which, most of the time, would just be kept up to date with `develop`, but that we could also commit to more frequently *if needed*.

Is this still needs_review, or should it be needs_work?

If we have it on a separate branch, how would I use it if I want it on my branch? Merge it in and then in the end force push a version without CI?\n\nMy point was that Sage's \"develop\" branch moves at a slow pace as it currently does, but we have a separate branch (synced regularly to the current \"develop\") that is allowed to move faster, more like how most projects use \"master\".\n\nSo it wouldn't just be for continuous integration.  That is, the CI stuff would still be in the main branch, but we would have a separate development branch from \"develop\" that can be a bit more agile, accept merge requests, etc.",

My point was that Sage's "develop" branch moves at a slow pace as it currently does, but we have a separate branch (synced regularly to the current "develop") that is allowed to move faster, more like how most projects use "master".

So it wouldn't just be for continuous integration.  That is, the CI stuff would still be in the main branch, but we would have a separate development branch from "develop" that can be a bit more agile, accept merge requests, etc.

Perhaps you can clarify something for me.  I'm reading the documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html and at https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html (just to better understand some aspects of this), and the documentation *starts out* saying "Install GitLab Runner, etc...".

(Not that we wouldn't want to be running our own runners anyways, but it would be disconcerting if that were necessary for this configuration to work properly at all).

Relatedly, I don't understand this comment at all:

```
# We use docker-in-docker to build our docker images.  It can be faster to
# expose your outer docker daemon by mounting /var/run/docker.sock to
# /var/run/docker.sock and setting DOCKER_HOST in Settings -> CI/CD -> Secret
# variable to unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

Why would you set `DOCKER_HOST` as a secret?

Forgive me if these are annoying questions--I'm just trying to understand how this all works so that I can continue to help with it in the future.

It looks like in the Dockerfile you've done away with the build for the `sagemath-jupyter` image.  I've always been somewhat split on my feelings about it, but I think in general it has been useful.  It's nice having an image whose default command is just the correct thing to start up the Notebook, because I've had users mess that up before and get confused (e.g. you have to make sure to pass `--ip='*'` and get the quoting right as well.

On a similar note, I was confused by the documentation for `.ci/test-jupyter.sh` where it reads:

```
# Usage: ./test-jupyter.sh sage-jupyter-image [host]
```

This gave me the impression that it should be used verbatim like `./test-jupyter.sh sage-jupyter-image`--as if there were actually an image called "sage-jupyter-image".  This might be clearer if it were documented in a more GNU-like style just as `./test-jupyter.sh IMAGE-NAME [HOST]`, making it clear that the first argument is the name (or hash for that matter) of some Docker image, not necessarily a *specific* image.

I haven't looked at how all the other scripts are documented yet, but I would do them similarly.

Environment variables that are injected into the scripts that are described in `.gitlab-ci.yml` are called secrets in [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab). They are not necessarily "secret". The `docker` docker image detects whether there is a host called `docker` and then assumes that this host is running `docker:dind` (or something similar.) You can disable this behaviour by explicitly setting `DOCKER_HOST`.

No worries at all. This is all a bit confusing.

Your comments are very much appreciated. I think it's easier for me to fix things as I work with these files all the time. But feel free to push your own changes of course.

Okay, thanks for clarifying the "secrets" thing.  That was definitely confusing me.

I still had to stare at this for a while though to understand what was meant.  In particular I didn't understand exactly what `services:` meant (now I do), and it was also unclear to me that `docker:dind` was just the name of a Docker image (where `dind` is the tag indicating the Docker-in-Docker image).

Not that I can think of.  It might be something to do with your environment.  The relevant line from the top-level `Makefile` is:

```
     $(MAKE) build/make/Makefile --stop
```

so you would get this error if the `$(MAKE)` variable were somehow set to empty.

Still confused about `sagemath-dev` even after re-reviewing.  The point of `sagemath-develop`, at least originally, was supposed to be more or less the same thing--it would be built from the latest `develop` branch *and* contain most/all build artifacts (and is hence a bit fatter than the normal `sagemath` image, by ~2GB).

In the Dockerfile section for `sagemath-dev` it has

```

I've usually found it convenient (even for the -devel image) to just start straight into the sage shell like `/home/sage/sage/sage -sh` or something.  But maybe for debugging purposes it's just a well not to.  I'm not sure.

In `pull-gitlab.sh` you have:

```
+# The variable $DOCKER_IMAGE is set to the full name of the pulled image;
+# source this script to use it.
```

that's rather awkward to me.  Perhaps this script could output the image name at the end (perhaps silencing the other commands, or piping them to stderr or something).  Or better still, maybe `DOCKER_IMAGE` could be set somewhere else, since the way it's pieced together in that script doesn't seem all that directly to the script itself.

(The general principle I'm going on with these scripts is that even though they're written for and used primarily by the CI systems, for testing and development purposes I'd rather they work in some "normal", unsurprising way as much as possible.)

I extended the section about docker:dind. Do you think that's enough? The section could go into the README but then again it's absolutely standard in the [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI world.

Thank you--that's much clearer now, I think.  I would still lean towards explaining this in the Readme, because what's bog standard in GitLab CI, I would think, is at this point virtually unknown to almost everyone else who works on Sage (including me).

Yes, I think you misunderstood that part. The dev images are about the build artifacts being intact. I don't discriminate branches (except for building from scratch for master/develop and building from develop's sagemath-dev image for everyone else.)

It breaks my existing incremental builds on other branches because they expect it to be called `commit`. I really don't mind renaming it though.

That's a fair point, but I still think `docker run -p <local-port>:<container-port> <image-name>` is easier to remember (I used to have to look up how `-p` works but not usually anymore) than `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8888:8888 sagemath/sagemath sage -notebook=jupyter --no-browser --ip='*' --port=8888`, which is definitely more than I can remember.

I agree about releases and non-releases having much of the same output, but in this case it's really just a convenience layer for casual users, who are mostly only going to be concerned about final releases.

No strong opinion for `sagemath-jupyter`. The docker command to start it (with port forwarding) can be reconstruted without doc lookup by someone who has some familiarity with docker. The full command requires both sagemath and jupyter familiarity.

Having a jupyter image explicitly bring attention that our image is "jupyter ready"; on the other hand, it may be confusing suggesting that our base image is not.

It's only an analogue in the sense that it contains the things that developers usually care about. I think that `-dev` is good for people who are randomly looking for a sagemath image on docker (and know about the nomenclature in Debian,…): with the `-dev` they should know immediately that that's not what they need. I don't mind `-build` but I don't find it as obvious in that regard.

Binder just runs the docker image with appropriate port forwarding,
and then launches in the container the command 'jupyter notebook' from
the path, with the port flag and a few others. At some stage, it was
instead calling directly the command `jupyter-notebook` but presumably
this is no more the case.

The specific requirements are there:

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dockerfile.html#preparing-your-dockerfile

Notes:

- We enforced the notebook=5 with with a pip install in our previous
  docker image. Since #24168, merged in 8.1, the notebook has been
  upgraded to v5, so the pip install should not be needed anymore.

- Items 4 and 5 do not apply to Sage's docker image; instead they are
  about the (essentially trivial) Dockerfile's that authors of
  binder-enabled repositories will write.

  Btw: Item 5 is new in the documentation; and seems optional at this
  stage.

IIRC it's a little less invasive and works for more use cases.  I can't remember though exactly why I didn't put `sage -sh` in the entrypoint.  I know I tried that and it had various problems.

So this runs a shell but then spawns the argument with `exec` so there is no additional process created if that's what you would like to avoid.

I think it was partly because of what you yourself said in terms of it changing too much of the default environment.

I think my main motivation was just ensure that the environment by default has Sage on the `$PATH`, as well as any other environment variables needed at runtime for software installed by Sage.  But I admit I can't remember why I also didn't just essentially make `sage -sh` the entrypoint.  I think it was partly because of what you yourself said in terms of it changing too much of the default environment.  I'm pretty sure I tried that at first and something didn't work right, but since I can't remember what it was I'd say go for it and give it a try anyways.

But I do agree with Nicolas that something like a `source sage-activate` would be good to have in Sage, to just modify the existing environment without going into a subshell (and a `deactivate` would be nice to have as well).  We could handle that in another issue though...

Sometimes my builds on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) hang. Apparently during the step of uploading build artifacts. The problem is that the log has already exceeded 3MB at that point so I can't see what was the actual build error. It would be nice of somehow dropping the boring parts from the log in GitLab…

I'd be hesitant to move forward on this if it can't build the docs from scratch anymore (though maybe it's not actually that big a problem...?)

That said, I don't want to hold this up any longer.  I just wonder exactly what the plan is for "bootstrapping" the whole system if it can't build a working Sage image from scratch.

Also, have you tried using serial doc build?  I seem to recall that ends up using less RAM, but takes longer of course...

Yes, I also don't really like to go ahead like that. It works on Circle and if you provide your own runners also on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab). But let me try a bit harder to make this work on GitLab's own shared runners again…

> That said, I don't want to hold this up any longer.  I just wonder exactly what the plan is for "bootstrapping" the whole system if it can't build a working Sage image from scratch.

We can bootstrap from CircleCI, or from my [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) runners that run on Google Compute Engine.

> Also, have you tried using serial doc build?  I seem to recall that ends up using less RAM, but takes longer of course...

I am building serial (MAKE=make -j1) already.

The serial runner might curiously be the culprit here. Somewhere in the sphinx build we seem to be leaking memory. Here I am plotting the memory usage in a serial build just before the call to `sphinxbuild()`:

```
[manifolds] process.memory_info()[0]): 280907776
[dynamics ] process.memory_info()[0]): 349028352
[polynomia] process.memory_info()[0]): 365514752
[repl     ] process.memory_info()[0]): 375050240
[tensor_fr] process.memory_info()[0]): 375050240
[combinat ] process.memory_info()[0]): 382959616
[plot3d   ] process.memory_info()[0]): 1632706560
```

And here is the same if I run this through the pool but with just one process:

```
[manifolds] process.memory_info()[0]): 230350848
[dynamics ] process.memory_info()[0]): 191688704
[polynomia] process.memory_info()[0]): 210935808
[repl     ] process.memory_info()[0]): 176205824
[tensor_fr] process.memory_info()[0]): 163934208
[combinat ] process.memory_info()[0]): 517341184
[plot3d   ] process.memory_info()[0]): 170418176
```

Btw, I am running `./sage -docbuild en/reference inventory` here but that's probably not that important.

 506             # The html refman must be build at the end to ensure correct
 507             # merging of indexes and inventories.
 508             # Sphinx is run here in the current process (not in a

 511             # the other documents.
 512             getattr(DocBuilder(self.name, lang), format)(*args, **kwds)
```

it chews up about a gigabyte alone, and never releases it.  I thought at first this might be the `InventoryCache` itself, but no that only appears to be about `~50MB` in size by my accounting.  So there's some other big objects that hang around when they really shouldn't anymore.

There's also quite a lot of Sage-related objects left in memory after the docbuild.

Not right now, but next week I think I will do some refactoring of the docbuild process a bit to ensure that `runsphinx()` is *always* run in a subprocess.  I think that will have a big impact at least in terms of keeping memory leaks under control.

I have some other thoughts I want to try out--that might go quite deep--in terms of keeping doctree sizes under better control too.  But that will probably be a longer effort.

Thanks for investigating improvements to our Sphinx build! I am adding Florent and Jeroen in CC.

At Sage Days 77, Florent and a sphinx developper had done some extensive analysis of the memory footprint of Sphinx. IIRC, there was a lot of useless information that was kept in the doctrees; and also some memory abuse that could not be explained, pointing to some plausible bug/leak in Sphinx itself. Also, IIRC, they had come to the conclusion that using Sphinx's built-in parallelisation was not out of reach. An aspect of it is that, instead of manually splitting our reference manual in smaller and smaller chunks we could tentatively revert back to a single document and let Sphinx play its magic.

But that's from the top of my head from two years ago; I'll let Florent comment and dig up notes from SD77.

> Is the serial build still necessary on cygwin?

Yes, in #21389 I changed things so that `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1` meant that *no* subprocesses were created during the docuild.  Originally that was motivated by need for Cygwin, but I don't believe that's necessary anymore (all the fork-related bugs *that I know of*) appear to be fixed.  I also now recognize that this is not good behavior.  As I wrote above, there's an enormous amount of global state that `runsphinx()` leaves around, and trying to clean it all up manually would be very difficult, so it should always be run in a subprocess.

Likewise, simply in the process of building the docs, there is also a lot of global state left in Sage (cached values and the like) which it turns out can eat up a lot of memory, especially after some of the larger docs (like manifolds).  This is likewise difficult to manually clean up.

Even a reversion of #21389 wouldn't fully fix the issue though since there are other parts of the docbuild that call `runsphinx()` without calling it in a subprocess, and those are responsible for quite a bit of unnecessary memory leakage currently (even in parallel doc builds).  So I intend to fix that.

We can follow up on the docbuild discussion elsewhere though, since other than its impact on CI the details of that are orthogonal to this ticket.

Thanks for the summary.  

Though the amount of minor tweaks this has continued to need seems to confirm my feeling that there should really be a way to get these changes into `develop` faster, somehow, or use a branch other than `develop` for CI purposes (but that is regularly reset to the latest `develop` as soon as any necessary changes are merged into `develop`...)  I don't know if you have any ideas about that.

Like, what if CircleCI, or [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) changes something, or Docker changes something that has to be worked around (something that has happened to me plenty of times already)?  We don't want to have all CI break until the next beta in `develop`...

I am not sure this is the right location to report on this. Maybe the README about our Docker image on dockerhub should contain some information on where to report issues?

Anyway, I am having trouble with using binder with the docker image for [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 8.2 as currently posted on dockerhub compared to that for 8.1.

Namely, when binder launches Jupyter, its working directory is `/home/sage/sage`, instead of `/home/sage` as before. This means in particular that all the notebooks and files that are copied over from the github repository with the usual `COPY . ${HOME}` are not accessible anymore.

Should WORK_DIR be reset to ${HOME} at the end of the Dockerfile?

I have a problem though: since binder already downloaded an image with tag 8.2, it won't redownload the new version. Is there a way to add an alias tag such as 8.2-1 ?

Replying to [@saraedum](#comment%3A226):
> nthiery: You are right, we should mention that bugs should be reported on trac as usual. I am not sure whether `COPY . ${HOME}` is the usual thing. I usually do `COPY --chown=sage:sage . .`.

IIRC, the binder doc suggests `COPY . ${HOME}`; in [sage-binder-env](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/), I am indeed adding `--chown=sage:sage`.

> I don't know, should we reset WORKDIR to HOME? Or should it be the place where Sage is installed. Let's reset it to HOME, so we don't break scripts that used to work with the 8.1 image. (This breaks compatibility with 8.2 images but anyway…)

I would tend to see the location of the sage install (and in general which ever software is installed) as an implementation detail; but this may be a bias from my use cases of the image!

Instead of having `build-from-clean` rely on runners tagged "do" (which I understand stands for Digital Ocean, though out of context I just read it as the word "do"), maybe let's have a tag like "big" or "fat" indicating "big enough to build sage from scratch", since in principle such a runner could be hosted anywhere (in fact I will probably set one up on our [OpenStack](../wiki/OpenStack) infrastructure ASAP).

I'm mostly caught up on it--it is a *lot* though.  As far as I'm concerned it's "positive review".  While I believe there are still areas we'll want to improve a lot of it comes down to computing resources (and other related issues like continuing to improve the resource usage of the doc build, for which I have ideas but haven't had a chance to try them yet).

I don't think we need general consent from or discussion on sage-devel. For me this ticket is only about automatically building docker images to publish them on our Docker Hub account more conveniently. It's not about replacing the patchbot, migrating to [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab), or anything like that.

At the same time this can of course be a first step towards more important changes, most promimently for me the binder ticket #24842. I'll put that one up for discussion on sage-devel once it's ready.

Speaking of which, I was going to ask if you saw my messages on Zulip.  But it appears to be down (and I'm afraid I might have broken it, somehow, by trying to log in): https://zulip.sagemath.org/

But I believe this could fall under [D3.8](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/67)

In this case what do you mean by "user namespace"?  You mean like, a personal fork?  I could try that.  Would I need to set up a self-provided runner?  I can do that too (and should practice that anyways).

Yes, I mean the typical use case for personal forks. More specifically, I meant the case where we are uploading to a docker hub account that is not the sagemath account.

No, you don't need private runners for this. The free shared runners should be sufficient.

Everything relevant works. However, strangely, when "building from latest", the resulting images have different sizes on CircleCI and GitLab CI:

sagemath: 611MB vs 635MB

sagemath-dev: 4GB vs 2GB

The dev images are not relevant in this case but still this is unfortunate. More importantly I would like to understand why these are different in size as the docker builds should be the same on both platforms.

This is due to a difference in docker daemon version. I don't know what's the difference between the two images but I know tell CircleCI to build using the latest stable version and both are 635MB in size.

> sagemath-dev: 4GB vs 2GB

This is a known bug in docker on aufs (that CircleCI is using.) There's isn't really anything we can do about it.

There's a problem with these Docker images, which is that it's impossible to install optional packages, which is a thing people are going to want to be able to do.  This is a problem, of course, because being able to install optional packages means at least having some minimal build toolchain available in the image.

I suppose they could `apt-get install` that after the fact, if desired (though this needs to be documented somehow).  But then there's the problem that `/home/sage/sage` is thoroughly stripped down, and does not have `configure`, `build/make/Makefile`, or anything else required for `sage -i` to work at a minimum.  This leads to the unhelpful error message 

```
/home/sage/sage/src/bin/sage: line 353: make: command not found
```

or even if you `sudo apt-get install make`:

```
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```

I'm not sure what we do about this.

No clue really. `sage -pip` works afaik, so that's good enough for some I think.

I am not sure who would want to install more packages. Since you need to add a bunch of build dependencies, we could consider pointing people to the dev images instead maybe? Actually many optional dependencies should already be detected by the features framework so they could be installed through `apt-get`?

Not for anything that's installed with `sage -i`

> I am not sure who would want to install more packages. Since you need to add a bunch of build dependencies, we could consider pointing people to the dev images instead maybe?

For now that's what I've done, and what I suppose we can continue to do for now.  Installing optional packages works for the dev images.

> Actually many optional dependencies should already be detected by the features framework so they could be installed through `apt-get`?

Yes, that's something we should work on separately.

I'm a little confused by the latest jobs on https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/pipelines

The last three jobs were all building the exact same commit: https://gitlab.com/saraedum/sage/commit/3af7c5006c0a9b3583f2bb2041c815c607b2f3f2

But one was triggered on an update to the "develop" branch, one was triggered on an update to a "build-from-latest" branch (what's that about?--apologies if I've already asked), and one was triggered by the new 8.4.beta1 tag.

Unfortunately I don't really know. My top showed a python2 process that did not do anything anymore but that apparently was the only thing that make was waiting for. I did not investigate further.

On [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) I could not see where it hung because we truncate the logs ourselves and we were already in that portion.

Yes, that explains some of the errors when pushing images in the end. But that's not what I have been refering to here.

Yes, that's fine. I pushed one to a branch (that's not called develop and not called master) to see if the build-from-latest still works.

The rules don't determine that there are several triggers that come from the same commit. CircleCI does that and it is imho very annoying to work around.

As a result, the develop and the 8.4.beta1 tag on docker hub do not come from the same run of "docker build". But since "docker build" should be reproducible anyway (in particular if we build-from-clean) I don't see this as a problem apart from the wasted resources.

Yes, build-from-clean times out on CircleCI. That's a known and documented issue.

No, it can't be configured and it's a common complaint about CircleCI.

I prefer not to squash the commits just because it's a lot of work. I am trying to write meaningful commit messages so if somebody really looks at the commit history some day it should be possible to make sense out of it.

But, yeah, let's get this back to positive review.

I spent some time reading through the log of the recent Circle-CI build that timed out, and that was at least edifying, to understand better step-by-step what the process is.  You've walked me through it a few times but it's still...complicated, to say the least.

I'm still not clear on what these timeouts you're referring to are, then, if it's not anything I could see on the recent builds...

Is it?  I see your note in the Dockerfile about it making the images too big, but not about it timing out.  If it's a known issue then shouldn't we just disable it for now?

I still feel like we ought to be able to work around that somehow.  I don't see why we would want to do two complete build-from-cleans of the same exact commit just so they wind up with different tags on Docker Hub.

I know you've thought about this more than I have so I'm probably missing something.  But my thinking is that until and unless Sage's "develop" branch is decoupled from its tags (something I think should happen but is not the case for now), we should edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.circleci/config.yml` to really only do build-from-clean on the `develop` branch (not even master).

It's a bit weird, I agree. But that's how people do that on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI. And usually builds don't take five hours, so it doesn't matter.

> I know you've thought about this more than I have so I'm probably missing something.

This would break if the branch and the tag are not pushed at the same time. Also, it's reasonable that you don't want to push all tags but just protected tags, e.g., I don't want to push the tags that I just use to check that building from tags actually works.

In short, I see your point but I'd rather leave it the way it is.

It's in the CircleCI configuration file:

```
# To make the build time not too excessive, we seed the build cache with
# sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop. When basic SPKGs change, this does not help much,
# still the full build does usually not exceed CircleCI's limits for open
# source projcets (five hours on 2 vCPUs as of early 2018.)
# You might want to try to build locally or with GitLab CI, see
# `.gitlab-ci.yml` for more options.

Back to positive review. Only a minor documentation change.

So, I would not disable the CircleCI builds as it does not do any harm:

* We won't configure CircleCI on our sagemath github repository (because it does not work reliably and we are building on [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) CI anyway.) so there is not going to be confusing messages there.
* If somebody has a clone of our repo and CircleCI enabled, then these builds only happen if they push to master or develop or if they push a tag (something people usually don't do in forks).
* Finally, it sometimes works. It really seems to be about how much load is on the actual machine that runs your docker container. I've seen builds complete after 4:59 or sometimes after 4:45. If we dropped a standard SPKG (python 2 eventually?) or Cython 2.9.0 or the next GCC is compiling faster for some reason, the builds are going to work reliably.

That said, #26085 should comunicate such things more clearly in the actual CI output.

I would need some logic that decides whether this tag is a "develop" or a "latest" tag. And maybe even have to decide whether this is really "later" than what's currently there. It's certainly doable but I don't see enough of an advantage really.

No, the master branch pushes to the "latest" tag, the develop branch pushes to the "develop" tag. Or, was that not your question maybe?

<div id="comment:342" align="right">comment:342</div>

I just don't see why we should build the exact same thing up to three times every time there's a release.  I looked at what happened when 8.3 was released and that added up to more than 15 hours worth of building (some of it was because push-dockerhub-dev took 2.5 hours??)--all the exact same thing--three times.

I don't know why we need to use the git branch/tag that happens to be being built to determine which docker-tag to push.

Every time 'develop' is updated a tag is created, and every time the tag is for a final release, 'master' also gets updated.  I don't like this process or the branch names but for now it is what it is.  Thus, it's only necessary to trigger a build-from-clean when a tag is created.  With docker you can re-tag the same image as many times as you want and push it to Docker Hub, and that can be done depending on what the version number in the tag is.

So what I'm proposing is to have one build, when a tag is created, with some `<version>` then,

1. Tag the image `sagemath:<version>`; push
2. If the version ends with `.betaN` or `.rcN`, re-tag the image `sagemath:develop`; push
3. Else re-tag the image `sagemath:latest`; push

One build resulting in 2 docker-tags for the same image, each time.

I think, theoretically, the way you do things currently makes sense, and might make sense to revert to at some point, but practically-speaking, right now, I don't see why we should do build-from-clean for anything but tags.

That's not correct, all tags should go to sagemath:develop.

Is it really an issue? It's a couple of hours of build time every week but it would be hardcoding knowledge about our release process which I don't like.

Also, there are some annoying races here (the following situation has happened to me when we worked with preemptible runners a lot.) With your proposed model the following could happen:

1. Create git-tag 9.0.
2. The CI fails for some reason, say a timeout pushing to docker hub.
3. Create git-tag 9.1.beta0
4. The CI pushes to sagemath:9.1.beta0 and sagemath:develop
5. Somebody realizes that the sagemath:9.0 build is missing and presses "retry" in the CI.
6. The CI pushes to sagemath:9.0, sagemath:latest, and sagemath:develop. Now sagemath:develop is not the latest beta.

This can't happen if you have develop branch → develop docker-tag; git-tag → docker-tag.
