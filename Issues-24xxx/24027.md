`FGP_Module` was written to model finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. Currently, only ZZ is tested and works. 
This ticket is to make it work for all PIDs

Issues:
- `.denominator()` over number fields behaves differently from over ZZ.

```
sage: from sage.modules.fg_pid.fgp_module import *
sage: L.<w> = NumberField(x^2 - x + 2)
sage:  OL = L.ring_of_integers()
sage: V = OL**3; W = V.span([[0,w,0], [1,0,1-w]], OL)
sage: Q = FGP_Module(V,W)
sage: TestSuite(Q).run()
sage: 
```
Runs now.
