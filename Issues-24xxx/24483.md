I can try. I just noticed minor things.

This one could use another line break:

```diff
        return Factorization([(R(gg).monic(), e) for gg, e in zip(*F)],
                             f.leading_coefficient())
+
cdef class ComplexNumber(sage.structure.element.FieldElement):
    """
    A floating point approximation to a complex number using any
```

Due to the new global import of `Integer`, you can also remove the following now unnecessary imports:

```diff
            sage: ComplexField().characteristic()
            0
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        return Integer(0)
...
            0.309016994374947 + 0.951056516295154*I
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        n = Integer(n)
        if n == 1:
```

Maybe there are more of those imports, but that's what I swiftly located.

As far as I can see it, some global variables are collected in the beginning of the file while others are placed right before the corresponding class/method. I think, some sort of unification with good commenting can be beneficial for readability. But maybe that's too pedantic right now and should be part of another ticket if necessary.

> Besides, this constant is already defined in `sage.arith.constants`, but with a slightly different value it seems. However, this value is imported in `sage.rings.complex_interval` and `sage.rings.real_mpfi`, i.e. everywhere else, but for the very same purpose. If it doesn't affect the code too much, one can import this value from there as well for the sake of unification.

True. Fixed in the last commit.

Is it worth to investigate why this (former) "spurious" output is gone now?
