I can try. I just noticed minor things.

This one could use another line break:

```diff
        return Factorization([(R(gg).monic(), e) for gg, e in zip(*F)],
                             f.leading_coefficient())
+
cdef class ComplexNumber(sage.structure.element.FieldElement):
    """
    A floating point approximation to a complex number using any
```

Due to the new global import of `Integer`, you can also remove the following now unnecessary imports:

```diff
            sage: ComplexField().characteristic()
            0
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        return Integer(0)
...
            0.309016994374947 + 0.951056516295154*I
        """
-        from .integer import Integer
        n = Integer(n)
        if n == 1:
```

Maybe there are more of those imports, but that's what I swiftly located.

As far as I can see it, some global variables are collected in the beginning of the file while others are placed right before the corresponding class/method. I think, some sort of unification with good commenting can be beneficial for readability. But maybe that's too pedantic right now and should be part of another ticket if necessary.

This comment in the ticket description perhaps needs clarification. I don't think we should be moving in the direction of encouraging imports from `*.all` modules.

Thank you. I moved around the `late_import`. The remaining `cache` global variable is used in the function just after. It makes sense to keep it there as it is not used anywhere else in the code.

Hi Vincent,

What would you think of keeping files `complex_field.py` and `complex_number.pyx` that `import *` from the new location for a while, in the interest of backward compatibility?
