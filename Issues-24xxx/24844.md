```
sage: p=next_prime(1000000)
sage: E=EllipticCurve(GF(p), 123, 456)
sage: pts = E(0).division_points(3)
sage: P=pts[1]; P
(389063 : 124244 : 1)
sage: 
sage: P._order
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field' object has no attribute '_order'
sage: P.order()
3
sage: P._order
3
sage: 
```

Here one might expect the point P's _order attribute to be set to 3 on construction since this can be deduced from what is known.
