```
sage: p=next_prime(1000000)
sage: E=EllipticCurve(GF(p), 123, 456)
sage: pts = E(0).division_points(3)
sage: P=pts[1]; P
(389063 : 124244 : 1)
sage: 
sage: P._order
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field' object has no attribute '_order'
sage: P.order()
3
sage: P._order
3
sage: 
```

Here one might expect the point P's _order attribute to be set to 3 on construction since this can be deduced from what is known.

More thoughts: we currently never set the order of a point computed via addition, subtraction or even negation.  The latter is uncontroversial!  The general case is probably too much since if you add two points of infinite order the result in principle could have any finite order, and even if the summands both have finite order then the sum could have any order dividing the lcm of those.

Hence I am now inclined to do less than was suggested in comment 2, but a little more than is in the first commit, namely if you divide E(0) by m then (since it safe to assume that m is easily factorisable when that succeeds) all points returned can have their actual order (dividing m) computed and set, using the generic order_from_multiple() function.
