```
sage: p=next_prime(1000000)
sage: E=EllipticCurve(GF(p), 123, 456)
sage: pts = E(0).division_points(3)
sage: P=pts[1]; P
(389063 : 124244 : 1)
sage: 
sage: P._order
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field' object has no attribute '_order'
sage: P.order()
3
sage: P._order
3
sage: 
```

Here one might expect the point P's _order attribute to be set to 3 on construction since this can be deduced from what is known.

Hence I am now inclined to do less than was suggested in comment 2, but a little more than is in the first commit, namely if you divide E(0) by m then (since it safe to assume that m is easily factorisable when that succeeds) all points returned can have their actual order (dividing m) computed and set, using the generic order_from_multiple() function.
