A student of mine got surprised this morning :-)

```
    sage: K = GF(3)
    sage: random_matrix(K, 3,3,algorithm="diagonalizable").parent()
    Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

Recommendations:
- Make it explicit in the documentation of `random_matrix` and `random_diagonalizable_matrix` that algorithm="diagonalizable" is only implemented for the rational field
- Add a check for the base ring in random_diagonalizable_matrix, and fail gracefully with a `NotImplementedError` if it's not `QQ`.

Alternatively: implement `random_diagonalizable_matrix` for any base ring/field. It sounds like the current algorithm would produce a reasonable answer; so this could boil down to just creating the matrix in the appropriate parent; and updating the documentation to say something like "if the parent is QQ, then the eigenvectors are guaranteed to ...".
