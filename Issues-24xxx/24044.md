I really dislike the avoiding of `self` in docstrings, but that is a controversial issue

The conventions do not really specify a recommended order, the patchbot was not complaining about that, and your judgment is always better than the patchbots. There is an actual problem, your indentation of the `.. SEEALSO::` in `is_tournament` is only 2 where it should be 4.

You made more changes than I said for positive review and that might require a little more scrutiny. I would have set it back to needs_review.
