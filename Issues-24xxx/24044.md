Thank you Travis. Actually, other methods use `the digraph` instead of `self`, so I changed to `the digraph`.

I have also moved the seealso blocks after the examples since the patchbot was complaining and that it seems to be the recommended order ([convention](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content)).

I set the ticket to positive review on your behalf.

I really dislike the avoiding of `self` in docstrings, but that is a controversial issue

The conventions do not really specify a recommended order, the patchbot was not complaining about that, and your judgment is always better than the patchbots. There is an actual problem, your indentation of the `.. SEEALSO::` in `is_tournament` is only 2 where it should be 4.

> I set the ticket to positive review on your behalf.


You made more changes than I said for positive review and that might require a little more scrutiny. I would have set it back to needs_review.
