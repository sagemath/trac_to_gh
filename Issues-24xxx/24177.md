An `ask.sagemath.com` [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39447/how-to-send-a-sagetex-file-to-someone-who-doesnt-use-sage/) led me to try the `makestatic.py`, and showed that this auxilliary script no longer works, the problem being possibly bound to the evolution of the [pyparsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) module used by this script.

Similar questions are probably to be asked about `extractsagecode.py`, `remote-sagetex.py` and `run-sagetex-if-necessary.py`.

Since SageTeX seems currently unmaintained, #22499 is probably a key to fixing this.
