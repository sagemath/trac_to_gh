currently #24596 requests use of GMP instead of MPIR, which is stopped by upstream's [issue 242](https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues/242) which makes building MPFR impossible.

A workaround in Sage would be very easy: e.g. apply the following patch to MPIR

```
--- a/gmp-h.in
+++ b/gmp-h.in
@@ -1242,6 +1242,8 @@ __GMP_DECLSPEC mpz_srcptr mpz_roinit_n (mpz_ptr, mp_srcptr, mp_size_t);
 /* if stdint.h is available -- n.b: we do NOT include stdint.h ourselves */
 #if defined(INTMAX_MAX)
 
+#include <stdint.h>   /* on Sun this is needed */
+
 #define __GMP_BITS_PER_UINTMAX  (8*sizeof(uintmax_t))
 
 #define mpz_get_ux __gmpz_get_ux
```

An alternative would be to patch MPFR.
