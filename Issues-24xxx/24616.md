Not sure whether this is a bug:

```
sage: GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()(filling=[0], shape=[1], labels=[[1],[],[1]]).out_labels()
[[1], [1, 1], [1]]
sage: GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()(filling=[], shape=[1], labels=[[1],[],[1]]).out_labels()
[[1], [1, 1], [1]]
sage: GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()(shape=[1], labels=[[1],[],[1]]).out_labels()
[[1], [], [1]]

<a id='comment:1'></a>
This is actually mentioned as a TODO:

```
    - when shape is given, check that it is compatible with filling
      or labels
```

the input

```
sage: GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()(shape=[1], labels=[[1],[],[1]])
```
is correctly interpreted as `labels` being the out-labels of the growth diagram (because no filling is given).  However, these labels do not make sense for this shape (and the RSK local rules).
