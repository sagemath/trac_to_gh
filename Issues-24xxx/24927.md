One of the remaining doctest failures come from the following.

There is a regression, before:

```
sage: sin(1/RBF(0))*0
0
```
after:

```
sage: sin(1/RBF(0))*0
nan
```

That's because of

```
sage: 1/RBF(0)
nan
```
which was infinite before.

> Should we expect `sin(nan)` to be `[+/- 1]` ?

No. And I think that's more or less the point of the change: sin(1/x) ∈ [-1,1] for all real x close to zero, but returning a finite ball could give the impression that sin(1/x) is analytic at zero (since, for complex balls, finite result ⇒ analytic).

In any case, the resulting enclosure is correct (if coarser than before), and if upstream decided to make that change, I think we should follow along.

FWIW, `nan`/`NaN` always leads to collapse of the expression tree.

`make ptestlong` gives me two failures:

```
File "src/sage/functions/other.py", line 1418, in sage.functions.other.Function_factorial._eval_
Failed example:
    factorial(RBF(2)**64)
Expected:
    [+/- 2.30e+347382171305201370464]
Got:
    [+/- 2.30e+347382171326740403407]

File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_complex_ball_dense.pyx", line 637, in sage.matrix.matrix_complex_ball_dense.Matrix_complex_ball_dense.charpoly
Failed example:
    mat.charpoly(algorithm="hessenberg")
Expected:
    x^5 + ([-1.8 +/- 0.0445])*x^4 + ([0.3 +/- 0.0833])*x^3
    + ([+/- 0.0164])*x^2 + ([+/- 6.01e-4])*x + [+/- 6.97e-6]

```

In the first one, using Stirling's formula confirms the regression:

```
sage: (log(sqrt(2*pi*2^64),10) + log(2^64/e,10)*2^64).n()
3.47382171305201e20
```

It is not a bug, even if the enclosure is a bit less tight as it used to... I think we should just change the expected output.
