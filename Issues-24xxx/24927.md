No. And I think that's more or less the point of the change: sin(1/x) ∈ [-1,1] for all real x close to zero, but returning a finite ball could give the impression that sin(1/x) is analytic at zero (since, for complex balls, finite result ⇒ analytic).

In any case, the resulting enclosure is correct (if coarser than before), and if upstream decided to make that change, I think we should follow along.

In the first one, using Stirling's formula confirms the regression:
