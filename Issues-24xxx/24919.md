Here's a look at the work I've been doing on top of (albeit not completely dependent on) #21524 in order to better support use of system packages for any of Sage's SPKGs.

This takes the workarounds that are already hard-coded in Sage's `configure.ac` for detecting certain packages--notably gcc/gfortran, yasm, git, and and curl--and converts those to a more generic mechanism.

In the new mechanism each SPKG may have a file in its SPKG directory named `spkg-configure.m4`.  The `./bootstrap` script gathers these all up and includes them into `configure`.

Each `spkg-configure.m4` should call a macro called `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` which is passed the package name, and some configure-time checks it should perform for that package.  See the documentation in `spkg-configure.m4` for more details on that macro.  Inside these checks, they should set either `sage_spkg_install_<pkgname>=yes|no` in order to track whether or not Sage should install that package, or if we can just the version from the system (or we don't require the package at all for the current platform).

We then move the hard-coded bits for yasm, gcc, etc. out of `configure.ac` and into their individual `spkg-configure.m4` files.  The end result is the same in terms of the checks that are performed.

As proof of concept we also add a configure-time check for the system's `patch`, demonstrating how this might be used to enable support for more system packages.

See #26286 for a follow-up.

It should be noted that, of course, each time a package's `spkg-configure.m4` is added or modified we must re-run `./bootstrap`, same as if we were just modifying `configure.ac` directly.

One other aspect of this that probably needs work before it's ready, is to add flags for explicitly selecting whether or not to use the system's version of some package.

I would definitely prefer to *not* install SPKGs by default we don't have to.  But we could also add a global flag like "always use SPKGs regardless of configure checks" or something.

Rebased, but I think some other cleanup of configure.ac is now needed as a prerequisite (e.g. #25011).

Dima, does that work without this ticket, or did this break it somehow?

The way this ticket does the feature test for curl is not substantively different from how it was done previously--it's just been moved to a different file.  But if it did work before then I'm sure there is a real bug.  Note, the correct `curl-config` also needs to be on the PATH, and needs to support `curl-config --checkfor 7.22`.

It didn't work before either, I think, but in fact `curl-config` is on the PATH,
and even tells you about the compiler flags:

```
$ curl-config --cflags
-I/usr/local/include
```
and the version seems good too:

```
$ curl-config --checkfor 7.22
$ curl-config --checkfor 999
requested version 999 is newer than existing 7.59.0
$ curl-config --version      
libcurl 7.59.0
```

Thanks.  If it wasn't working before this ticket either then I wouldn't be inclined to address it here, since this is just moving around the existing code.  I would open a separate issue for that.  Though it seems like it should work if you run it like `./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"`.

I'll see if I can set up a way to test that myself.  Also if there are problems with the C compiler itself many other configure-time checks won't succeed at first.

no, it doesn't work this way, at least not with clang on FreeBSD. I've opened    
#25214 
(I guess it differs from one compiler to the other whether /usr/local/include is searched by default or not)

By the way, on FreeBSD `patch` is BSD's patch, with a different versioning scheme, whereas GNU patch is gpatch. I wonder whether there is a way to deal with this easily.

Right now it *strictly* requires GNU patch.  In the past there was some reason for that in terms of some features that were needed, or possibly bugs, but I'd be surprised if that still really matters, especially since patching of spkgs was refactored...

I was working on #23353 and messed things up while manually merging your branch.
Namely, now 

```
git pull trac public/gfan/spkg_check
```
does not bring me the branch from #23353 back, and I wonder whether there is a painless way to force this... Do I need to locally rebase this branch somehow?

Maybe not autotools, since it's an optional package, and the main point of sage's autotools package was installing lots of different autoconf/automake versions for building patches to different package's configure scripts.

The rest though yeah--all of these kind of low level system libraries are the highest priority to add support for (add ncurses to that list--ncurses takes *forever* and we have to build it twice).

But first I want to get the general mechanism in place before adding support for a bunch more packages.

This is still ready go to.  Most of the dependencies are listed as dependencies just because they would conflict with this.  Or rather, because this moves around code from `configure.ac`, it also needs to incorporate other fixes I've made that also make changes to `configure.ac`.

But if any of those tickets remain controversial or whatever I can remove them from this ticket and deal with them later.

The substance of this ticket ticket is in providing support for `build/<pkg>/spkg-configure.m4` files, providing `configure`-time checks for individual packages.

Certainly there's nothing one can do about that; that's a problem that exists for any software.  The best you can do is that if you notice something breaks to try re-running `./configure`.  Depending on the exact nature of the checks for a given package, that still might not tell you anything, but the eventual result of debugging such a problem would be either a workaround for said incompatible version or changing the range of package versions that are considered compatible.

It is also still possible to force installation of the spkg.  Though one thing I think this might need, either in this ticket or in a followup, is a way to automatically add `--with-` flags for selecting the spkg over the system package or vice-versa.

My thinking was something like `--with-curl`, where the option can take an optional argument such as `--with-curl=<something>`, where `<something>` could technically be anything depending on the package, and it would be up to the package's `spkg-configure.ac` to determine what to do based on the argument.  Without the argument I think the default should be a special value like "spkg" meaning `--with-curl=spkg` or install cURL from the SPKG.

In other words, `--with-curl` would mean, "configure Sage to include Sage's curl".  

That's just one idea...there are other ways one could do this that might be better.  That's just my current line of thinking.

I also saw `build/pkgs/curl/spkg-configure.m4` not working due to `bc` not installed.
So `bc` should be added to build pre-reqs.

Huh, I'll have to give that a try.  I definitely didn't get anything like that when I last worked on this ticket, but maybe the bug was in a code path that `configure` didn't go down on my system (are you using Sage's GCC or no?)

Thank you for debugging and finding the problem.

I built Sage on that system, a Debian 8(?) xlc container on CromeOS laptop, before, just fine. I suppose that test for curl just failed, and as a result Sage's curl was built.

Somehow bc was not installed.


The test for curl existed in the original `configure.ac`, and I just moved the existing test to `build/pkgs/curl/spkg-configure.m4` pretty much unmodified. It's not clear to me where it's looking for `bc` either.  I thought `bc` was one of those things that's pretty much always there, like grep (albeit more obscure).
>

Yes, I saw "bc not found" in config.log, in a curl-related chunk.

I'm away from the box till evening but you can try uninstalling bc yourself and observing the result.

without `bc`, one has

```
$ curl-config --checkfor 7.22
/usr/bin/curl-config: 1: /usr/bin/curl-config: bc: not found
/usr/bin/curl-config: 1: /usr/bin/curl-config: bc: not found
/usr/bin/curl-config: 112: test: Illegal number: 
requested version 7.22 is newer than existing 7.52.1
```
As `spkg-configure.m4` invokes `curl-config --checkfor`, you get this error
if no `bc` is installed. So this is a bug in `curl`, if you like. `bc` is used to
compute the "raw" version.
You see there

```
        cpatch=`echo $checkfor | cut -d. -f3 | cut -d- -f1`
        checknum=`echo "$cmajor*256*256 + $cminor*256 + ${cpatch:-0}" | bc`
        numuppercase=`echo 073401 | tr 'a-f' 'A-F'`
        nownum=`echo "obase=10; ibase=16; $numuppercase" | bc`
```

Let us add the corresponding check in `configure.ac` and bail out if it's not there:

```
AC_CHECK_PROG(found_bc, bc, yes, no)
if test x$found_bc != xyes
then
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([Sorry, the 'bc' command must be in the path to build AC_PACKAGE_NAME])
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([On some systems it can be found in /usr/ccs/bin])
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([See also https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/])
    AC_MSG_ERROR([Exiting, as the calculator 'bc' can not be found.])
fi
```

How about doing something like this for `cut`, as well, just as an extra sanity check?

Oh, well in the case of patch I can tell you exactly why it's needed: the regular expression I use in the `sed` call uses square brackets, such as `[0-9]`.  These are the default quote characters used in autoconf, so you need to `changequote` here (or use hideous m4 escape sequences).

Did you find it didn't work *without* it, or is it just cargo cult?

It escaped me that [] might need a special treatment, I thought it's something to do with potentially rougue numering using `,` i.p.of `.`

Yes, in m4 the default left and right quotes are <code>\`'</code>, but autoconf immediately sets the quotes to `[]`, because autoconf is basically a big pile of m4 macros for generating *shell* code where <code>\`</code> and `'` are meaningful and common.

Of course, so are `[]` in the context of tests, but there the `[` is just a well-known synonym for `test`, which is why in autoconf you have to write `if test` instead of `if [` in most places.

However, there are other rare cases where you might want to use `[]` as literals, such as in regular expressions, so there it's best to temporarily `changequotes()`.  But the only reason you ever need to do that is if you really want to output some square brackets somewhere in your macro.

There is something wrong with `yasm/spkg-configure.m4`. Namely, `./configure` does not report whether the result is yes or no. In `config.log` I see

```
...
configure:8328: === checking whether to install the xz SPKG ===
configure:8343: checking for xz >= 5.2.2
configure:8422: result: /usr/bin/xz
configure:8438: === checking whether to install the yasm SPKG ===
configure:8553: checking SPKGs to install
configure:8555: result: 
configure:8644: result:     4ti2-1.6.7
...
```
so it looks like something is not right with it.

Ok, now it shows

the message about the Fortran flag really belongs with the gfortran checks, but for some reason (and I noticed this long before) that check gets inserted into the configure script early, possibly something to do with diversions but I'm not sure.  I'm not going to worry about it right now.

and all packages are going to be installed. As I said before, with a vanilla Sage, curl, git, gcc, and gfortran are not installed by Sage on this computer, because `./configure` correctly detects them.

The `configure` script looks strange: after the line `# Configure all spkgs with configure-time checks`, there are about 30 blank lines, followed by

Thank you.  This looks similar to the same silly issue that came up in #26013 with the BSD `find` not stripping trailing slashes from its argument.

Also if you are merging my private branch then prepare for a world of pain as I'm going to rewrite it before publishing...

No, this was not done, certainly.
Now we have the beta branch to rebase this against, could you please put in into the next beta?

cutting/pasting from `git blame build/make/deps`:

in the current develop branch (notice `xz`):

```
15c7b88bd76 build/make/deps     (Erik M. Bray    2018-07-17 15:59:31 +0000  81) TOOLCHAIN_DEPS = zlib xz $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc
```
in this ticket's branch (notice there is no `xz`):

```
9c1b4f6c243 build/make/deps     (Erik M. Bray    2018-07-17 15:59:31 +0000  80) TOOLCHAIN_DEPS = zlib $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc
```

and we have two very similar commits, but not quite:

This looks very fishy, as the dates/times are the same, only hashes are different.
And merging this ticket branch into develop does not quite work, as e.g. `build/make/deps` does not get updated!

Erik, Volker, any ideas what's up there?

so that just started in 8.5.beta2 since #25188 was merged in that build.  It was never intended that xz should be added to `TOOLCHAIN_DEPS` as part of that ticket. I just screwed up  :(

I still have some doubts about whether the gcc-related checks are working as intended.  I need to re-review my original fixes for those and ensure that this isn't causing a regression (I think it might be).

Previously I had incorporated all those fixes into this ticket but everything's been through so many revisions/rebases it's not clear that it's working as I expect.
