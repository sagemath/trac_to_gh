Here's a look at the work I've been doing on top of (albeit not completely dependent on) #21524 in order to better support use of system packages for any of Sage's SPKGs.

This takes the workarounds that are already hard-coded in Sage's `configure.ac` for detecting certain packages--notably gcc/gfortran, yasm, git, and and curl--and converts those to a more generic mechanism.

In the new mechanism each SPKG may have a file in its SPKG directory named `spkg-configure.m4`.  The `./bootstrap` script gathers these all up and includes them into `configure`.

Each `spkg-configure.m4` should call a macro called `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` which is passed the package name, and some configure-time checks it should perform for that package.  See the documentation in `spkg-configure.m4` for more details on that macro.  Inside these checks, they should set either `sage_spkg_install_<pkgname>=yes|no` in order to track whether or not Sage should install that package, or if we can just the version from the system (or we don't require the package at all for the current platform).

We then move the hard-coded bits for yasm, gcc, etc. out of `configure.ac` and into their individual `spkg-configure.m4` files.  The end result is the same in terms of the checks that are performed.

As proof of concept we also add a configure-time check for the system's `patch`, demonstrating how this might be used to enable support for more system packages.

See #26286 for a follow-up.

One other aspect of this that probably needs work before it's ready, is to add flags for explicitly selecting whether or not to use the system's version of some package.

I would definitely prefer to *not* install SPKGs by default we don't have to.  But we could also add a global flag like "always use SPKGs regardless of configure checks" or something.

Dima, does that work without this ticket, or did this break it somehow?

The way this ticket does the feature test for curl is not substantively different from how it was done previously--it's just been moved to a different file.  But if it did work before then I'm sure there is a real bug.  Note, the correct `curl-config` also needs to be on the PATH, and needs to support `curl-config --checkfor 7.22`.

It didn't work before either, I think, but in fact `curl-config` is on the PATH,
and even tells you about the compiler flags:

```
$ curl-config --cflags
-I/usr/local/include
```
and the version seems good too:

```
$ curl-config --checkfor 7.22
$ curl-config --checkfor 999
requested version 999 is newer than existing 7.59.0
$ curl-config --version      
libcurl 7.59.0
```

Thanks.  If it wasn't working before this ticket either then I wouldn't be inclined to address it here, since this is just moving around the existing code.  I would open a separate issue for that.  Though it seems like it should work if you run it like `./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"`.

I'll see if I can set up a way to test that myself.  Also if there are problems with the C compiler itself many other configure-time checks won't succeed at first.

no, it doesn't work this way, at least not with clang on FreeBSD. I've opened

I was working on #23353 and messed things up while manually merging your branch.
Namely, now 

```
git pull trac public/gfan/spkg_check
```
does not bring me the branch from #23353 back, and I wonder whether there is a painless way to force this... Do I need to locally rebase this branch somehow?

Maybe not autotools, since it's an optional package, and the main point of sage's autotools package was installing lots of different autoconf/automake versions for building patches to different package's configure scripts.

The rest though yeah--all of these kind of low level system libraries are the highest priority to add support for (add ncurses to that list--ncurses takes *forever* and we have to build it twice).

But first I want to get the general mechanism in place before adding support for a bunch more packages.

This is still ready go to.  Most of the dependencies are listed as dependencies just because they would conflict with this.  Or rather, because this moves around code from `configure.ac`, it also needs to incorporate other fixes I've made that also make changes to `configure.ac`.

But if any of those tickets remain controversial or whatever I can remove them from this ticket and deal with them later.

The substance of this ticket ticket is in providing support for `build/<pkg>/spkg-configure.m4` files, providing `configure`-time checks for individual packages.

Certainly there's nothing one can do about that; that's a problem that exists for any software.  The best you can do is that if you notice something breaks to try re-running `./configure`.  Depending on the exact nature of the checks for a given package, that still might not tell you anything, but the eventual result of debugging such a problem would be either a workaround for said incompatible version or changing the range of package versions that are considered compatible.

It is also still possible to force installation of the spkg.  Though one thing I think this might need, either in this ticket or in a followup, is a way to automatically add `--with-` flags for selecting the spkg over the system package or vice-versa.

My thinking was something like `--with-curl`, where the option can take an optional argument such as `--with-curl=<something>`, where `<something>` could technically be anything depending on the package, and it would be up to the package's `spkg-configure.ac` to determine what to do based on the argument.  Without the argument I think the default should be a special value like "spkg" meaning `--with-curl=spkg` or install cURL from the SPKG.

In other words, `--with-curl` would mean, "configure Sage to include Sage's curl".  

That's just one idea...there are other ways one could do this that might be better.  That's just my current line of thinking.

I also saw `build/pkgs/curl/spkg-configure.m4` not working due to `bc` not installed.

I built Sage on that system, a Debian 8(?) xlc container on CromeOS laptop, before, just fine. I suppose that test for curl just failed, and as a result Sage's curl was built.

Somehow bc was not installed.


The test for curl existed in the original `configure.ac`, and I just moved the existing test to `build/pkgs/curl/spkg-configure.m4` pretty much unmodified. It's not clear to me where it's looking for `bc` either.  I thought `bc` was one of those things that's pretty much always there, like grep (albeit more obscure).

Yes, I saw "bc not found" in config.log, in a curl-related chunk.

I'm away from the box till evening but you can try uninstalling bc yourself and observing the result.

I'll have to figure out what exactly was trying to use `bc` and not finding it.  That could be a bug in on of the standard autoconf macros, because in general they won't try to use a program that autoconf hasn't found first.

In any case, as long as the resulting behavior is to report curl as not found and move on, I'm mostly OK with that.  The goal here is not necessarily to make all packages detectable 100% of the time* (though if there are cases where they should have been detected and weren't we certainly want to look into that).

without `bc`, one has

```
$ curl-config --checkfor 7.22
/usr/bin/curl-config: 1: /usr/bin/curl-config: bc: not found
/usr/bin/curl-config: 1: /usr/bin/curl-config: bc: not found
/usr/bin/curl-config: 112: test: Illegal number: 
requested version 7.22 is newer than existing 7.52.1
```
As `spkg-configure.m4` invokes `curl-config --checkfor`, you get this error
if no `bc` is installed. So this is a bug in `curl`, if you like. `bc` is used to
compute the "raw" version.
You see there

```
        cpatch=`echo $checkfor | cut -d. -f3 | cut -d- -f1`
        checknum=`echo "$cmajor*256*256 + $cminor*256 + ${cpatch:-0}" | bc`
        numuppercase=`echo 073401 | tr 'a-f' 'A-F'`
        nownum=`echo "obase=10; ibase=16; $numuppercase" | bc`
```

Let us add the corresponding check in `configure.ac` and bail out if it's not there:

```
AC_CHECK_PROG(found_bc, bc, yes, no)
if test x$found_bc != xyes
then
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([Sorry, the 'bc' command must be in the path to build AC_PACKAGE_NAME])
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([On some systems it can be found in /usr/ccs/bin])
    AC_MSG_NOTICE([See also https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/])
    AC_MSG_ERROR([Exiting, as the calculator 'bc' can not be found.])
fi
```

How about doing something like this for `cut`, as well, just as an extra sanity check?

Yes, in m4 the default left and right quotes are <code>\`'</code>, but autoconf immediately sets the quotes to `[]`, because autoconf is basically a big pile of m4 macros for generating *shell* code where <code>\`</code> and `'` are meaningful and common.

Of course, so are `[]` in the context of tests, but there the `[` is just a well-known synonym for `test`, which is why in autoconf you have to write `if test` instead of `if [` in most places.

However, there are other rare cases where you might want to use `[]` as literals, such as in regular expressions, so there it's best to temporarily `changequotes()`.  But the only reason you ever need to do that is if you really want to output some square brackets somewhere in your macro.

That stuff is supposed to already be in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` so any rebase (which would include #25011 now) would indeed have to remove that block from `configure.ac` (and ensure that the relevant code in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` also matches).

Dima, John, for both of these issues, do you have the same issue without this patch?  Because otherwise it's not relevant to the mechanism being implemented here, as for both yasm and curl this ticket is already using the exact same configuration already in place and has just refactored things a little.

If it works *without* this ticket then that is a problem with the refactoring.  If you have the same problem with or without this ticket then that means it's working more or less as intended.

There is something wrong with `yasm/spkg-configure.m4`. Namely, `./configure` does not report whether the result is yes or no. In `config.log` I see

```
...
configure:8328: === checking whether to install the xz SPKG ===
configure:8343: checking for xz >= 5.2.2
configure:8422: result: /usr/bin/xz
configure:8438: === checking whether to install the yasm SPKG ===
configure:8553: checking SPKGs to install
configure:8555: result: 
configure:8644: result:     4ti2-1.6.7
...
```
so it looks like something is not right with it.

I noticed that, but I don't think it's a problem.  The check is skipped for yasm entirely in most cases because yasm isn't even installed on all platforms.

That new notice I added just gets printed before each package that's checked for, but the final results are summarized later.  Maybe there should be an additional message clarifying what's going on following each of those "checking whether to install..." messages?

cutting/pasting from `git blame build/make/deps`:

in the current develop branch (notice `xz`):

```
15c7b88bd76 build/make/deps     (Erik M. Bray    2018-07-17 15:59:31 +0000  81) TOOLCHAIN_DEPS = zlib xz $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc
```
in this ticket's branch (notice there is no `xz`):

```
9c1b4f6c243 build/make/deps     (Erik M. Bray    2018-07-17 15:59:31 +0000  80) TOOLCHAIN_DEPS = zlib $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc
```

and we have two very similar commits, but not quite:

```

This looks very fishy, as the dates/times are the same, only hashes are different.
And merging this ticket branch into develop does not quite work, as e.g. `build/make/deps` does not get updated!

Erik, Volker, any ideas what's up there?

I still have some doubts about whether the gcc-related checks are working as intended.  I need to re-review my original fixes for those and ensure that this isn't causing a regression (I think it might be).

Previously I had incorporated all those fixes into this ticket but everything's been through so many revisions/rebases it's not clear that it's working as I expect.
