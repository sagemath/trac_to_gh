When I worked on this a couple of years ago I thought long and hard whether I should do a public  interface to this code, and thought it's too much trouble, for noone cares. Wrong :-)

 
Anyhow, the generalisation of Paley digraphs I am talking about is due to A.Duval, [J.Comb.Th. 47(1988) pp. 71-100](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009731658890043X)
