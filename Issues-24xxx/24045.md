In all respect, this is code bloat, if you ask me... Indeed, Paley digraphs (and, more generally, tournaments with the same spectral properties as of Payley ones) are essential for constructing Hadamard matrices (and Pasechnik graphs ;-)), and in fact the following lines (only few lines down
from your patch) in 
`src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py`
construct the (Seidel, i.e -1,1) adjacency matrix of such a digraph---and more, they do it for more values of 4n-1 than these which are prime powers, e.g. for n=4.

```
    from sage.combinat.matrices.hadamard_matrix import skew_hadamard_matrix
    from sage.matrix.constructor import identity_matrix, matrix
    H = skew_hadamard_matrix(4*n)
    M = H[1:].T[1:] - identity_matrix(4*n-1)
```

When I worked on this a couple of years ago I thought long and hard whether I should do a public  interface to this code, and thought it's too much trouble, for noone cares. Wrong :-)

 
Anyhow, the generalisation of Paley digraphs I am talking about is due to A.Duval, [J.Comb.Th. 47(1988) pp. 71-100](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009731658890043X) 
and is nowadays called strongly regular digraph. We can do a ticket constructing examples---using code in comment 14 above, and Paley would be a subcase (in fact, this code will give you Paley if 4n-1 happens to be a prime power).
