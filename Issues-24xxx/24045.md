from your patch) in 
`src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py`
construct the (Seidel, i.e -1,1) adjacency matrix of such a digraph---and more, they do it for more values of 4n-1 than these which are prime powers, e.g. for n=4.

When I worked on this a couple of years ago I thought long and hard whether I should do a public  interface to this code, and thought it's too much trouble, for noone cares. Wrong :-)

 
Anyhow, the generalisation of Paley digraphs I am talking about is due to A.Duval, [J.Comb.Th. 47(1988) pp. 71-100](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009731658890043X)
