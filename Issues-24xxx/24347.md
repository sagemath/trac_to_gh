<a id='comment:4'></a>Coxeter matrices have a custom rank method to make them agree with the notation of rank as a Coxeter type. So that rank is not a problem.

Could you also add a test for A<sub>1</sub> x A<sub>1</sub> x A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> x A<sub>2</sub>? Once done, positive review on my behalf.

I seem to have come across an unrelated interesting bug:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2,1])
sage: W._matrix._matrix.rref()  # This is wrong
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
sage: W._matrix._matrix.echelon_form()
Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object' in <type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'> ignored
^CERROR:root:Internal Python error in the inspect module.
Below is the traceback from this internal error.
  File "/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/ultratb.py", line 1132, in get_records

    records = fix_frame_records_filenames(inspect.getinnerframes(etb, context))

    filename = getsourcefile(frame) or getfile(frame)

    if hasattr(getmodule(object, filename), '__loader__'):
  File "/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/inspect.py", line 490, in getmodule
    if ismodule(module) and hasattr(module, '__file__'):

Might be related to how we are constructing the Coxeter matrix and some `int` vs `Integer` (but all entries by the `.list()` were `Integer`).
