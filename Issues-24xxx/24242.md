A few Sage modules import the Python module `string`. Since this name is so generic, it might conflict with submodules inside Sage (this happened in #24222). So it's better to use `from `__future__` import absolute_import`.

I thought at some point we had agreed to just put `from `__future__` import absolute_import` in every module.  It is *much better* anyways than the old import semantics.
