There are several issues:

1. `error: call of overloaded 'pow(int&, int&)' is ambiguous`: Solution: use `std::pow()` instead of `pow()`.
**Upstream**: https://github.com/Singular/Sources/pull/848

2.

```
walk.cc: In function 'intvec* MWalkRandomNextWeight(ideal, intvec*, intvec*, int, int)':
walk.cc:4564:49: error: call of overloaded 'sqrt(int&)' is ambiguous
         weight_norm = 1 + floor(sqrt(weight_norm));
```
**Upstream**: https://github.com/Singular/Sources/pull/852

3.

```
walk.cc:4570:103: error: call of overloaded 'floor(int)' is ambiguous
           (*next_weight2)[i] = 1 + (*curr_weight)[i] + floor(weight_rad*(*next_weight2)[i]/weight_norm);
```
and

```
walk.cc:4574:99: error: call of overloaded 'floor(int)' is ambiguous
           (*next_weight2)[i] = (*curr_weight)[i] + floor(weight_rad*(*next_weight2)[i]/weight_norm);
```
**Upstream**: https://github.com/Singular/Sources/pull/850

4. Specific `-Wl` linker syntax in `libpolys/polys/Makefile.am` which nukes linking (as Solaris linker does not accept `dynamic_lookup` parameter). (By right, it's autotools that should generate such platform-specific arguments, it's asking for trouble to give them explicitly). 
**Upstream**: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/816

5. Undefined `gethostbyname` and some other symbols from `-lsocket` and `-lnsl`. This is something that should be set by an autoconf macro, e.g. [ax_lib_socket_nsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_lib_socket_nsl.html)

After these changes, I ran Singular's `./autogen.sh`, producing a 90+K diff to their tarball. Applying this patch makes Singular build on Solaris 11.
(Probably the diff size can be reduced by using a more closely matching, version-wise, autotools).

Packaging a 90+K diff looks a bit silly - what should one do to package it (until the upstream picks it up, which might take I don't know how long).

Do we distribute a patched tarball now?

Do you need to do something Cygwin specific to get gethostbyname working in Singular?
(IIRC you need `-lsocket` on Cygwin).

How do you report bugs for Singular? Do you have a trac account with them, or you submit anonymously, like I did?
