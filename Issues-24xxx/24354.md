Now raises an error (thanks to #28517, I think). That's okay, though it would be even better to have a mechanism that makes this evaluation boil down to something like `RBF(CBF(1/3).psi(1))`.

The generic symbolic evaluation is making at least two mistakes here. The code is at lines 1562-1568 of expression.pyx

```
try:
    res = self.operator()(*[R(a) for a in args])
except (TypeError, ValueError):
    pass
else:
    if res.parent() is R:
        return res
```

With the input provided in the ticket description, it produces

```
sage: from sage.functions.gamma import psi2
sage: psi2(RBF(1), RBF(1/3))
psi(1.000000000000000, [0.3333333333333333 +/- 7.04e-17])
```
This is bad since the proper way to make the call should have been `psi(1, RBF(1/3))`.

Secondly, `psi(1, RBF(1/3))` is broken as it should produce a ball

```
sage: from sage.functions.gamma import psi2
sage: psi2(1, RBF(1/3))
psi(1, [0.3333333333333333 +/- 7.04e-17])
```

Is there a ticket to improve the `RBF(expression)`?

Close it, IMO. Improving `RBF(expr)` will take several tickets, and this one provides no clear roadmap.

...Because it replaces the intervals with points:

```
sage: RIF(psi(RIF(0.99,1.01),1/3))
10.095597125427095?

(So the bug is that it works.)
