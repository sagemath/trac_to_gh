Because I need to call it twice, also from `__init__`. If you're worried about efficiency, that shouldn't be a problem because it's inlined.

This is useful for dealing with some of the kinds of issues discussed in #24757.   It's not a silver-bullet since it requires either a sized object (with `__len__`) or an otherwise specified length, but that's still useful for a lot of cases.
