Erik, this is a bit frustrating that you alone have a branch where you can launch doctests in python3.

How far are we from having vanilla sage build and start with python3 ? I think after #24223, we will be very close but not quite there. In my opinion, we should aim to reach that state as soon as possible. And the next step would be to be able to use "sage -t" in vanilla sage+py3.

I don't think that's true. I'm sure I've pointed you to #24343 which has the fixes necessary for the doctest runner to work, at least I think.  You can always merge that in to your local branch and try it--I'd assumed you already have been.
