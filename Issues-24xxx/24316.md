I'm using sage 8.0. Here is what I get:

```
sage: b,c,d=var('b c d')

sage: integrate(sqrt(b*cos(x)^2 + c*sin(x)^2 + 2*d*sin(x)*cos(x)), x, 0, 2*pi,algorithm='maxima')

-1/2*pi*b
```

That answer cannot possibly be correct, as the integrand is symmetric in b and c (you can substitute x with pi/2-x ...). Checking the answer numerically shows that it is indeed wrong.
