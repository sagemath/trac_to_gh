Replace calls to `is_Set` with the code it has, which is just `isinstance(x, Set_generic)`.

`is_Set` is not intended to answer the question "is this object a set". There is no need to let `RealSet` inherits from `Set_generic`. As I already mentioned in #15344, what does work is

```
sage: RealSet(1,2) in Sets()
True
```

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
At least from what I understand, these calls to `is_Set` are correct, and I agree that

```
isinstance(x, (SetPartition, set, frozenset, Set_generic))
```
would be easier to understand for me.

More precisely: I believe that this code is to make

```
sage: Set([Set([1,2])]) in SetPartitions
True
```
work.

It has started long ago
- `sage.schemes.projective.projective_space.is_ProjectiveSpace`
- `sage.schemes.product_projective.space.is_ProductProjectiveSpaces`
- `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.is_PolynomialRing`
- `sage.rings.ring.is_Ring`
- etc

The only reasonable solution is to agree with all other developers (on sage-devel) that we want to remove them all from Sage (I am +1 for it). Then we could start with a "task ticket" listing all the `is_X` and start concretely by removing `is_Set`.
