It has started long ago
- `sage.schemes.projective.projective_space.is_ProjectiveSpace`
- `sage.schemes.product_projective.space.is_ProductProjectiveSpaces`
- `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.is_PolynomialRing`
- `sage.rings.ring.is_Ring`
- etc

The only reasonable solution is to agree with all other developers (on sage-devel) that we want to remove them all from Sage (I am +1 for it). Then we could start with a "task ticket" listing all the `is_X` and start concretely by removing `is_Set`.

The question was asked at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/wEzb0awmyN0 and I think there was agreement to do it case by case.
