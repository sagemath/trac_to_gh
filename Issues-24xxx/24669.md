It was disabled in #22021 to work around some deadlocks that were occurring, and still further problems were reported in #23933.

But these issues appear to be fixed as of OpenBLAS 0.2.20 which Sage is now on.  It would be good if more people can test this though (especially on OSX).

This also includes a patch for Cygwin without which this change renders openblas broken on Cygwin.  This will resolve issues like #22822 (of course, it doesn't actually fix the Cygwin openblas package if it gets used by mistake, but that will be fixed too if upstream accepts my patch).
