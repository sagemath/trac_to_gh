I'm thinking we should just get rid of "script" type.  It only applies to three packages and there's no good reason for it.  It's a misuse of "package type" anyways, which we'd like to get away from being a reflection of how a package is installed and more a reflection of under what circumstances the package should be installed (i.e. standard vs. optional).

I would propose that we convert these packages' types to "optional", treat "script" as an alias for "optional", and write a deprecation warning in the off chance that someone tries to use "script" type again.
