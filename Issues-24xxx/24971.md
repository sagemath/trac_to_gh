```
sage: preparse("0 = x")
'__tmp__=var("0"); Integer = symbolic_expression(x).function(0)'
```
This is because `0 = x` becomes `Integer(0) = x` which is interpreted as defining a function `Integer` in the variable `0`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>
This must happen because of double preparsing:

```
0 = p
```
becomes

```
Integer(0) = p
```
which is interpreted as a function definition of the function `Integer` in the variable `0`.
