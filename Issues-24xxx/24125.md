Looks good so far.

Do i need to set the default case for `center` also in the growth_group? At the moment the default case is declared in the asymptotic ring constructor. 
The import of `Infinity` is now placed in the class call. I think i should do the same with the asymptotic_ring. I have some questions regrading the last item, can we talk about them tomorrow at the office?
