Looks good so far.

```
names=None, category=None, default_prec=None, center = None):
```
No spaces before and after these `=`. See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.

Do i need to set the default case for `center` also in the growth_group? At the moment the default case is declared in the asymptotic ring constructor. 
The import of `Infinity` is now placed in the class call. I think i should do the same with the asymptotic_ring. I have some questions regrading the last item, can we talk about them tomorrow at the office?
