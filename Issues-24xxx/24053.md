In the file `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions.py`, the function `asymptotics_multiple()` is insufficiently doctested. It seems that only the case "`n == d`" is tested. All tests in `sage/rings/asymptotic` still pass when applying

I discovered this because the function `binomial` is imported from a deprecated module, but no deprecation warning triggers.
