```
With these changes, at the very least, I was able to get 1+1 working:

```
sage: gap('1+1;')
2
sage: maxima('1+1;')
2
```

However, see #24268 for further discussion.

Keywords: **gap maxima**

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>\nI made #24268 for discussing overall strategy, but as you can see from this ticket and others the strategy I've gone with for now is leaving pexpect to deal in bytes, and sprinkle conversions all around.  I'm not particularly happy with this strategy and fear that it might backfire.\n\nAdding specific methods might not be a bad idea, and I've considered it. The `Expect` class (seemingly inexplicably) has a `_before()` method which just returns the `.before` attribute.  It's used in just a handful of places, and most other interfaces use `self._expect.before` directly.\n\nIt might make more sense to get rid of `Expect._before` but add an `Expect.before` property that wraps `self._expect.before` with the relevant string conversion (and likewise for `after`).  That might be a start in a better direction, anyways...",

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
I made #24268 for discussing overall strategy, but as you can see from this ticket and others the strategy I've gone with for now is leaving pexpect to deal in bytes, and sprinkle conversions all around.  I'm not particularly happy with this strategy and fear that it might backfire.

Adding specific methods might not be a bad idea, and I've considered it. The `Expect` class (seemingly inexplicably) has a `_before()` method which just returns the `.before` attribute.  It's used in just a handful of places, and most other interfaces use `self._expect.before` directly.

It might make more sense to get rid of `Expect._before` but add an `Expect.before` property that wraps `self._expect.before` with the relevant string conversion (and likewise for `after`).  That might be a start in a better direction, anyways...
