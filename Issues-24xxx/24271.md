```
On Python 2 exception messages are printed, along with the exception class name, like

```
SignError: cannot multiply infinity by zero
```

whereas on Python 3 they're printed with the exception class's fully qualified name (for non-builtin exceptions):

```
sage.rings.infinity.SignError: cannot multiply infinity by zero
```

Therefore any doctest that expects a traceback fails, due to this slight formatting difference.  One can go through all such tests and insert ellipses.  But it's simpler if we just normalize for this trivial formatting difference, similarly to #24258.

Additionally, there were a few common exceptions (particularly `IOError` which [as of Python 3.3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError) are just aliases for `OSError`, so we handle that case as well.

In this case the fixup isn't done directly in the `OutputChecker` since, in order to make this normalization as restrictive as possible, we need access to the exception info which is not normally passed to `OutputChecker`.  So this is handled directly in `SageDocTestRunner`'s result handling.

This made a lot of previously "failing" tests pass for me.  But it should be made clear that this normalization does not in any way take away from the validity of the tests.

1. Why this check?

```
if exc_info[0].__module__
```
Are there any cases where `__module__` would *not* be a `True` value?

2. You really want to use `__qualname__` instead of `__name__` on Python 3, since that is what the `traceback` module uses.

For reference, this is the relevant code from the `traceback` module:

```
        stype = self.exc_type.__qualname__
        smod = self.exc_type.__module__
        if smod not in ("__main__", "builtins"):
            stype = smod + '.' + stype
```

While I can't name an exact case off the top of my head, I've seen pathological cases (especially in the context of dynamically created classes) where `__module__` can be `None`.  For functions and methods it can definitely be `None`.  Whether or not that's "valid" for classes is less clear.  Anyways it's unlikely to occur, but safer to check for anyways.  You're right about `__qualname__`.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">comment:12</div>

Analogously, why

```
getattr(exc_cls, '__qualname__', exc_cls.__name__)
```
instead of

```
exc_cls.__qualname__
```
Are there any cases where `__qualname__` wouldn't exist?

For both the `__module__` check and `__qualname__` check: the Python standard `traceback` module doesn't do anything fancy here, it just uses the `__qualname__` and `__module__` attributes as-is. If that's good enough for the `traceback` module, it should be good enough for Sage.

Right, I missed that.
