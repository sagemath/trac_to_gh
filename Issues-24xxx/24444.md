At present differential forms are dealt with by different and incompatible parts of Sage: the [CoordinatePatch version](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/tensor/sage/tensor/differential_form_element.html) (implemented in #9650) and the [manifold version](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/diff_form.html)
(implemented in #18843).

All functionalities of the CoordinatePatch version (like wedge product and exterior derivative) are implemented in the manifold version, but the manifold one is more recent and provides more functionalities, like

- better display capabilities
- changing the coordinates (the CoordinatePatch version assumes a fixed coordinate system)
- evaluating the Lie derivative with respect to a vector field
- performing the interior product with a p-vector
- evaluating the Hodge dual with respect to a metric

It is also more flexible:

- the indices may be chosen to start from 1 (or any other value) instead of 0
- one may use index notation with Einstein convention of summation on repeated indices
- the base ring is not limited to the Symbolic Ring.

As this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40345/differential-forms-best-package/) reveals, keeping both versions is confusing and the current ticket is devoted to deprecate the CoordinatePatch version.

<a id='comment:1'></a>**Illustration of similarities and differences**

Let us declare a differential form of degree 2 with the CoordinatePatch version:

```
sage: x, y, z = var('x, y, z')
sage: U = CoordinatePatch((x, y, z))
sage: F = DifferentialForms(U)
sage: f = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: f[0,1] = x*sin(z)
sage: f[1,2] = y*z
sage: f
x*sin(z)*dx/\dy + y*z*dy/\dz
```
To perform the same thing with the manifold version, one should write (using a different Sage session to avoid any confusion):

```
sage: U = Manifold(3, 'U')
sage: X.<x,y,z> = U.chart()
sage: f = U.diff_form(2, 'f')
sage: f[0,1] = x*sin(z)
sage: f[1,2] = y*z
sage: f
2-form f on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.display()
f = x*sin(z) dx/\dy + y*z dy/\dz
```
Let us introduce another differential form, as a 1-form; in the CoordinatePatch version:

```
sage: g = DifferentialForm(F, 1)
sage: g[0], g[1], g[2] = (y^2, -z, 2*x-y)
sage: g
(2*x - y)*dz + y^2*dx + -z*dy
```
In the manifold version, one may use the shortcut notation `g[:]` to set the components of `g`:

```
sage: g = U.diff_form(1, 'g')
sage: g[:] = (y^2, -z, 2*x-y)
sage: g.display()
g = y^2 dx - z dy + (2*x - y) dz
```
The wedge product of `f` by `g` is obtained in the same way in both methods: for CoordinatePatch:

```
sage: f.wedge(g)
(y^3*z + (2*x - y)*x*sin(z))*dx/\dy/\dz
```
while for the manifold version:

```
sage: f.wedge(g)
3-form f/\g on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.wedge(g).display()
f/\g = (y^3*z + (2*x^2 - x*y)*sin(z)) dx/\dy/\dz
```
The exterior derivative is computed via the method `diff()` in the CoordinatePatch version:

```
sage: f.diff()
x*cos(z)*dx/\dy/\dz
```
and via the method `exterior_derivative()` in the manifold version:

```
sage: f.exterior_derivative().display()
df = x*cos(z) dx/\dy/\dz
```
A shortcut is provided by the function `xder`, to be used as the operator d to compute df:

```
sage: from sage.manifolds.utilities import xder
sage: xder(f) == f.exterior_derivative()
True
```
A difference regards the parents: in the CoordinatePatch version, the 2-form `f` and the 1-form `g` have the same parent, which is the graded algebra Omega(U) of all differential forms defined on U, and declared as `F = DifferentialForms(U)` at the beginning of the session:

```
sage: f.parent()
Algebra of differential forms in the variables x, y, z
sage: f.parent() is F
True
sage: g.parent() is F
True
```
In the manifold case, the parent of `f` is the set Omega<sup>2</sup>(U) of 2-forms on U, which is considered as a free module of rank 3 on the algebra C<sup>oo</sup>(U) of scalar fields on U, while the parent of `g` is the set Omega<sup>1</sup>(U) of 1-forms on U, which is considered as another free module of rank 3 on C<sup>oo</sup>(U):

```
sage: f.parent()
Free module Omega^2(U) of 2-forms on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.parent().base_ring()
Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.parent().rank()
3
sage: g.parent()
Free module Omega^1(U) of 1-forms on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: g.parent().rank()
3
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>**Examples of functionalities avalaible only in the manifold version
**

The capability to access directly to the coordinate basis 1-forms:

```
sage: X.coframe()
Coordinate coframe (U, (dx,dy,dz))
sage: dx = X.coframe()[0]
sage: dy = X.coframe()[1]
sage: a = sin(z)*dx.wedge(dy)
sage: a.display()
sin(z) dx/\dy
```

The interior product with a vector field:

```
sage: v = U.vector_field('v')
sage: v[:] = (-y, z, x^2)
sage: v.interior_product(f)
1-form i_v f on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: v.interior_product(f).display()
i_v f = -x*z*sin(z) dx + (-x^2*y*z - x*y*sin(z)) dy + y*z^2 dz
```
The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field:

```
sage: f.lie_derivative(v)
2-form on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.lie_derivative(v).display()
(x^3*cos(z) - 2*x*y*z - y*sin(z)) dx/\dy + x*sin(z) dx/\dz + (x^2*y + z^2) dy/\dz
```
As an illustration, we may check that Cartan's identity Lie<sub>v</sub> f = d(i<sub>v</sub> f) + i<sub>v</sub> df  holds:

```
sage: f.lie_derivative(v) == (v.interior_product(f)).exterior_derivative() + \
....:                        v.interior_product(f.exterior_derivative())
True
```
Computing the Hodge dual with respect to a given metric:

```
sage: h = U.metric('h')
sage: h[0,0] = 1+y^2
sage: h[1,1] = 1+z^2
sage: h[2,2] = 1+x^2
sage: h.display()
h = (y^2 + 1) dx*dx + (z^2 + 1) dy*dy + (x^2 + 1) dz*dz
sage: f.hodge_dual(h)
1-form *f on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold U
sage: f.hodge_dual(h).display()
*f = sqrt(y^2 + 1)*y*z/(sqrt(x^2 + 1)*sqrt(z^2 + 1)) dx + sqrt(x^2 + 1)*x*sin(z)/(sqrt(y^2 + 1)*sqrt(z^2 + 1)) dz
```
Computing new components under a change of coordinates:

```
sage: X2.<u,v,w> = U.chart()
sage: X_to_X2 = X.transition_map(X2, [y+z, z+x, x+y])
sage: X_to_X2.inverse()
Change of coordinates from Chart (U, (u, v, w)) to Chart (U, (x, y, z))
sage: g.display()  # the default for g.display(X.frame(), X)
g = y^2 dx - z dy + (2*x - y) dz
sage: g.display(X2.frame(), X2)
g = (-1/8*u^2 + 1/4*(u + 2)*v - 1/8*v^2 - 1/4*(u - v - 2)*w - 1/8*w^2 - u) du + (1/8*u^2 - 1/4*(u - 4)*v + 1/8*v^2 + 1/4*(u - v)*w + 1/8*w^2 - 1/2*u) dv + (1/8*u^2 - 1/4*(u + 4)*v + 1/8*v^2 + 1/4*(u - v)*w + 1/8*w^2 + 1/2*u) dw
```
Using the function `display_comp`, which is more convenient for lengthy expressions:

```
sage: g.display_comp()   # the default for g.display_comp(X.frame(), X)
g_x = y^2
g_y = -z
g_z = 2*x - y
sage: g.display_comp(X2.frame(), X2)
g_u = -1/8*u^2 + 1/4*(u + 2)*v - 1/8*v^2 - 1/4*(u - v - 2)*w - 1/8*w^2 - u
g_v = 1/8*u^2 - 1/4*(u - 4)*v + 1/8*v^2 + 1/4*(u - v)*w + 1/8*w^2 - 1/2*u
g_w = 1/8*u^2 - 1/4*(u + 4)*v + 1/8*v^2 + 1/4*(u - v)*w + 1/8*w^2 + 1/2*u
```
