This avoids a nasty import at startup of `matrix.matrix_space` in polynomial rings.

I'm adding a dependency on #24947 which is technically not needed, but it makes it easier to merge things in #24742.

Depends on #24947

This is very bad. I am very much in favor of something like Marc suggested

```
try:
   threshold = base_ring._karatsuba_threshold
except AttributeError:
    threshold = 0
```
that would not depend on some startup effect.
