Over complex numbers, you can take norms of matrices:

```
sage: A = matrix(CC,2,2,[1,2,3,4])
sage: A.norm(infinity)
7.0
```
It would make sense to do something for p-adic matrices, though the options should probably be different (the most common use case would be just the maximum absolute value of any entry).
