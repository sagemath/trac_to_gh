Both `Expression.solve(...)` and global `solve(...)` use Maxima for solving (in)equalities but use their own code which agrees in part, and provide some of the same options.  The first allows univariate forms/relations, the second additionally systems, and several variables. Further differences are e.g. that only `solve` makes several attempts.

In order to give users the full capabilities, regardless how called, and to ease maintenance and addition of improvements, this ticket should move the `ex.solve` code into `solve`, leaving only an interface to it. It will throughout use maxima-lib. No doctest should be in need of change, except for improved output.

That's not true. Look at the graph code for a "real world" example, but basically, it does this:

```python
sage: def bar(self, x):  # Say this was in a separate file
....:     return self._y + x
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     _y = 10
....:     bar = bar
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.bar(5)

Calling itself is not necessary and it's easy to rewrite without this call. While I agree with having structure in the doctests, they serve as highly visible example when a user inputs `solve?`. Separating them makes them partly inaccessible.

Please review.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Thanks. Although I think it would be better for the `is_Expression(f)` case to be a separate function within `relation.py`, say

```python
def _solve_expression(f, x, explicit_solutions, multiplicities, to_poly_solve, solution_dict):
   """
   Solve an expression ``f``. For more information, see :func:`solve`.

   TESTS:

   Only tests that check :trac:`ABCDE` is fixed::

This gives better localization of (relevant) tests, does not introduce any doc issues (it is mainly an implementation detail), and can be called with your already parsed input. If you do not agree, then what you currently have is acceptable. Yet, it is quite a big function, and I feel it is more maintainable in smaller bites.
