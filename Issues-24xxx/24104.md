Both `Expression.solve(...)` and global `solve(...)` use Maxima for solving (in)equalities but use their own code which agrees in part, and provide some of the same options.  The first allows univariate forms/relations, the second additionally systems, and several variables. Further differences are e.g. that only `solve` makes several attempts.

In order to give users the full capabilities, regardless how called, and to ease maintenance and addition of improvements, this ticket should move the `ex.solve` code into `solve`, leaving only an interface to it. It will throughout use maxima-lib. No doctest should be in need of change, except for improved output.

We can be a bit more concise, which IMO is more readable:

```diff
-        for i in x:
-            if not isinstance(i, Expression):
-                raise TypeError("%s is not a valid variable." % repr(i))
+        if not all(isinstance(i, Expression) for i in x):
+            raise TypeError("%s is not a valid variable" % repr(i))
```

I feel like the handling of `f` being a single expression should be a separate function that is called by `solve` but still in the same file. It always returns something and is effectively called later in `solve` in special cases. IMO, this makes it easier to understand and maintain with independent doctests.

I am tempted to keep it as a method of `Expression`, but I agree overall with the purpose of the ticket to have a uniform interface and behavior. This change also gives better code grouping. However, with the current branch, I don't feel like the two functions have been merged as they feel somewhat separate as per my comments above. Your thoughts and counters?

That's not true. Look at the graph code for a "real world" example, but basically, it does this:

```python
sage: def bar(self, x):  # Say this was in a separate file
....:     return self._y + x
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     _y = 10
....:     bar = bar
sage: F = Foo()
sage: F.bar(5)
15
```

Calling itself is not necessary and it's easy to rewrite without this call. While I agree with having structure in the doctests, they serve as highly visible example when a user inputs `solve?`. Separating them makes them partly inaccessible.

Please review.

Thanks. Although I think it would be better for the `is_Expression(f)` case to be a separate function within `relation.py`, say

```python
def _solve_expression(f, x, explicit_solutions, multiplicities, to_poly_solve, solution_dict):
   """
   Solve an expression ``f``. For more information, see :func:`solve`.

   TESTS:

   Only tests that check :trac:`ABCDE` is fixed::
   """
   # Code here
```
This gives better localization of (relevant) tests, does not introduce any doc issues (it is mainly an implementation detail), and can be called with your already parsed input. If you do not agree, then what you currently have is acceptable. Yet, it is quite a big function, and I feel it is more maintainable in smaller bites. I can also do that refactoring too if you'd want.
