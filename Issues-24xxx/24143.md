After upgrading my glibc version, zeromq no longer compiles. See https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2817

However, this is just a manifestation of a deeper problem: zeromq uses `-Werror` which is a stupid idea. This ticket is for undoing that flag. See https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2818 for the rationale.
