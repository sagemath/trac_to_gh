The ticket implements an idea from #24428 to allow symbolic functions to always extend their domain when necessary, in order to return the most information from the call.

Practically if the `extend_for()` attribute of the `Function` exists it is called with the function arguments. If returned `True` then, instead of trying `x.func()` we try `parent.complex_field(x).func()`.
