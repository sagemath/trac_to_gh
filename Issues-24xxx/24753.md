Fixes most/all bytes/str issues in `sage.repl.rich_output`.  In particular, this is an important counterpart to #24343, since without it most tests fail trivially due to incorrect treatment of bytes in the doctest output backend.

The most significant change in this branch is the addition of a new method: `OutputBuffer.get_str()`.  This is plays a similar role to `bytes_to_str`, in that on Python 2 it is equivalent to `OutputBuffer.get()`, and on Python 3 it is equivalent to `OutputBuffer.get_unicode()`.  In order for this code to work consistently across Python 2 and Python 3, most places that called `OutputBuffer.get()` are changed to use `OutputBuffer.get_str()` (except for some cases where we explicitly want `bytes` output, such as with binary data).

I'm happy to split this change off to a separate ticket from the other minor fixes if so demanded...
