On one hand, we might still want to test `__cmp__` with this code on Python 2.  On the other hand, I think we'll be replacing most/all `__cmp__` methods anyways, so maybe it doesn't matter.  The comparison implementation itself is also not critical to how `UniqueRepresentation` works.

I'm fine with either way.

That did seem out of place to me as well.  Beyond `__eq__` the talk of other comparison operators doesn't seem relevant, but I wasn't sure.

To be clear, you're just talking about the second example, and ensuing discussion of comparison methods, right?  In the first example the `__eq__`, at least, is still necessary.

I ask just because, while I understand what this class does on its own, I wasn't sure if there was some subtlety of how it's used in Sage that necessitated this documentation.

> It's also superfluous since that's how subclassing in Python works in general.

I agree that it's superfluous, but so is a lot of the other text in there. I figured it was worth pointing out for those who aren't completely comfortable how subclassing works w.r.t. comparisons (heck, I'm not even completely comfortable with it, if recent experience dictates).

So it's saying "these objects have this specific type of behavior when it comes to identity comparisons, but may still have any other behavior w.r.t. ordering behavior".  But I don't think it's too important to say that either.
