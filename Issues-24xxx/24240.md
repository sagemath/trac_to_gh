[ Title modified at `novoselt`'s suggestion ] :

Motivation : in Sage 8.1.rc2, R can't plot (at least on Debian testing, whose X is Wayland by default) :

```
> capabilities()
       jpeg         png        tiff       tcltk         X11        aqua

   http/ftp     sockets      libxml        fifo      cledit       iconv

        NLS     profmem       cairo         ICU long.double     libcurl 
       TRUE       FALSE       FALSE        TRUE        TRUE        TRUE 
Warning message:
In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) :
  impossible de charger l'objet partagÃ© '/usr/local/sage-8/local/lib/R//modules//R_X11.so':
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libharfbuzz.so.0: undefined symbol: FT_Get_Var_Blend_Coordinates
> q("no")
```

Contrast with the system's R :

```

Precisely what it means : `capabilities()` show that all the imaging engines of R(`jpeg, png, tiff, tcltk, X11, cairo`) are disabled. In a terminal, `plot(<something>)` does nothing and yelds an error mess`age from X11, which complaints of a missing function in a library called harfbuzz`. Similar results in the Jupyter notebook.

This might been due to recent changes in system's X11 (Debian now uses Wayland by default), which might have triggered an hitherto unknown bug.

It turns out that updating `freetype` to 2.8.1 fixes the problem.

The resulting Sage passes ptestlong without any error whatsoever ; R sirt-of-passing its own test suite as usual.

==>`needs_review`. I'll try to test it on Windows (but that means an overnight run...)

It should. I considered it. But I doubt somehow that this opinion would be shared by the core developers, given the popularity of R among them...

Do you run Xorg or Wayland ? I'm running testing, where X11 defaults to Wayland : that might be the source of the diffeernces in vbehaviour.

Can you plot from a terminal running "sage -R" ? For example, try "curve(sin(x), -pi, pi)".

Using graphics in the R librar interface from Sage is a bit more intricate. More on this later...

I can as in it does not cause errors and there is a PDF file created with a plot. I am far from being an expert on the topic - my only interest in R graphics is to make sure that it keeps working for SageMathCell.

Download the tarball linked in the description and place it into `upstream`. Or is that not what you meant?

Edit: Oh, you mean the patchbots. I have heard that they are supposed to do this somehow, but I don't know if that's true.

Apparently, one of them [did](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/24240/) early this morning. But it seems to have just patched the sources (successfully), but didn't try to rebuild Sage.
