[ Title modified at `novoselt`'s suggestion ] :

Motivation : in Sage 8.1.rc2, R can't plot (at least on Debian testing, whose X is Wayland by default) :

Precisely what it means : `capabilities()` show that all the imaging engines of R(`jpeg, png, tiff, tcltk, X11, cairo`) are disabled. In a terminal, `plot(<something>)` does nothing and yelds an error mess`age from X11, which complaints of a missing function in a library called harfbuzz`. Similar results in the Jupyter notebook.

This might been due to recent changes in system's X11 (Debian now uses Wayland by default), which might have triggered an hitherto unknown bug.

It turns out that updating `freetype` to 2.8.1 fixes the problem.

The resulting Sage passes ptestlong without any error whatsoever ; R sirt-of-passing its own test suite as usual.

It should. I considered it. But I doubt somehow that this opinion would be shared by the core developers, given the popularity of R among them...

Anyway, feel free to review my patch ;-).

Do you run Xorg or Wayland ? I'm running testing, where X11 defaults to Wayland : that might be the source of the diffeernces in vbehaviour.

Can you plot from a terminal running "sage -R" ? For example, try "curve(sin(x), -pi, pi)".

Using graphics in the R librar interface from Sage is a bit more intricate. More on this later...

I am on stable, so presumably Xorg.

I can as in it does not cause errors and there is a PDF file created with a plot. I am far from being an expert on the topic - my only interest in R graphics is to make sure that it keeps working for SageMathCell.

Download the tarball linked in the description and place it into `upstream`. Or is that not what you meant?

Edit: Oh, you mean the patchbots. I have heard that they are supposed to do this somehow, but I don't know if that's true.
