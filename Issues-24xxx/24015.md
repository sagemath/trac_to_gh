there is also an error in poly.c, where a non-void function returns nothing.
This is trivially fixed by

As it was being fixed, more problems were uncovered, and then a pesky GC bug, that went away after adding an explicit `GC_INIT()` call.

It appears that all is fixed by https://github.com/miguelmarco/libhomfly/pull/11

<a id='comment:6'></a>the last remaining problem was the lack of `GC_INIT()` call in the library (something that is apparently not needed on Linux, but the docs
say that that some platforms might need it...)

With https://github.com/miguelmarco/libhomfly/pull/11
it is all fixed, also on the current Sage's GC version on OSX.

<a id='comment:7'></a>NB: the tarball is just a proof of concept, corresponding to commit b68b5b2aac2e89b17312208080562f5754d3da2d
on https://github.com/dimpase/libhomfly

Once the upstream is done with merging, we should get the official tarball...
