<a id='comment:4'></a>Some doc nitpicks:

```
        r"""
        Return a list of all submodules of ``self``.

        .. WARNING::

            The number of submodules grows very fast and this method
            creates all of them in memory.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: D = IntegralLattice("D4").discriminant_group()
            sage: D.all_submodules()
            [Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants ()
              Gram matrix of the quadratic form with values in Q/2Z:
              [],
             Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants (2,)
              Gram matrix of the quadratic form with values in Q/2Z:
              [1],
             Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants (2,)
              Gram matrix of the quadratic form with values in Q/2Z:
              [1],
             Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants (2,)
              Gram matrix of the quadratic form with values in Q/2Z:
              [1],
             Finite quadratic module over Integer Ring with invariants (2, 2)
              Gram matrix of the quadratic form with values in Q/2Z:
              [  1 1/2]
              [1/2   1]]
        """
```
Do you also have some idea about "very fast" (quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Otherwise LGTM.
