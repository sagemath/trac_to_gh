Since it is usually infeasible to compute all reduced words of a permutation, an iterator may be more convenient.

As a side effect, the performance is also a bit better.  Old:

```
sage: %timeit [len(pi.reduced_words()) for pi in Permutations(6)]
1 loop, best of 3: 42.3 s per loop
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.2.beta1, Release Date: 2017-12-22'
```

New:

```
sage: %timeit [len(pi.reduced_words()) for pi in Permutations(6)]
1 loop, best of 3: 4.9 s per loop
```
