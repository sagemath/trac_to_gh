For example after `X = list(Posets(8))` compare

```
sum(1 for P in X if P.is_incomparable_chain_free([(1,3),(2,2)]))
sum(1 for P in X if P.is_incomparable_chain_free([(2,2),(1,4)]))
```

So it makes sense to always sort the list. Also there is no need for to call the same function.

How about we pull the `self._hasse_diagram.transitive_closure()` outside of the for loop so it is only called once?

This is a desing issue. What should `is_incomparable_chain_free([])` return? Currently for example `is_antichain_of_poset([])` return `True`, but it is slightly different case.

No, what I mean is we should not create the transitive closure if `chain_pairs` is empty (which is a very quick test).

> What should `is_incomparable_chain_free([])` return? Currently for example `is_antichain_of_poset([])` return `True`, but it is slightly different case.


The current and changed behavior is to return `True`, so that can be for a separate ticket if you want. I have no real preference and do not think it really matters theory-wise.
