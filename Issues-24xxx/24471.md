The `OptionalExtension` mechanism (see `src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py`) allows for Cython modules to be cythonized but not compiled by distutils (by some logic in the `sage_build_ext` build command).

This can cause problems in the following scenario:

1. Install some optional package

2. Build Cython module depending on that optional package

3. Try to re-install that optional package (for example, because of an upgrade) but the installation fails for some reason.

4. Build the Sage library. This will just ignore the module from step 2: the old (outdated) copy will be kept.

5. Run Sage. If the module from step 2 can still be imported, assorted breakage can occur.

This ticket aims to fix step 4: the outdated built module should be removed by the cleaning system `clean_install_dir()`. This is easy to accomplish by removing those modules from `ext_modules`.

Makes sense to me.  It might be nice to have a test for this but that would involve adding more tests for `sage_setup` in general--something I know we've been meaning to do for a while.

The problem is that it's not really possible to test `sage_setup` without `setup.py`. So that would require that most logic of `setup.py` would be moved to the `sage_setup` module such that it can be imported for testing. I agree that this makes sense, but not for this ticket.
