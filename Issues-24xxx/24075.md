This test uses the elliptic curve with Cremona label 274627a1 which is in the optional database, and has rank 1.  Anyone running the test without the database will be computing the rank and that cannot be done using defaults (i.e. just doing E.rank()) as the generator is quite large.  Those people seeing this fault probably have the database installed, so that the rank is set to 1 when te curve is created.

We can switch the test to a curve of conductor >400000, or manually set its rank to 1 using E._set_rank().  Or we can make this test optional on have the large database installed.

I would like to use a different curve which is not in any database.

I'll try to come up with one -- it should have rank 1 but E.rank() should fail to give that.

Try this:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,-1,0,-1228,-16267])
sage: E.conductor()
99982889
sage: E.heegner_index(-8)
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=0).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.
Try calling something like two_descent(second_limit=13) on the
curve then trying this command again.  You could also try rank
with only_use_mwrank=False.

RuntimeError: Rank not provably correct.
sage: E.heegner_index(-8, descent_second_limit=16, check_rank=False)

```

I only put the conductor line in to show that this is beyond the database.  (Sorry, it is in Stein-Watkins.)  Note that the correct Heegner index is 2 not 1 as in the other example.

I'll look for an example outside SW if you want but not right now.

Hi John, 

Just in case you want to have some help interpreting failing patchbots sometime in the future: on #23832 there is a list of known failures for patchbots, there is also a link to it called "metaticket for patchbot failures" on trac.sagemath.org .The reason we considered this ticket a blocker is because it was also causing patchbots to fail and thereby hindering the sage development process.
