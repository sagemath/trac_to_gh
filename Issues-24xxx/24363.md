As an effort to reduce the number of entry points to the "element constructor" (see #23880), get rid of `_populate_coercion_lists_(element_constructor=...)`. Instead, set an `Element` attribute or implement an `_element_constructor_` method.

Unpickling still calls `_populate_coercion_lists_(element_constructor=...)` and we are not fixing this for now.

Can you explain why in some cases you did:

```
_element_constructor_ = integer.Integer
```
and for others you used `Element`? Is it for speed reasons (in particular, avoiding a level of indirection), coupled with the fact the elements are extension classes?

Otherwise everything else LGTM (although I would like to see, e.g., `BrandtModuleElement._add_` use `type(self)` instead of `BrandtModuleElement` as forward-proofing, but I only noticed that because the code simply moved locations and is unrelated to this ticket).

The reason is that most element classes take the parent as argument. So the default `_element_constructor_` method passes the parent to the element class. For `ZZ`, the parent is constant, so it is not passed in the `Integer` constructor. So I need a custom `_element_constructor_` "method".

Here it is not actually a method but a class used as callable object. I could wrap it in a method, but it works this way so I didn't do that.

Indeed. If you do

```
class BrandtModule_class(AmbientHeckeModule):
    Element = BrandtModuleElement
```
you need to define `BrandtModuleElement` before `BrandtModule_class`.

I think what you did is the most sensible way (at least that I can see).

Not strictly speaking, as you can do `BrandtModule_class.Element = BrandtModuleElement` later on down at the module-level, but that is quite ugly IMO.
