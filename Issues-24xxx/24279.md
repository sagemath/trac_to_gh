This is great - I had completely forgotten, that you had made #24170!

I've just played around with the `vector_space()` method, and there's one thing confusing me: it seems that the returned vector space representation is unique, as in only created once even if `vector_space` is called multiple timpes, but I can't seem to figure out why:

```
sage: F = GF(2^25)
sage: Fbig = F.extension(10)
sage: V = Fbig.vector_space(F)
sage: V2 = Fbig.vector_space(F)
sage: V is V2
True
```

Why is it confusing? This is normal behavior:

```
sage: F**2 is F**2
True
sage: F**2
Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z25 of size 2^25
```

Ah, now I see. I was confused. The vector space you return is simply a normal vector space as in `F**2`. What's special is the maps you compute, and the matrices stored in these - and they are *not* unique. In other words, every time you call `vector_space`, these matrices will be recomputed.

As was the case with `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension`, if this `vector_space` is used somewhere inside an object, across multiple method calls to that object, then it's the objects' job to store those maps as private fields.

This is a bit inelegant, but I guess something for the future, and not really relevant to this ticket. The solution we had envisioned in #21413, but where we admittedly didn't get far, would use an algebra-representation (instead of just a vector space), and this parent would store those maps inside it.

Right.

It is so now.

I don't have a clear idea on this issue. I just feel that instead of inventing extensions as in #21413, using (or improving if necessary) the general conversion mechanism in Sage is better. So a "conversion model" keeps all those maps and return one when requested...

-The ticket #24170 took the core functionality of `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` class (introduced in #20284) into an improved `vector_space` method of finite fields. The intention was to provide an easily accessible interface for the functionality. 
-
-This ticket completely removes uses of `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` class, mainly in the coding theory modules,  from Sage, and hence also remove the experimental class itself.
+This ticket removes the experimental class `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` that is currently only used in the coding theory modules.
