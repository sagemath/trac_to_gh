I've just played around with the `vector_space()` method, and there's one thing confusing me: it seems that the returned vector space representation is unique, as in only created once even if `vector_space` is called multiple timpes, but I can't seem to figure out why:

```
sage: F = GF(2^25)
sage: Fbig = F.extension(10)
sage: V = Fbig.vector_space(F)
sage: V2 = Fbig.vector_space(F)
sage: V is V2
True

Why is it confusing? This is normal behavior:

```
sage: F**2 is F**2
True
sage: F**2
Vector space of dimension 2 over Finite Field in z25 of size 2^25
```

Right.

It is so now.

I don't have a clear idea on this issue. I just feel that instead of inventing extensions as in #21413, using (or improving if necessary) the general conversion mechanism in Sage is better. So a "conversion model" keeps all those maps and return one when requested...
