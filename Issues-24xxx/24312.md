I felt it might be important to make sure these functions were working properly, as some of Sage's metaprogramming and related tests rely on reliable introspection.

A number of the tests in this module only made sense on Python 2 due to minor syntactic differences or similar minor differences between the languages; in some cases I provided Python 3 alternatives, in other cases the test is just run on Python 2.  In still other cases I changed the test slightly to work on both, where I felt that it didn't impact the validity of the test.

Please explain why it "has to happen anyways". Do you intend to replace

```
class X(object)

That's a tricky question, probably for discussion elsewhere (that is, if it requires further discussion I'll just remove the change from this ticket for now).  I don't think it needs to be changed *everywhere* but for the purposes of *tests* that are the same on Python 2 and Python 3 old-style classes often won't work (if nothing else their repr is different), and I would prefer to standardize on new-style classes.

For the record: I agree. It's just that we should continue to support old-style classes on Python 2. So if a test is specifically meant to test old-style classes, it should be kept.

If you are in Orsay, please talk to Nicolas about this. He usually insists on using and supporting old-style classes.

Speaking of which, it turns out that change *was* relevant to this ticket, because one of the tests in sageinspect uses `TestNestedParent` from that module.  The only reason I can tell that its even in a separate module is that it's related to testing `sage_getsource`.

And no, it's not meant to test old-style classes.  That's what I was saying.  It would be easier to see this if we had actual test coverage analysis for Sage but this change is irrelevant to the test.

I'm not convinced. The test is meant to test the pattern

```
class NewStyle(...):
    class Element:
        ...
```
which occurs a lot in Sage. It's not obvious to me why it doesn't matter if `Element` is a new-style or old-style class.

In this case the *only* reason was because there was some part of the test that checked the repr of the nested class, and new-style and old-style classes have different reprs :(

Alternatively I could add a fixup for this to the doctest parser as I've done in other cases.  This isn't the only example I've found like this.  It's usually just simpler to convert to a new-style class except in the miniscule number cases where that has an impact on what's being tested.

Just to clarify, let me elaborate on that. I am not specifically keen on old-style classes per se. In fact, if there would be an easy way to "configure" Python so that

```
    class A:
        ...
```
would always create a new style class, that would be very fine.

On the other hand, we have quite some of code in Sage *and* outside of Sage (in packages or users private code) that use the idiom:

```
    class A(...):
        class Element:
            ...
```

It would not be a practical to have to change this everywhere to

```
    class A(...):
        class Element(object):
            ...
```
when anyway that won't be needed anymore with Python 3.

Cheers,

`inspect.getargspec` is not used in any of the code, only in some of the doctests  The reason to keep it is that the output of `sage_getargspec` is the same as the output of `inspect.getargspec` and this tests that that is the case.

The only alternative would be to change `sage_getargspec` to be equivalent to `inspect.getfullargspec` which has no equivalent on Python 2, and then have separate tests for Python 2 and 3.  I'd be okay with that, but it's a slightly larger change.

Weird, but I see what you're saying.  This code originally had `hasattr(obj, '__metaclass__')` and you changed it to this.  Let me make sure there isn't some reason I felt I had to change that.

As the commit message says, this line was originally trying to be *too* precise.  It was trying to handle a case like:

    {{{
    #!python
    class SomeCategory(Category):
        class ParentMethods:
            pass
    }}}

then calling `sage_getsource(SomeCategory.parent_class)` where `parent_class` is a `DynamicMetaclass`.  In this case it would go through `SomeCategory.parent_class._sage_src_lines_()` which in turn would look up the source lines for the actual class `SomeCategory.ParentMethods`, which on Python 2 was an old-style class.

So this code was really just trying to catch exactly any case where we had either an old-style class, or a class with a custom metaclass.  But really there's no reason for that restriction.  All that actually matters is that it's a class (of any type) with a dotted name.
