<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
I see. In Python 2, `range()` automatically calls `int()` on the arguments:

```
sage: range(1.5, 6.5)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Python 3 uses `__index__` which is obviously better.

This is not a harmless change:

```diff
-        return self.eval_helper(max_symbolic, builtin_max, None, args)
+        return self.eval_helper(max_symbolic, builtin_max, float('-inf'), args)
```
Instead, I think you just need to handle `None` in `eval_helper`. In particular in this line:

```
res = builtin_f(res, x)
```

Second, I would just remove the doctests involving `None` where you added `# py2`. Those tests seem rather silly. But it's fine if you want to keep them.

Everything else is fine.
