As discussed on sage-devel, I'm fairly consistently (roughly 9 times out of 10) getting the following failure on Cygwin:

```
sage -t --warn-long 164.8 src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx", line 786, in
sage.structure.coerce_actions.IntegerMulAction._repr_name_
Failed example:
    IntegerMulAction(ZZ, GF5)

    Left Integer Multiplication by Integer Ring on Finite Field of size 5
Got:

1 item had failures:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --warn-long 164.8 src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx  # 1

```

Obviously Sage doesn't even allow creation of an order 1 field.  In fact, I traced the cause of this to a *specific* line in `FiniteFieldFactory.create_key_and_extra_args` where, by chance, an `Integer` with a value of `1` is constructed (using `fast_tp_new`) whose `(mp_limb*)(Integer.value._mp_d)` member is assigned the same address as the `_mp_d` of the `Integer` that happens to hold the field's order.

The result is that the `order` is then set to `1` as well.  This happens *after* the check that `order>1` so creation of the field still succeeds.  Clearly there is a subtle bug either in `fast_tp_new`, or in the memory allocator itself.

Depends on #27073

> We should also consider the possibility of a bug in Cygwin, as this has not been observed on other platforms.

Yep, I agree. Though I think there's also a possibility of a subtle bug.  The code around which this is happening looks like this:

```python
            order = Integer(order)
            if order <= 1:
                raise ValueError("the order of a finite field must be at least 2")

            if order.is_prime():
                p = order
                n = Integer(1)
```

It's the last line, `n = Integer(1)` where that `Integer` has the same `_mp_d` as `order` for some reason.  Also in this case `order` is already passed in as an `Integer`, so I'm wondering if there's some subtle bug around `order = Integer(order)`.

Aha! I put some code in `fast_tp_dealloc` to check, before returning an `Integer` to the pool, if there is already an entry in the pool with the same `_mp_d`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if so.  And this condition first occurs in earlier test in the same module:

```

The presence of `alarm()` also explains the slight randomness of this error.  So it seems that somewhere the allocation/deallocation of integers not safe to interruption by a signal...

 This same process works correctly on Linux though, which is still suspicious.

2. If I remove the following lines from `fast_tp_dealloc` the problem appears to go away:

```python
        # Here we free any extra memory used by the mpz_t by

 so it's possible also something fishy is happening with `_mpz_realloc`.

It would be good to know exactly which code is executing when the interrupt/alarm happens.

There are two ways to find out:

1. Run Python under `gdb`

2. Using `cysignals` assume that Cygwin has a `backtrace()` function. You'll need to recompile `cysignals` with debugging. Within Sage, it suffices to do

```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f cysignals
```

After rebuilding with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` (mostly--singular is failing its debug builds for some reason, which is something I'll have to investigate another time), I can no longer reproduce the problem, which is disconcerting.  I confirmed that the Sage modules compiled with `-O0`.

For reference's sake, with the `alarm(0.5)`  (and actually with other values as well, such as `alarm(1)`), the `AlarmInterrupt` is almost always raised from the same place:

On occasion it's elsewhere, but most of the time it's in that shift call.  To learn much else I'll have to drop into gdb, but first I'll have to rebuild some modules with `-O(>0)` and see if the problem returns...

It looks like it's being interrupted in the `_mpz_realloc` call from `mpz_mul_2exp(z.value, self.value, n)`, on the just-created `Integer` "z".

I *think* I see the general problem here.  The function `_mpz_realloc` is not interrupt-safe.  Even with GMP's realloc set to `sig_realloc`, that just blocks signals before/after the actual `realloc`.  However, it's then only after `realloc` succeeds that the `_mp_d` pointer gets updated.  If the signal handler is invoked before that happens then the old value in `_mp_d` might now point to a freed address (in fact, and address to a size=1 array of limbs).

Then, as `fast_mul` is cleaned up it again frees an integer (the variable "n").  This is a large integer so it trips the semi-arbitrary condition:

```python
        # Here we free any extra memory used by the mpz_t by
        # setting it to a single limb.
        if o_mpz._mp_alloc > 10:
            _mpz_realloc(o_mpz, 1)
```

and this `realloc` happens to give back the same `size=1` array that was previously just freed.  So both `_mp_d` end up with the same pointer.

This isn't usually a problem, because in most cases we have Cysignals turned on, which means an exception is raised and, in most cases (but not all--therein is still a problem) the computation is aborted and the relevant datastructures are cleaned up anyways and it doesn't entirely matter if they're consistent or not (here there is still a potential for double-frees and the like, and that would be a bug too, albeit a slightly different one).

When it comes to the integer pool that's not the case, because instead of completely cleaning up and destroying the relevant data structures, we're always assuming that when an `Integer` is returned to the pool that it's in a sane, consistent state (or at the very least, that its `_mp_d` pointer is still valid).

The deeper underlying problem here is not the bug.  The bug is that the integer pool makes it too easy to keep around invalid datastructures.

I see what you are trying to say, but I don't agree. I believe that "completely cleaning up and destroying the relevant data structures" is equally unsafe as reusing that data structure. In other words, instead of getting in trouble when reusing the `mpz_t`, you will instead get in trouble when calling `mpz_clear()` on it.

cysignals could run a gc cycle after interrupt and have a boolean flag to tell c/cython code that we are currently in this "dangerous" gc cycle. This seems to be a reasonable cysignals feature, allowing users to react to possibly inconsistent C data structueres. 

The integer pool could use that to not recycle `mpz_t`.

Many interesting `mpz` functions take time at least linear in the size of the input. Since we want to support large integers, they can all take a long time.

Perhaps the only obvious example to apply `sig_block()`/`sig_unblock()` to would be `mpz_init()`.

This doesn't quite work yet because `sig_occurred()` is being called with a live exception. Since `sig_occurred()` may call `gc.collect()`, this means trouble.

Really, `sig_occurred` should check for `PyErr_Occurred()` which is both an optimization and a protection against doing GC with an exception set.
