As discussed on sage-devel, I'm fairly consistently (roughly 9 times out of 10) getting the following failure on Cygwin:

```

Obviously Sage doesn't even allow creation of an order 1 field.  In fact, I traced the cause of this to a *specific* line in `FiniteFieldFactory.create_key_and_extra_args` where, by chance, an `Integer` with a value of `1` is constructed (using `fast_tp_new`) whose `(mp_limb*)(Integer.value._mp_d)` member is assigned the same address as the `_mp_d` of the `Integer` that happens to hold the field's order.

The result is that the `order` is then set to `1` as well.  This happens *after* the check that `order>1` so creation of the field still succeeds.  Clearly there is a subtle bug either in `fast_tp_new`, or in the memory allocator itself.

Yep, I agree. Though I think there's also a possibility of a subtle bug.  The code around which this is happening looks like this:

```python
            order = Integer(order)
            if order <= 1:
                raise ValueError("the order of a finite field must be at least 2")

            if order.is_prime():
                p = order
                n = Integer(1)
```

It's the last line, `n = Integer(1)` where that `Integer` has the same `_mp_d` as `order` for some reason.  Also in this case `order` is already passed in as an `Integer`, so I'm wondering if there's some subtle bug around `order = Integer(order)`.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Two new notes:

1. I can reproduce the problem reliably on Cygwin by the following:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(5), [4,0])
sage: set_random_seed(0); P = E.random_element()
sage: alarm(0.5); (2^(10^7)) * P

----> 1 alarm(RealNumber('0.5')); (Integer(2)**(Integer(10)**Integer(7))) * P
...
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/integer.pyx in sage.rings.integer.Integer._shift_helper (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:40438)()
   6371         # Now finally call into MPIR to do the shifting.
   6372         cdef Integer z = PY_NEW(Integer)
-> 6373         sig_on()
   6374         if n < 0:
   6375             mpz_fdiv_q_2exp(z.value, self.value, -n)

src/cysignals/signals.pyx in cysignals.signals.sig_raise_exception()

AlarmInterrupt:
sage: a = Integer(5)
sage: a
5
sage: b = Integer(1)
sage: a
1
```
 This same process works correctly on Linux though, which is still suspicious.

2. If I remove the following lines from `fast_tp_dealloc` the problem appears to go away:

```python
        # Here we free any extra memory used by the mpz_t by
        # setting it to a single limb.
        if o_mpz._mp_alloc > 10:
            _mpz_realloc(o_mpz, 1)
```
 so it's possible also something fishy is happening with `_mpz_realloc`.

On occasion it's elsewhere, but most of the time it's in that shift call.  To learn much else I'll have to drop into gdb, but first I'll have to rebuild some modules with `-O(>0)` and see if the problem returns...

Right, but doesn't that at least mean it's at least somewhere between that `sig_on()` and the corresponding `sig_off()`?

<a id='comment:27'></a>It looks like it's being interrupted in the `_mpz_realloc` call from `mpz_mul_2exp(z.value, self.value, n)`, on the just-created `Integer` "z".

I *think* I see the general problem here.  The function `_mpz_realloc` is not interrupt-safe.  Even with GMP's realloc set to `sig_realloc`, that just blocks signals before/after the actual `realloc`.  However, it's then only after `realloc` succeeds that the `_mp_d` pointer gets updated.  If the signal handler is invoked before that happens then the old value in `_mp_d` might now point to a freed address (in fact, and address to a size=1 array of limbs).

Then, as `fast_mul` is cleaned up it again frees an integer (the variable "n").  This is a large integer so it trips the semi-arbitrary condition:

```python
        # Here we free any extra memory used by the mpz_t by
        # setting it to a single limb.
        if o_mpz._mp_alloc > 10:
            _mpz_realloc(o_mpz, 1)
```

and this `realloc` happens to give back the same `size=1` array that was previously just freed.  So both `_mp_d` end up with the same pointer.

1. Whenever `cysignals` raises an exception, it stores a pointer `cysigs.exc_value` to the exception.

2. `Integer.tp_dealloc` checks whether the exception saved by cysignals equals the currently pending exception. If not, it resets `cysigs.exc_value = NULL`. If the exception matches, it assumes that the `Integer` is in a broken state and it skips `tp_dealloc` completely: it does not store in the pool and it does not call `mpz_clear` on it.

Many interesting `mpz` functions take time at least linear in the size of the input. Since we want to support large integers, they can all take a long time.

Perhaps the only obvious example to apply `sig_block()`/`sig_unblock()` to would be `mpz_init()`.
