The following code

```
set_random_seed(2)
L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ, 2)
U = L.universal_enveloping_algebra()
PBW = L.pbw_basis()
E, F, H = PBW.algebra_generators()
Q = QuadraticForm(QQ, 2, [1,0,1])
C = CliffordAlgebra(Q)
e, f = C.algebra_generators()
UC = PBW.tensor(C)
x = UC.algebra_generators()[(E, e)]
UC.algebra_generators()[E*F - F*E, (1, 1)]
```
usually works but sometimes fires AttributeError exception. Or sometimes it runs fine, but when you try the tensor product with the algebras swapped it throws the exception. E.g. 

```
CU = C.tensor(PBW)
```
produced

Well, at least that was the situation yesterday. Today it seems that PBW.tensor(C) always works and C.tensor(PBW) always doesn't. No... wait a minute. Nope. Now both tensor products work. So it is still nondeterministic. :-(

Confirmed with

```
L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ, 2)
U = L.universal_enveloping_algebra()
PBW = L.pbw_basis()
E, F, H = PBW.algebra_generators()
Q = QuadraticForm(QQ, 2, [1,0,1])
C = CliffordAlgebra(Q)
e, f = C.algebra_generators()
UC = PBW.tensor(C)
C.tensor(PBW)
```

HOWEVER, I'm not sure if this is a bug! `C` is a superalgebra whereas `PBW` is an algebra. Per se, I wouldn't expect Sage to know how to tensor them. I suspect we need to teach it. Or maybe even create a functorial construction that turns a superalgebra into an algebra and vice versa?

FTR, I have confirmed this as well.

No, the category framework should be able to work this out as a superalgebra is an algebra under the forgetful functor (i.e., `Algebras(QQ)` appears in `all_super_categories()` of `Algebras(QQ).Super()`). It definitely should not result in the error above. It is also very strange that it is a heisenbug.

A superalgebra is an algebra, but an algebra is also a superalgebra. So there is a tensor product in either category. And they're different! The one in Algebras has forgotten the super-structure from the super-tensorand. How do we decide which to use?

IIRC, Sage takes the safest route by taking the meet category, which in this case should be `Algebras(QQ)` since we essentially say an algebra is not a superalgebra (in the same way we do not say a ring is a ZZ-algebra).
