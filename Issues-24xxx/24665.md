The rational torsion order is a term in the BSD conjecture. I think it deserves to be slightly more easily callable. This ticket will make the following the same.


```
sage: J = J0(11)
sage: J.rational_torsion_subgroup().order()
5
```

```
sage: J = J0(11)
sage: J.rational_torsion_order()
5
```


Keywords: rational torsion order modular abelian variety
