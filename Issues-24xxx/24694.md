`configure.ac` makes sure not to install GCC when the GCC Sage package is already installed.

The same should be done for gfortran: it should not be installed when the GCC Sage package is already installed. There is a check that gfortran is not installed if we need to install GCC. But there is no such check if GCC was already installed earlier.

In the `configure.ac` script, this can be tested by `test x$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = xexists`
