This removes the `$PIP_INSTALL` environment variable in favor of a new `sdh_pip_install` helper function in `sage-dist-helpers`.  This is consistent with the purpose of the library of build helper functions, and is hopefully the last time such a mass change should be made.

(I realize in [#21441 comment:36](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21441#comment:36) I argued against making more mass updates to replace `PIP_INSTALL`, but I'm not wild about the environment variable either, and now that the helper functions exist this seems like the best approach for consistency's sake.)

The only change this makes to the `spkg-install` scripts is a bulk `sed`.

Oh I see what you're saying now--keep `PIP_INSTALL` for now and still use it in brial and dot2tex.  Not exactly a happy thing but it makes sense.

The question is: Should I open a separate ticket for later removal of `PIP_INSTALL` entirely?  I think yes...

In `appnope`, you removed the error check:

```diff
-    $PIP_INSTALL . || exit $?
+    sdh_pip_install .
```

Given that you did not add such a check to `sdh_pip_install` (it would make sense to do that though), this is wrong.

Hmm, yes--`sage-pip-install` already has reasonable error messages, but in the context of the `spkg-install` script we still need to handle errors in it.  Notably, `appnope` was the only package that had this error check at all (but in most cases it's the only command run so I guess it wasn't necessary).
