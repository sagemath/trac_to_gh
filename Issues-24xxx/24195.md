In Sage, finite fields automatically form a lattice of subfields of an algebraic closure except those constructed with explicit generator names. However, the following is counter-intuitive.

```
sage: k=GF(4)
sage: K=k.extension(3, name='a')
sage: k.is_subring(K)
False
sage: L=k.extension(3)
sage: k.is_subring(L)
True
```

This is because K is explicitly constructed as an extension of the finite field k, thus it is expected that k is regarded as a subfield of K. That is, there should be a coercion map of k into K.

A little bit further in the code you can see

```
        # Use the canonical map if it exists.
        f = E.coerce_map_from(self)
        if f is None:
            from sage.categories.homset import Hom
            f = Hom(self, E).an_element()
        return (E, f)
```
It would make more sense to factor it with what you have done.

Moreover, with your changes I believe that the conditional statement above is not used anymore.

How is it possible? As far as I know, trying to know if there is an embedding closes the possibility to add new coercion map...

> This is very hackish condition `not (hasattr(E, '_prefix') and hasattr(self, '_prefix'))`. What are you exactly testing with it?


You can find similar condition in other parts of the file. So it is "standard" in the file. The condition is to test whether the finite field is part of the lattice of subfields of an algebraic closure. Thus if the condition is true, an automatic coercion is provided by the ecosystem of finite fields, and so there is no need to provide one intentionally.

Ah, I misunderstood your suggestion! Ok. That is possible :-)

I didn't know that `f = Hom(self, E).an_element()` does (almost) the same thing with my code using `roots`.

Anyway the `an_element()` method does a few additional condition checkings, which are redundant for our case. But these additional checkings would take negligible time, perhaps a few micro seconds.

The `an_element()` method eventually resolves to `any_root()` method for the modulus polynomial. Comparing `any_root()` and `roots()`, I got these interesting timings:

```
sage: F=GF(16)
sage: E=F.extension(2)
sage: timeit('f.any_root(E,assume_squarefree=True)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.85 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f.roots(E)[0][0]')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.77 ms per loop
sage: F=GF(16)
sage: E=F.extension(2)
sage: f=F.modulus()
sage: timeit('f.roots(E)[0][0]')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.78 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f.any_root(E,assume_squarefree=True)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.87 ms per loop
sage: F=GF(81)
sage: E=F.extension(3)
sage: f=F.modulus()
sage: timeit('f.any_root(E,assume_squarefree=True)')
125 loops, best of 3: 7.46 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f.roots(E)[0][0]')
125 loops, best of 3: 7.42 ms per loop
sage: E=F.extension(5)
sage: f=F.modulus()
sage: timeit('f.any_root(E,assume_squarefree=True)')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.17 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f.roots(E)[0][0]')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.13 ms per loop
```

This seems to indicate that finding all roots actually takes less time than finding any one root! 

My conclusion is that it is slightly better to construct the homomorphism directly using either `roots()` or `any_root()` as in my code than to use `Hom(self, E).an_element()`.  But I don't have any preference either to `roots()` or `any_root()`.
