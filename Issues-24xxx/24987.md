It seems that not all `.pxd` files are installed:

```
$ ls -l local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/mpfr/
ls: cannot access local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/mpfr/: No such file or directory
```

The reasons seems to be that `sage.libs.mpfr` is not a Python package (in the sense that `import sage.libs.mpfr` does not work). The function `find_extra_files` in `src/sage_setup/find.py` only searches for Cython files within Python packages.
