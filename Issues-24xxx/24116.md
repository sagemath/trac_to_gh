Can you explain a little bit why you need to explicitly add an `_add_` and `_mul_` methods to `FiniteRingElement`? It seems like it is not (suppose to be) a concrete class and we do not do similar declarations in our other abstract subclasses of `Element`. I'm just trying to understand what is different here.
