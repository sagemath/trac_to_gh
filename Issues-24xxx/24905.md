```

sage -t backend_polymake.py  # 53 doctests failed

The first is:

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)], rays=[(1,1)],lines=[], backend='polymake')
```

for which I get:

```

Another type of error seems to be that not putting `()` at the end of a CAPITALIZEDPOLYMAKEMETHOD returns a function and not the result anymore.

It seems that the commit 791f766 merged the develop branch into the upgrade polymake branch?

We then get all the diffs from the develop branch on this ticket... I would revert back to a previous commit if no changes were done at the same time as this merge... Let's see how it goes with this update on top of the last beta.

Now version 3.2.r4 is out as well and I updated the description of the ticket.

Polymake days are January 24-26 2019, I will ask them if a stable release is to be expected soon...

    sage: polymake("'ok'")                              # optional - polymake
    'ok'
```

   So we need to handle this differently when calling member functions.

- I get a compilation error directly while asking for the Type of a polytope:

```
polytope > $c = cube(3);
polytope > $t = typeof $c;
polymake:  ERROR: Compilation error
```

This breaks pretty much everything, as the object is not able to catch its type and get the proper names for functions, and lots of other things...

The previous commits fix the polymake interface, see https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1675 for a discussion of the issue.

In short, the command

```
$t = typeof $c;
```

Stopped working (as in the tutorials mentionned in the discussion) and we should use:

```
$t = $c -> type;
```

This seems to have fixed the problems.

There is still a spurious failing test in the interface which is an appearing blankline. I ignore it for now...

Next, I'll check the polymake backend for polyhedron. There seems to be around 4 failing doctests. That's much better than the 100s... there was.

On the release page of polymake 3.2 https://polymake.org/doku.php/news/release_3_2

one can read under "polytope":

- zero vectors in input properties throw an exception

This breaks a few of our tests.

I had polymake installed via `./sage -i polymake` before.
This didn't require any extra installations.

I went through the instructions of this ticket and ignored
`./sage -info polymake`.
This failed. Following the instructions and executing

```
cpan -i XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp
```
beforehand worked fine.

To me it looks like `./sage -i polymake` worked somehow out of the box before and now it doesn't anymore.

Btw, also polymake is not auto-detected when running doctests.

So `./sage -t --all --long` will not use polymake unless specified.

I don't know, if this is a problem specific to my installation or not.

Have a look at the commit to see what changed. When we update a package, we change the source and the place to download the package. Since the package is not yet on the sage mirror, this is why you download it and put it in the appropriate folder by hand.

After doing so, as long as you are on this branch, installing polymake will install the newest version (the one written with this new ticket). If you go back to a different ticket, you have to (re-)install polymake the usual way. And it should work. But well, polymake installation used to not work before, so there's no discussion to have on this aspect. We should focus on the present installation.

Again, can you state clearly what you did step-by-step and say if each step worked or not. It is difficult to follow from what you write about what worked and what did not work.

Polymake is an experimental package, so it is not included in the default testing. Perhaps there is a way to include all experimental package. But this is a recipe for disaster anyway. So just add it by hand each time you test. That's the cheapest solution.

Okay, this is annoying, as I do not get this error in my case. It seems that they randomly throw out such transparency statements about libraries it uses. Okay. Thanks for pointing this out.

Ok, let's try again.

In my current Sage installation I had polymake 3.1 installed. When installing it, this worked out of the box. So a simply run of `./sage -i polymake` and I had polymake 3.3. No prereqs.

When testing this ticket, I checked out this branch and pulled and did everything as instructed, but ignored
`./sage -info polymake`. This did not work (yes I didn't follow the instructions completely).

When I paid attention to `./sage -info polymake` and installed the perl thing, it worked fine.

If somehow possible, it would be nice to have `./sage -i polymake` work without any prereqs again.
But I have no idea whats going on and whether this depends on my specific computer or not.

I just wanted to point out, that the update to polymake 3.2 has a prequirement that wasn't there before. You are probably aware of this, I just wanted to mention it.

Just to mention this.

I am using cofio: https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/?machine=debian&machine=9.6&machine=x86_64&machine=4.9.0-8-amd64&machine=cofio&status=open

Not with the Sage same install, but I don't think it matters.

Okay, thanks for the clarification. I do not know if there is a way to fix this through the installation of polymake. Since there is no section Debian in the installation instruction coming from  `sage -info polymake` which one did you execute? The ubuntu ones? None?

```
./sage -info polymake

...

A distribution-independent way to install Perl modules (into a user's
home directory) is using CPAN.

 cpan -i XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp
```

This did the job. I also did 
`sage -i 4ti2 latte_int topcom qhull` then, but this has most likely nothing to do with the issue.

Upstream say this is fixed in Polymake 3.4, released 2019-04-15.

Should we upgrade to Polymake 3.4 instead of 3.2 in this ticket?

+1. It makes no sense to upgrade to 3.2 before 3.4.

Although the version 3.3 did not compile on debian stretch and this is why I thought that having 3.2rc4 working could have fixed the backend quickly. Since I do not know how long it will take to make the version 3.4 work, I thought it is better to do things one step at a time.\n\nThe whole interface was broken and at least now it works on debian and they proposed a fix.\n\nAnyhow, yes, we can just skip to 3.4, let's just hope it is not a quantum leap...",

Agreed. Although the version 3.3 did not compile on debian stretch and this is why I thought that having 3.2rc4 working could have fixed the backend quickly. Since I do not know how long it will take to make the version 3.4 work, I thought it is better to do things one step at a time.

The whole interface was broken and at least now it works on debian and they proposed a fix.

Anyhow, yes, we can just skip to 3.4, let's just hope it is not a quantum leap...

Is there a way to control/predict this kind of behavior? It would be annoying to have such errors in the doctests.

Since it is an experimental package, this could be tolerable, but it would be good to grasp how this occurs...

I will this new branch.

It seems that almost nothing works anymore. I have no idea what I can do about it besides deleting everything and reinstalling sage.

Those errors are happening in the develop branch as well.

By the way, nothing works in src/sage/interfaces/polymake.py. This is the start of a very long list.

Thanks for checking. In these three doctests it looks like polymake is emitting some extra newlines.
This is probably some nondeterministic pty interaction.

I set up my sage again and everything worked (all tests passed).

After installing polymake (and normaliz pynormaliz 4ti2 latte_int topcom qhull)
I am getting the following failure:

This looks familiar and indeed I have had this issue before:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/wqnilUCLsT4

The last time I had this issue this also happened in connection with this ticket on a different machine.

There are several more failures in this file, but I believe they are all due to the same issue.

I do not think that this error is related to this ticket as we are not touching the file `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx` directly, nor does the installation (as far as I can see) is related to this module. This looks like a local error on this machine.

Considering that:

- that the package is experimental,
- it compiles on macOS Mojave, debian, and ArchLinux,

I would set this ticket to positive review. Further issues can be reported here: #22710.

I have this error occuring on two different machines and it's installation dependent (on one machine it only shows up in one installation). As it hasn't been there in this installation before installing normaliz pynormaliz 4ti2 latte_int topcom qhull polymake, I suppose that one of them for some strange reason causes `alarm` to not work correctly anymore (this causes the memory overflow as the list of divisors is too long for `./sage -t` default).

It is possible that a patchbot cannot have polymake installed. But I'm not certain of this yet.

The failure has nothing to do with this ticket.

I updated my post on sage-devel.

It seems that many patchbots fail that test in the sense that alarm interrupt takes way too long (they all take about a minute for this file and this seems to be the reason why).
In my case the machine allocates the list for the divisors already, which exceeds the default allowance for `.sage -t`.

Let's get this done and open another ticket for promotion to optional.

When MongoDB is not available, the function `db_query` is not even present.
Not sure if/why we want to doctest that.

Let's postpone doctesting the `db_query` function in Sage to #27802, which adds support for the dictionary that appears in the argument list.
