Don't you think that we can remove checks like `[ -f Makefile ]`? They seem like superfluous sanity checks.

Would it make sense to just incorporate this directly into #25567?  Otherwise, I'm fine to just rebase on top of that.  I'm happy to remove superfluous sanity checks.  In the past I feel like I've been discouraged from doing so because "it was there for a reason" but I don't remember if that was you or someone else.  Maybe it was just one case where it really was there for a reason...
