On Python 2 something like this works:

```
Sequence([range(10)])
```

naturally, since `range(10)` just returns a `list`.  On Python 3 however, since `range` is a type:

```
sage: Sequence([range(10)])
Traceback
...
TypeError: 'range' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
...
TypeError: unable to convert range(0, 10) to an element of <class 'range'>
```

This is because the `Sequence` constructor determines the "universe" of the sequence to be `range`, and later tries to pass `range` objects to `range` like: `universe(x[i])` where `x[i]` is the `range(10)` instance.

It assumes that whatever `universe` is can construct an instance of itself by being passed a single argument.  One could argue that Python's `range()` built-in should support this as a special case.  But regardless this should be fixed in Sage. I'm just not sure the best way yet.
