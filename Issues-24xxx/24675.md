```
Some paths in R binaries still point to the build directory, for example, in the file `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/R/bin/R` we can see `R_HOME_DIR="/opt/sagemath/sage-source/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.4.3/src` which corresponds to the build dir (hence does not exist anymore once R is installed).

This causes issues, for example if we ask rstudio to use Sage's R. See [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/rpTr7boUQbA/SRkFb7IbCAAJ).

This could be some legacy of the patch "hardcoded_dirs.patch". We may be able to do better than that.
