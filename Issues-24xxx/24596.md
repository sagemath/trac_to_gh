We have access to SPARC T4 system

```
SunOS xenos-sagetest 5.11 11.3 sun4v sparc sun4v
```

We track here the resulting issues and tickets.

* no need to pre-build any tools, apparently. Everything is available via Solaris `pkg` or `pkgutil` (i.e. opencsw). 

* MPFR configure fails with MPIR. Can be resolved by using GMP instead. Upstream: [issue 242](https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/issues/242). For details and a possible fix, see #24674.

* Various packages need `CFLAGS="-D_XPG6"`

* To take care of the above, set the following before building

```
export PATH=/opt/csw/gnu:$PATH
export CFLAGS="-O2 -g -D_XPG6"
export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"        # Maybe not strictly needed

./configure --with-mp=gmp
```

* OpenBLAS fails to auto-detect SPARC CPU: #24638

* #24597 fixes building issues for python2/3

* building `fplll` and `singular` fails due to a silly C++  (g++ 5.4.0)
  error, which cannot properly compile templated `pow()` from 
  `cmath`, e.g. the following fails:

```
#include <cmath>
int main()
{
int i,j,k;
i = 2;
j = 10;
k = pow(i,j);
return k;
}
```
   This appears to be platform-specific.  Same error with g++ 7.2.0. Adding `std::` to pow, or adding `using namespace std;` results in successful compilation of this example (and most probably this also will work for Singular).
** this problem went away by itself after some changes to the linker used, I don't really know why **

* iconv fails due to a wrong assumption on the standard in the 
  source code, fixed in the latest stable version. #24602 is the 
  update to do here.

* gcc 7.2 builds fplll, whereas gcc 5.4 cannot do it. See #24618

* linking of Singular is tentatively fixed by #24611

<a id='comment:10'></a>One more issue is just reported here: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/816

Singular uses specific -Wl linker syntax in libpolys/polys/Makefile.am
which nukes linking (as Solaris linker does not accept `dynamic_lookup` parameter).
(By right, it's autotools that should generate such platform-specific arguments, it's asking for trouble to give them explicitly).

Feel free to open as many tickets as needed- making sure that we don't duplicate each other.

trying to build R with system's pcre (remove the dependence on pcre from R, and remove pcre stuff from SAGEROOT/local/[bin,lib])
gets me past this ugly segfault.

Stuck later in some linking error, which should be manageable
(need to rebuild with -j1 for a meaningful log).

I managed it with the system GMP, MPFR, and MPC, which have non-standard header locations (thus lots of these flags). Also, `--build=` is needed. This is what I did to build
gcc 7.2 in /datapool/dima/bin

```
./configure --prefix=/datapool/dima --with-gmp-include=/usr/include/gmp --with-mpfr-include=/usr/include/mpfr --with-mpc=/usr --without-gnu-ld --with-ld=/usr/bin/ld --with-gnu-as --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran  --enable-shared --enable-initfini-array  --with-system-zlib  --with-as=/usr/gnu/bin/as --build=sparcv9-sun-solaris2.11
```
You need to make sure that Solaris `ld` is 1st in the PATH (I have a dedicated directory `/datapool/dima/tools` with a link to /usr/bin/ld which is 1st in my PATH), and also I used the same
flags as for building Sage:

```
CFLAGS=-D_XPG6
PATH=/datapool/dima/tools:/opt/csw/gnu:/opt/csw/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
```
Probably if I tried harder it would also have worked with Sage's gcc - we don't set `--build=`, do we?

To use gfortran built there one needs 

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/datapool/dima/lib/sparcv9
```
(perhaps there is a better way)

So, it's a GCC build *outside* of Sage. I was simply trying to build with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`.

So no `-m64` to build GCC?

This did not work for me either, I merely wanted to see whether it's an internal Sage issue, or a bigger problem. (So yes, it's a Sage internal issue, not sure we must fix it no matter what; after all, the system's gcc 5.4.0 appears to be doing the job just as well.)

I did `export ABI=64`. I ended up with 64-bit results. It might be managed by `--build`, perhaps. However, I suppose one ends up with tools capable of building 64- and 32-bit programs. In $PREFIX/lib/ it has installed a bunch of 32-bit ELFs, and in

I don't know why `sage/combinat/partitions` needs to redefine `isinf(double)` - it is something about C++ vs plain C?

I believe that with recent [openCSW](https://www.opencsw.org/manual/for-administrators/getting-started.html) you basically get the same tools for Solaris 11 and 10, 
so it should not matter too much whether it's 10 or 11. (YMMV, naturally).

One can get gcc 5.4 and all the g-stuff (gtar, gawk, etc), so nothing needs to be built manually.
Give it a try once we have this ticket in a reasonable shape.

At the moment I get working Sage (with all this slew of tickets we opened here, and patches there), but building some bits of documentation (3d plots built with tachyon) fails.
