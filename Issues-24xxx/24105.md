Deprecate

1. Cython preprocessor pragmas like `#clib flint`. Instead, you can use the Cython declarations like `# distutils: libraries = flint`.

2. Various functions in `sage.misc.cython` to implement this. Keep them as private underscored functions.

3. The module `sage.misc.cython_c` which currently only contains a wrapper around `cython_import_all()`.
