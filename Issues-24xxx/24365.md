In #22079 `floor/ceil` gets a new implementation. Symbolic arguments are not checked with `is_integer` however so we get

```
sage: var('x',domain='integer')
x
sage: floor(x)
floor(x)
sage: ceil(x)
ceil(x)
```
Inserting that check (if not is_numeric) would immediately simplify a class of expressions.
