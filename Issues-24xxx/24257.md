I explained this more in the commit message, but in short I realized that I don't like how the doctest output checker applies `remove_unicode_u`.  It was applying it the "actual output" strings on both Python 2 and Python 3.  Really what we want is to leave the output strings alone on Python 2, since an unexpected unicode string in the output could represent a test failure.  Likewise it doesn't make sense to apply on Python 3 since we should never see u-prefixed strings in the actual output on Python 3.

Instead, we just want to strip u-prefixed strings from the desired output, and on Python 3 only, so that tests that expect some `str.__repr__()` pass the same on both Python 2 and 3.  Python 2 tests that *explicitly* expect unicode will also pass on Python 3 since Python 3 `str``s are already unicode.

For tests that should expect bytes we can use the `b*` prefix and similarly strip `b*` prefixes from the desired output on Python 2, but I haven't actually hit too many cases like that yet so I will address that separately.

I pushed some changes to fix the tests that were broken by this change, though perhaps these changes should be moved to a separate ticket if anyone cares (I don't really).

Basically I removed `from `__future__` import unicode_literals` from a few modules, as this tends to actually cause more trouble than it's worth (there's often this temptation when first starting a port of a large project to Python 3 to start using `unicode` everywhere even on Python 2, but this actually ends up breaking a lot of things for Python 2 with minimal benefit to the Python 3 port; so really it's best to use `unicode` in Python 3 only in narrow cases where it makes sense to).

I then restored `u''` literals to some of the expected test outputs.  Again, particularly in the doctest module where it makes sense to find unicode strings, since we are treating test inputs and outputs as unicode.

For the record: the `unicode_literals` in `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py` is totally intentional. It is the right thing to do since `ipywidgets` (like most of Jupyter) uses mostly `unicode` internally.
