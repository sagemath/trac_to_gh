Remove code deprecated in #21024, #20835, #21165, #20565, #20953, #20908, #20787, #20100, #18928, #21576, #19930.

Note that this removes numerous functions from the top-level namespace and other unwanted places.

While removing the deprecated `sage.coding.code_constructions.ReedSolomonCode` it became clear that a rethinking of what `ReedSolomonCode` should do: a new version which constructs "classical Reed-Solomon codes" has therefore been implemented in `sage.coding.grs`.

**According to the deprecation policy, this can be merged 25 March 2018**

Reed-Solomon codes are of course part of Generalized Reed-Solomon codes. But I would expect to find distinct `ReedSolomonCode` under `codes`...

Good catch! I agree that typing `codes.ReedSo<tab>` should definitely complete to something :-) I see 3 options:

1. `ReedSolomonCode` should just be an alias of `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`.

2. Rename `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode` to `ReedSolomonCode` (with of course a deprecation period for `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`. 

3. `ReedSolomonCode` should only construct classical" Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. where the evaluation points are chosen as `x_i = alpha^i` for `i = 0,...,n-1` and `n | (q-1)`. These are cyclic codes and have in a few other respects nicer properties than choosing arbitrary evaluation points. If we choose this, we need to find a good signature for the function, which is not too confusing wrt. the signature of `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`. E.g. `ReedSolomonCode(n, k, root_of_unity=None)` or something.

I'm torn between option 2. and 3. What do you think?

Best,
Johan

I prefer 3. For the proper signature, I like your suggestion. But I remind you that in `BCHCode`, the name `primitive_root` is used in the place of`root_of_unity`. I don't know which name is prevalent in sage...

Removing it can leave new users thinking that RS codes are not in Sage, until that future ticket would be written. Putting a base implementation in here removes that gap. Plus, now I've already written it :-)


I agree.

Ok, then. I agree that the current implementation is good enough. On the other hand, I am not sure if I care about the subclass-based implementation. 

Let's wait for the patchbots then.
