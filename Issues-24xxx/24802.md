That's what we expect:

```
sage: berlekamp_massey([1,2,4,8])
x - 2
```

My students got surprised by this though:

```
sage: berlekamp_massey([1,2,4,9])
x - 2
sage: berlekamp_massey([2,2,4,8])
x - 2
```

The point is that `berlekamp_massey` on a list of 2n elements searches for a linear recurrence of length less than `n`, while `1,2,4,9` satisfies no such recurrence. The current documentation does not specify the behavior in this case.

Two options:
- Either the obtained relation should be checked against the full sequence, and an error be returned if the relation is not valid
- Or the documentation should spell explicitly that the result is only guaranteed to be correct on the full sequence if there exist a linear recurrence of length less than `n`

I'd also like to see some improvement in this function.  The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, as described in Massey's paper, determines an annihilating polynomial (well, actually, the reciprocal of this polynomial) of smallest possible degree for the given sequence.  Such a polynomial is unique if that degree is at most half the length of the input, but the polynomial exists in all cases.

So I'd add a third option: implement the actual algorithm as originally published (but computing the annihilating polynomial rather than the "connection" polynomial in the original), and document the output more carefully.

I'm not a big fan of the second option above; I'd rather see first option, raising an error, than silently accepting parameters not satisfying the algorithm's assumptions---if we stick with the existing implementation.
