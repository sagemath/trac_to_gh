While other orthogonal polynomial functions (as well as almost all other symbolic functions) are simply `BuiltinFunction`s or `GinacFunction`s this ticket suffers from the fact that the Cheby functions in Sage allow the `algorithm` keyword (by using a `__call__` method in the superclass). The way such polymorphisms are resolved in other functions is by having the interface (the callable global function `chebyshev_T()`) dispatching on the keyword, especially because doctests involving all kind of Sage objects as function argument are expected to work eternally.

The goal of this ticket is to move the `__call__` method out of the `Function` class (as well as other methods used as interface) into a separate interface class; to 2. make the remaining class inherit from `BuiltinFunction` and, 3., to remove the `ChebyshevFunction` superclass as it is then no longer used.

Also the usage `chebyshev_T(...algorithm='maxima')` used normal evaluation. Maxima returns a polynomial in `(x-1)` which probably is useful so I'm changing doctests. In a later step this could be renamed to a more descriptive name and computed by Sage.
