```
Although the order of indices is not necessarily meaningful, it often makes for nicer, more human-meaningful output to sort them.  For example:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().Filtered().example()
sage: grA = A.graded_algebra()
sage: grA.algebra_generators()
Finite family {'x': bar(U['x']), 'y': bar(U['y']), 'z': bar(U['z'])
```

instead of the more seemingly arbitrary

```
Finite family {'y': bar(U['y']), 'x': bar(U['x']), 'z': bar(U['z'])
```

which of course is itself a result that is not in any way guaranteed.

In addition to being more user-friendly, this change will also help a lot with tests that otherwise fail on Python 3 due to arbitrary differences in dict key ordering.

I had meant to respond to this earlier, but it fell off my radar.

I think that `FiniteFamily` should print out following `self._keys` if that is not `None` (which also dictates iteration order) and then fallback to the sorted output (see the `values` method).

True--I didn't see any cases in the tests where that was a problem but that could certainly happen I guess. On Python 3 `pprint` uses a "safe key" wrapper for the keys which falls back to Python 2-style ordering for unorderable types.  

I mentioned in my commit message that we might want to add something like this to Sage--I've definitely been finding other places in Sage where one would like to at least order things as best possible.  Maybe I'll go ahead and do that first...
