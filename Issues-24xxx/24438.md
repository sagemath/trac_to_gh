```
Although the order of indices is not necessarily meaningful, it often makes for nicer, more human-meaningful output to sort them.  For example:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().Filtered().example()
sage: grA = A.graded_algebra()
sage: grA.algebra_generators()
Finite family {'x': bar(U['x']), 'y': bar(U['y']), 'z': bar(U['z'])
```

instead of the more seemingly arbitrary

```
Finite family {'y': bar(U['y']), 'x': bar(U['x']), 'z': bar(U['z'])
```

which of course is itself a result that is not in any way guaranteed.

In addition to being more user-friendly, this change will also help a lot with tests that otherwise fail on Python 3 due to arbitrary differences in dict key ordering.
