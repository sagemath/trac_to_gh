`graphs.Balaban10Cage().is_cactus()` raises an exception.

Found by first making a list

```
G_all = []
for x in dir(graphs):
    if x == 'EmptyGraph':
        continue
    try:
        G = getattr(graphs, x)()
        _ = G.order()
        G_all.append(G)
        print G
    except:
        continue
```

and then just `sum(1 for g in G_all if g.is_cactus())` or something similar.

You are right.

This patch should correct it. Untested, now compiling on a slow machine.
