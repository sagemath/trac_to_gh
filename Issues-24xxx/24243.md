the following was reported to me by Eric Wegrzynowski (with Sage 8.0):

```
sage: from sympy import rsolve
sage: from sympy import Function
sage: from sympy.abc import n
sage: u = Function('u')
sage: f = u(n+1) - (u(n) + (n+1)^2)
sage: rsolve(f, u(n),{u(0):0})
C1*n*(n**2 + 2*n + 1)
```
this answer is wrong, it should be `1/6*(2*n + 1)*(n + 1)*n` and not contain any unknown constant.

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. No feedback yet.

reported upstream at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13629,
and set back the milestone to 8.1, since this is also a bug in Sage
(which could well use another package than SymPy to solve recurrence relations).
