```
In the old Sage notebook, a `selector()` widget with buttons could be used as "action" button: with each press of the button, the interact would be run. This is obviously only useful for non-deterministic interacts (where the output can change even if the widgets do not).

Example:

```
import datetime

@interact
def f(action=selector(["one", "two", "three"], buttons=True)):
    print(action)
    print(datetime.datetime.now())
```

This should be enabled in the Jupyter notebook using https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pull/1259

Depends on #23177
