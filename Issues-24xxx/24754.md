```
+                            [Expression], eval_methods, prepend_cls_bases=False)

while using a list for the bases certainly works, it's just kind of unidomatic, as opposed to using a tuple (since internally it's stored as a tuple).  But for the purposes of the constructor it doesn't really matter...
