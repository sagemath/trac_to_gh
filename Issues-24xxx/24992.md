Symbolic comparison is wrongly used in several places throughout Sage (overview https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics/nonzero). The ticket replaces code involuntarily calling `__nonzero__` with a call of the `is_zero` or `is_equal` member functions to clarify if simplification is needed or not. The code positions calling `__nonzero__` were obtained by raising an exception in `__nonzero__` and analyzing the resulting doctest fails. Of course not every simplification is unwanted so every case must be considered and tested.

I get a 10-15% decrease of CPU time with this branch when doing `sage -tp src/sage/rings/asymptotic/` (from 31.5s to 26.5-28.5s).

It's not finished, there are more instances in Sage where the changes can be applied.
