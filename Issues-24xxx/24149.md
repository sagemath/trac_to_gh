```
currently we get with Sage 8.0:

```
sage: R.<x> = IntegerModRing(4)[]
sage: R(0).roots(multiplicities=False)
[0, 1, 2, 3]
```
but:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R(0).roots(ring=IntegerModRing(4),multiplicities=False)
...
ValueError: roots of 0 are not defined
```
The second answer is inconsistent with the first one, and in this case the roots are well defined: all elements of the finite ring are roots.

moreover the first way does not work properly for 2:

In the case of an infinite base ring, one can still return the base ring (thought as an infinite set). I would also prefer an `ArithmeticError` in every case.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A3):
> In the case of an infinite base ring, one can still return the base ring (thought as an infinite set). 

True, but the expectation is for a list.

> I would also prefer an `ArithmeticError` in every case.

Let's do that then. :-)

here is another example with Sage 8.8:

sage: R.<X> = IntegerModRing(1048576)[]
sage: p = 16*X^2 + 320*X + 576

The roots of that polynomial modulo 1048576 are well defined, we should get their list instead.
