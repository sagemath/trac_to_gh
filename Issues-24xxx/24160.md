Use the iterator that returns lists and check the dominance condition on that to avoid the (relatively) costly creation of a `Partition`.

This gives ~35% speedup:

```
sage: P = Partition([7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
sage: %timeit P.dominated_partitions()
10 loops, best of 3: 26.5 ms per loop
```
versus old

```
sage: P = Partition([7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
sage: %timeit P.dominated_partitions()
10 loops, best of 3: 37.3 ms per loop
```
