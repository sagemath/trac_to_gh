From a suggestion by dcoudert (ticket:24634#comment:10):
Let's move some of the methods that are actually only valid for undirected graphs from generic_graph to graph.

Methods to be moved:

a. `is_planar`
b. `is_drawn_free_of_edge_crossings`
c. ... (are there more?)

Things to be done:

1. Move method to new file 
2. add correct `@doc_index`
2. remove line from the doc in the beginning of the file `generic_graph`
2. Fix the references to methods in the `SEEALSO` section ...
2. ... also for other methods referencing the moved method
2. ... is there more?

Please help editing these two lists. 

**Tickets**

We should not move `is_planar` and `is_drawn_free_of_edge_crossings` but correct them

```
sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(3,3)
sage: G.is_planar()
True
sage: D = DiGraph(G)
sage: D.is_planar()
False
```
A directed graph can be planar.
