On #24596, we see (on SPARC Solaris 11)

```
ImportError: ld.so.1: python2.7: fatal: libflint.so.13: open failed: No such file or directory
```

Indeed, Flint fails to create `libflint.so.13`, it only creates
`libflint.so` (a link) and `libflint.so.13.*` (the real library).

**Upstream**: https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/347

This fixes FLINT at least on FreeBSD and Solaris.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**

The exact upstream commit does not apply, as it is few dozens commits later than our MPIR. So it needs rebasing. 
The difference between the rebased upstream commit and this patch is as follows:

```
+-   MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD)
++   MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD|SunOS)
```

So you may try removing this chunk, if you must...

In turn, the upstream commit is merging my pull request:
https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/347
which was addressing the same sort of issue on FreeBSD.
And indeed it was needed to go from `MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin)` to
`MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD)` in the very same place.

On FreeBSD ldconfig does not accept the option `-n`, it needs `-m` or something like this. 
That's why it's necessary to special-case FreeBSD.

 Indeed, Flint fails to create `libflint.so.13`, it only creates
 `libflint.so` (a link) and `libflint.so.13.*` (the real library).
-I have fixed this kind of error in Flint on FreeBSD, see
-https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/347
 
-Thus updating the corresponding `case` in `configure` to include `SunOS` might be enough.
+**Upstream**: https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/347

+This fixes FLINT at least on FreeBSD and Solaris.
