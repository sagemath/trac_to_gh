This is bad:

```
M = mandelbrot_interact
...adjust various attributes of M...
return M
```

The problem is that you are changing and returning a unique global object. Instead of having

```
@interact.widget
def mandelbrot_interact(...
```
it would be better to just define `mandelbrot_interact` as an ordinary function and call `interact.widget()` inside the `mandelbrot_plot` function. That way, you end up with non-unique widgets.

Can you explain the `<CSI-2K>` appearing in the doctests? I feel uncomfortable accepting that without knowing where it comes from.

I'm not so happy that the input to `mandelbrot_plot()` is now completely ignored when `interact=True` is given. I'll try to work on this.

I will rebase on #25074. That's not strictly needed, but it's good to test against the newest version of ipywidgets.
