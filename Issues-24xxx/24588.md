These fix a number of major crashes related to handling of Python `int`s on Python 3, especially in cases that were trying to cram them into C `long`s.

Several quick comments:

1. In Cython, don't use `six` unless you have a very good reason. Cython supports `long(x)` both on Python 2 and Python 3.

2. In `integer_mod.pyx` you write

```
elif (isinstance(value, int) and
      integer_check_long_py(value, &longval, &err) and not err):
```
And you sure that you need the `isinstance(value, int)` check? Part of the point of `integer_check_long_py` is that there is no need for explicit type checking.

3. In `rational.pyx`, do you really need `IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:`?

Yes, I think when I wrote that one bit I just forgot I was in a Cython module.

In Python 2 we need both `__long__` and `__int__`, but on Python 3 if you have both defined Cython will take `__int__` (really it should take `__long__`).  But it seems to be confused.

For `Integer`, we add a specific hacked `tp_new` slot. See `fast_tp_new` in `integer.pyx`. This bypasses the Cython-generated `tp_new`, so Cython might optimize `Integer.__new__(Integer)` wrongly. This is not the case for `Rational`.

I guess the difference is mathematical: a `Morphism` must be a morphism (this means in particular that it is defined everywhere). Coercions are required to be morphisms, conversions may be maps which are not morphisms.

But I don't know how this mathematical difference is relevant for the implementation.

The answer is right in both the title and "component" of the ticket: "py3:".

This is far from the only "wrong" or at least "bad" code I've encountered in Sage in the course of making Python 3 (some of it is downright atrocious).  The focus of this changeset is to merely fix the bugs on Python 3.

> `int(x)` doesn't overflow

I was imprecise. The problem isn't that `int(x)` itself will overflow.  The behavior you cite is due to how `float.__int__` is implemented.  Not all the `__int__` in Sage return `long` objects (for Python 2) where it should.  Maybe that should be fixed (I can't remember a specific example), but it's safer to ask explicitly for a long.

But `int(x)` is used in so many places in Sage and in Python. I feel like we should have noticed any bugs there...

I had already fixed those things...

I'm not sure why this change:

```
-        elif err == ERR_OVERFLOW:
+        elif isinstance(x, long):
```

Why a relatively slow `isinstance` when the whole point of `ERR_OVERFLOW` is that the value was already an int/long too big to fit in a C long?  At any rate, there's now an unused `cimport` of `ERR_OVERFLOW`...

> Why a relatively slow `isinstance`

First of all, it's not at all slow. This uses `PyLong_Check()` which has an optimized code path:

```C
#define PyLong_Check(op) \
        PyType_FastSubclass(Py_TYPE(op), Py_TPFLAGS_LONG_SUBCLASS)
```
This shouldn't take any measurable time.

The reason that I changed it is because I want to check the actual condition that I need: it must be an actual Python `long` since that is what `mpz_set_pylong` takes (without checking). It is really just an extra safety check.

I think by the time I pushed my fixes you changed it to your branch.

I see now, upon closer inspection, that `integer_check_long_py` does *not* set `err = ERR_TYPE` if it was not passed an int/long.  So indeed in that case this additional check would be needed.

To be honest, it was not easy to decide the API for `integer_check_long(_py)`. My idea was to look at various use cases and then maybe reconsider how the API should be done.

But that shouldn't affect the status of this ticket.

Then the only information that you have is that the object is an integer of some sort where you don't care about its value. To me, that sounds unlikely so I wonder where it came up.

It seems safer and more natural to set `err[0] = ERR_INDEX` whenever any exception in `__index__` occurs. In any case, setting `err[0] = 0` is pointless because `integer_check_long_py()` is now guaranteed to set `err[0]` to some value.

I just reverted that. If you agree, you can set positive review.
