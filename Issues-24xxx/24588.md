These fix a number of major crashes related to handling of Python `int`s on Python 3, especially in cases that were trying to cram them into C `long`s.

I think this uses `integer_check_long` more or less as intended, but Jeroen will probably want to make sure, as its author.

Several quick comments:

1. In Cython, don't use `six` unless you have a very good reason. Cython supports `long(x)` both on Python 2 and Python 3.

2. In `integer_mod.pyx` you write

```
elif (isinstance(value, int) and
      integer_check_long_py(value, &longval, &err) and not err):
```
And you sure that you need the `isinstance(value, int)` check? Part of the point of `integer_check_long_py` is that there is no need for explicit type checking.

3. In `rational.pyx`, do you really need `IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:`?

Yes, I think when I wrote that one bit I just forgot I was in a Cython module.

1. In `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx`, what does "nor can it be coerced to an int" in the error message mean? You're *only* checking for `int`/`long`, not for something that can be coerced to an int (whatever that would mean).

2. In `integer.pyx` and `rational.pyx`, you have

First of all, the check for `int` seems wrong since it will also pass the `int == long` type on Python 3. Second, the exception should be a `TypeError`. Since there was no check before, maybe you shouldn't add a check.

3. Don't use `PY_NEW(Rational)`. Just use `Rational.__new__(Rational)`.

4. `int_toRR` could be made more efficient by directly using an `mpz_t` instead of an `Integer`.

5. In `src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx`, I would replace

For `Integer`, we add a specific hacked `tp_new` slot. See `fast_tp_new` in `integer.pyx`. This bypasses the Cython-generated `tp_new`, so Cython might optimize `Integer.__new__(Integer)` wrongly. This is not the case for `Rational`.

Indeed--there's no need for the `Integer` there.

I guess the difference is mathematical: a `Morphism` must be a morphism (this means in particular that it is defined everywhere). Coercions are required to be morphisms, conversions may be maps which are not morphisms.

But I don't know how this mathematical difference is relevant for the implementation.

The answer is right in both the title and "component" of the ticket: "py3:".

This is far from the only "wrong" or at least "bad" code I've encountered in Sage in the course of making Python 3 (some of it is downright atrocious).  The focus of this changeset is to merely fix the bugs on Python 3.

> `int(x)` doesn't overflow

I was imprecise. The problem isn't that `int(x)` itself will overflow.  The behavior you cite is due to how `float.__int__` is implemented.  Not all the `__int__` in Sage return `long` objects (for Python 2) where it should.  Maybe that should be fixed (I can't remember a specific example), but it's safer to ask explicitly for a long.

In this case I could change it and see how things go.  You're right--my only justifications in this case are vague hand-waving. I don't think there's a specific issue it addresses.  Although I will say that the use of `int(x)` in many places *does* have bugs, and they just don't show up because that code normally involves smaller numbers.

I had already fixed those things...

I'm not sure why this change:

```
-        elif err == ERR_OVERFLOW:
+        elif isinstance(x, long):
```

Why a relatively slow `isinstance` when the whole point of `ERR_OVERFLOW` is that the value was already an int/long too big to fit in a C long?  At any rate, there's now an unused `cimport` of `ERR_OVERFLOW`...

First of all, it's not at all slow. This uses `PyLong_Check()` which has an optimized code path:

```C
#define PyLong_Check(op) \
        PyType_FastSubclass(Py_TYPE(op), Py_TPFLAGS_LONG_SUBCLASS)
```
This shouldn't take any measurable time.

The reason that I changed it is because I want to check the actual condition that I need: it must be an actual Python `long` since that is what `mpz_set_pylong` takes (without checking). It is really just an extra safety check.

Then the only information that you have is that the object is an integer of some sort where you don't care about its value. To me, that sounds unlikely so I wonder where it came up.

Perhaps you're right. I definitely remember times during development where I wanted this, but I think maybe it was only while testing things and ignoring the error value.  Unless a specific example comes up again I won't worry about it.

The other thing I would still change.  It doesn't make sense to have a superfluous `isinstance(..., long)` there.  A small fix to `integer_check_long_py` would make more sense.

I think it does make sense. It doesn't hurt and it's a safety net against calling `mpz_set_pylong` with a non-`long` which could potentially segfault Python.

I don't agree entirely with this change:

It seems safer and more natural to set `err[0] = ERR_INDEX` whenever any exception in `__index__` occurs. In any case, setting `err[0] = 0` is pointless because `integer_check_long_py()` is now guaranteed to set `err[0]` to some value.

I just reverted that. If you agree, you can set positive review.
