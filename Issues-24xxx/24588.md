I think this uses `integer_check_long` more or less as intended, but Jeroen will probably want to make sure, as its author.

Several quick comments:

1. In Cython, don't use `six` unless you have a very good reason. Cython supports `long(x)` both on Python 2 and Python 3.

2. In `integer_mod.pyx` you write

```
elif (isinstance(value, int) and
      integer_check_long_py(value, &longval, &err) and not err):
```
And you sure that you need the `isinstance(value, int)` check? Part of the point of `integer_check_long_py` is that there is no need for explicit type checking.

3. In `rational.pyx`, do you really need `IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:`?

Yes, I think when I wrote that one bit I just forgot I was in a Cython module.

For `Integer`, we add a specific hacked `tp_new` slot. See `fast_tp_new` in `integer.pyx`. This bypasses the Cython-generated `tp_new`, so Cython might optimize `Integer.__new__(Integer)` wrongly. This is not the case for `Rational`.

I guess the difference is mathematical: a `Morphism` must be a morphism (this means in particular that it is defined everywhere). Coercions are required to be morphisms, conversions may be maps which are not morphisms.

But I don't know how this mathematical difference is relevant for the implementation.

The answer is right in both the title and "component" of the ticket: "py3:".

This is far from the only "wrong" or at least "bad" code I've encountered in Sage in the course of making Python 3 (some of it is downright atrocious).  The focus of this changeset is to merely fix the bugs on Python 3.

> `int(x)` doesn't overflow

I was imprecise. The problem isn't that `int(x)` itself will overflow.  The behavior you cite is due to how `float.__int__` is implemented.  Not all the `__int__` in Sage return `long` objects (for Python 2) where it should.  Maybe that should be fixed (I can't remember a specific example), but it's safer to ask explicitly for a long.

I had already fixed those things...

I'm not sure why this change:

```
-        elif err == ERR_OVERFLOW:
+        elif isinstance(x, long):
```

Why a relatively slow `isinstance` when the whole point of `ERR_OVERFLOW` is that the value was already an int/long too big to fit in a C long?  At any rate, there's now an unused `cimport` of `ERR_OVERFLOW`...

> Why a relatively slow `isinstance`

First of all, it's not at all slow. This uses `PyLong_Check()` which has an optimized code path:

```C
#define PyLong_Check(op) \
        PyType_FastSubclass(Py_TYPE(op), Py_TPFLAGS_LONG_SUBCLASS)
```
This shouldn't take any measurable time.

The reason that I changed it is because I want to check the actual condition that I need: it must be an actual Python `long` since that is what `mpz_set_pylong` takes (without checking). It is really just an extra safety check.

I don't agree entirely with this change:

It seems safer and more natural to set `err[0] = ERR_INDEX` whenever any exception in `__index__` occurs. In any case, setting `err[0] = 0` is pointless because `integer_check_long_py()` is now guaranteed to set `err[0]` to some value.

I just reverted that. If you agree, you can set positive review.
