Right now one has for example

```
sage: G = GammaH(5*7^2,[197,106])
sage: M = ModularSymbols(G,sign=0)
sage: C = M.cuspidal_subspace()
sage: C.old_subspace()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
```
And this is because the degeneracy maps for GammaH are not implemented yet.

Component: **modular forms**
