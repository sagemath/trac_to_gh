First reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41170/search_doc-readable-format/. Running a command like `search_doc("curl", whole_word=True)` opens a window containing garbage. On my machine, a long string that starts:

```
aHRtbC9lbi9yZWZlcmVuY2UvZ2VuaW5kZXgtYWxsLmh0bWw6MTM5MTA6ICAgICAgPGxpPjxhIGhyZWY
```

The issue is that `search_src` frequently includes the non-ascii character "¶" in its results, and this breaks the Jupyter notebook pager. This character appears in lines without useful matches, so discard those matches.

The problem is that the output from `search_doc` regularly contains non-ascii characters, like "¶", and the IPython pager does not handle these well. We can catch the error and then remove the offending character, or we can try to skip those search matches altogether ("Permalink to this definition: ¶" is probably not a useful search result).

Thanks much John for investigating!
I confirm that the above search now displays non garbage with the above 
search on "curl".

However it still break on e.g.:

```
    search_doc("combinat")
```

Also, the rendering is still not as nice as in 
the old notebook where you get an itemized list of clickable links rather
than the plain text:

```
html/en/reference/genindex-all.html:14283:      <li><a href="manifolds/sage/manifolds/operators.html#sage.manifolds.operators.curl">curl() (in module sage.manifolds.operators)</a>
html/en/reference/genindex-all.html:14286:        <li><a href="manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield.html#sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorfield.VectorField.curl">(sage.manifolds.differentiable.vectorfield.VectorField method)</a>
```
This could be for a latter ticket though (to be mentioned in #25837).


Some minor additional suggestions:
- use `"XXX" not in line` rather than find
- add a doctest

When you say "IPython pager" I'm confused, because I thought we were talking about the notebook.  Why would anything in the notebook not properly handle non-ASCII characters?  And if so, I think that's something we should patch upstream rather than make our output worse.  Maybe I'm missing something though.

Nevermind; I reproduced the issue and I see it now.  Nevertheless, it's a bit surprising that this works for me fine at the command line and that it's broken in the notebook.  What's weirder is I don't know why containing non-ASCII characters should have anything to do with it.

The "garbage" that is displayed in the notebook is the base64-encoding of the expected output.  If I copy/paste the whole thing and wrap it in `print(base64.b64decode())`, the output from *that* displays just fine in the notebook, including the paragraph symbol.

I think something a little deeper to do with IPython output formatting is going on here.  I don't think we want a hack workaround; especially since there can be non-ASCII characters in other search results, and sometimes we'll want those too.

It seems that `search_doc` checks a global variable called `EMBEDDED_MODE`, which I guess is set somehow when running in the sage notebook.  If `EMBDEDDED_MODE` then it HTML-formats the results.  Whereas otherwise it just calls `IPython.core.page.page`.

I think I might understand the problem now: Although `search_doc` contains unicode characters, it's just returning the raw UTF-8 byte strings.  Your terminal knows how to display these.  But Jupyter is just treating this as a binary blob and displaying it in the notebook as base64.  We need to instead pass an actual unicode string (I'm guessing).  Further, I need to look into whether it's possible to pass HTML to the pager in supported contexts; I wonder if it supports multi-part MIME data like other Jupyter output contexts...

This is turning out to be something of a rabbit hole, as the old-style HTML-formatted results are...not great.  And as I pointed out above, broken in Jupyter, since the URLs to the results are only meaningful inside the legacy notebook.

Should I attach just an interim patch for the immediate issue, and push off updating the HTML results for another ticket, or just do it all at once?

How's this look for a start?  Aside from a few other minor code updates this doesn't change any functionality, but just improves support for unicode text in the existing behavior.  I will create a follow-up ticket for improving the HTML-formatted search results and making them work in the Jupyter Notebook.

Thanks again John to pointing out in the first place that the issue had to do with unicode characters, which is what led me in the right direction.

This can be a useful optimization in a loop, but in retrospect it will only be called in this case where there is a search match, which is relatively infrequent, so I agree there's not much benefit in this case.

            files.add(filename)
```
as long as `L` is nonempty and doesn't start with a colon, `filename` will be nonempty as well. Do you expect `L` to start with a colon? I tried a few cases and didn't see that come up.

I get one doctest failure when run with `sage -t --long --optional=sage,dochtml`:

```

Is this fixed by #26017? If so, should that ticket be a dependency of this one?

That's a good point.  The original code also would have broken if a filename started with a colon.  This should never be the case though so I'm not worried about it.
