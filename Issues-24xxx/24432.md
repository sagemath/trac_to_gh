We remove a lot of trivial `is_field`, `is_finite` and `cardinality` that can be dealt with the `ParentMethods` of category. Sometimes we have to properly refine the category with `.Finite()` or `.Infinite()`.
Some more delicate cases are treated in other tickets:
- polynomials in #24413
- number fields in #23418
