For what it's worth, in most cases naming a specific Windows version/update is not too relevant when it comes to Cygwin.  Although there *can* be API changes between major versions of Windows that impact how Cygwin works, it's not often, and is not a likely area in which third-party bugs are likely to be discovered (though not impossible).

So most issues with compiling on Cygwin can just mention "Cygwin".  A rare exception to this was #24121, but that's only because I was calling a built-in Windows command `ver`, so it had nothing directly to do with Cygwin.
