no ticket yet for the hex problem

in the experimental branch (https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=public/python3-experiment-8.1.rc0) that permit to start sage:

https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=public/python3-experiment-8.1.rc0&id=2ffe4e29422d4e331c65d16d7590fd9fb0bbd9b3

I just remove the alias. This is probably not a good solution.

Instead of the `try/except` and whatnot we could use `six.get_unbound_method()` for this.  The name is a bit long but can be rebound to something shorter in the import statement.
