This upstreams part of Debian's `u2-better-sphinx-failure-modes.patch` by Ximin Luo: we should not `.strip()` the lines that come out of Sphinx because this breaks indent in stack traces. Instead we should only `rstrip()` to remove the trailing newline.

After this one line change, I also wanted to make this doctestable, so I had to remove the global variable (which at least to me feels like a hack anyway.)

Finally, I added a copyright header sourced from the git log.
