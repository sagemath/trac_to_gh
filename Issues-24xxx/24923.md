Currently, the behaviour of sparse6 encoding and decoding for looped graphs with 1 vertex is inconsistent:

```python
sage: G = Graph([(0, 0)], loops=True)
sage: G.sparse6_string()
':@N'
sage: Graph(_)

   1150             self.allow_multiple_edges(False if multiedges is False else True, check=False)
   1151             from .graph_input import from_sparse6
-> 1152             from_sparse6(self, data)
   1153 
   1154         elif format == 'adjacency_matrix':

/home/janos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_input.pyc in from_sparse6(G, g6_string)
    103         for i in range(len(bits)//(k+1)):
    104             b.append(int(bits[(k+1)*i:(k+1)*i+1],2))
--> 105             x.append(int(bits[(k+1)*i+1:(k+1)*i+k+1],2))
    106         v = 0
    107         edges = []

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 2: ''
```

According to http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt, each edge is represented by `k+1` bits, where `k` is the number of bits needed to represent `n-1`. For `n = 1`, we should then have `k = 0` (`Integer(0).nbits()` agrees). Effectively, for a graph with a single vertex, the edge list should contain as many zero bits as there are loops on the vertex, followed by a padding consisting of one bits.

However, what currently happens is that when encoding, a zero is represented by a `0` bit, thus exceeding the `k = 0` bits for the vertex representation. This results in two zero bits per loop (note that in the above example, we have `ord('N')-63 = 15 = 001111`).

A separate issue affects the decoding process. There, `k = 0` is correctly identified, however this results in trying to parse an empty string, which throws the exception above.

This patch makes a special case when `n = 1`, resulting in both correct encoding and decoding:

```python
sage: G = Graph([(0, 0)], loops=True)
sage: G.sparse6_string()
':@^'
sage: Graph(_)
Looped multi-graph on 1 vertex
```

<a id='comment:5'></a>The patch is working well, and I tried also with multiple edges

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 0), (0,0)], loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.sparse6_string()
':@N'
sage: H = Graph(_)
sage: H
Looped multi-graph on 1 vertex

Can you add a doctest in the sparse6 encode / decoding methods, like:

```
Graphs with 1 vertex are correctly handled (:trac:`24923`)::

    sage: Graph([(0, 0)], loops=True).sparse6_string()
    ':@^'
    sage: G = Graph(_)
    sage: G.order(), G.size()
    (1, 1)
    sage: Graph([(0, 0), (0, 0)], loops=True, multiedges=True).sparse6_string()
    ':@^'
    sage: H = Graph(_)
    sage: H.order(), H.size()
    (1, 2)
