Elements of positive characteristic in the symbolic ring are complete nonsense

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: f(x) = exp(GF(3).one() * x)
sage: f
x |--> e^x
sage: bool(f(x) == exp(x))
True
sage: f(3*x)
1
```
or

```
sage: solve(x^2 == 2, [x])
[x == -sqrt(2), x == sqrt(2)]
sage: solve(x^2 == GF(3)(2), [x])
[x == -sqrt(2), x == sqrt(2)]
```

More dramatically, it leads to segmentation faults

```python
sage: x = polygen(GF(3))
sage: a = SR.var('a')
sage: (2*x + 1) * a
segmentation fault
```
Even going through conversion

```python
sage: p = SR(2*x + 1)
sage: p * a
segmentation fault
```

We simply disallow wrapping of element of positive characteristic in `SR`.

Solve #18787 and #21391

The real bug is that `SR(sigma)` succeeds (and returns something broken).
It should just fail, and then `*` will fail too, as it should.
