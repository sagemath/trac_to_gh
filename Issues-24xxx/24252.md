Work around the cyclic dependency of the Sage `Integer` class and the coercion model by introducing a new Cython header `integer_fake` with a minimal interface to `Integer` by doing a lazy import of `sage.rings.integer`.

(This does not strictly depend on #24245 but adding this dependency makes it easier to deal with a chain of dependencies of tickets building on this one).

Depends on #24245

Maybe it's not used a lot currently, but I would like to use it more. For example, #24247 requires this because you really want to special-case powering to an integer exponent. So that ticket is the real motivation for this one.
