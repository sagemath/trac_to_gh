There is no meaning for `is_transitively_reduced` in an undirected graph, so it should be moved to digraph.

The `transitive_reduction` is in `generic_graph.py` and defined for both graphs and digraphs. So either both methods should be restricted to digraphs and moved, or both methods should work on both graphs and digraphs.

For sure, the current implementation of the `transitive_reduction` method for `Graph` could be improved, using a spanning tree (forest) method. And testing if a graph is transitively reduced should be testing if it is a forest.

For directed graphs, we could certainly improve the current implementation of both methods.

Note also that both methods should failed if the input graph is immutable...

Why? There is `G = copy(self)` in the code.

I didn't know that `copy(self)` and `self.copy()` have different behaviors with respect the immutable property.

```
sage: G = Graph(1, immutable=True)
sage: copy(G).is_immutable()
False
sage: G.copy().is_immutable()
True
```

Should they be...? But at least the documentation says

"Please use this method only if you need to copy but change the underlying implementation or weightedness. Otherwise simply do copy(g) instead of g.copy()."

The `__copy__` method that is called when using `copy(G)`, always returns a mutable graph: `return self.copy(immutable=False)`. Good to know.

According to me, after closing of #26634, there is no need to move `is_transitively_reduced` to digraph.py as it is defined for both graph and digraph now.

So, either we should change milestone to `invalid/wontfix` or `positive_review` and `close`.
Any suggestions will be helpful.
