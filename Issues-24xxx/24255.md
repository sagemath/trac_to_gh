There is a long-standing problem with substitution in that some substitutions do not work when given as equality but do work when given as dictionary.

```
sage: (x*pi).subs(x*pi==e)
x*pi
sage: (x*pi).subs({x*pi:e})
e

sage: s = x.series(x,2); s
1*x + Order(x^2)
sage: (x*pi).subs(x*pi==s)
pi*x
```

It looks like that in some cases the conversion to dict switches lhs and rhs of the equation and this is because of such behaviour:

```
sage: x*pi==e
e == pi*x
sage: x == s
1*x + Order(x^2) == x
```

Why then would `class A():` not switch arguments? Anyway, this ticket either should warn if subclasses are encountered or at least add explanations to the documentation.

Okay the answer is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54867/what-is-the-difference-between-old-style-and-new-style-classes-in-python and Python is a PITA.
