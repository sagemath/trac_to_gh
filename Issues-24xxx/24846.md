Currently, the output object of the method `face_lattice` is not a lattice but a finite poset. This is also a good opportunity to revamp the method `Hasse_diagram_from_incidences` which is ill-named.

sage: %time P.face_lattice()
CPU times: user 44.7 ms, sys: 4.22 ms, total: 48.9 ms
Wall time: 40.8 ms
Finite poset containing 82 elements with distinguished linear extension
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A',4])
sage: %time P.face_lattice()
CPU times: user 95.7 ms, sys: 8.17 ms, total: 104 ms
