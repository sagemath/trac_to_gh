Currently, the output object of the method `face_lattice` is not a lattice but a finite poset. This is also a good opportunity to revamp the method `Hasse_diagram_from_incidences` which is ill-named.

Is it ill-named or ill-implemented, if it is in need of a revamp?-)

I'd say it is not an exclusive "or" in this case...!

The Hasse diagram is an oriented acyclic graph, whereas what is returned is a poset, not the Hasse diagram of that poset... So this is misleading. And I do not see why we could not readily return a LatticePoset object if it is already. (Maybe there are some reasons not to do this?)

This function is very handy sometimes and could be used for (abstract) combinatorial polytopes.

The comment

```
# In principle, it is recommended to use Poset or in this case perhaps
# even LatticePoset, but it seems to take several times more time
# than the above computation, makes unnecessary copies, and crashes.
```

can now be removed.

I suppose this is not going to change the speed (meets and joins will be lazy evaluated), but haven't tested that.
