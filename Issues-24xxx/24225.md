Ah, I just fixed a bunch of these myself :)  Glad I don't have to make a ticket for it now.

I might add a comment, at least a few of these cases, making it clear that the `isinstance(..., int)` case should *never* run on Python 3, since this is somewhat non-obvious, at least to me.

+        if isinstance(y, long):
+            # This should be treated basically the same as if y is an Integer
+            # so go ahead and convert y to an Integer first
+            y = Integer(y)
+
         # First case: Integer % Integer
         if type(x) is type(y):
             if not mpz_sgn((<Integer>y).value):
```

Edit: Originally a few of these diffs were the same as in #24221, but I think the ones here now are still new...
