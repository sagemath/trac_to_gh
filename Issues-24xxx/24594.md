Current behavior is to set all 3 axes to the same color. This enhancement would allow passing a list or tuple of 3 colors, one for each the X, Y and Z axes.


```
from sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d import axes
S = axes(6, 3, color=('red','blue','green'))
```

The default color would be set to black. This is different from current behavior, which does not set a default.

When the color keyword is a string, the single color applies each axis.
