Currently `Integer.__hash__` is implemented with `mpz_pythonhash`, which is designed to return the same hash value for built-in `int` and `long`s.

In Python 3 something changed subtly about the hash algorithm such that this no longer holds:

```
sage: hash(int(2^61))
1
sage: hash(2^61)
2305843009213693952
```

I haven't looked into what the difference is yet.  But I suspect this is the source of a number of errors I've seen.

Ah, you beat me to it.  I was doing roughly the same thing but with separate Python 2 and 3 branches, so your version is more "generic" I suppose.

I wonder if we an find some way to get away with not having to calculate `modulus` and `limb_bits` every time since they are constant, but it's just some bit shifts and maybe the compiler can optimize that out anyways.
