#23919 introduced numerous regressions in the Cygwin build.  Unfortunately this ticket was not tested by the Cygwin patchbot because it just didn't get to it (it is rather slow, and has been crashing lately for some reason).  I was also not made aware of this ticket.

Many headers included in newlib (Cygwin's libc) have some compatibility problems with `-std=c99`.  `-std=gnu99` tends to fare better.

In the short term I might just set that universally for Cygwin, rather than try to deal with each individual issue that comes up.

Keywords: **windows cygwin**

Smells good : after resetting --hard and pulling that branch again :
* `sage -b` finished without errors (at last !)
* `make` built the doc without problems.

Since this build is a bit of a chimera (different parts built with dufferent versions of `setup.py`), I'll give it a rebuild (`make distclean && make ptestlong`) before giving it positive review. This will take a while (especially if it gets interrupted by those pesky "Resource temporarily unavailable"...).

Thank you for your patience !

<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
Sage 8.1rc0 + #24121 + #24189 + #24191 + #24192 builds and passes ptestlong with two transient failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 114.5 src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 114.5 src/sage/misc/temporary_file.py  # 5 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Both doctests pass without error when ran standalone.

==>`positive_review`

Note : this is long (about 8 hours for full rebuild and tests, including about 1/4h lost due to a "Resource temporarily unavailable"...), on a virtual machine allocated 4 CPUs and 8 GB RAM.

This is mainly due to a long build : from install.log :

```
real	129m17,235s
user	179m33,147s
sys	102m1,896s
```
then

```
real	151m57,343s
user	242m18,472s
sys	54m40,605s
```


On the same bare metal, running Debian testing (8 CPUs, 16 GB RAM) :

```
real	54m55,725s
user	257m40,535s
sys	6m44,282s
```

About 281 minutes of real time vs 54 minutes. One notes
* 156 minutes of "sys" CPU time, vs about 7 minutes on "bare" Debian.
* 420 minutes of "user" CPU time, vs 257 minutes on "bare" Debian

Accounting for the avilability of about twice the resources on ""bare" Debian, that means that the large "Cygwin overhead" may be attributed at least in part to inefficiencies in system calls.

Things are different for Sage use, as exemplified by the doctests. On Cygwin :

```
Total time for all tests: 7468.6 seconds
    cpu time: 18746.4 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 26871.3 seconds
```

On the same bare metal :

```
Total time for all tests: 3397.3 seconds
    cpu time: 20643.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 26481.0 seconds
```

Both wall time and CPU times are roughly proportional to the available resources.

One is tempted to conclude that Cygwin is piss-poor at Sage development but results in an usable Sage. But of course, this is way too rough to be credible...

One also notes discrepancies between sum of "user" and "sys" times and total elapsed time. This may be due to more "system" activity on Windows. And the fact that Windows runs on a VM, which needs some CPU time for itself.

HTH,

It shouldn't take that long.  Also, are using the openblas or "atlas".  Selecting "atlas" and supplying `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib` will allow it to use the BLAS from Cygwin's lapack package which is going to be slower, but not typically *that* slow.

I need to rework BLAS installation so it can use the version from the system more easily and more explicitly.  While that does fall under my general work of making Sage use more system packages, this is a special enough case that it might be worth the effort for me to address it specifically now.  That way it would also be easier to use Cygwin's native openblas package.
