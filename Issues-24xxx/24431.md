```
There should be an automatic extension of scalars in the following situation

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: QQbar.gen() * x
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Algebraic Field' and
'Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field'
```
To be compared with

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: QQbar.gen() * x
I*x
sage: parent(_)
Power Series Ring in x over Algebraic Field
```

Currently, these pushouts are allowed:

```
sage: x = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 'x').gen()
sage: y = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'y').gen()
sage: x * y
x*y
sage: parent(x * y)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over
Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field
```
This is inconsistent with `PowerSeriesRing`.

By fixing these problems, we had to adapt some code in `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py` that was using the aforementioned pushout.

Depends on #24420
