There is at least a slight bug: `edge_cut` has default algorithm='FF', but the documentation says that `None` is the default.

A larger question: Should we try to unify functions so that `algorithm=None` would always be the default in all functions? For example `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py` has `silverman_height_bound` with default `algorithm='default'`.
