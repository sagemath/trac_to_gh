This is one of those cases where a class has a `dict` representation embedded in its repr, so where IPython would normally pprint the plain `dict` it does not pprint the embedded `dict`.

The `PolyDict` class is only used internally so this should be a low impact change, but that enhances its testability (especially in moving to Python 3).
