Finite quadratic/bilinear forms can be diagonalized for p!=2.
For p=2 they can be decomposed into blocks of size at most 2.
This is completely analogous to quadratic forms over the p-adics.

With further normalizations one can compute a normal form. In the sense that
two torsion quadratic forms are isomorphic if and only if they have the same normal form.
We follow the exposition of Miranda & Morrison Embeddings of Integral Quadratic forms

For odd p we could have diagonal values bigger than 1:
