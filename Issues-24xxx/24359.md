Working on #18514, it turns out that it is quite awkward that MeatAxe is a static library: MeatAxe uses some global variables, and *each* cython module using MeatAxe library functions needs to set these global variables.

So, purpose of this ticket: Change MeatAxe from static to dynamic.

Unfortunately, we aren't upstream for MeatAxe. We are already extensively patching the upstream sources, both adding features and fixing bugs. But upstream isn't really active, the last release is several years old, and they seemed reluctant to consider our patches.

Therefore I created a fork, that I call SharedMeatAxe, as it provides a shared library. It provides (in contrast to upstream MeatAxe)
- an autotools build system
- a shared library
- a test suite that can be run in parallel and passes `make distcheck`
- some bug fixes
- a speedup in echelon computation
- asymptotically fast matrix multiplication, that is faster than schoolbook multiplication even for rather small matrices.
Also it fixes some errors in the documentation.

The tarball of the fork is available at http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~king/SharedMeatAxe/shared_meataxe-1.0.tar.gz

The package documentation is at http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~king/SharedMeatAxe/

Problems:
- I have no idea what needs to be changed in MeatAxe's Makefile to build a dynamic library.
- I have no idea what needs to be changed in MeatAxe's Makefile to link against the newly created dynamic library. Is there a syntactical difference for linking against static resp. dynamic libraries? Or is it just `-lmtx` in both cases?
- Is it a problem when the static `libmtx.a` is still around from a previous installation of meataxe? I.e., is it needed that `spkg-install` removes `libmtx.a` before creation of the dynamic library?

Actually I already successfully autoconfiscated a package: David Green did not use autotools for his projective resolution programs, but when I became upstream, I made it use autotools.

However, I consider it as a crucial difference that I am not upstream for MeatAxe. So, I am somehow reluctant to completely change the build system.

OTOH, I did provide rather invasive patches for MeatAxe (e.g., one adding asymptotically fast matrix multiplication). So, I am not categorically against a patch that commits autoconfiscation...

Anyhow, if I were you I would have just forked MeatAxe and forgot about non-cooperating upstream.

Not that I have much more experience with this, but yes, this book is probably the best source.

As this code does not have any nontrivial dependencies (according to a quick look at the makefile), I guess it's about 

* figuring out what sources (*.c and *.h) are, probably 
  putting all *.h into a separate include/ directory, 
  I would keep the library sources in src/ but create another directory, say progs/, 
  for sources of the executables.
* figuring out what to install: headers, library, executables
* figuring out what to test.

Then, putting Makefile.am in the appropriate directories;
for include/ you'd want an 1-line Makefile.am with `nobase_include_HEADERS =`
I'd go for include/meataxe/, then you'd need to modify sources to have meataxe/ in
`#include <>` statements (this is for headers you need installed, I gather, but there
is no harm in installing them all in meataxe/)

The Makefile.am in src/ will deal with building the library; the one in progs with executables, the one in test/ with testing.

configure.ac would be very trivial...

Sure, currently the meataxe headers are there, too.

I don't understand what that means. Currently, there is `#include "meataxe.h"`. Are you saying that I need to change it into `#include "meataxe/meataxe.h"`? But why? Wouldn't "make build" take place in some build directory whose structure mimics the source structure, whereas the transfer of headers to `include/meataxe` would only happen during "make install"?

> The Makefile.am in src/ will deal with building the library; the one in progs with executables, the one in test/ with testing.

I need to figure out what to do so that Makefile.am in test/ will only be executing if someone does "make test".

No, that's not what I meant, but indeed if you only need to install meataxe.h, and no
other headers, then you may leave it as it is.
However, it's bad practice to mix *.c and *.h in the same dir.
Still I'd create include/ and move all the *.h files there.
Then if your AC_CONFIG_FILES in configure.ac mentions `include/Makefile`
the building setup with add the relevant `-I../include/` or something like this to
the compilation commands.

IIRC, `nobase_include_HEADERS = meataxe.h` in include/ will then make sure that
`make install` copies `meataxe.h` (and no other headers) to where it should go, i.e. `$SAGE_LOCAL/include`. (But I might be wrong on this one, it could be that you must list all the *.h files there, and then they would all get installed, something you rather want to avoid, I guess. Not sure.)

I think this is made sure by mentioning in test/Makefile.am the corresponding executables in 
`check_PROGRAMS =`, and not in `bin_PROGRAMS =`. The latter is for executables to be installed by `make install`.

So far, I thought I should keep the upstream sources and add yet another patch. The patch would define the change from the upstream build system to whatever comes out by applying autotools.

However, autotools creates a lot of files, say, INSTALL, COPYING, makefile.in, config.h.in, etc, and if I understand correctly these are all files supposed to be part of a distribution, i.e., the patch would add all those files and would thus be HUGE.

Wouldn't it then be better to fork MeatAxe, after all?

I.e., remove the old build system, apply autotools, create `meataxe-2.4.24.p4.tar.gz` by `make dist` (IIRC that's one of the make targets provided by automake), and post this on my web page? Then, the current patches from `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/meataxe/patches` will already be part of the .tar.gz.

I just checked that meataxe 2.5 is still not using autotools. But how to tell upstream about it without creating anger?

Supporting dynamic libraries on a variety of platforms basically requires using autotools or cmake, otherwise it is a nightmare.

Sage has quite some experience with autotoolising upstreams, usually it ends up well.
Cliquer (https://github.com/dimpase/autocliquer/) was an exception, upstream declined our patches, for reason that the software has not been touched for 6 or 7 years, and that the code never included outside contributions in the past.

I think *reasonable* people would gladly accept these changes...

What would then happen with the current optional "meataxe" spkg and with the OptionalExtension depending on it? Would `sage -i meataxe` henceforth install automeataxe? But how would that work, given that `sage -i bla` looks in upstream for the latest version of bla (so that `sage -i meataxe` couldn't pick up automeataxe)?

A static library provided by meataxe and a dynamic library provided by automeataxe can't coexist, I believe.

I just thought: Maybe a dynamic library is not a good solution, in particular if it comes to parallel computation?

libmtx has global C variables not only for the folders holding multiplication tables, but also for the current field and the current row length. Since the library is static, any Cython module and any executable linked against libmtx has their own copy of these variables, and it means that they are all obligated to set the appropriate variables.

Suppose we would use a dynamic library instead. Now imagine a computation in which functions from different Cython modules A,B,C and different executables D,E,F are supposed to deal with matrices of different dimensions. When they are all linked against the same dynamic library, chaos would result: If module A changed the row size and executable E would pick that up, it would undoubtedly crash.

Am I right that this would happen?

If "yes", then it is a show stopper, and we can mark this ticket as invalid.

Global variables in dynamic libraries are only shared on the level of programs. Two different programs (regardless of whether it's the same executable or same user) won't share anything.

So, in practice, the relevant difference between static and shared for Sage will be if *different* Cython modules use the same library.

Since parallel computation will most likely involve just one Cython module, I don't see an issue there.

meataxe package would use automeataxe tarball---tarball name can be more or less arbitrary.
The package name won't have to change - it's just the name of the upstream project.
See how this is done with cliquer.

MeatAxe defines various symbols during its hand-made initialisation. Among them:
- MTX_CONFIG_BIG_ENDIAN
- MTX_BUILD and MTX_VERSION
- MTX_CONFIG_LONG32 and MTX_CONFIG_LONG64
- MTX_CONFIG_STRING

Some of them are only used in the docs, some are used in a file `intio.c`.

Question: How can autoconf be used to define these symbols? I.e., how can I check during configuration whether the machine is big or little endian and whether it is 32 or 64 bit? So far, I only found runtime tests, and in fact the upstream hand-made configuration of MeatAxe first executes a little C code that at its runtime checks the machine and then defines the above symbols, so that the rest of the code knows the configuration at compile time.

For the record, the current configuration works like this:

```
tmp/config.h: tmp/mk.dir Makefile Makefile.conf src/genconfig.c svnversion
	@echo "Generating config.h"
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o tmp/genconfig src/genconfig.c
	@tmp/genconfig >$@
```
and the resulting header is then included in two files, `intio.c` and `version.c`. The former C file relies on endianness and 32/64bit architecture. The latter C file provides an environment variable `MtxVersion`, which is then used to print help resp. status information.

Again, the question is how that would change when using autotools?

which you can use for endianness detection.
For the version etc there is  AC_INIT, which is typically used for setting the version.

For 32 vs 64 bits, use AC_CHECK_SIZEOF

I made some progress: The library and the executables of SharedMeatAxe (that's the name I chose) build.

I now need to see how to run MeatAxe's test suite and how to build MeatAxe's documentation (they use doxygen).

What I don't understand: After installation, I expected to find a single shared library in lib/, but I find:

```
$ ls lib
libmtx.a  libmtx.la  libmtx.so	libmtx.so.0  libmtx.so.0.0.0
```
In particular, the static library libmtx.a is there as will. Is that not a problem?

Also, would it be a problem (e.g. for the OptionalExtension sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense) that meataxe.h is not installed directly in include/ but in include/shared_meataxe/?

I am stuck with the question: How to build the documentation using autotools?

In "Autotools - A practitioner's guide...", the description on doxygen was obscure to me, and web search also didn't help me to understand what needs to be done.

For reference, here is the doc related part of the original Makefile:

```Makefile
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Documentation
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.PHONY: doc

rebuild-doc:
	rm -rf doc
	mkdir -p doc
	doxygen etc/Doxyfile >/dev/null

doc: doc/index.html

doc/index.html: etc/Doxyfile $(PROGRAMS:%=src/%.c) $(LIB_OBJS:%=src/%.c) src/meataxe.h src/meataxe.doc src/changelog.doc
	mkdir -p doc
	doxygen etc/Doxyfile >/dev/null
```

How can one check for the presence of doxygen? How can one translate the above into an appropriate Makefile.am that should probably reside in doc/?

I don't know if this is an autotools question or a doxygen question.

I am now able to get a make target "doxygen-doc". It somehow creates a documentation, but unfortunately I meet three problems:
- The html pages created by doxygen are not as thorough as with the original MeatAxe. Namely, the data structures are documented, but the modules are not, and also the main page is basically empty.
- When trying to build the pdf documentation, latex complains about a missing file `refman.tex`. Am I supposed to create that file? Is it supposed to be autogenerated? Why is it not autogenerated? I am a bit stuck.
- `make uninstall` does not remove the created documentation.

In relation with doxygen, this is what I did:
- In configure.ac:

  ```
  DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([shared_meataxe], [$(top_srcdir)/etc/Doxyfile], [doc])
  DX_DOXYGEN_FEATURE(ON)
  ```
- In Makefile.am:

  ```
  @DX_RULES@
  
  MOSTLYCLEANFILES = DX_CLEANFILES
  ```

The Makefile generated by autotools/configure is then calling doxygen with these environment variables:

```
SRCDIR='../autoconfiscate' PROJECT='shared_meataxe' VERSION='1.0' PERL_PATH='/usr/bin/perl' HAVE_DOT='NO' GENERATE_MAN='NO' GENERATE_RTF='NO' GENERATE_XML='NO' GENERATE_HTMLHELP='NO' GENERATE_CHI='NO' GENERATE_HTML='YES' GENERATE_LATEX='YES'
```

Do you have an idea what is the point about the obscure `refman.tex`, why some stuff's documentation is created but other stuff's isn't, why the main doc page is empty and why the doc files aren't uninstalled?

> SharedMeatAxe is the package name that I currently propose. Dima suggested AutoMeatAxe. However, I prefer a name that indicates what the package provides (namely: A shared MeatAxe library) over a name that tells how the package is built (namely: With autotools).

It doesn't matter how you call your package. The header file doesn't depend on whether it's plain old MeatAxe or SharedMeatAxe or AutoMeatAxe. So I simply wouldn't change the header file name or location.

The setting is:
- I have a directory in which I build the package: `~/Projekte/Meataxe/build`.
- The configure script resides in `~/Projekte/Meataxe/autoconfiscate`
- The C sources are in `~/Projekte/Meataxe/autoconfiscate/src`
- The Doxygen file is in `~/Projekte/Meataxe/autoconfiscate/etc`

When doing `make doxygen-doc`, I see

```
error: the type 'dirs' is not supported for the entry tag within a navindex! Check your layout file!
```
Later, it says

```
Preprocessing /home/king/Projekte/MeatAxe/build/config.h...
Parsing file /home/king/Projekte/MeatAxe/build/config.h...
Preprocessing /home/king/Projekte/MeatAxe/build/include/meataxe.h...
Parsing file /home/king/Projekte/MeatAxe/build/include/meataxe.h...
```
which probably explains why some documentation is in fact created.

And then, latex starts:

```
writing tag file...
lookup cache used 523/65536 hits=1630 misses=530
finished...
echo Timestamp >doc/shared_meataxe.tag
cd doc/latex; \
rm -f *.aux *.toc *.idx *.ind *.ilg *.log *.out; \
/usr/bin/latex refman.tex; \
/usr/bin/makeindex refman.idx; \
/usr/bin/latex refman.tex; \
countdown=5; \
```

If refman.tex is expected, but not provided, I suppose that upstream didn't want pdf documentation to be created. The documentation that is shipped with the upstream meataxe package is html only.

However, I don't understand how to make doxygen consider the whole src directory, rather than only config.h and meataxe.h

It could be that the original package does not work with the up-to-date doxygen;
if you google for the error message `the type 'dirs' is not supported for the entry tag within a navindex!` you will see that it might be due to a (relatively) recent doxygen update.

Yes, I just tested it. I need to be in the top-level directory. I simply did

```
$ doxygen etc/Doxyfile
```
Then, html documentation was created in the ./doc/ folder, using all the files from the ./src/ folder. 

So, I guess the question is how to achieve that automake is issuing the doxygen command in the top-level directory of the source tree (NOT in src/, but one level above src/, and also not in the build/ directory).

Yes, the error occurs with the upstream package as well. However, the "error" is more a warning, as the documentation still builds in a useful way.

By the way, did you understand how the layout file is supposed to change? Because I didn't.

IMHO, you don't need to tweak autoconf stuff for this, you need to tweak Doxyfile
to have `INPUT = ` specifying directories you need to process.

You are right! Upstream says `INPUT = .`. But when I change it to

```
INPUT                  = $(SRCDIR)
```
then the html doc build fine.

However, the pdf documentation is not available. I guess that's because refman.tex is not automatically generated by doxygen (which I find strange).

Can you tell me how I can achieve that `make uninstall` removes the documentation?

Another problem:
So far I am unable to convince doxygen that it is NOT supposed to try and apply LaTeX on the documentation. Also, I am unable to convince doxygen to create the documentation in a directory different from `$(prefix)/doc`.

I tried to put

```
DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([shared_meataxe], [$(top_srcdir)/etc/Doxyfile], [$(docdir)])
```
and was configuring with `--docdir=...`, but the html documentation was still built in doc/, not in the folder that I indicated by `--docdir` --- however, a certain tag was attempted to create in `$(docdir)`, which failed!

Any idea?

For the record: I am now also fixing MeatAxe's documentation: Most doxygen sections are incorrectly created: The first word after `@`section is supposed to be a globally unique section label, if I understand correctly, but upstream just start with what is supposed to be the section title, or starts with a non-unique label.

Also, they are still documenting a stand-alone program for the creation of multiplication tables, that was removed.

The more upstream bugs I am fixing, the more I think it is justified to say that I am forking MeatAxe.

I am now done with the docs and making some progress with getting the test suite to run.

Automake would run several test scripts in parallel, which I'm OK with. However, upstream doesn't seem to think of parallel tests: Several test scripts write test data into local files WITH THE SAME NAME.

Solution: I want to create a sub-directory for each individual test. That sub-directory should be created with `mkdir -p`. However, `mkdir -p` is (if I understand correctly) not available on all supported platforms.

When I put `AC_PROG_MKDIR_P` into configure.ac, then the variable `MKDIR_P` gets defined into the resulting Makefile. However, `MKDIR_P` is not visible for the test scripts.

So, what shall I do?
- Use `mkdir -p` in my test scripts, although it may not be fully portable?
- How can I obtain an environment variable for `MKDIR_P` that the test scripts can use?

I found something that works:
- In my Makefile.am, I define check-local and let it create a little script that exports MKDIR_P
- In the tests, I first let that script be executed, and by consequence the variable is then available.

Is there a more elegant solution, or is creating a custom temporary script fine?

Let's define what we mean by "scripts". In the first place, I am talking about "test scripts". They are essential for the test suite.

In order to be able to run tests in parallel, it is essential that each test script has its own directory in which it stores its results. Hence, my aim was that each test script creates such a directory, named `test_$$`, where as usual `$$` provides the PID of a script.

Of course, the Makefile is unaware of the PIDs of the test scripts. Therefore, Makefile can not be made responsible for creation of the directories. By consequence, I need that `mkdir -p` works IN THE TEST SCRIPTS.

Exporting MKDIR_P in the Makefile simply doesn't work. That was the first thing I tried, but the corresponding environment variable isn't visible for the test scripts.

Hence, my solution: Makefile creates a helper script that exports MKDIR_P (of course, Makefile is able to dump the value of that variable into the script!), and each test script sources the helper script. Problem solved.

Actually, I now have a SharedMeatAxe 1.0 creating a dynamic library and executables; it passes the full MeatAxe test suite, can create docs, `make clean` works fine, and `make uninstall` removes both the binaries, the library and the docs.

So, it basically is ready for publication.

> However, it seems that you rather want to create temporary directories/files directly, make tests output to stdout, and redirect it to temporary files.

No. It is not about text written to stdout. The MeatAxe test suite is testing executables, that read input from data files, and write output into data files. So, during parallel tests, it must not happen that several tests have output data files of the same name. Hence, the need to use a temporary directory.

So, during parallel tests, it must not happen that several tests have output data files of the same name. Hence, the need to use a temporary directory.

Or perhaps I can really proceed differently. The name scheme for the test scripts is `t-0000`, `t-0001`, etc. So, the Makefile could create unique directories `test_0000`, `test_0001` etc, and then each script can cd into its designated directory and do its job.

However, how to do this most easily using autotools?

Currently, the test suite is implemented like this in Makefile.am:

```
TESTS                 = zzztest t-0100 t-0000 \
	t-0100 t-0100 t-0105 t-0106 t-0107 t-0108 t-0109 t-0110 t-0111 t-0112 \
	t-0113 t-0114 t-0115 t-0116 t-0117 t-0118 t-0200 t-0201 t-0210 t-0211 \
	t-0212 t-0213 t-0214 t-0215

check-local:
	@echo "CREATING ENV"
	@echo 'export MKDIR_P="@MKDIR_P@"' > MKDIR_P_ENV
	@chmod +x MKDIR_P_ENV
```
As you can see, `make check` first creates the `MKDIR_P_ENV` helper script, and then calls all the test scripts `t-0100` etc., which in turn source the `MKDIR_P_ENV` helper script.

I will now try to work with a list of numbers that are both used to generate the list of TESTS and a list of test directories.

Don't forget `make distcheck`. That's the all-in-one autotools testsuite. If it passes that, you should be good to go.

It fails, but perhaps for an interesting reason: The test suite uses certain binaries. When the test suite is run during `make distcheck`, these binaries can't be found.

Why is that? Doesn't `make distcheck` do `make install`? Or do I need to append to PATH when running tests?

I can reproduce the problem with `make distcheck` as follows:
- configure
- make all
- make check

When I instead do
- configure
- make install
- make check

then things work.

I see that the missing binaries are built in src/ before being installed. So, is it a correct solution to add src/ to the PATH during the tests?

REALLY obscure.

- Why should I do `export CPPFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include $CPPFLAGS"` if the **standard way to proceed** is to `configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`?
- Where do sdh_* functions come from? Where are they documented?
- What would possibly be the benefit of `sdh_make_install` over the standard `$MAKE install`? The latter is even shorter!

Sorry, I am escalating myself into a rant. So far, I don't see even a weak reason to use sdh_*.

In a Sage shell:

```
(sage-sh) king@king-C70-B:sage$ which sdh_make_install
(sage-sh) king@king-C70-B:sage$ find . -name sdh_make_install
```
So, I'd say sdh_make_install does not even exist.

Right, but I was just referring to the `sdh_` commands. I didn't mean to copy the `spkg-install` file verbatim.

In all those cases, they are there for a reason: the reason is that those packages were created on a system with outdated autotools(*). Those `config.guess` and `config.sub` files detect the system type and won't recognize certain newer systems if they are too old. For you shared_meataxe package, the timestamp of those files (i.e. the timestamp of autotools(*) on *your system*) is `2015-08-20` which should be sufficiently recent.

(*) Don't ask me which particular component of autotools. That may even depend on how a distro packages autotools.

> Is there a disadvantage of having them?

I guess not, except that it is clutter in the `spkg-install` file.

What does "little-endian mode" mean? Is it perhaps the case that the configuration script mistakenly believes that the machine is big-endian?

> What does "little-endian mode" mean?

It means little-endian.

The whole story is that this is a CPU which supports both little-endian and big-endian. I believe that the mode is chosen when booting the system. In any case, on that system everything (from kernel to user executables) is little endian.

One thing which is different from other architectures is that the `char` type is unsigned. On most common systems, the range of a `char` is -128 to 127. On ppc64le, the range is 0 to 255.

I found at least one instance where this is causing a bug: in `src/intio.c`, in the function `SysReadLong32`:

```
((long)(char)a[3] << 24)
```
should be replaced by

```
((long)(signed char)a[3] << 24)
```

I believe it's the same on ARM, but I'm not sure...

> Would that be OK with all non-exotic and exotic architectures?

I don't see why not. `signed char` is explicitly a signed number.

> Then I should probably grep all the sources for "char", and replace everything by "signed char".

Except when `char` really means a character of a string. But given that the Sage testsuite passes on this `ppc64le` system, the problem of `char` probably doesn't occur in too many places.

Some more testing revealed that the problem with the `_out` directories is not fixed. But the issue is a race condition: I believe that `check-local` is simply an additional test target. It is unspecified whether this is run before/during/after the other tests.

But why don't you simply create the directory in the test script? That would be the easiest solution.

According to the Autotools documentation I'm using:

```
Automake recognizes and honors -local extensions for the following standard targets:
  all info dvi
  ps pdf html
  check install-data install-dvi
  install-exec install-html install-info
  install-pdf install-ps uninstall
  installdirs installcheck clean distclean mostlyclean
  maintainer-clean
Adding a -local to any of these in your Makefile.am files will cause the
associated commands to be executed before the standard target.
```

So, it is weird that you find a race condition. Is that a bug in automake?

No, I don't think so. `MKDIR_P` is there for a reason, but (as was discussed in some comments above), `MKDIR_P` is not available for the test scripts.

Apparently, `MKDIR_P` is one of `mkdir -p`, `install-sh -d`, or `mkinstalldirs`. So, it makes sense to not hard-code `mkdir -p`.

There are two other solutions to that:

1. `mkdir DIR 2>/dev/null` (just let `mkdir` fail but hide the error)

2. `rm -rf DIR; mkdir DIR` (remove the directory before creating it)

It's either a bug in automake or its documentation.

I don't see why that would make a difference. It wouldn't solve the problem that `check-local` is not a dependency of `check-TESTS`.

Probably you are using parallel `make`. Try a serial make (`make -j1`) instead.

In the now-posted package version, I take the latter approach.

Hopefully it works now, including big-endian and "char = unsigned char" architectures, both 32- and 64-bit, both parallel and serial build...

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:154):
> There is a build issue involving the Cython module `matrix_gfpn_dense`, I'll elaborate when I figured out what it is. While testing #24445,

#24445 is (from my point of view) a dependency for this ticket. So, why are you blaming this ticket for a failure in #24445?

I could imagine, though, that it leads to problems to first test stuff here (with SharedMeatAxe), then go back and test #24445 (with unshared MeatAxe). Could you check if while testing #24445 you still have libmtx.so (which belongs to this ticket) around, or only have libmtx.a (which belongs to #24445)?

Could you elaborate what you mean by "belonging to #24445"? If I recall correctly, the "modern" way of thinking is that a git commit does not "belong" to a ticket (in contrast to a patch).

Also note that there is one commit that changes an error message for a test that was introduced at #24445. The old and new meataxe versions are off by one line. So, please be careful that you don't think this commit belongs to #24445.

Now I'm confused. I was sure that I merged the two, and there was indeed one error message where a line number in os.c (from meataxe) changes between meataxe versions. But when I now look at the commits from my original branch, I cannot see that #24445 is included.

Anyway, git blame shows me that error message that is to be expected with SharedMeatAxe was introduced in commit 8a42fe1c, and then I get

And you are right in the sense that that test does not belong to #24445.

Anyway, the build error you are reporting seems very strange.

The build issue is that the `mtx` library should exist **if and only if** meataxe is installed. This can be ensured by deleting all `mtx` libraries before installing meataxe.

In detail: the build-time check in `src/module_list.py` checks whether or not the "meataxe" package is marked as installed but the run-time check for the `matrix_gfpn_dense` module checks whether it can be imported.

> Exactly. But then what is the point of the `$MAKE uninstall` that you added? It's not technically *wrong* but as far as I can tell, it doesn't serve any purpose.

If you prefer, we can remove the previous commit.

That is indeed also an issue, but unrelated to the Cython issue from [comment:154] that [13828d1](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/13828d1cb042ce03148d3319bdfecee1ec54862f) is meant to fix.

This issue with downgrading cannot easily be fixed since we cannot retro-actively patch the current meataxe in 8.2.beta2. Luckily, the consequences are not severe: in the worst case, your new SharedMeatAxe from this ticket will be used on downgraded installations of Sage.
