The easiest way I've found for dealing with interfaces that use `subprocess.Popen` is, on Python 3, to simply specify an encoding for the subprocess I/O.  Unfortunately this argument doesn't exist on Python 2 (a wrapper for this might be nice but the examples are few enough that I haven't been compelled to bother).

Once this is documented, I am very happy to give this a positive review.
