Ok, looks good. Is this poset selfdual, or not ?

Is the `PowerPoset` the same as the picture on page 8 of 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07995.pdf

No, this is different thing. Elements of this poset are posets. The bottom element is the antichain on elements `1..n` (actually `0..n-1`), and maximal elements are all `n!` chains.

It would.

Volker doesn't like modifying tickets already in positive review, so I will combine this with some other changes.
