There are a number of methods in pynac's `ginac/numeric.cpp` module that don't check for error results from `PyObject_RichCompareBool` (which returns -1 on error).

This leads to unhandled exceptions that, on Python 2, were somewhat by luck being cleared via `PyObject_Clear()` later in the call stack.

On Python 3, the interpreter asserts `PyErr_Occurred` in more places and we don't get so lucky.

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/297

Keywords: pynac

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Yes, this still looks like what I described.  On Python 3 the exception leaks out, and slightly later on a call to `PyObject_IsInstance` in turn calls the type's `__instancecheck__` which goes through `_PyObject_FastCallDict` which in turn asserts `PyErr_Occurred`.

On Python 3 there is no `_PyObject_FastCallDict`, no assertion checks on `PyErr_Occurred` in the relevant code path, and eventually that error gets cleared.
