There are a number of methods in pynac's `ginac/numeric.cpp` module that don't check for error results from `PyObject_RichCompareBool` (which returns -1 on error).

This leads to unhandled exceptions that, on Python 2, were somewhat by luck being cleared via `PyObject_Clear()` later in the call stack.

On Python 3, the interpreter asserts `PyErr_Occurred` in more places and we don't get so lucky.

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/297

**Assignee:** @jdemeyer

**CC:**  @rwst

**Keywords:** pynac

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Resolution:** duplicate

On Python 3 there is no `_PyObject_FastCallDict`, no assertion checks on `PyErr_Occurred` in the relevant code path, and eventually that error gets cleared.
