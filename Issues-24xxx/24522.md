There are a number of methods in pynac's `ginac/numeric.cpp` module that don't check for error results from `PyObject_RichCompareBool` (which returns -1 on error).

This leads to unhandled exceptions that, on Python 2, were somewhat by luck being cleared via `PyObject_Clear()` later in the call stack.

On Python 3, the interpreter asserts `PyErr_Occurred` in more places and we don't get so lucky.
