If we have two libgap groups, then we can use GAP to define and work with homomorphisms.

<a id='comment:14'></a>I changed/fixed a few things:

- Made the homset a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation` (this is the more standard practice).
- Made the homset use `element_class` to construct elements; this fixes the `TestSuite` (I was previously thinking it was the morphism itself that was failing, not how the morphism was constructed).
- Doc fixes.
- Fixed the `_latex_` of the abelian GAP group so now `view(G)` works.

If my changes look good, then positive review.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Looks good except for one point:
`GroupHomomorphismByImages` allways checks whether the generators define a group homomorphism.
We have to use `GroupHomomorphismByImagesNC` if we do not want to check this (as it can be expensive).

<a id='comment:31'></a>There is another bug:

```
try:
    if G.is_finite() and H.is_finite():
        category = category.Finite()
    except NotImplementedError:
```
This is dangerous as determining whether a group is finite or not may be impossible.
Hence I remove this.

Mhh, guess you are right, but then I do not know how to fix the doctests.
Something up in the coercion model breaks.

Even if it does not error out, the computation may be very expensive. We do not want to trigger that when just creating a homset.
Especially, since being a homomorphism in the category of finite groups does not change anything.

Really `is_finite` should be a fast check (and error out if it doesn't know if it is finite or not). The other test you could do is `X in Groups().Finite()`, which is a property that has to be explicitly given upon construction. Even so, we should make it future-proof for when such code is added.
