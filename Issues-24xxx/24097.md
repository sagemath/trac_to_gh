```
As discussed [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/r920G2EVTBU/1-Xk7ZIEAgAJ), when cythonizing a module, the hard-coded path to that file saved in the module is written as a relative path if the current working directory is somewhere along the path that the module file resides.

That is, if the cython module is at

```
/home/sage/.sage/temp/cython/mymodule.pyx
```

and the current working directory is `/home/sage`, then the module's path is written as

```
.sage/temp/cython/mymodule.pyx
```
.

This breaks `sage.misc.sageinspect._extract_embedded_position` which assumes that files generated with `cython()` are relative to the `SPYX_TMP` variable.

This could be considered a defect in Cython, but it's also easy to work around for now by chdir()-ing into the `SPYX_TMP` directory before running `cythonize()`.

That is not a wild guess. This is correct for functions in the Sage library, which is the most important use case.

OK, I see your point and I agree.

But then I have some further comments:

1. Instead of changing the directory to `target_dir` and then using some dubious code in `_extract_embedded_position` to reconstruct the path, why not change directory to some other directory (say `SAGE_LOCAL`) to force Cython to write an absolute path in the first place?

2. Only the `cythonize()` call should be inside the `restore_cwd()` context, not the whole `try/except` block.

Sorry, I was unclear. It's not a "wild guess" and I agree that part of the code is actually fine.  All I meant was that it's still a *heuristic* approach that can in theory be wrong (but probably isn't).

I considered that, but it seemed like *more* of a hack around Cython.  The current approach feels more explicit, along the lines of how we guess a path might be relative to `SAGE_SRC`.

True, but you could also argue the other way around it makes less clear exactly what the exception handling pertains to.  In this case it's clear enough, but it's also just as clear that there's nothing in the exception handling that's dependent on the current directory.  

Perhaps in a case like this the context manager is almost more of a distraction and deserves to be simply a `finally:` statement.  I just added it because I've written the same context manager almost every time I've wanted some code that temporarily changes directories.
