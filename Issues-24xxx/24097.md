It is possible to add assumptions on sympy symbols:

```
sage: from sympy import Symbol
sage: n = Symbol("n", integer=True)
```

However, these are lost when converting to `SR`:

```
def _sympysage_symbol(self):
    """
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sympy import Symbol
        sage: assert x._sympy_() == Symbol('x')
        sage: assert x == Symbol('x')._sage_()
    """
    from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
    return SR.var(self.name)
```

This is the indirect cause for the different results below (based on a doctest in `src/sage/tests/french_book/recequadiff.py`):

```
sage: from sympy import Symbol, rsolve_hyper
sage: n = Symbol("n", integer=True)
sage: rsolve_hyper([-2,1], 2^(n+2), n)
2**n*C0 + 2**(n + 2)*(C0 + n/2)
sage: rsolve_hyper([-2,1], 2^(2+n), n)
2**n*C0 - 2**(n + 2)
```
