`RealNumber` in Sage is the class for floating-point real numbers. `ComplexNumber` is a function that aims to do the same for complex numbers but its implementation is very wrong.

```
sage: a = CC('1.233123145515341')
sage: b = ComplexNumber(a.real(), a.imag())
1.233123145515340
sage: ComplexNumber(a.real(), a.imag()) == b
False
```
We should either remove this function or improve it.
