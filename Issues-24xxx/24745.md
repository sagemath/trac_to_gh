The following operation creates a leak

```
pi * I * RR.one()
```

This can be tested with

```
import gc

def num_complex():
    gc.collect()
    return sum(1 for t in gc.get_objects() if type(t) is sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber)

for _ in range(10):
    print num_complex()
    for _ in range(10):
        a = pi * I * RR.one()
```
