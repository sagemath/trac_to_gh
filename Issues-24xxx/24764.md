The `cython()` command no longer finds `.pxd` files in the current working directory. This was probably broken in #24097 because we now build from a different directory. A simple solution is to add the original working directory to the `include_path` of Cython.

I can confirm this works with my external code.

I don't know why two tests are failing on patchbot: they pass on my machine.

beta5 in general was quite broken on the patchbots. Ideally, the bots should retest it with beta6.

Yeah, the tests that fail seem to be related to Cython. Let's wait for beta6, then.
