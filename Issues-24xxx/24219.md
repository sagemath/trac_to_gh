```
sage: RealField(2)(1) >= 5/4
True
```
This is clearly wrong.

The reason is that `5/4` is first converted to a 2-bit
floating-point number, which is `1` in mode to nearest, then the comparison is made.

I did not ask `t >= RealField(2)(5/4)`, but `t >= 5/4`.
Does the following convince you? Note that 6*t is exactly representable in 2-bit precision.

```
sage: t = RealField(2)(1)
sage: t >= 7/6
True
sage: 6*t >= 7
False
```

Coercion is supposed to be exact (mathematically), so it can not guess anything from an approximate real number. Going from R to QQ is a conversion.

```
sage: R = RealField(2)
sage: R.coerce_map_from(QQ)

The behaviour that you see is by design, so by definition it's a feature and not a bug.

Note also that what you see is consistent with subtraction, which is a good thing:

```
sage: RealField(2)(1) - 5/4
0.00
```

I don't see a simple fix here... it would require substantial changes to the coercion model.

why no simply forbid comparison involving floating-point numbers, if it can result in mathematically wrong results? Then the user would have to do:

```
sage: RealField(2)(7).exact_rational() == 10
False
```

I don't think that's realistic. I'm pretty sure that a lot of stuff in Sage would break if we did that.

I don't quite see it as a mathematically wrong result as it is correct up to the estimate bounds. If we did that, then I feel this would have to return `False` by the same argument:

```
sage: bool(pi.n() == pi)
True
```
since `pi.n()` is an inexact floating point number. Also, we have this doctest in `exact_rational`:

```
sage: RR(3^60).exact_rational() - 3^60
6125652559

it would indeed be correct to return False, since `pi.n()` is a well-defined rational number, namely `884279719003555/2^48`, and it is well known that `pi` is not rational, thus we cannot get equality.

Anyway, since I'm alone to consider this as a bug, I will simply use `exact_rational` whenever I want correct comparisons with floating-point numbers.
