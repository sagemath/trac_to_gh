cython (cdef) function `initialize()` fails in `src/sage/libs/gap/util.pyx` with `TypeError: expected bytes, str found`.

This can be traced to the lines

```
    from sage.interfaces.gap import _get_gap_memory_pool_size_MB
    memory_pool = _get_gap_memory_pool_size_MB()
    argv[3] = "-o"
    argv[4] = memory_pool
```
which get a string `memory_pool` from Python and try to assign it to `argv[4]` of C type `char*`. This is something that needs extra care on Python3, as `memory_pool` is of type `str`.

I get past `initialization()`, and can do things like
`libgap.eval("blah")`, but get a segfault on `libgap(1)` (but not on `libgap("1")`).

It seems to happen at
`return libGAP_IS_FUNC(self.value)`, line 1024 of `sage/libs/gap/element.pyx`.
