I first noted this in #24389 but wasn't exactly sure at the time what the problem was.  Now I've seen this same problem again with pytz and have investigated more.

It seems at some point, some Python source package creation tool (I'm not sure which) has started creating some apparently bogus (but still readable) tar files.  This was not previously the case.  For example, `entrypoints-0.2.2.tar.gz` looks normal:

```

Most notably, it does not contain explicit entries for the directories.  This strikes me as fishy, but I don't think it's actually incorrect as far as the tar format is concerned.  It's still unusual though, and different from what GNU tar would do.

What's worse, however, is that the `tarfile` module is buggy in how it handles such files.  When an *explicit* directory entry exists, it uses the method `TarFile.makedir` which creates the directory with "safe" permissions (`0o700`), and then later applies the requested permissions and ownership to the directory (our tarfile wrapper ensures that the user's umask is applied in this case).

*However*, if there are no explicit entries for the directories a file is in, when it goes to try to extract that file it happily calls `os.makedirs` for the file's entire directory tree, using the default mode, and never applies any fixups to the directories.  If the default permissions are too permissive this can cause builds to break.

In fairness the behavior of `tarfile` might not be a bug, insofar as if there are no directory entries in the tarfile then it has no way of knowing what permissions/ownership to apply to the directories, so it just takes the user's current defaults.

That's still a bit sketchy though, and I want to find out what tool is making these strange tarballs...

It does for Python packages that import the package itself during setup--then your patch to Python complains that the permissions are not restrictive enough and refuses to add `''` to `sys.path`, preventing this from working.  I have mixed feelings about that, but it is an example where the permissions do affect installation and is not a bug.

Speaking of extracting tarballs: just today I encountered again an issue with `pip` which comes up now and then: if `pip` installs something, the timestamp of the installed file is taken from the *source* file. With autotools on the other hand, the timestamp of the installed files equals the *installation time*.

The autotools behaviour makes a lot more sense because of dependency checking: if you (re)install a package, you typically want to rebuild everything depending on that package. A typical example of breakage is Cython packages which depend on other Cython packages. There is also a workaround for this issue at the end of `build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-install`

So it might be a good idea to just update the timestamp of the files in the extracted tarball to the current time.

Well, over in #20481 we agreed that applying the user's umask to the files was the most "correct" approach, but as this issue demonstrates, there are cases where if the user's umask has certain values the build will simply fail even if it were otherwise correctly applied to all the directories.

So in that case, simply for the purpose of building Sage's packages, it probably makes sense to just force a mask like `077` and leave it at that.  Agreed on the timestamps as well; I need to double-check what Python's `TarFile` does by default there.

Hopefully there are no packages that somehow depend on files in the source tarball having a certain timestamp... That would be ugly.

Tarballs should preserve timestamps by default.

The problem is really in distutils: when it copies files, it always preserves the timestamp. Ideally, we should fix this in distutils too. Should we report this to https://bugs.python.org/ or some different bug tracker?

But changing the timestamp of the extracted tarballs would fix all cases, even for non-Python packages (even though I don't know any with this bug).
