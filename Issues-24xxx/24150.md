Write a method for the `IntegralLattice` class for generating the root lattices A<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>, Euclidian lattice, U with standard basis.

Example:

```
IntegralLattice(["A",3])
IntegralLattice("U")
IntegralLattice(4)
```

<a id='comment:18'></a>I got rid of the input `IntegralLattice("A",3)` because you made the code unnecessarily complicated by supporting that, where it is more natural for the input to be something that is recognizable by `CartanType`/`CartanMatrix`/etc. Moreover, the code previously had a bug:

```
sage: H5 = Matrix(ZZ, 2, [2,1,1,-2])
sage: IntegralLattice(H5, Matrix([1,1]))
Lattice of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
Inner product matrix:
[ 2  1]
[ 1 -2]
sage: IntegralLattice(H5, basis=Matrix([1,1]))
Lattice of degree 2 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Basis matrix:
[1 1]
Inner product matrix:
[ 2  1]
[ 1 -2]
```
whereas you claimed in the doc that they were the same. So if my changes look good (and this example is now correct and valid), then positive review.
