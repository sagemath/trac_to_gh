Of course not. You are breaking a part of Sage that used to work!

Really, why do we need to get rid of this `__long__` anyway? It doesn't hurt to keep it on Python 3. The doctests won't work because there is no `long`, but the tests should work with `int` on Python 3.

It's a general thing that I have said on several other tickets: if you break an existing doctest for Python 3 porting, there should be an exceptional reason for it. Generally, you change the code such that the code works on Python 2 and Python 3 but you keep the doctests.

Of course, if the doctest itself is not compatible with Python 3 (in this cases, it uses `long()`), then it can't work on Python 3. But it should still work on Python 2.

Well, because keeping long(..) is not an option if we want doctests to pass, that's why.

But I more concerned with the call to long in

```
src/sage/interfaces/interface.py: return long(randstate().seed()&0x1FFFFFFF)
```
that prevents some combinat code to run.

By the way, did you try to build and use sage with python3 yourself ?
