Of course not. You are breaking a part of Sage that used to work!

Really, why do we need to get rid of this `__long__` anyway? It doesn't hurt to keep it on Python 3. The doctests won't work because there is no `long`, but the tests should work with `int` on Python 3.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Well, because keeping long(..) is not an option if we want doctests to pass, that's why.

But I more concerned with the call to long in

```
src/sage/interfaces/interface.py: return long(randstate().seed()&0x1FFFFFFF)
```
that prevents some combinat code to run.

By the way, did you try to build and use sage with python3 yourself ?
