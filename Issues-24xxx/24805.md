Previously we used an opcode named 'div' both for the old `div` operator
and for `truediv` (for compatibility's sake, since use of `__truediv__`) depends
on whether or not `from `__future__` import division` is in effect).

So again, for compatibility's sake, on Python 3 we call truediv just 'div',
while integer division is still explicitly 'floordiv'.

Includes a few other semi-related fixes found while testing.  This fixes most but not all Python 3 issues with `sage.ext.fast_callable`--at least those directly related to division.

I agree it's probably not a very likely scenario, but I did it anyways.

Yep, did that.

The way it's written now, it looks like the deprecation warning will be shown every time that `__truediv__` fails with a `TypeError`, regardless of whether `__div__` works.

Maybe better something like:

```
try:
    ...
except TypeError:
    IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION < 3:
        res = PyNumber_Divide(...)
        deprecation(...)
        return res
    ELSE
        raise
    ENDIF
```
This way, the deprecation will only be shown if `__div__` actually worked.

I am getting consistent doctest timeouts on a particular test system:

```
sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/geometry/riemannian_manifolds/surface3d_generators.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_lattice.py  # Timed out
```
I'll need to check whether this ticket has something to do with that.
