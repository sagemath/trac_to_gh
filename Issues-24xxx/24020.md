A few tests have started failing on Cygwin, mostly since I had to take the Cygwin patchbot down:

* `sage.env._add_variable_or_fallback` since #23758

```
File "src/sage/env.py", line 75, in sage.env._add_variable_or_fallback
Failed example:
    sage.env.SAGE_ENV['TEMP']
Expected:
    '---foo---'
Got:
    '/tmp'
```
* `sage.misc.functional.log` since #19444 (due to a minor numerical difference I've observed before in `log(3.0)`).

```
File "src/sage/misc/functional.py", line 986, in sage.misc.functional.log
Failed example:
    log(float(3))
Expected:
    1.0986122886681098
Got:
    1.0986122886681096
```
* `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._eval_self` (I'm not sure but I'm guessing this is due to #23820 and thus small changes in pynac which could still be sensitive to small stdlib math implementation differences)

```
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 1183, in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._eval_self
Failed example:
    float(cos(I))
Expected:
    1.5430806348152437
Got:
    1.543080634815244
```

I will probably try to tackle these all at once since they all seem to be pretty small issues just in the tests, but if any become more significant I'll create a separate ticket.
