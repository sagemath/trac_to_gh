<a id='comment:3'></a>You could do:

```
+    if continental:
+        G = G.subgraph(G.connected_component_containing_vertex('France'))
+        G.name(new="Continental Europe Map")
+    else:
+        G.add_vertices(no_land_border)
+        G.name(new="Europe Map")
```
Instead of France, you can of course choose another country ;)
The most important is to be independent of the order in which connected components are returned.
