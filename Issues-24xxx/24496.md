Unfortunately `center()` of Europe is quite large.

You could do:

```
+    if continental:
+        G = G.subgraph(G.connected_component_containing_vertex('France'))
+        G.name(new="Continental Europe Map")
+    else:
+        G.add_vertices(no_land_border)
+        G.name(new="Europe Map")
```
Instead of France, you can of course choose another country ;)
The most important is to be independent of the order in which connected components are returned.

As you wish. Actually "The list is ordered from largest to smallest component.", says documentation of `connected_components`, but it is not explicitly said in `connected_components_subgraphs`.

I select Austria as "central point". At least it will survive climate change and raising sea level...
