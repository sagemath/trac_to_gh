Here are two matrix groups over a finite ring which compare as unequal, despite having the same elements:

```
sage: gens1 = ([52,0,0,103],[104,0,0,104],[1,1,0,1])
sage: gens2 = ([52, 0, 0, 103],[59,0,0,89],[104,0,0,104],[1,1,0,1])
sage: H1 = MatrixGroup(list(matrix(Zmod(105), 2,2, u) for u in gens1))
sage: H2 = MatrixGroup(list(matrix(Zmod(105), 2,2, u) for u in gens2))
sage: H1 == H2
False
sage: sorted(list(x.matrix() for x in H1)) == sorted(list(x.matrix() for x in H2))
True
```

(This was originally discovered because it was getting called from the equality-testing code of GammaH groups. This is no longer the case, but the underlying bug remains.)

**Status:** new

It fails in the current stable release (8.0) but I can confirm that it also works for me with 8.1.rc2.

Looking at the git log, it seems that this got fixed as a side-effect of one of your commits, b0f1552f8e07d80c529f349fa3ce2898636d65f4 (there is no trac ticket number in the commit message, but the message says something about Python3 and cmp).

There is still some shadow of the bug left in 8.1.rc2, but it is much harder to expose:

```
sage: G1 = GammaH(105, [52, 104])
sage: G2 = GammaH(105, kronecker_character_upside_down(105).kernel())
sage: G1.image_mod_n() == G2.image_mod_n()
False
```

I agree with David that this is *not* an isomorphism check. It is a check of having the same elements. Two matrix groups can be isomorphic but not equal (say, they are both cyclic groups of the same order but containing different matrices).

Right, this is a pure equality check. Sorry.

Here is another annoying bug.
It may or may not be related to this ticket.

```
sage: G = GL(2,5)
sage: g = G( matrix([[1,0],[0,4]]))
sage: H = G.subgroup([g])
sage: g in H
False
```
In any case, it makes me dream of going back to magma.
