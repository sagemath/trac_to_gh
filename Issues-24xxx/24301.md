Here are two matrix groups over a finite ring which compare as unequal, despite having the same elements:

```
sage: gens1 = ([52,0,0,103],[104,0,0,104],[1,1,0,1])
sage: gens2 = ([52, 0, 0, 103],[59,0,0,89],[104,0,0,104],[1,1,0,1])
sage: H1 = MatrixGroup(list(matrix(Zmod(105), 2,2, u) for u in gens1))
sage: H2 = MatrixGroup(list(matrix(Zmod(105), 2,2, u) for u in gens2))
sage: H1 == H2
False
sage: sorted(list(x.matrix() for x in H1)) == sorted(list(x.matrix() for x in H2))
True
```

(This was originally discovered because it was getting called from the equality-testing code of GammaH groups. This is no longer the case, but the underlying bug remains.)

It fails in the current stable release (8.0) but I can confirm that it also works for me with 8.1.rc2.

Looking at the git log, it seems that this got fixed as a side-effect of one of your commits, b0f1552f8e07d80c529f349fa3ce2898636d65f4 (there is no trac ticket number in the commit message, but the message says something about Python3 and cmp).

There is still some shadow of the bug left in 8.1.rc2, but it is much harder to expose:

```
sage: G1 = GammaH(105, [52, 104])
sage: G2 = GammaH(105, kronecker_character_upside_down(105).kernel())
sage: G1.image_mod_n() == G2.image_mod_n()
False
```

I claim there is one and only one sensible way to define what it means for two subgroups of the same group to be \"equal\".\n\nNo, there is not. What I think you are asking for is secretly a check for isomorphism and taking advantage of the extra structure, but this can still be *very* expensive to compute. Imagine the subgroups are big, testing all elements are the same means iterating over the subgroups (which in general means also storing all of the elements) and then comparing equality of each of the set of elements (rather than by looking at sorted lits).\n\nI find that I am usually constructing algebraic objects, such as groups, where it is sufficient to check the generating set. There has been other points in Sage where Python `==` versus math `=` differs and causes confusion, but there could be some major speed regressions with changing the comparison code to be closer to math `=`.\n\nI understand why you disagree with `==` returning false, but IMO it is not practical to have a test that is basically isomorphism testing. However, you are free to ask about this on sage-devel and if there is a consensus for changing this, then I will do the review.

No, there is not. What I think you are asking for is secretly a check for isomorphism and taking advantage of the extra structure, but this can still be *very* expensive to compute. Imagine the subgroups are big, testing all elements are the same means iterating over the subgroups (which in general means also storing all of the elements) and then comparing equality of each of the set of elements (rather than by looking at sorted lits).

I find that I am usually constructing algebraic objects, such as groups, where it is sufficient to check the generating set.

Here is another annoying bug.
It may or may not be related to this ticket.

```
sage: G = GL(2,5)
sage: g = G( matrix([[1,0],[0,4]]))
sage: H = G.subgroup([g])
sage: g in H
False
```
In any case, it makes me dream of going back to magma.
