The [different ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Different_ideal) is something standard (and useful to study ramifications in the ring of integers). What is the different of an element useful for? What would be the usage of these functions?

Concerning the code:

1. It is a very bad idea to introduce a method that is not working (here `different`). The reason is that such method appear when you do tab-completion and provokes more confusion than anything else. Just don't implement it.

2. It would be much simpler to have only one method called `different` which accept a `base_field` argument so that
   - `a.different()` would always be relative to the base field
   - `a.different(base_field=QQ)` would be relative to `QQ`
   I also don't see why you should not allow `base_fied` to be any subfield.

3. As written in [developer guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content) the documentation of a function should start with a **one line** description. An optional paragraph can follow.

4. In the documentation, you should say precisely what is `a` and what is `f`.

The different of an element comes up for me every once in a while. Usually I want to see if the different of an element generates the different ideal. So having a `.different()` method makes that a tad easier.

I attempted to incorporate the comments into Caleb's code.

There is now one `.different()` method which takes an optional parameter of `base_field`, which can either be a subfield or an embedding.

Replying to [cremona](#comment%3A5):

Consistency is hard. The following are methods on `class NumberFieldElement(FieldElement)`:

```
def trace(self, K=None): ...
def norm(self, K=None): ...
def absolute_norm(self): ...
def relative_norm(self): ...
def charpoly(self, var='x'): ...
def minpoly(self, var='x'): ...
def matrix(self, base=None): ...
```

Both absolute and relative number field elements also implement

```
def absolute_charpoly(...)
def absolute_minpoly(...)
```

There is no `relative_charpoly` or `relative_minpoly` as far as I can tell.
None of these methods seem to be restricted like `discriminant` is for relative number fields.

Pretty much all of these methods just call `self.matrix`, with the exception that sometimes there is an optional argument to use Pari.

I thought the most consistent thing would be to make `different` and `absolute_different` like it is for charpoly and minpoly.
Though I would want `different` to be more similar to `trace` or `norm`.

I also realized `self.matrix` was doing all the same logic I was trying to do, so that means the implementation is now just two lines now.

Some suggestions based on our documentation guidelines
- prefer imperative "Return" to descriptive "Returns"
- use `::` before each example code block
- pep8: spaces after commas and around `+` and `-`
- add cross-links with `.. SEEALSO::`

```diff
-    def different(self,K=None):
+    def different(self, K=None):
         r"""
-        Returns the different of the element ``self`` with respect to the given
-        base field ``K``, which defaults ``self.parent().base_field()``.
+        Return the different of this element with respect to the given
+        base field.

         The different of an element `a` in an extension of number fields `L/K`
         is defined as `\mathrm{Diff}_{L/K}(a) = f'(a)` where `f` is the
         characteristic polynomial of `a` over `K`.

         INPUT:

         - ``K`` -- a subfield (embedding of a subfield) of the parent
-        number field ``K`` of ``self``. The default is ``K.base_field()``.
+          number field of ``self``. Default: ``None``, which will amount
+          to ``self.parent().base_field()``.

         EXAMPLES::

-            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2)
+            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
             sage: a.different()
             3*a^2
             sage: a.different(K=K)
             1

-        The optional argument ``K`` can be an embedding of a subfield
-        as shown here.
+        The optional argument ``K`` can be an embedding of a subfield::
 
             sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^4 - 2)
             sage: (b^2).different()
             0
             sage: phi = K.base_field().embeddings(K)[0]
             sage: b.different(K=phi)
             4*b^3

-        Here we compute the relative and absolute different of an element
-        in a relative number field.
+        Compare the relative different and the absolute different
+        for an element in a relative number field::

             sage: K.<a> = NumberFieldTower([x^2 - 17, x^3 - 2])
             sage: a.different()
             2*a0
             sage: a.different(K=QQ)
             0
             sage: a.absolute_different()
             0

-        In this example, we can see that the different of the extension `\QQ(i)/\QQ`
-        is generated by the different of `i`.
+        Observe that for the field extension `\QQ(i)/\QQ`, the different of
+        the field extension is the ideal generated by the different of `i`::

-            sage: K.<c> = NumberField(x^2+1)
+            sage: K.<c> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
             sage: K.different() == K.ideal(c.different())
