In #23160 I added an initial library of helper functions for use in `spkg-build/install`. Those functions are defined and documented in `build/bin/sage-dist-helpers`, and now also documented in the developer's guide (#28721).

I'm experimenting now with a Sphinx directive to read function documentation from the shell script.  Will update once I have something working.


Component: **documentation**
