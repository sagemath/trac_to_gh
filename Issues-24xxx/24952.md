Before:

```
sage: a = ZZ(23)
sage: %timeit SR(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.51 µs per loop
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 218 ns per loop
```
Profiling with callgrind shows Python code the main contributor (only 0.4% Pynac), with a big chunk from malloc/free.

* simply moving up the check for `Integer` in `SR._element_constructor_()` reduces the time to 300ns 
* with a mock `Integer._symbolic_()` member replacing `if (hasattr(x, '_symbolic_')):` with `try: x._symbolic_()` gains 100ns

So this ticket will implement a dedicated `Integer._symbolic_()` that calls helper functions in `symbolic/expression.pyx`. 

Result:

```
sage: %timeit _=SR(a)
The slowest run took 32.27 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 399 ns per loop
```
With rational the change is from 4.4µs to 0.6µs.

In pure Python, it is 2-3x faster to check `hasattr` when such an attribute is not there, but having the attribute is slower, but not by so much:

```sage
sage: def check(x):
....:     if hasattr(x,'parent'):
....:         return x.parent()
....:     return None
sage: def check2(x):
....:     try:
....:         return x.parent()
....:     except AttributeError:
....:         return None
sage: z = 5
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 205 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 126 ns per loop
sage: z = int(5)
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 381 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 889 ns per loop
```
Similar using Cython:

```sage
sage: %%cython
....: def check(x):
....:     if hasattr(x,'parent'):
....:         return x.parent()
....: def check2(x):
....:     try:
....:         return x.parent()
....:     except AttributeError:
....:         return None
....: 
sage: z = 5
sage: %timeit check(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 94 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 68.5 ns per loop
sage: z = int(5)
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 185 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 395 ns per loop
```
So I am not convinced that removing the `hasattr` check is for the better. I guess the question is how often do you expect things to be passed to `SR` that do not have a `_symbolic_`? What about also doing `SR(Rational)`?
