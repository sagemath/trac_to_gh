I looked in the sources and it's pretty simple where this warning comes from: lcalc wants to use PARI with a hardcoded stack size of 1 GB. PARI tries to allocate this memory (using `mmap`) and this allocation fails. It then halves the stack size (printing the warning) until it succeeds with 1/4 GB. Since there are no further failures, apparently that stack size is sufficient.

Now *why* this happens on your Cygwin patchbot is an entirely different question.
