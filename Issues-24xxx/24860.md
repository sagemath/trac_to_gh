This is similar to #24192. On my Cygwin brial actually builds fine with `-std=c++11`, but one person [reported a problem with this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/iMN3N7pqrq8/xNuNOWZfCgAJ), and that using `-std=gnu+11` fixed it.

I did some digging and it seems this affects Cygwin installs newer than mine, so we should definitely get this fixed then.
