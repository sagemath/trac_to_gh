Instead of

elif op == Py_GT or op == Py_GE or op == Py_LT or op == Py_LE:
```
you can use `else` (and not import `Py_GT`, `Py_GE`, `Py_LT`, `Py_LE`)

Good catch. The explanation is simply that this ticket is older than #24627.

Yes, but I prefer the current version. (Is there any guarantee that Python won't add more comparison operators, btw?)

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A6):
> You would better test `+`, `-`, ...rather than `_add_`, `_sub_`, ...

Why? What I want in this case in really to test the implementation for this specific parent, not the dispatch done by the coercion framework.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A7):
> (BTW, why `__invert__(self)` (two underscores, standard Python) and `_neg_(self)` (where does it come from!?))

`Element` implements `__neg__()` and not `__invert__()`, probably because abusing `__invert__()` to mean `1/x` like most Sage `Element`s do may not be such a good idea. But I don't think there is any reason to implement `_neg_()` rather than `__neg__()` in the present case, and the latter should be slightly faster.
