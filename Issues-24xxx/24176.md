In order to be able to express solution sets from SymPy's `solveset` a set comprehension constructor as equivalent to SymPy's `imageset` / `ConditionSet` is needed. As the arguments are symbolic the most natural way to do this would be a formal symbolic function named like `set_of_all` taking a term argument and a list argument containing `element_of(...)` function expressions.

This set would convert to a `SymPy` [ImageSet](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/sets.html#sympy.sets.fancysets.ImageSet) or [ConditionSet](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/sets.html#conditionset)

<a id='comment:14'></a>I think the approach on the current branch may be tied a bit too closely to `SR` functions.

I think it's better to first implement:

- `ImageSubset` (as an abstract subobject of the codomain) for arbitrary `Map`s -- this would be a generalization of `ImageManifoldSubset` (#31653). No relation to `SR` (but by relaxing the code from #24171 that only allows some sets to be coerced to `SR`, one would be able to coerce it to `SR`).

- `ConditionSet` (as an abstract subobject of a parent in the `Sets` category) - defined via the element constructor of the parent and an `SR` expression with truth value.
