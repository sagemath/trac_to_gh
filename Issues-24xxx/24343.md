This won't be "ready for review" I think until some of its dependencies are dealt with first, but in the meantime if you want to try using these fixes it should prove helpful.

The distinction is mainly whether the commits are logically/functionally independent or not. If you have a first commit which is broken and then commit 2 and commit 3 to fix issues with the first commit, it makes no sense to review by commit.

But I don't know how you then find time for much else.  I'm a strong proponent of careful code review, but sometimes you also have to pick your battles, or trust other people to review things.  I used to review every single line change to Astropy when we started the project, but as it grew there was no way I could keep up, especially as large modules grew in which different people had more expertise, and I learned to trust them to do their best in terms of quality assurance.  I still give most changes a glance over in case there are *specific* issues I'm concerned about.\n\nAnyways, you do what you want, and believe it or not I try my best to keep my changes reasonably atomic and logical (though this becomes difficult when making mass sets of minor fixes).  And I'll do what I can to make things easier.  I just wish I understood your process better and why you find it helpful to review a whole branch versus individual commits.\n\nTo me, looking over the full merge commit is obviously the first pass, and if there are individual changes I have more questions about I'll often drill more into the history of that file to find the individual commit where that change was made.\n\nI agree this becomes more difficult if there are lots of commits combined that affect multiple files simultaneously.  I wouldn't often combine changes like that into a single ticket (hence why I broke up #24740 and #24741, and considered actually breaking the latter into two more tickets).  In this case, however, all the changes are fairly small an localized.",

And I appreciate that, because your scrutiny promotes a high level of quality.  But I don't know how you then find time for much else.  I'm a strong proponent of careful code review, but sometimes you also have to pick your battles, or trust other people to review things.  I used to review every single line change to Astropy when we started the project, but as it grew there was no way I could keep up, especially as large modules grew in which different people had more expertise, and I learned to trust them to do their best in terms of quality assurance.  I still give most changes a glance over in case there are *specific* issues I'm concerned about.

Anyways, you do what you want, and believe it or not I try my best to keep my changes reasonably atomic and logical (though this becomes difficult when making mass sets of minor fixes).  And I'll do what I can to make things easier.  I just wish I understood your process better and why you find it helpful to review a whole branch versus individual commits.

To me, looking over the full merge commit is obviously the first pass, and if there are individual changes I have more questions about I'll often drill more into the history of that file to find the individual commit where that change was made.

I agree this becomes more difficult if there are lots of commits combined that affect multiple files simultaneously.  I wouldn't often combine changes like that into a single ticket (hence why I broke up #24740 and #24741, and considered actually breaking the latter into two more tickets).  In this case, however, all the changes are fairly small an localized.

To put things more constructively, if you can give me some idea how you prefer to see changes logically split into individual tickets, I can certainly keep that in mind in the future.

It's just that for the Python 3 fixes there are so many thousands of little changes, I thought it would be simplest (and least likely to produce conflicts) to group together large sets of small fixes by package, or in some cases by individual module.

Obviously if I require some more substantive change (such as new features) I can, and have, made separate tickets for that.  Beyond that I'm not really sure.

> To put things more constructively, if you can give me some idea how you prefer to see changes logically split into individual tickets, I can certainly keep that in mind in the future.

Broadly speaking, there are 3 level of changes:

1. Small isolated changes and basic clean-up, e.g. adding `str/bytes` conversion, using `with(open())`, fixing imports, style changes.

2. Non-trivial changes which do not change user-visible functionality, i.e. refactoring.

3. Changes to user-visible functionality.

For me, a ticket should ideally work on precisely one of these levels. Level 1 changes can be mostly approved on sight. If a ticket consists of 80% level 1 changes and 20% level 2 changes, then it can be hard to understand the level 2 changes because the many level 1 changes are just distracting the diff.

> large sets of small fixes

IMHO, this ticket contains several non-small (level 2 in my above classification) changes.

I didn't mean to delete it, and there was at least one good reason for it which is that deleting attributes off objects is just ugly when you can set them to None instead.

I'm reworking some of this code elsewhere so I'm not going to worry about it though.

I guess you mean this sentence from the commit message:
> Note that `DocTestWorker.kill()` now calls `sage_results_output` [sic], which ensures that the `DocTestWorker.outtmpfile` is closed.

Why not simply call `self.outtmpfile.close()` in `kill`?

Even if the file is already closed, Python allows closing an already-closed file:

I think some of the stuff I ended up removing from this was needed after all.  It might not have shown up either because:

a) I was originally testing with a debug build of Python which always displays `ResourceWarning`s by default (a non-debug build does not)

b) Some of it might have been particular to Cygwin, but I switched mostly to testing on Linux later on.
