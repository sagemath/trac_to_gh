This won't be "ready for review" I think until some of its dependencies are dealt with first, but in the meantime if you want to try using these fixes it should prove helpful.

To put things more constructively, if you can give me some idea how you prefer to see changes logically split into individual tickets, I can certainly keep that in mind in the future.

It's just that for the Python 3 fixes there are so many thousands of little changes, I thought it would be simplest (and least likely to produce conflicts) to group together large sets of small fixes by package, or in some cases by individual module.

Obviously if I require some more substantive change (such as new features) I can, and have, made separate tickets for that.  Beyond that I'm not really sure.

Broadly speaking, there are 3 level of changes:

1. Small isolated changes and basic clean-up, e.g. adding `str/bytes` conversion, using `with(open())`, fixing imports, style changes.

2. Non-trivial changes which do not change user-visible functionality, i.e. refactoring.

3. Changes to user-visible functionality.

For me, a ticket should ideally work on precisely one of these levels. Level 1 changes can be mostly approved on sight. If a ticket consists of 80% level 1 changes and 20% level 2 changes, then it can be hard to understand the level 2 changes because the many level 1 changes are just distracting the diff.

> large sets of small fixes


IMHO, this ticket contains several non-small (level 2 in my above classification) changes.

Just took Jeroen's branch and rebased on top of #24772.

This added call to `save_result_output` is causing breakage:

```diff
+        # Save any result output so far before we kill the process off
+        self.save_result_output()
```

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/forker.py

```
Now I see that you needed [comment:29] to fix that breakage but why did you need to add a call to `save_result_output` in `kill()`? All doctests pass when I remove that.

I guess you mean this sentence from the commit message:
> Note that `DocTestWorker.kill()` now calls `sage_results_output` [sic], which ensures that the `DocTestWorker.outtmpfile` is closed.


Why not simply call `self.outtmpfile.close()` in `kill`?

Even if the file is already closed, Python allows closing an already-closed file:

```
>>> f = open("/dev/null")
>>> f.close()
>>> f.close()

OK, that seems good on first sight. The last commit (changing the `sleep()` time) is probably no longer needed. I guess you added it because `kill()` did more stuff and needed more time.

And let me just think whether the change of `open()` mode from `"a"` to `"w"` could cause trouble...

a) I was originally testing with a debug build of Python which always displays `ResourceWarning`s by default (a non-debug build does not)

b) Some of it might have been particular to Cygwin, but I switched mostly to testing on Linux later on.
