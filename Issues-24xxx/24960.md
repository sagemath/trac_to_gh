The prime_pi function sometimes computes a wrong result. In particular, I found the following errors:

* prime_pi(14783545363230719)
  returns 408351706116074, it should be 408351706116078
* prime_pi(5685979153167559)
  returns 161319877461134, it should be 161319877461136
* prime_pi(642763101936913)
  returns 19439675999018, it should be 19439675999019

The correct countings are computed using Kim Walisch's [primecount](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/) library, with different algorithms: Deleglise-Rivat, Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko and Lehmer's formula. All of them return the same result.

Note that while the arguments to prime_pi in the first two examples exceed the value 2!^50, causing the appearance of a warning ("computation of prime_pi for x >= 2!^50 has not been as thoroughly tested as for smaller values"), the argument  of the last example is within the range of inputs considered to be safe.

Actually, instead of fixing the current code, it could be easier to rewrite the prime_pi function and let it use the primecount library. This would have the additional advantage of being much faster than the current code. The table below compares the execution times (in seconds) of primecount with Deleglise-Rivat, primecount with Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko and [SageMath](SageMath) prime_pi function.

All results have been obtained with an Intel i5-2500K. For primecount, a single thread has been used.

Here we take the route of replacing Cython code in `sage.functions.prime_pi`
with calls to functions in `sage.interface.primecount`

Will be fixed by #32894

Is the cmake dependency really a no-go for making it standard?

Yes, either the current cython code should become a pip-installable package; or switch to using https://pypi.org/project/primecount/ (but see https://github.com/hearot/primecount-python/issues/3).

The pip-installable package can then become an SPKG.

I finally built and tested this on a 32-bit host, the only one test error there, it is due to a different error message, `int is too big` vs `Python int is too big`.

Needs some dots to be added.

You were asking how to do dependencies right. The answer is: The bindings need to go into a separate Python package -- that will look just like `memory_allocator`. In this way, `sagelib` will not acquire another compile-time dependency. Modularization = do not pile on additional compile-time dependencies.

I asked you whether it's the only Cython file out there left that should not be a part of sagelib.
You didn't reply - I assume this means it is not. 

I don't have mental capacity now to learn the ideal modern design, I just want this ticket done in the most direct way.
Modularisation can be done on another ticket.

I was relieved today from teaching computer graphics next term, so I have some spare mental capacity now :-)

Note that `src/sage/functions/prime_pi.pyx` relies heavily on `sagelib` (e.g. on SR). 

What does not rely on sagelib (or on Sage at all) is  `src/sage/interfaces/primecount.pyx`, 
which is not even touched by this ticket (it's touched by  #25009).
 
The latter indeed can be spun off, modelling on `memory_allocator`
(I suppose after it's done, one would only need to change one import statement in `src/sage/functions/prime_pi.pyx`.)
