Tried, got an error as not it is only imported to command line, not to "internal" use.

Could you do the following changes:
- `Test whether the graph is cograph.` -> `Check whether the graph is cograph.`  It seems more commonly used. Well, I never remember which is the recommended term
- Add in the description of what is a cograph something like: "A cograph has no induced `P_4`." Then the reader will easy get the relation between the documentation and the code.

There should be a skeleton for Boolean-valued functions. I asked about that in sage-devel, but IIRC there was no clear response.

Some typos in the text:
- `subgraphh` -> `subgraph`
- `splittin to` -> `split it into`

last, you could add a todo block like (at least its here if you prefer not to add it):

```
.. TODO::

    Implement faster recognition algorithm, as for instance
    the linear time recognition algorithm using LexBFS proposed
    in [BCH08]_.
```

and add the ref where it should.
