sage: gcd([1/1,1/2])
1
sage: gcd([1/2,1/1])
1/2
```
Though the gcd is perfectly well defined on rationals

```
sage: (1/1).gcd(1/2)
1/2
sage: (1/2).gcd(1/1)
1/2
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>It's because the loop through the sequence is interrupted as soon as the partial GCD is one, which is only valid for integer GCD:

```
    for vi in v:
        g = vi.gcd(g, **kwargs)
        if g == one:
            return g
