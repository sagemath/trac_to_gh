Following [my comments](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24575#comment:50) on #24575 I think it might be useful to have a generic helper function for implementing my workaround there.

For now it is Linux-only since we've only explicitly encountered this problem on Linux.  I believe `LD_PRELOAD` *may* be supported on newer versions of Cygwin, but I haven't specifically encountered the need for this workaround there.  It would also have to work a bit differently on OSX (which uses `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` for this purpose).  Again, the need hasn't been specifically encountered on that platform.  I'm not sure about other unices either.

The best fix of all for this, from a Sage perspective, is not build and install our own libgc at all if it isn't needed :)
