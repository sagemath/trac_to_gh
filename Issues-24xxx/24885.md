Following [ticket:24575#comment:50 my comments] on #24575 I think it might be useful to have a generic helper function for implementing my workaround there.

For now it is Linux-only since we've only explicitly encountered this problem on Linux.  I believe `LD_PRELOAD` *may* be supported on newer versions of Cygwin, but I haven't specifically encountered the need for this workaround there.  It would also have to work a bit differently on OSX (which uses `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` for this purpose).  Again, the need hasn't been specifically encountered on that platform.  I'm not sure about other unices either.

This might be a necessary clutch to get something working, but it is also always a bug in the package build system. We should be working with upstream to point out the issue and fix their build system, not add a framework to Sage so we can ignore those bugs...

I agree it's ugly, but I don't agree particularly agree that it's an upstream bug.  I can think of other cases where having something like this might be useful as well.

The best fix of all for this, from a Sage perspective, is not build and install our own libgc at all if it isn't needed :)
