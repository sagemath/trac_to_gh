GLPK 4.65 was released recently and it prints the warning "Long-step dual simplex will be used" all over the place, leading to many failing sagemath doctests in Debian (they fixed it by backporting
an upstream patch)

We backport the corresponding patch to GLPK 4.65.
Having this in will have the tack of #28459 easier.

Reminds me of #20876.

I have no idea what the message "Long-step dual simplex will be used" means. Is it supposed to be a warning?

It's this change in src/draft/glpios03.c:

```
+ #if 0 /* 20/I-2018 */
           xprintf("WARNING: LONG-STEP DUAL SIMPLEX WILL BE USED\n");
+ #else
+          xprintf("Long-step dual simplex will be used\n");
+ #endif
```

So it seems that just the text of the message was changed. Does the content of the message influence whether it's printed?

It's not our goal to completely disable terminal output. We still want to see error messages for example.

It's one thing to ask to unconditionlly change the default mode of operation, and quite another to ask to accept a patch for a possibility to manipulate the default mode.

Asking to apply the same patch again would be not welcome, I think, and might lessen our chances to get what I propose in.

Could you ask a question whether they'd welcome such a patch, before we spend time working on it?
