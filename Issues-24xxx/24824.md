GLPK 4.65 was released recently and it prints the warning "Long-step dual simplex will be used" all over the place, leading to many failing sagemath doctests in Debian (they fixed it by backporting
an upstream patch)

We backport the corresponding patch to GLPK 4.65.
Having this in will have the tack of #28459 easier.

Reminds me of #20876.

I have no idea what the message "Long-step dual simplex will be used" means. Is it supposed to be a warning?

It's not our goal to completely disable terminal output. We still want to see error messages for example.

It's one thing to ask to unconditionlly change the default mode of operation, and quite another to ask to accept a patch for a possibility to manipulate the default mode.

Asking to apply the same patch again would be not welcome, I think, and might lessen our chances to get what I propose in.

I'm seeing the message "Long-step dual simplex will be used" using a system installation of glpk, thereby causing lots of failed tests. Is there anything to be done about this? Refuse to use the system installation if it's version 4.65? Block the message somehow?

For GLPK 4.65, some package distributions ship a patched version
that removes these "Long-step dual simplex will be used" messages,
but some don't. Ideally when deciding whether to install GLPK or use
the system one, our install scripts should take that into account.

Couldn't we just run something that would print the warnings and check if the warnings are printed?
