The current `sage.rings.real_mpfr` deals with arbitrary precision floating-point numbers (using mpfr). This is the default "real field" in many places in Sage even though it is often wiser to use intervals or balls. We perform some cosmetic changes to `sage.rings.real_mpfr` to emphasize the fact that the module deals with floating-point approximations of real numbers and not genuine reals. These modifications touch a lot of files and involve deprecation of widely used names.

See also the introduction of a genuine real field class in #24456 for another motivation.

## step 1

- #24511: move the class factory `create_RealField` in `real_field.py`
- #24523: change string representation
- #24524:
   - `RealField` -> `RealFloatingPointField_factory`
   - `RealField_class` -> `RealFloatingPointField`
   - `RealNumber` -> `RealFloatingPoint`
- #24525: deprecate `is_RealNumber(x)` and `is_RealField(x)` in favour of `isinstance(x, RealFloatingPoint)` and `isinstance(x, RealFloatingPointField)`

## step 2

- Deprecate `RR` and `Reals` and use `RFF` (or `RFPF`?) as the standard name for `RealFloatingPointField(53)`?
- more documentation.

for complex numbers, see #24489.

> - change the name of `RealField`/`RealField_class` to `RealFloatingPointField`/`RealFloatingPointField_class`


Do we still need the old `RealField` given that it's no longer used after #24456?

It is. The old real field is the field of floating point numbers that is intensively used (and renamed in this ticket). The new real field is the field of real numbers (the real one).

I was talking about the `RealField()` **function**. Is that still used?

If so, I would rather rename it to `create_RealFloatingPointField`.

Some quick comments:

- why renaming `RealField` and not `RR` at the same time ?
- i am not sure that completely changing the behaviour of `RealField` without any kind of deprecation period is wise, how will the user's code survive to this change ?
- do you really plan to change a behaviour that implies modifying 164 files without even an email to sage-devel ?
- Regarding the naming, i would personally prefer `Floating-point` over `Floating Point` (as it is usually), moreover, it has the advantage that the shortcut will be `RFF` (not `RFPF`), consistently with other representations of real numbers.

It's in the experimental phase. I will need an IDE with refactoring capabilities to do this reliably and quickly, or develop scripts. Also, I think it will need its own beta.

why not. But it will
- be a much more delicate backward incompatibility.
- make the ticket even bigger
The 2 steps transition seems simpler to me.

> - i am not sure that completely changing the behaviour of `RealField` without any kind of deprecation period is wise, how will the user's code survive to this change ?


There **must** be deprecation about the name changes (which is not the case in the current branch). `RealField` shoud still point to the `FloatingPointField` (with deprecation) and `RR` should still point to `RFF` (with deprecation).

I don't think there is a need for deprecation about the change of printing.

> - do you really plan to change a behaviour that implies modifying 164 files without even an email to sage-devel ?
> - Regarding the naming, i would personally prefer `Floating-point` over `Floating Point` (as it is usually), moreover, it has the advantage that the shortcut will be `RFF` (not `RFPF`), consistently with other representations of real numbers.


+1 for Floating-point.

> - where is the doc ?

Though it would be better to first change the names:
- `RealField` -> `RealFloatingPointField_factory`
- `RealField_class` -> `RealFloatingPointField`
- `RealNumber` -> `RealFloatingPoint`
to avoid passing twice on the same lines.
