sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import acyclic_edge_coloring
sage: [acyclic_edge_coloring(G, value_only=True) for G in graphs(4)]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

According to the documentation, it should return the acyclic chromatic index of the graph.

This is easy to fix. Are you already working on a patch ? otherwise I can do it.

The returned value was wrong: instead of returned the number of colors, it was returned the value of the objective function. Since the ILP formulation is a constraints satisfaction problem without objective, it was always returning 0.

I took the opportunity of this patch to polish the method.
