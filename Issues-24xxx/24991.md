According to the documentation, it should return the acyclic chromatic index of the graph.

The returned value was wrong: instead of returned the number of colors, it was returned the value of the objective function. Since the ILP formulation is a constraints satisfaction problem without objective, it was always returning 0.

I took the opportunity of this patch to polish the method.
