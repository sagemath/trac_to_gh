psutil compilation fails with

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 253, in <module>
    macros.append(("_WIN32_WINNT", get_winver()))
  File "setup.py", line 249, in get_winver
    maj = int(m.group('major'))
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
```

because the regexp to detect windows version in `setup.py` is not adapted to my windows version, which is as follows:

```
PS C:\Users\Sebastien> cmd /c ver

Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.19]

which is why I haven't seen this.  For some reason your Windows version has an additional component not accounted for in that regexp.

I already [fixed](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998/commits/a33c43ca59fd1b5327402a637a5c02b32976ed86) this issue some time ago in my psutil Cygwin port, but never updated the patch to psutil included with Sage.  I guess it would be good to do that then.

FWIW, I just got bitten by this. From a cygwin prompt :

```
charpent@DESKTOP-P0B7HOE ~/sage
$ cmd /c ver

Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.19]
```

Since this seems to block Sage from successfully compiling on windows, I'd be tempted to raise the priority of this bug to "blocker".

I get two errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 124.4 src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 124.4 src/sage/calculus/calculus.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Both are transient (i. e. do not fail when ran standalone).

HTH,

Please let me handle this--this is already fixed in my branch of `psutil`, I just need to update the existing patch.

I don't consider it an emergency since it hasn't affected any of the machines I'm using for Windows builds.

That's what I did in my patch-to-the-current-patch, following exactly what you did in your cygwin port. I don't doubt it can be done better...(In fact : do we still need the Windows version string, since we now rely on a ficntion that dives directly the version ?
> I don't consider it an emergency since it hasn't affected any of the machines I'm using for Windows builds.

I got that after my Windows VM got upgraded to "Fall Creators Update", which I *think* introduced the new format (and triggered the error).

Re-reading this ticket, I am *quite* surprised :

* Similarly, I did **not** changed the branch nor the commit.

I do not know what happened. But I want to be absolutely clear : I am **not** trying to take over this ticket.

I have an hypothesis : I probably *unwillingly* overtook your changes, that seem to have been done while I was typing my first answer. And I didn't see the result..

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
Results so far, using Erik's branch :
* On Linux (Debian testing) :
    - 8.1.beta9 : compiles, passes ptestlong
    - after upgrade to 8.1.rc0 : compiles, passes ptestlong.
    - full recompilation (`make distclean && make ptestlong`) of 8.1.rc0 : compiles, passes ptestlong.
* On Windows 10 + "Fall Creators Update" :
    - 8.1.beta9 : compiles (ptestlong not run)
    - after upgrade to 8.1.rc0 : compiles (ptestlong not run)
    - full recompilation : *does ***not*** build*. Consistently fails building pynac, that complaints that it can't find the python library.

I'm almost sure that this failure is unrelated to #24121's target. However, I set `needs_work` to flag the problem. I can re-test whenever `needs_review` is set.
