Welcome to Sage.

There is a problem with the branch name and so I cannot access the code. 
You could use either `public/24909_boruvka_algorithm_for_mst` in which case the branch is public and can be modified by others, or `u/meghanamreddy/24909_boruvka_algorithm_for_mst` where `u/meghanamreddy/` is for user meghanamreddy.

I don't know where to find documentation on possible branch names, but both forms are commonly used.

Hello,

there are multiple possible improvements of your code. Let's start with a first round.

- You implement your own Union-Find data structure, but we already have `DisjointSet` in `src/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx`. So you should use it

- Loops / multiple edges: I'm not sure it is interesting to simplify the graph and so to make a copy. But we can let this part for later.

- for loop over edges: we can reduce the cost of this loop. Indeed, if the as soon as the end vertices of an edge are in the same component, we don't want to see this edge anymore. To do so, you first make a copy of the list of edges (before while loop). So `E = g.edges()`. Then let `E_tmp` be a list, initially empty, and during the for loop, you add to `E_tmp` the edges that are still active. After the for loop, you do `E,E_tmp = E_tmp,[]`. This way, at next iteration, you consider only active edges.

- for loop over vertices: here you want to consider only one vertex per component. To do so, a simple way is to use the dictionary `cheapest`. At the beginning of the while loop, you set `cheapest = dict()`. Then, during the for loop over edges, you use tests like `if component1 not in cheapest or ...`, and you add the edges to `cheapest` as you do (with some care). Now, the for loop over vertices can be turned to a for loop over active vertices which are the keys of `cheapest`.

Let's start with this. It should already help improving the algorithm. We will then try to speed up the code further.

Prim: no, we don't need Prim's algorithm. You can remove it from the todo list. It might be hard to provide a faster implementation than boost.

I have made the changes you suggested. 
Using the DisjointSet class has simplified the algorithm and gives more flexibility.
The second for loop, which loops over the vertices has been improved by looping over each component once. 
The first for loop has also been improved, I have kept track of active edges in each loop. However there is still room for improvement in this loop since, the list of active edges, i.e, edge_temp contains the active edges along with the edges that were added to MST in the previous iteration.

Another approach that could be followed is to replace the first for loop over the edges to a for loop over the components, find the cheapest edge for each component by iterating over its outgoing edges using edge_boundary() function.

And regarding your comment on removing the loops and multiple edges: If there are multiple edges between two vertices, only the minimum weight edge can be in the MST. Hence, when we use

```
G.to_simple(to_undirected=False, keep_label='min')
```

we keep the edges with minimum weight. The algorithm anyway works with loops and multiple edges as well.

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\n> The second for loop, which loops over the vertices has been improved by looping over each component once.\n\n\nCould you move the description of what the loop is about before the loop.\nDo the same for the first for loop. It's what is done elsewhere (at least in many places)\n\nAlso, make sure that each time you have a comment, you have a space after `#`. For instance `#reset` -> `# reset`. It's easier to read. \n\n> The first for loop has also been improved, I have kept track of active edges in each loop. However there is still room for improvement in this loop since, the list of active edges, i.e, edge_temp contains the active edges along with the edges that were added to MST in the previous iteration. This is because I'm adding an edge to edge_temp if the endpoints belong to different components. If the components are merged later, the edge still remains in the edge_temp list for the next iteration.\n\n\nThe list of active edges is `edge_list` and it contains the edges that were added to MST in previous iteration. However, the edges added to MST at previous iteration will not be added to `edge_temp`.\nThis is a good way to remove edges that are no longer active. \n\nThe drawback of this approach is that you may keep a large number of edges between between 2 components for as long that these components are not merged.\n\nOne possible improvement is to use a dictionary keyed by pairs `c1,c2`, with `c1 < c2`, recording the cheapest edge between component `c1` and component `c2`.

> The second for loop, which loops over the vertices has been improved by looping over each component once.


Could you move the description of what the loop is about before the loop.
Do the same for the first for loop. It's what is done elsewhere (at least in many places)

Also, make sure that each time you have a comment, you have a space after `#`. For instance `#reset` -> `# reset`. It's easier to read. 

> The first for loop has also been improved, I have kept track of active edges in each loop. However there is still room for improvement in this loop since, the list of active edges, i.e, edge_temp contains the active edges along with the edges that were added to MST in the previous iteration. This is because I'm adding an edge to edge_temp if the endpoints belong to different components. If the components are merged later, the edge still remains in the edge_temp list for the next iteration.


The list of active edges is `edge_list` and it contains the edges that were added to MST in previous iteration. However, the edges added to MST at previous iteration will not be added to `edge_temp`.
This is a good way to remove edges that are no longer active. 

The drawback of this approach is that you may keep a large number of edges between between 2 components for as long that these components are not merged.

One possible improvement is to use a dictionary keyed by pairs `c1,c2`, with `c1 < c2`, recording the cheapest edge between component `c1` and component `c2`. So as you loop over active edges, you store the cheapest edge between `c1` and `c2`.
Then, at the end of the first for loop, you can rebuild the set of active edges (the values stored in the dictionary), and reset the dictionary for next iteration.

This can be tested, but I don't know if it will be faster in practice than the current code.
 
> Another approach that could be followed is to replace the first for loop over the edges to a for loop over the components, find the cheapest edge for each component by iterating over its outgoing edges using edge_boundary() function.


No. The `edge_boundary` method will go over all vertices of the component, visit all edges incident to at least one vertex in the component and return the edges with only one vertex in the component. So it will visit many edges, including edges that where removed long time ago. Bad idea.

The way you do it forces to make a copy of the graph, even if the graph is simple. Please avoid that.

Also, if the method I propose above for keeping a unique active edge between each pair of components is used, there will be no need anymore for removing multiple edges/loops.


Why are you sorting the edges at the end ? There is no need for it.

The method named `boruvka_v2` is an implementation using this approach. The list of active edges, i.e., `edge_list` now will contain only the least weight edge between any pair of components. On small test cases, this approach seems to work better as the number of edges in `edge_list` decrease more as compared to the first approach. I am yet to test on bigger inputs and compare the overall performance. However, the second approach seems promising and mostly will perform better than the older approach. 

> Why are you sorting the edges at the end ? There is no need for it.

The kruskal's algorithm seemed to return sorted edges. Hence, I was sorting here also. I have changed it, now I'm not sorting the edges.

Thank you for the performance report.

Some possible improvements:
- Could try not using `edge_temp`, and so not updating the list of edges. It's an expensive operation, so I'm wondering if it is really better to do it or not.

- `if G.order() == 0:` you can do `if G.order() <= 1:`. Furthermore, this test should be outside the `check` test. It is always useful.

- We should now work on the weight function. In other methods, we use

```
if wfunction is None:
    wfunction = lambda e:e[2]
```
  You may also use an extra parameter `by_weight` such that

```
if by_weight:
   if wfunction is None:
       wfunction = lambda e:e[2]
else:
   wfunction = lambda e:1
```
  and then reduce the size of the code.
  Look at the code of other methods using weights, like shortest path methods, etc.

  You could also test if the weights are in RR when check is True.

- what happen if G is not connected and check is False ?

Currently, Kruskal's gives a runtime error if G is not connected and check is False. Hence, I thought it was an acceptable assumption. What do you think should be done?

Currently, the code runs into an infinite loop. Which is bad. However, as mentioned in the comments (which is similar to that of Kruskals), if check is False, the code assumes the input graph is connected. We could change the default value of check to True so that the users will set check to False only if they are sure that the input graph need not go through the checks. Currently, Kruskal's gives a runtime error if G is not connected and check is False. Hence, I thought it was an acceptable assumption. What do you think should be done? If the checks do not take a long time (which I verified and take about 4% of the total running time), we could perform the checks for all inputs and remove the check parameter.

I tried this and got an error stating "closures inside cpdef functions not yet supported". Closures are not yet supported in Cython? The `min_spanning_tree` is entirely in Python.

it's in Python but in a Cython file.

An alternative could be:

```
if by_weight:
    if wfunction is None:
        edge_list = G.edges()
    else:
        edge_list = [(e[0], e[1], wfunction(e)) for e in G.edge_iterator()]
else:
    edge_list = [(u, v, 1) for u,v in G.edge_iterator(labels=None)]
```
The first case assumes that e[2] is the weight of the edge, the second applies the wfunction on the edge (useful if the label is more than just a value), and the third case set the weight of each edge to 1.

Then you don't have to take care of weight function anymore, e[2] is always the weight ;)
The only drawback is that the tree edges might be different than graph edges... can you check what is done in other methods like kruskal ?

I have made the name shorter. I cannot do `numConnectedComponentsPrevIter = numConnectedComponents + 1` since I'm using a slightly different logic of updating `numConnectedComponents` at the end of the loop.

I have ensured comments are on 80 columns mode. Does the TESTS and EXAMPLES section also have this restriction? I am unable to make it 80 columns as it contains Sage code.
> The main issue I see with weights is when `wfunction is None` and the graph is unweighted. Can you try the following idea: instead of working with `edge_list = G.edges()`, use a list of tuples `(e, e_weight)`. So you compute once for all the weight of edge e when you create the list `edge_list` using `wfunction`, and then you can safely compare weights in the `for e in ` loop (which becomes `for e,e_weight in edge_list`).

I have made this change. It did not speed up the computations, but the code is simplified.

I cannot do `numConnectedComponentsPrevIter = numConnectedComponents + 1` since I'm using a slightly different logic of updating `numConnectedComponents` at the end of the loop.\n\nI mean before the while loop. Instead of computing twice the length of the list of vertices.\nActually, you can get the number of vertices as `G.order()` and the number of edges as `G.size()`. So use these methods.\n\nAlso, you have loops like `for e in G.edges()`. Please use instead `for e in G.edge_iterator()`. The reason for that is that `G.edges()` will actually build the list of edges, and then the for loop will iterate on this list, while using `G.edge_iterator()` we save the construction of the list. It's minor optimization, but it's good to know.\n\n> > - be aware that all comments must be formatted on 80 columns mode.

I mean before the while loop. Instead of computing twice the length of the list of vertices.
Actually, you can get the number of vertices as `G.order()` and the number of edges as `G.size()`. So use these methods.

Also, you have loops like `for e in G.edges()`. Please use instead `for e in G.edge_iterator()`. The reason for that is that `G.edges()` will actually build the list of edges, and then the for loop will iterate on this list, while using `G.edge_iterator()` we save the construction of the list. It's minor optimization, but it's good to know.

the 80 colimns is only for comments. Sage code can be longer. If you check at the code of the graph module, you will see from time to time that the code is sometimes split on several lines. This is mostly to improve readability (it's also important for the maintainability of the code).

> I have made this change. It did not speed up the computations, but the code is simplified.


That's the objective: simpler code, easier to read, similar performance.


I'll send you later my comments on the examples / tests. Previous sections are fine.

- <code>:meth:\`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.min_spanning_tree\`</code> add `~` before `sage`. I'm not completely sure of the syntax here, but I know it's working with `~`.

  You can rebuild the html references using: `sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`
  Add see if the documentation displays well.

- In the examples, you could start with 

```
sage: from sage.graphs.spanning_tree import boruvka
        sage: G = Graph({1:{2:28, 6:10}, 2:{3:16, 7:14}, 3:{4:12}, 4:{5:22, 7:18}, 5:{6:25, 7:24}}, weighted=True)
sage: G.weighted(True)
sage: boruvka(G, check=True)
[(1, 6, 10), (2, 7, 14), (3, 4, 12), (4, 5, 22), (5, 6, 25), (2, 3, 16)]
sage: boruvka(G, by_weight=True)
[(1, 6, 10), (2, 7, 14), (3, 4, 12), (4, 5, 22), (5, 6, 25), (2, 3, 16)]
sage: boruvka(G, by_weight=False)
[......] # I have not run the code so I don't know the correct answer
```

- then add an example of weight function like :

```
sage: boruvka(G, by_weight=True, wfunction=lambda e:e[2])
[(1, 6, 10), (2, 7, 14), (3, 4, 12), (4, 5, 22), (5, 6, 25), (2, 3, 16)]
sage: boruvka(G, by_weight=True, wfunction=lambda e:float(1/e[2]))
[......] #  I have not run the code so I don't know the correct answer
```

- and an example of non connected graph like:

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1,1), (2,3,1)], weighted=True)
sage: boruvka(G)
[]
```
- and your example with the tree, but you can fix the size of the random tree to 10. It's enough.

- In the tests, you can keep the `If the input is not a Graph::` case.

All this should already be enough, right ? or do you think it is important to show other examples ? The most important is to cover combinations of parameters with small and simple examples. your method `my_disconnected_graph` is too complex. 

To let you know, these tests / examples are tested many many times, for instance each time a new patch is proposed, even if the new patch has nothing to do with this code. So the faster the examples are the better.

Yes, the examples you mentioned covered all the cases required, so they are definitely enough. I was actually following the examples in the Kruskal's method and used the `my_disconnected_graph` method from there. I have removed the extra examples and kept only the necessary examples.

Thank you. I have added Boruvka to `min_spanning_tree` in file `generic_graph.py`.

Regarding checking if the weights are in RR, `min_spanning_tree` currently converts the weights to float and raises an exception otherwise.

```
wfunction_float = lambda e:float(weight_function(e))
```
We could instead convert the weights to RR using -

```
wfunction_float = lambda e:RR(weight_function(e))
```
Should I go ahead and make this change? Or checking if they are floating point numbers is enough?

weights: the current behavior is fine. So let it as is.

in `generic_graph.py`:
- <code>\`\`"Boruka"\`\`</code> -> <code>\`\`"Boruvka"\`\`</code>

could you add in method boruvka a test like:

```
sage: G = Graph([(u,v,randint(1,5)) for u,v in graphs.CompleteGraph(4).edges(labels=0)], weighted=True)
sage: G.weighted()
True
sage: E1 = G.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Boruvka')
sage: E2 = G.min_spanning_tree(algorithm='Prim_Boost')
sage: sum(e[2] for e in E1) == sum(e[2] for e in E2)
True
```

Thank you for guiding me through this patch. I now understand the process better and I'm familiar with the kind of errors and improvements to look out for while coding a patch/algorithm.
