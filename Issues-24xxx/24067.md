`sympy_init()` enables conversion of SymPy objects. It is called with the first initialization of a `SympyConverter`, i.e. with `Expression._sympy_()`. Better is to only call it once with any import of SymPy.

We should also revert the patch added in #24238.

What about just adding `sympy_init()` to the end of the interface file?

To make it work the `__init__` file needs to know if it is imported from sage. I'm no Python expert but I doubt that's possible. A solution to the design problem would be not to have `_sage_` member functions but a global `sage(...)` method.

Additions LGTM.

I was hoping a more conciliatory attitude and hadn't removed the positive review. This is now back to need_work. This is just un-acceptable to sage-on-distro this close to release.

`@`fbissey, that last commit, while much better than what was before, will still force all users of sympy to import sage into their python program, as long as sage is installed.

A better method might be something like this instead:

```
if 'sage.XXXX' in sys.modules:
    from sage.interfaces.sympy import sympy_init
    sympy_init()
```

where XXXX is some module that sage always imports. So the patch is only activated if sage is already imported.

This might be more acceptable to upstream as well.

No. I'm pretty sure that the release manager only merges "blocker" tickets once an rc has been released. The whole point of an "rc" is that it should be close to a release and you don't want to merge random tickets at that point.

Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore for this ticket.
