<a id='comment:11'></a>Indeed; I see the problem here.  When I originally commented on this ticket, I admit, I don't think I looked very closely at the exact test that was failing.

If there's no work for the workers to do, then there's no guarantee that you'll ever find them all running simultaneously.

If you really wanted to test this, one possibility might be to set up a test logger that collects all log messages in a list, and then checks that the expected log messages are found (e.g. one "Started" and one "Exiting" for each worker started.

Thanks to all of you for catching this one. I'm confirming jdemeyer analysis. If there is no work to do, there is no robust lower bound for the time the worker stays alive. 

`@`embray: there is a logger is the code but the level is normally set too low to see the message. Another possibilities would be to give as work to the worker a `sleep(1)` instruction.
