```
Similarly to #24457 for real numbers we perform some cleaning for complex numbers in view of #17713/#24457.

## step 1

- #24483: move `sage.rings.complex_field` to `sage.rings.complex_mpfr`
- change the string representation from `Complex Field with XX bits of precision` to `Complex Floating-point Field with XX bits of precision`
- (possibly) get rid of the factory `ComplexField` by making the class `ComplexField_class` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`
- rename `CompleNumber`/`ComplexField` into `ComplexFloatingPoint`/`ComplexFloatingPointField`
- remove the attribute `_prec` of `ComplexNumber` (a `mpfr_t` carries its precision that can be obtained with `mpfr_get_prec`)
- deprecate `is_ComplexNumber(x)`/`is_ComplexField(x)` in favor of `isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPoint)`/`isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPointField)`
- actually initialize the `mpfr_t` pointers in `__cinit__` as it is the case for real floating point numbers in `real_mpfr.pyx`
- clarify the behavior of rounding (currently there is a global (sic) variable taking care of it)
- Deprecate `CC` in favor of `CFF`

+1. I wanted to do that at some point but Marc Mezzarobba claimed that the mpfr version was faster and hence still needed. I will be more than happy to recycle this ticket in order to do this!

>> +1. I wanted to do that at some point but Marc Mezzarobba claimed that the mpfr version was faster and hence still needed. I will be more than happy to recycle this ticket in order to do this!

My bad: [it was JP Flori](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/rCvZw4c0SYM).

Yes it used to be the case, and Paul Zimmerman improved MPC but my last souvenir is that for basic operations Sage's complex_mpfr was still faster than complex_mpc surely because it does not handle special cases (NaN, infinities, and i don't know what) gracefully.

Things can have changed but there is only one way to knwom: benchmark both implementations, and I don't think I have any time for this.

On a side note, I would think it is a very good idea to get rid of complex_mpfr if we can.

First of all, checking for a special value is really trivial compared to dealing with Python objects.
