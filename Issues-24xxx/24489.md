<div id="comment:0"></div>

Similarly to #24457 for real numbers we perform some cleaning for complex numbers in view of #17713/#24457.

## step 1

- #24483: move `sage.rings.complex_field` to `sage.rings.complex_mpfr`
- change the string representation from `Complex Field with XX bits of precision` to `Complex Floating-point Field with XX bits of precision`
- (possibly) get rid of the factory `ComplexField` by making the class `ComplexField_class` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`
- rename `CompleNumber`/`ComplexField` into `ComplexFloatingPoint`/`ComplexFloatingPointField`
- remove the attribute `_prec` of `ComplexNumber` (a `mpfr_t` carries its precision that can be obtained with `mpfr_get_prec`)
- deprecate `is_ComplexNumber(x)`/`is_ComplexField(x)` in favor of `isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPoint)`/`isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPointField)`
- actually initialize the `mpfr_t` pointers in `__cinit__` as it is the case for real floating point numbers in `real_mpfr.pyx`
- clarify the behavior of rounding (currently there is a global (sic) variable taking care of it)
- Deprecate `CC` in favor of `CFF`

+1. I wanted to do that at some point but Marc Mezzarobba claimed that the mpfr version was faster and hence still needed. I will be more than happy to recycle this ticket in order to do this!

Yes it used to be the case, and Paul Zimmerman improved MPC but my last souvenir is that for basic operations Sage's complex_mpfr was still faster than complex_mpc surely because it does not handle special cases (NaN, infinities, and i don't know what) gracefully.

Things can have changed but there is only one way to knwom: benchmark both implementations, and I don't think I have any time for this.

On a side note, I would think it is a very good idea to get rid of complex_mpfr if we can.

Of course it's always going to be faster. But that's not the point. If you really want speed, use `CDF`.
