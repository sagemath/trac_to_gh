Similarly to #24457 for real numbers we perform some cleaning for complex numbers in view of #17713/#24457.

## step 1

- #24483: move `sage.rings.complex_field` to `sage.rings.complex_mpfr`
- change the string representation from `Complex Field with XX bits of precision` to `Complex Floating-point Field with XX bits of precision`
- (possibly) get rid of the factory `ComplexField` by making the class `ComplexField_class` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`
- rename `CompleNumber`/`ComplexField` into `ComplexFloatingPoint`/`ComplexFloatingPointField`
- remove the attribute `_prec` of `ComplexNumber` (a `mpfr_t` carries its precision that can be obtained with `mpfr_get_prec`)
- deprecate `is_ComplexNumber(x)`/`is_ComplexField(x)` in favor of `isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPoint)`/`isinstance(x, ComplexFloatingPointField)`
- actually initialize the `mpfr_t` pointers in `__cinit__` as it is the case for real floating point numbers in `real_mpfr.pyx`
- clarify the behavior of rounding (currently there is a global (sic) variable taking care of it)
- Deprecate `CC` in favor of `CFF`

Yes it used to be the case, and Paul Zimmerman improved MPC but my last souvenir is that for basic operations Sage's complex_mpfr was still faster than complex_mpc surely because it does not handle special cases (NaN, infinities, and i don't know what) gracefully.

Things can have changed but there is only one way to knwom: benchmark both implementations, and I don't think I have any time for this.

On a side note, I would think it is a very good idea to get rid of complex_mpfr if we can.

But that's not the point. If you really want speed, use `CDF`.\n\nThe thing that we should focus on is the correctness. With MPC, you are guaranteed that the answer that you receive is as good as it can be. With MPFR complex numbers, we are using some arbitrary formulas and we hope that everything works. On the one hand, we use an arbitrary-precision library but we cannot say whether the many bits that you get are actually meaningful.",

Replying to [jpflori](#comment%3A12):
> my last souvenir is that for basic operations Sage's complex_mpfr was still faster than complex_mpc


Of course it's always going to be faster. But that's not the point. If you really want speed, use `CDF`.

The thing that we should focus on is the correctness. With MPC, you are guaranteed that the answer that you receive is as good as it can be. With MPFR complex numbers, we are using some arbitrary formulas and we hope that everything works. On the one hand, we use an arbitrary-precision library but we cannot say whether the many bits that you get are actually meaningful.
