The `DeprecationWarning` here definitely makes sense (the code is calling `Piecewise(...)` which issues a warning.

It seems maybe an issue more with Python 2 and the seen warnings cache not being reset consistently between tests, but I haven't looked too deeply yet.

> the seen warnings cache not being reset consistently between tests

The "seen warnings cache" is not meant to be reset between tests (IMHO). It's quite useful when you deprecate something that has a lot of tests: instead of adding `DeprecationWarning` in the test output everywhere, you only need to do it once.

Of course, it doesn't answer the question why this is different in Python 3.

This also works very inconsistently depending on the order in which the tests are run.  For example, sometimes if I run the tests for a specific module I get failures because either some warning *wasn't* displayed that was expected, or more often a warning that *wasn't* expected (but is still correct) is displayed.

Maybe it would be better to have a way to ignore certain warnings in the doctests unless they're explicitly asked for (i.e. to test the warning itself).

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

I've figured out at least in part what's going on with warnings on Python 3, and it's pretty annoying.  I believe it to be a bug in Python and I'm not alone there: https://bugs.python.org/issue29672

It is a regression introduced by a previous fix to a different but related issue: https://bugs.python.org/issue4180

The original issue, which was also a reasonable problem, was that if you display some warning, say

```python
>>> def foo():
...     warnings.warn("foo")
>>> foo()
UserWarning: foo
```

Normally, that warning will be displayed once and only once.  But if you change the default warnings filter to `'always'`, the reasonable expectation (arguably) is that it should start displaying that warning again:

```python
>>> warnings.simplefilter('always')
>>> foo()
UserWarning: foo
```

On Python 2 this does *not* happen--a warning once displayed is never displayed again, even if the warnings filter is changed.

The solution to this problem, unfortunately, was something of a baseball bat.  It adds a monotonically increasing global "_filter_version" that is incremented any time the warnings filters are modified *at all*, and this version is applied to all warnings.  It also adds a 'version' to each `__warningregistry__`.  If, when a warning is to be displayed, the `'version'`  in relevant `__warningregistry__` is behind the global `_filter_version`, it ignores whether or not that warning has already been displayed, and just treats it more or less as a new warning.  This happens even if the warning filters were updated in such a way that in no way affects the warning in question, so it's really quite a blunt instrument.

What's worse, is also updates this "_filter_version" every time a `catch_warnings()` context manager is entered *or* exited, even if the warning filters were not modified at all in the context body.  This screws up how warnings are handled in the IPython prompt even in plain IPython (or Sage's prompt):

```
In [1]: import warnings

In [2]: def foo():
   ...:     warnings.warn('foo')
   ...:

In [3]: foo()
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/bin/ipython:2: UserWarning: foo
  # EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'ipython==5.5.0','console_scripts','ipython'

In [4]: foo()
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/bin/ipython:2: UserWarning: foo
  # EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'ipython==5.5.0','console_scripts','ipython'
```

This is because there's some `catch_warnings()` going on every time it displays a prompt.  From  `IPython.core.inputsplitter:InputSplitter.push`:

```
310         self._update_indent(lines)
311         try:
312             with warnings.catch_warnings():
313                 warnings.simplefilter('error', SyntaxWarning)
314                 self.code = self._compile(source, symbol="exec")
315         # Invalid syntax can produce any of a number of different errors from
316         # inside the compiler, so we have to catch them all.  Syntax errors
317         # immediately produce a 'ready' block, so the invalid Python can be
318         # sent to the kernel for evaluation with possible ipython
319         # special-syntax conversion.
320         except (SyntaxError, OverflowError, ValueError, TypeError,
321                 MemoryError, SyntaxWarning):
322             self._is_complete = True
323             self._is_invalid = True
324         else:
325             # Compilation didn't produce any exceptions (though it may not have
326             # given a complete code object)
327             self._is_complete = self.code is not None
```

This has the effect that for every line you input to the IPython prompt (and this includes multi-line input) the warnings filter is effectively reset, making it useless to try to prevent warnings from being displayed multiple times.

This also explained why we get erratic behavior w.r.t. warnings in the Sage doctests.  Although there aren't many cases directly in the doctests where we directly manipulate the warnings filter, there are at least a few (and probably more cases where we do so indirectly).  So every time that happens it resets whether a warning has been displayed =_=

I'm not really sure yet what a workaround to this would look like...

Another related issue I came up with in trying to find a workaround to this, is that even if sort of brute force work around the `_filter_version` hack, you still get incorrectly duplicated warnings when you use a deprecated function in a list comprehension expression (or possibly other generated expressions).

This came up in `sage.structure.element.generic_power`:

```
        sage: from sage.structure.element import generic_power
        sage: generic_power(int(12),int(0))
        doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: import 'generic_power' from sage.arith.power instead
        See http://trac.sagemath.org/24256 for details.
        1
        sage: generic_power(int(0),int(100))
        0
        sage: generic_power(Integer(10),Integer(0))
        1
        sage: generic_power(Integer(0),Integer(23))
        0
        sage: sum([generic_power(2,i) for i in range(17)]) #test all 4-bit combinations
        131071
```

one workaround I tried actually fixed it up to the line with the list comprehension.  In this case the frame the warning comes from is at line 1 of the exec'd code in the expression (I think), so it's effectively treated as a new warning coming from a new location.

Perhaps at least for Sage's deprecation warnings we can brute force keep our own warnings registry so that each deprecation is truly only reported once no matter what.

> Perhaps at least for Sage's deprecation warnings we can brute force keep our own warnings registry so that each deprecation is truly only reported once no matter what.

is going to end up being simplest until this is fixed upstream.  It sucks, but it's better than nothing and probably not too hard.  I could try to tackle it though it will take me a little time to reorient myself to the warnings module code, since it's been nearly a year since I last looked into it.

the `catch_warnings()` context manager is not meant to work in multithreaded environment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html

this looks like it's basically doomed to be broken for our doctests - see e.g. #28329
where this resurfaced.

I don't think threads have anything to do with this.  In that ticket the problem is just exactly what I described above: Because `catch_warnings` was used it reset some other `__warningsregistry__` and warnings that should have not been displayed again do get displayed.  Threads don't enter into it.

`catch_warnings()` has been called in context, in `with` block. Are you saying this changes global state? Then the Python docs on it are wrong.
