I think that our header will be slightly uglier with the extra space. But really, I don't want to discuss further. If you feel like the header must be changed, just do it.

How? Tools help if used correctly; in this case it means to use as a tool giving hints, not as a tool giving rules.

For some discussion about pep8 see #24076.

I mark this one as positive review.

+1 to this but that is not what you are doing here.

You are contradicting yourself: on the one hand, you say that it just gives hints. On the other hand, you think that our header file must be changed (IMHO, made uglier) because the tool tells you to.
