In SubgraphSearch in generic_graph_pyx.pyx

`__cinit__` contains the line:
self.tmp_array  = <int *>  sig_malloc(self.ng * sizeof(int))

but `__dealloc__` is missing the line:
sig_free(self.tmp_array)

This leads to a memory leak, which can be demonstrated with:

```
g=graphs.PathGraph(4)
f=graphs.CycleGraph(4)
for i in xrange(1,1000000):
    g.subgraph_search(f,induced=True)
    if i%10000==0:
        print(sage.misc.getusage.linux_memory_usage())
```

Currently, the memory usage keeps increasing (about 32 bytes per iteration of the loop). With the line added, the memory usage is constant.
