`e` and `epsilon` are just names, but granted, `epsilon` is somewhat standard. However `e` comes from the fact that the ambient space is suppose to be **Q**<sup>n</sup>. So this is a matter of taste, and personally, I have a very slight preference for the shorter `e`. However, I don't care fundamentally, so if someone else wants to change it, then don't mind me.

The rest of Sage for generic free modules is 0-based and it is not suppose to be indexed by the indexing set. In many ways, the `AmbientSpace` should inherit from the `FreeModule` code, and I don't think we should diverge from that whenever possible. So for changing the basis parameters, I am a strong -1.

In contrast, the root/weight lattice/space code is parameterized by the index set, so there, it is not really 1-based, but instead comes from the usual choice of the index set.

AmbientSpace actually inherits from CombinatorialFreeModule which does have an indexing set for its basis. The documentation notes:

 Caveat: Most of the ambient spaces currently have a basis indexed by 0,â€¦,n, unlike the usual mathematical convention.

This is the implementation in [root_system/ambient_space.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/combinat/root_system/ambient_space.py#L201)

```
    def __getitem__(self,i):
        """

        EXAMPLES::
            sage: e = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_lattice()
            sage: e[1]
            (1, 0, 0)
            sage: e[0]
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            IndexError: value out of range
        """
        if not (i > 0 and i <= self.dimension()):
            raise IndexError("value out of range")
return self.monomial(i-1)
```

I am confused. Why not use `index_set` for `basis_keys`? Or at least shift the indices in the latex output if there is a good reason to keep basis_keys in range(0, dim).

Generally speaking, I think that Sage should produce output as close to the usual mathematical standards and expectations as possible unless there is a good reason not to. What is the reason here? Why do I have to write `fix_latex` function with some regexp when I want to show my students the poset of positive roots in the epsilon basis?

I would say that could much more easily change now to `FreeModule` with `IndexedGenerators` as a mixin class compared to when it was first implemented. I think the biggest thing it uses is just the latex output. It might even be fairly easy to change this over, which would give a speed boost for arithmetic operations.

IMO, it does not make sense to have that `__getitem__` because it makes it seem like there are `n` elements in the ambient lattice. I think someone (likely Jason Bandlow) was thinking of it as a shorthand, but that shorthand is incompatible with the `__getitem__` in the rest of Sage: i.e., `e[i]` should return the `i`-th item in `e`, which does not have a well-defined ordering and is infinite. So this leads to this wrong behavior:

```
sage: e = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_lattice()
sage: list(e)
[]
sage: e.cardinality()
+Infinity
```
It should raise a `TypeError` saying it is an infinite list. In part, this is also wrong:

```
sage: e in Sets().Infinite()
False
```

> Why not use `index_set` for `basis_keys`?

Because the basis of the ambient space is not indexed by the `index_set`! For type A<sub>n</sub>, it is **Q**<sup>n+1</sup>, but for type B<sub>n</sub>, it is **Q**<sup>n</sup>, and they do **not** correspond to nodes of the Dynkin diagram.

> Or at least shift the indices in the latex output if there is a good reason to keep basis_keys in range(0, dim).

Everything in Python is 0-based and because we want to think of it as a generic rank `n` free module, it should have the natural indexing set, which is `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

> Generally speaking, I think that Sage should produce output as close to the usual mathematical standards and expectations as possible unless there is a good reason not to. What is the reason here?

Computers are naturally 0-based indexing. :)

> Why do I have to write `fix_latex` function with some regexp when I want to show my students the poset of positive roots in the epsilon basis?

If you want to change the name and latex, you can do

```
sage: e.print_options(prefix='epsilon', latex_prefix='\\epsilon')
sage: latex(sum(e.basis()))
\epsilon_{0} + \epsilon_{1} + \epsilon_{2}
```

For the other, I would just tell them it is because it is using 0-based indexing (again, stressing that the simple roots and fundamentals weights are indexed by the index set and the indexing is unrelated to the ambient space's).

Another use-case I have in mind is experimentation or checking of formulas/calculations. I have actually discovered 30 years old error in this way. The constant need for shifting by one is quite annoying and energy depleting.\n\n\n---\n\nI also wanted to add to trac another issue I encountered this summer while working with weights over a ring of symbolic variables. It was a weird thing where scalar product would yield zero for some symbolic variables but not for others. But I can't reproduce it now.\n\nAlso, I would like to propose to enhance WeylGroup action on weights containing symbolic variables. For comparison with known formulas, it would be good to have automatic translation between the basis of fundamental weights and the Bourbaki basis.\n\nGiven the above, is it reasonable to start a new issue with more substantial reimplementation to `FreeModule` that would incorporate these changes?",

[Tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.html) says

 Eventually, both implementations will be merged under the name FreeModule. In the mean time, we focus here on CombinatorialFreeModule. We recommend to start by browsing its documentation

Is the plan here to refactor all classes that use `CombinatorialFreeModule` and then get rid of it?

I think someone (likely Jason Bandlow) was thinking of it as a shorthand, but that shorthand is incompatible with the `__getitem__` in the rest of Sage: i.e., `e[i]` should return the `i`-th item in `e`, which does not have a well-defined ordering and is infinite. So this leads to this wrong behavior:

Yeah, we should probably fix this as well.

Right. Sorry. What I should've written is to use range(1, dim) for `basis_keys`.

I want to think of this as a special rank `n` (or `n+1`) free module. Namely the one found in Bourbaki.

Sure. :) But is there a real performance hit?

Thanks. Another use-case I have in mind is experimentation or checking of formulas/calculations. I have actually discovered 30 years old error in this way. The constant need for shifting by one is quite annoying and energy depleting.

I also wanted to add to trac another issue I encountered this summer while working with weights over a ring of symbolic variables. It was a weird thing where scalar product would yield zero for some symbolic variables but not for others. But I can't reproduce it now.

Also, I would like to propose to enhance WeylGroup action on weights containing symbolic variables. For comparison with known formulas, it would be good to have automatic translation between the basis of fundamental weights and the Bourbaki basis.

Given the above, is it reasonable to start a new issue with more substantial reimplementation to `FreeModule` that would incorporate these changes?
