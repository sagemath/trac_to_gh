About your irreducible preference for filter about list comprehension (which is a matter of taste), I hope that you can admit that the code here is equivalent to wrapping twice with list.

Once again I ask you to consider the fact that there remains thousands of issues to be fixed, and that my time and yours should be spared.

I agree that this is equivalent in py2. But it is not so in py3. And it is great to have a chance to play with it. And you are basically taking this chance away, without asking.

<a id='comment:7'></a>It looks fine to me.

I'm not exactly sure why the addition of `__future__.division` but if the idea is to just add it in every module I support that.

Thanks. As to adding `__future__.division`, this makes sure that the division is correct for py2 and py3.
