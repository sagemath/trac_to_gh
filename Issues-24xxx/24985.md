About using `from past` anywhere, it's a strong no-go. We should be moving to python3, not trying to stay with python2.

About your irreducible preference for filter about list comprehension (which is a matter of taste), I hope that you can admit that the code here is equivalent to wrapping twice with list.

Once again I ask you to consider the fact that there remains thousands of issues to be fixed, and that my time and yours should be spared.

First of all, what is wrong with `import past` ? Is it going away soon? No.

Second, this change of syntax is akin to going, say, from left actions to right actions in noncommutative algebra. Now imagine I start editing your texts doing such a change, for the purpose of uniformity...

I agree that this is equivalent in py2. But it is not so in py3. And it is great to have a chance to play with it. And you are basically taking this chance away, without asking.

It looks fine to me.

I'm not exactly sure why the addition of `__future__.division` but if the idea is to just add it in every module I support that.
