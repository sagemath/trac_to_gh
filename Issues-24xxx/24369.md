I still insist that we should upgrade, as the previous version also does not pass all the self-tests, albeit on a different (and much more popular) platform, x86_64 (if it is skylake- it seems to work OK on nechalem).

See the attached log.

I think it will be in the next beta (it has been merged in a sort of trunk, and this happened later than the latest ticket in the current beta(5))

this is just a quirk of the interface.
In fact the branch u/dimpase/arb212 is still there if you need it, e.g.
