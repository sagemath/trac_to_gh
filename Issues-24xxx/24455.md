```
sage: ZZ(1/2)
```
fails and (correctly) raises a TypeError while

```
sage: ZZ(QQbar(sqrt(17)))
```

fails and (incorrectly) raises a ValueError. 

This has several knock on effects, in particular vector(ZZ, [list of algebraic numbers]) all of whoms try / except blocks are set up to catch a TypeError in the event that one of the elements fails to be coerced to an integer. This in turn causes Polyhedron([(AA(sqrt(17)),)]).integral_points() to fail as this ValueError is never caught.

Keywords: **TypeError, ValueError, ZZ, QQbar**

I believe that `ValueError` for `ZZ(1/2)` is the correct one. The main reason is that the following **conversion** should work `ZZ(QQ(3))`. Hence, it is not due to the type of the object but its value.

Note that the following **coercion** should fail with a `TypeError` `ZZ.coerce(QQ(3))`.

Hmm, so does that mean that the Sequence initialiser in sage/structure/sequence.pyc should catch more types of errors since conversion can also fail due to a ValueError?

```
    455             for i in range(len(x)):
    456                 try:
    457                     x[i] = universe(x[i])
    458                 except TypeError:
    459                     raise TypeError("unable to convert {} to an element of {}"

Two possibilities

1. (line 458) `except TypeError` -> `except (TypeError, ValueError)`
2. (line 457) `x[i] = universe.coerce(x[i])`

I do prefer the second one since coercion is stricter and more predictible.

I'm not sure that we can use the second option since we still want something like:

```
vector(ZZ, [7, 3/1])
```
to succeed. However I think the first would work perfectly well.

So I certainly agree that Rational._integer_ (which raises a TypeError) and AlgebraicNumber._integer_ (which raises a ValueError) should raise the same error. However I'm not sure why AlgebraicNumber._integer_ should be changed to raise a TypeError. I would have thought that a ValueError (https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError):

would be the appropriate error for both, similar to how `int('foo')` raises a ValueError.
