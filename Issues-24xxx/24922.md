I don't see why anyone would want this:

```
+        If ``run=True` and ``clear=False``, then exit functions might
+        be run twice: once when exiting this context and again when
+        exiting Python.
```

so I would just note that `run=True` implies `clear=True`.

Me neither, but is that a sufficient reason to not support it?

What would you suggest precisely? Just to remove that piece of doc or to change the code?
