That would be:

```
? lfun([znstar(5, 1), [1]], .4+.3*I)
%36 = 0.74639976098875732745027783743802269503 + 0.30643551780851000234523726566712518702*I
```
`lfunhardy` in current Sage's Pari only accepts real input. The doctest above has complex input; I have no idea about the usefulness of complex argument results.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Let's compare results for Z with real argument, say `0.4`.

With the `DirichletGroup(5)[1]` character, lcalc-1.23 as interfaced in Sage gives `0.851280933431727` with small imaginary component; lcalc-1.3 agrees `0.851280933431744`; Pari returns `0.80484991588823009664634764248195907182`, and arb `0.85128093343172`.

With the `DirichletGroup(5)[2]` character it's `0.300129189728995`, `0.300129189729034`, and `0.95412902109286908441627436043139472906` from Pari. So the problem is with complex input and with specific characters.

Sounds like that feature was pretty much always broken and that new doctest value is "just as good" (or just as bad) as the old one. Is that correct?
