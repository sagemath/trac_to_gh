One problem worked around was that the use of FP type (double,mpfr,etc..) can be given to make but is not fixed in a header like with conf.h in other packages. I have hardcoded the type used until now (double) but this is an issue.

That would be:

```
? lfun([znstar(5, 1), [1]], .4+.3*I)
%36 = 0.74639976098875732745027783743802269503 + 0.30643551780851000234523726566712518702*I
```
`lfunhardy` in current Sage's Pari only accepts real input. The doctest above has complex input; I have no idea about the usefulness of complex argument results.

Let's compare results for Z with real argument, say `0.4`.

With the `DirichletGroup(5)[1]` character, lcalc-1.23 as interfaced in Sage gives `0.851280933431727` with small imaginary component; lcalc-1.3 agrees `0.851280933431744`; Pari returns `0.80484991588823009664634764248195907182`, and arb `0.85128093343172`.

With the `DirichletGroup(5)[2]` character it's `0.300129189728995`, `0.300129189729034`, and `0.95412902109286908441627436043139472906` from Pari. So the problem is with complex input and with specific characters.

Sounds like that feature was pretty much always broken and that new doctest value is "just as good" (or just as bad) as the old one. Is that correct?

I think we should close this in favor of #32037. Some of the test problems persist there, but I think that's the sort of bug we might overlook to get rid of our horribly outdated lcalc-1.23.
