Running Sphinx from the command-line is typically done by the `sphinx-build` script. This requires that all dependencies of Sphinx are actually installed (even if they are not used). This means that `typing` and `sphinxcontrib-websupport` should be added as dependencies of Sphinx.

Otherwise, you get errors like

```

Note that it is Sphinx itself which requires `sphinxcontrib-websupport`. This is unrelated to `cvxopt` but I'm just using that as example because of #14645.
