Running Sphinx from the command-line is typically done by the `sphinx-build` script. This requires that all dependencies of Sphinx are actually installed (even if they are not used). This means that `typing` and `sphinxcontrib-websupport` should be added as dependencies of Sphinx.

Otherwise, you get errors like
