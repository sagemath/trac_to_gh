Inspiration : Ralf Stephan in #22322. Thanks to him for nudging me in the right direction.

Goal : create a tool allowing to create reusable, stackable, assumption elements, thus allowing to get the functionality of Mathematica's `Assuming[...,???]`

What I mean :

```
sage: solve(x^2==4, x)
[x == -2, x == 2]
sage: with assuming(x>0): solve(x^2==4, x)
[x == 2]
sage: assumptions()
[]
```

Aaarghh... I've found a subtle bug: after `with assuming(): do_something()`, the original assumption database is destroyed.

That's due to the fact that `forget()` is equivalent to `forget(assumptions())`, i. e. forgets *all* facts in the database. Hoisted by a "lazy" facility...

I'll fix that (and add a couple doctests for exceptions.

Should we reconsider `forget() <==> forget(assumptions())` ?

[ Snip ... ]

To be absolutely clear : the problem existed when one used `assuming` with an *empty* argument list : you wouldn't do that from the console, but this argument list might result from another computation, which might return an empty list.

Anyway, problem fixed.

What do you mean ? I added exactly ONE function (`assuming()`), which I documented and doctested, and added a small blurb at the end of the module documentation. Since `assuming()` is designed to interact exclusively with `assume()`, I don't see what you mean.

[ Later... ] 
* Passes `ptestlong` with no error whatsoever.
* Most of the 17 patchbots seem to like it, but all but one of them complain that "a plugin failed" ; it seems that this is the "coverage" plugin. Not my watch, I'm afraid...
* Four patchbots got a failure or a timeout :
    - timeout in `src/sage/interfaces/giac.py` : doesn't seem related to my ticket ;
    - one failure on `src/sage/doctest/external.py` : ditto ;
    - timeout in `src/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py` : ditto ;
    - one failure in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py` and one timeout in `src/sage/coding/linear_code.py` : ditto.


These failures seems "too random" to have a systematic cause, and may result from a race condition somewhere in the test infrastructure. We have been plagued with such "transient" failures for some time now.

Seems good to review...
