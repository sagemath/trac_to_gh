As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40733/integrate-sqrt1-cosx-integrinterval-from-0-to-2pi/):

```
sage: integral(sqrt(1-cos(x)), x, 0, 2*pi)
0
```
This comes from the following wrong primitive

```
sage: integral(sqrt(1-cos(x)), x, algorithm='maxima')
-2*sqrt(2)/sqrt(sin(x)^2/(cos(x) + 1)^2 + 1)
```
where Fricas find a correct answer:

```
-2*(cos(x) + 1)*sqrt(-cos(x) + 1)/sin(x)
```

See [Maxima bug 3659](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3659/).

I forgot this one...

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A10):
> No reaction upstream, it seems. Their primitive is plain wrong ; Fricas is right.

More or less :

* None of maxima, giac, fricas, mathematica has a term proportional to the length if the interval of integration ; all of them are periodic, which is wrong for the integral of a non-negative function positive almost everywhere on its period.

* sympy doesn't integrate this.

* fricas' result can be differentiated and simplified back to sqrt(1-cos(x)) ; others' can't.

* giac, fricas and mathematica give results numerically close to the numerical integration up to a constant plus a discontinuity at 2*k*pi ;maxima is just plain wrong.

To summarize, contemplate :

```
sage: Num=lambda t:numerical_integral(lambda u:sqrt(1-cos(u)),0,t)[0]
sage: Max=sqrt(1-cos(x)).integrate(x, algorithm="maxima").function(x)
sage: Max=sqrt(1-cos(x)).integrate(x, algorithm="maxima").function(x)
sage: Giac=sqrt(1-cos(x)).integrate(x, algorithm="giac").function(x)
sage: Fricas=sqrt(1-cos(x)).integrate(x, algorithm="fricas").function(x)
sage: Mathematica=sqrt(1-cos(x)).integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free").function(x)
sage: plot([Num, Max, Giac, Fricas, Mathematica], (0, 4*pi), legend_label=["Numerical", "Maxima", "Giac", "Fricas", "Mathematica"])
```

It *seems* that up to the "branch cut", fricas, giac and mathematica give numerically correctly answer, only fricas' being (easily) checkable by differentiation and simplification.

BTW : when the result of an integration is a periodic function, shouldn't a term adding (floor(number of periods in the integration interval)*(integral on one period) be added to the result ? If so, how to implement this ?
