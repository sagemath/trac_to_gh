As reported on [Ask Sage question 39509 (I doesn't belong to QQbar, why?)](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39509):

```
sage: I in QQbar
False
```

This is because in the `__contains__` method of the `Parent` class, the big `try...except` fails when evaluating the following:

```
sage: bool(I == QQbar(I))
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1' and 'Algebraic Field'
```

This early fail does not allow further test to return `True`.

Fixed in #31628. We add a doctest here.
