This patch nominally tries to pep8fy `lattices.py`. The real question is discussion about pep8.

Frédéric, you might be interested in this.

What should we do to

```
if ((self.is_ranked() and len(self.meet_irreducibles()) == self.rank()) or
    self.cardinality() == 0):
    return (True, None) if certificate else True
```

I admit that it is not beatiful, pep8 got it right with E129.

Another thing, is `M[i + 1, j]` really more readabe than `M[i+1, j]`? There are also some other places where pep8fying things does not to seem help readability.

IMO, I wouldn't change this.

IMO, we should not be too strictly PEP8, which IIRC allows for breaking things for readability.

Also, while we are at it:

```diff
-if isinstance(data, FiniteMeetSemilattice) and len(args) == 0 and len(options) == 0:
+if isinstance(data, FiniteMeetSemilattice) and not args and not options:
```

I changed those `len(foo) == 0` -lines. (And merged to new beta, as I have a compilation problem.)

Now we have following pep warnings:

```
185 E501 line too long 
  6 E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
  4 E129 visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
  2 E731 do not assign a lambda expression, use a def
  2 E202 whitespace before ')'
  2 E201 whitespace after '('
```

Long lines are mostly impossible to avoid. As for E201/E202 I think it **adds** readability to use spaces in a long line where outer parentheses are used for line continuation, like

```
if ( (foor+bar)*zyzzy > 42 and
     some_value*2 < 101 ):
```

What about lambda expressions? Is there a real reason to use `def` instead of them? ...actually, why I would use Python in first place if I don't use lambdas...

Ah, that was what pep8 complains. First of all, there may be places where a lambda is used more than once. This is not case here. But still, to me

```
go_up = lambda v: [v_ for v_ in H.neighbors_out(v) if v_ not in above_a]
for v in H.depth_first_search(e, neighbors=go_up):
```

seems easier than

```
for v in H.depth_first_search(e, neighbors=lambda v: [v_ for v_ in H.neighbors_out(v) if v_ not in above_a]):
```

Hence I mark this as needs_review.

For the future it could be nice to pep8-check modified lines, i.e. combine the output with the output of `git diff develop`.

Currently we have "Follow the standard Python formatting rules when writing code for Sage - - pep-0008" in the devel manual. From this experience I would say that at most we should add something to soften the tone. ", if there are no special reason to do otherwise." or similar. Maybe nothing.

`git blame` is hard to use in any case - Frédéric has already touched an enormous number of lines when doing modification for Python3 and has made many typo corrections in the same time.

More general: Should we have more visible way to automatically say "Hey! Please check this!" to a developer from trac? We can not reject the code for being not-pep8-compliant, but we could ask for confirmation.
