This is a followup to #24045:

This is generalisation of Paley digraphs from #24045, due to A.Duval, [â€‹J.Comb.Th. 47(1988) pp. 71-100](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009731658890043X), nowadays called strongly regular digraph/tournament. We can use code in comment 14 of #24045, and Paley would be a subcase (in fact, this code will give you Paley if 4n-1 happens to be a prime power).

Component: **graph theory**
