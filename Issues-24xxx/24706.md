Volker has asked (several times in sage-devel) that one creates such a make target to monitor progress on python3 sage.

For the moment, on vanilla-sage, only "make build" will work. Maybe one day one will add the html documentation construction and then also the tests..

ok for changing the name of the target, sure.

As far as I can tell, html-doc does not build. Only Erik knows if we are close or not to

> What do you mean by "no go" ? It think it is rather important to prevent regression in the build process. This has just happened with subprocess32.
