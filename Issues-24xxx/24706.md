to test things that should work already on py3. Then set up a buildbot to monitor regressions....

Currently, only the build should work

Some possible next steps to activate when ready: "html-doc" and "sage-starts"

Depends on #24729

Volker has asked (several times in sage-devel) that one creates such a make target to monitor progress on python3 sage.

For the moment, on vanilla-sage, only "make build" will work. Maybe one day one will add the html documentation construction and then also the tests..

ok for changing the name of the target, sure.

As far as I can tell, html-doc does not build. Only Erik knows if we are close or not to 
achieve that.
