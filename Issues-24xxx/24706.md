to test things that should work already on py3. Then set up a buildbot to monitor regressions....

Currently, only the build should work

Some possible next steps to activate when ready: "html-doc" and "sage-starts"

Volker has asked (several times in sage-devel) that one creates such a make target to monitor progress on python3 sage.

For the moment, on vanilla-sage, only "make build" will work. Maybe one day one will add the html documentation construction and then also the tests..

ok for changing the name of the target, sure.
