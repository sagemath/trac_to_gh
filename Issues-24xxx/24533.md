With #24510 this still fails:

```
sage: k = GF(4)
sage: k.<a> = GF(4)
sage: R.<b> = k[]
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(b^2 + b + a)
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(l)
sage: R.<t> = K[]
sage: F = t*x
sage: F.factor(proof=False)
TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
```


Depends on #24510

Two more comments:

* You have

```
sage: k = GF(4)
sage: k.<a> = GF(4)
```
in two places.  The first `k` is superfluous.
* You remove an example of factorization over `CC`.  I glanced at that file and didn't see it elsewhere; why remove the test?

I fixed the first issue.

As for the second, the example is not related to that method, so it should certainly not be the first example there. The correct `factor()`/`_factor_univariate_polynomial()` methods already have a few examples about complex factorization and I don't think that this one was added because it is interesting or tracking a bugfix. I could add it to the univariate `factor()` if you think it should not be lost for unittests.
