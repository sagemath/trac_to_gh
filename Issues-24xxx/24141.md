We are getting more speed out of the Kleber tree by:

- Using the brute force enumeration for "small" number of possible branches.
- Better Python code.
- Only build the dense Cartan matrix once.

By avoiding the polytopes, I get the following

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['F',4,1], [[3,8]])
sage: %time RC.kleber_tree()
CPU times: user 4.94 s, sys: 16 ms, total: 4.96 s
Wall time: 2.78 s
Virtual Kleber tree of Cartan type ['F', 4, 1] and B = ((3, 8),)
```
in contrast to

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['F',4,1], [[3,8]])
sage: %time RC.kleber_tree()
CPU times: user 2min 40s, sys: 340 ms, total: 2min 41s
Wall time: 29 s
Virtual Kleber tree of Cartan type ['F', 4, 1] and B = ((3, 8),)
```
Note that I am using `normaliz` on a machine with 4 CPUs + 4 hyperthreaded cores, which works very well for getting those initial branchings.

By being better about how often we are creating a dense matrix (in other words, only do it once!), I got some more speed:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['F',4,1], [[3,8]])
sage: %time len(RC.kleber_tree())
CPU times: user 3.58 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 3.59 s
Wall time: 2.08 s
3395
```

There might be a better way to pre-prune in `_children_iter_vector` as I believe the edge roots need to be symmetric as well. So by utilizing the folding, we could further limit the number of cases checked by the virtual Kleber trees. I might do that tomorrow, but it could easily enough go on a followup.
