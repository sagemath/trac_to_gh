```
The `matplotlib/__init__.py` module contains `from `__future__` import unicode_literals` which is often inadvisable, as it can run afoul of some of Python's own unicode bugs.

In particular at one point it calls `os.path.expanduser('~')`, where because of `unicode_literals` this becomes `os.path.expanduser(u'~')`.  This does not take care to decode the results of `os.environ['HOME']` (assuming it is ASCII), and ends up concatenating a unicode string with a non-unicode string, which means trying to first decoded the non-unicode string with the default (ASCII) encoding.

This is a bug in matplotlib but it affects Sage users, particularly on Windows where non-ASCII usernames are more common (may also affect OSX users): https://ask.sagemath.org/question/40131/sagemath-80-using-windows-installer

**Upstream report:** https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10017

Depends on #25702

**CC:**  @slel epalezzato

**Keywords:** matplotlib, days94

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Reviewer:** Erik Bray
