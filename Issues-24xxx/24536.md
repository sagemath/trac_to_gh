The rethrown error comes from an attempt to do `float(I)`.

The find_local functions use `FastFloatConverter` to compute values.

Apparently "Float" literally means Python (real) "float" not floating-point. Of course then expressions containing `I` raise errors, even if the outcome is real. The original case was the usage by `find_local_maximum`---so that never worked, and the restriction was undocumented.

As promised, I've factored out a superclass of the `FastCallablePlotWrapper` that won't ignore complex results and will instead raise an error. This is more suitable for functions like `find_root()` and `find_local_minimum()` where a complex result can't really be ignored.

Those two functions (and the "maximum" alias) have been updated, but I'm sure there are others where the same strategy can easily be applied.

So you're not satisfied with solving easy problems all day? =)

It's awkward, and I'm open to suggestions.

I think the original name that I chose for the plotting wrapper was `FastCallableOutputWrapper`, which is more or less what it does. It wraps a fast-callable, and converts its output to... something else. But I was already aware that this ticket was going to require a different wrapping behavior. Since the behavior of the plot wrapper (returning `NaN` when it gets a complex answer) is so unique to plotting, I settled on `FastCallablePlotWrapper`.

The class for this ticket then sits beneath an abstract `FastCallableOutputWrapper` in my head. Unlike the plot wrapper, it doesn't do anything unusual during conversion, so it would rightly sit beside sibling classes such as `FastCallableComplexWrapper` or `FastCallableIntWrapper`.

I thought about naming this class `FastCallableFloatOutputWrapper`, and maybe that's a better choice, since "Plot" isn't what the "Plot" wrapper outputs. It's just so looooooooong.

Replying to [mkoeppe](#comment%3A24):
> In the implementation of `FastCallableFloatWrapper` I don't really see anything that is specific to using a fast callable. Perhaps it would make sense to generalize the concept, to get to a more manageable naming scheme?


How about `UnembedFloatFromCDF` and `UnembedPlotFloatFromCDF`?

For now we could also do `UnembedFloatFromCDF(nan_on_error=<bool>)` to cover both cases, but then if the class hierarchy is ever extended upwards or laterally, the `nan_on_error` parameter isn't going to be consistent.
