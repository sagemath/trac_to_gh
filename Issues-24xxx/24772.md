In the comment you are talking about UTF-8 but you actually decode using the locale. Wouldn't UTF-8 make the most sense here?

Also a typo: "no some" -> "not some"

I think the use of "UTF-8" in the comment is an artifact--I'm using it as a placeholder for "whatever the correct encoding is".  But actually I need to investigate that a bit more carefully.  I think what this really ought to be is whatever encoding Python is using for `sys.stdout` but it may be more complicated than that.

It seems some of the patchbots in fact, however they happen to be configured, are returning `'ascii'` for `locale.getpreferredencoding()`.  I'll just make it UTF-8 for now and we can revisit locale-specific encodings if it comes up.
