In the comment you are talking about UTF-8 but you actually decode using the locale. Wouldn't UTF-8 make the most sense here?

Also a typo: "no some" -> "not some"

I think the use of "UTF-8" in the comment is an artifact--I'm using it as a placeholder for "whatever the correct encoding is".  But actually I need to investigate that a bit more carefully.  I think what this really ought to be is whatever encoding Python is using for `sys.stdout` but it may be more complicated than that.
