When running these tests (and possible others; need to check) I'm getting a lot of error messages + tracebacks from Cysignals on a debug build:

I trimmed the traceback after this point since it appears to just be Python's stack.

It seems likely to do with the use of `sig_realloc` inside GMP/MPIR in a multi-threaded environment, whereas we know cysignals is not currently thread safe.  We should probably disable its use before calling this multi-threaded procedure...

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

This is still a problem I'm seeing.  It goes away when building cysignals without debug, but that's just because the messages aren't being displayed.  The underlying problem is probably still there.
