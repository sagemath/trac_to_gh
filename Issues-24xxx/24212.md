CC:  @mforets

The SymPy-Sage interface raises an error because there are no Fresnel integral functions in Sage: 

```
sage: integrate(sin(x^2), x, algorithm='sympy')
...
AttributeError: 

see:

sage: import sympy
sage: x = sympy.Symbol('x')
sage: sympy.integrate(sympy.sin(x^2), x)
3*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*fresnels(sqrt(2)*x/sqrt(pi))*gamma(3/4)/(8*gamma(7/4))
```
They are holonomic so they should be in Sage.

This is a tentative implementation of sine Fresnel integral. The numerical evaluation relies on mpmath. I doubtedÂ about how to write the custom evaluation `_eval_` method. In fact I have two failing doctests. I expect:

```python
sage: fresnel_sin(0)
0
sage: fresnel_sin(x).subs(x==0)
0
```

whereas i get `fresnel_sin(0)` in both cases. Any hints?

Returning `None` (or just passing) in `_eval_` amounts to returning a held expression. `_evalf_` is only used for inexact arguments or `.n()`:

```
sage: fresnel_sin(0.)
0.000000000000000
sage: fresnel_sin(0).n()
0.000000000000000
```
For results to exact or symbolic arguments you need to implement them in `_eval_`.

`random_expr` is really interesting. It should be made easier to debug, and errors caught/not caught should be reviewed because `TypeError`s from ECL represent real bugs and `RuntimeError`s from Pynac should be rebranded in the Python layer. Also sometimes it takes really really long time. After that, someone should do a day-long run to catch any remaining problems.

The reason why the doctest fails is that, despite fixing the random seed, the functions and symbols picked by `random_expr` are different. This, at some point in the buildup of the expression, leads to the sub-expression `kronecker_delta(-0.6165326641917295 + 0.15117833554974136*I, e)` which immediately evaluates to `0`.

The author of the doctest apparently just chose a random seed that happens to not throw errors.

Of course the actual bug is that `random_expr` changes behaviour when unrelated code is changed.
