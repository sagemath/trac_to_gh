Oops, I derped. Looks good. But:

* In the class doc of `GeneralizedTamariLattice`, I'd replace `a \geq b \times m` by `a \geq bm`. The \times is misleading, as it makes me think of a rectangle.

* Is the lattice property of a `GeneralizedTamariLattice` still a conjecture?

Well, I think so.

Of course, the m-Tamari lattices themselves are known to be lattices.

In general no, and this is more subtle. In this sage procedure, the generalisation goes beyond that of Preville-Ratelle and Viennot, because shape and slope become independant parameters.
