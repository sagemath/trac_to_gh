The reason for the relative big error is in the formula that is applied in `libs/pynac/pynac.pyx`: `return -I*py_log((x + I*y)/py_sqrt(x**2 + y**2))` with `x=CDF(I), y=1`. The denominator `sqrt(x**2 + y**2)` would be 0, but `CDF(I)^2` is `-1.0 + 1.2246467991473532e-16*I` and so the sqrt denominator becomes `7.82510958117314e-09 + 7.825109581173138e-09*I`.

For any other complex type of `I` as second argument I get an exception so I'm tempted to mark it as known bug.
