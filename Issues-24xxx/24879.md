I found a typo in the Sage documentation, at the function `period()`:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_standard/sage/rings/rational.html#sage.rings.rational.Rational.period

It should be

```
In general if d=2^a5^bm where m is coprime to 10
```
instead of

```
In general if d=2^a3^bm where m is coprime to 10
```
