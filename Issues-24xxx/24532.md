Tests are showing that (at least for some use cases) PARI is slower than lcalc. Part of the reason is that lcalc has optimizations for specific L-functions while PARI works in much larger generality.

So replacing lcalc is a bad idea.

That's a shame. `lcalc` will probably become a higher and higher maintenance cost in the future - unless upstream `lcalc` pick up maintenance again.

lcalc is not a trivial package :-) The PARI developers are aware of lcalc and what it does. So, if it would be easy, they would already have done it.
