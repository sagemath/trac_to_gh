I already have a patch for patchbot that will allow it to test tickets with new packages.  It's been running on my Cygwin patchbot for a while now, but it does occasionally run into hiccups requiring me to manually restart the patchbot (after cleaning things up a bit).

I especially am not 100% sure why this happens sometimes, since the patchbot creates a copy of SAGE_LOCAL for "unsafe" tickets before doing much else.

Totally agree with Jeroen, another ticket please. 

That being said, historically we have migrated `sphinxify.py` from `sagenb` into sage to reduce dependency on `sagenb` (that's what I remember at least). If you want to work on that, I would really suggest to try eliminating the `sphinxify.py` of `sagenb` and use sage's one instead.
