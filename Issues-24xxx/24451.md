This patch adds a method Polyhedron.get_integral_point(index) which returns the nth integral point in the polyhedron. It is equivalent to sorted(Polyhedron.integral_points())[index]. However when Polyhedron.integral_points_count() does not need to enumerate all of the integral points, for example in rational Polyhedra, neither does this method. Hence it can be significantly faster.

This method is useful for performing random sampling of integral points since it allows points to be chosen uniformly at random via:

```
    index = randint(0, P.integral_points_count())
    point = P.get_integral_point(index)
```

Mark,

As we discussed in Warwick, this method is rather unnatural (integer points are not naturally indexed) and is not needed for random sampling. To my mind, it would make more sense to have a new method `.random_integral_point` implemented along the same lines.

Though, I do not think I was right: e.g. integral points are naturally indexed for the lexicographical ordering. In the description, you claim to follow the ordering of `integral_points`. Is it always lexicographic? I could not find any mention of ordering in the documentation. Note in particular that `integral_points` claims to have two implementations

Uses either the naive algorithm (iterate over a rectangular
bounding box) or triangulation + Smith form.
```
The ordering is independent of the method?

BTW, your branch `u/mcbell/polyhedron_get_integral_point` does not exist. Is that normal?

About `get_integral_point` vs `random_integral_point` you are free to do whatever you want with your ticket :-)

Ah, you are correct, you are not guaranteed to get lexicographical ordering when the triangulation method is used. In part this is caused by the fact that the points that are found in the different triangles are just merged together using a set. Perhaps L5288 of src/sage/geometrypolyhedron/base.py should become "return tuple(sorted(points))" to make the method deterministic. So the correct thing to say is that this method returns

```
sorted(self.integral_points())[index]
```
I've updated the docstring and above explanation to reflect this.

My new suggestion, which is in the latest commits, is to also add a Polyhedron.random_integral_point() method that just uses the snippet I posted originally.

Concerning, `P.integral_points()`, I think that it should even be an iterator (as most things in Python3). Hence I am against sorting. If the user needs a sorted list, she can just apply a sort on the result.

For polytopes "with small interior", I believe that it is much faster to compute the set of points first and then do random sampling (while keeping the list in some cache). But let us keep that for later on.

For more concrete comments: when the polytope has no integral points the method `random_integral_point` should raise an `EmptySetError` (from `sage.categories.sets_cat`). And in both methods, the error have to be doctested. It should look like

```
sage: my_polytope_without_integral_points.random_integral_point()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
EmptySetError: error-message
```
(you can have a look around in the code)

For random sampling you should not use the directly the `random` module but

```
sage: from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
sage: random = current_randstate().python_random()
sage: random.randint(0,5)
0
sage: random.randint(0,5)
5
```
The reason is that Sage has to take care of a lot of random generators coming from different libraries (Python, gmp, GAP, PARI/GP, etc). All of them are initialized through a unique function `set_random_seed`. As a consequence, all the generators has to be taken from the `current_randstate`.

You can compare

```
sage: set_random_seed(5); [current_randstate().python_random().randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)]
[0, 5, 2, 3, 5]
sage: set_random_seed(5); [current_randstate().python_random().randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)]
[0, 5, 2, 3, 5]
```
versus

```
sage: import random
sage: set_random_seed(5); [random.randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)]
[9, 8, 3, 8, 2]
sage: set_random_seed(5); [random.randint(0,10) for _ in range(5)]
[9, 6, 1, 8, 5]

Why do you consider the inequality `[-lower] + [0] * i + [1] + [0] * (D - i - 1)`. Shouldn't this be redundant?

I believe that it would be faster to just add one equality at a time (we can possibly speed that up later on). Namely, I would rather keep the polyhedron `self` intersected with `extra_eqns` along the loop. In pseudo code

```
P = self
for i in {0, ..., dimension-1}:
    P_left = P intersection left_guess
    count_left = P_left.count()
    if count_left < index:
        P = P_left
    else:
        P = P intersection right_guess
        index -= count_left
```

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A15):
> Why do you consider the inequality `[-lower] + [0] * i + [1] + [0] * (D - i - 1)`. Shouldn't this be redundant?

So this was needed precisely because of the fact that previously found inequalities were not added to the polyhedron.

Sure, that would probably be even faster since the polyhedron will become smaller as the process goes on. I've just finished a new version based on your pseudo-code which repeatedly defines P as the intersection of P with a halfspace. Although of course it includes a while loop to keep doing the subdivisions on the x_i coordinate until it is uniquely determined.

On the other hand, the OUTPUT section is intended to describe the output type (and is not mandatory). As your function is simple enough, I would just remove it. You can merge the paragraph describing the method and the one from the OUTPUT.
