Replace `__nonzero__` with `__bool__` for Python 3.

On Python 2 alias `__bool__` back to `__nonzero__` and delete `__bool__`.
This allows `SageObject._test_not_implemented_methods` to pass on Python 2 and 3 for classes that implement this abstract interface.

This could just as easily be done the other way around and I'm not overly particular about it--I just prefer `__bool__` for its clearer name.

Is there anything wrong with just doing

```
__nonzero__ = __bool__
```
unconditionally (as we do in many places in Sage)?

What you are doing here seems like needless complexity...

Yes, in this *specific* case.  Again it has to do with the `SageObject._test_not_implemented_methods`.  It loops over an object's `dir()` and in this case may find a `__nonzero__` that's not implemented.
