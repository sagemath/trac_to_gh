If this is really meant for installations as "root", then the installation in `DESTDIR` should already be done under the "sudo" user. So I think that this patch actually reverses existing correct behaviour.

=> Proposal: close as wontfix.

I'm not sure about that.  In the staged installation, the install to `DESTDIR` step should be treated as a "build" step, and doesn't need to have root privileges to run.  I don't know what makes you think it should be done as root.

On Debian, fakeroot is provided and I believe install to the `DESTDIR` is done using fakeroot.  But in Debian's case that's because it's being used to build binary tarballs, and you want the files in the resulting tarball to be owned by "root" (but fakeroot allows you to do this without *actually* having to gain root privileges on the system you're building on).  For Sage's purposes this isn't necessary because we're not building binary tarballs--at least for now it's just a step needed for easily building a file manifest.

So only the actual install into `SAGE_LOCAL` should be done with elevated privileges, if any.

Well, it looks like maybe there are some other problems with root installs.  For example, if you try to run something like `./configure --prefix=/opt/sage` where `/opt/sage` is owned by root, it will fail because the `configure` script tries to create some directories under `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

But if you run `sudo ./configure` (which really, you shouldn't have to in the first place) it fails because of `AC_CHECK_ROOT`.
