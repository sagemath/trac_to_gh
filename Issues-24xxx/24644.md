If this is really meant for installations as "root", then the installation in `DESTDIR` should already be done under the "sudo" user. So I think that this patch actually reverses existing correct behaviour.

I'm not sure about that.  In the staged installation, the install to `DESTDIR` step should be treated as a "build" step, and doesn't need to have root privileges to run.  I don't know what makes you think it should be done as root.
