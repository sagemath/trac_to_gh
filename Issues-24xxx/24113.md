Why are you testing if the graph is circular planar ? This is much more expensive than the other tests.

Make `cutverts` a set to speed up the test `v not in cutverts`.

In the examples/tests, you could take a 2 x 3 grid graph. Removing any edge, you get a cactus.

The empty graph is a cactus.

Loops are of course allowed here, but what about multiple edges ?

See the last test `Graph('Fli@?')`, it will fail if you remove the test for circular planarity.

> Make `cutverts` a set to speed up the test `v not in cutverts`.


Good point, done.

> In the examples/tests, you could take a 2 x 3 grid graph. Removing any edge, you get a cactus.


Hmm... At least some example with "tail" would be good.

> The empty graph is a cactus.


?? By this function, yes. Should it be? It is tested.

> Loops are of course allowed here, but what about multiple edges ?


I don't know. Maybe just `_scream_if_not_simple()`?

Right, but can we think to a faster test ?

I don't know if it should be, but it is what your method answers.

First, this does not work. See `Graph('Gx?HxC')`. My bad.

I added an example and check for being simple.

As the empty graph already is, say, planar, I see no reason not to define it as cactus too.

OK, let's go back to the definitions.

In a cactus graph, a biconnected component is either a cycle or a bridge.
Now, consider the faces of the graph (`self.faces()`). We must have one face containing all vertices, and then each block that is not a bridge must be a face. So the number of faces must be 1 plus the number of blocks of order > 2 (blocks that are not bridges). So we get:

```
    self._scream_if_not_simple()
    if not self.order():
        return True
    if not self.is_connected():
        return False
    B,C = self.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
    # the number of faces is 1 plus the number of blocks of order > 2
    return len(self.faces()) == sum(1 for b in B if len(b) > 2) + 1
```
Here I consider that a graph made of two cycles connected by a path is a cactus. If this is compatible with the definition (i.e., considering that a bridge is a C2), then above code do the job.

Good to go.

> Good to go.


So do we.

Would be nice exercise to make a faster function. If the function searching blocks founds just one block that is not cycle nor a single vertex, it could instantly return `False`.
