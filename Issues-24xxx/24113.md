Why are you testing if the graph is circular planar ? This is much more expensive than the other tests.

Make `cutverts` a set to speed up the test `v not in cutverts`.

In the examples/tests, you could take a 2 x 3 grid graph. Removing any edge, you get a cactus.

The empty graph is a cactus.

Loops are of course allowed here, but what about multiple edges ?

See the last test `Graph('Fli@?')`, it will fail if you remove the test for circular planarity.

> Make `cutverts` a set to speed up the test `v not in cutverts`.

Good point, done.

> In the examples/tests, you could take a 2 x 3 grid graph. Removing any edge, you get a cactus.

Hmm... At least some example with "tail" would be good.

?? By this function, yes. Should it be? It is tested.

I don't know. Maybe just `_scream_if_not_simple()`?

Right, but can we think to a faster test ?

I don't know if it should be, but it is what your method answers.

First, this does not work. See `Graph('Gx?HxC')`. My bad.

I added an example and check for being simple.

As the empty graph already is, say, planar, I see no reason not to define it as cactus too.

Then, about the speed... Testing for planarity is `O(n)`, as is adding the universal vertex to check being outer planar. We can assume that the graph is very sparse, as we can first check if there are so many edges that the graph can not be cactus. We should start from a vertex of degree at least three, make a circuit and remove edges in the circuit. Then... duh, back to the drawing board.

OK, let's go back to the definitions.

In a cactus graph, a biconnected component is either a cycle or a bridge.
Now, consider the faces of the graph (`self.faces()`). We must have one face containing all vertices, and then each block that is not a bridge must be a face. So the number of faces must be 1 plus the number of blocks of order > 2 (blocks that are not bridges). So we get:

```
    self._scream_if_not_simple()
    if not self.order():
        return True
    if not self.is_connected():
        return False
    B,C = self.blocks_and_cut_vertices()
    # the number of faces is 1 plus the number of blocks of order > 2
    return len(self.faces()) == sum(1 for b in B if len(b) > 2) + 1
```
Here I consider that a graph made of two cycles connected by a path is a cactus. If this is compatible with the definition (i.e., considering that a bridge is a C2), then above code do the job.

So do we.

Would be nice exercise to make a faster function. If the function searching blocks founds just one block that is not cycle nor a single vertex, it could instantly return `False`.
