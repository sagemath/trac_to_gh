1. In `__richcmp__`, you really should deal with the case of different classes. Typically, this is done by adding

```
if not isinstance(other, TheClassThatYouWant):
    return NotImplemented
```
Otherwise, things might break sooner or later (see #19628 for an example of such breakage).

2. Once you did check the class with `isinstance()`, you can do a cast. So replace

```
cdef TheClassThatYouWant x = other
```
by

```
x = <TheClassThatYouWant>other
```
(you can still add `cdef TheClassThatYouWant` but that is redundant).

3. In the light of Cython 0.28, I would prefer to see

```
def __richcmp__(TheClassThatYouWant self, other, int op)
    ...
```
instead of

```
def __richcmp__(self, other, int op)
    cdef TheClassThatYouWant s = self
```
Ideally, Cython should know that `self` is of type `TheClassThatYouWant`. But this is not the case due to a Cython bug which is fixed in version 0.28.
