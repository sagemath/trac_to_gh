According to git blame, the user labels were introduced in 2015/16 by Ben Strasser and Gregg Musiker. The current implementation creates several issues with the internal data structure that are relevant for #22381.

I believe, the correct approach would be to store a user vertex labelling into an extra attribute (as done in `_nlist` and `_mlist`, possibly together with its inverse dictionary) and only call it from there. **But do not** store the internal digraph according to this labelling.

Main reason:

* many of the internal functionality of quivers, such as its mutation class computation assumes that the digraph vertices are called 0 ... m+n-1, and that the vertices 0 ... n-1 are mutable and n ... n+m-1 are frozen, see e.g.,
`_dg_canonical_form`.

Alternative reason:

* I was just about to move quiver mutation to use cluster mutation instead of digraph mutation, because the latter is broken and the matrix mutation is anyways much (10x) faster. But it seems now rather hard to produce a digraph from a matrix with a given labelling (this is a time critical operation!).

What are the advantages to actually relabel the digraph and walk the `_nlist` and `_mlist` around in all methods?

Beside, the following seems to be a bug

```
self._nlist = list(user_labels.keys())[0:n]
self._mlist = list(user_labels.keys())[n:n+m]
```
For example,

```
sage: ClusterQuiver(M,user_labels={"B":0,"A":2,"C":1})
sage: ClusterQuiver(M,user_labels={"B":0,"A":1,"C":2})
```
coincide and the values of the user_labels are never ever used anywhere, and the keys are used in the computer specific internal ordering.

I would appreciate if you could reconsider these user labellings -- thanks! I will put #22381 on hold until this is solved in one way or another.

You may have found a bug with using user_labels as dictionaries.  This part of the original code was written by aram.dermenjian, who I am CC-ing here.  

It is quite possible that the current implementation can be optimized, and I have no problems with storing the labels separately per-se.  I do believe that it is important to allow users to call ClusterQuiver on a (labeled) DiGraph, and to declare arbitrary vertices of the input DiGraph as "frozen."

I have no problem with using default labeling for the internal digraph as long as the above functionality remains.

I'll now address your "main reason."  We did make an effort to ensure that fast, internal computations (such as mutation_class if I recall correctly) are done on copies of the cluster quiver with default labeling, so many of these operations shouldn't be significantly slower.

@bhutz: I am totally fine with creating a cluster seed from a vertex and edge labelled digraph `G = (V,E)` with `frozen` being a subset of `V` declared to be frozen.

But I also believe that this input should be parsed internally to a quick to access and use structure:
Provide a list `Vs` of all vertices such that the first n are mutable and the final m are not mutable and a dict `Vs_inv` telling which vertex goes to which index. Now, the **only** place where your input labelling is stored is this list and the dict, and nowhere else. In particular, the `_digraph` should now be a graph using vertices 0 ... n+m-1.

If you mutate at a vertex v, you first look up `v` in `Vs_inv` to see which internal number `i` it has, and then mutate internally at `i`.

Important here: the lookup creates an overhead that is currently carried around also for the standard labelling. I wonder how much this is, because it can easily bypassed if you have a flag that tells if the quiver has standard vertex labelling or not.

I was not involved in creating this functionality, nor in its reviewing process. But I would still hope that this overhead is currently negligible.
