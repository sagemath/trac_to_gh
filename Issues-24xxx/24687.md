The Peirce summand in finite dimensional algebra is wrong. If the summand eAe
for an idempotent e is of dimension 1, then the summand is the span of the
idempotent iself. Before the fix::

```
sage: from sage.monoids.hecke_monoid import HeckeMonoid
sage: M = HeckeMonoid(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: A = M.algebra(QQ)
sage: e = A.orthogonal_idempotents_central_mod_radical()[0]
sage: e.coefficient(M.one())
0
sage: len(e)
1
```
The following demonstrate that e does not belong to its own summand which is wrong

```
sage: A.peirce_summand(e, e)
Free module generated by {0} over Rational Field
sage: f = A.peirce_summand(e, e).basis()[0].lift()
sage: f.coefficient(M.one())
1
sage: len(f)
24
```
The reason is that some matrix is not properly read.

That's exactly what the line

```
sage: S = A.peirce_summand(e, e); S
Free module generated by {0} over Rational Field

Ah, right. Actually, we are overthinking this:

```
sage: S.retract(e) in S
True
```
Ideally we should not need the retract, but that is a separate deficiency IMO of `SubmoduleWithBasis` (instead using `CombinatorialFreeModule.__contains__`, which just checks the `parent(x) == self`).

This is a much better tests. Actually the `in S` is not needed. Retract breaks:

```
ValueError: B[map: ...] is not in the image

I left it anyway. And fixed a typo elsewhere by the way.

Thank you. Like I said, ideally the test would just be `e in S`, but that is a separate issue.

LGTM modulo `TESTS::` -> `TESTS:` since you have plain-text after it. Addendum: also capitalize Pierce in the `TESTS:` block. Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
