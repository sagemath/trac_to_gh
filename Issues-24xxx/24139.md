Currently they are too restrictive on the keywords, in particular they do not allow passing `baseline` to the created object. This means to set the baseline, we have to do

```
sage: a = ascii_art('2\n1\n0')
sage: a._baseline = 1
sage: a + ascii_art('<-')
2
1<-
0
```
This makes them quite cumbersome to deal with.

<a id='comment:4'></a>**The improvements to the ascii_art and unicode_art classes work well**. But I noticed two cases where my intuition about the usage of the keywords failed. The first one does also concern the preliminary version and has nothing to do with the changes:

1) 'sep'-keyword is ignored if a list is passed (since it is considered as one object)


```
sage: ascii_art(list(Partitions(6)), sep=' | ')

[                                                       * ]
[                                                   **  * ]
[                                      ***      **  *   * ]
[                      ****       ***  *    **  **  *   * ]
[         *****  ****  *     ***  **   *    **  *   *   * ]
[ ******, *    , **  , *   , ***, *  , *  , **, * , * , * ]

```

To have the separator in the list you must do


```
sage: p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11 = list(Partitions(6))
sage: ascii_art(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, sep=' | ')
                                                                *
                                                           **   *
                                           ***        **   *    *
                        ****         ***   *     **   **   *    *
         *****   ****   *      ***   **    *     **   *    *    *
****** | *     | **   | *    | *** | *   | *   | ** | *  | *  | *

```



2) the 'sep_baseline' keyword is ignored when the separators are not strings but AsciiArt objects themselves


```
sage: sep_line = AsciiArt(lines = [' | ' for _ in range(6)])
sage: part6_up = [ascii_art(part, baseline=len(part)) for part in Partitions(6)]
sage: p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11 = part6_up
sage: ascii_art(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, sep=sep_line, sep_baseline=6)
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
       |       |      |      |     |     |     |    |    |    |
******   *****   ****   ****   ***   ***   ***   **   **   **   *
         *       **     *      ***   **    *     **   **   *    *
                        *            *     *     **   *    *    *
                                           *          *    *    *
                                                           *    *
                                                                *

```

Since the intension of the ticket is to make the usage more comfortable you should think about the following extension which I have tried and which I display in the case of unicode:





```
diff --git a/src/sage/typeset/unicode_art.py b/src/sage/typeset/unicode_art.py
index dbdd028..c1bc878 100644
--- a/src/sage/typeset/unicode_art.py

     if kwds:
         raise ValueError('unknown keyword arguments: {0}'.format(list(kwds)))
     if len(obj) == 1:
-        return _unicode_art_factory.build(obj[0], baseline=baseline)
+        if type(obj[0]) ==  list and len(separator) > 0:
+            # soehms JAN 2017 (trac #24139): allow to apply separators to lists (instead of ",")
+            obj = obj[0]
+        else:
+            return _unicode_art_factory.build(obj[0], baseline=baseline)
     if not isinstance(separator, UnicodeArt):
         separator = _unicode_art_factory.build(separator, baseline=sep_baseline)
+    elif sep_baseline != None:
+        # soehms JAN 2017 (trac #24139): allow to apply sep_baseline to a given separator
+        from copy import copy
+        separator = copy(separator)
+        separator._baseline = sep_baseline
     obj = map(_unicode_art_factory.build, obj)
     return _unicode_art_factory.concatenate(obj, separator, empty_unicode_art,
                                             baseline=baseline)
```


Repeating the above tests with these changes gives:


```
sage: ascii_art(list(Partitions(6)), sep=' | ')

I actually agree with the behavior as is as otherwise you could not (naturally) create the ascii art of a list. Python has a way to expand the list by using `ascii_art(*Partitions(6), sep='|')`.

Thanks for the hint with respect to the docbuild. Unfortunately the pdf docbuild does not run through successfully on my system.
I guess I have some incompatible latex babel settings, since the building process stops to continue (but does not break) at `a_tour_of_sage` in other languages than English (hu is the first one, if you have a hint to this issue this would be great).

But of course, this has nothing to do with the unicode_art.
