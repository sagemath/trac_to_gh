Jori, is this a matter of code output or method name? If it is the latter, then I would say `is_self_dual` because otherwise it looks like there is a word "selfdual," which there is not.

Sorry for being unclear. It was the method name I wondered.

I'll make a patch to change the name of function of finite posets.
