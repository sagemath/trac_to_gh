I find this too complicated. Having Sage compilation depending on optional packages is awful.

For example, if I want to compile Sage with gmpy2 support I would have to do:
1. compile Sage
2. install gmpy2
3. recompile Sage

Not mentioning how impredictable this could be in doctesting.

Two steps are sufficient:

1. Install gmpy2
2. Compile Sage

Again, this is not different from existing optional packages.

`sage -i gmpy2` before `make`?

`importlib.import_module` is [almost undocumented](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/importlib.html), so I'm not convinced that it does the right thing.

On the other hand, `__import__` has [ample documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#__import__) so I know that it does what I want it to do.

And how does it handle relative imports in Python 2? That's not documented, but it is documented for `__import__`.

If I understand your point correctly, using `__import__` does not address the problem you're referring to in that comment.  E.g.

```
>>> import importlib, sys
>>> 'numpy' in sys.modules
False
>>> mod = __import__('numpy', {}, {}, [], 0)
>>> mod
<module 'numpy' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.pyc'>
>>> 'numpy' in sys.modules
True
```

This is because (traditionally) inserting the module into `sys.modules` is a job performed by the relevant module `Loader`.  The fact that that happens at all is in a lower level of abstraction than the `import` statement (which calls `__import__`).

`importlib.import_module` is a wrapper around `__import__` that just has more obvious semantics in terms of how dotted module names are handled, and is all around simpler.  The Python 3 docs recommend using it for this kind of purpose over `__import__`.

You're sounding sarcastic (intentional or not, I have no idea).

But the point is that documentation is important. The `import` statement maps directly to `__import__` and `__import__` is well documented. So I can be confident with using `__import__` here.

If you want to use `importlib` and want me to review that, then I will need to read the source code of `importlib`. That is not a disaster, but why should I be forced to do that?

No, actually, you don't; not any more than you need to read the source code of `__import__` itself.

I'll explain--I think the misunderstanding here is that `importlib` was originally added in Python 3, and small parts of it backported to Python 2.7 to aid with forward compatibility.  So in fact this function does work the same as documented in the current Python 3 docs (though it's implemented slightly differently).  The admonition in the more current docs still applies:  "**Note:** [`__import__`] is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming, unlike `importlib.import_module()`."

By all means, leave it as is--as you said it works.  I was just trying to help by pointing out a simpler way...
