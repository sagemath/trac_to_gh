In order to optionally include code depending on gmpy2, we introduce a compile-time Cython constant `HAVE_GMPY2`.

I find this too complicated. Having Sage compilation depending on optional packages is awful.

For example, if I want to compile Sage with gmpy2 support I would have to do:
1. compile Sage
2. install gmpy2
3. recompile Sage

Not mentioning how impredictable this could be in doctesting.

Two steps are sufficient:

1. Install gmpy2
2. Compile Sage

Again, this is not different from existing optional packages.

`sage -i gmpy2` before `make`?

`importlib.import_module` is [almost undocumented](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/importlib.html), so I'm not convinced that it does the right thing.

On the other hand, `__import__` has [ample documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#__import__) so I know that it does what I want it to do.

If I understand your point correctly, using `__import__` does not address the problem you're referring to in that comment.  E.g.

```
>>> import importlib, sys
>>> 'numpy' in sys.modules
False
>>> mod = __import__('numpy', {}, {}, [], 0)
>>> mod
<module 'numpy' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.pyc'>
>>> 'numpy' in sys.modules
True
```

This is because (traditionally) inserting the module into `sys.modules` is a job performed by the relevant module `Loader`.  The fact that that happens at all is in a lower level of abstraction than the `import` statement (which calls `__import__`).

`importlib.import_module` is a wrapper around `__import__` that just has more obvious semantics in terms of how dotted module names are handled, and is all around simpler.  The Python 3 docs recommend using it for this kind of purpose over `__import__`.

You're sounding sarcastic (intentional or not, I have no idea).

But the point is that documentation is important. The `import` statement maps directly to `__import__` and `__import__` is well documented. So I can be confident with using `__import__` here.

No, actually, you don't; not any more than you need to read the source code of `__import__` itself.
