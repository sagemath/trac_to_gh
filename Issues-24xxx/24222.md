A possible alternative to #24186, implementing simple conversion from C `char` arrays or `bytes` objects to `str` objects, and of `str` objects to `bytes` objects.  Here "`str`" and "`bytes`" are to be read exactly for either Python 2 or Python 3, so on Python 2 this means no conversion is performed since `str is bytes == True`.

One thing this does not do is implement any kind of conversion from Python 2 `unicode` objects to `bytes`.  This functionality might be worth adding, in some form, to `str_to_bytes`.  But this would add a *new* feature on Python 2, whereas for now I'm only trying to preserve the existing functionality on Python 2 exactly, while transparently supporting Python 3 `str`s everywhere that Python 2 `str`s are supported.

I don't see why you would pick `locale.getpreferredencoding()` as default encoding. Relevant encodings should be:

1. `ascii`. In many cases we know that output from a C library is an ASCII string (for example, the string representation of a number). Luckily, ASCII is compatible with most other encodings, so this isn't an issue.

4. `locale.getpreferredencoding()`. I believe that this is mainly relevant for subprocesses, provided that those subprocesses also look at the encoding.

For efficiency, I would rather have several sets of functions, each with a hard-coded encoding.

I would also suggest to implement these functions (or at least the functions where you care about performance) as `cdef inline` functions in the `.pxd` file. That way, they will actually be inlined when calling them from an external Cython module.

The Python 3 C API has specific functions to encode/decode for certainly particular encodings:
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#utf-8-codecs
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#locale-encoding
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#file-system-encoding

I haven't profiled, but I would hope that these are faster than the generic API.

Two more things:

1. it is safer to use the Cython-compile-time constant `PY_VERSION_HEX` instead of the C-compile-time constant `PY_MAJOR_VERSION`. It is dubious C code to write something like

```
if (0)
    nonexisting_function()
```
when `nonexisting_function()` doesn't actually exist like `PyUnicode_AsUTF8` on Python 2. The only reason that the above code compiles is compiler optimization.

See also #24215 for Cython-compile-time constants in general.

2. Could you move this to `sage/cpython/string.pxd`? I recently created the `sage/cpython` directory to deal with low-level Python internals and I think that these functions would fit there.

It's an unfortunate fact that there's isn't always one \"right answer\" here; the best we can do is provide sensible defaults *and* the ability for user-specified encoding where applicable; that is, where we know we want a specific encoding.  Moving forward we can also do more, for example, to ensure that any locale-aware code run by Sage is handled well.\n\nI could definitely agree to adding more encoding-specific helper functions, especially for ASCII and UTF-8.  But as a first pass, for the sake of getting Python 3 support off the ground, I'd prefer to leave this as is and then make adjustments as specific use cases arise.  It will be difficult to even find those specific use cases until and unless we get further along on getting Python 3 working in general (with these functions, plus a few other fixes I'll be posting soon, I've gotten the Sage doctest runner working, so that will help expose a lot of interesting cases *quickly*).\n\nI'll look at the rest of your suggestions; they seem reasonable.",

That's far too onerous and anxiety-provoking for the user :)  Python itself uses default encodings all over the place when in doubt (hence e.g. [PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault)).  It's an unfortunate fact that there's isn't always one "right answer" here; the best we can do is provide sensible defaults *and* the ability for user-specified encoding where applicable; that is, where we know we want a specific encoding.  Moving forward we can also do more, for example, to ensure that any locale-aware code run by Sage is handled well.

I could definitely agree to adding more encoding-specific helper functions, especially for ASCII and UTF-8.  But as a first pass, for the sake of getting Python 3 support off the ground, I'd prefer to leave this as is and then make adjustments as specific use cases arise.  It will be difficult to even find those specific use cases until and unless we get further along on getting Python 3 working in general (with these functions, plus a few other fixes I'll be posting soon, I've gotten the Sage doctest runner working, so that will help expose a lot of interesting cases *quickly*).

I'll look at the rest of your suggestions; they seem reasonable.

Nevermind; I see now that we explicitly pass that in to `cythonize` in the `setup.py`.  For that matter, any reason not to add simply `PY2` and `PY3` compile-time constants?  Comparing against `PY_VERSION_HEX` is a little annoying.

I had to get it working, in part, so that I could run the doctests for this module :)

It's explicit but not what you want. Cython always allows `None` to be passed as any type. If you really want `bytes` and not `None`, you need to check for it. And if you do an explicit check, there is no reason for the typing of the argument.

That's okay, I'm just going off experience here.  But it's a hazy topic so I don't mind having my assumptions challenged.

What's nice about having a sensible default is that, especially starting out, one needs to use a *lot* of these and it's not always immediately obvious what to do.  It's easier to not worry about it until you know you need to (e.g. something produces some text in an encoding you weren't expecting).

I'm still not following you here.  Dropping the type specification seems to make things worse, not better.  I do see what you're saying about `None` which is weird.  I don't like that.  But specifying the argument of the type provides some compile-time static checking that's already been helpful a few times.  It's not foolproof of course because in many cases Cython can't be sure what type a Python object will be.  But in cases where it can (e.g. something "obvious" like `foo = b'abc'; str_to_bytes(foo)`) you get:

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
    foo = b'abc'
    bar = str_to_bytes(foo)
                      ^
------------------------------------------------------------

Cannot convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly. This is not portable to Py3.
```

While this seems to be specific to bytes -> str, it is very useful in this case.

Also, without this type check you get much less useful errors if you pass in the wrong type.  With the type specification:

```
>>> str_to_bytes(b'a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Argument 's' has incorrect type (expected str, got bytes)
```

Without it

```
>>> str_to_bytes(b'a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sage/cpython/string.pxd", line 70, in sage.cpython.string.str_to_bytes (build/cythonized/sage/cpython/string.c:1660)

TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation
```

This error happens to be raising from `PyUnicode_EncodeLocale`, but one wouldn't guess that just from looking at it.  It seems sloppy.

One thing I did recently run into, however, is that `str_to_bytes(str s, ...)` does not allow subclasses of `str` which is inconvenient.  Your version does seem allow `str` subclasses (and I guess likewise `bytes` subclasses for `bytes_to_str`).

Feature, not a bug :-)

Cython uses this typing as an *optimization* tool, not as a *checking* tool. It happens to do some checking (like assigning `cdef str x = []` will fail) but that is just to avoid segfaults. For certain builtin types, Cython accesses the internals of those types. But accessing those internals is only valid for the exact type, it might not be valid for subtypes.

Yep, I just confirmed this myself--although it doesn't really make this explicit the way the code is written definitely implies that it's intentional.

Right.  It depends.  I feel like one should be able to ask for allowing subtypes explicitly though, if nothing else.  If Cython needs to muck around with the internals it can still make an "exact" check...

Okay--I'm really not happy about that--given that the `<str?>` syntax is the programmer explicitly asking for a type *check* it should allow some flexibility in how that's performed.  But that's a Cython issue.  I can live with this in the meantime. However, one thing that still needs to be fixed then is to remove the type checks in the Python 2 cases.
