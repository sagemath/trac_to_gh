A possible alternative to #24186, implementing simple conversion from C `char` arrays or `bytes` objects to `str` objects, and of `str` objects to `bytes` objects.  Here "`str`" and "`bytes`" are to be read exactly for either Python 2 or Python 3, so on Python 2 this means no conversion is performed since `str is bytes == True`.

One thing this does not do is implement any kind of conversion from Python 2 `unicode` objects to `bytes`.  This functionality might be worth adding, in some form, to `str_to_bytes`.  But this would add a *new* feature on Python 2, whereas for now I'm only trying to preserve the existing functionality on Python 2 exactly, while transparently supporting Python 3 `str`s everywhere that Python 2 `str`s are supported.

The Python 3 C API has specific functions to encode/decode for certainly particular encodings:
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#utf-8-codecs
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#locale-encoding
* https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html#file-system-encoding

I haven't profiled, but I would hope that these are faster than the generic API.

Two more things:

1. it is safer to use the Cython-compile-time constant `PY_VERSION_HEX` instead of the C-compile-time constant `PY_MAJOR_VERSION`. It is dubious C code to write something like

```
if (0)
    nonexisting_function()
```
when `nonexisting_function()` doesn't actually exist like `PyUnicode_AsUTF8` on Python 2. The only reason that the above code compiles is compiler optimization.

See also #24215 for Cython-compile-time constants in general.

2. Could you move this to `sage/cpython/string.pxd`? I recently created the `sage/cpython` directory to deal with low-level Python internals and I think that these functions would fit there.

I'm seeing now how wanting to have module-level global variables in conjunction with inline `c(p)def` functions in Cython gets problematic.  It just compiles them as `__Pyx_GetModuleGlobalName(name)`.  I feel like this should be a bug (I *think* not too difficult to fix?) in Cython, since it's really counter to how Python should work in this case.

For functions inlined from another module--at least if those functions access global variables from their original module--it should import that module during module initialization and use the correct module dict for globals lookups (just as normal Python functions do, basically).

That's an issue beyond this one though, so I'll rework things for now to get rid use of the global variables by these functions (I still want to have default encodings though).

But it's a hazy topic so I don't mind having my assumptions challenged.\n\nWhat's nice about having a sensible default is that, especially starting out, one needs to use a *lot* of these and it's not always immediately obvious what to do.  It's easier to not worry about it until you know you need to (e.g. something produces some text in an encoding you weren't expecting).

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A40):
> I owe you an apology... I read some Python docs and sources and it turns out that Python uses `locale.getpreferredencoding()` for more things than I thought. So with that in mind, `locale.getpreferredencoding()` might actually be a reasonable default after all.

That's okay, I'm just going off experience here.  But it's a hazy topic so I don't mind having my assumptions challenged.

What's nice about having a sensible default is that, especially starting out, one needs to use a *lot* of these and it's not always immediately obvious what to do.  It's easier to not worry about it until you know you need to (e.g. something produces some text in an encoding you weren't expecting).  The locale encoding is a good bet though since it will *typically* match what the terminal is using.

I'm still not following you here.  Dropping the type specification seems to make things worse, not better.  I do see what you're saying about `None` which is weird.  I don't like that.  But specifying the argument of the type provides some compile-time static checking that's already been helpful a few times.  It's not foolproof of course because in many cases Cython can't be sure what type a Python object will be.  But in cases where it can (e.g. something "obvious" like `foo = b'abc'; str_to_bytes(foo)`) you get:

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
    foo = b'abc'
    bar = str_to_bytes(foo)
                      ^
------------------------------------------------------------

Cannot convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly. This is not portable to Py3.
```

While this seems to be specific to bytes -> str, it is very useful in this case.

Also, without this type check you get much less useful errors if you pass in the wrong type.  With the type specification:

```
>>> str_to_bytes(b'a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Argument 's' has incorrect type (expected str, got bytes)
```

Without it

```
>>> str_to_bytes(b'a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sage/cpython/string.pxd", line 70, in sage.cpython.string.str_to_bytes (build/cythonized/sage/cpython/string.c:1660)

TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation
```

This error happens to be raising from `PyUnicode_EncodeLocale`, but one wouldn't guess that just from looking at it.  It seems sloppy.

One thing I did recently run into, however, is that `str_to_bytes(str s, ...)` does not allow subclasses of `str` which is inconvenient.  Your version does seem allow `str` subclasses (and I guess likewise `bytes` subclasses for `bytes_to_str`).

As you suggested earlier, using explicit type-checking casts like `PyUnicode_EncodeLocale(<str?>s, err)` gets part of the way there--it at least provides better exceptions when the wrong type is passed in.

Unfortunately in the case of `str` Cython wants to use `PyString_CheckExact`, instead of some more generic check, and this disallows `str` subclasses (even though for user-defined types it will use a check that allows subclasses).

Feature, not a bug :-)

Cython uses this typing as an *optimization* tool, not as a *checking* tool. It happens to do some checking (like assigning `cdef str x = []` will fail) but that is just to avoid segfaults. For certain builtin types, Cython accesses the internals of those types. But accessing those internals is only valid for the exact type, it might not be valid for subtypes.

Yep, I just confirmed this myself--although it doesn't really make this explicit the way the code is written definitely implies that it's intentional.

Right.  It depends.  I feel like one should be able to ask for allowing subtypes explicitly though, if nothing else.  If Cython needs to muck around with the internals it can still make an "exact" check...

I guess it depends on what you mean by "typing"--is this referring to Python types or C types?

Okay--I'm really not happy about that--given that the `<str?>` syntax is the programmer explicitly asking for a type *check* it should allow some flexibility in how that's performed.  But that's a Cython issue.  I can live with this in the meantime. However, one thing that still needs to be fixed then is to remove the type checks in the Python 2 cases.
