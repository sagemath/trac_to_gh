The "fix" is to use gcc 7.2, which compiles fplll just fine.

Strange. And GCC 7.2.0 did *not* fix the analogous problems with `pow()` for Singular?

No, it did not. 
But Singular's error with pow() is different (the only one that matters with gcc 7.2, anyway), there it's inability to use the templated pow() (failure to instantiate the template for `int pow(int,int)`)

And indeed Singular with gcc 7.2 does not need patches for floor() and sqrt(), only the pow() ones are needed.
