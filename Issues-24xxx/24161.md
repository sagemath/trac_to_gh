```
With the current version of Sage, we have:

```
sage: %timeit KostkaFoulkesPolynomial([4, 4, 2], [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])
100 loops, best of 3: 14.8 ms per loop
```
However, if we avoid creating conjugate partitions (and with some other tweaks), we get

```
sage: %timeit KostkaFoulkesPolynomial([4, 4, 2], [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])
100 loops, best of 3: 6.13 ms per loop
```

We also get a speedup using #24160.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Looks good.

Two details:

```
i = 0
```
is no longer needed. And

```
`ZZ['t']`
```
could be `\ZZ['t']`

Once done, you can set to positive.
