Hm, well, I thought you might say that. But the configuration of sage-the-distribution does also affect sagelib (configuration is somehow passed through); it does not just make one or the other version of python available for sagelib to find.

Also, in light of various efforts to use system packages when available I could imagine that one day sage-the-distribution could skip installing its copy of Python and then `--with-python3=/usr/bin/python3.5.77` would make sense.

> 
> Apart from this, there is also the unrelated Python-used-by-the-build-system which is a dependency. In fact, that is what we should use the `--with-python` option for.

For that one I would suggest something like `--with-build-python` to disambiguate.

First of all, I'd say `--with-python=2`  just looks odd to the trained configure-user's eye, one would expect to see `--with-python=python2` or perhaps `--with-python-version=2`.
And as I explained, `--with-python2` and `--with-python3`  allows for future, compatible extensions.

Not sure if the following will make sense, but perhaps a difference to BLAS is that Python exists as an executable. So `--with-python3=/usr/bin/python3.5.77` makes sense; whereas one would perhaps see `--with-blas=atlas --with-atlas-lib=/usr/lib/dfdkfldkflkdlfk --with-atlas-include=/usr/include/fjdkfjkdjfkjd`.
