Thanks for the hint. Is it better now? (I also made the version with `proof=False` return all the roots instead of only the isolated ones.)

I have doubts about the choice of refusing to run with `multiplicities=True`, any thoughts?

Yes.

Yes, it would probably be clearer to have a separate method for that case. But we could also simply return all the roots with multiplicity one (since, unless it was called with `proof=False`, the function always fails on multiple roots).

Unless someone objects, I suggest we keep the exception for now. It will be easier to change it later if it proves too inconvenient than to go the other way.

It is sad that the following is not working

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^3 + 3).roots(RBF, multiplicities=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

The variable `i` is implicit. Might be good to declare it as `size_t`.

Why did you decide to not include the while loop in the `try`/`finally`?

Done... But this is really a symptom of deeper design issues (of the documentation framework, and of the `_root_univariate_polynomial` mechanism)...

I have some work in progress to interface the `arb_fmpz_poly` module, but I'm waiting for some other tickets to get merged to avoid conflicts.

Why?
