Thanks for the hint. Is it better now? (I also made the version with `proof=False` return all the roots instead of only the isolated ones.)

I have doubts about the choice of refusing to run with `multiplicities=True`, any thoughts?

It looks reasonable to me (without having actually tested the code).

Is multiplicities=True the default? For an interval polynomial, returning certified root clusters would be a reasonable interpretation, although it's a bit dangerous since a user might expect (naively) to obtain the true multiplicities for the intended exact polynomial. It doesn't really matter right now since the algorithm in Arb doesn't support certifiable isolating all root clusters, anyway...

Yes, it would probably be clearer to have a separate method for that case. But we could also simply return all the roots with multiplicity one (since, unless it was called with `proof=False`, the function always fails on multiple roots).

Unless someone objects, I suggest we keep the exception for now. It will be easier to change it later if it proves too inconvenient than to go the other way.

You have included a lot of example but they are right now unreachable from the documentation. It would be better to have a sample of it directly in the generic `roots` method. It is good to advertise it at this generic level since someone might want to use this even with polynomial with integer coefficients.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^3 + 3).roots(CBF, multiplicities=False)
[[-1.442249570307408 +/- 3.83e-16] + [+/- 3.59e-19]*I,
 [0.7211247851537042 +/- 9.34e-18] + [1.249024766483406 +/- 4.80e-16]*I,
 [0.7211247851537042 +/- 9.30e-18] + [-1.249024766483406 +/- 4.80e-16]*I]
```

It is sad that the following is not working

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^3 + 3).roots(RBF, multiplicities=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: root finding for this polynomial not implemented
```

The variable `i` is implicit. Might be good to declare it as `size_t`.

Why did you decide to not include the while loop in the `try`/`finally`?

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A19):
> You have included a lot of example but they are right now unreachable from the documentation. It would be better to have a sample of it directly in the generic `roots` method. It is good to advertise it at this generic level since someone might want to use this even with polynomial with integer coefficients.

Done... But this is really a symptom of deeper design issues (of the documentation framework, and of the `_root_univariate_polynomial` mechanism)...

I have some work in progress to interface the `arb_fmpz_poly` module, but I'm waiting for some other tickets to get merged to avoid conflicts.

Why?

I don't know. Must have been because of the `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` block. But neither solution is perfect, I can move it in the `try` block if that's more to your taste.

To not let Cython decide what it should be... Maybe not important.
