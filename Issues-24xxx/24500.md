We change the internal API of `Action`: instead of the existing `_call_` method, we implement an `_act_` method which always takes `(g, x)` as arguments, where `g` is the acting element and `x` is the acted-on element.

The current implementation using `_call_` takes a left and right argument. This is less efficient because many actions can be left or right actions. This means that every `_call_` method needs to "decode" its arguments as `g` and `x`.

Work on #24247 shows that a significant amount of time is spent in `Action.__call__`. This ticket optimizes that quite a bit. It also adds documentation to `Action`.

Did you invert the “before” and “after” parts then?

On 8.2.beta4:

```

sage: a = AA(8); n = 1/3; timeit('a ^ n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 7 µs per loop
```
vs with #5574:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(4, impl="ntl"); n = 2; timeit('a ^ n', number=100000, repeat=20)

```
vs with #24500:

```

100000 loops, best of 20: 356 ns per loop

```

So I can explain why the first test is slower: there is an additional `if action._is_left` that is needed to be performed that previously was not there because powering could assume things in a specific order. The last one slowing down is due to #5574 (and some numerical noise). The middle two are almost identical (at least within the numerical noise I was getting), which is expected considering they perform the same number of checks in Cython.

However, I did get an improvement when something was calling `is_left()` in Python:

```
sage: from brial import BooleanMonomialMonoid
sage: P.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing(3)
sage: M = BooleanMonomialMonoid(P)
sage: x = M(x); xy = M(x*y); z=M(z); n=2
sage: timeit('x * n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.52 µs per loop
sage: timeit('n * x', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.43 µs per loop
```
vs with #24500

```
sage: timeit('n * x', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.14 µs per loop
sage: timeit('x * n', number=10000, repeat=20)
10000 loops, best of 20: 6.17 µs per loop
```

So my conclusion is this ticket does do a little bit of optimizing in certain cases and a regression in others. My current inclination is to give this ticket a positive review because it makes the action interface more clean by removing some of the implementation burden (i.e., deciding which input is which type). Do you agree with my assessment? Anyone else have any objections?
