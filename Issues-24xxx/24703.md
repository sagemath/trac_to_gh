Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.

The simplest solution is to make *every* package depend on the GCC executable. This way, a GCC upgrade will force everything to be rebuilt. This may be overkill, but it's not a big problem in practice since GCC is upgraded rarely (unlikely other Sage packages, it is never automatically rebuilt except if absolutely needed, see for example #24599).

 Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.
 
-The simplest solution is to make *every* package depend on GCC. This way, a GCC upgrade will force everything to be rebuilt. This may be overkill, but it's not a huge problem in practice since GCC is upgraded rarely (unlikely other Sage packages, it is never automatically rebuilt except if absolutely needed, see for example #24599).

I need to upgrade that patchbot.  It's running an old version of the patchbot package that has a bug when testing "unsafe" tickets.

Breaks full build on Debian 7 (both 32 and 64 bit)

PPL: 

```
configure: error: Cannot find GMP version 4.1.3 or higher.
GMP is the GNU Multi-Precision library:
see http://www.swox.com/gmp/ for more information.
When compiling the GMP library, do not forget to enable the C++ interface:
add --enable-cxx to the configuration options.
Error configuring the Parma Polyhedra Library.
```

Givaro:

```
checking for GMP library... yes
checking gmpxx.h usability... no
checking gmpxx.h presence... no
checking for gmpxx.h... no
your GMP does not have c++ support. Compile GMP with --enable-cxx
********************************************************************************

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A26):
> This also happens after backing out the ticket


I think it's a bug in the *previous* version of this ticket then.

> This is the second build of gcc


There shouldn't be a second build of gcc.

It would be very useful to see the auto-generated `build/make/Makefile` from the failed build to understand what is happening.

OK, I think I know what happened: there is indeed a serious bug that GCC is installed twice.

But that bug is not because of this ticket, it is most likely happening since #24599. I think you are just unlucky to hit this bug now and not before.

Really, you need to check both, with the caveat that if you installed with clang and want to switch to gcc you will break your install. So, unfortunately, a not so stupid user could break things.
