Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.

The simplest solution is to make *every* package depend on the GCC executable. This way, a GCC upgrade will force everything to be rebuilt. This may be overkill, but it's not a big problem in practice since GCC is upgraded rarely (unlikely other Sage packages, it is never automatically rebuilt except if absolutely needed, see for example #24599).

See [attachment:crash_zrVXNw.log] for a crash log from the arando i686 patchbot with Sage 8.2.beta5 using GCC 7.2.0. It involves brial and C++ strings.

The following doctests fail:

```
sage -t --warn-long 67.1 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --warn-long 67.1 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to abort

+Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.
 
+The simplest solution is to make *every* package depend on the GCC executable. This way, a GCC upgrade will force everything to be rebuilt. This may be overkill, but it's not a big problem in practice since GCC is upgraded rarely (unlikely other Sage packages, it is never automatically rebuilt except if absolutely needed, see for example #24599).
+
+---
+
+See [attachment:crash_zrVXNw.log] for a crash log from the arando i686 patchbot with Sage 8.2.beta5 using GCC 7.2.0. It involves brial and C++ strings.
+
+The following doctests fail:
+
+```
+sage -t --warn-long 67.1 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to abort
+sage -t --warn-long 67.1 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to abort

I need to upgrade that patchbot.  It's running an old version of the patchbot package that has a bug when testing "unsafe" tickets.

GMP is the GNU Multi-Precision library:

When compiling the GMP library, do not forget to enable the C++ interface:
add --enable-cxx to the configuration options.
