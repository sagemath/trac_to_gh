Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.

The simplest solution is to make *every* package depend on the GCC executable. This way, a GCC upgrade will force everything to be rebuilt. This may be overkill, but it's not a big problem in practice since GCC is upgraded rarely (unlikely other Sage packages, it is never automatically rebuilt except if absolutely needed, see for example #24599).

See [attachment:crash_zrVXNw.log] for a crash log from the arando i686 patchbot with Sage 8.2.beta5 using GCC 7.2.0. It involves brial and C++ strings.

The following doctests fail:

```

 Due to C++ ABI incompatibilities, problems occur if code built with earlier versions of GCC is linked against code built with newer versions of GCC. This leads for example to patchbot failures mentioned below.

Breaks full build on Debian 7 (both 32 and 64 bit)

PPL: 

```
configure: error: Cannot find GMP version 4.1.3 or higher.
GMP is the GNU Multi-Precision library:
see http://www.swox.com/gmp/ for more information.
When compiling the GMP library, do not forget to enable the C++ interface:
add --enable-cxx to the configuration options.
Error configuring the Parma Polyhedra Library.
```

Givaro:

```
checking for GMP library... yes
checking gmpxx.h usability... no
checking gmpxx.h presence... no
checking for gmpxx.h... no
your GMP does not have c++ support. Compile GMP with --enable-cxx

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A26):
> This also happens after backing out the ticket


I think it's a bug in the *previous* version of this ticket then.

> This is the second build of gcc


There shouldn't be a second build of gcc.

It would be very useful to see the auto-generated `build/make/Makefile` from the failed build to understand what is happening.

But that bug is not because of this ticket, it is most likely happening since #24599. I think you are just unlucky to hit this bug now and not before.

A question related to #24961: should we be checking that `x$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = xexists` or that `x$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = xyes`? On an OS X machine, I have Sage's gcc installed (from a few betas ago), but now Sage uses clang instead of gcc, so Sage's gcc will not be rebuilt as I upgraded Sage.

Really, you need to check both, with the caveat that if you installed with clang and want to switch to gcc you will break your install. So, unfortunately, a not so stupid user could break things.

Are you sure? If the GCC spkg is installed, it should be used by Sage. If this is not the case, I consider that a bug.

I don't see why, but maybe I'm missing something?

It won't be installed if it's already installed. Consider that a feature.
