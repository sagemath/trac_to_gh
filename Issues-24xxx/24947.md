This is actually fixed in #24742. Should I create a separate fix for just this issue or does anybody plan to review #24742?

Better to have a fix in an independent ticket (this one). #24742 is likely to take more time.

Actually #24918 is not merged in the new beta so that the patchbots are still useless.

Interestingly, this failure is caused by the combination of two merged tickets, each of which individually passed the testsuite. This is just to say that even a perfect patchbot cannot catch everything.

If I understand correctly, you added your commit on 11th of March, but the patchbot gets errors on 12th of March.

However, both tests failures that I see are in `test(interacts.statistics.coin)`, which apparently is unrelated with this ticket. And the commit looks good to me.
