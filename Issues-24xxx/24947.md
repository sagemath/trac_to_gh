Better to have a fix in an independent ticket (this one). #24742 is likely to take more time.

Actually #24918 is not merged in the new beta so that the patchbots are still useless.

If I understand correctly, you added your commit on 11th of March, but the patchbot gets errors on 12th of March.

However, both tests failures that I see are in `test(interacts.statistics.coin)`, which apparently is unrelated with this ticket. And the commit looks good to me.
