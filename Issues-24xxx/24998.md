Just try testing it on Python 3, I mean.  For example, this will break:

```
            v += [x for x in __builtins__.keys() if x[:n] == s] 
```

Actually the line is broken on Python 2 as well--there is no `__builtins__.keys()`.  Maybe it means `vars(__builtins__)`?  I'm not sure though.  I haven't read the code that closely.
