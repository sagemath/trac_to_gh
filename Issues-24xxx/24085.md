In the end, the fix was to edit jump labels in a (large) number of MPIR's asm files, and change the `.section` type of jumptables, while leaving `JMPENT` macros intact. The changes are way too big for Sage patches (and done against the master rather than against meanwhile a bit outdated 3.0.0 version), thus a new tarball.

this looks like a script. I meant: `cd $SAGE_ROOT/upstream; tar xf mpir-3.0.0.tar.gz; cd mpir-3.0.0; ./config.guess`

e.g. on my laptop I get the output
`skylakeavx-unknown-linux-gnu`

<a id='comment:26'></a>OK, now I see that on my machine MPIR with this patch fails standalone tests. :-(

That's probably why gcc can't be built (mpir is used )
Let me try few variations to see if I can make it work.

I can't help with the fix itself, but I'm happy to keep helping with testing.

Could you try out (the master of) https://github.com/dimpase/mpir.git ?
that is, 

```
git clone https://github.com/dimpase/mpir.git
cd mpir
./autogen.sh
./configure CC=cc --prefix=/tmp/blah && make -j8 && make -j8 check
```
(assuming you have `yasm` installed)
This fails 2 tests on non-skylake, perhaps it would work on skylake?

<a id='comment:44'></a>No problem!  Thanks for your work on this; debugging assembler without access to the architecture+OS sounds hard....

I could also have noticed that there was no new patch, but I'd just woken up. :-)

IMHO you might need to run `./configure` before running `make`. It could be that the install procedure got confused about the package versions...

The tarball worked for me on an installation of Sage, where I 
dropped it to upstream/, pulled the branch, and ran `./sage -f mpir` followed by make...

Hereby, in regard of allegations of fragrant tarball paperwork forgery, I invoke the 5th.

Whereas, there is no direct connection between Sage package numbers and versions of the library. Thus the tarball will pretend to be mpir 3.0.0, I think...

There are no patches to MPIR in the branch, they are indeed packaged in the tarball.
 
Tarballs are matched by `package-version.txt`, which gives you `VERSION`
in `tarball=mpir-VERSION.tar.bz2`, and checked for authenticity using sha1 and md5.

Oh, I misunderstood you: I thought you meant pull from the mpir repo.  I did pull the branch on this ticket, so I'm using the correct tarball.

If I try this `b=a.exp()` at the Sage prompt it keeps running seemingly forever.
Perhaps knowing concrete values (not random `a`) to test would help here...

If I use `10^5` instead of `10^6` in the definition of `R`, it still seems to return in about 10 sec.

<a id='comment:69'></a>The tarball has been made from https://github.com/dimpase/mpir/commit/65bb82fdf65765e6edfbbbf8edb47c726413b8da
(now merged in https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/pull/234)
by following (already outdated, as Billa says) https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/commit/1b3d5976292c6308c3f121c5ea2c406da0324bc8
and running `make dist`.

Bill is planning a new release, I gather.

1. What does "made from X by following Y mean"?

2. Can you please document this in `SPKG.txt` or somewhere where people will find it?

Fine for me, but how you expect people to know this?

I don't mind custom tarballs, as long as it is absolutely clear what is going on.

because my patches are not against mpir 3.0.0, they are against last week's master.
And there is a hundred of commits in between, and also 3.0.0 is a different branch, in fact.
I tried created a patch against 3.0.0, but it would have been magabytes in size and a lot of time to create.

You mean the files edited on that commit? Most of that seems to be related to changing the version number. That shouldn't be needed here.

You mean `autogen.sh`? But Bill says (in a comment on that commit) that this might not work...

In that case, it can serve even less as documentation.

Why would running `git diff commit1 commit2` take a lot of time?

And why would it be so large? Are there any auto-generated files in the git repo?

because many patches created this way do not apply to the 3.0.0 branch.
And there was about 80 patches to look at.
I have better things to do than manually deal with 80 non-applying patches.

I don't understand. We need to bump up version numbers of the package, and of the libraries built.

Oh Holy Jesus, I have done a job. It is a unique one-off job, why do you want a full
documentation of the process? Nobody won't need to redo it, ever.
A new way of making MPIR releases is underway.

I see at least these issues:

(A) you could have done some wrong in creating the tarball, subtly breaking it somehow. Usually, when I review a ticket creating a custom tarball, then checking the tarball distribution process is part of the review because things can go wrong there.

(B) distros will not be happy to package this unofficial version of MPIR (see [ODK D3.10](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/59)). If the changes only involve Skylake support, then there is no issue here. However, you seem to imply that there are a lot of other unrelated changes too.

That wasn't so hard. I put those instructions in a `spkg-src` script and created a new tarball using that script.

Please review.

OK, sorry - I actually did it the other way around:
removed directories and edited the dist target of the makefile
and ran make dist only then. I didn't notice they don't package mpir.net.

We typically do not change `.so` version numbers if we patch. And the difference between adding a patch or using a new tarball is purely technical. So if we don't change versions for patches, we shouldn't change the version number for this either.
