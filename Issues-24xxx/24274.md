This seems to cause problems with fricas (see patchbot) likely due to no longer catching an `AttributeError` (it's a little too late in the evening in Australia for me to think enough to find the exact problem, but I will do so tomorrow).

I'm afraid that the fricas issues are more fundamental. They appear on other tickets too for the same patchbot.
