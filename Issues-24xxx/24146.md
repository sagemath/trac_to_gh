ppl does not do integer LPs, if I recall right.

Is this the real Dima?

Ppl does have a MIP solver. Some time back I added the missing parts to the Sage ppl interface. Your recollection is probably based on the state of things before that.

It is also bad that this is not interruptible, but that is a separate issue. However, isn't this a problem with upstream (i.e. PPL) rather than Sage? At least, using the GLPK solver, I get `-8.0`.
