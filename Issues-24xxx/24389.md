There's still kind of a bug here, though not really originating from this ticket (it only started here because the `entrypoints` package was upgraded).

The problem is that our entrypoints package has a custom `setup.py` that imports from the package itself at build/install time.  This fails if the build directory's permissions are not proper due to Jeroen's patch to Python that disallows `''` to be in `sys.path`.
