Hello! According to https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.8, DOIs should be linked to `https://doi.org/`, rather than `http://dx.doi.org/`. Since there are many static DOI links and some code that generates new ones, please consider updating both.

I PR's this to https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide/pull/3 as an example, and because that repo was not head-lined with "NO PRs".
