In many ways, the better solution would be to convert this to inherit from `ClonableArray`, although we initially wanted to implement a faux-equality with lists because other combinatorial objects also did this. I don't particularly see a reason to actually keep this.

TL;DR This works as for now, and I should do a proper fix later.
