`GF(p).extension(xxx)` does not accept symbolic polynomials... and the error is cryptic

```
sage: Fp = GF(3)
sage: Fp2.<i> = Fp.extension(x^2+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'E' referenced before assignment
```

We make it more user friendly by allowing the above in some duck typing fashion.

Should this ducktyping really all be happening under the hood without notifying the user? I think a more readable error message would be better, or at least a warning. We don't want people to use SR for polynomials in their code, do we?

Also, is this

```

+                    modulus = modulus.change_ring(self)
```
necessary? The `GF` constructor already does `modulus = R(modulus).monic()`, where R = PolynomialRing(FiniteField(p), 'x').
