That is not an MPFR bug at all. It's just because you have the old MPFR and new MPFR installed. Some libraries that GCC links against are using the old MPFR and some are using the new MPFR. The solution is to recompile GCC.

That being said, we should still upgrade to 4.0.1 but it won't fix your library versioning issues.

You're right, thanks for the correction, although I was puzzled by seeing the error messages pointing to Sage's copy of MPC. I was able to build Sage by switching to gcc-7.

I don't know if it's likely to cause trouble in real computations, but it did break Arb's test suite (which is how it was discovered). In any case, it makes sense to do the upgrade sooner rather than later.
