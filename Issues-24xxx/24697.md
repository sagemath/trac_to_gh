Replying to [ticket:24697 fredrik.johansson]:
> In fact, I'm currently unable to build recent branches of Sage due to a getting an MPFR assertion error in gcc when building giac.

That is not an MPFR bug at all. It's just because you have the old MPFR and new MPFR installed. Some libraries that GCC links against are using the old MPFR and some are using the new MPFR. The solution is to recompile GCC.

You're right, thanks for the correction, although I was puzzled by seeing the error messages pointing to Sage's copy of MPC. I was able to build Sage by switching to gcc-7.

> If the error in mpfr_div is serious, this should be a blocker.

I don't know if it's likely to cause trouble in real computations, but it did break Arb's test suite (which is how it was discovered). In any case, it makes sense to do the upgrade sooner rather than later.
