At the moment with `solve(...,algorithm='sympy')` the SymPy function `solveset` is called for single expressions, and `solve` for systems. However, it turns out that `solve` can handle some single-expression tasks where `solveset` fails. This ticket should add code that analyzes `solveset` output and calls `solve` in case no solution was found. This probably includes simplifying the returned `ConditionSet`s.

Possibilities:
- translate SymPy's result if possible to list or dict notation; if not possible leave it as is. Disadvantages are that new classes are introduced from SymPy.
- translate SymPy's result to a `sage.set` and then, if possible, to list or dict notation; if not possible leave it as `sage.set`. This would make it necessary to improve `sage.set` with at least image sets and complex regions.
- always translate SymPy's result to a `sage.set` like above, making set notation the default even for the Maxima solver.

A further problem is that output is different between SymPy's `solve` and `solveset`. The relation/boolean notation of `solve` can be translated to set notation for the reals however (see #24156).

Replying to [rws](#comment%3A2):
> `ConditionSet` is a AND-combination of a relation and a set, so this can be translated into list format too if the set is finite/interval.


Not so, it is a AND-combination of a relation and an element statement, i.e. symbol in set. This means it cannot be expressed in list format.

As an example this result set from SymPy:

```
In [9]: solveset(abs(x) - n, x, S.Reals)
Out[9]: ([0, ∞) ∩ {n}) ∪ ((-∞, 0] ∩ {-n})
```
is with #24156 and #24171 constructible in Sage:

```
sage: from sage.sets.set import Set_object_union, Set_object_intersection
sage: _ = var('n')
sage: Set_object_union(Set_object_intersection(RealSet(x>=0),Set([n])), Set_obje
....: ct_intersection(RealSet(x<=0),Set([-n])))
Set-theoretic union of Set-theoretic intersection of [0, +oo) and {n} and Set-theoretic intersection of (-oo, 0] and {-n}
```
