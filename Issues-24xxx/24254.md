`Parent.is_coercion_cached` and `Parent.is_conversion_cached` are:
- not documented
- trivial (`return domain in self._coerce_from_hash`)
- useless for most users
- appear in one place in the code of `catgories.unital_algebras.UnitalAlgebras` and two doctests

This ticket stands for hiding them (ie let their name starts with an underscore) and document them.
