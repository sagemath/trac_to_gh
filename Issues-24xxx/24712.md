Building clang/clang-runtime on Gentoo with "-default-compiler-rt" and "-compiler-rt -sanitize" fixes the problem as it now uses bits of gcc to provide those functions.
I think it is a bug somewhere in the clang install as those symbols (which are not requested by mpfr) shouldn't be generated when using clang's compiler-rt.

needless to say, mpfr's selftests fail with this error too.
The workaround (found [here](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2018/02/05/msg026238.html)) is to configure mpfr with `--disable-float128` flag, at least in the openbsd case.
