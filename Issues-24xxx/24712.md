<a id='comment:2'></a>Building clang/clang-runtime on Gentoo with "-default-compiler-rt" and "-compiler-rt -sanitize" fixes the problem as it now uses bits of gcc to provide those functions.
I think it is a bug somewhere in the clang install as those symbols (which are not requested by mpfr) shouldn't be generated when using clang's compiler-rt.
