Let `L` an integer quadratic lattice and `M` its Gram matrix. For a non-zero integer `d` we could define `L(d)` as the lattice with intersection matrix `dM`.
If `d=1` it creates just a new lattice with a standard basis.

The basis should be preserved. -> Just the ambient module/vector space changes.
I would suggest a different name. 
How about `scale` ?

So here are some reasons why the basis should be preserved:

Say, I have lattice `L` and computed a lot of data, for example sublattices, the automorphism group, something in the discriminant form etc..
All of this is represented with respect to the coordinates of the ambient module / or the basis. If we change that, it is hard to transfer information from a lattice to its scaled counterpart. But if the bases are equal - it is very easy.

The code is just a few lines:

```
def scale(self, s):
    n = self.degree()
    inner_product_matrix = s * self.inner_product_matrix()
    ambient = FreeQuadraticModule(self.base_ring(), n, inner_product_matrix)
    return FreeQuadraticModule_integer_symmetric(ambient=ambient, basis=self.basis(), inner_product_matrix=inner_product_matrix)
```

I still think that there are more practical situations where you need a lattice with a new standard basis. Maybe we could put it as an option?

```
def scale(self, s, new_basis=true):
    if (new_basis):
        return IntegralLattice(s*self.gram_matrix()) 
    else:
        n = self.degree()
        inner_product_matrix = s * self.inner_product_matrix()
        ambient = FreeQuadraticModule(self.base_ring(), n, inner_product_matrix)
        return FreeQuadraticModule_integer_symmetric(ambient=ambient, basis=self.basis(), inner_product_matrix=inner_product_matrix)

In fact the gram matrix must be integral - not the inner product matrix. So I guess I would opt against rational scaling - it is not as natural as integer scaling.
Btw. there still seems to be a problem with the documentation - the patchbot failed.

Twist is even a better name than scale. 
Actually what we do is as a tensor product between lattices, where the integer 'd' represents the lattice <d>. Maybe what we can do is allowing it in general.

Yes, we can left "twist" as name.
Something like:

Inner_product_matrix = self.inner_product_matrix().tensor_product(other.inner_product_matrix())

basis_matrix = self.basis_matrix().tensor_product(other.basis_matrix())
