Let `L` an integer quadratic lattice and `M` its Gram matrix. For a non-zero integer `d` we could define `L(d)` as the lattice with intersection matrix `dM`.
If `d=1` it creates just a new lattice with a standard basis.

<a id='comment:5'></a>So here are some reasons why the basis should be preserved:

Say, I have lattice `L` and computed a lot of data, for example sublattices, the automorphism group, something in the discriminant form etc..
All of this is represented with respect to the coordinates of the ambient module / or the basis. If we change that, it is hard to transfer information from a lattice to its scaled counterpart. But if the bases are equal - it is very easy.

The code is just a few lines:

```
def scale(self, s):
    n = self.degree()
    inner_product_matrix = s * self.inner_product_matrix()
    ambient = FreeQuadraticModule(self.base_ring(), n, inner_product_matrix)
    return FreeQuadraticModule_integer_symmetric(ambient=ambient, basis=self.basis(), inner_product_matrix=inner_product_matrix)
```
