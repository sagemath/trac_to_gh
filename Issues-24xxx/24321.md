Division on an elliptic curve over C does not seem to be implemented. Currently the answers are all completely wrong.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(CC,[1,0])
sage: Q = E.lift_x(-3.3)
sage: P = 2*Q
sage: P.division_points(2)
[]
sage: Q.division_points(3)
[]
sage: E([0,0]).division_points(3)
[(0.000000000000000 : 0.000000000000000 : 1.00000000000000)]
```

I doubt many people will want to do that, but it should not produce wrong results.
