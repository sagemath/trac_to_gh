Where we are now is that the right flags seem to be

```
export CC="clang"
export CXX="clang++ --stdlib=libc++"
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS --stdlib=libc++"
export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -lc++ --stdlib=libc++"
```
The stdlib directive is needed on all three variables because 1. without it in CXX several packages ignore CXXFLAGS and so it's not applied with clang++ (the compiler), 2. CXXFLAGS um well it belongs there, and 3. without it in LDFLAGS several packages link with libstdc++ (fpylll, sagelib).

Problem is #24705 and #24710.

Actually I also need to add `-I/usr/include/libcxxabi/` for otherwise brial won't find a certain header (on my computer at least).
