Long ago I planned to build a class for reverse plane partitions once the tableaux class was overhauled (#17983). But the overhaul project never got finished, and I will probably not have much to add to it in foreseeable time.

The purpose of this ticket is to create a bare-bones class for reverse plane partitions (output is highly encouraged about what this class should be able to do and what it should inherit from!). Then, we want to implement the Hillman-Grassl correspondence and Sulzgruber's alternative bijection (arXiv:1612.03922v2).

<a id='comment:2'></a>We've implemented the Hillman-Grassl correspondence and its inverse. So far this is separate from the class hierarchy and just a bunch of functions. We are also lacking Sulzgruber's, Pak's and Hopkins's variants.

How would you embed this into the classes? Or wait until Tableaux have been refactored?

Also, I have no idea if the doc works...

<a id='comment:17'></a>You do not need the `WeakRPPs.__classcall_private__` as it just calls the "base" method (in the classcall sense).

Some other comments:

- It is not good to use abbreviations in class names: `RPP` -> `ReversePlanePartitions`.
- For the qualifier "weak", do you expect there to be a good use for "strong" RPPs? If not, then I think we should keep it simple and remove "weak".
- lazy import things:
  {{{#!diff
from .hillman_grassl import WeakRPP, WeakRPPs, hillman_grassl, hillman_grassl_inverse, pak_correspondence, sulzgruber_correspondence
lazy_import("sage.combinat.hillman_grassl", ["WeakRPP", "WeakRPPs", "hillman_grassl", "hillman_grassl_inverse", "pak_correspondence", "sulzgruber_correspondence"]
  }}}
- I do not see any benefit to adding the bijections to the global namespace since they are accessible via `Tableau` and `WeakRPP`, which are their only input formats. They are also too specialized IMO to be added to the global namespace. There's a bit of a case to be made for Pak/Sulzgruber, but at this point, I am not certain it is for the best to have them as global functions.
- Having the module level explanations of everything means you cannot see the definitions in the interactive doc (i.e., via `?`), plus it looses some granularity (c.f., you added section headers). I think it would be more useful to have this in each user entry point, e.g., in `Tableau.hillman_grassl()`.
- Paranoia: I would raw-string `r"""` the new methods to `Tableau`.
- Micro-optimization: Faster to do `if not M:` than `if len(M) == 0:`.
