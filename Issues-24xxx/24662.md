1133/1133 Test #1133: applications-polyscip-tenfelde_podehl ............................................................   Passed    0.10 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1133
```

this is a system install with pretty much the same stuff configured than you (optional: zlib, readline, gmp[real gmp not mpir] and bliss - no ipopt or criterion).

I note that I have more tests than you (???).

In your log, the zlib identified in the tests is the one from sage (1.2.11) while the one spotted at configuration time was the system one (1.2.8) - that certainly could spell trouble.

Running tests after install really hurts. In any case you shouldn't have to do anything special to use the installed version of `scip` unless the testsuite has been badly written. cmake know to have different runtime path for tests and install.
