In Sage 8.1.rc0, the command `sage --notebook=export` (default for `sage --notebook`) fails with

```
[C 14:16:56.066 NotebookApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[C 14:16:56.066 NotebookApp] The 'nbserver_extensions' trait of a NotebookApp instance must be a dict, but a value of type 'list' (i.e. ['sagenb_export.nbextension']) was specified.
```
(see attached file for full log).

Both `sage --notebook=jupyter` and `sage --notebook=sagenb` are OK though. 

This is on Ubuntu 16.04 and ahs been reported at 
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/7-eKF-xN0p0/z3T5zeMhAQAJ

NB: everything is OK with Sage 8.1.beta8, so the issue is most certainly due to a change introduced in Sage 8.1.beta9 or 8.1.rc0.

Sorry for messing this up...

I usually run `./sage -n jupyter`, so that is why I did not notice this.
