[Thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe) is a javascript library to turn static HTML pages into live documents where code cells can be edited and executed. Thebe was been introduced in #20690 as a replacement for the live documentation feature of sagenb. It covers the use case of browsing the documentation through the Jupyter notebook; in this case, Thebe connected to that notebook for computations.

However this model was not sustainable:
- Shipping Thebe is additional burden for Sage's maintainers and packagers
- Thebe is a fork of the Jupyter code base and thus not maintainable.
- In practice, Thebe got out of sync and soon became incompatible with the Jupyter we shipped. So the feature was lost.

Meanwhile, Thebe has been reimplemented as [ThebeLab](https://github.com/minrk/thebelab), a thin layer on top of JupyterLab, making it much more sustainable. In addition, an online computation backend is now available thanks to http://mybinder.org and Sage's docker container.

In this ticket, we switch gear, and focus on the use case of browsing the documentation from anywhere (within Jupyter, local static documentation, Sage's online documentation), with the assumption of an internet connection.

Implementation:
- When compiling the documentation, Sphinx adds a small header to the produced static html pages.
- If a page contains a sage code cell, an Activate button is added.
- Upon activation, and only then, the thebelab javascript library together with its dependencies in the jupyterlab javascript library are fetched from the web.
- Thebe is configured to use Sage's docker container on MyBinder as computation backend.

Bonus:
- Get rid of Thebe's package.
- A few bells and whistles of the new Thebe implementation (status field, ...)
- #21680 can be closed

The feature has been tested for a couple months on 
[More SageMath Tutorials](http://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/). It's also configured by default for any Sage package that uses [sage-package](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-package); see e.g. [this page](http://sage-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sage_package/sphinx-demo.html).

We believe that dropping the use case of offline browsing while having a notebook running (which is broken anyway) is largely compensated by the much easier maintenance and the availability of the feature for all deployments of Sage's documentation.

I am not sure to completely understand how the whole stuff work, here are some questions:

- The thebelab javascript is provided by a CDN (namely `unpkg.com`), and since the version is hardcoded in the link, if there is an upgrade of thebelab, there will be an update within Sage source code as well, so why not providing the javascript locally (by packaging thebelab), and avoid this remote intermediary ?

- The work of forking jupyterlab to extract the thebe-like part was done already by thebelab. Why not using that interesting part locally and use the running jupyter instance instead of mybinder ?

- How could a user running the doc from her Sage installation be sufficiently warned that, while a Sage kernel is currently running on her machine, the code will however be executed remotely ?

- mybinder FAQ explicitly states * You shouldn't do anything on mybinder.org that you wouldn't mind sharing with the world! * see https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-push-data-from-my-binder-session-back-to-my-repository How is this issue addressed since the goal of live documentation is precisely that the user will modify the cells with stuff she wants to try ?

- The local documentation depends on the version of Sage (e.g. existence of some method, option, ...), hence there must be a corresponding kernel on mybinder:
  - How is the local Sage version transmitted to mybinder so that the correct kernel is launched remotely ?
  - This require a frequent updates on the mybinder machines (one at each release). Who takes the responsibility of long-term maintenance of remote kernels ?

- What is the point of having this into Sagemath source code if Sagemath can not run it, as it requires remote servers to work anyway ? Why not instead maintaining a `livedoc.sagemath.org` service ? This would be more consistent and understandable from a user perspective.

- Is it possible to disable this feature when building Sage documentation (as we did for the plot directive) ?

- [this one is sarcastic] shall we consider having `sage --notebook` open a webpage redirecting to some cocalc or any similar centralized, bandwidth consuming, earth warming, privacy harming, open-source alternative ?

Hi everyone,

Thanks for the thoughtfull comments. I am done with teaching for the
week, and can finally come back to this.

I realized I forgot to state the obvious: yes, when possible, using a
locally running jupyter would be preferable for computations for all
the aforementionned reasons (use of resources, privacy, consistency
with the locally installed kernel, ...).

But this requires some additional work:
1. packaging thebelab
2. packaging jupyterlab
3. implementing the logic: "am I being served by a Jupyter server? If yes, connect there; otherwise offer binder as backup".
4. making sure that the jupyterlab client code is compatible with the Jupyter server we are running

I therefore aimed for a strategy in two stages:
- Implement something simple for now, put it in production, and assess how robust this is
- Add support for using a local Jupyter server when available

Additional motivations:
- the use of the local jupyter by our previous Thebe setup was broken
  anyway, This ticket tackles the most urgent: reinstating the feature
  in most use cases.
- we might as well wait for Sage to upgrade from Jupyter to JupyterLab
  before implementing the second step, to save on 2. and 4.

What do you think?

Now to more specific points:

> - The thebelab javascript is provided by a CDN (namely `unpkg.com`),
>   and since the version is hardcoded in the link, if there is an
>   upgrade of thebelab, there will be an update within Sage source
>   code as well, so why not providing the javascript locally (by

The link is actually using semantic versioning (that's the `^` in
`thebelab@^0.1.0`). So it will fetch the latest version of thebelab
whose API is meant to be backward compatible.


> - The work of forking jupyterlab to extract the thebe-like part was
>   done already by thebelab.

Just for clarification: it's not a fork. thebelab is using the vanilla
jupyterlab as a library.

> - How could a user running the doc from her Sage installation be
>   sufficiently warned that, while a Sage kernel is currently running
>   on her machine, the code will however be executed remotely ?

Yes, that's an important point. The tooltip explains this. Do you have
specific suggestions? We could e.g. easily change the Activate button
title or the messages that appear when it get pressed.

> - mybinder FAQ explicitly states '' You shouldn't do anything on
>   mybinder.org that you wouldn't mind sharing with the world! '' see
>   https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-push-data-from-my-binder-session-back-to-my-repository
>   How is this issue addressed since the goal of live documentation

>   wants to try ?

The live documentation, is mostly meant for casually toying with small
variations of the existing examples; this sounds unlikely to leak
private information. That being said, yes, the user should be well
aware of what's happening in case she would want to play harder.

> - This require a frequent updates on the mybinder machines (one at

The bulk of the work is to update the docker container, which have
many other use cases anyway. This is mostly automated. Erik and Julian
are working on fully automatizing this, toward including this in the
release process.

Beyond this, there remains on trivial item: updating the label in:

    https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env/blob/master/Dockerfile

I am happy to volunteer on that for the next couple years :-)


> alternative the livedoc.sagemath.org approach

Our users browse the Sage documentation in many ways: on
doc.sagemath.org, through the notebook's Help menu, or browsing
directly the local html pages, or a copy of them on their department
page. With this ticket (and admittedly assuming internet), the user
can make the documentation live right where he is. Forcing her/him to
navigate to a parallel set of documentation pages is only making
things more complicated. And breaks the flow of reading.

Besides this would also forces us to setup and maintain a new service.

> - Is it possible to disable this feature when building Sage
>   documentation (as we did for the plot directive) ?

It should be doable, but I don't necessarily see the point. Except for
the 10 lines of javascript/css to setup the button, nothing happens
unless the user explicitly presses the activate button: no connection
to binder, no thebelab download, no network activity of any form.

> About thebelab and the Sage cell server

That's a real question, as there is much overlap between the two
projects. We actually discussed this with Jason Grout last week.

ThebeLab, like Jupyter, is language agnostic and targets a much much
wider community than the Sage cell server. It's therefore likely to
get more traction in the long run, in terms of users, developers, and
computing resources. It can also use any Jupyter server (a local
jupyter, a jupyterhub, binder, ...) that the user has credentials for.

The Sage cell server on the other hand is much more advanced when it
comes to performance. For example, when used with binder, a full new
jupyter ends up being started each time, rather than just spawning a
new kernel, or even forking an existing one.

I would love to see a convergence between the two projects, with the
cool features and ideas of the Sage cell server being ported over to
ThebeLab (or presumably down the stack into Jupyter/JupyterHub). Kind
of what happened with the Sage notebook and Jupyter.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

I don't know for sure. Since the project has been revamped a couple months ago, Binder seems to scale relatively well. There are several ongoing efforts as well to add more deployements (like  [this one](http://binderhub.fedcloud-tf.fedcloud.eu/) on the "EU  cloud") though they are not federated yet.

> * How long can a session run, i.e. if there are several linked cells, how long can one wait after executing the first one before executing the last one?

I would need to check on the binder docs.

I remember beeing really annoyed by Sage's live documentation that would loose its history in the middle of my lectures. But I have changed workflow and haven't used ThebeLab enough to have a feeling on whether this could become annoying for a typical usage.

Thanks for investigating this. Yes, having this work on
doc.sagemath.org is one of the big point.

The new implementation consists of a couple lines of javascript and
css, which just assume standard internet connection to further fetch
thebelab's javascript from a cdn and connect to binder. This worked
without special action on ReadTheDoc. See e.g.:

        http://sage-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sage_package/sphinx-demo.html

Do you foresee anything specific in the doc.sagemath.org setup that
could break that? If useful, I can provide with a tiny tarball with
one example page and the js and css to be temporarily deployed in a
corner of docs.sagemath.org for testing.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas

No, there is nothing weird going on. It's just static files hosted on the "fastly" CDN.

I think it should be much more clear that a remote server will be used and, perhaps, a different version of Sage. How about some dialog window with this information that appears when "Activate" is pressed? Perhaps with a checkbox "Don't show this again". Relying on users reading tooltips is unreliable...

Dialog windows are a bit of a bother for users. I had a look at how you handle the same issue in SageMatCell. I like the "Help" and "About" links. A further improvement would be to have those links along the run button rather than at the end of the output: first to see them before actually pressing button, and also to save on vertical space.

This would need to be done upstream in Thebe though; I'll post a feature request there. It's also somewhat more complicated than for the [SageMathCell](../wiki/SageMathCell) since there can be many possible configurations, and the message or page linked to should reflect that.

In the mean time, one easy thing to do would be to adapt the status messages that are displayed in the status field that replaces the Activate button. Currently it shows:
- building
- launching
- ready

We could make it into something like:
- Setting up Thebe
- Connecting to mybinder.org
- Connected to mybinder.og

where mybinder.org would be a clickable link.

What do you think? Suggestions for better wording?

Vincent: I believe this is what we had agreed upon, right?

**Questionable point**

As a new package, should the thebelab spkg be standard
or optional? Officially we should wait one year; however it replaces
an existing package, and it should be rather failsafe (a simple js file
to be installed by jupyter); also, up to the dependency upon on the
network, the live doc would still work without it.

What do you think?

**Timing**

when browsing the doc through Jupyter, it takes 4s on my machine from pressing the Activate button to displaying the first output.

For reference:

I made a quick experiment of a semi-automatic notebook emulating
a static web page for testing whether thebelab
works; it does not require the documentation to be compiled.
See attached file (contains usage instructions).
Maybe it could eventually be fully automated and integrated in our test suite.

Hi Nicolas,

Sorry to have not worked on this! Too busy at MathExp and now I need to take care about my moving from Bordeaux.

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment:38):
> Vincent: I believe this is what we had agreed upon, right?

Looks like it! Though I am unsure about the 100% availability without internet. I will try.

For what and why should we wait one year? If it fixes issues it is fine to make it standard from now. Though this has to be discussed on sage-devel.

4s in which mode (local or mybinder)? Starting a Jupter worksheet is much faster, most of the time is spent in starting Sage (1.5secs).

I considered this, but then dropped the idea after reading the dev guide: we are indeed not
changing the upstream sources:
```
The spkg-src file is optional and only to document how the upstream tarball was changed. Ideally it is not modified, then there would be no spkg-src file present either.
```

Is your argument that building a tarball is a change by itself to the upstream sources?
Then, yeah, sure, we could do that.

This is not acceptable:

```
To upgrade the sources to a new version:

    THEBELAB_VERSION=0.2.1
    echo $THEBELAB_VERSION > package-version.txt
    mkdir src
    wget https://unpkg.com/thebelab@\^$THEBELAB_VERSION -O src/thebelab.js
    tar -jcvf thebelab-$THEBELAB_VERSION.tar.bz2 src
    rm  src/thebelab.js; rmdir src
    mv thebelab-$THEBELAB_VERSION.tar.bz2 ../../../upstream
    sage --package fix-checksum
```
If you really require a special script for generating the source tarball (why?), then it should be a `spkg-src` file. See `build/pkgs/glpk/spkg-src` for a good example.

Sorry for that, I didn't intend that.

Please ask him. There are also the github tarballs (https://github.com/minrk/thebelab/releases), would that work?

Brief update after talking to min: thebelab is being distributed through npm, and
a tarball can be obtained from:

Because it's the source tarball for thebelab. Oh, but actually there is a lib subdirectory which contained the webpacked's javascript file; I had missed that. So we could actually use it.

> There also seems to be a version mismatch: on the ticket, you posted `thebelab-0.2.1.2.tgz` (I assume created using `spkg-src`) but in the branch, there is version 0.2.1

That was just me running through hoops to replace an existing file ... Anyway we don't need it any more.
