Refactor `IntegerMulAction` in preparation for #24247:

1. Add an abstract base class `IntegerAction` which will also be used to implement `IntegerPowAction` in #24247.

2. Add a new helper function `parent_is_integers` to check if some type/parent represents the integers.

3. Instead of the hacks in `discover_action` and `verify_action` involving an explicit `IntegerMulAction` check, return an `IntegerMulAction` for anything satisfying `parent_is_integers()`.

The `·` is not ascii nor latex: `n · a = a + a + ... + a`. So if you change that to `\cdot` (personally, I would also change the `...` to `\cdots`), then you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Is that a problem really? The documentation builds fine and I think that `·` is more readable than `\cdot` in text mode.

With the non-ascii characters, the pdf docs tend to have difficulty if the encoding is not declared (in particular, the non-ascii hyphen comes to mind). What we probably should do is add a bunch of the unicode versions of certain latex commands to the console doc replacer since we generally assume terminals support unicode.

Thanks for the change.

No, we do the opposite: replace certain Unicode characters by latex when building the PDF docs. In `src/doc/common/conf.py` you will find for example

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{00B7}{\cdot}
```
saying that `·` should be replaced by `\cdot`. So `·` in docstrings should work just fine.
