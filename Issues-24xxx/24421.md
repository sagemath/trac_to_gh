Since we now have proper metric spaces, some cleanup is needed for valuation.

- `DiscreteValuationRings` should be a subcategory of `MetricSpaces`
- remove `CompleteDiscreteValuationRings` and use `DiscreteValuationRings().Complete()`
- remove `CompleteValuationFields` and use `DiscreteValuationRings().Complete().join(Fields())`
