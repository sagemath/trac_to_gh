`is_cut_edge()` says "A cut edge (or bridge) is an edge that when removed increases the number of connected components.", `bridges()` says "A bridge is an edge whose deletion disconnects the graph. A disconnected graph has no bridge."

Which definition we should use?

In any case there are missing crosslinks `is_cut_edge() <-> is_cut_vertex()` etc.

OK. Is there any better way to make change than add a "NOTE: Prior to version 8.x this function..."?

You could simply say that a bridge is a cut edge if and only if the graph is connected ?

In my opinion, the first definition is the more apt. In the second definition, the problem is in the line "A disconnected graph has no bridge". 

This is not true as the individual connected components of a graph are subgraphs in themselves and they also can have bridge edges.
