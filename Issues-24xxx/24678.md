Thanks, and there is no horry at all.

Functions are `evacuation`, `tau` and `promotion`, but propably I can do two if I see how to make one.

It looks like it is sufficient to just overwrite `tau` with something like

```python
    def tau(self, i):
        P = self.poset()
        a = self[i-1]
        b = self[i  ]
        if P.lt(a,b) or P.lt(b,a):
            return self
        q = list(self)
        q[i-1] = b
        q[i  ] = a
        return P.linear_extensions()(q, check=False) # We know this is a linear extension
```
Note that this will never return a greedy linear extension class, but since `evacuation` and `promotion` use `tau`, those will return standard linear extensions by default.

Also `return self` must be corrected. But is this supposed to be in the class `GreedyLinearExtension`? If so, I think for a user it is better to have `_tau()` that is called from `tau()`, so that there is no visible function with the same name.

So, in any case we need classes `LinearExtensionOfPoset` (without `s`) and `LinearExtensionsOfPoset`.

In principle we could have `12/4` be an `Integer`, but that would mean checking the denominator, which has a performance penalty (yes, it is minor, but it matters because of how essential arithmetic operations are). Because of duck-typing, we generally do not care about the distinction between `Rational` and `Integer`. Perhaps a more fair example would be

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: type(1/x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate'>
sage: type(1/(x+1))
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>
```
However, this is not quite our case because we are returning a *subclass*, which is a stronger notion because it will satisfy, e.g., an `isinstance(p, LinearExtensionOfPoset)` check and it has to have the same API as `LinearExtensionOfPoset`.

Note, what I was saying was not to *change* `LinearExtensionOfPoset.tau()`, but to override it with a completely *new* method in the subclass `GreedyLinearExtensionOfPoset`.

But that means that the user sees documentation for both `LinearExtensionOfPoset.tau()` and `GreedyLinearExtensionOfPoset.tau()` even when they have no difference.
