Also `return self` must be corrected. But is this supposed to be in the class `GreedyLinearExtension`? If so, I think for a user it is better to have `_tau()` that is called from `tau()`, so that there is no visible function with the same name.

So, in any case we need classes `LinearExtensionOfPoset` (without `s`) and `LinearExtensionsOfPoset`.

In principle we could have `12/4` be an `Integer`, but that would mean checking the denominator, which has a performance penalty (yes, it is minor, but it matters because of how essential arithmetic operations are). Because of duck-typing, we generally do not care about the distinction between `Rational` and `Integer`. Perhaps a more fair example would be

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: type(1/x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate'>
sage: type(1/(x+1))
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>
```
However, this is not quite our case because we are returning a *subclass*, which is a stronger notion because it will satisfy, e.g., an `isinstance(p, LinearExtensionOfPoset)` check and it has to have the same API as `LinearExtensionOfPoset`.
