I've seen at least a few third-party imports in Sage that contain module-level code that produces `DeprecationWarning`s (mostly from the Python stdlib itself) on Python 3.

For now I've gotten around it by adding a `with warnings.catch_warnings():` and `warnings.filterwarnings()`.  But for at least some of these (such as Sphinx) I believe all the warnings have been fixed upstream.  For the others, they should be fixed as well.

So for Sage's Python 3 port we can probably hold off on doing anything about it until we update those dependencies.  But it's worth making a note of.  Imports that I've seen produce DeprecationWarnings include:

* `twisted.internet.reactor`
* `jinja2`
* `sphinx`

I also see some warnings from `docutils` by way of Sphinx when I try to build the docs.
