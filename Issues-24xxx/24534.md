```
The following test reproduces the problem reliably (for me) in Sage 8.1 (plus one tiny patch needed for psutil to build, which has no runtime effect):

```python
from sage.all import *
import os
import sys

def test():
    return random_matrix(ZZ, 30).determinant(algorithm='linbox',
                                             proof=False)

if os.fork() == 0:
    print('in child; the determinant is: %s' % test())
    sys.stdout.flush()
else:
    print('in parent; the determinant is: %s' % test())
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print('waiting for child')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print(os.wait())
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

This is especially mysterious for a few reasons:

1) I never saw this error before, and I only first starting noticing after I upgraded my Windows machine to the "Windows 10 Fall Creators Update".  That may just be a coincidence though.

2) The issue *does not* occur when I run the [SageMath](SageMath) 8.1 binary for Windows I built a few weeks ago.  I made that build before my Windows update, but running it on the updated Windows has no issue.  The Cygwin version is the same in both cases.

3) All of linbox's `make check` tests pass--I'm not sure if any of them deal with fork, however.

So this is only happening currently in my development Cygwin, and not in a previously built binary.  This suggests to me some kind of problem occurring at build time but it's hard to say yet.
