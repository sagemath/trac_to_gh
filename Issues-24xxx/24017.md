As brought up in #23160, a lot of the `spkg-install` scripts define a helper function like this, so this adds one that they can share.

In many cases this won't even be needed because error messaging is already handled in the `sdh_make` helpers and the like.  But occasionally it's still useful.  This can be used like:

```
command || sdh_die "Error message"
```

much like the `die` command in perl.

Depends on #24092

The `$(_sdh_cols)` thing seems over-engineered to me. In particular, I have doubts about

```
echo "$msg" | fmt -s -w $(_sdh_cols)

because it means that we have to worry about the portability of the `fmt` program. I think it would be much better to just echo the message as-is. Also, there is a typo in a comment: `90` should be `80`.

`fmt` is actually very portable, moreso even than grep.  It's a sadly little-known, but very widely installed program and hasn't changed much over the ages.  See for yourself--it's on OSX, openbsd, freebsd, pretty much any linux, and it's the same everywhere.

I'm not married to having it here, but I think the end result is nicer-looking error messages almost everywhere.

Oh you're right--I thought i did write docs about that but apparently not.

Fair enough. I give you the benefit of the doubt. It still feels over-engineered to me, but I won't block this ticket because of it.

This could be written something like

```

```

though I realize in your example `some_condition` need not be the `test` command either.

Hmm--I think the original logic was that it was a failsafe of sorts; it would not "die" unless the previous command actually exited with an error.  For example, although it's typically used with `||`, if one ran `command; sdh_die ...` it would only "die" if the command returned a non-zero exit status.

But maybe sometimes you'd also want to "die" if some command succeeded.  So I think ultimately this restriction is not well-justified.  I'll remove it.
