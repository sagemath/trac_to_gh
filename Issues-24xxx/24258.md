```
On Python 3 all classes, including built-in types, are represented as `<class '...'>` instead of `<type '...'>` as Python 2 uses for built-in types.

This normalizes the expected doctest output on Python 3 to account for this difference.

Whenever Sage switches to Python 3 as a default it would be simple to also reverse the sense of this normalization, and update the doctests to expect `<class '...'>`.

This replaces #24228, #24229, #24230, and #24233.

Wouldn't it make sense to do that now, i.e. to replace `<type ` by `<class `? That would be more future-proof.

*nod* that was my original plan, but I decided:

a) This would be a less disruptive change for now--just a small change in one module vs. a small change in many

b) For the time being Python 2 is still the default for Sage, so changing all the existing tests (particularly "EXAMPLE" docs) could confuse readers.

If you plan a disruptive change anyway when we switch to Python 3, that argument makes little sense. Why is a disruptive change later better than a disruptive change now.

> b) For the time being Python 2 is still the default for Sage, so changing all the existing tests (particularly "EXAMPLE" docs) could confuse readers.


Fair enough.

A similar, though not exactly the same difference I've noticed is that on Python 3 unbound methods of classes (which are just normal functions) are repr'd with their `__qualname__` which includes the class name.  E.g.

```
>>> class Foo:
...     def a(self): pass
...
>>> Foo.a
<function Foo.a at 0x7fe3d04c9b20>
```

So some tests that happen to rely on such output fail on python 3.

The tests could be rewritten, but it might be nice to automatically account for this difference.  In principle there's a little advantage to having the `__qualname__` in the output since we can also also see in what class the function was defined, but in the meantime we don't lose anything over what we already have by ignoring it.

I could either add that to this ticket, or add a new one.  It might be worth adding to this one since the same issue applies to nested classes.

I implemented a workaround for this, but in implementation it's distinct enough from this issue that I'll just open a separate ticket for this once I'm confident that it's ready.

If I understand things correctly, this ticket ensures that both the following doctests would pass on Python 3:

```
sage: int
<class 'int'>
```
and

```
sage: int
<type 'int'>
```
but on Python 2 only

```
sage: int
<type 'int'>
```
would be accepted. Is that right?

I would very much prefer to accept `<class 'int'>` on Python 2 too. That way, we could at least make *new* doctests more future-proof by using `<class` instead of `<type`.

We can easily make new doctests future-proof by simply using `<... 'int'>`. There is a patchbot plugin that checks for that.

It's because the `<type ...>` repr is split onto multiple lines, which is not supported.  You could either change the regexp to be multi-line (but this introduces more complications), or just fix that test to not split `<type ...>` across lines.
