sage-env now contains two lines like this:

```
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version' 2>/dev/null
```

In a sage install with a moderately slow filesystem and a **LOT** of Python packages installed (e.g., cocalc), this line takes a while (for me, 1.5s).  This means that sage-env takes 3s to load, which is ridiculous, as it should take a few ms.  Running Python fully twice is wasteful.

Let's just not mess with the matplotlib path.    It's very annoying wasting several seconds (for some users) during startup just because we want to hide from better integrating with system python. If the user really has conflicting matplotlib paths, just let them set the variable themselves.
