One could argue that this is simply bad user input, since the problem of factoring a p-adic polynomial is not well-defined if the discriminant is 0.

This is a follow-up to #15422.

in this case, the polynomial is first made integral by dividing out the

we actually factor exactly a polynomial which is only p-adically close
to the input. To avoid pitfalls, we advise to only factor polynomials

I think the solution is to implement the reduction to squarefree factorization in Sage.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I think I remember having this discussion before with you, David.

There is no bug. It's an ill-posed question because there is no uniquely defined answer. To give a simpler example:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ []
sage: ((x+1)^2 - 0*3^12).factor_padic(3)
((1 + O(3^10))*x + (1 + O(3^10)))^2
sage: ((x+1)^2 - 1*3^12).factor_padic(3)
((1 + O(3^10))*x + (1 + 3^6 + O(3^10))) * ((1 + O(3^10))*x + (1 + 2*3^6 + 2*3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)))
sage: ((x+1)^2 - 3*3^12).factor_padic(3)
(1 + O(3^10))*x^2 + (2 + O(3^10))*x + (1 + O(3^10))
```
These are 3 different factorization patterns for polynomials which are all the same up to `O(3^10)`. So if all you have is the 3-adic approximation, there is no way to guess.

Yeah, we've talked about it before though I don't remember the ticket/thread.  I agree that this is not a bug in Pari.  But I think we should adopt a principle in Sage along the lines of "assume you are in the smallest dimensional subvariety that is consistent with the given information."  Otherwise asking for the kernel of a p-adic matrix never makes sense.  Though I guess this is inconsistent with the valuation of `O(p^n)` being `n` and not `infinity`.

Anyway, I'm probably not going to work on this ticket immediately.  When I'm ready to propose concrete changes like this, I'll raise it on the sage-padics list (and try to track down the discussions that we've had previously).

Right. Knowing a p-adic matrix up to any finite absolute precision is never sufficient to know that it has a kernel.

Similarly, knowing any non-squrefree p-adic polynomial to any finite absolute precision is never sufficient to know that it is non-squarefree.

That is mathematics, which is easy :-) The hard question is how to deal with this. Personally, I would argue that it's simply an error to ask something if the answer is not well-defined. That is what I tried in #15422 for factoring, but apparently it didn't quite work.

That being said, I'm not against "fixing" this "bug". It would make sense to do that as part of #12561 (but that seems to be stalled).
