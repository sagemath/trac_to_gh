Could you clarify that?  I don't see how that's useful.  It should be noted that this function passes some arguments to both `TemporaryFile` and `open()`, and the former does *not* accept all the same arguments as the latter (it should, which I think is a defect, but it doesn't).  It also requires special handling depending on whether on Python 2 or 3 anyways.

+1 to adding more tests though.

1. There are several keywords which are accepted by both `open()` and `TemporaryFile()`. If you allow customizing `encoding`, I don't see why you shouldn't allow customize `newline` for example.

2. Python already `encoding=locale.getpreferredencoding()` as default, there is no reason to reimplement handling that as default.

3. I find it conceptually simpler to simply pass `**kwds` unmodified instead of explicitly handling a specific `encoding` keyword.

Can you suggest some need for anything besides universal newline handling in text mode?

> 2. Python already `encoding=locale.getpreferredencoding()` as default, there is no reason to reimplement handling that as default.


*only* in text mode.  If you want to be able to support text and binary modes that needs to be done explicitly.  With normal `io.open` this would be done with a mode string, but that's not really applicable for `atomic_write`.

It really doesn't make sense in this case.  `open` and `TemporaryFile` take different arguments and their use is an implementation detail irrelevant to the API provided by `atomic_write` (which I'm trying to still trying to keep as restricted as possible to meet its narrow use case).

There is no need currently. But I think it is nice design to allow arbitrary arguments. It is narrow-minded to disallow something just because there is currently no use case.

Of course... what's your point? How would you use `encoding` in binary mode? I don't get what you are trying to say...

I don't really agree with that. If you are providing an API dealing with files, it makes sense to have an API which is close to what `open()` provides. And explicitly passing `**kwds` does exactly that. It makes it explicit that you're just providing a wrapper around `open()` and `TemporaryFile()`.

That's not actually what the patch does... I see `tmp_filename()` which is Sage-specific thing.

And it's crucial that the temporary file is created in the same directory as the destination file, otherwise the move is not guaranteed to be atomic. In fact it would be good to add the doctests which shows that the file in indeed created in the right directory.

<a id='comment:18'></a>OK, I am essentially happy with this now. Just a few minor points:

2. add a test for `**kwargs`

2. add a test for *invalid* `**kwargs`
