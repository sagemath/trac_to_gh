If E is an elliptic curve over Q then E.quadratic_twist() returns an elliptic curve which is a quadratic twist of E with minimal conductor.  When there is more than one twist of the same conductor some tie-break is needed.  The documentation says that the curve whose label is first is used if the curve is in the database, otherwise the one whose a-invariants come first lexicographically.  But in the code, the twists are sorted by conductor and the first curve in that sorted list is used.

I implemented the tie-break sorting which was already claimed in the docstring.  To make it easier, and for similar sorting issued with elliptic curve labels, I added a parameter to the functions `parse_cremona_label` and `parse_lmfdb_label` which makes them return a triple of integers, instead of the middle component being a string of letters representing an integer in base 26.

Only one doctest output had to be changed.  With `j=8000`, it now returns '256a1' instead of '256d1'.
