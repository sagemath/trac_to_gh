sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import *
sage: print(sage_getdoc_original(sage.categories.category_types.AbelianCategory))

        Initializes this category.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: class SemiprimitiveRings(Category):
...
```
This is the doc for `Category.__init__` and it seems incorrect to use this as doc for `AbelianCategory`.

Maybe, but inheriting docstrings is not what Python does, so that should be considered a bug unless explicitly asked for.
