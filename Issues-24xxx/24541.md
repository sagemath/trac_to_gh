For cones not living in toric lattices `orthogonal_sublattice` may be completely wrong, e.g.

```
sage: c = Cone([(1,0)], lattice=ZZ^2)
sage: c.orthogonal_sublattice()
Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
sage: c.dual()
...
TypeError: cannot convert (1) to Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field!
```
The bug was introduced a long time ago by #13183.

Component: **geometry**
