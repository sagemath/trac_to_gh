Adds a context manager that can save and restore the state of the `atexit` module.

This functionality is currently only needed by the test runner (see `DocTestTask`) but is non-trivial on Python 3 since the list of registered atexit handler functions is no longer exposed to Python.

If you say so--I felt like it would be good to add a module to `sage.misc` specifically for context managers *in general*.  I'm not sure how I feel about `sage.cpython` for this.

I'd say normally this goes against how the module is intended to be used, but if nothing else, as this case demonstrates, it may be useful for testing purposes to be able to do this through underscored methods as was the case in Python 2.  I'll bring it up...

> I don't think you need to add additional functionality to `setup.py`. Compiling extensions only on Python 3 an be done by using an `OptionalExtension(..., condition=six.PY3)` in `module_list.py`. This also gives the advantage that modules are at least cythonized on Python 2, so certain kinds of breakage will be detected even on Python 2.

Ah, I didn't know about `OptionalExtension`.  The thing is that since this was originally in `sage.misc`, you have in there `Extension('sage/misc/*.pyx')` so I'm not sure how `OptionalExtension` would play with that (or something equivalent that might come up even if I moved it).

Cython is clever enough to deal with that. Extensions which are explicitly listed take precedence over extensions specified by a glob pattern. See for example

```python
    # Compile this with -Os because it works around a bug with
    # GCC-4.7.3 + Cython 0.19 on Itanium, see Trac #14452. Moreover, it
    # actually results in faster code than -O3.
    Extension('sage.structure.element',
              sources = ['sage/structure/element.pyx'],
              extra_compile_args=["-Os"]),

    Extension('*', ['sage/structure/*.pyx']),
```

Overall, this looks good. There are various details to be fixed though:

1. The title still says "A home for miscellaneous context managers."

2. You import `six` but don't use it.

3. The doc of `restore_atexit` is misformatted. The correct format is

```
    EXAMPLES:

    For this example...

    ...of the ``atexit`` state::

        sage: import atexit
```

4. I would move the comment "# These are helper functions..." outside of the `IF` block. There is also a typo: implements -> implementations.

5. I find it mildly ugly that the signature of the helper functions is different in the Python 2 and Python 3 versions (`cdef inline list` vs. `def`) Since performance doesn't really matter here, I would make all functions simply Python (`def`) functions. Then they can be imported as usual.

6. I think the doctest would be more clear by adding some `print` statements showing the list of registered handlers in appropriate places. Something like

```
sage: print("Initial exitfuncs: {}".format(_get_exithandlers()))
```

7. Add a comment above `ctypedef struct atexit_callback:` that you are copying the internal structures of the `atexit` module, see `Modules/atexitmodule.c` in the Python sources.

8. The Python 3 version of `_set_exithandlers` says "Replace the list of exit handlers..." but doesn't it instead *append* to the existing list?

9. Add a test with an empty `restore_atexit():` context:

```
with restore_atexit():
    pass
```
showing that the list of registered functions is the same before and after. That would have caught 8.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A22):
> 8. The Python 3 version of `_set_exithandlers` says "Replace the list of exit handlers..." but doesn't it instead *append* to the existing list?

That's a good point--it should clear the existing list first.

Two more things before a positive review:

1. `def _set_exithandlers(list exithandlers)`: remove `list` typing. We might as well allow arbitrary iterables.

2. Add this new module to the documentation in `src/doc/en/reference/cpython/index.rst`
