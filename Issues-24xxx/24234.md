Adds a context manager that can save and restore the state of the `atexit` module.

This functionality is currently only needed by the test runner (see `DocTestTask`) but is non-trivial on Python 3 since the list of registered atexit handler functions is no longer exposed to Python.

Writing a function to return a list would be easy.  The problem is that mutating that list would either have no effect, or would have to be propagated back to the internal array of callbacks.

I'd say normally this goes against how the module is intended to be used, but if nothing else, as this case demonstrates, it may be useful for testing purposes to be able to do this through underscored methods as was the case in Python 2.  I'll bring it up...

Cython is clever enough to deal with that. Extensions which are explicitly listed take precedence over extensions specified by a glob pattern. See for example

```python
    # Compile this with -Os because it works around a bug with
    # GCC-4.7.3 + Cython 0.19 on Itanium, see Trac #14452. Moreover, it
    # actually results in faster code than -O3.
    Extension('sage.structure.element',
              sources = ['sage/structure/element.pyx'],
              extra_compile_args=["-Os"]),

    Extension('*', ['sage/structure/*.pyx']),
```
