Adds a context manager that can save and restore the state of the `atexit` module.

This functionality is currently only needed by the test runner (see `DocTestTask`) but is non-trivial on Python 3 since the list of registered atexit handler functions is no longer exposed to Python.

If you say so--I felt like it would be good to add a module to `sage.misc` specifically for context managers *in general*.  I'm not sure how I feel about `sage.cpython` for this.

Writing a function to return a list would be easy.  The problem is that mutating that list would either have no effect, or would have to be propagated back to the internal array of callbacks.

I'd say normally this goes against how the module is intended to be used, but if nothing else, as this case demonstrates, it may be useful for testing purposes to be able to do this through underscored methods as was the case in Python 2.  I'll bring it up...

It makes a lot more sense to group functionality according to topic (the `cpython` directory for dealing with Python internals) rather than implementation type (context managers).

Cython is clever enough to deal with that. Extensions which are explicitly listed take precedence over extensions specified by a glob pattern. See for example

```python
    # Compile this with -Os because it works around a bug with
    # GCC-4.7.3 + Cython 0.19 on Itanium, see Trac #14452. Moreover, it
    # actually results in faster code than -O3.
    Extension('sage.structure.element',
              sources = ['sage/structure/element.pyx'],
              extra_compile_args=["-Os"]),

    Extension('*', ['sage/structure/*.pyx']),
```

Overall, this looks good. There are various details to be fixed though:

1. The title still says "A home for miscellaneous context managers."

2. You import `six` but don't use it.

3. The doc of `restore_atexit` is misformatted. The correct format is

```
    EXAMPLES:

    For this example...

    ...of the ``atexit`` state::

        sage: import atexit
```

4. I would move the comment "# These are helper functions..." outside of the `IF` block. There is also a typo: implements -> implementations.

5. I find it mildly ugly that the signature of the helper functions is different in the Python 2 and Python 3 versions (`cdef inline list` vs. `def`) Since performance doesn't really matter here, I would make all functions simply Python (`def`) functions. Then they can be imported as usual.

6. I think the doctest would be more clear by adding some `print` statements showing the list of registered handlers in appropriate places. Something like

```
sage: print("Initial exitfuncs: {}".format(_get_exithandlers()))
```

7. Add a comment above `ctypedef struct atexit_callback:` that you are copying the internal structures of the `atexit` module, see `Modules/atexitmodule.c` in the Python sources.

8. The Python 3 version of `_set_exithandlers` says "Replace the list of exit handlers..." but doesn't it instead *append* to the existing list?

9. Add a test with an empty `restore_atexit():` context:

```
with restore_atexit():
    pass
```
showing that the list of registered functions is the same before and after. That would have caught 8.

Two more things before a positive review:

1. `def _set_exithandlers(list exithandlers)`: remove `list` typing. We might as well allow arbitrary iterables.

2. Add this new module to the documentation in `src/doc/en/reference/cpython/index.rst`
