```
Adds a context manager that can save and restore the state of the `atexit` module.

This functionality is currently only needed by the test runner (see `DocTestTask`) but is non-trivial on Python 3 since the list of registered atexit handler functions is no longer exposed to Python.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:10):
> I don't think you need to add additional functionality to `setup.py`. Compiling extensions only on Python 3 an be done by using an `OptionalExtension(..., condition=six.PY3)` in `module_list.py`. This also gives the advantage that modules are at least cythonized on Python 2, so certain kinds of breakage will be detected even on Python 2.

Ah, I didn't know about `OptionalExtension`.  The thing is that since this was originally in `sage.misc`, you have in there `Extension('sage/misc/*.pyx')` so I'm not sure how `OptionalExtension` would play with that (or something equivalent that might come up even if I moved it).

Cython is clever enough to deal with that. Extensions which are explicitly listed take precedence over extensions specified by a glob pattern. See for example

```python
    # Compile this with -Os because it works around a bug with
    # GCC-4.7.3 + Cython 0.19 on Itanium, see Trac #14452. Moreover, it
    # actually results in faster code than -O3.
    Extension('sage.structure.element',
              sources = ['sage/structure/element.pyx'],
              extra_compile_args=["-Os"]),

    Extension('*', ['sage/structure/*.pyx']),
```

Overall, this looks good. There are various details to be fixed though:

1. The title still says "A home for miscellaneous context managers."

2. You import `six` but don't use it.

3. The doc of `restore_atexit` is misformatted. The correct format is

```
    EXAMPLES:

    For this example...

    ...of the ``atexit`` state::

        sage: import atexit
```

4. I would move the comment "# These are helper functions..." outside of the `IF` block. There is also a typo: implements -> implementations.

5. I find it mildly ugly that the signature of the helper functions is different in the Python 2 and Python 3 versions (`cdef inline list` vs. `def`) Since performance doesn't really matter here, I would make all functions simply Python (`def`) functions. Then they can be imported as usual.

6. I think the doctest would be more clear by adding some `print` statements showing the list of registered handlers in appropriate places. Something like

```
sage: print("Initial exitfuncs: {}".format(_get_exithandlers()))
```

7. Add a comment above `ctypedef struct atexit_callback:` that you are copying the internal structures of the `atexit` module, see `Modules/atexitmodule.c` in the Python sources.

8. The Python 3 version of `_set_exithandlers` says "Replace the list of exit handlers..." but doesn't it instead *append* to the existing list?

9. Add a test with an empty `restore_atexit():` context:

```
with restore_atexit():
    pass
```
showing that the list of registered functions is the same before and after. That would have caught 8.
