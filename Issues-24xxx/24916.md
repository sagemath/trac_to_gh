This code in `coerce.pyx` has always been wrong:

```
         if y_is_Element:
             if (<Element>y)._parent.get_flag(Parent_richcmp_element_without_coercion):
                return Py_TYPE(y).tp_richcompare(x, y, op)
```
because the `self` argument of `__richcmp__` should be of the correct type. So the last line should be replaced by

```
                return Py_TYPE(y).tp_richcompare(y, x, revop(op))
```
but this caused some breakage in `linear_functions.pyx` that needed to be fixed.
