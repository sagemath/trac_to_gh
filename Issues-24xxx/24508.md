Lots and lots of tests fail on Python 3 due to the use of `random_element`s in tests.

The problem, I've found, is not to do with seeding the RNG.  Python's `random` produces the same sequence with the same seed on Python 2 and 3.  However, there is a slight difference in the implementation of `random.randint`, such that it does produce different values, annoyingly.

I'm not sure how we want to deal with this.  In Sage there's a `sage.misc.prandom` that for some reason provides wrappers around functions from Python's `random` module.  Perhaps one thing we could do is ensure that `sage.misc.prandom` is always used, and modify its wrapper to `randint` (actually `randrange`, which `randint` is implemented on top of), to provide consistent results.

I considered that--it seemed unlikely considering that through Python 2.7.14 this has never been an issue, and most non-essential fixes are not being backported to Python 2.

Then again, Python 2 will still be receiving security-related fixes for a while, and the `random` module is definitely a potential target for security fixes, so indeed it might be worth pinning even for Python 2.

> 2. You can optimize `if self._python_random is not None and type(self._python_random) is cls:` to `type(self._python_random) is cls:`


A minor point but true.
