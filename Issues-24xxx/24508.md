Lots and lots of tests fail on Python 3 due to the use of `random_element`s in tests.

The problem, I've found, is not to do with seeding the RNG.  Python's `random` produces the same sequence with the same seed on Python 2 and 3.  However, there is a slight difference in the implementation of `random.randint`, such that it does produce different values, annoyingly.

I'm not sure how we want to deal with this.  In Sage there's a `sage.misc.prandom` that for some reason provides wrappers around functions from Python's `random` module.  Perhaps one thing we could do is ensure that `sage.misc.prandom` is always used, and modify its wrapper to `randint` (actually `randrange`, which `randint` is implemented on top of), to provide consistent results.

Here's a possible workaround for this issue.  This is far from ideal in that it wholesale copy/pastes the Python 2 implementation of `random.Random`.  Hypothetically we could get away with copying only smaller sections, but this seemed like the most practical and sure to be consistent solution.

This is also not great since we should be testing against the real `random.Random` implementation being used at runtime.  I think that for the sake of initial porting of Python 3 this is acceptable, however, and the likelihood of bugs specific to the `Random` implementation are low.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):
> 1. Shouldn't you use `_py2_random.py` also on Python 2? Then you are sure that doctests will remain consistent, independently of any future changes to the upstream `random` module.

I considered that--it seemed unlikely considering that through Python 2.7.14 this has never been an issue, and most non-essential fixes are not being backported to Python 2.

Then again, Python 2 will still be receiving security-related fixes for a while, and the `random` module is definitely a potential target for security fixes, so indeed it might be worth pinning even for Python 2.

> 2. You can optimize `if self._python_random is not None and type(self._python_random) is cls:` to `type(self._python_random) is cls:`

A minor point but true.
