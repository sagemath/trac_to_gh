This is a meta-ticket for tickets that address updating other packages to use the helper functions in `sage-dist-helpers` where possible.  There are
a few advantages to doing this:

* In general it simplifies these scripts and reduces a lot of boilerplate.  As more functions get written even more boilerplate can be removed, but even the existing functions help a lot.
* Although this requires irritating bulk updates to packages now, it reduces the overall need for such bulk updates in the future, since many packages that have similar build and installation steps can be be updated at once by updates to the applicable helper functions.

The second bullet point is especially motivated right now by #22509.  Since it requires updates to nearly every package in Sage anyways, it makes more sense to update most packages to use the helper functions, and then add `DESTDIR` support through the helper functions.  In particular, the vast majority of Python and autotools packages can be given `DESTDIR` support en masse by this approach.

* #24014 and #24018 -- Update Python packages that are installed with `pip` to use `sdh_pip_install`
* #24025 -- Update "trivial" autotools packages to use `sdh_configure`, `sdh_make`, and `sdh_install`.  By "trivial" I mean packages with very simple build scripts that can be mechanically updated with simple replacements.
