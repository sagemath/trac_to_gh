1. Several patches have been added *without* changing `package-version.txt`. This is obviously asking for trouble since the patches will simply not be applied. In particular, #21759 is required for GCC-7.2.0.

2. It gives doctest failures on ppc64le due to an assumption that `char` == `signed char`. Upstream: https://github.com/tscrim/coxeter/pull/13

3. Several files in `build/pkgs/coxeter3/patches` are simply copied instead of being patches.

4. The package does not respect `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS`, which makes issues harder to debug.

The attached branch fixes issue 1, 2 and 3. Issue 4 should be fixed upstream first (https://github.com/tscrim/coxeter/issues/2)

I diagnosed issue 2: it's because something is assuming that `char` == `signed char` and this is not the case on ppc64le (and on ARM neither): `char` is unsigned.

Compiling coxeter3 with `-fsigned-char` fixes the problem. Ideally, the source code should be fixed by replacing `char -> signed char` where needed but in the worst case, we can just compile with `-fsigned-char`.
