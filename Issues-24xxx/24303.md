sage: G.legend(True)
sage: G.show()
...
.../graphics.pyc in
   2661             leg = subplot.legend(prop=prop, **lopts)
   2662             if leg is None:
-> 2663                 sage.misc.misc.warn("legend requested but no items are labeled")
   2664             else:
   2665                 # color
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'warn'
```

This is the kind of things that should have been in a doctest!!
