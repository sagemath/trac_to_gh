I tried calculating 

```

a=e^(I*pi/4)+1
b=1-e^(I*pi/4)
a*b

```

and both expressions a*b and a/b don't stop computing. 

I tried both on sage-8.1 for Windows and on sage-8.2.beta6 on Ubuntu (native Ubuntu desktop on Windows10).

<a id='comment:4'></a>I can confirm it on archlinux with compiled sage-8.2.beta6, sage-8.2.beta5 and sage-8.1.
However, with the sagemath 8.1-11 from the archlinux community repository it does work.


```
sage: a = 1 + e^(I*pi/4)
sage: b = 1 - e^(I*pi/4)
sage: a*b
1/4*((I + 1)*sqrt(2) - 2)*(-(I + 1)*sqrt(2) - 2)
sage: a/b
-1/2*(-(I + 1)*sqrt(2) - 2)/(-(1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2) + 1)
