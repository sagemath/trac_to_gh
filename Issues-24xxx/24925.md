As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41419/flow-gives-error-for-disconnected-vertices/), the `_ford_fulkerson` method for graphs does not handle unconnected vertices correctly:

```
sage: G = Graph({0:[],1:[]})
sage: G.flow(0,1, algorithm='FF')
ValueError: vertex '0' is not in the (di)graph
```

To be compared to:

```
sage: G.flow(0,1, algorithm='LP')
0.0
sage: G.flow(0,1, algorithm='igraph') # depends on python_igraph
0.0
```

Moreover, the error message is misleading since the vertex is here:

```
sage: G.vertices()
[0, 1]
```

This is because the test is about some `residual` auxiliary graph, not `self`.

Also, this method lacks test, there are much less than the various proposed options.


Keywords: graph, digraph, linear optimization
