Also add definition of interval graph and a link to Wikipedia page.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Some comments

You should
- move `See :wikipedia:`Interval_graph` for more information.` to the SEEALSO block. 
- add link to `is_chordal`, `IntervalGraph`, `RandomIntervalGraph` in see also block

- `The Petersen Graph is not chordal, so in can't` -> `The Petersen Graph is not chordal, so it can't`

- `Enumerate all small interval graphs::` -> `Enumerate all small interval graphs (see :oeis:`A005975`)::`
- then remove `Compare to A005975 in OEIS.`

- I'm not sure of the interest of the line `sage: print(d)`

you may remove some `[ ]` in the code, for instance: 
* `set([])` -> `set()`
* `dict([(v, (beg[v], end[v])) for v in self])` -> `{v: (beg[v], end[v]) for v in self}`

Of 21 Wikipedia links on the doc page only one, `is_self_complementary`, has the link in SEEALSO block. So I think this should discussed on sage-devel and to be done in all functions.

I will do other changes.
