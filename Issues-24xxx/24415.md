This makes a few minor fixes to this module for better Python 3 support, but also one change that is potentially impactful.

The problem with this module on Python 3 is the use of a single reusable `AttributeError` instance for each call of `getattr_from_other_class`.  This was causing quite a bit of havok on Python 3, where exception objects have much more information attached to them--most significantly the traceback object itself (on its `__traceback__` attribute), as well as the `__context__` attribute for exceptions that were raised while handling a different exception (which in turn still has its own traceback attached to it).

Since this global `AttributeError` instance is never deallocated, then following a call to `getattr_from_other_class` if it raises an `AttributeError`, that error's traceback and associated stack frames and their local variables persist until the next `AttributeError`, resulting in various reference leaks, cycles, and also some truly baffling tracebacks.

This ticket undoes that optimization (originally from #14100).  My own findings were that on Python 2 it at best had a saving of ~0.5Âµs, and practically no noticeable improvement on Python 3.  I'm not convinced this is a major bottleneck, as efficient loops should not be raising exceptions in the first place, much less `AttributeError`s. I kept the single reusable `AttributeErrorMessage` instance since it's harmless.

That said, I might be missing some context to this and would be open to other solutions.  I do have one other solution that would be just as good in terms of performance, but would unfortunately be much more complicated code-wise so I'd have to be sure it's really worth the trouble...
