```
sage: L.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 'q') is L
False
```
to be compared with

```
sage: R.<q> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'q') is R
True
```

We also fix

```
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(Zmod(4), 'x').category()
Category of fields
```

We also remove the classes `LaurentSeriesRing_generic`, `LaurentSeriesRing_domain`, `LaurentSeriesRing_field` in favor of a unique `LaurentSeriesRing`.

Since you are going to do the category imports in the `__init__` (which I'm not 100% in agreement with), I would make it in as small as scope as possible:

```diff
         from sage.categories.rings import Rings
         from sage.categories.integral_domains import IntegralDomains
         from sage.categories.fields import Fields
-        from sage.categories.complete_discrete_valuation import (
-                CompleteDiscreteValuationRings, CompleteDiscreteValuationFields)
 
         base_ring = power_series.base_ring()
         if base_ring in Fields():
+            from sage.categories.complete_discrete_valuation import CompleteDiscreteValuationFields
             category = CompleteDiscreteValuationFields()
         elif base_ring in IntegralDomains():
             category = IntegralDomains()
         elif base_ring in Rings().Commutative():
             category = Rings().Commutative()
         else:
             raise ValueError('unrecognized base ring')
```
Also, don't we want to use `names=power_series.variable_names()` in case we (eventually support) have multiple variable names. Otherwise LGTM.

Why? I am happy to move them at the module scope if it is a better practice.
