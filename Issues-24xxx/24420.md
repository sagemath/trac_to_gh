```
sage: L.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 'q') is L
False
```
to be compared with

```
sage: R.<q> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'q') is R
True
```

We also fix

```
sage: LaurentSeriesRing(Zmod(4), 'x').category()
Category of fields
```

We also remove the classes `LaurentSeriesRing_generic`, `LaurentSeriesRing_domain`, `LaurentSeriesRing_field` in favor of a unique `LaurentSeriesRing`.
