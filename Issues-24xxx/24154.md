As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/TuF0CidR-JI/8-zpcu-MCgAJ, the preprocessing code in `integral_points_count` sometimes fails. This is ultimately because `Polyhedron.to_linear_program` does not handle equations correctly.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[19]])
sage: P.to_linear_program().show()
Maximization:
  

Constraints:
  constraint_0: -19 <= x_0 <= -19
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=-oo, max=+oo)
sage: P.to_linear_program().polyhedron().vertices_list()
