We do not need to create another copy of the augmented matrix to keep memory usage down (including putting it in a cache) and because it is faster.

We do this change in `__invert__`, `right_kernel_matrix`, and `_solve_right_nonsingular_square`.

We also can take advantage of the sparse structure and our knowledge of the augmented matrix [I|A<sup>-1</sup>] when reconstructing the matrix.

This is a bit weird

```
+        for i in range(nrows):
+            del data[i,i]
+        data = {(r,c-nrows): data[r,c] for (r,c) in data}
```
You are modifying `data` and then override it. If you can not do the modification inplace, the following looks simpler

```
data = {(r,c-nrows): data[r,c] for (r,c) in data if c >= nrows}

Oh, I see.

Note that for matrices over ZZ or QQ, there is a custom C datatype which is an array of sparse vectors. This is not ideal but already faster than dictionaries in most contexts.
