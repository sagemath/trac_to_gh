We do not need to create another copy of the augmented matrix to keep memory usage down (including putting it in a cache) and because it is faster.

We do this change in `__invert__`, `right_kernel_matrix`, and `_solve_right_nonsingular_square`.

We also can take advantage of the sparse structure and our knowledge of the augmented matrix [I|A<sup>-1</sup>] when reconstructing the matrix.

This is a bit weird

```

You are modifying `data` and then override it. If you can not do the modification inplace, the following looks simpler

Oh, I see.

Note that for matrices over ZZ or QQ, there is a custom C datatype which is an array of sparse vectors. This is not ideal but already faster than dictionaries in most contexts.
