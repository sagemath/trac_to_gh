We do not need to create another copy of the augmented matrix to keep memory usage down (including putting it in a cache) and because it is faster.

We do this change in `__invert__`, `right_kernel_matrix`, and `_solve_right_nonsingular_square`.

We also can take advantage of the sparse structure and our knowledge of the augmented matrix [I|A<sup>-1</sup>] when reconstructing the matrix.
