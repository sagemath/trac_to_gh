```
By results of Nikulin:
The genus of an even integral quadratic form is determined by
`(s_+,s_-,q)`
where `s_+,s_-` is the signature and `q` a torsion quadratic form with values in `QQ/2ZZ`

The genus of an odd integral quadratic form is determined by
`(s_+,s_-,b)`
here `b` is a torsion bilinear form with values in `QQ/ZZ`

We have `TorsionQuadraticModule` and we have
`sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.Genus`

This ticket should implement the Theorem of Nikulin.

<a id='comment:38'></a>I think you should add that as a test, although maybe shortening down the values of `det`?

Also, some nitpicks while-you-are-at-it:

- The alignment of the `import` should be at the opening parenthesis level (otherwise it looks strange, and I think this is a PEP8 thing too).
- The closing `]` in `block1` and `block2` IMO looks better at the same level as the `[`.
- The `else` after the `for` loops at the end of `genus` is unnecessary and makes it seem like the code could return a `None` (whereas you really want it to error out if that `if` statement is never satisfied).

<a id='comment:41'></a>You're welcome, it was no problem.

You will need to do the following changes:

```diff
-            sage: genera = flatten([genera(s, d, even=False) for d in dets for s in signatures])    # long
-            sage: all(g == g.discriminant_form().genus(g.signature_pair()) for g in genera)
+            sage: genera = flatten([genera(s, d, even=False) for d in dets for s in signatures])  # long time
+            sage: all(g == g.discriminant_form().genus(g.signature_pair()) for g in genera)  # long time
             True
-            """
+        """
```
Without marking the second test as `# long time`, you will get an error when running only the short doctests as `genera` is undefined. Also, you will want to mark that as `TESTS:`, maybe also

```diff
-        A systematic test of lattices of
-        small ranks and determinants::
+        A systematic test of lattices of small ranks and determinants::
```
