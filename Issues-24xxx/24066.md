This is an issue which comes up not very often but sufficiently enough that we should support it: the basic idea is that some `Element` class does not want the default coercion model implementation of arithmetic/comparisons. Imagine such a class:

```
class Special(Element):
    def __add__(left, right):
        ...
```

Now when doing something like `1.0 + Special()`, Python will call `Element.__add__(1.0, Special())`, which in turn will invoke the coercion model. So there is no way for the class `Special` to say that it doesn't want to use the coercion model.
