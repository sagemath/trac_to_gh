This is definitely the right direction.  I'm not 100% sure how I feel about `string_to_str`.  Usually it's not desirable on Python 2, if you already have a `unicode` object, to convert it to `str`.  This function has very orthogonal behavior between Python 2 and Python 3 because on Python 2 it takes a unicode string and returns a bytes string, whereas on Python 3 it takes a unicode string and returns the same unicode string--very confusing and not clear where that behavior is useful.

Rather than "string_to_..." I think it's more useful to have a set of four functions:

`bytes_to_str`, `str_to_bytes`, `unicode_to_str`, `str_to_unicode`.

On Python 2 `bytes_to_str` and `str_to_bytes` are no-ops because `bytes is str`.  Keeping cases that were already `str` on Python 2 is usually preferable than converting to `unicode` everywhere.  This is more backwards compatible.  You don't want to start converting `str` to `unicode` everywhere that wasn't `unicode` before if you don't have to.

Similarly on Python 3 `unicode_to_str` and `str_to_unicode` are no-ops.  This pair is also not usually as useful but it can be sometimes I suppose.

...if it's a `cdef inline` function.

Something like

```
cdef extern from *:
    int PY_MAJOR_VERSION

cdef inline bytes_to_str(x):
    if PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:
        return <str>x
    return x.decode(encoding)
```

Ideally, that would be optimized away entirely in Python 2. This is not entirely true, because Cython still changes some refcounts. But the effect of that should be negligible.

Erik's implementation of `bytes_to_str` and `str_to_bytes` is at #24222 and needs review.

I mean in fairness this came before #24222, which was my offer of an alternative.  I think we can do without this for now.  One thing I do like about it is that it supports conversion of `unicode` objects on Python 2 to "bytes".  #24222 eschews any attempt at general unicode support on Python 2, but it might be worth adding support for passing `unicode` through my `str_to_bytes()` function at some point.

Other than that though I don't think this ticket itself is needed.
