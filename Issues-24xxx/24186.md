This function has very orthogonal behavior between Python 2 and Python 3 because on Python 2 it takes a unicode string and returns a bytes string, whereas on Python 3 it takes a unicode string and returns the same unicode string--very confusing and not clear where that behavior is useful.

Rather than "string_to_..." I think it's more useful to have a set of four functions:

`bytes_to_str`, `str_to_bytes`, `unicode_to_str`, `str_to_unicode`.

On Python 2 `bytes_to_str` and `str_to_bytes` are no-ops because `bytes is str`.  Keeping cases that were already `str` on Python 2 is usually preferable than converting to `unicode` everywhere.  This is more backwards compatible.  You don't want to start converting `str` to `unicode` everywhere that wasn't `unicode` before if you don't have to.

Similarly on Python 3 `unicode_to_str` and `str_to_unicode` are no-ops.  This pair is also not usually as useful but it can be sometimes I suppose.

...if it's a `cdef inline` function.

Something like

```
cdef extern from *:
    int PY_MAJOR_VERSION

cdef inline bytes_to_str(x):
    if PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:
        return <str>x
    return x.decode(encoding)
```

Ideally, that would be optimized away entirely in Python 2. This is not entirely true, because Cython still changes some refcounts. But the effect of that should be negligible.

This is because in many cases `bytes` in Cython code comes from `char*` in C and the direct conversion `char*` -> `str` will be faster than `char*` -> `bytes` -> `str`. And `char*` -> `str` is easy using `PyString_FromString` (Python 2) or  `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault` (Python 3).",

Erik, will you do that or should I?

One suggestion: I suggest to implement conversion `char*` -> `str` and then do conversion `bytes` -> `str` using that. This is because in many cases `bytes` in Cython code comes from `char*` in C and the direct conversion `char*` -> `str` will be faster than `char*` -> `bytes` -> `str`. And `char*` -> `str` is easy using `PyString_FromString` (Python 2) or  `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault` (Python 3).

I was thinking something like

```
cdef str array_to_str(char* x):
    ...

cpdef str bytes_to_str(b):
    return array_to_str(PyBytes_AsString(b))
