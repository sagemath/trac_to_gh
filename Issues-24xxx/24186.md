<a id='comment:2'></a>This is definitely the right direction.  I'm not 100% sure how I feel about `string_to_str`.  Usually it's not desirable on Python 2, if you already have a `unicode` object, to convert it to `str`.  This function has very orthogonal behavior between Python 2 and Python 3 because on Python 2 it takes a unicode string and returns a bytes string, whereas on Python 3 it takes a unicode string and returns the same unicode string--very confusing and not clear where that behavior is useful.

Rather than "string_to_..." I think it's more useful to have a set of four functions:

`bytes_to_str`, `str_to_bytes`, `unicode_to_str`, `str_to_unicode`.

On Python 2 `bytes_to_str` and `str_to_bytes` are no-ops because `bytes is str`.  Keeping cases that were already `str` on Python 2 is usually preferable than converting to `unicode` everywhere.  This is more backwards compatible.  You don't want to start converting `str` to `unicode` everywhere that wasn't `unicode` before if you don't have to.

Similarly on Python 3 `unicode_to_str` and `str_to_unicode` are no-ops.  This pair is also not usually as useful but it can be sometimes I suppose.

...if it's a `cdef inline` function.

Something like

```
cdef extern from *:
    int PY_MAJOR_VERSION

cdef inline bytes_to_str(x):
    if PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:
        return <str>x
    return x.decode(encoding)
```

Ideally, that would be optimized away entirely in Python 2. This is not entirely true, because Cython still changes some refcounts. But the effect of that should be negligible.
