Instead of requiring that the input of `str_to_bytes()` is always `str`, it should accept both `bytes` and `unicode` (*). So, instead of a condition depending on the Python version, we should have a condition depending on the input type.

(*) in the Cython sense, so this means `str` on Python 3.

You are right as usual :-) Actually, the default is ASCII on Python 2.

But you have to admit that it is confusing: there is a notion of a "default encoding" (ASCII on py2 and UTF-8 on py3) which is different from the "preferred encoding" determined by the locale.

After all the effort you put into convincing me that `locale.getpreferredencoding()` is the right default, why change it to UTF-8?

Personally, I still think that the best solution is still "Explicit is better than implicit", so always require choosing an encoding. As second best option, I would use `locale.getpreferredencoding()` as default since that is what Python mostly uses as default (`open()` is an important example)

<a id='comment:10'></a>On the encoding: I thought I explained my change of thinking above, but there are a few reasons (and I'm torn either way):

That is, if you want Python to use anything other than the "C" locale (or at least any non-ASCII encoding from the locale) you have to at least manually call `setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")` at least once.  Python 3, however, does exactly this during interpreter startup, which makes a major difference.

3) While it's true that Python uses `locale.getpreferredencoding()` in lots of places as the default encoding (most notably `open()`) I've found so far with these utility functions that they don't have a lot of impact w.r.t. file I/O.

4) It might actually be saner and more predictable to defaulting to UTF-8, especially when a user explicitly passes some non-ASCII unicode text to a function that is supposed to support unicode, if the user's locale is non-unicode they may get encoding errors.  

Relatedly, having a default does not necessarily violate "explicit is better than implicit" as long as that default is predictable and well-documented.  With the locale-based encoding it isn't that, even though I personally would prefer it in most cases.

And yes, I realize I've previously argued for the opposite--I think with good reasons--but now I've convinced myself the other way around.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  `str_to_bytes` really shouldn't accept `bytes` on Python 3.

The error message would be wrong on Python 3 since there is no "unicode" (and this error message is intended for users who would normally be writing plain Python, not Cython).  That's why I have slightly different duplicates of this code.

`PyUnicode_AsUTF8` doesn't exist on Python 2 so I'm not sure why you removed this check.  I'm not sure if that actually matters from Cython's end though.

Looks good to me otherwise in principle; I just want to test it on my Python 3 branch.
