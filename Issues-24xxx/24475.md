Instead of requiring that the input of `str_to_bytes()` is always `str`, it should accept both `bytes` and `unicode` (*). So, instead of a condition depending on the Python version, we should have a condition depending on the input type.

(*) in the Cython sense, so this means `str` on Python 3.

That's not true.  The latter uses UTF-8 as the default encoding.

You are right as usual :-) Actually, the default is ASCII on Python 2.

But you have to admit that it is confusing: there is a notion of a "default encoding" (ASCII on py2 and UTF-8 on py3) which is different from the "preferred encoding" determined by the locale.

After all the effort you put into convincing me that `locale.getpreferredencoding()` is the right default, why change it to UTF-8?

Personally, I still think that the best solution is still "Explicit is better than implicit", so always require choosing an encoding. As second best option, I would use `locale.getpreferredencoding()` as default since that is what Python mostly uses as default (`open()` is an important example)

Instead, one has to `import locale` (which has to be done in the function, otherwise it won't work when Cython inlines it), and call `locale.getpreferredencoding()`.  This in turn calls `setlocale` which isn't thread-safe (though maybe that doesn't matter for Sage's purposes, but I worried it would limit where this could be used).\n\n2) You can avoid the `setlocale` call by calling `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`. However, this has unfortunate ramifications on Python 2.  All programs start out in the \"C\" locale (i.e. ASCII) by default.  In Python 2 the interpreter only temporarily enables the user's locale in order to determine what to use for \"filesystem encoding\", but then switches back to the default.  That is, if you want Python to use anything other than the \"C\" locale (or at least any non-ASCII encoding from the locale) you have to at least manually call `setlocale(LC_CTYPE, \"\")` at least once.  Python 3, however, does exactly this during interpreter startup, which makes a major difference.\n\n3) While it's true that Python uses `locale.getpreferredencoding()` in lots of places as the default encoding (most notably `open()`) I've found so far with these utility functions that they don't have a lot of impact w.r.t. file I/O.  In the past, the most challenging Python 3 ports I've worked on have had a lot to do with file I/O which is why this was heavily on my mind, but so far in porting Sage this has been less of any issue. \n\n4) It might actually be saner and more predictable to defaulting to UTF-8, especially when a user explicitly passes some non-ASCII unicode text to a function that is supposed to support unicode, if the user's locale is non-unicode they may get encoding errors.  \n\nRelatedly, having a default does not necessarily violate \"explicit is better than implicit\" as long as that default is predictable and well-documented.  With the locale-based encoding it isn't that, even though I personally would prefer it in most cases.\n\nAnd yes, I realize I've previously argued for the opposite--I think with good reasons--but now I've convinced myself the other way around.  Take it with a grain of salt though; if you'd prefer not to change things again I can undo that.  It just makes the code a little more complicated unfortunately.",

All programs start out in the "C" locale (i.e. ASCII) by default.  In Python 2 the interpreter only temporarily enables the user's locale in order to determine what to use for "filesystem encoding", but then switches back to the default.  That is, if you want Python to use anything other than the "C" locale (or at least any non-ASCII encoding from the locale) you have to at least manually call `setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")` at least once.  Python 3, however, does exactly this during interpreter startup, which makes a major difference.

3) While it's true that Python uses `locale.getpreferredencoding()` in lots of places as the default encoding (most notably `open()`) I've found so far with these utility functions that they don't have a lot of impact w.r.t. file I/O.  In the past, the most challenging Python 3 ports I've worked on have had a lot to do with file I/O which is why this was heavily on my mind, but so far in porting Sage this has been less of any issue. 

4) It might actually be saner and more predictable to defaulting to UTF-8, especially when a user explicitly passes some non-ASCII unicode text to a function that is supposed to support unicode, if the user's locale is non-unicode they may get encoding errors.  

Relatedly, having a default does not necessarily violate "explicit is better than implicit" as long as that default is predictable and well-documented.  With the locale-based encoding it isn't that, even though I personally would prefer it in most cases.

And yes, I realize I've previously argued for the opposite--I think with good reasons--but now I've convinced myself the other way around.  Take it with a grain of salt though; if you'd prefer not to change things again I can undo that.  It just makes the code a little more complicated unfortunately.

While I would also prefer to write the code as independent as possible I'm not sure I follow your suggestion here.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  `str_to_bytes` really shouldn't accept `bytes` on Python 3.

The error message would be wrong on Python 3 since there is no "unicode" (and this error message is intended for users who would normally be writing plain Python, not Cython).  That's why I have slightly different duplicates of this code.

-IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION >= 3:
-    cdef extern from "Python.h":
-        # Missing from cpython.unicode in Cython 0.27.3
-        char* PyUnicode_AsUTF8(object s)
+
+cdef extern from "Python.h":
+    # Missing from cpython.unicode in Cython 0.27.3
+    char* PyUnicode_AsUTF8(object s)
```

`PyUnicode_AsUTF8` doesn't exist on Python 2 so I'm not sure why you removed this check.  I'm not sure if that actually matters from Cython's end though.

Looks good to me otherwise in principle; I just want to test it on my Python 3 branch.

I removed it because I want to upstream that declaration and Cython doesn't differentiate between Python 2 and Python 3.

No, it doesn't.
