Two unrelated but (I think) small updates in `sage.libs.ntl`.  With these fixes (among others in unrelated modules) all the tests pass for `sage.libs.ntl` in my Python 3 branch.

The update to `ntl_ZZ_pX` allows it to take as an argument any object that implements the `Sequence` protocol, instead of just `(list, tuple)` exactly.  To summarize, this means classes that implement at least `__iter__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` (though to be clear, `dict` is is not a `Sequence`).  This means, among other things, it can accept `range` objects without any additional fuss, and there were several examples of this usage in the tests.

"With these fixes *(among others in unrelated modules)*" the parenthesized part is important: these were fixes that I needed in `sage.libs.ntl` itself for those tests to pass, but this required some other fixes elsewhere as well.  I don't remember what those fixes would have been; this ticket was opened nine months ago.  I'll take another look though.  I haven't updated my Python 3 branch in too long...

Apparently not really: The issue here *is* a `map()` call in `sage.libs.ntl` which could easily be converted to a list comprehension.  I think in my python3 branch it still worked because I changed some other interfaces to accept arbitrary iterables better, which is also just as good, but I think these `map()` calls could just as well be rewritten too.
