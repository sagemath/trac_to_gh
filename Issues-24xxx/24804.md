Two unrelated but (I think) small updates in `sage.libs.ntl`.  With these fixes (among others in unrelated modules) all the tests pass for `sage.libs.ntl` in my Python 3 branch.

The update to `ntl_ZZ_pX` allows it to take as an argument any object that implements the `Sequence` protocol, instead of just `(list, tuple)` exactly.  To summarize, this means classes that implement at least `__iter__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` (though to be clear, `dict` is is not a `Sequence`).  This means, among other things, it can accept `range` objects without any additional fuss, and there were several examples of this usage in the tests.

Depends on #26769

This is still pretty arbitrary.  I think it would be nice to at least have defined in one place a tuple of all the common sequence types both built into Python and maybe from Sage as well (e.g. vectors).

In lots of other places we have not explicitly added support for range arguments, so why in this one place?

"With these fixes *(among others in unrelated modules)*" the parenthesized part is important: these were fixes that I needed in `sage.libs.ntl` itself for those tests to pass, but this required some other fixes elsewhere as well.  I don't remember what those fixes would have been; this ticket was opened nine months ago.  I'll take another look though.  I haven't updated my Python 3 branch in too long...

Looking at the Python code and C-API docs, there is in fact a C-level `PySequence` API: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/sequence.html

I believe it would be very useful to provide some thin wrappers around this to support sequence-like types generically, but more efficiently than going through the full `isinstance` check and ABC support (which is something I think still worth looking into making faster).

Apparently not really: The issue here *is* a `map()` call in `sage.libs.ntl` which could easily be converted to a list comprehension.  I think in my python3 branch it still worked because I changed some other interfaces to accept arbitrary iterables better, which is also just as good, but I think these `map()` calls could just as well be rewritten too.
