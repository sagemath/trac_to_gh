Let's add the test by Rivin to check whether a polyhedral graph is the graph of a circumscribed polyhedron. (And also for inscribed polyhedra). It's a fairly straightforward LP. 

I think it would be good to add this to graphs and also to polyhedra. 

Keywords: polytopes, polyhedra, planar graphs

I create the undirected graph for one reason only: I want to iterate over all_simple_cycles of the (undirected) graph. There doesn't seem to be a method for that, but for digraphs, there is such a method; therefore I iterate over all simple cycles of the directed version of the graph and throw away the cycles of type `[x,y,x]`, i.e. of length `3` and also I get every simple cycle of the original graph twice. This is why I collect the inequalities and equations as sets first, to avoid having each constraint twice. 

This does not mean that the definition makes sense for directed graph; it is in the right place
> More importantly, is it useful ?

I think this is an interesting property not so much for graphs, but for polyhedra. But it only depends on the graph of the polyhedra, which is why I put it in graph.py and not in the polyhedra section. The most useful call will be something like `P.graph().is_inscribable()` for a polyhedron P; (which could then be shortened to P.is_inscribable()). (Notice that there is already a method `is_inscribed`, so at least some people are interested in these kinds of questions)

The reason is that the variables-dictionary given by `M.new_variable()` for a MILP `M` don't seem to be flexible enough to handle complicated keys.

I want the results to be accurate: Using a numerical solver might lead to incorrect results, especially because I am checking in end if the result is positive. Using exact arithmetic over the rationals and comparing against zero in the end will be slower but hopefully gives the correct result.

I tried to explain it a bit better and also gave a link to a write-up by David Eppstein. (https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/uninscribable/)
I hope this helps; I am looking forward to your other comments..
Thanks again!

<a id='comment:11'></a>At the beginning of method `is_circumscribable`, you have `G = self.to_undirected()` but you  don't use `G` afterward, and self is undirected. I suspect that you want to remove loops and multiple edges. If so, you should use `G` in the following.

Concerning `vertices_dict`, the variables-dictionary given by `M.new_variable()` **is** flexible enough to accept any hashable type. So you don't need this dictionary.

I suggest to rewrite the code as:

```
    M = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True, solver="ppl")
    e = M.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
    c = M.new_variable()
    M.set_min(c[0], -1)
    M.set_max(c[0], 1)
    M.set_objective(c[0])

    for u,v in self.edge_iterator(labels=0):
        if u > v:
            u,v = v,u
        M.set_max(e[u,v], ZZ(1)/ZZ(2))
        M.add_constraint(e[u,v] - c[0], min=0)
        M.add_constraint(e[u,v] + c[0], max=ZZ(1)/ZZ(2))

    from sage.misc.flatten import flatten
    # The faces are completely determined by the graph structure:
    # for polyhedral graph, there is only one way to choose the faces.
    efaces = self.faces()
    vfaces = [flatten(face) for face in efaces]
    
    # In order to generate all simple cycles of G, we use the "all_simple_cycles"
    # method of directed graphs, generating each cycle twice (in both directions)
    # The two sets below make sure only one direction gives rise to an (in)equality
    D = self.to_directed()
    equality_constraints = set()
    inequality_constraints = set()
    for cycle in D.all_simple_cycles():
        if len(cycle) > 3:
            edges = (tuple(sorted([cycle[i], cycle[i+1]])) for i in range(len(cycle)-1))
            scycle = set(cycle)
            if any(scycle.issubset(_) for _ in vfaces):
                equality_constraints.add(edges)
            else:
                inequality_constraints.add(edges)

    for eq in equality_constraints:
        M.add_constraint(M.sum(e[_] for _ in eq) == 1)
    for ieq in inequality_constraints:
        M.add_constraint(M.sum(e[_] for _ in ieq) - c[0] >= 1)
```

This code is working (I tried), and I find it easier to read.

Do we agree that 
- the equality constraints are exactly the faces
- any simple cycle that is not a face induces an inequality constraint

If so, why using `issubset` ?  

Otherwise, we could do something like:

```
    vfaces = set(Set(flatten(face)) for face in efaces)
    
    # In order to generate all simple cycles of G, we use the "all_simple_cycles"
    # method of directed graphs, generating each cycle twice (in both directions)
    # The two sets below make sure only one direction gives rise to an (in)equality
    D = self.to_directed()
    equality_constraints = set()
    inequality_constraints = set()
    for cycle in D.all_simple_cycles():
        if len(cycle) > 3:
            edges = (tuple(sorted([cycle[i], cycle[i+1]])) for i in range(len(cycle)-1))
            if not Set(cycle) in vfaces:
                equality_constraints.add(edges)
            else:
                inequality_constraints.add(edges)
```
and we can even save set `equality_constraints` since it is duplicate of `efaces`.

No, I simply forgot to delete that file when moving the method from generic_graph to graph. Graph with loops and multiple edges are caught by the is_polyhedral test before.

Great! I don't know anymore why I was thinking these dictionary weren't flexible enough.

I adopted all your changes, they do make the code more readable! Not all doctest worked with what you had, but after added `set` to the following line 

```
vfaces = [set(flatten(face)) for face in efaces]
```
and modifying a few things, everything now works again. Also, your version generated all the inequalities for non-facial cycles twice; I added a `frozenset` to remedy this. (I had `tuple(sorted(edges))` before.)

Yes!

Not using it anymore..

done, the equalities are now treated directly from efaces before

 
Thank you: this certainly improved the code!

<a id='comment:14'></a>Please add an empty line after `M.add_constraint(M.sum(e[tuple(sorted(_))] for _ in edges) == 1)`.

`vfaces` should be a set, not a list. Testing if an item is in a list takes linear time in the size of the list, and much less in a set. See the example below.

```
sage: L = list(range(1000))
sage: shuffle(L)
sage: S = set(L)
sage: %time all(i in L for i in L)
CPU times: user 7.08 ms, sys: 423 µs, total: 7.5 ms
Wall time: 7.19 ms
True
sage: %time all(i in S for i in L)
CPU times: user 304 µs, sys: 182 µs, total: 486 µs
Wall time: 329 µs
True
```

So I propose to use

```
vfaces = set(frozenset(flatten(face)) for face in efaces))
```
and

```
            if len(cycle) > 3:
                scycle = frozenset(cycle)
                if scycle not in vfaces:
                    edges = (tuple(sorted([cycle[i], cycle[i+1]])) for i in range(len(cycle)-1))
                    inequality_constraints.add(frozenset(edges))
```
We need to use `frozenset` (or `Set`) since this type is hashable, and so we can have a set of frozensets.

Observe that since `cycle` is a list, we can do `scycle = frozenset(cycle)`. No need to flatten the cycle first.

In the description of the method, you could add after `by solving a linear program`

```
that assigns weights between 0 and 1/2 on each edge of the polyhedron, so that the weights on any face add to exactly one and the weights on any non-facial cycle add to more than one. If this can be done, the polyhedron can be circumscribed.
```

Nice! Now I avoid flattening lists also when generating the list  
`vfaces = set(frozenset([_[0] for _ in face]) for face in efaces)'
Using `flatten` instead of `[_[0] for _ in face]` leads to errors when the vertices of the Graph are lists themselves (as often happens when looking at the planar dual). Now it works.

<a id='comment:17'></a>This is much better, but I have further comments (sorry):
- please ensure that the comments are written in 80 columns mode. The line `A polyhedron is circumscribed if all of its facets are tangent to a sphere.` exceeds the 80th column.

- In the examples, you could add

```
sage: O = graphs.OctahedralGraph()
sage: 0.is_circumscribable()
True
```

- in the example of `is_inscribable`:

```
sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
sage: v = next(C.vertex_iterator())
sage: triangle = [_ + v for _ in C.neighbors(v)]
```
Honestly, I don't understand the transformation, but it's not important.

May be it would be more informative to have:

```
sage: C = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
sage: C.is_inscribable()
True
sage: C.planar_dual().is_inscribable()
True
sage: H = graphs.HerschelGraph()
sage: H.is_inscribable()               # long time (> 1 sec)
False
sage: H.planar_dual().is_inscribable() # long time (> 1 sec)
True
```

I added some more examples that I find pretty instructive. They include the smallest examples of non-(in/circum)scribable graphs. (Another would be dual to the truncated tetrahedron: the stacked tetrahedron, a.k.a. Triakis tetradhedron (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_tetrahedron), which is not inscribed. But I don't know how to get the graph easily, except `polytopes.truncated_tetrahedron().graph().planar_dual()` or `polytopes.truncated_tetrahedron().polar().graph()` of course..)

Thank you for looking at the code so closely!
