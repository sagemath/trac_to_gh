This looks wrong:

```
sage: arccosh(0.9)
NaN
```

Especially given all the following:

```
sage: arccosh(RDF(0.9))
0.45102681179626236*I
```

```
sage: arccosh(x).subs(x=0.9)
0.451026811796262*I
```

```
sage: sqrt(-2.0)
1.41421356237310*I
```

A complex number is more useful than a `NaN` so we shouldn't return `NaN` in the first example.

The `Function` code first calls `x.arccosh()` which returns the `NaN`. The reason for only the RDF case working is that RDF does not have a `arccosh` member function so the computation is delegated to Pynac where the complex value is returned.

Depends on #24832

This would mean either 1. changing general evaluation of `f(arg)` to not try `arg.f()` first or, 2. changing the interface to `mpfr_acosh()` (which is responsible for the NaN), i.e. `RR.arccosh()`, and some others too.

I'm in favor of the latter.

Changes in symbolics code are quite likely to produce doctest differences in the fricas interface, so it might make sense to make sure that these doctests are run.

In the case at hand, I guess it would be very important to specify domain and codomain of expressions which can be evaluated numerically, otherwise it will never be clear whether something is a bug or a feature.

Besides, I think that `arccosh` is terrible language :-)

I don't care what you do with the function `arccosh` but **all** of

```
sage: RR(0.9).arccosh()
NaN
sage: RBF(0.9).arccosh()
nan
sage: RIF(0.9).arccosh()

That is however the reason for

and all the others because here (1.1).acos() is called first.

In this situation you could just fallback to `acosh`

Instead of special casing I'd rather change the name of the inverse hyperbolic functions away from all the wrong `arc`s (arcus) to the `a`s and have `ar` (area) aliases which would be the correct prefix.

Moreover, if I get a review on the change to always delegate to `_eval_()` (EDITED) if NaN is returned then I'd change that too.
