This looks wrong:

```
sage: arccosh(0.9)
NaN
```

Especially given all the following:

```
sage: arccosh(RDF(0.9))
0.45102681179626236*I
```

```
sage: arccosh(x).subs(x=0.9)
0.451026811796262*I
```

```
sage: sqrt(-2.0)
1.41421356237310*I
```

A complex number is more useful than a `NaN` so we shouldn't return `NaN` in the first example.

The `Function` code first calls `x.arccosh()` which returns the `NaN`. The reason for only the RDF case working is that RDF does not have a `arccosh` member function so the computation is delegated to Pynac where the complex value is returned.

This would mean either 1. changing general evaluation of `f(arg)` to not try `arg.f()` first or, 2. changing the interface to `mpfr_acosh()` (which is responsible for the NaN), i.e. `RR.arccosh()`, and some others too.

I'm in favor of the latter.

In the case at hand, I guess it would be very important to specify domain and codomain of expressions which can be evaluated numerically, otherwise it will never be clear whether something is a bug or a feature.

Besides, I think that `arccosh` is terrible language :-)

That is however the reason for

In this situation you could just fallback to `acosh`

```
sage: RDF(0.9).acosh()
NaN
```

Instead of special casing I'd rather change the name of the inverse hyperbolic functions away from all the wrong `arc`s (arcus) to the `a`s and have `ar` (area) aliases which would be the correct prefix.

Moreover, if I get a review on the change to always delegate to `_eval_()` (EDITED) if NaN is returned then I'd change that too.

 A complex number is more useful than a `NaN` so we shouldn't return `NaN` in the first example.

In this situation you could just fallback to

```
sage: RDF(0.9).acosh()
NaN
```
