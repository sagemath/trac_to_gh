DynkinDiagram calls CartanMatrix with all its arguments (*args) (see line 181 in dynkin_diagram.py) which causes error with relabeling for A1. It works correctly for higher rank.

`DynkinDiagram(CartanMatrix([This is the Trac macro *2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#2-macro)), ["a"])`


The following produces DynkinDiagram labeled by numbers in range(1, len(index_set)).

`DynkinDiagram(CM, index_set=['a'])`
