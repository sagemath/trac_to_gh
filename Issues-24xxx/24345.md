The `Unknown` from `misc/unknown.py` incorrectly behaves like `False` in the context of boolean operations. It is mostly useless as long as Python has no tristate conditionals and logic operators. This ticket raises an error instead.

As a consequence of this modification, Sage code is adapted as follows for a given tristate `troolean`

```
if troolean is True:
    ...
elif troolean is False:
    ...
else:
    ...
```

I'm not sure that there is actually a bug here...

To me, requiring people to write `foo() is True` is a bigger problem than treating `Unknown` as false.

`Unknown` is broken. The only reasonable proposals are in order of decreasing preference (to me):
- make Python troolean compatible
- the proposal of this ticket
- remove completely `Unknown`

I definitely support the changes from this ticket.

```
if troolean:

else:
    # here troolean = Unknown

It would be so much better to patch Python!

From the documentation of `designs.differenf_family`

```
    - ``existence`` -- if ``True``, then return either ``True`` if Sage knows
      how to build such design, ``Unknown`` if it does not and ``False`` if it
      knows that the design does not exist.
```
Hence, the `isinstance(ret, tuple)` should not be needed in

```
+        ....:             ret = designs.difference_family(v,k,l,existence=True)
+        ....:             if ret is True or isinstance(ret, tuple):
```
There is indeed a bug in the design code (see #24513)

```
sage: designs.difference_family(3,2,1, existence=True)   # should be True
(Ring of integers modulo 3, [[1, 2]])
```

Could you document more carefully the behavior of `Unknown` class? Especially in the design and stronly regular graph codes where you need to write

```
my_function(params, existence=True) is True
```
and not simply

my_function(params, existence=True)

You should also test `True | Unknown` as well as `False | Unknown`.

`__not__` is by no way a special Python method. It would better be removed.

NotImplemented

Precisely: when `x.__or__(y)` returns `NotImplemented` Python automatically calls `y.__or__(x)`.
