The `Unknown` from `misc/unknown.py` incorrectly behaves like `False` in the context of boolean operations. It is mostly useless as long as Python has no tristate conditionals and logic operators. This ticket raises an error instead.

As a consequence of this modification, Sage code is adapted as follows for a given tristate `troolean`

```
if troolean is True:
    ...
elif troolean is False:
    ...
else:
    ...
```

`Unknown` is broken. The only reasonable proposals are in order of decreasing preference (to me):

- the proposal of this ticket
- remove completely `Unknown`

I definitely support the changes from this ticket.

<div id="comment:16" align="right">Comment 16</div>

From the documentation of `designs.differenf_family`

```
    - ``existence`` -- if ``True``, then return either ``True`` if Sage knows
      how to build such design, ``Unknown`` if it does not and ``False`` if it
      knows that the design does not exist.
```
Hence, the `isinstance(ret, tuple)` should not be needed in

```
+        ....:             ret = designs.difference_family(v,k,l,existence=True)
+        ....:             if ret is True or isinstance(ret, tuple):
```
There is indeed a bug in the design code (see #24513)

```
sage: designs.difference_family(3,2,1, existence=True)   # should be True
(Ring of integers modulo 3, [[1, 2]])
```

Could you document more carefully the behavior of `Unknown` class? Especially in the design and stronly regular graph codes where you need to write

my_function(params, existence=True) is True

my_function(params, existence=True)

Precisely: when `x.__or__(y)` returns `NotImplemented` Python automatically calls `y.__or__(x)`.

For reference, here is the implementation for `__or__` for booleans

```
static PyObject *
bool_or(PyObject *a, PyObject *b)
{
    if (!PyBool_Check(a) || !PyBool_Check(b))
        return PyLong_Type.tp_as_number->nb_or(a, b);
    return PyBool_FromLong((a == Py_True) | (b == Py_True));
}
```
