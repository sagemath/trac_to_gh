Despite what you think, you are not using mpfr, but PARI:

```python
    def arccosh(self):
        """
        Return the hyperbolic arccosine of ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: (1+CC(I)).arccosh()
            1.06127506190504 + 0.904556894302381*I
        """
        return self._parent(self.__pari__().acosh())
```

If you want to compare with something, it should be mpc (in Sage: `CC = MPComplexField(53)`)

Pynac is not involved in the numerics (`hypergeometric_U` is not a `GinacFunction`), so the hypothesis is that the expression before `.n()` is different with 32bit pynac-0.7.22.

This isn't really about this specific ticket (thanks for putting in the work for the upgrade), but is there a reason everybody seems to make seperate "pkg version / chksum" and "doctest fixes" patches?

Shouldn't each commit be one unit of changes for which the doctests still pass?
