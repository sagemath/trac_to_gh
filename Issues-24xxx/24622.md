This ticket implements pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, i.e. real differentiable manifolds equipped with a metric tensor. Important subcases are of course Riemannian manifolds and Lorentzian manifolds. Taking into account that pseudo-Riemannian metric tensors are already implemented in Sage (see [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/metric.html)), this ticket introduces

- the parent class `PseudoRiemannianManifold`, as a subclass of the existing class `DifferentiableManifold`, with the specific methods `metric` and `volume_form`
- new methods `gradient`, `laplacian` and `dalembertian` for scalar fields
- new methods `divergence`, `laplacian` and `dalembertian` for tensor fields 
- new methods `curl`, `dot_product`, `cross_product` and `norm` for vector fields

For a greater generality, all these methods have an optional argument `metric`; if it is omitted, the metric of the underlying pseudo-Riemannian manifold is assumed. 

To match with the standard functional notation, functions `grad`, `div`, `curl`, `laplacian` and `dalembertian` have been implemented in `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/operators.py`. Their role is simply to call the corresponding methods on their arguments. In order not to clutter the global namespace in a standard Sage session, these functions are imported only if some pseudo-Riemannian manifold is constructed, via the call to  `sage.repl.user_globals.set_global` in `PseudoRiemannianManifold.__init__`. 

Some vector calculus functionalities introduced by this ticket are
demonstrated in this [Jupyter worksheet](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/vector_calculus.ipynb).

The follow-up ticket #24623 implements Euclidean spaces.

This work is part of the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), see #18528 for an overview.

    "body": "<a id='comment:15'></a>\nThe biggest issue I have with this ticket is the addition of functions to the global namespace. `curl`, `laplacian`, and `dalembertian` I think are okay. `grad` over `gradient` I am not sure about. `div` looks too much like it is coming from \"divide\" or \"division\". I think you should ask on sage-devel to see if anyone has any objections with adding these to the global namespace and about them being a simple re-direct. (Ralf may want to have them interact with the symbolics in some way.)\n\nIn the same vein, this is bad to me:\n\n```python\n        # Import differential operators in the user global namespace:\n        if 'grad' not in get_globals():\n            from sage.manifolds.differentiable.operators import (grad, div,\n                                                 curl, laplacian, dalembertian)\n            set_global('grad', grad)\n            set_global('div', div)\n            set_global('curl', curl)\n            set_global('rot', curl)\n            set_global('laplacian', laplacian)\n            set_global('dalembertian', dalembertian)\n```\nI think a much better way is just to either have them all in the global namespace at start or having some function `inject_functions()`, but with some better name than I can come up with in 5 seconds.\n\n---\n\nOther small comments:\n\nThis is under-indetented:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py b/src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py\nindex 63ace1d..d8d173c 100644\n--- a/src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py\n+++ b/src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py\n@@ -3087,9 +3087,9 @@ class TensorField(ModuleElement):\n \n         ..

The biggest issue I have with this ticket is the addition of functions to the global namespace. `curl`, `laplacian`, and `dalembertian` I think are okay. `grad` over `gradient` I am not sure about. `div` looks too much like it is coming from "divide" or "division". I think you should ask on sage-devel to see if anyone has any objections with adding these to the global namespace and about them being a simple re-direct. (Ralf may want to have them interact with the symbolics in some way.)

In the same vein, this is bad to me:

```python
        # Import differential operators in the user global namespace:
        if 'grad' not in get_globals():
            from sage.manifolds.differentiable.operators import (grad, div,
                                                 curl, laplacian, dalembertian)
            set_global('grad', grad)
            set_global('div', div)
            set_global('curl', curl)
            set_global('rot', curl)
            set_global('laplacian', laplacian)
            set_global('dalembertian', dalembertian)
```
I think a much better way is just to either have them all in the global namespace at start or having some function `inject_functions()`, but with some better name than I can come up with in 5 seconds.

I agree that `div` may evoke "division", however `grad` and `div` are pretty much standard notations in both elementary vector calculus and differential geometry, see e.g. 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#Differential_operators
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities#Operator_notations
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence

As a side note, neither `grad` nor `div` is already used as a global function in Sage, so the slot is free.

Why is it bad? Is it because it prevents the user from discovering the grad function with the TAB key and/or `grad?` before having set up any pseudo-Riemannian manifold? This would indeed be a good reason to have the operators in the global namespace at start.

The difference is that in those links, you know you are doing vector calculus, whereas in Python you have `operator.div`.

You should not inject them without the user knowing. In particular, what if you have `rot = some expensive computation`, then you create your manifold (with not having created a `grad`) and all of a sudden, your `rot` computation is gone. On the other side, what if we add a different `grad` to the global namespace, something I think could happen, then you will not get these injections.

I agree that they should be in the global namespace from the start and would making this issue moot. Some other thoughts that come to my mind is a function like `setup_manifolds_environment` and/or getting people who use SageManifolds to have a specific section to their `.sage/init.sage` file.

Thanks for these explanations. I totally overlooked this point... I am now 100% convinced that injecting silently names in the global namespace is a very bad thing.

I'll think about this, given that the discussion on sage-devel leans toward not adding new stuff in the global namespace.
