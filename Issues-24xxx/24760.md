Thanks for the hints. I have changed the code accordingly.

But alas, this is still not doing what it should. Namely, I would like to use a global variable, but of course this does not make much sense..

The problem is that it must distinguish between clicks on the numbers at top (first parameter k) that means 'doing a mutation at vertex k" (changing the displayed graph) to clicks on the other checkboxes, that just mean display or not a few additional fixes, but do not perform any mutation.

Pro tip: if you are thinking about using ipywidgets interacts non-trivially, you shouldn't be using interacts.

There is a difference in philosophy between sagenb interact and ipywidgets interacts: with sagenb, the only way to do anything with widgets is to use `@interact`. This leads to ugly solutions such as the old code for the cluster interact (did you see how it abuses the lists `sft, sss, ssv ssm, ssl`?)

With ipywidgets on the other hand, the widgets are the basic building blocks. There is a lot of stuff you can do with widgets without using `@interact`. They do provide an interact function for convenience, but it's really just a wrapper over the underlying widgets. You might as well wrap the widgets yourself.

In more detail: when you add `@interact` to a function, it gets an attribute `.widget` which is an instance of `ipywidgets.widgets.interaction.interactive`:

```
sage: from ipywidgets import interact
sage: @interact
....: def f(x=0, y=True, z=range(4)): pass
[SageTerminalApp] WARNING | Widget Javascript not detected.  It may not be installed or enabled properly.
Widget Javascript not detected.  It may not be installed or enabled properly.
sage: widget = f.widget
sage: type(widget)
<class 'ipywidgets.widgets.interaction.interactive'>
```
This widget is really just a special vertical box of widgets:

```
sage: type(f.widget).__bases__
(<class 'ipywidgets.widgets.widget_box.VBox'>,)
sage: f.widget.children
(IntSlider(value=0, min=0, max=1, step=1, description=u'x'),
 Checkbox(value=True, description=u'y'),
 Dropdown(value=0, options=[0, 1, 2, 3], description=u'z'),
 Output())
```
If you would manually construct a `VBox` of those 4 widgets, you would already get the interact but without the callbacks to make it interactive and to display the output.

Great, thanks for making this work again! -- everything seems to work as expected.

Concerning the usage, I have two issues that I believe had worked better before:

1. currently nothing is shown when initially running `S.interact()`. The quiver and the additional info only show after the first mutation.

2. the "window" showing the buttons and the info seems to be of a fixed height, so I have to do a mutation and then scroll down inside this window as shown in https://screenshots.firefox.com/nTDuxI5z46neAILs/localhost

I cannot review the code whatsoever, but the usage is fine (and the two issues are only worth solving if they are easily fixed).

Regarding

```
        # not clear how to get the right behaviour here
        # doing both has some side effects (one click : two mutations)
        mut_buttons.on_msg(do_mutation)
        mut_buttons.observe(do_mutation, 'value')

is it not sufficient to keep only the `on_msg()` call?

I have done a copy-paste for the `ClusterQuiver` interact, but removing the variables.

Clicking on 0 will work when ipywidgets is updated.

For labels, maybe this can wait. I propose to keep more enhancements for a later ticket. The really important task done here is to get rid of the import of sagenb, to move towards python3. 

EDIT: bot is morally green

If you need to copy/paste code, you're doing it wrong.

Why not factor this out into a subclass or separate function?

Could we not backport the upstream patch?
