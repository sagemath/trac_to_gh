Usually relabeling works nice but when one wants to relabel with symbolic variables the index set is in wrong order. The index set of the associated CartanType is however correct.

```
D = DynkinDiagram("A3")
print(D)
print(D.index_set())
var('a', 'b', 'c')
rsD = D.relabel({1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'})
print(rsD)
print(rsD.index_set())
rD = D.relabel({1:a, 2:b, 3:c})
print(rD)
print(rD.index_set())
print(rD.cartan_type().index_set())
```

This is not a bug as the ordering of the index set (which the ordering does not matter because it is a set) is determined by the vertices of the Dynkin diagram.

One needs an implicit ordering for the Cartan matrix. Also, anyone who does stuff with Lie/Coxeter types that I know would want this to be called `index_set`. Also, working with (frozen)sets is slower (and can be more difficult to work with) for common operations with the index set such as iteration. 

There is no loss of generality for fixing an order, but why should one order be preferred over another? You are also getting different relabelings because the types are different too, so there is not really an inconsistency.
