Usually relabeling works nice but when one wants to relabel with symbolic variables the index set is in wrong order. The index set of the associated CartanType is however correct.

```
D = DynkinDiagram("A3")
print(D)
print(D.index_set())
var('a', 'b', 'c')
rsD = D.relabel({1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'})
print(rsD)
print(rsD.index_set())
rD = D.relabel({1:a, 2:b, 3:c})
print(rD)
print(rD.index_set())
print(rD.cartan_type().index_set())
```

This is not a bug as the ordering of the index set (which the ordering does not matter because it is a set) is determined by the vertices of the Dynkin diagram.

There is no loss of generality for fixing an order, but why should one order be preferred over another? You are also getting different relabelings because the types are different too, so there is not really an inconsistency.
