Usually relabeling works nice but when one wants to relabel with symbolic variables the index set is in wrong order. The index set of the associated CartanType is however correct.

```
D = DynkinDiagram("A3")
print(D)
print(D.index_set())
var('a', 'b', 'c')
rsD = D.relabel({1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'})
print(rsD)
print(rsD.index_set())
rD = D.relabel({1:a, 2:b, 3:c})
print(rD)
print(rD.index_set())
print(rD.cartan_type().index_set())
```

This is not a bug as the ordering of the index set (which the ordering does not matter because it is a set) is determined by the vertices of the Dynkin diagram.
