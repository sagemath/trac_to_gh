This ticket implements the automorphism group of finite abelian groups.
Methods should include:
- generators 
- subgroups
- it is essentially a matrix group so the implementation can reflect that.
- an action on the elements of the underlying abelian group.
- in gap there is a method `AbelianGroupAutomorphismGroup`. We could wrap that.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I made one non-trivial change: I removed the ``@`cached_method` from the `automorphism_group()` since the caching is (better) handled by the `UniqueRepresentation`.

The rest of my changes are just some simple cleanup of the doc and code.

If my changes look good, then positive review.
