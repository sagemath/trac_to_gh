It turns out that Linbox compiles with `-std=gnu++11` but not with `-std=c++11`:

To make this fact explicit and to fix #23919, I propose to add `-std=gnu++11` to the CXXFLAGS of Linbox.

For the record: when compiling LinBox (and fflas-ffpack and givaro) with clang-3.8 and using the glibc++ v>=6 (IIRC), we hit a bug when the `--std=gnu++11` as the compiler does not support the `__float128` type.
See https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/issues/47

Replacing `std=gnu++11` by `std=c++11` in this case solves the problem.
Hence, we let givaro/fflas/linbox configure scripts select which option to use and properly export it in the pc files (in upstream version of the lib).

I think this ticket is still good to go for the current version of linbox shipped in Sage, and assuming that one compiles with gcc, but it will probably be removed when the new versions will be ported to sage (which I am working on now). I am just a little worried about having the main sage configure script forcing the `gnu++11` option unconditionally.

We don't force anything. Actually we stopped `spkg-install` from forcing `-std=c++98/gnu++98`, it now default to whatever `configure` default to. We only force `gnu++11` in the sage library. I guess I'll see what happens with clang in #12426.

Replying to [comment:8 fbissey]:
> We only force `gnu++11` in the sage library. 

But since linbox/fflas are source libraries, they are compiled bits by bits while compiling the sage library, and it would therefore require to use the appropriate c++11 flag that linbox/fflas will expose in their pc files.
