Because there is no conversion implemented between some fields this ticket adds fallback code that goes through a RR/CC intermediate. Example:

```
sage: SR(CBF(1+I))._convert({'parent':CDF})
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleField_class' object has no attribute 'complex_field'
```


Depends on #24318

For me it is: this proposal is hiding missing conversions that will remain unknown.


Again: the aim of the symbolic ring is not to be better than the rest of Sage. If a conversion does not exist, then it does not exist. It might be a bug, a mistake, but it is not the role of the symbolic ring to complete the conversion.
