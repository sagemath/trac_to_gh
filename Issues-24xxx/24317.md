You are pretending that it is successful. Conversion is not a trivial task. Going through an intermediate ring is not innocent (especially with floating point).

> Moreover this can handle cases that are unknown at the moment.


For me it is: this proposal is hiding missing conversions that will remain unknown.


Again: the aim of the symbolic ring is not to be better than the rest of Sage. If a conversion does not exist, then it does not exist. It might be a bug, a mistake, but it is not the role of the symbolic ring to complete the conversion.
