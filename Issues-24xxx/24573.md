with the branch in #24512, which changes the implementation of WheelGraph, one has

```
sage: M = Matroid(range(8),graphs.WheelGraph(5))
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[1,2])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   1593         edgelist = self.groundset_to_edges(X)

    776 
    777         elif e[0] == u:

ValueError: the edges are not all incident with u
```
which indicates an inconsistency in creation of M.
Indeed, the following works:

```
sage: M = Matroid(graphs.WheelGraph(5))
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[(0,2),(0,3)])
Graphic matroid of rank 5 on 9 elements
```

isn't there a documentation bug:

   A coextension in a graphic matroid is the opposite of contracting
   an edge; that is, vertices are merged, and a new edge is added
   between them. This method will split a vertex, and move the edges
   indicated by "X" to the new vertex.
```
This `vertices are merged, and a new edge is added` makes no sense to me. It seems that one started talking about what an edge contraction means, as merging happens in edge contraction, stopped half-way, and switched to describing coextension.

And while I am at it, isn't `edges of "u"` in description of `X` too informal? Should it be `edges incident to "u"` ?

Given the discussion in #24512, I'm not sure what needs to be changed in the code, if anything. The doctest was fixed already so future changes to `WheelGraph()` won't upset it.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A1):

Yes, that's an error. How about this: 

 ```
    A coextension in a graphic matroid is the opposite of contracting
    an edge; that is, a vertex is split, and a new edge is added
    between the resulting vertices. This method will create a new vertex
    adjacent to "u", and move the edges indicated by "X" from "u"
    to the new vertex.
 ```

> And while I am at it, isn't `edges of "u"` in description of `X` too informal? Should it be `edges incident to "u"` ?

I suppose it's not standard, but I think the meaning is unambiguous. The phrase "edges of" only makes sense followed by a set of edges or an object that implies a set of edges (such as a graph), and I think there's only one set of edges that a vertex implies. But sure, we can change it since we're changing things.
