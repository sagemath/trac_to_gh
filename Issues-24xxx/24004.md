Currently `graphs()` is an iterator that can be used to find an example of the smallest cardinality of a graph with given properties. It is unlogical that the same does not work for directed graphs.

There was no `copy` parameter for digraph generation. I added it and also made it a default, just like undirected graph generation already have. It is safer this way.

Also there was wrong indentation in the docstring.

"If for any graph G satisfying the property, every subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one edge - -", says the documentation. That is, the generation works only for "hereditary" properties.

This is actually somewhat complicated area. An example:

Every graph can be dismantled by removing one vertex a time until the single vertex graph is left, so every graph can be built by adding one vertex a time. Now let's suppose you optimize and only add vertex `i` if the degree of it is at least the degree of vertex `i-1`. It works, but if you generate connected graphs, it wont, as there is one 6-vertex graph that will not be generated.

The input for `canaug_traverse_*` seems frightening... Not sure if I can handle it yet.

There are solution à la `graphs.nauty_geng` that can be used. On the webpage of nauty, http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/, the user's guide indicate that `directg` generates small digraphs with given underlying graph, and that `watercluster2` is a faster alternative to `directg` written by Gunnar Brinkmann. We might use such implementation do generate digraphs with non hereditary properties (`nauty_geng` can generate biconnected graphs).
Of course, this is for another ticket.

I also propose to let the improvement of the documentations of `canaug_traverse_*` for another ticket. 

Since the patch passes all tests and that the documentation is nicer, I give positive review.
