Currently `graphs()` is an iterator that can be used to find an example of the smallest cardinality of a graph with given properties. It is unlogical that the same does not work for directed graphs.

There was no `copy` parameter for digraph generation. I added it and also made it a default, just like undirected graph generation already have. It is safer this way.

Also there was wrong indentation in the docstring.

What you did is correct and more than useful. Thanks. However, the generator is not working as expected. For instance:

```
sage: for d in digraphs(4, property=lambda x:x.is_strongly_connected()):
....:     print d.order(),d.edges()
....:     
sage: 
```

Also, the documentation of the `canaug_traverse_vert` and `canaug_traverse_edge` methods in `graph_generators.py` must be updated (many input parameters are not documented). You could do it in this patch.

"If for any graph G satisfying the property, every subgraph, obtained from G by deleting one edge - -", says the documentation. That is, the generation works only for "hereditary" properties.

This is actually somewhat complicated area. An example:

Every graph can be dismantled by removing one vertex a time until the single vertex graph is left, so every graph can be built by adding one vertex a time. Now let's suppose you optimize and only add vertex `i` if the degree of it is at least the degree of vertex `i-1`. It works, but if you generate connected graphs, it wont, as there is one 6-vertex graph that will not be generated.

The input for `canaug_traverse_*` seems frightening... Not sure if I can handle it yet.

There are solution à la `graphs.nauty_geng` that can be used. On the webpage of nauty, http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/, the user's guide indicate that `directg` generates small digraphs with given underlying graph, and that `watercluster2` is a faster alternative to `directg` written by Gunnar Brinkmann. We might use such implementation do generate digraphs with non hereditary properties (`nauty_geng` can generate biconnected graphs).
Of course, this is for another ticket.

I also propose to let the improvement of the documentations of `canaug_traverse_*` for another ticket. 

Since the patch passes all tests and that the documentation is nicer, I give positive review.
