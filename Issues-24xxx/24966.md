```
The goal of this ticket is to

- package Kim Walish's `primecount` package (the version of `prime_pi`
  in Sage has bugs, see #24960)
- provide an experimental interface to it in `arith/prime_pi.pyx` (that will
  be merged with the current `prime_pi` in Sage in #25009).

Note that

- `primecount`'s build system uses cmake, which needs an upgrade (see #25109)
- the latest release of `primecount` should work on both big-endian and little-indian
  processors but has been tested successfully
- linking on Mac OSX looks fishy but seems to work fine

Tarball (to be renamed `primecount-4.3.tar.gz` in Sage):

- https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/archive/v4.3.tar.gz

This ticket led to opening and solving an upstream issue,
leading to improvements in the build and documentation:

- https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/issues/11

Depends on #25109

I just checked the latest release on (big-endian) SPARC, it appears to work.
(I tried ./primecount 1e11 with different algorithms, it worked)

I didn't test with OpenMP. Should I?

Build and passes its test suite on power7 - not inside a sage install, I assume I was requested to see if it was working on the hardware.

I sniffed the `CMakeList.txt` and I want someone to test it inside sage on a mac. I suspect the `install_name` are not set properly but I could miss something, so the proof is in the pudding.

This oblige to have a function `prime_pi` in let say `interfaces/primecount.pyx` to provide bindings for primecount and a `prime_pi` in `arith/prime_pi.pyx` calling the former (because we do have other `prime_pi` implementations around). primecount is made of straightforward C++ functions and it should possible to call them directly without the optional extension that you propose.",

> Exactly what Jeroen suggests, like 99% of optional packages that build a binding, put a `OptionalExtension` in `module_list_list.py`. We already deal with that particular instance of `is_package_installed` and that's not adding a new one. Look in `module_list.py` for examples of it.

As I wrote this is a nonsense. This oblige to have a function `prime_pi` in let say `interfaces/primecount.pyx` to provide bindings for primecount and a `prime_pi` in `arith/prime_pi.pyx` calling the former (because we do have other `prime_pi` implementations around). primecount is made of straightforward C++ functions and it should possible to call them directly without the optional extension that you propose.

I see. Well, I call what you do a bit of a band aid. But then we all have to start somewhere before learning better. Of course what I am about to suggest will require a significant rewrite.

You should isolate the binding to primecount in its own optional pyx/pxd files. Then, instead of having all those `HAVE_PRIMECOUNT` conditional you use a more pythonic construct 

```
try:
  import primcount_binding
except ....
```
and so on. There may be a case for using stuff from #20382, once it is merged, for this.

I don't mind significant rewrite. This is about 10 lines of code anyway.

I want to avoid `primecount_binding`. The primecount library is made of C functions `int the_function(int)` that can be directly used without any intermediate useless Python module. Such Python module would look like

```
def the_python_function(int x):
   r"""
   A doctest
   """"
   return the_C_function(x)
```
and calling any of `the_python_function` wil be an extra Python call overhead.

That symbol is not quoted directly in the source code. So it has to be generated, I think something may select the wrong version of OS X as the target. What version of xcode do you actually use? This is probably fixable.

Also and I should have mentioned that earlier can you pass the following option to cmake ` -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON` so we have a verbose output and see what it is doing during make.

On Sierra it was xcode 8.3.1.

As i have upgraded to High Sierra i can't do the tests with the verbose option right now. I need to set up a new Sierra environment first.

explaining the problem and including the log file

If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/Users/admin/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/primecount-4.3 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables

When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
