The goal of this ticket is to

- package Kim Walish's `primecount` package (the version of `prime_pi`
  in Sage has bugs, see #24960)
- provide an experimental interface to it in `arith/prime_pi.pyx` (that will
  be merged with the current `prime_pi` in Sage in #25009).

Note that

- `primecount`'s build system uses cmake, which needs an upgrade (see #25109)
- the latest release of `primecount` should work on both big-endian and little-indian
  processors but has been tested successfully
- linking on Mac OSX looks fishy but seems to work fine

Tarball (to be renamed `primecount-4.3.tar.gz` in Sage):

- https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/archive/v4.3.tar.gz

This ticket led to opening and solving an upstream issue,
leading to improvements in the build and documentation:

Yes, it would be good to have a minimal test (even just a `%%cython` command) to check that the linking works.

Exactly what Jeroen suggests, like 99% of optional packages that build a binding, put a `OptionalExtension` in `module_list_list.py`. We already deal with that particular instance of `is_package_installed` and that's not adding a new one. Look in `module_list.py` for examples of it.

You should isolate the binding to primecount in its own optional pyx/pxd files. Then, instead of having all those `HAVE_PRIMECOUNT` conditional you use a more pythonic construct 

```
try:
  import primcount_binding
except ....
```

```

<a id='comment:52'></a>That symbol is not quoted directly in the source code. So it has to be generated, I think something may select the wrong version of OS X as the target. What version of xcode do you actually use? This is probably fixable.

Also and I should have mentioned that earlier can you pass the following option to cmake ` -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON` so we have a verbose output and see what it is doing during make.

<a id='comment:53'></a>On Sierra it was xcode 8.3.1.

As i have upgraded to High Sierra i can't do the tests with the verbose option right now. I need to set up a new Sierra environment first.

Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the log file
  /Users/admin/sage/logs/pkgs/primecount-4.3.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/Users/admin/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/primecount-4.3 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '/Users/admin/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/primecount-4.3' && '/Users/admin/sage/sage' --sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
