The problem seems to lie in the assumption of all Python integer-like values will be successfully converted to a native int type (either `long` or `mpz_t`).  Otherwise methods like `numeric::is_small_power` don't work properly, and some other things break down too.

Actually `numeric::is_small_power` is called only once (from `log_eval`) and Python `numeric`s are not down-converted at all. So, to be able to confirm the bug you better please give me the concrete example.
