There is another bug I just found that only cropped up once I rebased my Python 3 branch to include #24247.

The problem seems to lie in the assumption of all Python integer-like values will be successfully converted to a native int type (either `long` or `mpz_t`).  Otherwise methods like `numeric::is_small_power` don't work properly, and some other things break down too.

Actually `numeric::is_small_power` is called only once (from `log_eval`) and Python `numeric`s are not down-converted at all. So, to be able to confirm the bug you better please give me the concrete example.

Maybe that's not exactly it, but there was something like that.  Basically the issue is that Python 2 longs / Python 3 ints were staying as Python objects and not being converted to either a C `long` or `mpz_t`.  I have a patch I just forgot to post it.
