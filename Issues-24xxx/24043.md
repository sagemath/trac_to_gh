A simple (di)graph is self-complementary if it is isomorphic to its complement. 

A self-complementary graph is connected and traceable (i.e. it contains a hamiltonian path).

This seems to be good addition... but bikeshedding follows.

IMO every Boolean-valued function should have at least one example outputting `False` (and one `True`). This function has both, but quite implicitly said. I am not sure if the basic example should have `for`-loop at all -- maybe just `PathGraph(4)` and something else.

As there has been problems with corner cases I suggest adding `TESTS` section with empty and single-vertex graphs and digraphs for testing. Also some test should have "right" number of edges but fail to be self-complementary.

`SEEALSO` blocks are mostly used for linking other functions in Sage. This kind of brokes the convention.

I would write "Check whether the graph is self-complementary." instead of "Check whether self is self-complementary". At least add the dot after sentence.
