We could have a much more friendly user interface to SAT solvers by following what has been done for MixedIntegerLinearProgram. We propose that for a given SAT solver created via `solver = SAT()` we 

- allow any Python object as a variable, ie

```
sage: solver = SAT()
sage: x = solver.new_variable()
sage: solver.add_clause([x['hello'], -x[(1,2)], x[3]])
```
  For compatibility with standard solvers, nonzero integers are also allowed, the variable `x` just provides an automatic translation from Python objects to integer.
- use `solver.solve()` instead of `solver()` (the result being either `True` or `False`)
- (unsure whether it is desirable) use `solver.get_values(x)` to get the values of the variables when the problem is SAT
