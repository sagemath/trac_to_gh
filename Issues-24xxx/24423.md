The logic in the hack to allow linear functions like `x_0 <= x_1 <= x_2` is wrong: currently, when doing `x <= y`, it first converts `x` and `y` to the correct parent and then it checks for a chained comparison. This is wrong: it should check for a chained comparison on the input of the `__richcmp__` function before converting.

One consequence is that the following does not work as expected:

```
sage: p.<x> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: from sage.numerical.linear_functions import LinearFunctionsParent
sage: LF = LinearFunctionsParent(QQ)
sage: 3 <= x[0] <= LF(4)
x_0 <= 4
```
