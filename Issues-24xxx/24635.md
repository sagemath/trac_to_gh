Sometimes it is useful to check if a graph is at least n-connected, but it is not required to calculate the vertex connectivity precisely. 

So basically, the call `G.vertex_connectivity() >= n`, should be made faster. It could perhaps be implemented by adding an option like `G.vertex_connectivity(is_at_least=n)` or something similar. 

This is used in the case n=3 for example in the functions `planar-dual` and `is_polyhedral` (see ticket:24634).

Testing if the connectivity is `>= 3` can be done in linear time using a decomposition of the graph into 3-vertex-connected components. This is one of the proposed project for GSoC 2018 https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/2018#Addition_of_SPQR-tree_to_graph_module

For larger values, we can add parameter `k` to the method to check if the vertex connectivity is `>= k`. I will try.

Same kind of functionality could be useful for, say, crossing number of a graph or dimension of a poset.

What would be parameter name for that? `k` is used in `is_eulerian()` of a poset with kind of different meaning.

And about the output: could those functions return integers of Infinity? I mean that `f(some_parameter_name=3)` would output either 0, 1, 2 or Infinity.

`k` is often good name for such parameter, as long as it is well documented.

For the output of a decision problem, it should be `True` or `False`. 
For optimization problems, you can return something else.

The modification I proposed is not so efficient. Any idea to speed up the method is welcome.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
I did some timings simliar to yours and in many cases the setting `k=...` is much faster then `.vertex_connectivity>=...`, especially if the vertex_connectity is different from "`...`".

I think it is a great addition!


A few comments, which i add as a commit:

- I suggest to allow the case `k=0` to be an alias for `is_connected`.
Do you agree? (Then an error message, the documentation and one of the Tests need to be changed slightly)


The following question has nothing to do with the new feature of the function, but while we are at it..:

- Perhaps it would be useful warn the user in the doc that the default MILP solver is not "exact".
   I propose three different ways to improve the situation:
1. add "(see `default_mip_solver()`)" with a link to sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.default_mip_solver
2. add "notice that the default solver might not be an exact solver (see `default_mip_solver()`)! To get exact (but possibly slower) results set `solver = "ppl"`"
3. Make `solver = "ppl"` the default and tell people that they have an option to set solver = None, if they want the default solver (see default_mip_solver()). 
 
  I think "1." doesn't hurt anyone and perhaps "2." is also really an imrovement. "3." would of course be a rather drastic change, that makes the method run considerably slower in the default settings.


Two more things:

- I have some minor suggestions on python conventions and also removing a forgotten ">" in the wikipedia link. 

- I rebased on beta5 in order to be able to use the method not only (as you did) in the `is_planar`, but also in the `is_polyhedral` mehtod (new in beta5!).

Good idea.

I vote for "1.". 

I doubt that using a non "exact" solver can result in a wrong answer here. Also, since calls are hidden in various methods (e.g. `is_polyhedron`), it is almost impossible for the user to choose the solver.

Thank you for the improvements.

I guess this is why the `default`-setting is quite useful; one can set the default solver globally...

I wanted to push modifications, but you have changed the branch from `public/...` to `u/moritz/...`. 


I though again about possible changes:
- `k==0`: actually this is confusing. The definition of the parameter says that we check is the connectivity is larger or equal to k. So `k=1` is to check if the graph is (strongly)connected. Allowing `k==0` might introduce some confusion to users, forcing them to carefully check the documentation each time. It's not a natural use of the method.

- I can add links to `default_mip_solver` with a sentence explaining that it allows to know which solver is used by default and to change the default solver. However, explaining the user that other solvers than `PPL` are not exact might again introduce some confusion. Furthermore, why adding it here and not in all methods using LP solvers ? The best place to add such warning might be in the global documentation of `sage.numerical.mip`.

Perhaps, its best to change `min(g.degree())` to `min(g.degree(),0)`?

The empty graph again :( 

We have to treat it separately, and graph theory books are not helpful here since this special case is most of the time omitted. 

According methods `is_connected`, it is connected, and according to `is_biconnected` it is not biconnected. So I propose to say return `True` when `k==1` and `False` else. Do you agree ?


Observe that we cannot use `min(g.degree(),0)` since:

```
sage: min([2,3,4],0)
[2, 3, 4]
```

I read up a bit on old sage discussions about it. 
I also like the exposition here:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/too+simple+to+be+simple

> According methods `is_connected`, it is connected, and according to `is_biconnected` it is not biconnected. So I propose to say return `True` when `k==1` and `False` else. Do you agree ?

I would prefer to have `is_connected` return `False`, but I guess nobody wants to discuss this again. For our case, I would agree with any convention that you decide.

What I meant was `min(g.degree() or [0])`. (And in Python 3.4 one could do `min(g.degree(), default=0)`!)

Sorry for bringing up this special case...
