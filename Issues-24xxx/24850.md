Simply call `_convert()` with the parent keyword.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The current implementation of numerical_approx has 

```
        x = x = x._convert(kwds)

        if is_a_numeric(x._gobj):
            res = py_object_from_numeric(x._gobj)
        elif  is_a_constant(x._gobj):
            res = x.pyobject()
        else:
            raise TypeError("cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically")
```
If `x` is a n number with units (example in ticket) then it would go to the else block, So can you suggest a check for expression which are numbers attached with units?

<a id='comment:3'></a>As suggested in the description of this ticket, and specifically stated in the [sage-support discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/3eCHzmJ1MXY) that is mentioned there, the `_convert()` method can deal with the example in this ticket:

```
sage: cm = units.length.centimeter;
sage: x = 1e-6*cm;
sage: x._convert({'parent':RealField(10)})
(1.0e-6)*centimeter
```
So this problem will be solved if #12577 is merged. And the case here (or something similar) could be added to the docstring as an example.

However, I don't think that would be a complete solution to the issue that is raised here, because attempting to evaluate `sin(x)*cm` numerically (when `x` is a variable) should give a `TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically`, but we have:

```
sage: var('x');
sage: (sin(x)*cm)._convert({'parent':RealField(10)})
1.0*centimeter*sin(x)
```
