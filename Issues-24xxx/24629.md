It depends on fixing pcre, see #24628.

There are linking errors involving the `baseRegisterIndex` variable, which boil down to the `int baseRegisterIndex` defined in `src/main/devices.c` and wrongly declared in  `src/include/GraphicsBase.h` as non-extern. Declaring it `extern` fixes the linking.

**Upstream**: https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17385

CC:  @jdemeyer

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

Reviewer: Dima Pasechnik

Author: Jeroen Demeyer

Branch: 97ac0ac61e926e78482d0006f5c3ca6ce4f486a4

Resolution: fixed

This is where it is stuck if using system's pcre rather than the broken Sage pcre:

perhaps building without `-g` might help?
