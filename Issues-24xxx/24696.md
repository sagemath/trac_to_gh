`hash_map` is not part of the C++ standard library. Some compilers like GCC implement it anyway. However clang does not have it, leading to compile failure with `CC=clang` on OpenSuSE Leap 42.3:

```

    class hash_map

```
Instead `unordered_map` should be used.

Jeroen, it works fine, I assume I can set positive?

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A8):
> I guess it wasn't seen because we haven't tested a clang that old for some time. Also I think your clang uses libstdc++ from gcc-4.8 while all we made a point of testing with clang's own libstdc++.

Right, they have no official clang libstdc++ package on OpenSuSE.
