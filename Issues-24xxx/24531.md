PARI/GP has integrated the ratpoints package (they essentially copied the code, cleaned it up a bit and made it interface with the rest of PARI). Therefore, we can replace ratpoints by the PARI functions `ellratpoints` and `hyperellratpoints`.

The ratpoints package and its interface are kept in Sage, but marked as deprecated and no longer used.

Depends on #24713

I have to, because `paridecl.pxd` is not up-to-date. So, with the current cypari2 version, this is the only way.

Anyway, I'm fine with continuing this discussion for cypari2. But I don't think that this ticket should be blocked by that.
