Here is a list of things that can be done to improve the layout (1-3, 4?) and flexibility (5-7) of the LaTeX output of `Poset.show`

1. Add optional scale for nodes.
2. Add optional `overlap=scale` to dot2tex progoptions.
3. Set minimum node size to be the maximal node size that appeared in the preprocessing step of dot2tex. (This might need changes in dot2tex itself.)
4. Improve plotting of ranked posets using [rank option](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:rank) of Graphviz. (Not sure if this is worth the effort. Also, see  #13236)
5. Add option for landscape plots.
6. Add color_by_label.
7. Allow noninjective vertex labels. See #15206 (This probably requires change to `Graph`.)
