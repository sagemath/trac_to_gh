Keywords: arblib, CBF, RBF, ComplexBallField, RealBallField

Many Sage functions could be computed using arb
but the interface is missing.

- #32851: `erfi`, upper inc. gamma (i.e. `gamma(a,b)`), `gamma_inc_lower`
- #32851: `beta` (initial work)
- `elliptic_pi`
- `elliptic_e` (incomplete of 2nd kind -- the interface `CBF(...).elliptic_e` actually corresponds to `elliptic_ec`
- `hurwitz_zeta` - implemented as 2-argument `zeta`, documented in #32851
- #32851: exponential, sine, cosine integrals
- #24823: L-function evaluation
- #28624: Riemann zeta function zeros

an initial wrapping of `beta(a,b)` added on #32851, with a caveat (see TODO).

Basically, `RBF(beta(a,b))` does not work, but `RBF(a).beta(b)` does.
