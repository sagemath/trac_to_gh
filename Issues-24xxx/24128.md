Create a class that takes a finite set and an automorphism (= permutation) as inputs, and computes the orbit sizes and verifies homomesy with respect to any given statistic. Something like that seems to have been envisioned in ticket #18062, but to our knowledge never implemented.

Eventually, we will also want it to check cyclic sieving with respect to any given polynomial.

I realize some of this is done in `src/sage/combinat/cyclic_sieving_phenomenon.py`. Of course, we'd want more: homomesy checking; finding the orbit of a single point rather than all the orbits.

What is the general opinion about this module? Should we just add to it, or should it be completely refactored?

Some work done. The class is functional for what we need -- homomesy checking for dynamical systems with invertible evolution --, but its doc is very bare-bones and it's lacking a lot of bells and whistles. Also, the three examples are "def"-functions rather than subclasses of their own; thus, their "repr" is crap.

I know I had mentioned `object` to you, but `SageObject` is actually the better thing to inherit from. Mea culpa. Then you can use `_repr_` (and `_latex_`, `_ascii_art_`, and `_unicode_art_`).

Note that if you do `self._X = tuple(X)`, then you force `X` to be finite.

I would also consider not putting the evolution function in the repr. Things like that can be more trouble than its worth IMO.

I noticed on a quick look: you have `FDDS` in the `DiscreteDynamicalSystem` doc.

This now has sufficient functionality for anything I personally want to do. Not sure if the class hierarchy is up to Sage standards, though:

```
- :class:`DiscreteDynamicalSystem`: general discrete dynamical
  system, as above.
  Inherit from this class if the ground set of your DDS is
  infinite or large enough that you want to avoid it getting
  stored as a list.

- :class:`FiniteDynamicalSystem`: finite discrete dynamical
  system.

- :class:`InvertibleDiscreteDynamicalSystem`: invertible
  discrete dynamical system.
  This implements an ``inverse_evolution`` method for `\phi^{-1}`
  (the default implementation simply applies `\phi` over and
  over until the original value is revisited; the last value
  before that is then taken to be the result).

- :class:`InvertibleFiniteDynamicalSystem`: invertible
  finite discrete dynamical system.
```

(This would perhaps be easier with the category framework, but I don't know it well enough.)

There are a few examples, all of which are implemented as staticmethods on a class `class discrete_dynamical_systems()`.

I would not have a class `discrete_dynamical_systems` with ``@`staticmethod`s. Instead, I would implement a catalog module and have functions there. You then import the catalog file in the global namespace as `discrete_dynamical_systems`. I would also make them faux-classes in terms of naming (i.e., using CamelCase).

Some things to note:

- You should use `_repr_` so you can override this with `rename` and you are inheriting from `SageObject`.
- I probably would not add the rule to the output because it will not be so useful.
- `.. TODO ::` -> `.. TODO::` and what follows should be indented.

This is now needs_review.

For now, the functionality is fairly shallow (the most complicated algorithm is finding all cycles of a finite DDS); the main use of the module is convenience and examples. There are lots of todos in the doc, some of which I may want to deal with one day.

The file is called `sage/combinat/finite_dynamical_system.py` because it is mainly meant for use by combinatorialists and because most of the functionality concerns finite DDSes, but I am open to renaming and/or moving it.

I think this should go in the `sage/dynamics` folder and then be listed in the `Discrete dynamics` header in the corresponding `index.rst` file.

I am not sure I agree with putting the important doc at the module level. This makes it really difficult for people using `?` to see it. Moreover, if the module level is really short, people will quickly find the class to see the doc when looking at it from the html.

You should put the `INPUT:` block in the class level doc because it will only get seen by people looking at the source code in the `__init__`. Same for the `EXAMPLES::`. A good test to do in `__init__` is a `TestSuite(Foo).run()`.

Why do you not automatically force `X` to be a tuple? Concerned if `X` is a parent object? Why not test `if isinstance(X, Parent):` and otherwise (if not also `None`) force `X` to be a tuple. I don't see the reason why it should be allowed to stay mutable.

This would be cleaner and faster if you pull out the `self.evolution()` and `self.inverse_evolution()` as variables:

```
            if self.evolution()(self.inverse_evolution()(y)) != y:
                return False
            if self.inverse_evolution()(self.evolution()(y)) != y:
```

If you change `inverse_evolution_default` to `_inverse`, then you only have to do

```diff
-        if inverse is None:
-            self._inverse = self.inverse_evolution_default
-        else:
+        if inverse is not None:
            self._inverse = inverse
```

Again, I think you should have a catalog (module) instead of a class with a bunch of ``@`staticmethod`s.

Only remaining questions:

- Should the evolution map be self.evolution() or self.evolution? Former looks more "right" to me, but I'm not sure why. Latter is easier to type.

- create_tuple=True as default? If so, when? Is there an "is_mutable" test that (quickly) returns True on lists and other mutable things but False on enumerated sets and such?

A few little things:

(Optional) `cyclic_sieving_phenomenon.py` -> `:mod:`sage.combinat.cyclic_sieving_phenomenon`` and similar such things to make the doc better linked.

For inputs:

```
- ``foo`` -- the type (default: bar); the detailed info
```

The `__init__` is missing doctests (a `TestSuite(foo).run()` is good here). (A few places.)

Extra space after the `x`:

```
sage: F = DiscreteDynamicalSystem(W, lambda x : x[1:] + Word([x[0]]), is_finite=True, inverse=True)
```
(Similar in a few a places.)

```diff
-        return "An invertible discrete dynamical system with ground set " \
-               + repr(self._X)
+        return "An invertible discrete dynamical system with ground set " repr(self._X)
```

```diff
-        for i in self._X:
-            if f(phi(i)) != f(i):
-                return False
-        return True
+        return all(f(phi(i)) == f(i) for i in self._X)
```

For lists split over multiple lines, it looks better with a space before it; e.g.,

```
+        [2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14,
+         14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14]
```

```diff
-nu = list(reversed(sorted(mu + [len(lam)])))
+nu = sorted(mu + [len(lam)], reverse=True)
```
