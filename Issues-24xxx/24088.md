Most relevant part of the install log (which is messed up due to parallel builds)

This can easily be reproduced by

```
./sage --pip uninstall ipython_genutils
./sage -f ipykernel
```

It is very curious as the log shows that `traitlets` is installed and used, and it should have pulled `ipython_genutils` in fact looking at it closer, one can see the failing call is from traitlets. The quoted github issue is most relevant here I think.
