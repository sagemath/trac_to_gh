It is very curious as the log shows that `traitlets` is installed and used, and it should have pulled `ipython_genutils` in fact looking at it closer, one can see the failing call is from traitlets. The quoted github issue is most relevant here I think.

I'm a bit confused by the status of this ticket. It was changed from new to needs review by the reviewer, so I do not know wether Jeroen thinks it is already ready for review. Anyway I am moving it to "needs work" so that other people can put it in the correct status.

Yes, that was confusing indeed.

But it needs review now.
