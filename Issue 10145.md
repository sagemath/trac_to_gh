See #329. It's for doing integrity checks of spkg files. The md5sum of the spkg should be a377b1b98b6e92164f4042783a949e75, if you want to be very cautious.

You could review #329 after you're done here. :)

The `sagecommandline` environment is the new thing, so please look carefully at that. Look at the examples, try to make up your own examples, check over the documentation, etc.

Looking over `hg log`, other changes include:

* generated files are now called .sagetex.sage, .sagetex.py, etc.
* the warning that you need to re-run Sage that LaTeX prints is hopefully a little more obvious
* there's a CONTRIBUTORS file.

The commandline environment is the big thing.

The sagecommandline environment is going over margins on the right (perhaps it has textwidth width, but gets shifted?). I think this is a quite serious issue for any LaTeX package, so I will switch it to "needs work." 

(Vertical line on the left and blue on the right on the attached screenshot are parts of window borders, the text above is within margins.)

The documentation says: "The SageTEX package defines a length \sagetexindent, which controls how much the Sage code is indented when typeset." But when I try to change it, it seems that it affects only position of line numbers, not the code indentation itself.

After reading listings documentation, I see that it is easy to turn off line numbers (or shift them off the margins), but it would be great if this was mentioned in the documentation of SageTEX - I think that users of Sage are much more likely to worry about it than about syntax highlighting and other stuff supported by listings.

OK, I'll try to make this the last comment (I wish I could edit the previous ones...)

My complains about \sagetexindent affecting line numbers seem to be wrong, I think it was due to some of the extra code I had. But perhaps it is worth mentioning in the documentation that it does not affect sagecommandline.

I managed to change the spacing in code blocks by adjusting `SageInput/Output` styles. However, as I understand, every line of Sage input/output is typeset in a separate listings environment. As a result, aboveskip, belowskip, and lineskip all affect the line spacing and allow making it whatever one wants, but I don't see a way to adjust before/after space for the whole sagecommandline environment. Is it possible? If yes, it would be nice to document it, if no, it would be nice to implement it.

As for line numbers on margins, I still don't like it, but it seems to be supposed to be like that, so I withdraw my request to change it (but still it would be nice to explain in SateTEX documentation, how to shift them or turn them off).

Overall, thanks for a great package and a new environment in this version!

Thanks for fixes! It was indeed illuminating to read that section in PGF manual. And after reading it, it seems to me that there should be no default scaling of the produced graphics to `0.75\textwidth`, users should control it via `figsize` option to matplotlib, since in this case specifying font sizes and line widths in points makes sense and works as expected. This behaviour is easy to achieve in the present version by adding empty [] after `\sageplot`, but I think it should be the default.

Better yet, it would be nice if it was possible to write

```
\sageplot[width=0.5\textwidth]{...}
```
and this resulted in automatic computation of the required figsize parameters (since `figsize=[\textwidth, 2]` does not work). I guess this is a bit tricky since `figsize` requires two parameters, but perhaps it would make sense to use the same width and height if only one was given.

Optimization suggestion for listings-styles: `basicstyle` propagates to all other ones, so setting it to `\ttfamily` makes everything typeset with it.

Some more issues:

As I understand, because of the reference shift LaTeX tries to substitute the output of sagecommandline into inline sage and that does not work since the latter is in the math mode. But then rerunning Sage does not help since the source code for Sage does not get updated without a successful LaTeX run. So pretty much the only option seems to delete all (or some) autogenerated files, which is a bit annoying.

* If I put `\sage{...}` inside, say, `\begin{gather} ... \end{gather}`, then I get warnings about multiple definition of sage-related labels. Looking at `*.sagetex.py` file I suppose that the issue is in lines

```
try:

try:

i.e. they are exactly the same.

"Just ignoring these warnings" is not a good option, because I see only the top warnings automatically in my editor and if that space is "occupied" I'll have to scroll manually to see if my new lines have introduced any warnings that I would like to fix.

Attachment [STE-new.pdf](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket10146/STE-new.pdf) by @novoselt created at 2011-03-27 07:15:48

OK, I have found fixes for the vertical space issues both before and after. In the sagetex.py file (I am not sure where the original is supposed to be, I was fixing the version in `sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages`).

Lines 77-78 should be

```
    self.souttmp.write('\\newlabel{@sageinline' + str(counter) + '}{{%\n' +
                 s.rstrip() + '}}\n')
```
I have removed four pairs of `{}` before the newline. It may be not the proper place/way to do it, but the main idea is that these braces should not appear on the last line of every command line listing in `*.sagetex.sout`. This seems to fix the issue with extra space appearing after sagecommandline, if the following text starts a new paragraph or a theorem.

Line 145 should be

```
      latex_string = r"\unskip\unskip\vspace{\sagecommandlineskip}" + "\n"
```
Two unskips eliminate the space before sagecommandline which was appearing if the preceding line was "full." One unskip does not work, what is the correct number of them I don't know, but I took the repetition idea from `amsthm.sty` which contains

```
\ifhmode\unskip\unskip\par\fi
```
on line 140.

It is possible that `\ignorespaces` should be used somehow in the end of blocks for even more robust behaviour.

Please include these fixes, for these spacing issues are really annoying and it is somewhat non-trivial to figure out a workaround ;-)

No, but if the user has hyperref loaded, any `\newlabel` must have the five `{}` pairs or the document can't be typeset.

> It wraps each line into its own `lstlisting` environment and in the very end of the whole block there are these extra braces. Perhaps `inline` function should be left as is, but a copy of it without braces can be created specifically for `sagecommandline`?


That's a good idea, but in that case the copy of `inline` would have the same problem: with hyperref loaded, the `\newlabel` will fail without the extra `{}`s.

Would it be possible to use different label names for different SageTeX environments? If they are not mixed, then there should be no issue with using the output in a wrong mode and the user will be able to generate new input file and run Sage on it without deleting  anything.

I'd really like to get the current version into 4.7.1. I looked over the changes since 2.3, and I see three nontrivial, user-visible things:

* use `foo.sagetex.sout`, etc, instead of `foo.sout`. This means that if you put Sage code into `important_paper.sage`, it won't get clobbered when you typeset `important_paper.tex`.
* handle (some) spaces in filenames.
* use separate labels for `inline` and `commandline` (as reported above).

The issues not addressed are the spacing issues that Andrey has noted. The stuff about syntax highlighting needs to be addressed, but I think that counts as bikeshedding here.

If we merge the current version of SageTeX, we have something that definitely works better than what's currently shipping. I will likely have time over the summer to work on that, and in any case, Andrey (and Volker, and many other SageTeXers) will be at Sage Days 31 and we can have a discussion there.

Here's my proposal: I make a spkg for the current version of SageTeX and we merge that with 4.7.1, and work on the other problems noted here over the summer. What do you think?
