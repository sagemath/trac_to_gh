CC:  jakobkroeker @malb

libSingular functions require a ring parameter set. But for some functions the ring parameter is redundant.

Martin Albrecht answers to this issue:

We could do this: 

- if no ring is given, we try to find one as we do currently. 
- if that fails because the inputs are not polynomials of any kind, we could use a dummy ring.

My own solution to this problem is to store the last used ring in libSingular function calls, instead of using a dummy ring. In a Singular function call, if a ring is not found from the arguments, then the ring parameter defaults to the last used ring. The initial "last used" ring is set to `PolynomialRing(QQ,2,'x,y')`.

Could you just change the initial assignment to `last_ring` to

```
last_ring=PolynomialRing(QQ,"dummy",1)
```
and *not* update `last_ring`? Perhaps rename the global variable to `dummy_ring` too.

There are some reasons why using a dedicated dummy ring might be nicer than reusing arbitrary objects for the purpose:
- by making global links to arbitrary objects, where the global link has a rather unpredictable lifetime, you're making garbage collection and detection of memory leaks harder.
- you're making a link to a globally unique object. In principle, you're allowed to do so, but this can have very subtle effects on the system, because it can change the minimal lifetime of all kinds of related objects. So for the sake of sanity in debugging elsewhere, it might be better to not do this.

A pro of your current approach is that you might avoid having to create a dummy ring, thus saving the slight memory penalty for it.

This seems better. I will do it.

I don't understand this very well, mainly because I don't have a good sense about the garbage collection and memory leaks problems.

>  - you're making a link to a globally unique object. In principle, you're allowed to do so, but this can have very subtle effects on the system, because it can change the minimal lifetime of all kinds of related objects.

I don't understand this...

This is not true since a dummy ring is created initially.

A pro of my approach, I think, is reusing the user's "current" ring, thus minimizing switching of the internal Singular (current) ring, which seems a good thing.

As I am not sure about the seriousness of the issues you raised, I will wait for Martin's opinion about this. If the two experts, Martin and you, concern about my approach, then I will adopt your suggestion.

If the first call that arrives does have a ring parameter (the usual circumstance) then doesn't that ring get used? You could just leave `last_ring` uninitialized and only give it your dummy value if the value is required before `last_ring = ring` is executed. But as I discussed, I think there are drawbacks reusing rings of interest to the user for this purpose.

Do we check that? In that case you might want to do some timing. Note that most calls will have a ring anyway, so you'll have to search hard for an example where it matters.

Yes, good plan (although I wouldn't call myself an expert on libSingular--I've just seen some truly horrible debugging of memory leaks around it)

As there is no further comment from Martin, I decided to follow suggestions by `nbruin`. So we use the fixed dummy ring instead of the last used ring. The dummy ring, univariate polynomial ring over `QQ`, is created on the first use.
