Keywords: days82, hyperelliptic curves, shioda invariants

Sorina Ionica, Elisa Lorenzo Garcia and I implemented the computation of Shioda invariants for a given hyperelliptic curve of genus 3.

Following the implementation of the constructors of genus 2 curves over various fields we have added the corresponding classes for genus 3 hyperelliptic curves.

> The suggestion to have `shioda_invariants` be a generic method of hyperelliptic curves means that `igusa_clebsch_invariants` should be one too. It is not, so again the authors have followed established practice. A decision of this kind would also cause the number of invariants of a generic hyperelliptic curve to grow as new invariants in higher genus are discovered. Creating new classes in these genera as they start to receive more mathematical attention makes more sense to me.
> 
> Another alternative is to have `shioda_invariants` be a global function, just like `igusa_clebsch_invariants`. But is it justifiable to do this for every new set of invariants? In my opinion, it is better to expand the number of classes in small genus than to burden either the general hyperelliptic curve class or the global namespace with lots of functions.

In the current branch `shioda_invariants` **is** first of all a function in `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/invariants.py`. Of course this function should not be part of the global namespace.

> Making methods and functions for a specific genus into general ones has been done before, not only for `igusa_clebsch_invariants` but also for `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants`. This is another globally exported function, which assumes the invariants in question to be the Igusa-Clebsch invariants. But not all hyperelliptic curves have genus 2, and even then the Igusa-Clebsch invariants are not everyone's first choice. The same applies to the function `Mestre_conic`, which also exists for more general hyperelliptic curves. I find this confusing. Perhaps these functions can later be generalized with some kind of keyword argument that gives the genus or the set of invariants in question, with appropriate defaults so as not to break reverse compatibility.

Indeed!

So leaving aside what happens with `igusa_clebsch_invariants` and `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and its generalization, this seems to be the suggestion for the new code for Shioda invariants:

* At the least we create a function `shioda_invariants` in invariants.py that can later be found and used via a suitable import statement.
* Optionally, we create a separate genus 3 class and make `shioda_invariants` into a method for that class. But part of your point is that this is not the way to go since then the number of classes used will tend to infinity with time.

Personally I agree in that if we can do with a generic class only then that is what should happen. There is probably no possibility to store the genus on construction and tab-complete only those methods that apply for that genus? That would be optimal, but perhaps it is perverse and/or impossible to have the instance define the available methods.

> The second would be the extension of `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and `Mestre_conic` to higher genus, perhaps as methods in a more general module called `reconstruction`, because these functions arguably clutter the global namespace. Alternatively, we could modify `HyperellipticCurve` to accept a keyword argument specifying the invariants.

I agree. In detail:

* I'm sorry for putting `Mestre_conic` in the global namespace, it fits much better in a module.

* Letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword is better than having a separate function. I created the separate function `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` in order to make it consistent with `EllipticCurve_from_j`, but since we may be getting more-and-more of these, I agree with letting go of the consistency.

* The name "`reconstruction`" might be a bit generic. However, there already is a module called `invariant_theory` where this may fit.

Related to this discussion:

What really happens when constructing a hyperelliptic curve of genus `g` (in characteristic different from 2) from the invariants is that a binary form of degree `2g+2` is reconstructed from its invariants. Reconstructing binary forms from invariants is useful also outside of hyperelliptic curves and also for odd degree. Degree 6 is currently in the `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` function. Degree 5 is #25508. Degree 8 is #22173.

I think it would be good to have all the (binary and ternary) form reconstructions in the same place, and as this reconstruction for odd degree is unrelated to hyperelliptic curves, it should not be implemented inside the hyperelliptic curve functions. It fits much better in/around `sage/rings/invariant_theory.py`. So I think the first step is to move the degree 6 code to the better location, and then implement the code for degree 5 and 8 there too. The code can then of course be wrapped by letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword.

I'm cc-ing the author of #25508 who may have already started working on such a move.

Thank you all for your feedback. I finally found the time to deal with this! In #27633 there is a proposal for the issue with the design of classes, and I have updated the branch of this one to follow that method.

I agree that a general `invariants` method would be good, but that should be a topic for another ticket.
