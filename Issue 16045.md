Getting more doctest failures; full report _later<sup>TM</sup>_...


---

Comment by malb created at 2014-05-06 19:59:36

These should go into a new ticket, though (?) Or is that something this patch broke?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-05-06 22:02:55

Resolution: fixed

See #16322 for those doctest failures.
