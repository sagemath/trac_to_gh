From this [sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-support/-Dzaion3VrA):

```
sage: numerical_integral(x*cos(x^3),0,.5)
(0.1247560409610376, 1.3850702913602309e-15)
sage: integrate(x*cos(x^3),(x,0,1/2)).n()
-0.0677842754623305
```

Given

```
sage: integrate(x*cos(x^3),x)
1/12*((-I*sqrt(3) - 1)*gamma(2/3, -I*x^3) + (I*sqrt(3) - 1)*gamma(2/3, I*x^3))*(x^3)^(1/3)/x
sage: integrate(x*cos(x^3),(x,0,1/2))
-1/3*gamma(2/3) + 1/6*gamma(2/3, -1/8*I) + 1/6*gamma(2/3, 1/8*I)
```

this is probably something where Maxima is returning too many imaginary things and something isn't cancelling right either there or in Sage proper?  We've had trouble with either side of this with incomplete gamma functions before.

Robert Dodier of Maxima suggests the following later in the thread.

```

(%i5) display2d:false;

(%o5) false
(%i6) integrate(x*cos(x^3),x);

(%o6) (gamma_incomplete(2/3,%i*x^3)+gamma_incomplete(2/3,-%i*x^3))/6
(%i7) domain:complex;

(%o7) complex
(%i8) integrate(x*cos(x^3),x);

(%o8) ((sqrt(3)*%i-1)*gamma_incomplete(2/3,%i*x^3)
       +(-sqrt(3)*%i-1)*gamma_incomplete(2/3,-%i*x^3))
       *(x^3)^(1/3)
       /(12*x)
```

But this doesn't resolve the original issue.

```

(%i1) display2d:false;

(%o1) false
(%i2) integrate(x*cos(x^3),x,0,1/2);

(%o2) gamma_incomplete(2/3,%i/8)/6+gamma_incomplete(2/3,-%i/8)/6-gamma(2/3)/3

That's the only real issue with maxima-5.27. Some messages are getting mangled e.g. when maxima asks us for more information, but they aren't substantial regressions.

The complex bit apparently comes from applying Pynac's `evalf()` to the following expression:

```
sage: e = integrate(x*cos(x^3),(x,0,1/2)); e
1/12*I*sqrt(3)*gamma(2/3, 1/8*I) - 1/12*I*sqrt(3)*gamma(2/3, -1/8*I) - 1/12*gamma(2/3, 1/8*I) - 1/12*gamma(2/3, -1/8*I) + 1/6*gamma(2/3)
sage: e.n(53)
0.124756040961038 + 2.77555756156289e-17*I
sage: e._convert({'parent': CC})  # called by .n()
0.124756040961038 + 2.77555756156289e-17*I
```

(This is on ARM; the imaginary part does not appear on x86_64.)

There are known precision problems in the incomplete Gamma function, so this may be related to #7099, although we only want the default 53 bits of precision here.

The imaginary part turns out to be "simply" the fact that floating-point addition is not associative, and for some reason the terms in the expression `e` from comment:17 are added in random order by `.n()`.

```

 0.124756040961038]
```

This gives 14 different outcomes depending on the summation order (some of the differences are hidden due to the number of digits printed).  I don't think this can be solved easily, so I propose we stick to the `# abs tol` fix.
