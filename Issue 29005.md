This is a follow up on #28616.

It turns out we missed the case `bit_repr_`.

In order to be consistent, we change this to `bit_rep_` (at the moment there are both versions in use).

Even though those 4 python functions in `conversions.pyx` are very unlikely to be used elsewhere, we add deprecation warnings according to the name those 4 functions had before #28616.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29242

The reason I missed it is simple: autoreplacement.

When changing back `def _repr_(self)` I mistakenly also changed `bit_rep_` to `_bit_repr_` again.
