# Issue 28966: character art: line wrapping for matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29203

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-02-15 12:58:01

This ticket adds breakpoints to the ASCII and unicode art representations of matrices, so that wide matrices are wrapped in a readable way:


```
sage: %display unicode_art 80
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: matrix.random(RDF, 3, 8)
⎛ -0.27440062056807446    0.5031965950979831 -0.001975438590219314

```


Previously, the output was completely scrambled if the matrix was wider than the window size:

```
⎛ -0.27440062056807446    0.5031965950979831 -0.001975438590219314   -0.94678022

There is one small caveat: In the case of lists of matrices that do not exceed the window width, it can happen that now the output is wrapped

```
sage: %display unicode_art 80
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: [matrix.random(RDF, 3, 2), matrix.random(RDF, 3, 3)]
⎡ ⎛ -0.27440062056807446    0.5031965950979831⎞  ⎛-0.033673314214051286

⎣ ⎝   0.5056889961514748  -0.05461130074681608⎠, ⎝   0.6026443545751128

   -0.9401270875197381  -0.35104242112828943⎞ ⎤
   0.19906256610645512    0.3242250183948632⎟ ⎥
   -0.9541798283979341   -0.8948790563276592⎠ ⎦
```

while previously the matrices were displayed in one piece:

```
⎡ ⎛ -0.27440062056807446    0.5031965950979831⎞
⎢ ⎜-0.001975438590219314   -0.9467802263760512⎟
⎣ ⎝   0.5056889961514748  -0.05461130074681608⎠,

 ⎛-0.033673314214051286   -0.9401270875197381  -0.35104242112828943⎞ ⎤
 ⎜   0.5084492941557279   0.19906256610645512    0.3242250183948632⎟ ⎥
 ⎝   0.6026443545751128   -0.9541798283979341   -0.8948790563276592⎠ ⎦
```

This is fixed by #29204, but – even without that ticket as a dependency – it would make sense to merge this ticket because the output of wide matrices is so vastly improved in all other cases.

Changing keywords from "" to "ascii_art, unicode_art".

What is the rationale for the globally defined `max_rows = 20` and `max_cols = 50` (that are used in `_ascii_art_`)?

In plain text mode, matrices larger than that do not show their entries by default, but print a summary instead:

```
sage: %display plain
sage: matrix.identity(20)
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

This behavior is copied by `ascii_art` and `unicode_art`.

```
sage: %display ascii_art
sage: matrix.identity(20)
20 x 20 dense matrix over Integer Ring
```


Being global variables, one can set different default values for these variables in `init.sage` to customize this behavior.

Note that the message `(use the '.str()' method to see the entries)` is not part of the repr, but is added by the display manager using `LargeMatrixHelpRepr`, which is not used in `ascii_art` display mode.

I see. However, I doubt that among developers 20% know about the `max_rows`/`max_cols` customization... Note that integer partitions introduced `Partitions.options.display` to deal with printing details.

Anyway, this is not the purpose of the ticket! I am running the doctests on my machine (since the patchbots seem to be on strike).
