`@`cremona, please have a look at the change in src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/height.py, which looks like it was a bug.

No! It was right and is now wrong.  We are computing the exponent of a group `(Z/2Z)^r` where r is the number of real places where there are two components, so the exponent is 1 unless there exists at least one real embedding with two components.  (Here the no. of components is 2 when the disc>0, else is 1).

Really ?? But what is the meaning of `v(self.E.discriminant()>0)` where v is a place of K (which is not QQ) ?? This will just replace `False` by 0 and `True` by 1, which is useless inside a test. But if we remove the wrapping by v, then this does no longer depend on the place, which is absurd.

Of course, I am not an expert. Please be patient with me.

Ah.  It should read   `v(self.discriminant()) > 0`   i.e. we should test the sign after embedding the base field into RR via v.

Sorry I misread at first.  You can have a positive review for heights.py but I don't have time to look at the rest just now.

Thanks for your time ! I was just asking for your opinion on this precise point.
