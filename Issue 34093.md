# Issue 34093: bug in LaurentPolynomial_univariate.quo_rem

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34330

Original creator: mantepse

Original creation time: 2022-08-10 10:16:35

We currently doctest


```
def quo_rem(self, right_r):
...
            sage: (t^-2 + 3 + t).quo_rem(t^-4 + t)
            (0, 1 + 3*t^2 + t^3)
```


I think we want 

```
sage: q, r = num.quo_rem(den)
sage: num == den * q + r
True
```

Should `other` be `right_r`? Other than that it looks good to me.

Please make an additional minor corrections to the docstring (in addition to comment:5):

* "Attempts to divide `self` by `right` and returns" should be "Attempt to divide `self` by `right_r` and return" or, more simply (and I think better), "Divide `self` by `right_r` and return".

Related ticket: #31257, which fixed a similar bug in the multivariate case. We briefly discussed the single-variable case there and I thought it was ok, but I was being stupid.

I made a few other small tweaks to the doctests to make it easier for me to read and added a slightly more non-trivial test.
