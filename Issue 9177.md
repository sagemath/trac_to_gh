Cddlib's ./configure script should support --with=gmp=<path>. This ticket is a followup to #8730, where a stopgap measure was implemented instead. This ticket will provide rewritten autotools sources (configure.ac and Makefile.am's) to achieve this.

Here is the updated spkg. It works for me on F12 x86_64 but would be great if somebody can test it on SPARC.

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/cddlib-094f.p7.spkg

There is now a script at patches/refresh_autogenerated.sh that should explain how to rerun autotools and update patches/autogenerated.

```

The package installs in 32-bit Solaris SPARC and on 64-bit OpenSolaris x64. However, the refresh_autogenerated.sh script has a GNUism:


```
pushd autogenerated
for i in `find -type f` ; do cp -a $BUILDDIR/$i $i ; done
popd
```


-a is not an POSIX option to 'cp' so will fail:


```
kirkby@t2:[~/sage-4.4.3/spkg/optional/cddlib-094f.p7/patches] $ cp -a src-Makefile.am x
cp: illegal option -- a
Usage: cp [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] f1 f2
       cp [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] f1 ... fn d1
       cp -r|-R [-H|-L|-P] [-f] [-i] [-p] [-@] d1 ... dn-1 dn

```


See:

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html

for a list of acceptable options for 'cp'. 

Also, other errors I managed to induce:


```
Copying autogenerated files from autogenerated
./refresh_autogenerated.sh: pushd: not found
find: illegal option -- t
find: [-H | -L] path-list predicate-list
./refresh_autogenerated.sh: popd: not found
```


See http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/find.html
for POSIX options to 'find'

pushd and popd are not supported in the /bin/sh on Solaris, though the usual 


```/usr/bin/env bash
```


will invoke bash, which will support such options. 

A couple of minor points. 
* It is usual to provide a diff between the files written and those in the source code, though I must admit I feel they are of very limited use, as I could create one if I wanted. 
* It would be wise to stick the minimum versions of autoconf/automake needed - there are macros for that. I noticed configure.ac has no such entry.

There is no patch file for the autotools sources since they are all in patches/ and not in the corresponding directory structure under src/. Patches would also not be very useful since the new autotools sources are essentially a complete rewrite.

Thank you. 
 
> There is no patch file for the autotools sources since they are all in patches/ and not in the corresponding directory structure under src/. Patches would also not be very useful since the new autotools sources are essentially a complete rewrite. 

Fair enough. 

The other point I made is that I believe you should use macros that stops people using an old version of autoconf or automake to rebuild the files, since I doubt you can be sure your code will work on old versions. See

http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Versioning

http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#API-Versioning

so I would put something like:


```
AC_PREREQ([x.y])
AC_INIT
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([a.b.c]) 
```


where x.y is the version of autoconf you use and a.b.c is your version of automake. Then nobody with older versions can remake the files. Unless you can be sure all your code will work with the very first releases of autoconf and automake, then I'd add that. 

It looks like there are issues on Cygwin, so perhaps while you are making the other  changes, you can add something to stop people remaking the files with old versions of autoconf or automake.

Sorry, I overlooked the fact you had commented on this. 

This looks good. I've tested it on Linux (64-bit build), OpenSolaris x64 (64-bit build ) and Solaris 10 SPARC (32-bit build). I exported "SAGE_CHECK=yes", so the test suite is run. 

There's an amazing difference in the speed to compile this on my old Sun Blade 1000 (2 minutes, 38 seconds) and my much newer Sun Ultra 27 (11.5 seconds)! Almost 14:1, though I guess the new machine did cost me more than 14x as much as the old one. 

 == On OpenSolaris 06/2009 (64-bit build) on a Sun Ultra 27 quad core Xeon. ==
