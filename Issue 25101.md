# Issue 25101: Allow tensor of module morphisms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: tensor

Since `tensor` is functorial, we should be able to construct a morphism by

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, 'abc')
sage: phi = C.module_morphism(diagonal=lambda x: 2, codomain=C)
sage: tensor([phi,phi])

    220         args = tuple(args) # a bit brute force; let's see if this becomes a bottleneck later

    222         assert(len(args) > 0)
    223         return getattr(args[0], self._functor_name)(*args[1:], **kwargs)

+1

Nicolas Borie had implemented it; his code should be available somewhere (Sage-Combinat queue? some other branch? hopf algebra package? I don't remember)

Nicolas?

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
