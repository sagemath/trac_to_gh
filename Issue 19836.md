So, whenever you fix a bug you also need to add doctests to show that the bug has been fixed.  In this case, try creating some extensions defined by non-monic polynomials and playing around with them.  Do they behave as you would want?

Your branch doesn't merge against develop.  I think the following will work, if executed from within the sage folder:

```
~/sage$ git fetch trac develop:develop
~/sage$ git pull develop
```

Thanks for the help! Should merge cleanly now.

Cool.  You should also add some tests showing that the resulting extensions have the right defining polynomial.
