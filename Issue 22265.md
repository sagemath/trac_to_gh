I made a few changes to your changes.

In "as per Heule's theis": should this be "thesis"? This occurs twice.

Thanks! A question relating to this:

Is it possible to strip out all docstrings from Sage src, and then strip out all LaTeX parts from that? Then we could just check what words occurs only once, as they are propably typos.
