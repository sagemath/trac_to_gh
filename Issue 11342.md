We need more tests in `gsl/probability_distribution.pyx`.

See for instance #9080 - there are lots of methods which have minimal tests, and lots of error messages not tested.  This should be fixed.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

It seems like at least some of this is implemented at #11572, though probably not all.  In particular, the TypeErrors raised are not tested.

I have added the mentioned ticket as a dependency so that work done is not duplicated.
