It looks interesting but I am not sure how you are supposed to use it. A small tutorial or example (from the command line) wouldn't come amiss. Also can this be used from the tarball without building sage first or not?

No sir, all clear, it is just a (not so early) morning disease. However it strikes me that a ticket description is not substitute for documentation. The only documentation available is

```
+        update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
+    
+        $ sage-package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```

which I assume needs to be run from a sage shell.


Other than that lgtm.

Yes I can do that I guess. I am in two minds. Do I think `sage --package` should be in the help. Yes I do, it's the right thing to do.

Does that give more work in `sage-on-gentoo`? Absolutely, one more thing I will have to chop.

Seriously, put it in the help.

  Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?

* config: Print the configuration
  
  $ sage --package config
  Configuration:
    * log = info
    * interactive = True

* list: Print a list of all available packages
  
  $ sage --package list | sort
  4ti2
  arb
  atlas
  autotools
  [...]
  zn_poly

* name: Find the package name given a tarball filename
  
  $ sage --package name pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz
  pari

* tarball: Find the tarball filename given a package name
  
  $ sage --package tarball pari
  pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz
