It looks interesting but I am not sure how you are supposed to use it. A small tutorial or example (from the command line) wouldn't come amiss. Also can this be used from the tarball without building sage first or not?

The ticket description has an example. What is unclear? You don't have to build Sage first, it'll use the system python.

No sir, all clear, it is just a (not so early) morning disease. However it strikes me that a ticket description is not substitute for documentation. The only documentation available is

```
+        update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
+    
+        $ sage-package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```

which I assume needs to be run from a sage shell.


Other than that lgtm.

You don't need to run from a sage shell, you can also call `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-package` directly. Do you want `sage --package` instead in the help?

Yes I can do that I guess. I am in two minds. Do I think `sage --package` should be in the help. Yes I do, it's the right thing to do.

Does that give more work in `sage-on-gentoo`? Absolutely, one more thing I will have to chop.

Seriously, put it in the help.

Done

```
$ ./sage -package
sage-package
--------

The package script is used to manage third-party tarballs.

Usage:

* apropos: Find up to 5 package names that are close to the given name
  
  $ sage --package apropos python
  Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?

* config: Print the configuration
  
  $ sage --package config
  Configuration:
    * log = info
    * interactive = True

* list: Print a list of all available packages
  
  $ sage --package list | sort
  4ti2
  arb
  atlas
  autotools
  [...]
  zn_poly

* name: Find the package name given a tarball filename
  
  $ sage --package name pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz
  pari

* tarball: Find the tarball filename given a package name
  
  $ sage --package tarball pari
  pari-2.8-1564-gdeac36e.tar.gz

* update: Update a package. This modifies the Sage sources. 
  
  $ sage --package update pari 2015 --url=http://localhost/pari/tarball.tgz
```

PS: presumably you just delete the build directory on gentoo? If you want a patch that hides all package management commandline options from sage if that directory is not there then that would be fine with me (though on a different ticket)

I'll think about it. For the record I don't delete, I just don't do anything with it and of course it is not shipped. So the way you added the help here should be fine. I was thinking of `sage --advanced` I must say.
