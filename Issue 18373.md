This is because the Weyl group element implements `has_descent`, which is the standard entry point, and the default implementations do the following call structure:

```
has_descent -> has_left_descent <-> has_right_descent
```
since I think most code calls `has_descent` and gives the shortest path function call path if someone only implements `has_left_descent`. So the solution would be to explicitly have `has_left_descent(i)` call `has_descent(i, side='left')`.

The suggestion is essentially a good one, but fails because `CoxeterGroups().example()` is in a category where this again will cause an infinite loop.  Changing `has_right_descent(i)` in the way suggested works.

I had added a test, so could I ask you to be more specific about what you would like?
