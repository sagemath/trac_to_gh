# Issue 22080: Crash with univariate polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22317

Introduced on #22152:

```sage
sage: Pol = ZZ['x']['y']['z']
....: d = Pol.gens_dict_recursive()
....: x, y, z = d['x'], d['y'], d['z']
....: v = QQ(0)
....: (x*z)(x=v)
```

In the special degree cases, there is an assumption that `pol` has the same degree as `self`. This example shows this may not be the case (in the above, it gets reduced to degree 0).

I've convinced myself that this is the best way forward rather than reverting `pol.get_unsafe(i)` to `pol[i]`. I also made a few other small tweaks while I was digging around.

Thanks for taking care of this!
It looks like you could simplify the code a little by defining `d` as `pol.degree()` (without the `min()`) and replacing the use of `d` at the beginning by a direct call to `self.degree()`.

I agree, that should save us a few CPU cycles.
