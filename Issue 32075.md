Keywords: elliptic curves, group structure, finite field

This patch improves the computation of a basis of the group of rational points for elliptic curves over finite fields.

The algorithm works as follows:
* Call `gens()` to obtain a generating set; this in turn calls into PARI which factors the group order and uses pairings to determine the group structure.
* Let `P` denote the point of larger order `n₁`; we will extend `P` to a basis `(P,Q')` where `Q'` has order `n₂ = #E/n₁`.
* Remove all unneeded prime factors from the order of `Q`, i.e., multiply by the part of `n₁` that's coprime to `n₂`.
* Find an appropriate multiple `[x]P` such that `Q' := Q-[x]P` has order `n₂`; this involves a (typically easy) discrete-logarithm computation.
* As desired, `(P,Q')` is then a basis of the group of rational points of E.

Benchmarks: I ran `.abelian_group()` on thousands of random elliptic curves over prime and extension fields with sizes between 8 and 160 bits using both Sage 9.3 and the new implementation, and the new algorithm was between 30% and 50% faster on average (for all sizes).

In addition, there are cases for which the new algorithm is *dramatically* faster. For example:

The only curves for which the new algorithm is *not* polynomial-time (after factoring the order) are curves whose group of rational points has `ℓ^∞`-torsion isomorphic to `ℤ/ℓ^r × ℤ/ℓ^s` where `r > s > 0` for some prime `ℓ`. In that case, the cost includes a factor `Θ(√ℓ)`. I don't think I know how to construct such curves for large `ℓ`.

I cannot attest to the validity of the algorithm, but it is implemented as defined as far as I can tell and it passes doctests.

Is this something that is guaranteed to happen or is it for controlling user input?

```
assert len(gens) <= 2
```


Also, it would be better to write this on two lines:

```diff
-S, T = n//nQ * P, n2 * Q
+S = n//nQ * P
+T = n2 * Q
```


In the doc, you should use `\ZZ` instead of `\mathbb Z` for uniformity.

Do you have a reference for this algorithm you could add to the doc?

This is guaranteed by the documentation and current implementation of `self.gens()`. Unless someone changes the meaning of `gens()` in a mathematically nonsensical way in the future, it will always hold. I suppose the `assert` is realistically useless, but it does make explicit an assumption of the following code.

> Do you have a reference for this algorithm you could add to the doc?

I pretty much made this one up while writing the code. Does anyone know a reference? This is a generic-group algorithm, so it's probably a special case of something in Sutherland's thesis (or elsewhere), but the specifics here are tailored to the output of `gens()`.

That was my understanding from looking at the previous code, but I figured I should double-check.

This is outside of my area of expertise. Could you add a bit about the algorithm in to the documentation? Also, is this random still? It looks quite deterministic.
