When Sage is built with Python 3, there is no need to build Python 2, so let's skip it.

With this branch and a Python 3 build, I get two new doctest failures:

Should these be marked `# py2`?

One [comment there](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27529#comment:25) was that if `python` is `python3`, then the tests would work. I just created a symlink `python -> python3` here, and the tests still fail. I think either marking the tests as `py2`, or removing them (#26457) would be good. Or would #25358 help?

This looks good to me. I would like to have more opinions from experts, in particular people packaging sage for various Linux distributions.

And this will have to wait for 9.0.beta1, I think.
