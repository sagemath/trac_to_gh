# Issue 18396: element richcmp broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18633

Something is seriously wrong.

```
# ../local/include/python2.7/object.h:#define Py_LT 0

sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(RR)
sage: R(-2.22562705941257)._richcmp_(R(0),0)
False
sage: (-2.22562705941257)._richcmp_(RR(0),0)
True
```

That cost me days of Pynac debugging (of all things)...

Looks simple enough. Patchbot is happy, and the hypothetical Pynac problem has dissolved. Thanks!
