Keywords: reflection groups,days 93.51

The function is_regular for elements of complex reflection groups has a bug.

For example, the following code gives:


```
sage: W=ReflectionGroup(["A",5])
sage: w=W.from_reduced_word([1,2,3,5])
sage: w.is_regular(4)
True
```


The element w above is (1234)(56), and is not regular. Its order isn't even a regular number.
