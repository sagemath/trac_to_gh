# Issue 25241: Fix bug in is_regular

Keywords: reflection groups,days 93.51

The function is_regular for elements of complex reflection groups has a bug.

For example, the following code gives:


```
sage: W=ReflectionGroup(["A",5])
sage: w=W.from_reduced_word([1,2,3,5])
sage: w.is_regular(4)
True
```


The element w above is (1234)(56), and is not regular. Its order isn't even a regular number.

The base change to the Universal cyclotomic field needs to happen every time including the crystallographic groups. The eigenvectors of elements in crystallographic groups are not always defined over Q.
