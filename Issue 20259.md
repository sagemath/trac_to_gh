This is incorrect docutils markup:

```
.. [2] E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```

because the `E.` is interpreted as list item.
it should be

```
.. [2] \E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```

(You must have done a regexp search that didn't look for citation keys including hyphens, spaces, or other characters. I don't think that spaces, as in `[Haiman ICM]`, are valid markup, actually. Hyphens, periods, and plus signs are all okay. See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#reference-names.)

One would think that some of the above would present a problem, but I have no build issues with the pdf-docs for #18497. Is it possible that one only has to be careful when the REFERENCE: paragraph has only *one* line?

I think the best long term solution is to adopt the proposed (and documented) change: put a backslash in front of the first initial of the first author. It may not always be necessary, but figuring out and documenting when it is or is not may be too complicated to be worth it.

Replying to [comment:5 strogdon]:
> Is it possible that one only has to be careful when the REFERENCE: paragraph has only *one* line?

[Yes](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#enumerated-lists)

But I agree that we should just add the backslash always, that's the simplest solution.

Something for a different ticket: we should be consistent between `C. F. Gauss` and `C.F. Gauss`.

These changes work with #18497.
