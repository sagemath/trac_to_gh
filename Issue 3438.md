# Issue 3438: [upstream] GAP is broken with non-trivial CC in env

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2008-06-16 18:38:06

Assignee: mabshoff

When building Gap with CC set to an absolute path, i.e. `CC=/usr/bin/gcc`, configure fails. This needs to be fixed in their m4 macros and/or reported upstream.

Cheers,

Michael
