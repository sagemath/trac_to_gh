looks good to me although I am only at tornado-4.0.1/backport-3.4.0.2 in Gentoo, but this seems to be one of these piece that are low effort to upgrade. 

Since there is mention of setuptools my Gentoo upgrade to cython-0.22 to triggered updating it to 9.1 as the minimum version required. Think we should bump it?

Our setuptools worked, though why not update it...

Yeah, no one jumped up and down about things being broken. It may be someone being overcautious or a requirement python3 side but I guess it won't hurt.

I am not quite ready for ipython 3.0 but what's missing for this ticket to be put in "need review"?

Yes indeed. I just checked the dependency tree and that should be it unless we want to add curl support or testing.
