looks good to me although I am only at tornado-4.0.1/backport-3.4.0.2 in Gentoo, but this seems to be one of these piece that are low effort to upgrade. 

Since there is mention of setuptools my Gentoo upgrade to cython-0.22 to triggered updating it to 9.1 as the minimum version required. Think we should bump it?
