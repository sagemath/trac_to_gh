Or, unless there are other notions of "degree" for Boolean functions. In that case, its better to name the method `algebraic_degree` to make it more explicit.

Apparently, there is a notion of "numerical degree" related to the numerical normal form of a Boolean function (see http://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~carlet/chap-fcts-Bool-corr.pdf) . In that case, you have a valid point to rename the method to `algebraic_degree`.
