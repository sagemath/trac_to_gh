This implements #22509 for any Python packages that are installed with `sdh_pip_install`.  Passing `--root=` to pip is essentially the same as using `DESTDIR` with `make install`.

This required a few additional changes to a small handful of packages for them to work with staged installation.

I know what it is because I wrote the original. The code which is in that `spkg-postinst` script used to be in `spkg-install` but it's no longer needed because of Jupyter improvements. At some point, you must have had a merge/rebase conflict with `spkg-install` and this left-over `spkg-postinst` script is fallout from that.

> You obviously didn't try to build Sage with the ticket

That's a bit flippant.  Of course I built Sage with this ticket.  It's been opened for 6 months and has had to be rebased many times.  Perhaps there was a small merge error along the way.  But that's not as if it was never tested...
