# Issue 24917: Deprecate imports of persistence functions from sage.structure.sage_object

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Followup to #25153 to import persistence-related functions from `sage.misc.persist` instead of `sage.structure.sage_object`, and to mark imports of those functions from `sage.structure.sage_object` as deprecated.

I had forgotten that I made a separate ticket for this, and incorporated this change in #25153.  Once #25153 is closed this can be too.
