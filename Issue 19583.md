Keywords: triangular module morphism, days85

Right now, a comparison by the underlying `__dict__` is done, which causes problems when trying to define a cached method on a morphism. We need to implement a better `__eq__` for each subclass with more controllable behavior. See the discussion on #19609.

See also #21894 which collects similarly broken implementations of `__eq__`.

Why is there no `__ne__` implementation? I do not really see where such an implementation should come from, i.e., it just checks inequality on generators I believe. In fact (without claiming that this has any mathematical content)

```
sage: f = X.module_morphism(on_basis=X.monomial, zero=X.monomial(0), category=Sets())
sage: 
sage: g = X.module_morphism(on_basis=X.monomial, zero=X.zero(), category=Sets())
sage: 
sage: f == g
False
sage: f != g
False
```
So, I guess we should override the `_richcmp_` implementation instead.

Finally, I removed one call to the superclass, since `self._on_basis == other._on_basis` causes an infinite recursion when `_on_basis` is a normal method since comparing it triggers comparison of the `im_self` attribute…

To be honest, I do not really understand what much if this code is about, so I might have broken something.

nthiery: Sure. As we discussed at some point, mathematical equality is probably not what we should aim for in the first place: `==` should detect whether two objects are indistinguishable (in a reasonable sense,) everything else does not play well with dictionaries, hashes, … in the long run.
Anyway, if we have `==` we should at least have a `!=`.
