Chris,

Are you still working on this? I see the patches on the combinat server but don't see a patch here on trac for the quasisymmetric Schur functions. If you'd like to provide a patch of what you have I am happy to review it, add to it, finish it, or whatever.

-Jeff

I uploaded a patch which implements composition tableaux and quasi symmetric Schur functions. The majority of the code is from the combinat patch Chris mentions in the ticket description, except I changed the class of CompositionTableau to more closely follow sage/combinat/tableau.py. I have also included a backtracker to help speed up iter methods.

I am working on doc strings and doing more tests of the patch, but thought it worthwhile to post the current state considering FPSAC starts next week in Pairs.

Uploaded a new patch. Fixed a few edge-case bugs. Doc strings are next. I'll leave as 'needs_work' until I can get those done.

The new patch fixes some bugs and adds lots of documentation. There is nothing else I intend to add, so comments are welcome.

A commit message is missing. ("[mq]: port_quasi_schur.patch" is an autogenerated one. You should set a commit message manually by typing `hg commit -m "trac #13505: blahblah` rather than just `hg commit`.

On line 347, shouldn't the first > sign be an >= sign?

Thanks for the suggestions. I added a commit message and fixed the line in the documentation you referenced.

Following a suggestion from Chris Berg, I also cleaned up the `all.py` files so as not to pollute the global namespace.

Hey Jeff,

I've uploaded a review patch which moves the composition tableaux into its own file and does some minor cleanup of the docstrings and removing whitespace. There is a trivial dependency on #14101 in the `combinat/all.py`. If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Travis,

I folded your review patch into the main patch. Thanks for your helpful edits. I had been wondering whether to pull the CompositionTableaux classes out and into a new module, thanks for taking care of that. It does make a lot more sense to have them separate.
