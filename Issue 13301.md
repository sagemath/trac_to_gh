Chris,

Are you still working on this? I see the patches on the combinat server but don't see a patch here on trac for the quasisymmetric Schur functions. If you'd like to provide a patch of what you have I am happy to review it, add to it, finish it, or whatever.

The majority of the code is from the combinat patch Chris mentions in the ticket description, except I changed the class of CompositionTableau to more closely follow sage/combinat/tableau.py.

I am working on doc strings and doing more tests of the patch, but thought it worthwhile to post the current state considering FPSAC starts next week in Pairs.

Hey Jeff,

I've uploaded a review patch which moves the composition tableaux into its own file and does some minor cleanup of the docstrings and removing whitespace. There is a trivial dependency on #14101 in the `combinat/all.py`. If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
