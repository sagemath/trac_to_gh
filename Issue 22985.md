CC:  cremona

Keywords: isogenies, supersingular

I'm not sure about what's happening here. While playing around with supersingular curves:


```
sage: K = GF(47^2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,K.gen()])
sage: E.trace_of_frobenius()
-47
sage: [E.isogeny(f).codomain().j_invariant() for f,_ in E.division_polynomial(7).factor()[3:]]
[0, 24*z2 + 1, 24*z2 + 1, 24*z2 + 1, 36, 36, 36]
sage: [E.isogeny(f).codomain().trace_of_frobenius() for f,_ in E.division_polynomial(7).factor()[3:]]
[-47, -49, -49, -49, 94, 94, 94]
```


The first curve is ok. The occurrences of trace 94 are weird, but j=0 and j=36 (1728) are 7-isogenous nevertheless. But trace -49?! That's not even supersingular!

What's even more weird is that Magma gives the same results, so I'm starting to doubt of my own sanity.

Remember that the Trace of Frobenius is an integer, not an element of the field, so seeing 94 which is 0 mod 47 is ok.
Secondly, you have omitted the isogeny whose kernel is the product of the 3 linear factors of the 7-division polynomial.
Thirdly, if you want to see the 7-isogenous curves it is better to do

```
E.isogenies_prime_degree(7)
```

since it is non-trivial to combine the factors of the division polynomial correctly.  In this case there are only two 7-isogenies.  Not that E.isogeny(f) does *not* actually check that f is a valid kernel polynomial even when check=True is give (the default).  It should!

I agree with that, but doesn't Sato-Tate say that two curves are isogenous over a finite field iff they have the **same** trace? As I said, j=0 and j=36 are isogenous over GF(47<sup>2</sup>), but the exact curves in the example are not. And, indeed:


```
sage: phi = E.isogeny(E.division_polynomial(7).factor()[8][0])
sage: phi(E.random_point())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Coordinates [16*z2 + 30, 3*z2 + 22, 1] do not define a point on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (3*z2+36)*x over Finite Field in z2 of size 47^2
```


> Secondly, you have omitted the isogeny whose kernel is the product of the 3 linear factors of the 7-division polynomial.

Yes. I just wanted to highlight the bug. One of the buggy factors would have been enough.

> Thirdly, if you want to see the 7-isogenous curves it is better to do
> {{{

> since it is non-trivial to combine the factors of the division polynomial correctly.

Absolutely. However, I found the bug while doing a more general search.

> Not that E.isogeny(f) does *not* actually check that f is a valid kernel polynomial even when check=True is give (the default).  It should!  When it was written we did not have code to do that but now we do.  It is slightly buried in the function isogenies_prime_degree_general().

Well, that's not completely correct:


```
sage: E.isogeny(E.base_field().polynomial_ring().random_element(3))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: The polynomial does not define a finite subgroup of the elliptic curve.
```


So there are some checks, but they are buggy, at least for j=0,1728, I suspect.

I do not have time to dig this further right now. Hopefully in a couple of weeks I can come up with a fix.

The j-invariant does not determine the trace since it only determines the curve up to twist; in your case there are more than 2 twists as well.

Yes, some checking is done for validity of kernel polys, but that is misleading since bad input passes those tests as they are not complete.

We'll come back to that.

I still don't get it. Admittedly, `E.isogeny(f)` does not test that `f` is a valid kernel polynomial. But, why is `f` not a valid kernel polynomial in this example:


```
sage: f = E.division_polynomial(7).factor()[4][0]
sage: E.is_supersingular()
True
sage: E.isogeny(f).codomain().is_supersingular()
False
```


Also, the `TypeError` in [comment:2 comment 2] is not nice and would deserve fixing.

The kernel poly of a 7-isogeny is a degree 3 factor of the 7-division poly but not every degree 3 factor is a kernel poly!  In this case the 3 roots of your degree 3 factor, which all lie in GF(47^6), are the x-coordinates of points in 3 different subgroups of order 7.

In the function isogenies_prime_degree_general() in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree, this is implemented properly: factor the l-division poly (here l is an odd prime); keep only factors of degree dividing (l-1)/2;  for each such factor work out whether or not it is an irreducible factor of a kernel poly.

It would be possible to extract from the code of that function a test for whether a polynomial of degree (l-1)/2 actually is a kernel poly.  Feel free to make a ticket for that!  The relevent theory is in Kimi Tsukazaki's thesis (cited in that file).

In `is_kernel_polynomial`, there is this test:


```
psi_m = E.division_polynomial(m)
if not f.divides(psi_m):
    return False
```


isn't it (much) more efficient to do


```
if E.division_polynomial(m, x=f.parent().quo(f).gen()) != 0:
    return False

The doc still says

        input is valid (e.g., that the kernel polynomial provided is
        valid); however, invalid input can in some cases still pass,

what are the invalid inputs that still pass?
