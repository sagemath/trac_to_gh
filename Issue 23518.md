Conflict with #23711.

Is `The abstract class provides default implementation of the following getter methods` grammatically correct or should it be `...provides a default...`

`provides a default`

checked! but there's a missing `s` here: `as it avoid` --> `as it avoids`. or use simply `to avoid`.

I prefer "as it avoids" over "to avoid" in this case.

good. I agree with this last commit.

In fact that particular change was part of a duplicate block of tests (the same lines, although without the typos, appear right before this). So I deleted the second block.

Positive review, given Frédéric's reply.
