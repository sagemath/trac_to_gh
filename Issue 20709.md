Keywords: giac

Update the spkg to upstream 1.2.2-67

The giac tarball built from spkg-src to put in upstream/ is there:

http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.2.2.67.tar.bz2

Switch to .bz2 as wished in #18826

add --disable-ao in spkg-install to avoid libao dependency.
remove the --disable-gmpxx in spkg-install. The built seems not broken anymore.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20946

I need to test more. Ex:

```

[giacpy-0.5.6] Expected:
[giacpy-0.5.6]     1/2/(2*sqrt(6))*(atan(2*tan(4*x/2)/sqrt(6))+pi*floor(4*x/2/pi+1/2))

Yes I can do a simple thing that will work in sage as it works on gentoo since we have .pc files for blas/lapack. Probably won't work for parisse.

Hum I am unwilling to touch the `spkg-src` while I don't completely understand it. I would regenerate `Makefile.in` and co and probably wreak havoc in the current setup. Better ship it as it is now. If we really want lapack support we'll work it out later. 

Actually the current configuration will work on OS X I think and it is ok not to disable it as the runtime involved comes with the OS.

What is the last bit of `spkg-inst` supposed to do?

```
# create the script_subdirectory for the pexpect giac interface by running a trivial instruction
sage -c "giac(1)"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error running the pexpect interface of giac"
    exit 1
fi
```

Where is the directory supposed to be created? I cannot see anything new when I run `./sage -p giac` with this branch. I was, possibly, expecting something in `local/share/sage/ext` but found nothing there.
Running `./sage -c "giac(1)"` manually afterwards didn't have an impact either.

Indeed It looks obsolete. may by since #17044. Moreover I think that it is the only dependency of SAGE_RUNTIMES cf #19672 comment 6 and jeroen answer. I am trying to remove both.
