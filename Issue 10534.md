Other than changing one sentence in the documentation, everything looks good.

This applies cleanly to 4.6.1.rc0.  I am currently running the test suit to make sure there aren't any problems with error messages (one of which was modified in this patch to say "exponents" rather than "powers").  I'll report back tomorrow.  Sebastian

Following Geoff's approval of the patch itself, I have now checked the reviewer patch, too.

Looks very good. All tests pass on 4.7.1.alpha1.
