```
sage: z = SR.var('z')
sage: CyclotomicField(2)['z'].fraction_field()(2*(4*z + 5)/((z + 1)*(z - 1)^4))
```

raises an error but shouldn't. This issue is also mentioned on #24539.

AFAICS it worked in earlier [SageMath](SageMath) versions, but probably due to #23664 (unchecked) it stopped working.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26150

Added a doctest:
|                                                                                                                                           |                                  |

```diff
+            sage: T.<t> = ZZ[]
+            sage: S.<s> = ZZ[]
+            sage: S.fraction_field()(s/(s+1), (t-1)/(t+2))

```

Note that there is a conversion between `S` and `T`, so this conversion should be used also in the fraction field, at least in the case nothing else (proper coercion) works.
