# Issue 23273: Fraction field of fixed modulus p-adic rings should have floating point type

Fraction field of fixed modulus p-adic rings should have floating point type.

Currently the `change()` method requires that the type be specified, in this case, but instances such as the check `R.fraction_field() is self` occurring in _coerce_map_from_(self, R) in padic_extension_generic.pyc.

```
sage: R.<u> = ZqFM(125, 500)
sage: R.fraction_field().coerce_map_from(R)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'coerce_map' referenced before assignment
```

By the way, I would be in favour of implementing a p-adic field with fixed modulus precision (in which each p-adic number is truncated at the same precision encapsulated in the parent). I think it makes perfectly sense. Do you have any objections?

So, the amount of information stored in an element is unbounded.  This seems problematic since computations can blow up.  Why do you want to have this precision type?

Indeed. But is it really an issue?
I noticed that similarly `QpCA` does not exist and that the fraction field of `ZpCA` is `QpCR` and I assume that this is for the same reason, isn't it?

> Why do you want to have this precision type?

I will maybe need it for implementing precision lattices for which I imagine an absolute cap (having a relative cap is certainly also interesting but does not solve the issue of unbounded elements in the framework of lattice precision since the precision may be spread out over several elements which have quite different valuations).

However, besides this, I think that `QpCA` and `QpFM` make sense perfectly and should be the integer ring of `ZpCA` and `ZpFM` respectively. I don't think that it is a good idea to switch automatically between absolute and relative precision, it should be the choice of the user.
For instance, for now, we have the following behaviour


```
    sage: R = ZpCA(5)
    sage: R.fraction_field().integer_ring()
    5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
    sage: R.fraction_field().integer_ring() is R
    False
```


which is, I think, a bit annoying.

Depend on #14825 to include fixes for sections that are internal to coercion system.  Tests pass.

As for the discussion about adding `QpFM` and `QpCA`, I don't have a strong objection, but it will be very difficult to implement with the current framework in Sage.  In particular, it would require two new templates, since the `CR_template` and `FP_template` don't have the correct precision behavior, while the `CA_template` and `FM_template` don't have the right data representation (they can't store elements with negative valuation).  I don't think this is going to happen anytime soon.

This does not fix the following problem:

```
sage: R=ZpFM(3)
sage: K=R.fraction_field()
sage: K.coerce_map_from(R).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
```
