Fraction field of fixed modulus p-adic rings should have floating point type.

Currently the `change()` method requires that the type be specified, in this case, but instances such as the check `R.fraction_field() is self` occurring in _coerce_map_from_(self, R) in padic_extension_generic.pyc.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23510

Indeed. But is it really an issue?
I noticed that similarly `QpCA` does not exist and that the fraction field of `ZpCA` is `QpCR` and I assume that this is for the same reason, isn't it?

> Why do you want to have this precision type?

I will maybe need it for implementing precision lattices for which I imagine an absolute cap (having a relative cap is certainly also interesting but does not solve the issue of unbounded elements in the framework of lattice precision since the precision may be spread out over several elements which have quite different valuations).

However, besides this, I think that `QpCA` and `QpFM` make sense perfectly and should be the integer ring of `ZpCA` and `ZpFM` respectively. I don't think that it is a good idea to switch automatically between absolute and relative precision, it should be the choice of the user.
For instance, for now, we have the following behaviour


```
    sage: R = ZpCA(5)
    sage: R.fraction_field().integer_ring()
    5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
    sage: R.fraction_field().integer_ring() is R
    False
```


which is, I think, a bit annoying.
