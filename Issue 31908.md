# Issue 31908: Finite dimensional twisted invariant module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32145

Original creator: tkarn

Original creation time: 2021-07-06 17:16:52

CC:  tscrim tkarn

Keywords: gsoc2021 invariant twisted isotypic representation

The twisted (or skew) invariant module is the isotypic component of a (finite-dimensional) reprensentation corresponding to an irreducible representation of a finite group. This ticket aims to implement the twisted invariant in `sage.modules.with_basis.invariant`

This is splitting the original ticket #31939 into two parts, one for the usual invariant (#31939 itself) and this one for the twisted invariant.

Here is with my reviewer changes. Note that I rebased this on the two dependencies and squashed the commits. So do not simply merge it and instead pull the branch fresh. If my changes are good, then positive review.
