Keywords: gsoc2021 invariant twisted isotypic representation

The twisted (or skew) invariant module is the isotypic component of a (finite-dimensional) reprensentation corresponding to an irreducible representation of a finite group. This ticket aims to implement the twisted invariant in `sage.modules.with_basis.invariant`
