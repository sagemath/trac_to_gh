Keywords: elliptic curves, databases

There are two optional spkgs containing small and full version of the Stein-Watkins database of elliptic curves, namely database_stein_watkins_mini.p0.spkg (the small version, approximately 20mb) and stein-watkins-ecdb.p0.spkg (the huge version, approximately 2.7gb).

Both should be converted to the new git format for spkgs, at the same time making their names more consistent and completing their SPKG.txt information.  The interface in sage/databases/stein-watkins.py will need to be tested.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15556

Done both.

The new package files have been uploaded to sagemath in /home/cremona:

```

```


Installing even the small one is not very quick, and the long one quite slow.  The optional doctests in sage/da\
tabases/stein_watkins.py will work with only the mini package; remember to add --optional=stein_watkins_databas\
e to the command line or you'll not be checking much!

I checked and those changes are not included, the data is from 2003.

ok, I will change it to what you suggested.  This will mean renamed upstream tarballs and so possibly also checksums.  And a second ticket to update both to include the 2007 fixes.
