This fixes a crash that occurs sometimes during import of `sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZ`, where `ntl_ZZ` is passed a random int between 0 and 2^64.  This sometimes caused an assertion error due to and unhandled overflow error that could occur by trying to stuff a `PyLong` into a machine  `signed long`.

I suspect there are probably other cases like this one that I can try to suss out, either as part of this ticket, or just one at a time as we find them...
