Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently, a `Module` (not to be confused with a `Module_old`) does not have a `category` parameter to overwrite the default category `Modules(base_ring)` with a more specific one. Such a parameter is necessary, e.g., for porting Hecke modules to use `Module` instead of `Module_old`.
