# Issue 14981: incorrect degree of ring class fields

The degree function returns incorrect answers for ring class fields over QQ(zeta_3) and QQ(i).

See also [The second part of this thread on sage-nt, the part with title "Computing ring class fields"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/FncDnGsdSVI).


```
E=EllipticCurve("19a"); 
s = E.heegner_point(-3,2).ring_class_field().galois_group().complex_conjugation() 
H=s.domain(); H.absolute_degree()
6
```

The output should be 2, since ZZ[sqrt(-3)] has trivial picard group.

The problem is that there is a bug in the degree function for these ring class fields. The fields themselves seem to be correct.

In the method degree_over_H of the RingClassField class in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py, the degree is calculated using the following formula:


```
        # Let K_c be the ring class field.  We have by class field theory that
        #           Gal(K_c / H) = (O_K/c*O_K)^* / (Z/cZ)^*.
```


However, one should also divide out by units in `O_K^*` other than {+/- 1}. This explains the factor 3 that the degree function is off for K=QQ(sqrt(-3)). This is also exactly the difference between equation (7.27) of Cox's book (Primes of the form ...) and exercise 7.30 of the same book.

I have tried to do what was suggested. Not able to say if this is correct mathematically.

If yes, then there remains to add a doctest checking that this has been corrected.

Looks good; just a small reviewer patch to also fix the formula in the comment.
