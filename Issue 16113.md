It probably happens when `autoconf` is run, because the path is hardcoded in the `Makefile`. I can reproduce it with a git-2.0.0 version outside of Sage. This looks like the relevant log, i.e., not a wrong setting, but the failure of an env var being set:

```
config.log:| # If user did not specify libexecdir, set the correct target:
config.log:| # Nor FHS nor openSUSE allow prefix/libexec. Let's default to prefix/lib.
config.log:|
config.log:| if test "$libexecdir" = '${exec_prefix}/libexec' ; then
config.log:|    libexecdir='${exec_prefix}/lib'
```

But since this is official behaviour, Sage should be aware of it.

```

I also did `grep -R libexec= local/var/tmp/sage/build/git-1.8.4.4/src` and found no instances where `libexec` would be set to `lib`:

Indeed, if I touch `spkg-install` then `make`, nothing gets rebuilt. Isn't that a bug? As to version bump, after 1.9.1 or so (we have 1.8.4.4 atm) output of git changes and messes up sagedev doctesting. So, get the newest stable 1.9.3 and include a sagedev doctest fix with this ticket?
