I think we'd like to have it done before then so that we can get the ReST version out before Sage Days 12.  I can ask craigcitro to go through and look at it.

Positive review for both patches (they're independent).

Of course there are issues, e.g. the ridiculous name for the "abvar/morphism" file resp. chapter. But the polishing can happen only after the ReST switch has been completed, and changes can be "made visible".

The most important thing is that all the original information is still in the files, and this I did check. Looking over the Sage modular module, my fingers itch --- so much work (doctests, better and faster code, etc.), so little time ...
