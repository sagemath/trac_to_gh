# Issue 27060: symbolic expression of matrix outputs error on numerical_approx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27297

Original creator: @JCGoran

Original creation time: 2019-02-15 16:43:26

The `matrix` class does not seem to be behaving correctly when defined as a callable symbolic expression, and throws an error if one wants to evaluate it numerically, as demonstrated below:


```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.6, Release Date: 2019-01-15'
sage: var('a'); test(a) = matrix([[a, a], [a, a]]); test(1)
a
[a a]
[a a]
sage: numerical_approx(test(1))

The method described in [this "Ask Sagemath" answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39606/how-to-create-a-matrix-valued-function/?answer=39611#post-id-39611) works, but it seems somewhat inelegant, native `numerical_approx` support would be preferable.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
