Wouldn't it have been sufficient (and much simpler) to replace `__cmp__` by `_cmp_`?

Unless I'm missing something, it seems that the `key` argument is required, so the `except AttributeError` branch should be removed.

And given that `key` is required, replace `key=None` by `key` in the method signature.
