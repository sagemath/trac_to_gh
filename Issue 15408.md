# Issue 15408: Raise coverage of schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py to 100%

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15645

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2014-01-07 23:04:59

Keywords: Monsky-Washnitzer, elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves

The code in schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py largely dates from a time (early 2007) before Sage documentation and doctesting standards had been codified. Previous tickets #7926 and #8305 raised this coverage to 85%; this ticket is to get coverage to 100%.

After #15646, this has been moved to hyperelliptic_curves. Doc is still needed.

Changing keywords from "Monsky-Washnitzer, elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves" to "Monsky-Washnitzer, elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves, sd87".

This has been lingering for far too long... I added doctests to raise the coverage to 100%, but it would also be worth a look from someone with a better grip on the formatting conventions for docstrings.
