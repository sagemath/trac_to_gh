Keywords: ascii_art, unicode_art


```
sage: L.<x,y> = LieAlgebra(QQ)
sage: ascii_art(x)
...
AttributeError: 'FreeLieAlgebra.Lyndon_with_category' object has no attribute '_ascii_art_term'
```


This could be fixed by implementing `_ascii_art_term` or by implementing an appropriate fallback for cases where `_ascii_art_term` is not defined. The latter would be desirable in any case.

The same applies to the unicode art representation.
