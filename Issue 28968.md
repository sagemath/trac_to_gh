# Issue 28968: character art fails for LieAlgebra elements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29205

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-02-15 13:11:07

CC:  tscrim vbraun

Keywords: ascii_art, unicode_art


```
sage: L.<x,y> = LieAlgebra(QQ)
sage: ascii_art(x)
...
AttributeError: 'FreeLieAlgebra.Lyndon_with_category' object has no attribute '_ascii_art_term'
```


This could be fixed by implementing `_ascii_art_term` or by implementing an appropriate fallback for cases where `_ascii_art_term` is not defined. The latter would be desirable in any case.

The same applies to the unicode art representation.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

I am doing a full overhaul of the acii and unicode art for Lie algebras.

Here is a branch that fixes up a bunch of issues with ascii/unicode art across the Lie algebra code and adds some improved displays.

I merged in the latest fixes from #30119 and added one more unicode art with fixing the generic Lie algebra element one with multiline unicode art (that is a more general problem for another day).

Not sure about this superscript comma.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-07-13 04:24:43

I am not sure either. That was the best thing I could find for that one. I don't know what else to use.

Perhaps t⁽²⏐⁻⁴⁾ instead of t⁽²˴⁻⁴⁾, but neither is ideal.

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-07-13 05:38:56

I think the current version looks closer to a comma and is more human readable without explanation. I agree neither is ideal.

I agree, I just noticed that the appearance of what I suggested is very much font-dependent and not suitable.

So is this a positive review then?

is the patchbot plugin about (non-ascii characters without encoding top-line) obsolete ?

Probably safer just to add them.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-15 00:49:30

Are you using `u'₀'` instead of `'₀'` to appease some style checker?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2020-07-15 01:42:29

Some leftover stuff from Python2 that is ignored by Python3.

Changing priority from minor to major.

Hi Volker, it would be nice to get this into 9.2.
