The presence of the solver `CPLEX` breaks plotting of knots and links: see [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ryq2Pmn_lRY/a3twFJNUDwAJ).

Would be better to investigate the issue...

Indeed, the polyhedron of constraints is empty!

Now the code works with any solver... Curiously, the number of primitive in the graphics depends on the solution of the first optimization. Which also implies that the pictures in the documentation will depend on the MILP solver ;-)

Changing component from documentation to algebraic topology.

Just want to confirm that I was able to build the documentation with CPLEX backend!

Thanks for the fix. It looks good to me (and a bit more elegant too). Testing it now.
