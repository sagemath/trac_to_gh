You need to be careful about where you put the imports:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/schemes/toric/morphism.py b/src/sage/schemes/toric/morphism.py
index 3f97185..0b91fd8 100644
--- a/src/sage/schemes/toric/morphism.py
+++ b/src/sage/schemes/toric/morphism.py
@@ -386,6 +386,10 @@ from sage.geometry.all import Cone, Fan
 
 from sage.schemes.generic.scheme import is_Scheme
 from sage.schemes.generic.morphism import (
+
+import six
+
+
     is_SchemeMorphism,
     SchemeMorphism, SchemeMorphism_point, SchemeMorphism_polynomial
 )
```

You're trying to do an import inside of an import.

The import in `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.py` should happen before using it.

Looks good.

The title seems odd, as there is no change in for example groups-folder.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
