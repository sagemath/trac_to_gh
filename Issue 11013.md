A base_field become base_ring... I is very funny this bug never make things going bad.


```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module import FreeModule_generic_field
sage: FreeModule_generic_field(QQ, 5, 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'base_ring' is not defined
```


And in the code:

```
class FreeModule_generic_field(FreeModule_generic_pid):
    ...
    def __init__(self, base_field, dimension, degree, sparse=False):
        ...
        FreeModule_generic_pid.__init__(self, base_ring, dimension, degree, sparse=sparse)
```


As the creation is done with a factory, This bug is invisible from the user. But, if you want to build your own FreeModule over a field with category and some other stuff, calling the __init__ of this class make me fall on the bug.

Yes, sorry for being unclear.

Otherwise, the bot will not give a green report. I was trying to help this ticket to reach the green report.

Thanks for the explanation; I have updated the affected patch. I've known about the patchbot for a while, but I can't find any documentation on it. I don't even know how it determines which patches to apply!

This looks all ready to go.  Passes long tests on 4.7.1.alpha4.  So positive review.

Quite amazing this didn't crop up sooner!

I think both patches need their commit string edited, I am going to put up corrected versions.
