You no longer need to import `parent` (this should probably have been a `cimport` anyhow). Oh, and I missed that last time (sorry), but why are you changing `RealField_class._element_constructor_()` instead of `RealNumber._new()` â€” which apparently contains the logic for most other cases?

Can you change the exception to

```
raise TypeError("f"unable to convert complex interval {self} to real number")
```

(just trying to be consistent and using the same wording as similar exception messages)

Also, I don't like the `"Try to"` in the docs. Maybe write `If the imaginary part is zero, ...`

Apart from that, this looks good to me.
