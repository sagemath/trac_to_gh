We can avoid these methods that mutate variable type by setting up the correct variable type in the first place.

You did

```diff
-        flow = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
+        if integer:
+            flow = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True, integer=True)
+        else:
+            flow = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
```

but why not simply

```diff
-        flow = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
+        flow = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True, integer=integer is True)
```
