Someone told me that there was a Lyndon word file in sage.combinat that was outside of sage.combinat.words. We moved it.

The old import location should be deprecated: [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation)

I think you misunderstand how deprecation works. There should be a deprecation in the file `src/sage/combinat/lyndon_word.py`.  Since you moved that, just create a new file with this name containing only the deprecation and a doctest. The doctest should show that

```
sage: from sage.combinat.lyndon_word import LyndonWord
```

still works.

I think I've done the deprecation in a proper way, though I'm not so sure... The developer's guide is not so clear about it for someone who never did it.

I started a new branch since I changed the version of sage I had on my computer in between. It's now based on 6.9beta5.

1. You cannot just put docstrings in arbitrary places. So in `src/sage/combinat/lyndon_word.py`, you should replace

```
"""
docstring
"""

code

"""
doctests
"""
```

by

```
"""
docstring

doctests
"""

code
```


2. The indentation of the docstring is wrong:

```
TESTS::

sage: ...
```

should become

```
TESTS::

    sage: ...
```


3. Instead of testing `import *`, I would prefer to see a more concrete import (say `LyndonWord`)

One more thing: you should also edit `src/doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst`

The file `src/sage/combinat/enumerated_sets.py` still has a reference to the old file:

```
Words
-----

- :class:`Words`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.subword`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.necklace`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.lyndon_word`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.dyck_word`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.debruijn_sequence`
- :ref:`sage.combinat.shuffle`
```

I changed it. It doesn't seem to appear anywhere else, at least not in sage-combinat.

There is a doctest failure (don't ask me exactly why):
