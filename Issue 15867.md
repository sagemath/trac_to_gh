```
common/themes/sage/search.html:    browse Sage's source code by calling "hg_sage.serve()" while running
en/faq/faq-contribute.rst:`Mercurial: The Definitive Guide <http://hgbook.red-bean.com>`_
en/faq/faq-usage.rst:Try doing ``hg_scripts.merge()``, followed by
en/faq/faq-usage.rst:``hg_scripts.commit()``. Run both of these commands from the Sage
en/faq/faq-usage.rst:``hg_scripts.pull()``.
en/reference/cmd/options.rst:- ``--hg [...]`` -- run Sage's Mercurial with the given arguments
en/reference/cmd/startup.rst:  so executing ``hg`` for example will run the Mercurial inside Sage.

There's a line in src/doc/en/faq/faq-contribute.rst that could stand to be wrapped, but certainly not a blocker for getting this ticket in.
