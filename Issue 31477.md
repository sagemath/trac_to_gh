CC:  slelievre

The command `solve([1], x)` leads to the following error message:


```
TypeError: The first argument to solve() should be asymbolic expression or a list of symbolic expressions, cannot handle <type 'list'>
```


Here, a space is missing in "a symbolic".

(Moreover, I think that the last part of the error message is a bit misleading, because `cannot handle <type 'list'>` is in general not true.)

Maybe shorten the message to

```
            raise TypeError("the first argument to solve() "
                            "should be a symbolic expression "
                            "or a list of symbolic expressions")
