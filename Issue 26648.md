# Issue 26648: Radical basis assume that product_on_basis is implemented

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26885

Original creator: hivert

Original creation time: 2018-12-12 16:46:47

CC:  nthiery saliola tscrim

Keywords: radical, finite dimensional algebra, matrices

Currently

```
sage: A = MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 3)
....: A.radical_basis()
...
TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

This is due to 

```
sage: A.product_on_basis
NotImplemented
```


Either we assume (and tests generically) that each `FiniteDimensionalAlgebraWithBasis` actually implement `product_on_basis` or we construct one when we need.

ok. But would you please fix the pyflakes warning in the modified file (see the "pyflakes" patchbot plugin) ?

Replying to [comment:2 chapoton]:

I consider my fix as a temporary one. Not at all something which need a review. We first need to decide on the (not so explicit) question in the ticket description namely:

1 - should we provide a default implementation of `product_on_basis` and test is generically.

2 - or is it ok to construct one as im doing here when it's needed.

I'm clearly for one, but I implemented 2 since it was a simpler fix for my computation.

I might also say 1 as well.
