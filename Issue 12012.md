# Issue 12012: Change example in doc/bordeaux/elliptic_curves.rst

In William Stein's Bordeaux lectures he gave an example of an elliptic curve *not in the tables* (of conductor 154907).  But as of version 4.8 that curve is in the tables in the optional larger database, and so that example causes a doctest failure in sage/doc/en/bordeaux/elliptic_curves.rst.

The patch changes the example to one whose conductor is larger.

Apply to 4.8 (e.g. 4.8.alpha4)

This is a near-duplicate of #12617, so we should close this ticket in favor of that one.
