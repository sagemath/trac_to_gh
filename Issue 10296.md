Keywords: scheme projective morphism

Construction of morphisms between projective varieties which are no projective space itself fails, since the test that the defining polynomials are homogeneous and of the same degree cannot test `QuotientRingElement`s as these do not have `is_homogeneous()` or `degree()` methods.

Example:

```
sage: P2.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: f = x^3+y^3+60*z^3
sage: g = y^2*z-( x^3 - 6400*z^3/3)
sage: C = Curve(f)
sage: E = Curve(g)
sage: xbar,ybar,zbar=C.coordinate_ring().gens()
sage: H = C.Hom(E)
sage: H([zbar,xbar-ybar,-(xbar+ybar)/80])
