# Issue 15176: In the notebook, a variable named sys is overriden at each evaluation by the sys module:

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15413

In the notebook:


```
    sage: sys = 1

    sage: sys
    <module 'sys' (built-in)>
```



Discovered by Alexandre Charlin, while he was playing with an example of the book «Calcul Mathématique avec Sage» involving a system of equation that was stored under the name `sys` (see also sage.combinat.tutorial).

The same seems to happen with `op`.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
