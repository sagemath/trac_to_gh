#21783 removes the last productive bit of `sage-location`.

We get rid of the whole mechanism completely.

When we get rid of `sage-location`, we can finally close tickets #15146, #17479, #11755)

This is preparation of sorts for #31076, which proposes to add a different relocation mechanism.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31270
