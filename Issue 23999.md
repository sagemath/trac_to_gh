In many cases it is not necessary to prove equality of expressions but just check structural identity. An undocumented trick for doing this is `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()`. This ticket implements a well visible member function for this task.

Thanks for implementing this!


A quick question: is this strictly equivalent to `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()`? I mean, can we have expressions `ex1` and `ex2` for which `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()` and `ex1.is_trivially_equal(ex2)` do not give the same result?

One case is:

```
sage: inf = SR(oo)
sage: inf-inf
...
RuntimeError: indeterminate expression: infinity - infinity encountered.
sage: inf.is_trivially_equal(inf)
True
```

When I tried to construct another I found a segfault:

```
sage: half = SR(QQbar(1/2))
sage: (half-1/2).is_trivial_zero()
True
sage: half.is_trivially_equal(1/2)
BOOM
```

which is fixed in the next commit. Nice question! It turns out this gives True as well.

So to answer your question, no, except for objects that can't be subtracted the result is the same, and for those objects the answer is now correct.

LGTM. Thanks!

One last question: `ex1.is_trivially_equal(ex2)` is always faster than `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()`, isn't it?

Yes, it's a tree walk in C++ that returns as soon as a difference in the tree is seen.
