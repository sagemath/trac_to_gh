- 3. l289 to 296 change:\\


```

                     unsigned short ** d,
                     index_t *         current,         # choice of vertex for the current position

                      range_t * range_array_tmp):  # tmp space
```


- 4. At least two spaces before inline comment : 
l299 `cdef int pi # the position`
l300 `cdef int vi # the vertex`

- 5. Missing whitespace around operator:
l354 and l355 `ith_range_array[i+1]`

**Python question**


```
-            if i == 0:
+            if not i:
```

What is the reason for using `not i` rather than `i == 0` ? \\

`not i` mean `i == 0 or i is None` is it ok to do the same thing in both case ?\\
For what i see `i is None` should never happen but if it do i don't think it should pass silently.

Here we have `cdef int i` so it does not matter at all whether you write `i == 0` or `not i`. It's just a matter of style.

The advantage of `i == 0` is that it makes it clear that you're really testing for 0.

As much as I like to stick to pep8, and have sometimes made changes like this myself, between the two I genuinely find the original formatting more readable, in this particular case.  Nevertheless, it's not that important either way.

I agree with you for the readability. \\
But i also assume that readability is something highly subjective.\\

Either way the meaning of my pep8 remarks were "If the goal of the ticket is to be as close as possible to pep8 you should do this" rather than "This is a problem blocking the ticket".

I also find the first presentation easier to read, but I will not fight for it. At least we have globally improved the presentation of this file.
