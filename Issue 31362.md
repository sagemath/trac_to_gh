# Issue 31362: Pynac sometimes does not handle x^0 correctly when combining terms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31599

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Original creation time: 2021-04-03 05:45:29

Keywords: pynac

Pynac's `expairseq::combine_same_terms_sorted_seq` method correctly deletes factors of `x^0`, but neglects to record the fact that the expression has been modified. This means that pointers are not properly updated, so wrong results can be returned.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
