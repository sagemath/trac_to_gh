If on startup of Sage we set the LESS environment variable as follows (only setting it if it isn't already set), then the prompt at the end of docstring will be "(END - press q to quit) " instead of the cryptic "(END)":

```
   export LESS="-P?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m) ..?e(END - press q to quit) ?x- Next\: %x..%t"
```

> ... (only setting it if it isn't already set), ...

That may be too simple. For example, my LESS variable *is* set:

```
> echo $LESS
-M -I -R
```

However, that setting does not define the prompt (options starting with `-P`, if I understand correctly).

So, if the LESS variable is set, then one should still test which of the different `-P` options (`-Ps`, `-Pm`, `-PM`, etc) is defined, and only change the others.

+1 -- I would be happy to get rid of that.

In class yesterday some students strongly suggested that having a big mention of a useful help command would be well worth doing.   The first thing help() mentions is the tutorial command, so we would not need to explicitly mention tutorial. 

While we're on the topic, another student complaint is that the notebook server doesn't tell the user to type control-c to exit it, which is very confusing and dangerous. 

By the way, the tutorial() command has no doctest:

```
    def tutorial(self):
        """
        The Sage tutorial.  To get started with Sage, start here.
        """
        self._open("tutorial")
```

I think it could be tested by at least making sure that this isn't going to happen (which is what I got on my laptop, since I was building sage-5.0 on 10.7 and the html docs I guess didn't build, since I had to restart things):

```
...
OSError: The document 'tutorial' does not exist.  Please build it.
```
