CC:  @jdemeyer

It is generally preferred that the returned result type matches the argument type when calling a builtin function. For example this is as expected:

```
sage: factorial(8).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: factorial(SR(8)).parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: exp(0).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: exp(SR(0)).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

but this is not:

```
sage: lambert_w(SR(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
```


This ticket serves as a catch-all for such unexpected types.

Hello,

First of all, I think that the content of the branch is ok (I am running the test right now).

But I found the following behavior weird

```
sage: exp(0).parent()
Integer ring
```

In my opinion, a function should have a well defined domain and range. In some cases, the function preserves some subset. Like the function `x -> x^2` defined in the complex numbers preserves integers, rationals and algebraic. But considering that `{0}` is a subset of the real numbers on which `exp` preserve the integers is going too far.

Vincent

I tend to agree, but the present ticket is a step in the right direction in any case: it fixes some of the issues without making it harder to improve things later on.
