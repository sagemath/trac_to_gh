If the `gap_packages` optional package is installed, there is some code enabled in `sage.coding.linear_code` which uses the Guava package.  However, some of the tests that use it fail on Cygwin with:

```


The "exit status -11" indicates a segmentation fault in the `wtdist` program, whatever that is.

Since `gap_packages` is an optional package not installed by default I don't think this is urgent, but it would be good to find out what's going on.

Originally reported in #26930.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
