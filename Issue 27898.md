There are 3 failing doctests: to fix 2 of them, you need to add as first line of the modified file

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```


You should also fill the author field (in the trac page here) with your full name.

There is still one test that is failing. To test your file, type
`sage -t src/sage/combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py`

I am not able to reproduce the failing test on my setup.
(sage is build against python3)

The failure is

```
Failed example:
    pp.get_options()
Expected:
    Current options for ParallelogramPolyominoes_size
      - display:            'list'
      - drawing_components: {'bounce_0': False,
     'bounce_1': False,
     'bounce_values': False,
     'diagram': True,
     'tree': False}
      - latex:              'drawing'
      - tikz_options:       {'color_bounce_0': 'red',
     'color_bounce_1': 'blue',
     'color_line': 'black',
     'color_point': 'black',
     'line_size': 1,
     'mirror': None,
     'point_size': 3.5,
     'rotation': 0,
     'scale': 1,
     'translation': [0, 0]}
Got:
    Current options for ParallelogramPolyominoes_size
      - display:            u'list'
      - drawing_components: {'bounce_0': False,
     'bounce_1': False,
     'bounce_values': False,
     'diagram': True,
     'tree': False}
      - latex:              u'drawing'
      - tikz_options:       {'color_bounce_0': u'red',
     'color_bounce_1': u'blue',
     'color_line': u'black',
     'color_point': u'black',
     'line_size': 1,
     'mirror': None,
     'point_size': 3.5,
     'rotation': 0,
     'scale': 1,
     'translation': [0, 0]}
```

Note the u before 'drawing' and next line.

The fix is probably to replace the doctest result by what the bot gets. Note that there were u in what you removed.
