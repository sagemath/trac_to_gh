1.  Denis Simon's GP scripts (in data/extcode/pari/simon) need updating.

2.  Using them via gp2c would be more efficient.

The scripts have been combined into one and revised to make the gp2c-compliant, and gp2c has been used to make a single C file from them.  This can be compiled (once, on building Sage) into a shared library file which can then be used in a GP session, the result being faster running of all the functions.

To implement this we (1) created a new spkg containing the C file, which on bring installed puts tha .so into data/extcode/pari/simon (together with a helper GP script);  (2) patched the extcode repository (removing the old scripts);  (3) patched the sage library repository, mainly to adapt the interface in elliptic_curves/gp_simon.py but also to correct the doctest output (due to the script upgrade giving different generators in some cases).

So there are two patches and an spkg needed!  I have them all and will attach them shortly.

This is the ticket I mentioned in my recent posting to the other ticket #9322.

I think I was waiting for Jeroen Demeyer who 5 months ago said he would look at it after 4.7 was released, but clearly had other things to do (as have I).  I'll add it to my list of things to do.

One issue I do remember is that to make Simon's scripts work here we did a lot of editing of them (to make them correctly compile with gp2c), and told Simon what we had done, then as a result he made a new version which was already gp2c-compatible.  So then someone (probably me) has to compare the versions so as to merge our changes, in effect.  For example, one set of changes I made was to have all the top-level functions take as parameters all the parameters which Simon currently sets using global gp variables;  this made his functions a lot cleaner to use.

This branch updates Denis Simon's GP scripts to versions 06/04/2011 (`ell.gp`) resp. 13/01/2014 (`ellQ.gp`, `ellcommon.gp` [new], `qfsolve.gp`, `resultant3.gp`).  The scripts themselves were copied unchanged from Simon's website (`http://www.math.unicaen.fr/~simon/`).

Summary of the other changes:
- change `Qfsolve` and `Qfparam` to `qfsolve` and `qfparam`
- remove one doctest in `gp_simon.py` that is also in `ell_rational_field.py`
- remove `# random output` in `ell_number_field.py`; if necessary we can add `set_random_seed(0)` before that, but I got the same output every time
- doctest fixes due to changed test output
- minor documentation fixes

Of course the real work in this ticket was done (indirectly) by Denis Simon, and I just made the necessary fixes to the Sage library, but it seems to me that the "Author" field is normally used for ticket authors rather than authors of any "upstream" code; do correct me if I'm wrong.

Jeroen has opened #15809 for the `gp2c` conversion; hopefully John and Martin's hard work can somehow be transplanted there!

Replying to [comment:39 jdemeyer]:

Because #15483 is the obvious fix for the problem from comment:36.
> Now both these tickets depend on eachother. I would prefer to fix #11005 first (using `# 32-bit`/`# 64-bit`) and then do #15483 on top of this.
I thought Git was supposed to make things like this easy.  I knew that I made the two tickets depend on each other, of course, and agree that circular dependencies are *in abstracto* not very nice.  However, in this case, what looks like a circular dependency is just a way of saying that the tickets should be merged together; the structure of the Git branches is still linear and easy to understand.  Moreover, Git will automatically give the same result independently of the ordering in which the two branches are merged.  I don't feel like spending any time on making each of the two tickets pass doctests separately.

I also realise you don't like the patch at #15483, so I will make a bit more propaganda for it.
