I wanted to use couchdb, but it was a real pain to find a way:

http://wiki.sagemath.org/couchdb

We should find a way that it will compile with ssl-support. A lot of other python eggs need this too.

I haven't had any problems on Ubuntu (10.04.3 LTS) importing `ssl` (or `_ssl`).

I.e., after installing the (Debian) package `libssl-dev` (which includes the necessary header files, in contrast to `libssl`), then reinstalling our current Python 2.6.4.p11 spkg (with `sage -f ...`, to **f**orce reinstallation), all worked fine.

(Haven't tried to install couchdb into Sage's Python though.)

I agree that the documentation on how to [`easy_`]install Python packages for use with Sage could certainly be better.

Sorry here my answer again better to read:

 For me that doesn't worked. The problem was. that couchdb uses a  special module called: HTTPSConnection which is juat there if SSL was  directly compiled into the python-kernel. Installing OpenSSL or other  SSL-packages doesn't helped me at all.

And: Yes there should be  wiki- or docu-page to easy_install! 
It was a real pain for me to get it running.

Hmmm, I still cannot reproduce what exactly failed for you.

After reinstalling our **unmodified** Python spkg, with the `libssl-dev` Debian package installed in advance, the following all works for me:

```sh
$ ./sage --sh -c "easy_install http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/C/CouchDB/CouchDB-0.8-py2.6.egg#md5=b47f8fe5f0c76d7c45bf8e4805d43de4"

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

Finished processing dependencies for CouchDB==0.8
Exited Sage subshell.
```


Then, from Sage:

```
sage: import ssl
sage: import _ssl
sage: import couchdb
sage: from httplib import HTTPSConnection
sage: 
```


So does something else fail in a later stage when using `couchdb`?

(If so, we could include any necessary changes into our standard Python spkg, such that nobody would have to manually make changes to it, unless the build would fail in case e.g. `libssl-dev`, or other prerequisites, weren't available. It should be possible to circumvent the latter though, probably by additional changes.)

Sorry for that.

Feel free to also contribute to e.g. the [Sage Installation Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/) or the [FAQ](http://sagemath.org/doc/faq/); any improvements are always welcome.

I see. I just imported couchdb without the ssl and _ssl packages. But now it's working for me anyway. I will give the link to this trac in the wiki as well. Your way is easier and my is more python-couchdb-native, everybody should decide for his/her-self.

I think there was just some weirdness on your system which eventually happened to go away.
