# Issue 10687: Unify certain solve outputs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: solve, maxima, Maxima

In [this](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/365/solve-confusion) ask.sagemath question, there is some inconsistency in our use of Maxima's solve, or possibly its solving.

```
s=list(var('s_%d' % i) for i in range(3));
var('x y z');
print solve([],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z,y==y],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z,y==y,x==x],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([s_0==0],s_0,s_1,s_2);
print solve([s_0==0,s_1==s_1],s_0,s_1,s_2)}}}

Most of these do make sense, but you'll notice the change from complex to real variables, one place that seems to have a multiplicity, and the one with only a dictionary as output!

AFAIK, the issue with only a dictionary output was fixed in #8553. Multiplicity seems to be (one of) the problem(s) in #5679. Perhaps we should make this ticket only about the real & complex variables.

There are so many tickets about `solve()`. It would be good to make a trac wiki page to list all of them. This should help avoid duplicates.

This is [here](symbolics).

Okay, it turns out that there are a few problems here.
 * When one solves a single `Expression`, all args are passed to `Expression.solve()` which means `s_1` goes to `multiplicities`, and so we are getting multiplicities with the trailing `[]` and `[1]`.  
 * If one does this with three variables, then `solution_dict` is also `True` and we get the dict.
 * Then there is the complex/real issue, which I haven't delved into.

We should fix this all so that the solutions make sense and are consistent.

The documentation for "solve" in symbolic/relation.py says that the arguments are

```
    -  ``f`` - equation or system of equations (given by a
       list or tuple)
    
    -  ``*args`` - variables to solve for.
    
    -  ``solution_dict``
```

The function is defined as `def solve(f, *args, **kwds):`.  So I think we can assume that `args` is the list of variables, whereas any keywords are in `kwds`.  So 

 - we should document some more possible keywords, like `multiplicities`, or at least give pointers to documentation to any other solve routines which get called by this one, and

 - if args has length greater than one, then we obviously shouldn't just call `Expression.solve()`, but deal with it some other way.  Can we just change the beginning?

```diff
diff --git a/sage/symbolic/relation.py b/sage/symbolic/relation.py
--- a/sage/symbolic/relation.py
+++ b/sage/symbolic/relation.py
`@``@` -646,7 +646,8 `@``@` def solve(f, *args, **kwds):
         []
     """
     from sage.symbolic.expression import is_Expression
-    if is_Expression(f): # f is a single expression
+    # f is a single expression and there is a single variable
+    if is_Expression(f) and len(args) == 1: 
         ans = f.solve(*args,**kwds)
         return ans
```

 (This is completely untested.  Maybe we also need to check `is_SymbolicVariable(args[0])`...)

Some of the documentation things you mention are dealt with (to some extent) at #10444, which bitrotted a bit.

Your potential solution seems reasonable - really (as Jason implies in his post about the Python keywords issue) the args shouldn't go on without keywords in this case.   I wouldn't worry as much about the `is_Symbolic...` though I guess it couldn't hurt.

Oh, I didn't see your comment, so I wrote a new patch which adds the same documentation as in #10444, although not quite in the same way.  The attached patch passes doctests for me, at least for the patched file.  It just adds one new doctest, to illustrate that you can solve for a single equation with respect to more than one variable.

I'm marking as this as "needs review", but it may just be a first draft.  I certainly haven't tested it very thoroughly.

I think you changed the previous test, which is fine.  But we should catch the `solution_dict` issue as well (that is to say we should test that that error no longer occurs).  

To test this, one should especially try to make things which previously would have gone into `Expression.solve` break.  For instance, we would want to make sure multiplicities still could work as well as possible.  I think your code will keep that, but it's what would want to be checked.  I do not think I will have time to do that right now, sadly.

Someone would also want to just check whether this is enough to close #10444 as a dup, which jhpalmieri is suggesting and I suspect is true.

Changing keywords from "solve, maxima, Maxima" to "solve, maxima, Maxima, sd35.5".

Paul's problem is just that Maxima recognized that everything is a solution and returned `all`.

```
(%i1) solve(q=q,(w,y,z));
(%o1)                                 all
(%i2) solve(w=w,(w,y,z));
(%o2)                                 all
(%i3) solve(w=w,y);
(%o3)                                 all
(%i4) solve(w=w,w);
(%o4)                                 all
```

We would need to special-case this somehow.  Good eye!

Here's another [place](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1142/solving-multilinear-integer-equations) where someone might have run into this problem.  We should really fix this soon.

See also #13286, which is yet another inconsistency.

I think http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3526/ is probably related to this as well.
