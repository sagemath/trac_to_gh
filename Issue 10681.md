Keywords: demazure, root system, WeylCharacterRing, WeightRing, plot

Add the following enhancements to the `WeightRingElement` class:

1. `demazure_character` method for computing with Demazure operators in the `WeightRing`.

2. `plot` method for producing 2d plots of characters for the rank 2 root systems A2, B2, C2, and G2.

3. `degree` method to match the one in `WeylCharacterRing`. This computes the dimension of the corresponding module.

## Notes:

There is already code to compute with Demazure operators in the Crystals framework (see `demazure_character` in [ClassicalCrystals](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/categories/classical_crystals.html)). The code provided here lets one work directly in the `WeightRing`.

Suggestions for making the `plot` method more flexible would be appreciated. At the moment one can plot the roots and weights together, or just the weights alone. One can change the root (arrow) style, the weight (point) style, and the way that weight multiplicities are represented by point size.

I'm uploading a new patch (version 2)  which addresses suggestions from the sage-combinat-devel list. The changes are:

1. added doctests for the `_demazure` helper method 
2. many enhancements to `plot` incuding:
   a. plotting the weight lattice
   b. plotting the dominant Weyl chamber
   c. turned plotting the axes off by default

The plots produced by the four examples in the docstring for `plot` can be viewed here:
