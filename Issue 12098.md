#11869 computes roots of a polynomial without using them. See #12186 for an example and for indicator code. To do:

* move the "compatible embedding" code of #11869 to the beginning of the method, to avoid unnecessary root-finding

I'm a but confused.  Exactly where and when are roots unneccessarily computed?

In `/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` (as per #11869) the parts

* "# List of candidates for K(x)" and
* "# Find a common field F into which KF and LF both embed."

are independent. The first can be very slow, while the second is likely to fail. So I propose to swap these two parts.
