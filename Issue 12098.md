#11869 computes roots of a polynomial without using them. See #12186 for an example and for indicator code. To do:

 * move the "compatible embedding" code of #11869 to the beginning of the method, to avoid unnecessary root-finding

I'm a but confused.  Exactly where and when are roots unneccessarily computed?

Replying to [comment:1 jdemeyer]:

In `/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` (as per #11869) the parts

 * "# List of candidates for K(x)" and
 * "# Find a common field F into which KF and LF both embed."

are independent. The first can be very slow, while the second is likely to fail. So I propose to swap these two parts.

Thanks for the clarification.  I agree.

Sorry, newbie error, I did hg_commit() before I had tested the patch, hence there being two patches.
