It looks good overall. Here are my comments:

You do not need to create the entire list here:

```diff
-return sum([a * b for (a, b) in zip(cohomcoefs, C.basis().values())])
+return sum(a * b for (a, b) in zip(cohomcoefs, C.basis().values()))
```

Also, is that expected to work if `C.basis()` is empty (if that even occurs)?

Similar here

```diff
-if any([N1[n] != N2[n] for n in range(1, i + 1)]):
+if any(N1[n] != N2[n] for n in range(1, i + 1)):
```

and here

```diff
-if all([c.is_coboundary() for c in tocheck]):
+if all(c.is_coboundary() for c in tocheck):
```


Sage follows python convention of errors starting with lower case:

```
-raise NotImplementedError("The implemented criteria cannot determine formality")
+raise NotImplementedError("the implemented criteria cannot determine formality")
```


Our conventions for `INPUT:` docstrings:

```diff
-        - ``i`` -- integer; the degree up to which the formality is checked.
+        - ``i`` -- integer; the degree up to which the formality is checked
 
         - ``max_iterations`` -- integer (default: `3`); the maximum number of
-          iterations used in the computation of the minimal model.
+          iterations used in the computation of the minimal model
```


```diff
         - ``max_degree`` -- integer (default: `3`); the degree up to which the
-          numerical invariants are computed.
+          numerical invariants are computed
 
         - ``max_iterations`` -- integer (default: `3`); the maximum number of iterations
-          used to compute the minimal model, if it is not already cached.
+          used to compute the minimal model, if it is not already cached
```


It is not always a good idea to strictly follow PEP8 when writing code. It leads to things like this:

```
                                     ['x{}'.format(i)
                                         for i in range(len(chgens))],
```

where the break makes it harder to read the code. Not that this will cause me to hold up the ticket once everything else is done, but it might be worthwhile to go through and consider on the changes you made.

It is expected to return the zero element of a trivial cohomology group. It did return zero as an integer. I have forced a conversion to the corresponding cohomology group, and added a corresponding test.

It seems to be a problem with `CohomologyClass`. I did it `CachedRepresentation`, which seems to solve the problem of returning different representations in the same session. However, I still get errors every time I run the testsuite.

Is there any flag or environment variable that could affect the order in which the basis of a `CombinatorialFreeModule`are represented depending on the fact that we are in an interactive shell or running the testsuite?

I found that ithout `CachedRepresentation` , each time that the cohomology class of an element is computed, we get a different object. In particular, when we create the cohomology group, it takes as basis the specific instances of the cohomology classes of the generators that were created in that particular call. Hence, when we call it again, we get a different group.


That is, without `CachedRepresentation` we get this:


```
sage: A.<e1,e2,e3,e4,e5> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra({e5:e1*e2+e3*e4})
sage: B.inject_variables()
Defining e1, e2, e3, e4, e5
sage: a = e1*e3*e5-3*e2*e3*e5
sage: C = B.cohomology(3)
sage: a.cohomology_class() in C
False
```


Even if the parent of `a.cohomology_class()` should be `C` :


```
sage: C
Free module generated by {[e1*e2*e5 - e3*e4*e5], [e1*e3*e5], [e2*e3*e5], [e1*e4*e5], [e2*e4*e5]} over Rational Field
sage: a.cohomology_class().parent()
Free module generated by {[e1*e2*e5 - e3*e4*e5], [e1*e3*e5], [e2*e3*e5], [e1*e4*e5], [e2*e4*e5]} over Rational Field
```


They look the same, but are different objects because they have been created with different  generators.

Indeed:


```
sage: B.cohomology(3) is B.cohomology(3)
False
sage: B.cohomology(3) == B.cohomology(3)
False
```
