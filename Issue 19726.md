This will break the “Help” links in the (classic) notebook, won't it? More generally, though I entirely agree with the goal of this ticket, I'm not sure people like the change.

Everything which is compiled/built/installed in the Sage distribution ends up in `$SAGE_LOCAL`... except the documentation. So it's logical to put the built documentation in `$SAGE_LOCAL` too.

> At the very least it would be something where "deprecation" would be useful?

Well, you cannot really deprecate filesystem paths. But a symbolic link can be done indeed.
