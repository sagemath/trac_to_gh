`sage -docbuild --warn-links` stops when a class is inherited from "object" with

```
<autodoc>:1: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: object
```

E.g. this shows up on 
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/structure/sage/structure/sage_object.html

Similarly, if a class is inherited from `collections.Iterator`, then one sees a black (non-linked)

```
_abcoll.Iterator
```

in the doc (or with --warn-links stops building the doc).

As it seems that this is a bug in the Python documentation, I've tried the approach suggested on StackOverflow and added


```
nitpick_ignore = [('py:class', 'object')]
```

to `src/doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`. Then, when trying to build `reference/structure`, the errors regarding `object` actually disappeared, and the build process was aborted when some other broken links were found.

Hello everybody,

I used this stackoverflow trick in #20095, which adds it to `conf_sub.py`.
