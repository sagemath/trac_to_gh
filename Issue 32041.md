I have implemented the initial functions for the usage of `B-terms` in `AsymptoticRing`.

I have three doctest errors:

This looks pretty functional already. Here are some remarks:

2. `AsymptoticExpansion.B`, `AsymptoticRing.B`, `BTerm`: The docstring, in particular: the description of `valid_from`, should mention the "short syntax" where passing a number instead of a dictionary uses the number as the lower bound for all variables occurring in the term.

3. `AsymptoticExpansion.B` - Is there a particular reason that `valid_from` is just a positional argument, and not a keyword argument with default value 0 (like for `AsymptoticRing.B`?)

4. `NotImplementedBZeroError`: Maybe add a straightforward test like
    {{{
    sage: AR.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^QQ', QQ)
    sage: AR(0).B(42)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedBZero: got B(0)
    The error term B(0) means 0 for sufficiently large n.

I thought it is not important to make the `valid_from` a keyword argument in `AsymptoticExpansion.B`, since it is already a keyword argument in `AsymptoticRing.B`. I changed it now, because I think it is more correct to have it this way.

> since it is already a keyword argument in `AsymptoticRing.B`

I see. I think it makes sense to make sure the type of arguments are consistent across the methods.


5. `sage: (2*x).B({x: 20}) # indirect doctest` -- this is actually not indirect, there you do use `AsymptoticExpansion.B`.

6. "If you pass only a number as `valid_from`": I suggest to rephrase this as "If a number is passed to `valid_from`, ...".
