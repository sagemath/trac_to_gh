Keywords: Finite topological spaces, Discrete Morse theory

This is a continuation of the work started in tickets #30400, #30447. It is expected to add methods about computing homology groups of h-regular spaces. Also, the computation of homologically admissible Morse matchings (or Discrete Vector Fields, DVF) will be implemented allowing to apply the Discrete Morse Theory for finite spaces described in [(1)](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271523/1-s2.0-S0166864112X00099/1-s2.0-S0166864112002374/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDmTNnG8W%2Fd62TtRhguZ2OGfatSh5PjuSC1prGKKPATdAIgE%2FtPbtI68MPGJVaFLiuJtQVFsFOGRsn2o5dI7F%2BY%2BE0qvQMIy%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARADGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJTIPNDfS4pSjWFFeCqRA7wQyQztlerxOBiDBHhQjYSIT0MhHPa9LZ1rL08jwqRpIt5gxpnqtZw%2BNf2%2Fn5KVd2u5fiIkkQBVPrpc6py%2Bj4HUzJP8LYAH6LTT63BK4WZHhSKdurLpAsjS0DXNKvK7EixaY7SPR9nHo2S8%2B5L%2BMcMFHzzZ8z55DToj83xFZOKJsKjU1HdvXLr9abkUCdDTtHuqahb1Sqem5Fophx0Pms1JzKsEAo9A8srM0a7YBq8oxISR%2FiUc0LiEpbYoa5aAAxhgOz%2BJQW7SzFiprb7xlbY9bvau6nEvC5DEUovsbbylYDyFTphPTZ%2FpaAbNO%2Fpd8lCIDpEzyu75zSJz%2FXUAsei3CzEEFKSlFOnlxN8JT1n9AE6j%2FA6%2FjjAG33GsvqpPvkNDJ1%2BNvzrZggbQTPNqdwE6eXDqduDeKxaYZk%2B9xbIvx2lhh3EvTGbCPf%2Fkrk%2BM9rHXphOSsw1iwONrBdnT2tSXZfJyHjY%2FqkTVUQ8LfWUTxr4qjwVT41eQ6L4PRoa3Wckor8Md73SrRUriTopKgbZ0MMKSiP0FOusBaRwUUc%2BST9eMsptRcepoDB1YX9BzAO4DUi%2BsSUTmTW%2F31sqx4RTzMC5bgPAIWpEygQcwlafLCUAbAA8zzAYi4aRfP68aEZABvPH5SlZbYIFglO9ruLACGGG0Q6g84dIsNGZKVy0NSbVXYUGRlLVsw2R88f1ghs%2FV4sdfjSUBaR8mtSSbFXwI0S0OPbLun2y46sR2TInA4uWNXxkh75T9iBhuMDQ6Jas%2Bhy545jmlW%2FPgYLYW5Zpm37mqt3LputK28eEmVpiQ3nrlKxFffXgj%2BHMACtbqA1%2FqGwjEE%2Bh4ECHHhWz97R25C7H8gw%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20201104T031219Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY6WRIEF42%2F20201104%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=aea194b685b563c29251307dab5f93812aef8ea2b5b8ad2da4db45eb655a3979&hash=26c1be05d17e2d66bc1cd5f067b58a1de002f6a5895f2977b099aa413c3f9145&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0166864112002374&tid=spdf-2723ffb8-e00a-4efe-a556-f635ca8868a5&sid=5356ab0089f0f546ae1baa9-33d1eae0b440gxrqa&type=client) and [(2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166864116303182).

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
