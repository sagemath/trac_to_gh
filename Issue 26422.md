`@`slabbe In the method breadth_first_search_iterator(self,max_depth=None),               
the algorithm uses a python set to determine the next elements to discover.     
                                                                                
As we have no information on those elements, it is correct to use generic set.
The problem is that python3 is not determinist when it iterates on elements of a set.

This feature make the tests complex : we need to guess all the possibilities and accept all the correct answers.

A solution is to have a parameter 'order=None'. If the parameter is None, the implementation doesn't change. If order is a function giving a total order on the elements of the set, then, the algorithm will discover all the elements by choosing elements (when needed) with the help of that order.

`@`reviewer: Related to boussica [comment:3](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26659#comment:3). The test : `sage: [next(it_breadth) for _ in range(10)]` line 70 file `recursively_enumerated_set.pyx` give different results in py2 and py3 because of that problem. 

For now i have modified the test on 13 elements instead of 10 in order to have all elements "of depth 2 and less" in all cases.
