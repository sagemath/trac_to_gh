The dimension of a cone is defined to be the dimension of the span of its generators. It then makes sense to define the codimension as the dimension of the orthogonal complement of that span. This number is equal to the lineality (see trac #18696) of the dual cone.

Same comments as for #18696 and:
- I'd prefer using "self" to "this collection of rays" in the documentation. That class seemed natural to me as a base of both cones and rays, yet by itself it seems not particularly useful and all doctest examples actually rely on cones. So I think users of `cone.codim?` will be confused by the mention of a ray collection. If you prefer to avoid "self", perhaps "cone/fan" combination can be used instead?
