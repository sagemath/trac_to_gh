Patch to configure.ac and configure (not automagically autoreconf, but made by hand, as the former solution produces far too much).

Changing keywords from "" to "r cygwin".

> Doing my homework.
If the word "cygwin" occurs anywhere in their source code (and the configure has that whole section), they have no right to treat you like this.  Vewy wude.   And why wouldn't they want to support Cygwin?

Also, I don't understand why they don't have a web-browsable source.  Or actually, [they do](https://github.com/wch/r-source), but it's not apparently linked from the page...

Sure, that was rude.
I don't plan on fighting for that.

Volker: in case you're in a reviewing mood, this one is awfully simple...
