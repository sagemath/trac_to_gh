CC:  @nbruin @vbraun @mkoeppe @spaghettisalat

invoking `maxima` in a Sage script leads to a zombie process. E.g.
run the following in terminal

```
echo "t=maxima('2+2')" > /tmp/foo.sage && ./sage /tmp/foo.sage
```
and observe zombie `maxima` process after this terminates.

A slightly shorter

```
echo "t=maxima('2+2')" | ./sage
```
does not lead to a zombie - in fact, it prints on exit:

```
sage: sage: Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.08s, Wall time 0m0.67s).
Exiting Maxima with PID 2318 running <SAGEROOT>/local/bin/maxima -p <SAGEROOT>/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sage-maxima.lisp
```

This was observed while testing `sagetex` spkg with `SAGE_CHECK=yes make sagetex` on #32887.

This was the correct guess.
If I remove `--disable-threads` then no zombies pop up.

Can this also be done on macOS?

macOS is sufficiently different from Linux, I'm not surprised. I noticed that Homebrew builds ecl with threads enabled, so the change proposed here should be fine on macOS too.

Not sure about cygwin though.

I am fairly certain that this is a race condition and enabling threads will not help in general.

Attaching a debugger to the maxima zombie process shows that the process hangs in a loop where it tries to flush the standard output, gets an error, tries to report that error to the standard error stream, then gets an error for that and so on. The following script

```
import atexit
atexit.register(lambda : maxima.quit())
t=maxima('2+2')
```

works fine and leaves no maxima zombies.

I don't have time to dig into the maxima interface code, but I am pretty sure that sage just doesn't shut down maxima properly.

Sounds related to https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/634?

The fact that it works with threads enabled could be due to https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/129. If that's the case then indeed we shouldn't rely on it.

The pexpect interface has been deprecated forever, so it's not unlikely. And I don't think adding a `quit()` hook could hurt in any case.

No, it's not. We have 2 maxima interfaces. `maxima_calculus` is the unique instance of the library-based interface and is for internal use by symbolics. `maxima` is the user-facing interface and is pexpect-based.

The pexpect interface is convenient if you want multiple sessions (managed through different processes) and if you want "vanilla" maxima: the maxima_lib one has some tweaks and configurations motivated by its use for SR.

But when is that string sent to the running maxima process? I meant something like comment:31.

I see now that there's a function called `quit_sage()` in `src/sage/all.py`,

```python
def quit_sage(verbose=True):
    """                                                                                                                                                                      
    If you use Sage in library mode, you should call this function

which kills all running pexpect processes. And apparently you are supposed to call this function yourself. So, I guess we can blame sagetex for not calling `quit_sage()` at the end of the scripts it generates? =)

Yes, obviously. (Or something like that). I only use sage as a library, and I just learned about that function 20 minutes ago. It's outrageous to expect the user to manually clean up after the library.
