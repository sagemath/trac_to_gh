In #23392 I correct "are are", but actually


```
grep --no-filename -o -P -R '\b([a-z]{2,}) \1\b' src/sage | sort -u
```


founds 71 repeated word. Some of them are false positive like "very very". Correct others.

All this seems to be good. Do you want to do more in this ticket, or me to compile, test and review?
