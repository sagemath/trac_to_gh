# Issue 3452: implement inline error reporting for registration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3452

Original creator: TimothyClemans

Original creation time: 2008-06-17 22:28:52

Assignee: boothby

Currently when a user has incorrectly filled out the registration form she is sent to a page that states the error.

The error should be reported under the input box related to the error. Also form should stay filled in except for the password input boxes.
