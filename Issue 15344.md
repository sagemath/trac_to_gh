The technical reasoning:

In #13872, I implemented `e0` and `f0` operators for KR tableaux and rigged configurations by mapping to their corresponding `KirillovReshetikhinCrystal` element, then applying `e0` and `f0` (respecitvely) there, and then pulling back. Previously they just returned `None`. In `_test_stembridge_local_axioms()`, it checks to see that `e(i)` and `e(j)` are both not `None`, which now there is a longer check if that's true, and if so, then it must perform the Stembridge axioms check. This is why the tests now take significantly longer than before.

The proposed solution:

Make the crystals smaller.

I made the really long tests now on (much) smaller crystals. I also moved one example to a better spot.
