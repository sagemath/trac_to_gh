See [this ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2927/update-animatepy-for-gif-creation-using-ffmpeg) question. The option `-loop_output` for ffmpeg is deprecated and instead one should use `-loop`.

Or, is this possibly fixed in the doc fixes for #12827?

I think this has already been fixed. According to the `search_src` function, "loop_output" only appears in the file animate.py, and in that file it only appears in comments.
