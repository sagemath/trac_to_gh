# Issue 12505: Make the doctests of sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec independent of ``Poset``

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2012-03-16 16:11:52

sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec uses Poset as example in its doctests. Thus, each time Poset is modified, this file (and its analogue in sagenb) needs to be updated. 

This patch replaces the doctest by one that does not depend on other Sage sources. #12536 depends on it.

Looks good to me. Unless the PatchBot gives error messages, we can set a positive review.
