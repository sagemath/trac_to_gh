It's worth considering to migrate from Sage's custom documentation style to one of the more established/standarized ones such as:
- [pep257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
- [​https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods google]

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31044

I like that the inputs and outputs are highlighted in our style, whereas some others are more freeform. The numpy style appeals to me for this reason. The standard Python documentation is another model we could use, and its familiarity might be an advantage.

We are also not using the default Sphinx setup except in a few spots (like simplicial complexes: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/topology/sage/topology/simplicial_complex.html#sage.topology.simplicial_complex.Simplex). We could head in this direction, too.

I don't understand the quote "Google style tends to be easier to read for short and simple docstrings, whereas NumPy style tends be easier to read for long and in-depth docstrings" from the napoleon web page. I don't care that much about which is easier to read in raw form — I care more about how they are rendered by Sphinx, and we should have a lot of control over that. Or am I missing something?

Would it be an option to implement this for the style Sage currently uses? I would expect this to be more manageable than changing every docstring to a different style.

It's certainly possible but napoleon's parsing is already quite involved and we would need to duplicate that.

By using a standard convention for docstrings we would also get all the other advantages that come with following standards like:
- Easier onboarding of newcomers that don't need to learn a new syntax for docstrings.
- IDEs interpret standard docstrings properly and provide the doc as well as type information in a nicely formatted way. Example:
<img src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2021.3/docstring_example_10_quick_documentation.png" 520px>
- IDEs support generating docstrings in the right format. Example:
<img src="https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring/raw/master/images/demo.gif" 700px>
- There exist proper linter for the docstring format like [pycodestyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/index.html). In contrast, our "linter" currently uses a couple of regex to check that its "TESTS" instead of "TEST".

The migration can also be very fluent; for example, if one introduces a new method or change an existing one then one uses a standard docstring format. Thus, over time the codebase gets slowly migrated.
