```
sage: P = Poset((divisors(12), attrcall("divides")), facade=True, linear_extension=True)
sage: list(P)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
sage: P.is_linear_extension([1,2,4,3,6,12,1337])
True
sage: P.is_linear_extension([1,2,4,3,6,666,12,1337])
True
```


At the moment I am not planning to do anything about it, since it would probably involving seeing what other parts of the code using `is_linear_extension` and how they are using (my bets that this error doesn't cause any other problems in the code, and fixing it would likely incur some speed penalty so one should keep the old functionality accessible).

Good fix, but sage/combinat/posets/linear_extension.py still is trying to work around this bug:

            sage: L = P.linear_extensions()
            sage: L([1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 12]) in L
