The wrapper script installed by our autotools package (from `build/pkgs/autotools/autofoo`)
depends on the SAGE_LOCAL variable. Not a good idea; we can do better.

Replying to [comment:5 embray]:
> What is autofoo?

It's a script which gets installed as `autoconf`, `automake`, ... to automatically run the "correct" version of `autoconf`, `automake`, ...

Needs review - which is easy and independent of other build tickets.
Can test by using 

```
  ./sage -f autotools
  export PATH=`pwd`/local/bin:$PATH
  autoreconf
```

(_outside_ of a `sage-sh`).

This tiny patch still needs review...

Please bump the package version. We need a way to tell people they have to update their package, adding a `.p0` should do just that.

Let's close this ticket in favor of the removal of the autotools package (#29174).
