This removes the `$PIP_INSTALL` environment variable in favor of a new `sdh_pip_install` helper function in `sage-dist-helpers`.  This is consistent with the purpose of the library of build helper functions, and is hopefully the last time such a mass change should be made.

(I realize in #21441#comment:36 I argued against making more mass updates to replace `PIP_INSTALL`, but I'm not wild about the environment variable either, and now that the helper functions exist this seems like the best approach for consistency's sake.)

The only change this makes to the `spkg-install` scripts is a bulk `sed`.

The problem with waiting is that there could be new conflicting tickets popping up. But I will leave it to you to decide what to do.

Oh I see what you're saying now--keep `PIP_INSTALL` for now and still use it in brial and dot2tex.  Not exactly a happy thing but it makes sense.

The question is: Should I open a separate ticket for later removal of `PIP_INSTALL` entirely?  I think yes...

In `appnope`, you removed the error check:

```diff
-    $PIP_INSTALL . || exit $?
+    sdh_pip_install .
```


Given that you did not add such a check to `sdh_pip_install` (it would make sense to do that though), this is wrong.
