The docbuild was failing for me, and it was hard to track down where the original error occurred because there was no (proper) traceback information. In this ticket, such a traceback information is added for exceptions in the docbuild worker.

That makes sense. In #31344, no exception is thrown but the process ends with an error code, which then triggers 

```
        if exitcode != 0:
            raise WorkerDiedException(f"worker for {task[1]} died with non-zero exit code {w.exitcode}")

In this case, no stacktrac is added since this information is simply not available. The worker needs to throw an exception (including a stacktrace) so that the exception handler in

```
         try:
             result = target(task)
         except BaseException as exc:
             queue.put((None, exc))
             queue.put((None, RemoteExceptionWrapper(exc)))

is invoked. This needs changes to the particular worker, and should be done in a follow-up issue.

Hm, this is even better. But now another refactoring is suggesting itself. Instead of,


```python
def __reduce__(self):
    def _rebuild_exc(exc: BaseException, tb: str):
        """
        Reconstructs the exception, putting the original exception as cause.
        """
        exc.__cause__ = RemoteException(tb)
        return exc

    return _rebuild_exc, (self.exc, self.tb)
```


couldn't we just do


```python
def __reduce__(self):
    self.exc.__cause__ =  RemoteException(self.tb)
    return self.exc
```


?

I also think we'll need doctests for the new classes/methods even if they're pretty trivial. Otherwise our coverage goes down.

I don't have much experience with pickling, but https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__reduce__ says that either a string or tuple should be returned.

My solution also didn't worked as `__reduce__` cannot return locally defined methods. So I've converted it to a static instance method as you initially suggested.

> I also think we'll need doctests for the new classes/methods even if they're pretty trivial. Otherwise our coverage goes down.

I've added a doctest for the reduce method. The other methods are still covered by the existing doctests.

and (after):


```
$ sage -coverage src/sage_docbuild/utils.py 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage_docbuild/utils.py: 28.6% (2 of 7)

Missing documentation:
     * line 16: def __init__(self, tb:str)
     * line 19: def __str__(self)
     * line 32: def __init__(self, exc:BaseException)
     * line 65: def __init__(self, message:Optional[str], original_exception:Optional[BaseException]=None)

Missing doctests:
     * line 42: def _rebuild_exc(exc:BaseException, tb:str)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


Normally the patchbots would have complained (see the "coverage" plugin), but in this case I think the special nature of the sage_docbuild package avoided it.

I've been on the other side of this argument more than once, so I feel for you, but the developer's guide still states that every function needs a docstring: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings
