# Issue 10011: Set _pari_prime when initializing NumberFieldIdeal from a PARI prime ideal

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10012

Keywords: pari prime ideal

When a `NumberFieldIdeal` is initialized from a PARI prime ideal, it would be good to set `self._pari_prime` to that PARI prime ideal. Then `self.is_prime()` will not have to compute anything for example.

Patch looks good and applies fine to 4.6.rc0.  I'm now doing a full test.
