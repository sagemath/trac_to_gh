Hi,this is my first sumbmission. Just started with a first version of shamir secret sharing.
The idea is to add more secure multiparty computation (SMC) primitives in crypto.
If OK, there is more to come.

please use the new syntax for raising errors, namely

```
raise ValueError('this is the message here')
```

instead of

```
raise ValueError, 'the message was there'
```

you should rather not change the name of the patch at every new version..

for the patchbot:  apply only trac15147_smc_v1.1.patch

could you please replace

```
612–613. doi:10.1145/359168.359176
```

by

```
612-613. :doi:`10.1145/359168.359176`
```

The long dash is not a standard character, and the doi can be a link to the article.
