Keywords: expand, polynomial, polynomial ring

Verified on 'Sage Version 4.6, Release Date: 2010-10-30' on my laptop and on nt.sagemath.org.

If I do this:

```
R.<x,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
phi(x) = x^2 + c
def iterkate(n):
    pol = x
    for i in range(1,n):
        pol = phi(pol)
    return pol
g = expand(iterkate(7))
```

Then I get this on the last command:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

But if I do this

```
R.<x,c> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
g = expand( (((((x^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c)^2 + c )
```

Then it is perfectly happy and g is a degree 64 polynomial (but in both cases it's the same polynomial I'm asking it to expand!).  In the first example, it will crash if the "7" is anything above about 6.  At 6, it is unreliable, and crashes sometimes.  5 and lower seems fine.  I wasn't sure how to pare down to a more minimal example, given the circumstances.

It's entirely possible I'm doing something stupid here and interacting with sage in a bad way.  If so, it's still a bug, but I'd love to know what I'm doing that sage doesn't like.

Anyway, here's some debug info:

```

FWIW I see crashes on 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.rc0; I tried to apply the patches from #9880 but no luck.

I tested on sage 4.6.1 (debian in a vm) and got similar segfaults (SIGSEGV and SIGBUS, from 6).

Installing the fixed pynac from #9880 seems to fix the problem (tested till 9).

I put the patched spkg here (http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/pynac-0.2.1-patched.spkg) if someone else wants to try it.

It ran until `expand(iterkate(9)) on sage 4.6.2.rc0 (on debian, real machine, intel quad core smthg), with 10 it ate too much memory.`

`So I guess it is the same (kind of) problem as in #9880 (so it should be marked as duplicate).`

The bug stated there "disappeared" with 4.6.1, that one seem to disappear with 4.6.2 but they are kind of random and other bug of this kind could still appear with new versions.
