# Issue 10455: Update ATLAS to version 3.9.32

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2010-12-21 12:39:50

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: ATLAS

Update to the developer release atlas-3.9.32 according to advice of Clint Whaley. The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in `/patches`. The lapack spkg is no longer needed and will be removed.

I rewrote the ATLAS spkg-install (see also #10226) to
  * python only without relying on other script languages
  * allow customization of architectural defaults via the new `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` environment variable.
  * still build a reasonable library if the automatic tuning process fails to find accurate timings.
  * `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path` now searches in `path/libatlas.so` instead of `path/lib/libatlas.so` so it works for people with atlas in `/lib64`, too.
  * Threading is now enabled by default. Whats the point of trying to squeeze more performance out of modern processors if you run on one core only?

By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings, if that fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`.

From the new `SPKG.txt`:

```
The package can be configured via two environment variables:

 * SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path
   If this environment variable is set, path/libatlas.so is used
   and ATLAS is not compiled.

 * SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=arch[,isaext1][,isaext2]...[,isaextN]
   The given architectural default and instruction set extensions are
   used instead of the empirical tuning. Available architectures are 

     POWER3, POWER4, POWER5, PPCG4, PPCG5, POWER6, POWER7, P5, P5MMX,
     PPRO, PII, PIII, PM, CoreSolo, CoreDuo, Core2Solo, Core2, Corei7,
     P4, P4E, Efficeon, K7, HAMMER, AMD64K10h, UNKNOWNx86, IA64Itan,
     IA64Itan2, USI, USII, USIII, USIV, UST2, UnknownUS, MIPSR1xK,
     MIPSICE9

   and instruction set extensions are 
   
     VSX, AltiVec, SSE3, SSE2, SSE1, 3DNow   

   In addition, you can also set

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast picks defaults for a modern (2-3 year old)
      CPU of your processor line, and 

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base picks defaults that should work for a ~10
      year old CPU.

   For example, 

     SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei7,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1

   would be appropriate for a Core i7 CPU.
```

Note that you cannot just use `sage -f atlas-3.9.32.spkg` to update atlas only. Many other spkgs use blas/lapack and must be rebuilt. The easiest way is to do a separate Sage installation...

The cvxopt spkg needs to be updated to link correctly with this atlas release, see #10509.

Does it mean that LAPACK spkg can be removed, too?


---

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-12-21 16:00:06

Yes, the lapack spkg can be removed.

I'm still trying to debug some issues with linbox...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2010-12-21 20:47:10

BLAS can also be removed if we go with this. f2c which was used before we got ATLAS to provide cblas by f2c-ing the BLAS
package should also be removed (I think it listed in scipy's dependency only).

on 32-bit x86 Linux (Debian squeeze) I get the following, when trying to install the spkg (applied the patches to a pristine Sage 4.6.1.alpha3):

Hi Dima,

I think the problem is

This fails because `ATL_NCPU` is not set. Do you have a single-core processor? I guess the threaded libraries are not built in that case.

yes, it's single-core. An old Pentium M. (Atlas 3.8 spkg does not build on it, at all)

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-12-22 15:37:54

I changed the `spkg-install` to make only single-threaded shared libraries if necessary. Should work now. 

For simplicity, I made spkgs for cvxopts and sage_scripts. So you need to add

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.9.32.spkg
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/cvxopt-1.1.3.p0.spkg
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/sage_scripts-4.6.1.alpha3.p0.spkg

to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` and then
  * replace `spkg/install` with the attached version (Note that `sage_scripts` overwrites this file during installation, aargh)
  * replace `spkg/standard/deps` with the attached version.

I'm still having doctest errors with linbox...

It builds OK, but then testlong gives quite a bit of failures:

I do not know how many of them are Atlas related, though.

A lot of it is probably related. Was this a build from scratch?
linbox calls seem to be particularly affected, there are a lot of failures in that
path:
sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense._charpoly_linbox
stuff going through:
sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense.right_kernel
is also affected and that smells like atlas at work too.

I must say we have observed a number of failures related to ATLAS-3.9.23 in 
sage-on-gentoo:
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3)
you have failure there too but not due to iml/ATLAS as far as I can see.
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/6](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/6)
more subtle.
I see you have the failure with devel/sage/sage/finance/time_series.pyx
you may want to look the comment I wrote about it in the section 
"known test failures for Sage on Gentoo":
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/wiki/Known-test-failures](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/wiki/Known-test-failures)
note that sage-on-gentoo can use (c)blas-reference, ATLAS or gsl-cblas or some combinations - in fact amd and intel libraries could in principle be used but
no one I know has tried.
[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/blas-lapack.xml](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/blas-lapack.xml)

Not sure about the SIGFPE, it could come from a result rounded to 0 or the like.

yes, it's a build from scratch, on the same machine (old Pentium M) as already discussed above.

I wonder if these are Atlas bugs, or Linbox bugs...

One should try an OSX build.

why OS X in particular? I could do that but not before the 5th of January, when
my university reopens. Ok I could do it before that but I'll enjoy the break a 
little bit more :)

Or does OSX remain disabled for Atlas, i.e. it's not built?

I had forgotten about that. I checked the spkg and ATLAS is not built on
cygwin and OS X. So it makes sense.

I get the same doctest errors. Most of them are linbox related. The SIGFPE is from converting a NAN into a GMP integer, but I haven't gotten to the root of the NAN yet. In trying to debug this I've noticed that there are a bunch of valgrind warnings in the linbox code path we are using. I've asked some more specific questions on the linbox-use mailinglist:

https://groups.google.com/d/topic/linbox-use/N3QNNOQuTAc/discussion

But so far no final conclusion.

I notice you say it is a Pentium M, yet ATLAS is compiling things 
with the assumption that it is a coreduo:
-DATL_ARCH_CoreDuo -DATL_CPUMHZ=800 -DATL_SSE3 -DATL_SSE2 -DATL_SSE1 -DATL_GAS_x8632
I am guessing the speed is right but the rest is not. Was your successful build
using these parameters? I had in one instance a non-working ATLAS because the
cpu type was misdetected (wanted to use sse3 when it didn't have them). The build
was curiously successful but the library was unusable.

The processor is Pentium M
Banias 1.1GHz, http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=27600
(according to GotoBlas installation procedure :-))

The Atlas built is not totally useless, it works for many doctests.
By the way, 3.8 also thinks it's a CoreDuo. And it works. I saw somewhere a note that it's OK.

Converting a NAN into a GMP integer is exactly what was happening in [https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/3](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/3) and it didn't happen when using gslcblas. I will do a full build of sage-on-gentoo with 3.9.40 (or 41) and see if I can see anything.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-05-25 22:42:39

Yuck, still got problems leading to linbox, I got the ones leading to iml too. Note that using another cblas like gslcblas/openblas/reference(netlib) all these problems disappear which seem to indicate that there is something going on in ATLAS itself or that all the others gets it wrong (I realise that on a stock sage you may have trouble compiling iml with anything else than ATLAS, it requires some patching  to the configure script to be able to do so).

It may be worth noting that new released are available for both stable and development:

[Stable](http://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/files/Stable/3.8.4/)
[Unstable](http://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/files/Developer%20%28unstable%29/3.9.41/)


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-06-01 03:08:03

I have 3.9.41 now, the only difference was it compiled faster because there was tuning for  my cpu. But we could investigate 3.8.4.
Thanks for pointing it is out, some of us (me at least) didn't think it would ever happen. We may have a stable ATLAS supporting newer CPUs at last, and it looks like I could test it quickly.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-06-01 04:33:51

OK 3.8.4 doesn't suffer from any of the drawbacks that are apparent in 3.9.23+.

The big drawback is that it doesn't build lapack nicely on its own, provided we point to the sources like the latest 3.9.xx do. That means spkg-install would need a little bit more work.

Opinions?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2011-06-01 04:37:02

Can we keep this ticket focused on the development version of atlas and discuss the stable ATLAS on #10226? I updated the spkg on the latter ticket to the new stable ATLAS release.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2011-06-01 04:50:45

Sure. My current opinion and that's something I am pushing to sage-on-gentoo users is to avoid ATLAS 3.9.xx for the time being. It is possible that ATLAS-3.9.xx is doing something permissible that iml and linbox are not ready to catch. My line of thought is that I remember that some algorithm in iml takes the inverse of a result returned by cblas. If the result is 0 instead of a small value we may have our NaN, more likely some result from ATLAS is a NaN.

Note that you can copy updated spkgs into `spkg/standard/` and then do

```sh
env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make build
```

to rebuild all dependent packages.

(We should perhaps add `make` targets for that to the top-level Makefile and document them in the Developer's Guide, as this is currently just a side-effect of the effort to make upgrading work.)

If you at the same time need to apply patches to the Sage library, things get a bit more complicated, as e.g. Sage switches to the `main` branch before reinstalling the Sage library package. One safe way is to first apply the patches, create a new `sage-x.y.z-whatever` spkg (with `devel/sage/spkg-dist`) and *replace* the one in `spkg/standard/` with that one (or at least make sure `newest_version` will pick up the right one).

Note that the extension modules' dependencies in `module_list.py` are currently far from complete. #8664 adds _some_ in a generic way by adding them automatically in `setup.py`, i.e. lets modules also depend on the headers of the libraries they use (which [only] works if the headers' mtimes get modified / updated during installation of their corresponding libraries). The dumb alternative is to run `sage -ba-force` after an "upgrade" process.

Several issues:
 * atlas is now at version 3.9.49 (last I checked)
 * I have reports of it failling to build on some old opterons
 * `@`dimpase: do you need atlas on OS X ppc? Don't you use vectorize like the other OS X?
 * I haven't checked but I am quite sure from other reports that cblas_dgem{m,v} is still buggy (someone posted that R built against that Atlas lapack was giving them trouble and R upstream pointed the finger to Atlas).

so what? I have a 5-year old 32-bit Intel laptop on which the sage-current Atlas does not build.

>  * `@`dimpase: do you need atlas on OS X ppc? Don't you use vectorize like the other OS X?

indeed. But that's for #10509. Oops, was posting on the wrong ticket...

Seems like #12011 isn't a duplicate after all...


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-09 09:43:53

Obviously, the patches to `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps` must be rebased.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-09 10:11:21

It makes a lot more sense to me to put the `LAPACK` tarball at the top level of the spkg instead of in `patches/`.

`patches/ATLAS-lib/autom4te.cache` should be removed.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-09 10:14:51

I don't like using `assert` for control flow, because that's not what it's meant for.

Why not replace those by (see #13210)

```
if rc != 0:
    print "Error: foo"
    sys.exit(rc)
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-09 10:17:20

There is something wrong with the history in `SPKG.txt` (atlas-3.8.4 is completely missing and there is atlas-3.9.68 for #12011 which never got merged)


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-09 11:03:13

I don't have any strong opinion on where to put the lapack tarball, except that our convention of only allowing a single `src/` directory is shortsighted. 

Note that I'm not using assertions for control flow, i.e. I'm not using

```
  try:
    <command>
  except AssertionError:
    <alternative>
```

Note that you could theoretically also catch the `SystemExit` exception, so `sys.exit()` isn't different from `assert` in that regard. I'm only using assertions to ensure the following contract holds: `spkg-install` completes successfully only if the relevant atlas configure/make completed with `rc==0`

I'll replace the asserts by something that returns rc as exit code, though.

I think (IMHO but I might be wrong) that assertions should be used only in a situation where an assertion being false indicates a bug in the program.  If `rc != 0` in `spkg-install`, that is an ordinary error condition, not a bug in the `spkg-install` script.

it's most probably not at Atlas problem, but rather that 1e-14 (any solid rationale behind this choice? I guess not.) needs to be adjusted.

3.10.0 has just been released a few hours ago. Do we try to go for it? Like Jeroen remarked there may be tolerance issues depending on the hardware. I know I have one when using openblas instead of ATLAS.

The new spkg will attempt to build on OSX if `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` is set. Untested, but a start.

I also am planning to allow `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=system` and use `ldconfig -p` to get the system atlas, if available. Though perhaps we should do that in a later version. This spkg seems to fix some build issues that people reported on the sage mailinglists so it might be good to get it in sooner rather than later.

+1, let's not worry now about changing the working of `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-12 13:30:21

In `spkg-install`, I find it confusing that you have a function `build()` which calls `configure()` and `make_atlas()`.

I would get rid of `build()` and simply call `configure()` and `make_atlas()` directly.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-12 13:30:36

About `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`: at one point you are checking

```
os.environ.has_key('SAGE_FAT_BINARY')
```

and at another you are checking

```
os.environ.get('SAGE_FAT_BINARY', 'no') == 'yes' and conf['Intel?']
```


I think the correct check is

```
os.environ.get('SAGE_FAT_BINARY', 'no') == 'yes'
```

"SAGE_FAT_BINARY" has evolved to mean "build a generic binary on any processor", so it's not Intel specific anymore. Just call `configure_base()`.

Detail: in `system_with_flush()`, your `print` command should not have a space after "Running".  The space is automatically added by `print`.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-12 15:02:46

Updated spkg to remove the space and make the `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` check uniform.

I'm fine with the doctests patch...


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-12 15:06:15

I'm always calling `build()` except in one place where I want to allow `configure()` to fail (because throttling is enabled).

I've noticed before that the build time for the "generic" binary is rather long. Its not entirely generic, it is still doing timing for cache edges. But the result will be a working library, it won't probe funky asm implementations that other CPUs might not support. I'll ask on the ATLAS mailinglist for clarification.

I can beat that:


```
Finished installing shared ATLAS library.

real	821m14.881s
user	739m58.560s
sys	58m23.440s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.0
```


(That's with `sage -f ...` on an otherwise idle machine, an AMD Fusion E-450 running Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64.)

It took far more time than building _all of Sage_ [in parallel, on that dual-core CPU], including the old ATLAS spkg.  I currently have no figures for a _separate_ ATLAS 3.8.4 build, but the timings from previous parallel Sage builds on that machine vary between


```
real	214m52.096s
user	175m5.390s
sys	9m56.210s

and


```
real	256m32.949s
user	217m30.760s
sys	10m31.050s
Successfully installed atlas-3.8.4.p1
```


(The LAPACK and BLAS spkg build times in these builds are a few minutes and less than one minute [wall time], respectively.)

I was actually hoping ATLAS 3.9.x / 3.10 meanwhile "knows" these AMD CPUs and therefore builds at least a bit _faster_...

We have noticed the building time increase in Gentoo as well. At 3.9.82 I think. Apparently they have changed how they detect the compiler and that's what causing the spike. But it seem fixed in 3.10.0 unless we are carrying a specific patch in Gentoo

If I set SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei2,AVX,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1 then I can also compile atlas-3.10.0 in about 10 minutes. The issue is only with the "generic" archdefs, which seem to be not sufficiently specialzied. I've raised this issue on the ATLAS mailinglist.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-15 03:32:20

The updated atlas spkg also installs a script `atlas-config` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` which can be used to compute new architectural defaults. I need somebody on Linux i386 to first install the new spkg and then run 

```
SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes atlas-config --archdef
```

to grind out the archdefs for the i386 "generic" target. I'm currently doing this for x86_64, but I don't have a i386 machine. This will use sudo to turn off CPU throttling so you need to be a sudoer.

```
[vbraun`@`volker-desktop sage-5.2.beta1]$ ./local/bin/atlas-config --help
usage: atlas-config [-h] [--unthrottle PID] [--archdef]

(Re-)Build ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net) according to the
SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH environment variable

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  --unthrottle PID  switch CPU throttling off until PID finishes
  --archdef         build archdef tarball and save it to the current directory
```

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-16 14:36:18

The new version d33e9114156d8373fa61f957b379e029 changes the "fast" 64-bit archdef to `P4E64SSE3`.

It turns out that there are no 64-bit generic archdefs, which might have been one reason for why ATLAS was slow to compile. The SPKG uses the existing 32-bit archdefs or the 64-bit one that I made. On x86 the spkg should produce a working ATLAS library within 10-30 mins, and only go through the tuning process if either
  * CPU throttling is disabled (`scaling_governor=performance`, needs root), or
  * SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH is explicitly set to something different from "base" / "fast".

Very cool. I just got ATLAS to build on my OS X 10.6.8 machine setting `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei2`. Running long tests now.

Update: ATLAS-3.10.0 built successfully on my OS X 10.6.8 machine with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei2`, the build took approx. 16 mins. The build log is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/atlas-3.10.0.log. Sage passes all `make ptestlong` tests. The spkg looks very good to me. I'd give this a positive review, but maybe it should be tested by a few other reviewers on other platforms first.

I've built it successfully on OS X 10.6.8 (with Core2 Duo) and setting `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH="base"`.

Well, there's at least room for nitpicking (a couple of typos and some inconsistencies as well as superfluous code in `spkg-install` and probably `configuration.py`, don't recall)...  I'll maybe take a look at it again tomorrow, and probably provide a patch (provided Volker doesn't plan to make further major changes to these files).




How about also installing a user script for convenience to save the built ATLAS libraries to another place (for later use with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB`)?

Regarding the mentioned excessive tuning times, I also wonder whether we should use something like `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` (or `base`) _by default_, i.e., only do self-tuning if the user explicitly asks for it in some way.  I guess the Sage Installation Guide needs to get updated anyway w.r.t. ATLAS and environment variables.

I don't know why it's not building, but it shouldn't exit saying "Successfully installed atlas-3.10.0". I added a print statement, and "rc" is 512. The [documentation for sys.exit](http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.exit) says that for the argument, "Most systems require it to be in the range 0-127, and produce undefined results otherwise." We could instead do this:

```diff

I noticed that libcblas.so is using rpath

```

And that's from outside the sage shell. However for f77blas and presumably lapack, libgfortran is not rpath-ed (I am using sage gcc's spkg in this case). 

That is important info if you want to put atlas libraries in another location.

I will run a few tests shortly.

Volker, do you still need architecture defaults for i386? I have access to an old laptop with a Centrino M processor that reports being i386 / i686 in `uname -a` and in /proc/cpuinfo:


```
cpu family 6
cpu model 13
Intel Pentium M
```


I haven't ever built Sage on it, I imagine it would take several years, but I'm willing to give it a try.

* John, I'm against changing the exit codes, we report whatever the sub-process spat out. So even if its >127, thats just what we were handed so clearly its a supported exit code.

  I don't have an account on hawk, but in any case that should not stop us from shipping an updated ATLAS that fixes build issues on modern hard/software. We can always clean up second-tier platforms later. But do post the whole log, the error is likely further up.

  * Leif, are you working on a patch? In `configure_fast()`, we should set 
    {{{
arch = 'P4E'
    }}}
    instead of `P4E64SSE3` is added later. This is what causes your build failure.

  * Francois: the weird messages are normal. The rpaths are set by libtools and are what libtools likes to set. As long as we set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` this doesn't matter except when we distribute the binaries. This needs to be fixed some day in all shared libs but not on this ticket.

  * Benjamin: no I don't need 32-bit archdefs, this should be covered by what ATLAS already ships with. The atlas spkg should build relatively quickly now except for the cases in [This is the Trac macro *comment:72* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:72-macro)

But after `sys.exit(512)`, Python has return code of zero, on sage.math, OS X, and OpenSolaris. So sage-spkg thinks the spkg installed correctly, which it clearly didn't. From the [documentation for os.system](http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.exit), it looks to me that its output should be divided by 512 to get a return code suitable for sys.exit, but I'm not sure about that. However you want to fix it, it has to be changed: it's not acceptable for the compilation to fail but for spkg-install to have a return code of zero.

Something along the following lines should be used to handle `rc`, see [http://docs.python.org/library/os.html](http://docs.python.org/library/os.html)

```
if os.WIFEXITED(rc):
    rc = os.WEXITSTATUS(rc)
elif os.WIFSIGNALED(rc):
    rc = 128 + os.WTERMSIG(rc)
else:
    raise SystemError("Unknown return value %i for os.system()"%rc)
```

I've investigated and reported the Solaris build issue upstream at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3545418&group_id=23725&atid=379483


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-18 14:49:07

The return value is actually the return value of `os.system()`, which is described in http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.wait

To extract the exit status, we should just do `sys.exit((rc >> 8) & 0x7f)`. Leif, are you working on the spkg right now?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-18 16:30:01

The workaround for the Solaris build issue is to use the fqn for `$CC` and `sage_fortran`


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-18 17:10:47

Since Leif apparently isn't around I implemented the fqn workaround for the Solaris build and the return status issues. Solaris build is still broken but now at a different place. Updated spkg at the same place, md5sum is `878695a26071cfe73a9977bd8413b748`.

---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-18 18:12:32

Sounds good! I updated the spkg with yet another SPARC Solaris fix, md5sum is `6dbcf22c920626380f2cba877cca4cb1`. Though still doesn't work on mark/skynet, but at least makes it now into the compile phase. In any case SPARC solaris issues shouldn't delay this ticket.

Using `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` in contrast worked (and `ptestlong` passed with Sage 5.2.rc0, FWIW):

Thats pretty good for 18W TDP. I take it compiling all of Sage takes 2+ hours on that machine?

Sure.  Although ATLAS currently consumes only <= 9W ;-)

Unfortunately ATLAS is built quite late (due to its odd dependency on *Sage's* Python -- while your script is apparently designed to support Python 2.4 as well), so a fair amount of the time spent building Sage only one core is used (because the remaining packages directly or indirectly depend on ATLAS).


I reinstalled the updated spkg again with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`:

Did you apply the root repo patch (to remove the BLAS and LAPACK spkgs)?

Oops, no, I forgot. One more time...


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-07-19 16:18:11

Now Sage doesn't build on hawk, I guess due to the problems noted on #10509: cvxopt doesn't build, because it says

```
ld: fatal: library -lblas: not found
```

I'll skip building cvxopt and continue with the rest of the build.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-19 16:29:38

I don't think the cvxopt problem is due to #10509. The cvxopt spkg explicitly links against `blas`,  this is bad. From the cvxopt `patches/setup.py.patch`:

```
+ libraries = ['m','lapack','gsl','blas','gslcblas','cblas','gfortran','atlas']
```

this is wrong, it should be `f77blas` if the Fortran version is actually used or not there at all. Of course all modern systems have a `libblas.so` somewhere so the linker finds it, notes that it is not used, and proceeds. Except that on Hawk, I guess, there is no system-wide `libblas`. We should proceed removing blas in this ticket and then fix cvxopt on second-tier platforms later.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-07-19 16:53:05

I meant that linking to blas was [noted at #10509](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10509#comment:7) as a possible problem, not that #10509 was causing this issue.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-19 16:57:25

You are right, that the patch on #10509 should have been applied to cvxopt a long time ago then it wouldn't break here.

ROFL, with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH="AMD64K10h,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1,3DNow"` (which involves self-tuning) it took

```
real	36m15.153s
user	31m23.290s
sys	5m56.960s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.0
```


Also a bit strange is that the timing for `ptestlong` (all for Sage 5.2.rc0, GCC 4.4.3) was

  `base` < `fast` < `AMD64K10h`

(i.e., fastest with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`), although I think at least during the last run the machine was partially loaded with other stuff as well, and clearly `ptestlong` isn't very appropriate to benchmark ATLAS performance... ;-)

[Not going to use the ATLAS tools for comparison right now, perhaps later...]

Another weird thing are (non-fatal w.r.t. the build) errors like

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-07-19 20:36:55

On hawk: with the appropriate patches applied, I still get some test failures, but as far as I can tell, they're all due to cvxopt being broken. So it looks pretty good.

Is it intentional that static libraries no longer get installed (although built)?

On cvxopt I am doing a new spkg in #13160 I'll check what I have done there. My main issue with the current spkg is it is horribly overlinked.

Upstream really only builds static libraries. But static libraries suck for our purposes. So yet, it is intentional that the static libraries are not installed.

Of course all modern systems have a `libblas.so` somewhere so the linker finds it, notes that it is not used, and proceeds. Except that on Hawk, I guess, there is no system-wide `libblas`. We should proceed removing blas in this ticket and then fix cvxopt on second-tier platforms later.


Perhaps this ticket should get #13160 as a dependence. One thing I checked is that it appears to work on OSX 10.6.8, both with native blas/lapack, and with Atlas 3.10 from this ticket. I imagine #13160 can get finalized quickly.

FWIW, while `make time` works, `make atlvat2.pdf ...` (to build ATLAS vs. ATLAS comparison charts) seems to be broken -- for me it always fails with a buffer overflow.

Well, as long as also the shared libraries are present, they're (usually) preferred over the static ones (i.e., unless one explicitly asks for linking against the latter), so copying these into `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/` IMHO shouldn't hurt.  (The static libraries are btw. needed to compare different ATLAS installations; the only way to "keep" them is to reinstall the ATLAS spkg with `./sage -f -s ...` or to set `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS`, and manually copy them.)  

Note that previously installed static ATLAS libraries currently don't get removed.  Don't know whether that may cause trouble (e.g. with upgrading); see above.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-07-21 19:16:49

Its true that it doesn't hurt to have the static libraries as long as you don't use them. This is like saying that a knife doesn't hurt until you are stabbed with it. True, but why put a sharp blade under the couch pillow in hopes that nobody will sit on it?

It would be nice to have some system to compare different atlas versions and compile runs, but thats definitely for another ticket. Ideally the `atlas-config` python script could save the atlas libraries in a private directory, for example by setting a special environment variable while building atlas. And then have some way to tabulate the performance of different installs.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-02 01:38:58

I think the only remaining blocker is that it (or rather, cvxopt) doesn't build on hawk. Since I don't have an account, can someone test it (the spkg + patches from this ticket + the cvxopt spkg from #13160)? Everything else in this ticket has been reviewed already, we just have to check that the interaction with cvxopt is fixed on the last "fully supported" platform.

Cvxopt still doesn't build. I see the same error when using the ATLAS spkg here or when setting `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/ATLAS32`. [Here is the log.](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.5.log)

Does the ATLAS spkg here build on skynet/mark (and Solaris on sparc in general)?

I'm still not happy with "discarding" the built static libraries; there should at least be some convenient way to save them (other than `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes` or installing with `sage (-i|-f) -s ...`.)

Another issue is the extremely increased build time on some machines if one doesn't set `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH`.  Don't know how we could handle that, but it certainly gives rise to a lot of user complaints.


---

Comment by leif created at 2012-08-02 13:40:28

P.S.:  W.r.t. the "knife":  If you don't want to install static libraries (_somewhere_), at least previous ones should get removed (or moved somewhere else) upon a _successful_ ATLAS build.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-02 14:33:07

Now that I added the generic 64-bit archdefs the default build time (without setting `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH`) should be moderate on all x86 systems. I.e. less CPU time than building the rest of Sage.

Your suggestions about handling the static libraries are enhancement requests. By itself, its useless to keep a backup of the static libraries somewhere. I agree that one should keep them around and devise a way to benchmark them, but not on this ticket. Also I'm against attempting to delete stuff from previous installs unless it actively conflicts with the new spkg. Which it does not, the damage of statically linking is already done.

I'd rather say not installing them [anywhere] is a regression w.r.t. the previous spkg.

If so, it shouldn't hurt to keep ATLAS installing them either... ;-)

[I'd expect "more damage" when having _different_ `.a` and `.so` library versions.]

Its a major improvement, not a regression!

> If so, it shouldn't hurt to keep ATLAS installing them either... ;-)

As I explained previously, thats not true. We have to change things to make them better. But we can't un-link the static linkage that has happened previously, so when you upgrade from an existing spkg you potentially keep the old code. And there is nothing a new atlas spkg can do about this. If you want to be sure that you don't have cruft statically linked you'll have to do a clean install. This is precisely why it was a bad idea to install static libraries previously.

I note that on OS X, the test suite doesn't run, even if ATLAS is built. This could perhaps be dealt with on a follow-up ticket? Maybe only skip self-tests if 

```
"$UNAME" = "Darwin" -a -z "$SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH"
```

or something like that?

More seriously, I'm having problems with this on the skynet machine iras. I'm building Sage from scratch, using the spkgs from this ticket and #13160. The ATLAS build started about 15 hours ago, and nothing has been written to the log file for at least 6 hours. I'm going to quit and restart the build...

Ouch.  How long did 3.8.4 take to build, and did you suspend the ECM background jobs? (They're back again...)

Presumably something to report upstream, but perhaps we can tweak it ourselves somehow.

Clint Whaley (ATLAS developer) doesn't have access to Itanium any more, so its not surprising that it does a full search. If its too slow for you then get yourself a new computer ;-) I'll have a look at the self-test issue, but it seems that the build/install works. Right?

Can't one use the current ATLAS spkg on Itaniums instead of the new one? Or there are incompatibility problems?

Itaniums are not a dying breed, at least AFAIK Intels still plans to release a new Itanium chip this year. So just hoping that they'd be gone soon is too optimistic. Should we try getting Clint Whaley access to an Itanium machine?

We can use a preinstalled ATLAS library on the buildbots. Given that this is by far the slowest part of the compile cycle, I think thats reasonable. We even do this officially on OSX where we always use the system-provided BLAS. But perhaps easier would be to update the Itanium archdef so that it doesn't have to tune. I just started a compile on iras, but don't expect the answer too soon ;-)

Well Intel made some unfortunate (for them) contractual commitments here... But ia64 is certainly not getting much love.

I've asked to that extend on the sage-skynet list.

It worked on 2 machines I tested, but failed on a PIII machine - it turns out that Atlas 3.10.0 does not work on PIII but the fix is simple - see http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#piiisse2 for confirmation.

You mean the (reproducible) segfaults on some AVX CPUs?  These can be solved by reinstalling the ATLAS spkg (one or two times) -- which doesn't take that long, as these CPUs are fast... ;-)

No, seriously, as a temporary "solution", we could at least put the old ATLAS, BLAS and LAPACK spkgs into the experimental branch, such that (e.g.) Itanium users can still access them (to be installed manually with `./sage -f ...` of course).




W.r.t. the "dead archictecture":  It's IMHO always good to test on a broad range of platforms, as that might expose real bugs that just incidentally don't show up on the "mainstream" (Intel, AMD, meanwhile perhaps also ARM); if one day GCC does no longer support Itanium, the situation will be different.

Therefore I was suggesting to also install some script to easily "save" the ATLAS libs somewhere for later use with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` (orthogonal to the static libraries issue).

I don't feel too strongly about it either way, but I would be a little surprised if Jeroen is willing to merge this if it takes so long to build on iras.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-09 00:04:20

Thats quite a speedup. I guess in your earlier test ATLAS failed to use the `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` build because of system load (first attempt), then tried `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` which is the old Itanium (not Itanium 2), which then did a full search for timings. Something like that must have happened, the compile is not just 30x faster without background jobs running. 

So I guess all problems are solved?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-08-09 01:02:16

Ah, no, I think you misunderstand: it's quite a slow-down. The shorter time (~1 hour) is for 3.8.4 without suspending background processes, the longer time (~37 hours) is for 3.10.0 with two background processes suspended.

Also, ATLAS failed to build on various Buildbot systems: arando (Linux i386), lena (Linux x86_64), cicero (Linux i386), iras (Linux ia64), hawk (OpenSolaris i386).

I just tried the build once, I will retry them.  But in any case, the build is more flaky than the previous version of ATLAS.

The OSX 10.4 issue is a cvxopt bug. Where is BLAS in the ancient vecLib and why didn't Apple call it libblas? In any case I don't have access to a museum Mac, so somebody else will have to figure that out.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-08-17 19:43:45

Technically if we want to use atlas on OS X a number of spkg including cvxopt needs to be updated. I am not sure I would call it a cvxopt bug because that's part of the configuration we introduced in spkg-install. Before the inclusion of this spkg cvxopt probably would have picked up libblas from the blas spkg.
We can fix this in cvxopt of course.

On the first try, this built successfully for me on iras, lena, and hawk. (I've built it at least twice on iras and hawk, with no failures.) On the other hand, cicero (Linux x86) and flavius (Linux x86_64) both fail to build, with essentially the same error. [Log file here.](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cicero-atlas-3.10.0.log) They also both took a long time (about 17 hours for cicero) trying to build the ATLAS spkg. I think we need some new different settings, because the build times for cicero, flavius (almost 19 hours), and iras (34.5 hours this time) are way too long.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-19 23:41:47

Oh I see, cicero/flavius have only a single CPU core. Talking about a blast from the past! In that case ATLAS doesn't build threaded static libraries, so we can't build threaded shared libraries. They are also so old that ATLAS can't figure out whether CPU throttling is enabled, so the full timings are collected instead of immediately falling back to a pre-defined archdef. Instead of trying to catch this in the ATLAS spkg and potentially not running the tuning in cases where we ought to, I think we should just configure the buildbot to set `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` on these ancient machines.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-08-20 03:00:49

I thought one of the purposes of the buildbot was to test that Sage builds "out of the box" on a variety of platforms, so tuning environment variables for use with the buildbot machines doesn't seem like the right solution. But maybe I'm not thinking about the buildbot the right way.

Also, supporting "ancient" machines is important: if we want mathematicians in underdeveloped countries, for example, to be able to use Sage, they may not have access to anything better.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-20 05:08:10

Well nobody stops you from tuning ATLAS for a day if you have an ancient computer. Its just annoying on the buildbot if you want to test something else than the ATLAS build. I guess the question is: Do we want, by default, to build a state-of-the-art BLAS library on all computers or only on sufficiently modern ones?

Is that a bug in ATLAS or a bug in `spkg-install`?  The version of ATLAS currently in Sage doesn't have this problem.

And I'm with John on trying the build "out of the box" on the buildbots as much as possible. And I don't consider single-core machines ancient.

well, 37 hours for a single package sounds like buildbot abuse. And I think that the default for slow machines with a single CPUs should be a basic Atlas install, with as little tuning as possible. There should be however be good documentation available on how to improve Atlas performance on a host, by rebuilding the spkg.

>And I don't consider single-core machines ancient.

One way or another, single-core machines do not need many features of the new Atlas. Perhaps it's time to think about versioning possibilities: a meta-package Atlas that installs an appropriate for the architecture version?

So if you are fine with waiting 2 days for the slower buildbots to complete then that settles it.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-08-20 18:20:18

Is there some sort of preliminary testing which could be done in spkg-install to try to catch machines which might take many hours to build ATLAS? For those machines, we could set the appropriate environment variable to skip as much tuning as possible, and then for quicker machines, we do more tuning. Something like

```sh
if [ -z "$SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH" && machine_is_too_old ]; then
   SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH='skip tuning' # or whatever
fi
```

(For 'machine_is_too_old', maybe just seeing if it only has one core would be enough.) Then the user can force tuning by setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH to something appropriate. I'm not sure this the the right variable, but anyway, I hope you understand the idea. Is this workable?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-21 02:47:42

The old machines are slow because they are old and because there are no up-to-date architectural defaults for ancient hardware. None of this can be fixed by a magic environment variable (except pointing `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` to the system atlas libraries). Basically, you can't skip tuning sparc just because you have i386 archdefs. There is a lot of assembler code that will be unhappy.

Also, I don't think there is an easy way to know that atlas would take a long time without actually building it. We could just install a reference blas on all non-starte-of-the-art machines (say, less than 4 cores and 2GHz). But this will be a major rewrite of how Sage builds its BLAS libraries.

It doesn't quite settle it, because the new spkg simply *fails to build* on some machines.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-21 16:03:41

I know, and I will make sure it builds on those machines. What I can't do is make ATLAS build **fast** on ancient hardware.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-08-22 09:58:06

I would like to know the answer to this question: do what extent are these issues upstream issues or issues with Sage?  Because the current ATLAS-3.8.4 works fine.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-22 17:44:25

The current ATLAS **does not work fine** for some modern CPUs (search the mailinglist for reports), nor does it have AVX support. Realistically, if you want to have a fast BLAS then you need to track upstream pretty closely since a lot of linear algebra performance boils down to having a good (asm) implementation tuned to your particular hardware.

The build failures that I have seen logs for were just bugs in the Sage buildscript that I'm working on fixing.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-24 11:33:02

The updated spkg fixes the issue with single-core processors. Builds fine on cicero.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-08-25 23:51:54

Builds on cicero and flavius. On mark (Solaris), I see a problem building scipy. Could this be related?  [Log here.](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/scipy-0.9.p1.log)

Edit: more info, from the numpy log:

Yes totally ATLAS related. May you could also post ATLAS's log or at least the end bit of it where it builds lapack.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-26 09:06:07

I've added archdefs for Itanium2, now build time is a lot faster:

```
vbraun`@`iras:~/opt/iras/sage-5.3.beta0> SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast ./sage -f http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.10.0.spkg
[...]
real    44m44.170s
user    41m47.156s
sys     2m42.456s
```

Though if you don't specify `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` it will still run, by default, a full tuning. If that fails for any reason it will try `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` next.

It's [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/atlas-3.10.0-mark.log).

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-08-26 23:30:33

I am not sure what happens at all. I am not convinced that the original lapack archive is getting relinked along with the C interface from ATLAS but that's not easy to establish from the log because of the size. I would need to spend some time looking at it carefully.

> The OSX 10.4 issue is a cvxopt bug. Where is BLAS in the ancient vecLib and why didn't Apple call it libblas? In any case I don't have access to a museum Mac, so somebody else will have to figure that out.
Reporting for duty!  Currently building MPIR, with with changes in this ticket (except the doctest/doc patch, which is no biggie).

Would this issue only come up if someone did set `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` or at any rate set it? I though that using the system ATLAS was still the default on Mac after this ticket - was that a misunderstanding?  I might find out before I leave work today... but if it doesn't break without resetting that variable, I don't think that is as bad, since hopefully no one using this old of a machine is depending on it for fast linear algebra.

That would be a start but most of the spkg using blas have specific rules for OS X and we would need to change them before they start using ATLAS instead of veclib. From the top of my head:
 * iml (actually that would solve some problems)
 * linbox
 * numpy
 * scipy
 * cvxopt
 * R?

I believe sage itself can cope with the change as is but it should be checked.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-08-28 03:48:51

My point was not that we should switch to ATLAS, but rather that it might be possible to have a different ticket for making ATLAS work optionally on Mac this way, if Sage builds and tests fine with this new ATLAS in the case where Mac does not actually build it.  I don't know if that's true, though, since jdemeyer's report could perhaps have been with that env var set.

Well, it turns out that it must be removing the other spkgs that does it.

Oh I take it your museum piece doesn't have a Power4 CPU. Can you try 

```
SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=PPCG4 sage -f http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.10.0.spkg
```

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-08-28 18:57:00

Correct, PowerPC G4, which I think is slightly different.  It's currently compiling fine, I'll let you know the results.

In other news, #13408 seems to be a dup of this ticket.  I don't know if we support "rhel 5" systems currently, nor whether this particular spkg fixes that person's problem, though.

Good as far as it goes!  Is this the record for longest ATLAS build ever?

Typing `make` after that still leads to the cvxopt `can't find file for -lblas` error; can someone remind me what the command would be to force rebuilding of dependencies (if that would even make a difference)?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-29 18:34:38

So all we have to do is build ATLAS on OSX 10.4, then we don't have to figure out how to drive the ancient accelerate framework. Dima, can you change cvxopt to link against atlas on 10.4?


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-08-29 18:41:26

I see, so that's why the problem is the same.  Sounds like either we would do this, or fbissey's idea of a different configuration now.

I've touched cvxopt and am trying to build the rest of Sage now, so don't hold your breath yet that this was a permanent fix (in addition to roughly doubling the build time of Sage, not that this would matter on this platform).


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-08-29 18:46:44

I've changed the spkg to build by default on PPC OSX machines (Darwin + `uname -p` equals `powerpc`).

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-08-30 13:32:56

Like I said, don't count those chickens.  I think this is pretty clearly related, given the libatlas reference.

I think that's the last spkg other than rubiks and sagetex, actually, so cvxopt and r might be the only problems with this approach.

so it won't even build doc, which is weird, since it _did_ say that Sage started properly.

The last two errors are really a misconfiguration/miscompilation of numpy. If you look at /Users/student/Desktop/sage-5.3.rc0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/linalg/lapack_lite.so with otool -L (I think) you may see something. In fact the deeper problem seem to be that the dynamic lookup doesn't find libatlas.dylib. I am not sure if explicit linking would solve the problem. We should look at the numpy spkg and also atyour numpy log to see how lapack_lite.so was linked.

For R it looks like a similar problem. R uses lapack and compile its own subset if not present. It also looks for ATLAS specific bits. Did you run otool from the sage shell? In this case I don't think it matters but you should look at those library problem from a sage shell to get the right LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings.

OK that's weird. According to your log of building numpy, lapack_lite.so was compiled against veclib rather than atlas and this is in accord with your otool output. So the problem may steem from a relinking or hiding of the veclib library by atlas. It is probably finding the symbols in the ATLAS install first.
The problem in turn seems to be that libatlas.2.dylib is missing a symbol or that it should be provided by an extra library not provided. otool -L -r on libatlas.2.dylib? (I hope the -r does what I except: same thing as -r in ldd in linux), actually on lapack_lite.so while you are at it.

I'm not sure that was what you wanted.

It's not. I am not sure there is an otool equivalent for "ldd -r". Another point: from the error you get I am expecting that if you start python from the sage shell and then "import numpy" if will fail with a similar error. Starting python with "-v" may show us what libraries get loaded exactly when you import numpy.

According to the man page for ldd, that option only works on ELF binaries (whatever that means), and [this blog post](http://0xfe.blogspot.com/2006/03/how-os-x-executes-applications.html) confirms that Mac doesn't use them.  [This other blog post](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/36014-ars-technica-on-dp-4.html) suggests that dyld might be useful...

Numpy results coming up.

Hi,

now that I re-read the comments here again, I seem to faintly remember this problem circle from my adventure with lmonade (Gentoo Prefix derivative) on OS X 10.4 last year. See my travel account about this, points "22." and "26." and especially the rant following that in:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lmnd-devel/1ZqHx1JBY2Q/syAOZYtZN4IJ

1. If my memory is correct, the symbol "_ATL_DecAtomicCount" comes from/is resolved in libblas(.dylib), this could be checked independently from the underlying OS. Where is libblas.dylib (libblas.so under Linux) located, is it something like .../lib/blas/reference/?

2. Karl-Dieter, I try to catch up with what you installed and tried, but till then could you please try

"sage -R"

anyway in the meantime (from the shell prompt) and print the result, probably an error message from the OS X 10.4 less-than-optimal dyld dynamic loader?

3. If this really is what the problem is about, some symlinks might suffice, but I do not remember exactly how and for which libraries (both R and maxima were affected in a weird way, and Volker's compilerwrapper intervenes in the lmonade setting, too). 

Best regards,

Georg


P.S.:
Later last year, I ultimately managed somehow to get some 64-bit Sage (lmonade flavour) working on the 32-bit OS X 10.4, so in the course, I definitely had to successfully build and link/reference some new "self-made" 64-bit atlas/blas, since OS X 10.4 only ships with a 32-bit "system copy" of atlas/blas, so this is definitely doable. But even Python itself is not officially supported as 64-bit version on OS X 10.4, so quite some more hackery was needed. (This only might be interesting, if one day the Sage project wants to get rid of the dependency of certain Apple system library headers, which come only with "XCode", or more precisely the "command line tools", on newer OS X versions --- currently these are a prerequisite for building Sage on OS X.)

Yeah I remember those bits vaguely now. But lmnd never used libvec unless you hacked something (I have an ebuild to allow that but no-one else has seen it). The location you mention in (1) is specific to gentoo and correspond to netlib blas (otherwise called blas reference) current lmnd uses a different scheme. A lmnd user could pick openblas or gotoblas these days.

The link idea is interesting, having $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libblas.dylib pointing to libvec could help.

```
(sage-sh) student`@`Dasher-03:sage-5.3.rc0$ ./sage -R
/Users/student/Desktop/sage-5.3.rc0/spkg/bin/sage: line 496: /Users/student/Desktop/sage-5.3.rc0/local/bin/R: No such file or directory
```

But that's expected, since I didn't succeed in building R with this.

With OS X 10.4 on my MacIntel, I ran with sage-5.3.rc1 into the same problem as earlier reported here (for Sage-5.2 and Sage-5.1, I can confirm the problem exists already for Sage-5.1):


https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/sage-devel/5.1$205.2/sage-devel/0T4djTzK0BE/4d7dnBJq9YQJ


The fix is trivial (once one knows what the problem is), in module_list.py there is a "-lpari" option missing for the cremona.mat module (for the other cremona.xxx modules, the "-lpari" option is listed with a comment about "Cygiwn might need this" --- obviously the dynamic linker/loader on OS X 10.4 MacIntel is comparably dumb). Once I sorted out creating a corresponding ticket, uploaded the fix there, and answered to the thread above, I'll continue with the atlas story here.

Hi all,
it is really puzzling, why with current Sage-5.3 on OS X 10.4 PPC (yesterday released, it's up on the servers), the cvxopt-1.1.5 spkg finds during its build the blas.dylib --- but with the changes of this ticket here, cvxopt-1.1.5 does not find it anymore (see comments #142 and #170 here).

Some facts:

 - On OS X 10.4 PPC, under the directory "/usr/lib/", there are no "atlas.dylib", "blas.dylib", "cblas.dylib", "lapack.dylib" files or links (on OS X 10.4 Intel, these four entries *do* exist there, as links).
 - On OS X 10.4 (both PPC and Intel), Sage historically does not build atlas nor blas (nor cblas) nor lapack, so there are not corresponding dylibs either under "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/".
 - In $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/module_list.py, there is some magic for the configuration of the "BLAS" and "BLAS2" macros. Given the above fact(s), on OS X 10.4 PPC, I read these as resulting to use "gslblas" (!!) provided by Sage, on OS X 10.4 Intel, I read these as resulting to use the system "cblas" and "atlas".
 - On OS X 10.4 Intel, these "system" atlas, blas, and cblas libraries actually all link to one and the same "blas.dylib" located under /System/Libraries/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/version/A/vecLIB.framwork/version/A/ (or some permutation thereof, I can't look up the exact path right now at the moment). These libraries are also located there under OS X 10.4 PPC, but there do not seem to be any links.
 - The old cvxopt-1.1.4(.p1) lists "gslblas" as library to be linked to, but actually, it is unclear at least to me, which kind of "blas" library really got used in the end on OS X 10.4 --- maybe on PPC some different one than on Intel.

Is it possible that currently, the build of cvxopt-1.1.5 on OS X 10.4 PPC succeeds only during a "whole" build of Sagte-5.3, the linker somehow caching the libraries it finds in the course of the build (especially "blas.dylib" somewhen before cvxopt is built) --- and with the changes of this ticket, the build sequence changes somehow so suddenly, "blas.dylib" is not anymore in this cache (or whatever kind of mechansim with the same result)?

Before this ticket netlib's blas (blas spkg) would be build on OS X if I am not mistaken. So an unoptimized blas would be present to be picked in SAGE_LOCAL/lib. cblas would indeed be provided by gslblas if nothing else.

hmm, no, I think on OSX there is native blas/lapack (veclib) which was used (and still is used, given the right settings used to build Sage).

I agree with Francois, we probably never used the ancient accelerate (OSX 10.4) framework correctly. In fact, this ticket makes it pretty clear that we did not.

as far as CVXOPT is concerned, it does use MacOSX veclib (there was a OSX 10.7-related ticket which dealt with the fact that veclib changed some undefined behaviour when 10.7 was released, and CVXOPT got hit by this issue).

Are you sure? I think OSX 10.4 is rather different from modern OSX accelerate. Post the output of `otool -L` on OSX 10.4 PPC or it didn't happen ;)

Tell me the _exact_ command (`otool -L what_file?`) and I'll do it as soon as I get to work.

So who was right?

```
Dasher-03:~/Desktop/sage-4.8/local/lib/python/site-packages/cvxopt student$ otool -L lapack.so 
lapack.so:
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.12)
        /Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.8/local/lib/libgsl.0.dylib (compatibility version 17.0.0, current version 17.0.0)
        /Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.8/local/lib/libgslcblas.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
```

This is with Sage 4.8, the last working binary I have on this box.  I foolishly deleted all newer ones in the meantime.  Sage 5.3 works on it, of course - in fact, I just used the app bundle yesterday - but it would take some time to start a fresh 5.3 or 5.4.beta0.

looks like this particular system does not use the veclib framework.  Is it Intel, or PPC?

At 700 MHz and half a gig of ram, probably one of the lowest-capability machines running Sage today... but it works fine, if slow.  But we're just spoiled - I'm sure Gauss or Newton would have been happy to have this :)

It is not necessary to "start a fresh 5.3 or 5.4.beta0". Instead, one can go to some Sage OS X PPC download page, http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/sagemath/sage-mirror/osx/powerpc/index.html , download from there e.g. "sage-5.3-OSX-32bit-10.4-PowerMacintosh-Darwin.dmg", and look inside --- on any OS X system/version. The result is ... surprising, to say the least:

```

        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.12)
```

The two occurences of "libgcc_s.1.dylib" are somewhat fishy, but apparently nothing new, and I'd vote for that topic being a complete different story, and not to be treated here any further. The library "libSystem.B.dylib" is the C runtime on OS X, AFAIK. But then only libfortran.dylib --- and no trace whatsoever of any *las.dylib?!?!? For comparison, on OS X 10.4 Intel, for Sage-5.3.rc1 the analoguous result is:

```
sagebuilder$ otool -L lapack.so
lapack.so:
        /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libLAPACK.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 192.15.0)
        /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 192.15.0)
        /Users/Shared/sage/sage-5.3.rc1/local/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /Users/Shared/sage/sage-5.3.rc1/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.3.11)
```

I would conclude that it is problematic, that the OS X 10.4 PPC linker/loader builds at all the current cvxopt-1.1.5 spkg contained in Sage-5.3, producing results with such incomplete dependency information. Looking closely on the command line, it is told to use "-undefined dynamic_lookup" (which seems to save us at runtime later, however only by chance, I guess), so essentially it does what it should --- but then, why does that linker/loader under some very comparable circumstances error out with "/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lblas"???

Of the different alternatives to come to an end with this ticket here (which is about the new atlas-3.10 spkg), I like the "link idea" (see the comment 191 from Francois), i.e. the atlas spkg, generally on OS X (!), doing no more and no less than creating links in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ --- the same as exist in /usr/lib/, at least on OS X 10.4 Intel. More precisely, three links pointing to the "framework" blas library:

```
libatlas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
libblas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
libcblas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
```

and one more link for the "framework" lapack library (all link targets being absolute, not relative):

```
liblapack.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libLAPACK.dylib
```

A quick check shows that at least on OS X Intel, the absolute path to these framework libraries is the same for OS X 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7 (I can't check for OS X 10.8), and even on OS X 10.7.3, there still is only one version "A", which is the "Current" version of that framework.

This change, for all OS X variants, would be a bit intrusive. But to me, it seems to bring the OS X world a bit closer to the situation on the other OSes. I offer to test a respectively updated atlas spkg on the OS X systems/versions I have access to. (In the "patches" subdir, one also might wish to delete the "edit" duplicates of two files, those with a tilde at the end of their file name.)

Thoughts?

I can't pretend to understand exactly what all the linking is doing here - it seems very much a black box.  But those two absolute paths certainly exist on my box, and seem like a good alternative to trying to get ATLAS to build from scratch on OS X for now.  I will naturally also volunteer to test on anything I have access to.

So you mean that after

        and not os.environ.has_key('SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH'):
    print 'Skipping build of ATLAS on intel OS X'
    sys.exit(0)


```

in the spkg-install (well, before the exit) we should add the linking described comment:205?  That would seem easy enough, though I don't know what the syntax would be (not just `ln`, I assume).

I don't think we should be symlinking system libraries into local/lib if we can avoid it. Really cvxopt is broken, it should be linking against the accelerate blas but doesn't. In particular, we should correctly set `BLAS_LIB_DIR` in cvxopt on Darwin. The update spkg fixes this. I've also changed the atlas spkg back to not build by default on Darwin. Please test the combination of both spkgs on your OSX machines.

With Sage 5.4.beta1:

```

This is because of 

```
# Lapack depends on SAGE_ROOT_REPO because it *executes* Fortran code at
# build time.  Therefore, it needs an up-to-date version of sage-env
# which adds $SAGE_LOCAL/lib64 to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
```

which if I recall correctly is from #13395, so this would need to be updated.  For now it won't affect me building from source, so I'll just do this by hand, but I don't know the right solution to combining those two things.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-09-13 17:13:17

Here's one more issue - I have a feeling this isn't OS X specific ;-)

```
File "/Users/.../sage-5.4.beta1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/package.py", line 119:
    sage: install_package()
Expected:

<snip>
```

This was a change in #11021, apparently introduced in beta0.  This was on 10.7; the build will not finish for quite a while on 10.4.

Interestingly, I didn't need to apply the doctest patch, so I guess that is only in certain hardware-specific circumstances.

Is it ok that there is basically an spkg in an spkg?  We just got rid of this in the R/RPy situation, but I assume this is somehow different.  Somehow.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-13 17:47:58

The new atlas needs the lapack tarball to build. The only alternative would be to have a separate lapack spkg that saves a tarball of its sources somewhere ;-)

it does build OK on MacOSX 10.5 PPC (namely, a G4 processor).

It's not done, but the failures all seem to be of the following sort - not finding `-lblas`:

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-09-17 17:53:44

This seems to work fine.  I think that if just putting this link in the top for only PPC machines (or even only 10.4 PPC machines if Dima's tests turn out fine) would be fine.  Or even some of the other links e.g. to lapack, if appropriate.

I also feel your frustration with not having an easy machine to test with.  I would really like to make this one available, but the way I understand it that's not an option - at least, I tried the ssh method above and it didn't seem to work properly.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-17 18:52:20

I've updated the spkg to symlink the veclib blas and lapack to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/` on OSX PPC. This should finally work now. Please test and review!

Karl-Dieter, you went beyond your duty to debug this. But every platform dies eventually, you just have to notice the signs. E.g. when it starts getting more difficult than finding a SPARC box ;)


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2012-09-17 19:05:08

Haha! Anyway, I'll still try it out.

By the way, I presume the cvxopt changes might not be necessary (at least not the Accelerate-related one) now, but that it also wouldn't hurt to keep them in for all Macs?


---

Comment by GeorgSWeber created at 2012-09-17 20:10:18

I ran also into the problem of comment 211, but I see that one is already cared for.

The latest "pyx_preparse()" problem might not be entirely due to what is done about "BLAS configuration/setup", and how it is done in .../sage/misc/cython.py (see especially lines 64-67 in conjunction with lines 78-79 and line 265 in that file), but certainly creates pretty exactly the kind of problem observed in comment 216, and healed by the symlink in comment 218. (It's quite a miracle to me, how that could have ever worked before under OS X 10.4 PPC --- which I know it did!)

Which leaves us with either adjusting every occurence of BLAS configuration/setup (sage/module_list.py lines 22-44, sage/misc/cython.py lines as above, cvxopt and possibly yet another spkg or two, ...) for the "OS X 10.4 PPC case" (we already *do* search for "/usr/lib/libclas.{so, dylib}" in those places, and use that one if one can be found there, just extend the search to "/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib" in case the former search failed), or else try the symlink approach. Or some "hybrid" approach, symlinking only on OS X 10.4 PPC.

`@`Volker:

In comment 209 you wrote:

> I don't think we should be symlinking system libraries into local/lib if we can avoid it.

So if you think that creating symlinks to "outside-of-sage" libraries in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/ (and possibly to header files like "cblas.h" and "clapack.h" in $SAGE_ROOT/local/include/, too) should be avoided, could you please give some insights about the reasoning behind?

P.S.:

I can't find the following note about trying to actually *build and use* ATLAS on OS X in the comments so far, so here it is: If we want to be able to do so one day, at least the numpy build system needs to be patched (somewhere in src/numpy/distutils/system_info.py, classes "lapack_opt_info" and "blas_opt_info"), since there the usage of the Accelerate framework on OS X is hardcoded --- which seems to be problematic, if other parts of Sage do not use the same underlying LAPACK and BLAS libraries. Essentially, one should be able to "just" re-use patches from the respective Gentoo ebuilds, it has the air of a "reine Fleissarbeit" (dict.leo.org: "a diligent but routine piece of work"). Of course, any OS X 10.4 PPC specific bits and pieces would then have to "behave well", too ... (the "symlinking approach" would probably make that part rather straightforward).

P.P.S.:

Now that quite a few people are involved, wouldn't it make sense to try to clean up that current BLAS configuration/setup code parts a bit? At least between module_list.py, cython.py and the cvxopt spkg install, more or less the same functionality is tripled. Possibly by moving all this to setting (or taking over from the parent environment) "SAGE_BLAS_LIB", "SAGE_CBLAS_LIB", "SAGE_ATLAS_LIB" or the like environment variables, ensuring these are sanely set at both the start of a Sage build (prereq spkg?!), as well as in the Sage environment at runtime (sage-shell?!), and then in "module_list.py", "misc/cython.py", cvxopt spkg install, ... simply referring to/using/relying on these env vars ... just letting the thoughts flow, sorry :-)

P.P.P.S.:

Unfortunately, it took me so long to write this, that it this message already mostly outdated (by comments 221, 222).


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-17 20:28:24

While ugly, its not really a problem if some parts of the Sage install link to alternative blas implementations. Though for now I think we'll just do the symlink workaround for OSX PPC. 

I'm totally against new environment variables. The proper solution IMHO is a `blas-config` script that can spit out the required options. For example, `blas-config --cflags --f77blas` would give you the f77 compiler flags. Then we can step by step replace all hardcoded blas guesses by `blas-config` calls. But this is stuff for a future ticket ;-)

all tests pass, no problem, without any workarounds needed for 10.4. Thus 10.5 behaves quite well.

It must have been some kind of weird race condition - I did another build from scratch on 5.4.beta1 on 10.7 with these changes and only had the expected misc/package.py error taken care of by the attached patch.  Sorry for the noise, and I'm certainly not going to try to track down the race condition.

Anyway, things are looking good!

Am I now?  There are tons of things on this ticket I know absolutely nothing about.  Was this the last outstanding issue, according to the other reviewers?  Will this last change cause trouble on computers other than the ones I tested it on?  (I'm taking it from Georg's word that that is indeed the relevant path for those libraries on all Macs, possibly not including Mountain Lion.)

Well we either wait until this ticket is obsoleted by the next ATLAS version, test it manually on each computer on skynet, or we let the buildbot do it.

Fair enough.  I was mainly worried about Dima's computer, actually.  So you're saying the rest of the ticket has already been positively reviewed?  For instance, in comment:162, John says "On mark (Solaris), I see a problem building scipy." and I don't see anything resolving that (in fact, he edits it to indicate ATLAS is the problem).  I am comfortable with positive review from my p.o.v., but I won't incur the wrath of Solaris fans by overriding that.

Sparc solaris isn't first-tier platform so we can always clean that up later. There is already way too much on this ticket to even pick out the comments that relate to SPARC only. And dima just reported that it worked fine for him.

Be it on your head, then!  Jeroen, send all buildbot log failures to Volker directly ;)

Also, Dima reported it worked fine _before_ the change to linking the system library directly in, though presumably if my computers on either end worked, his should.

Hah!  I should have known... The symlink by hand worked, but

```
Skipping build of ATLAS on intel OS X
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./spkg-install", line 106, in <module>
    ln(os.path.join(veclib_dir, lib),

sys     0m0.501s
************************************************************************
Error installing package atlas-3.10.0
************************************************************************
```

That's probably because this is `#!/usr/bin/env python`.  I think what we need is Python's `os.symlink`.  I can't explain why this doesn't raise a problem on 10.7, but apparently on 10.4 it does.

I've uploaded a package at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/atlas-3.10.0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/atlas-3.10.0.spkg) for Volker to look at.  Hopefully this will solve this last minor problem.  Then he can either put this change in his or link to this one if he feels it's now positive review.

It didn't cause trouble on my other machine because it is Intel, which doesn't use this branch of the code!  But it would have broken Dima's 10.5 PPC machine.

I thought you had tried the spkg on your machine ;-)

I fixed the ln (which is actually a python function that I forgot to import). The replaced spkg should work now. And the ln is only used on OSX PPC, which is also why I can't test it myself.

Ok.  I might be able to try this with my home box in a bit, otherwise it'll have to wait for the last test.  But that `ln` looks like a good one too.

Is the ATLAS spkg mentioned in the description still the correct link?

There is still a problem because the new atlas package runs `automake` and `autoconf`, probably some timestamps are messed up:

It looks like somebody copied the atlas tree on 11 July without `-p` option, therefore destroying all timestamps.

Conjecture: this happens on all Intel i386 32-bit systems.

The error on arando and hawk is with the `xextract.c` program, which is over 3000 lines of string-handling code in C.  There seems to be some heap corruption, so I'm pretty sure it's a genuine bug in ATLAS.

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-20 14:14:40

I agree, seems to be triggered by the very long path names in the buildbot. I'll try to narrow it down.

Not sure, I tried to increase all fixed-sized buffers in `xextract.c` and that didn't solve the problem.

I'd look for an error caused by the fact that arando has a 64-bit capable CPU, but runs a 32-bit kernel.

If it's about the path lengths then it should be possible to do a standalone install of Sage on arando in /tmp, say, and see whether the new Atlas works.

I haven't been able to reproduce this on `sage.math` in 32-bit mode.

I doubt that filenames have anything to do with it.

well, it's a different, older, CPU, isn't it?

Are you sure it got stuck? [comment:129 When I built on iras] (admittedly with an earlier version of the spkg), it would stop for hours at a time, but eventually continue. It ended up taking about 37 hours to complete.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-23 15:53:56

I think the occasional nap times are when ATLAS is trying to find the compiler etc by walking various directory trees. Except that skynet has such a slow NFS that this literally takes hours. Of course you can always attach strace to the process to see what it is really doing.

If this is true, it should be fixed.  That isn't a proper way to find a compiler.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-09-23 16:11:06

Can we force ATLAS to use the value of the `$CC` environment variable for the C compiler and skip the crazy `find` stuff?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-23 16:48:13

I'm passing the fqn of the compiler, this should make ATLAS not use find. Though it might do something similar for another binary. The only way to tell is to attach strace when it appears  stuck. I've started a compilation on iras...


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-09-25 11:01:57

I've built ATLAS on iras and it completed successfully. Just took two days or so. At times it gets quiet for a few hours while computing some timings but it did not get stuck.

Concerning iras: it does indeed build properly.  I actually wrote a small script to take snapshots of the ATLAS log file and noticed that the build seemingly gets stuck for almost 19 hours!

I still agree with the positive_review, even though this is a substantial regression in ATLAS build time.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-10-12 13:48:19

Of course you can always set `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` if you are in a hurry, then it won't attempt to go through the tuning process. On the other hand there isn't anything else for the buildbot to do on iras so do we care?

Log of compilation of atlas-3.10.0.p1 with SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=ARMv7 in a qemu vm

As seen in the two attached log files, I didn't manage to get that spkg to compile for ARMv7. No 'fast' or 'base' for these processors... so it doesn't work on arm!


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-22 13:02:18

The qemu failure is because of hard/soft abi mix (/usr/bin/ld: error: xctest uses VFP register arguments, /tmp/ccZXPvWa.o does not). It seems that something wrong with gcc/gfortran here.

On the native box, did you try `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=ARMv7,NEON`? Assuming that it has NEON support? It seems that the configuration dies because it doesn't deal with the case of no ISA extension.

That falls back on 'fast', which doesn't make sence for this processor!?

---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-22 14:05:35

The "base" and "fast" targets are my invention. Of course they are only implemented when I know a working configuration ;-)

At least the `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=ARMv7,NEON` version seems to get a little bit further. But it fails to detect the clock rate and then dies: "Clock rate configured as 0Mhz"

Replying to [comment:285 Snark]:

Atlas is the only BLAS implementation around that does tuning on the fly, AFAIK. Why is this needed for the vast majority of users, it's unclear. And Atlas is mostly a 1-man project. 

I'd say that ideally Sage should accept any (sufficiently compatible) BLAS/LAPACK implementation.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2012-12-22 18:45:50

Would it make sense to special case ia64 machines like iras, and just build the old ATLAS (and then would we also need lapack and blas)? It would increase the size of the spkg considerably to include the old and new versions, but disk space is cheap. If the new version is much better on most platforms, it might be worth it.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-22 18:46:45

Using the reference BLAS, say, will be an order of magnitude slower. Its not an option if you want to rival the big M's. Maple for Unix uses (or at least used) ATLAS.

Intel MKL or !Goto/Openblas are faster on the latest Intel chips. ATLAS is the only high-performance library that works at least somewhat across a larger range of processors.

I agree that Sage should be able to work with more than one BLAS/LAPACK. I'm looking into this now and will post to sage-devel with a concrete proposal.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-12-22 20:27:06

It is doable in that we do it in sage on gentoo. Iml needs patching too work with anything else than atlas (configuration not functionality) . Linbox numpy scipy need careful handling sage itself needs patching in setup.py as well. I know you are looking at lmnd Volker I guess that will give you an idea of what we do. Of course the pkgconfig and alternatives thing could be way simplified in vanilla sage.


---

Comment by Snark created at 2012-12-23 07:16:39

I have tried the upstream atlas sources, failed, and opened a bug report there -- the developer already answered.

Comment by jpflori created at 2012-12-31 09:49:59

Just a few random remarks:
* there is an updated cvxopt spkg at #13799 (it has been merged, so we need rebasing here), it seems to me it at least addresses the same kind of underlinking issue after the too aggressive fixes of #13160, but on Cygwin rather than OS X (I've not read all the comments in detail so excuse me if this is wrong),
* I don't think building ATLAS really needs to be disabled on Cygwin, I could at least build the static libraries for ATLAS 3.8.4 (although the shared make target would fail), not sure about ATLAS 3.10, it failed during tuning on my computer, but that's because of memory leaks unrelated to ATLAS, using SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH I should be able to get through this, at least get static libs, and see what's up with the shared ones. My feeling is that his should be postponed in a later ticket (unless this one never gets merged).
* If the only blocker is some obscure bug on ia64, why not merge it anyway and mention somewhere visible that we are aware of the failure? Or disable building ATLAS on ia64? Wouldn't it be better than using an unsupported version of ATLAS?

What is blocking this ticket anyway? Is it only the ia64 problem? I think it a bad idea that all current/common archs are blocked because of a failure in some arch that not many people are using. I have been patching and installing these patches on my machine for 3 months now because the older atlas refuses to build successfully.

Let's jsut request a system-wide atlas on ia64.
We do that on Mac OS X that a bunch of people actually use, they perfectly live with this, and it does not prevent us from updating Sage.

Most spkg using blas/lapack have a special section to deal with OS X. This spkg would mean we can actually switch to ATLAS on OS X and most of the spkg in question will have to be touched. So in fact we don't ask for anything to be set on OS X, it finds the vectorize framework all by itself.

I don't really get your answer.

To make my point more clear, can't we ask the user to install "something" that would replace what the atlas spkg provides on ia64, just as on Cygwin if you prefer, rather than on OS X where it is more tricky.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-26 20:24:38

Ah, I see. You want to add specific logic for ia64 in this spkg. Why not? I think you should just go ahead and add it (baring that, at least tell us how you want it implemented).

Updated ATLAS and LAPACK at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg
and a properly rebased cvxopt at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p1.spkg

Maybe the following change helps on ia64:

```
   * Fixed premature KillAllMMNodes in emit_mm.c
```

Some random strings look like the bug report at http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/863/ :)

Could someone test it on the previously failing (and working) archs?

At least it builds on a Corei7 with SAGE_ATLAS_aRCH=Corei2,AVX,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1
Ill try a proper Sage build later.

I should also have access to some armv7l and ia64 on GCC Compile Farm and will try to build 5.7 + patches here there.

On Solaris (skynet machine mark), I see the same problem as reported in [comment:162]. On ia64 (skynet machine iras), things don't look good: the ATLAS spkg has been building for at least 4 hours, and is currently stalled -- no changes to the install log in about 3 1/2 hours. This is what happened [comment:129 before], when it took 37 hours to build the spkg. I'll check back in a day or two to see if it's finished, but I think the upgrade from 3.10.0 to 3.10.1 didn't fix the problem.

The problem is that some ATLAS kernel crashes no ia64, not the long build time.

There are some *.tar.bz2 files in the patch directory, are they used anywhere?
I can't spot anything in our scripts.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-02-27 15:59:01

Im aware of what's said in the ticket description, but could you precise why we do not use upstream build system to generate the shared libraries, but rather repack the static ones?
After looking at
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/node22.html
which is not that crystal clear and at the Makefile used upstream it seems that more or less one big (sequential or parallel/ including fortran or not) library is built, and not 3 or 4 separate ones.
Is that correct?

About the Itanium build, after a previous modification at 12:45, the log was modified again at 16:50 :)

Keep us informed... `#sagemath` on `irc.freenode.net`

Or does ATLAS have a feature to tweet its build progress?  (I guess many Sage users would like that.)

Upstream has just completely changed the shared library names, so we would have to change all spkgs to hardcode different libatlas names. Instead I'd rather change Sage to use a pkgconfig-style script to get the blas/lapack libraries.

Could you please state from what to what as I couldn't determine that easily by just looking around on my computer?
And I can't use my computer to build different ATLAS version just for fun, so if its in the corner of you head, that would be greatly appreciated.
>Instead I'd rather change Sage to use a pkgconfig-style script to get the blas/lapack libraries. 
If that could also let other BLAS/LAPACK implementations be plugged into Sage, that would be really great.
I remember some discussion on sage-devel recently, but the proposed solution looked quite more complicated, don't remmeber why.

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-02-27 20:24:56

Its not just a name change for libraries, its also a change of which symbols are where. So basically you'll have to trial-build your way through all spkgs to see what you need to link in. Let me know when you are finished ;-)

The tar.bz files are architectural defaults, they are used by the atlas build system if you copy then into the right place.

I got their potential use, but are they actually used by the spkg scripts?
That's what I did not get.
I could not find any doc either about them.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-02-27 20:30:23

Except for

```
# add extra architectural defaults
# currently none
# cp('patches/ARCH.tgz', 'src/CONFIG/ARCHS')
```

Ok, I took the time to actually rebuild ATLAS 3.10.1 and do as advertised at:
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/node22.html
and there is indeed just one serial/parallel shared library built now called libatlas.so/libtatlas.so which contains all of libcblas.a libf77blas.a libatlas.a liblapack.a (or pt version of them).
Its also possible to rule out the fortran symbols.

I don't know what ATLAS 3.8.4 offered if it did offer anything for shared libraries.

Anyway, Im happy with your autotools script which basically do the same thing as upstream but in separate libraries.

Next sign of activity around 00:32, then somehow regularly until 2:19, and nothing since.
I hope it won't take more than 48 hours...

Some activity (I really mean writing into the log) between 14:14 and 14:20, not finished yet.

The build on iras finished after 36 hours, apparently successfully. We'll see how doctests go.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2013-02-28 21:08:21

On iras, I get several doctest failures:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/interpolators.pyx # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx # Killed/crashed
```

In the log file, it just says "The doctested process was killed by signal 11" for each one.

Oh and ATLAS finished at 2:02.
So that must be about 38/40 hours.

Please note the PARI/GP problem is completely unrelated, and the Linbox surely is.

Got it, the fix used defines something if using GCC 4.4.5 on non x86_64 because its needed on 32 bits.
Unfortunately this breaks ia64 (maybe other 64 bits systems? anybody wants to try out GCC 4.4.5 on sparc64 or ppc64 :)), so the problem it the filtering on "non x86_64", rather than "32 bits".

I cannot use the fast target on ia64 because the python module "platform" seems broken:

```
>>> platform.uname()
('Linux', 'tic', '2.6.32-5-mckinley', '#1 SMP Sun May 6 08:36:37 UTC 2012', 'ia64', '')
```

so that

```
>>> platform.processor()
''
```

Indeed

```
% uname -a
Linux tic 2.6.32-5-mckinley #1 SMP Sun May 6 08:36:37 UTC 2012 ia64 GNU/Linux
```

and

```
% uname -p
unknown
```

That's where the ia64 comes from.
Both "uname -p" and "uname -i" spit "unknown".

FYI, I tried building ATLAS on another similar ia64 (gcc66) with SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=IA64Itan2 and it still took ages:

```
real    2778m46.611s
user    2184m3.292s
sys     13m49.536s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.1.p0
```

and its quite similar to what happened without SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH set (and fast does not work, but I assume it would be the same as IA64Itan2):

```
real    2269m37.705s
user    2230m5.724s
sys     14m31.728s
```


Maybe that's because the other core is busy?
(can't do nothing about that...)

Result of make testlong on gcc60 at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/testlong-gcc63-ia64-debian.log

Most failures from gap seem to be of type

```
gap(22997): unaligned access to 0x60000fffffffa46f, ip=0x40000000001a7ba0
```

The one from gfan with assertions failures surely due to similar reasons.
It reminds me of #13151.

Some other failures involve permutation and symmetric stuff.

In particular I got no segfault in sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx.

After copying the tar.bz2 archdefs files in the patches directory into the src/CONFIG/ARCHS I indeed get a much faster (something between 40 minutes and 1 hour) build, so I guess you put them there in that intention and we should trigger the copy in spkg-install.

I'll put an updated spkg with that and a fix for detection of ia64 online soon.

It seems the spkg also takes a quite huge amount of time to build on sparc64 in 32 bits mode.

Did it segfault as before during "make ptest"?
I guess it was one of the main reason to withhold this package, so it would be great to know.
At least on the setup I used, there was no problem.

I get similar problems on sparc hardware.
There must be something wrong in the build system because some asm routines are not available for sparc and it does not fallback to generic routines but rather leaves undefined symbol for DecAtomicCount (and two other related functions).

By the way these functions seem thread related but passing again -t 0 to configure as used to be the case in our previous spkg does not solve the problem, the thread part still gets built, even if it may be not used.

From what I've seen on a Debian ppc64, by default the correct mut implementation of DecAtomicCount and the two other functions get picked up (note there is a ppc assembly implem but its commented as unstable and an #error statement is put in the assembly file).

But if I put back the "-t 0" param when configuring ATLAS, then these three functions do not get defined, which would be ok if other thread related functions which point to these functions were not defined...
So if I explicitely disable thread, ATLAS still builds some (but not all!) of the thread related functions and if I tried to dlopen the library the runtime linker fails with undefined symbols as reported by Karl Dieter.

Nonetheless I don't think that the problem I just stated is what Karl Dieter encountered as he used the default configuration and so should get the fallback implementaiton of DecAtomicCount and related.
I also encountered such a behavior on sparc where there is no assembly routines and somehow the fallback implementation is not picked as well.

Karl Dieter, could you post your ATLAS build log somewhere please?

Well, this *might* be due to how _Sage_ builds shared libraries from ATLAS' _static_ ones, as statically linking by default does some kind of dead code elimination ("removing" unused modules and hence potentially dead references).

Same problem (at least there is an undefined ATL_DecAtomicCount and defined ATL_GetAtomicCount in the generated libsatlas.so) with the shared libs generated using ATLAS build system rather than Volker's autotools based one.

I'm giving it a shot on Linux just to see what happens if I try to disable threads there as well.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-07 15:33:23

I have the same undefined symbols in the Linux shared libs if I build ATLAS with "-t 0" but R does not seem to care.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-07 15:41:33

In fact the Debian ppc64 install does not care either.

And there are no additional `NEEDED` tags either (?) I guess...

Hum, you got me.
What's that and how to check it?

From what I just reported it seems the undefined symbols are no problem with a non threaded build (also I guess it would be cleaner not to include all these defined thread related functions).

The problem might arise when one actually try to build a threaded lib but ATLAS fails to pick assembly or fallback code for ATL_DecAtomicCount.
I'm currently trying to build R (it never went that far, don't remember why) on a sparc system which failed to build a real threaded lib just like Karl Dieter ppc system.
It's quite slow but I should be able to report today.

On ELF systems, e.g. with `readelf -d foo.so` [ `| grep -w NEEDED` ]. :-)

These are the entries where shared libraries needed by the program / the shared library itself are recorded.

Presumably... ;-)




> The problem might arise when one actually try to build a threaded lib but ATLAS fails to pick assembly or fallback code for ATL_DecAtomicCount.

If it fails in that case (too), that's an ATLAS bug I'd say.  (Unless it would use some to-be-linked-in external functions instead, but the `ATL_` prefix indicates it doesn't [try to].)




> I'm currently trying to build R (it never went that far, don't remember why) on a sparc system which failed to build a real threaded lib just like Karl Dieter ppc system.

R is often built quite "late", not just because of its dependencies, but perhaps also due to our `deps`, i.e., the order [otherwise independent] packages are listed there  (_I think<sup>TM</sup>_).

Last info of the day, on the Debian sparc system where ATLAS failed to build a threaded lib, R did not complain either, so this may be PPC/OS X specific.

On a fast multi-core system, R will usually be the last package to finish building. But that's more because R depends on ATLAS (so it has to be built "late") and it's built mainly single-threaded.

> Karl Dieter, could you post your ATLAS build log somewhere please?
Well, I can look tomorrow, but I strongly doubt that I kept that.  The machine doesn't have tons of disk space, so I only keep one or two old builds around on it for testing.  In any case, at least at one point the spkg for this ticket had resolved the issue, or so it seems after reading through the (very lengthy) notes...

I might try starting a build with gcc 4.7 and this ticket, though, sometime later tonight.

Ok, so I'll assume the ATLAS spkg is ok for the R one now.
Nonetheless I'll report the problem of threads related stuff upstream.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-14 10:53:05

FYI, it builded ok on the Solaris 10 I have access to, including the use of the fallback mutex implementation for the DecAtomic function etal.

Somehow I forgot to do this, though I definitely built Sage.  I'll try this later today for sure.

I think you should assume so.

Sorry, I got confused and thought you were talking about Cygwin.  I will be able to check on this build in about four hours, when I am physically present at that machine.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2013-03-14 15:38:09

Aargh, it failed early on, while building the gcc-4.7 spkg.  So I'll have to put gcc-4.6.3.spkg back in, and restart the build from there.  Sorry, now I won't know until Monday - but like I said, I don't anticipate any problems, given prior experience.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-14 15:48:05

I've just updated the spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg
with:
* copy the archdefs so they are used,
* better detection of ia64,
* check return code of patch command.

I've put another devel spkg at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.11.8.p0.spkg
where I only updated the src folder and removed the long_filename patch which is now upstream.

On the debian sparc where the ATL_DecAtomic etal symbols are missing, scipy also fails because of these symbols:

```
ImportError: /infres/post/flori/sage-5.7-lame5/local/lib/libatlas.so.2: undefined symbol: ATL_DecAtomicCount
```

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-14 18:09:21

It seems to me the current spkg does not install static libraries.

And I have an undefined ATL_sammm symbol in libatlas.so which makes the check for "-lcblas -latals" fail on Linux.
Checking for LAPACK fails for the same reason.
In fact it only succeeds on my system potentially because there is a system wide libblas...

This reports on Linux are with ATLAS 3.11.8, checking now with 3.10.1

I just noticed on iras (ia64), near the beginning of the build, I get lots of error messages

```

These are present when building the old spkg (3.8.4.p1) as well as the just posted 3.10.1.p0. Are they important?

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-03-14 19:11:44

The spkg intentionally does not install static libraries because static libraries suck.

Errors during compilation are normal, its just trying out different asm routines to see which ones work.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2013-03-14 19:43:54

With the latest 3.10.1.p0 spkg on iras, the build completed in 45 minutes! Far better than the 36 hours the last time. We'll see how it handles tests...

Indeed, local/lib has liblapack.a and libblas.a when I don't use this ticket, but not with this ticket (though both have libblas.dll.a).

And I guess this is unsurprising, because we don't really do anything on Cygwin!

```
Copying /usr/lib/libblas.dll.a to /home/sagetest/sage-5.9.beta0/local/lib
```

is the extent of the log for atlas in both cases, whereas before lapack was definitely built (lots of `sage_fortran` etc. in the log) and of course now it's MIA by design.

So... do we have to now _build_ atlas on Cygwin?  I can do

```
cp /usr/lib/liblapack.a /home/sagetest/sage-5.9.beta0/local/lib
```

for now, hopefully that will work...

This ticket still has

```
# On Cygwin we simply require that the system-wide lapack is installed.
# This includes BLAS and is enough to build the rest of Sage.
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    lib = '/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a'
    if not os.path.exists(lib):
        print '*'*75
        print 'On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package'
        print 'via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the "Math" category.'
        print '*'*75 
        sys.exit(1)
    cp(lib, os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib'))
    sys.exit(0)
```

but I think that now we'll have to add to it to copy liblapack.a (or build lapack, of course).  

So I think that probably some update to this needs to be included.  Maybe this would still be enough?

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-14 20:24:37

Indeed, now ATLAS builds LAPACK itself, so if you don't build ATLAS, you don't build LAPACK either (in addition to the lapack spkg, the cblas ref implem one was also removed).

Right, but in the past we still needed the lapack stuff from Cygwin.

Also, cvxopt now fails.

Looks like a missing include of MPIR, maybe?

Not really. ATLAS does some kind of "brute force" CPU detection where it tries to compile with various options for various kinds of CPUs until one succeeds.

Well, anyway that needs to be fixed so that Cygwin knows where to find what.

No, it was in comment:299 - that's scores of comments ago.  If that is really what is needed, then you should update the ticket description (which I have now done).

Does that mean I shouldn't have used Volker's spkg for atlas either?  Does yours behave properly w.r.t. Cygwin?

Anyway, that works.
> Does that mean I shouldn't have used Volker's spkg for atlas either?  Does yours behave properly w.r.t. Cygwin?
It doesn't, at least not automatically - it just copies libblas.dll.a but not liblapack.a, and then exits.

And for Scipy's spkg-install, that's a problem when it's not in `$SAGE_LOCAL`:

```

if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    unset ATLAS
    unset BLAS
    unset LAPACK
    export LDFLAGS="-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup $LDFLAGS"
else
    export ATLAS="$SAGE_LOCAL"  
    export BLAS="$SAGE_LOCAL"
    export LAPACK="$SAGE_LOCAL"
    export LDFLAGS="-shared $LDFLAGS"
fi
```

I think it doesn't really make sense to change Scipy's spkg.  I think it _does_ make sense to copy liblapack in the same way and some messages about exactly what lapack stuff to install on Cygwin here, and then someone can use `SAGE_ATLAS_INSTALL=???` to try out atlas building on Cygwin.  Since there is a lot of other stuff going on here, I'm not going to attempt to confuse the issue by uploading my own spkg now, but JP knows what's needed and can surely<sup>TM</sup> take care of it :-)

My 3.10.1.p0 spkg is the most up to date.
You can also give the 3.11.8.p0 spkg a shot but it should not work because of the ATL_samm issue.
As this is not really working yet, I was too lazy to update the ticket descritpion.

And I did not take care of Cygwin yet; just for info the needed packge are lapack (or liblapack0) and liblapack-devel.

I first tried a little bit of ia64 and then Debian/Solaris sparc and things are quite horrible already.
There is this boring fallback threads code which is not correctly picked when configured to use threads and no assembly is available, and unfortunately the build system seems a little broken and the same broken pieces get picked up when configured not to use threads as well.
In fact I think getting it to properly install on Cygwin will be easier.

And finally there is the case of your PPC OS X 14 which seems to have similar problems as what I got on ia64/sparc.

Yours still has Volker's fix

```
if conf['Darwin?'] and not os.environ.has_key('SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH'):
    print 'Skipping build of ATLAS on intel OS X'
    if conf['PPC?']:   # OSX 10.4 PPC linker needs help to find the accelerate blas
        veclib_dir = '/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/' + \
            'Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A'
        for lib in [ 'libBLAS.dylib', 'libLAPACK.dylib']:
            ln(os.path.join(veclib_dir, lib), 
               os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib', lib))
    sys.exit(0)
```

so this should be okay.  And ia64 works fine now for installing (according to jhpalmieri - what about tests, I assume not done yet on iras?).

----

What are the work issues for this ticket?  It's hard to tell from all the comments - maybe they should be put in "work issues" :-)

See [comment:386 my comment above]: self tests fail for the new spkg. When I build Sage without `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, all tests pass (`make ptestlong`).

I had the same problem on my Solaris, it just seems that Solaris test does not like the -e flag:

```
if [ -e /infres/post/flori/sage-5.7-infres2/spkg/build/atlas-3.10.1.p0/ATLAS-bui

And this is somehow in http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html .

So we should:
* sed -e for -f on Solaris.

So I think we have more or less two problems left for ATLAS 3.10.1:
* investigate problems with threads related functions:
 * fallback code not used when assembly is not available on some systems (i.e. my Debian sparc, but not the Solaris sparc...), a first try seems that going to the build dir and retrying to build the thread related functions solves the problem as suggested here: http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/170/#6a80
 * threads functions are still included even though "-t 0" is passed, so the above problem cannot be fixed by disabling threads, it seems this is known upstream and is problematic because we use shared libraries, static should be ok, see http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/855/
* segfaults on ia64, that will be a lot of fun :) 

And later:
* fix Cygwin stuff
* solve ATL_samm for ATLAS 3.11.8

For Cygwin: libtool (which already rants on linux for this) will refuse to build .la libs from .o objects directly.
Unfortunately, I don't think there is a magical option to make it more sensible and just try (and succeed).


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-15 15:58:05

For Cygwin, using a combinaison of gcc and gfortran rather than libtool with tag=xxx to produce the shaed libs seems to be fine.
Numpy and Scipy compiled seemingly ok.

Give me the explicit instructions (including what to set `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` to) and I will try this at some point over the weekend.  I assume I'd have to muck about in the spkg-install but hopefully that won't be too annoying to do.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-15 16:25:32

I set

```
SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei2,AVX,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1
```

which was sensible for my harware, nothing different from Linux.
Anything not empty will trigger the build, so just choose what fits your hardware;
I guess "base" and "fast" should do if you have no idea.

And then I issued make (MAKE="make -j4").

It failed in the end because of libttool

```
blabla libtool cannot link non-libtool object blabla on this host blabla
```


So in a Sage shell just cd to the ($SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/atlas-3.10.1.p0/)ATLAS-lib dir, open Makefile.am and just do what is done for the different lib*.la target but more or less replace `@`LIBTOOL`@` by gcc (or gfortran if there is as well --tag=F77) for the compilation line (and don't forget lib deps -l...).
For instance to build a minimally fancy libatlas.dll:

```
mkdir libatlas-objs
cd libatlas-objs
ar x ../libatlas.a
cd ..
gcc -shared -o libatlas.dll libatlas-objs/*.o
cp libatlas.dll $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/
```

and for a fortran one for instance

```
mkdir liblapack-objs
cd liblapack-objs
ar x ../liblapack.a
cd ..
gfortran -shared -o liblapack.dll liblapack-objs/*.o -latlas -lcblas -lf77blas -lm
cp liblapack.dll $SAGE_LOCAL/lib
```

We could add fancy versioning and creating an import lib and so on, but let's try that first.

And it is; OS X 10.4 PPC is doing just fine, passing various combinat tests as we speak, certainly no build problems (with Sage's gcc 4.6, not 4.7).

I'll try the Cygwin thing later this week, did not get a chance yet.

Did it actually build ATLAS or did it use the framework thing Apple provides?
I thought that was the solution actually used.
If that's the case (look at the log), could you also try actually buliding ATLAS, by setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH to something non empty I guess,

Of course, and I pointed out that code.  We've always done this.

I guess I could try this... seems overkill.

I hate to point it out, but a slight rebase may end up being necessary for #14344 if it is merged soon.  It's pretty trivial and fixes a potentially failing doctest, so I presume it will go in soon.

Could you try running "nm libatlas.dylib|grep "DecAtomic"" on the produced shared libraries (assuming its called libatlas.dylib on OS X)?

I'll also try to build ATLAS on a more recent OS X running on Intel next week to see what happens.

I don't have to; R (and a fortiori rpy2) failed for this reason.

Matplotlib also didn't build because it couldn't find numpy, which doesn't make any sense since numpy built fine, but anyway...  Then scipy failed because of this same symbol missing.

Could somehow make the build log of ATLAS available and link it on the ATLAS support ticket I created at https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/895/

Your problem is the same I have on sparc: the lack of assembly implem should lead to the pick up of the C implem but it does not...

Done.  I should note that this shouldn't hold up this ticket.

Indeed, and nor should the similar problem on debian/sparc (I did not have problems on solaris/sparc).

So I guess the only real problems left are:
* to include the [test -f] / [test -e] fix for Solaris (I have done it at some point but don't think I've packaged it yet, I don't really remember, but quite sure I did not uploaded it anywhere).
* investigate the segfaults on iras (cannot do anything about that, no access to skynet and the ia64 computers I have access to are not problematic).

See [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/atlas-3.10.1.p0-cygwin.log) for the log.  Not that I think it will be enlightening per se.

Yup, now I got that far - apparently whatever happened before was a blip.

Eventually I was able to figure this out.  The additional step (since I didn't have automake) was to change Makefile.in and then rerun configure with the same options as before.  Oh, and apparently tabs are very necessary in make-speak, unlike Sage, and instead of `$VAR` you need `$(VAR)`.  Aargh.  

Anyway, let's cross our fingers that this works - I'd call that enough for a positive review of whenever you put something up about it on another ticket.  Yikes, you are going to turn me into someone who knows about build systems yet - that is a scary prospect.

Okay, this worked.  Scipy, Numpy, and R all built fine and `sage -ipython` importing scipy worked too.

If you produced a patch for the autotools build system Volker crafted, it would be very welcome, otherwise, I'll take care of it.
In fact, i don't think libtool should be used, but whatever.

And yes, i think we should still default to prereqing ATLAS on Cygwin, I just forgot to add this point to the one to be dealt with before hoping for a needs_review state.

I just meant that we put a check in `spkg-install` for Cygwin and then copy the appropriate libraries to $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/.  See comment:362.  I don't have time to do that right now, though.

Well, Cygwin isn't supported yet, so I don't think it needs to be here for things to be positive review.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-27 17:46:46

I've updated:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg
to include:
* the Solaris fix,
* copy correct libs on Cygwin,
* hopefully better messages about setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH for Cygwin and Darwin.

About Cywgin libs, I don't copy the static LAPACK archive but rather the import library "/usr/lib/liblapack.dll.a" (just as we did fo the BLAS one "/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a").
This should work ok and let link to the shared LAPACK library which in my opinion (and Volker's apparently) is better.
Note I've not actually tested this.

I did not:
* test on problematic ia64 systems, the ones I have access to (gcc60 and gcc66) seem fine, waiting for report of people having access to skynet, that may be considered a blocker although ia64 is not that common anymore and not all ia64 systems seem affected...
* craft or include a fixed shared library build system for Cygwin yet, but that should be postponed for a later ticket,
* fix the problems with fallback code/thread related functions which prevent building on exotic systems such as linux/sparc or (old?) darwin/ppc, but we don't support them anyway.

Note that every problem we encountered here has been reported upstream.

As I said earlier, it builds on iras now, although it [comment:366 fails its self-tests]. However, [comment:372 Sage's tests pass]. On the systems you have access to, installing with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` or with `sage -i -c atlas...` succeeds?

I'm trying to build the spkg again on Solaris and I cannot get it to work with the Sun ld, getting  "option -dn and -P are incompatible".
No troubles (to build at least) with the GNU ld.

Did the spkg work on mark with the Sun ld?
Or was it with the GNU ld?

I've tried different versions of PATH, LD and LD_ALTEXEC but could not through the configure step with Sun ld...
Any idea of what could be wrong?

Maybe the GCC Sage buit is ill configured.

It seems GCC tries to run

About my GCC rant, it seems it was indeed built using a mixture of Sun/GNU tools and was kind of broken, it is now rebuilt and looks sane.

I've also reuploaded the atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg with a minor change in spkg-install about the Cygwin packages to install (I replaced liblapack by lapack).


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-28 17:08:11

And I guess we're left with one problem:
* ATLAS does not pass its testsuite on ia64, see https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/846/

Could we put this as positive review anyway?
At least Sage passes all its own testsuite.
And I'm sure some other spkgs do not pass their testsuites on some platform, even not so unusual ones.

I would tentatively agree with this, especially since ia64 might be a bit of a fringe platform for Sage support.

Upstream should look at our ia64 provided they get access to such hardware.

So I'm putting this as needs_review as:
* the ia64 ATLAS testsuite failure does not affect Sage tests currently,
* nobody actually uses ia64,
* the bug should be fixed upstream quickly and we'll integrate the corresponding fix in an upgrade/patch.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-30 16:04:12

On Solaris I had trouble building FFLAS-FFLAPACK because cblas needs to be built with -latlas (ok, expected) and -lrt (realtime library, providing sched_yield).

Once again not sure why the linker is so picky at link time.
I had a similar issue with polybori testing for -lpng12, but that was with a seemingly ill biult GCC with GNU as and ld, and now my GCC looks saner and uses Sun ld and as.

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-03-30 16:04:53

And FFLAS-FFLAPACK tries to detect LAPACK with the same linker flags, but needs -llapack to find it...

Yes, I also renamed that patch to `shell.patch` since it's not really about Solaris but about non-portable shell tests.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-04-04 08:54:38

There are at least two bugs in the command

```
status = (rc >> 8) & 0x7f    # see http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.wait
```


The first is that `0x7f` should obviously be `0xff` (we need the high byte and bytes are still 8 bits). The second is that the low byte is completely ignored: if the process got killed by a signal, we want to know that too.

I think `subprocess.call()` is a good solution since Python recommends it anyway over `os.system()` and there is no need to fiddle with the return code (signals are returned as negative return codes).

FYI, I tried this on FreeBSD 9.0 x86 and it succeeds but leaves undefined ATL_*Atomic symbols inside as on Debian sparc or OS X 10.4 ppc which makes loading numpy fail.
The previosu ATLAS 3.8.4 spkg is broken in a similar way, but the undefined symbols there are more worrying, its some cblas_* thing...

On a FreeBSD 8.3 amd64, the build fails quite early when a "cd" command fails.
It might be a "make" issue.

Why the change from

Doesn't ATLAS use `$PATH` to execute stuff?

Besides, we should move away from the deprecated `sage_fortran` and use `$FC` instead.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-04-08 08:17:59

You should always specify full path names for stuff that you hand the atlas configuration script. Atlas does not use `$PATH` but will use `find` to locate files otherwise.

It seems somehow your last failures are caused by the fact that ATLAS finds out the generic implementation of thread related functions is as fast as the assembly one (whence the random failures I guess), and in the end both implementaitons end up in the archive, and wen Volker's code tries to make a shared library of this archive, it fails...
I'll investigate more on that later, as 'm not sure upstream which does not really use shared libraries will care.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-05-08 12:30:28

[attachment:compilers.patch] looks good.

I guess the only remaining problem now is the intermittent linker failure.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-05-14 08:49:22

I got why this is failing:
basically it seems that atlas builds the thread stuff using an assembly version and a mutex version suffixed with _mut, put everything in the static libatlas.a, and then tests if the assembly version is actually faster.
Usually it is and every thing is fine, but if not, then it rebuilds the mutex versions without the mut suffix and adds it to the static libatlas.a.
So when we turn it into a shared library the linker fails because these symbols are available in two different objects we extracted from the static archive.

Now the solution is to modify ATLAS build system which is non-trivial without upstream support but might be feasible, I'll have a look.
At first I wonder why the static archive produced for tuning is just modified (running "ar r") in the "build" phase, and not wiped out and then rebuilt from scratch.

Or just build the shared library from the static one properly ;-), i.e., don't add both (or three?) "versions" of object files to the shared library if they define the same function(s)...

Presumably because that's faster.  (There are 3200+ object files in the archive.)

I find the idea of modifying ATLAS build system just for sage worrying: we'll end up once again with basically an incompatible fork of upstream... and headaches for packagers.

Please report and fix upstream problems upstream!

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-05-14 11:00:45

How about we just delete the `*_mut.o` object files when building the shared library? This means some performance loss on ancient/barely supported architectures, but who cares?

Its been reported upstream (at least variations of these thread related problems) for a couple of months now, but not so much reaction there: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/895/.
So my plan is patching here and then propose the patch upstream.
We won't keep a broken lib or prevent integrating a newer version of a lib in Sage because upstream is not reacting or dead, that would be stupid.

That would be an easy solution.
Anyway, as I'm now trying to understand ATLAS magical build system, I'll try to solve the other thread related problems as well (not hitting Sage at the moment, but if we plan on supporting FreeBSD that will be a problem, or debian/sparc).

Also note that taurus and lena do not look that obsolete and exotic.

I don't even know what will happen (of course I know what should happen) when linking to the static library, which object file will be picked up to resolve the function call?
Volker's solution is not the right way to go but at least it will easily workaround the problem.

Good point.

Note than when I meant from scratch, I did not mean rebuild every object files, but only repacking them into a static archive.

Well, if you don't want to mess with `nm`, you could just try to build some dummy program using `ATL_<foo>AtomicCount()` with `*_mut.o` to figure out whether the latter defines the function, just like autotools usually do.  (And for each of those four modules, remove/don't include the object file with the alternate implementation in case the corresponding `*_mut.o` supplies one [with the same name].)

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-05-14 13:24:04

The right solution (TM) is to abstract away the blas/cblas/lapack/clapack compiler switches in a pkgconfig-like script. Then we could just switch to the new shared libraries that ATLAS recently introduced, or OpenBLAS, or a vendor blas... But thats for another ticket. For now, I think its a waste of time to try to change the ATLAS build system.

Something along

```sh
# Works with all nm output formats (BSD/POSIX/System V):
if [ `nm -g /path/to/libatlas.a | egrep -w 'ATL_(Set|Reset|Free|Dec)AtomicCount' | grep -w T | wc -l` -gt 4 ]; then
    # Multiple definitions, use the ones from *_mut.o
    rm `ls -1 ATL_{Set,Reset,Free,Dec}AtomicCount_*.o | grep -v '_mut.o$'`
fi
```


Or similarly run `nm` individually on the `*_mut.o` files, removing the corresponding other object file if appropriate (e.g. `if nm -g $MUT_OBJECT | grep -w $FUNCTION >/dev/null; then rm $ALTERNATE_OBJECT; fi`).

_Of course<sup>TM</sup>_, on Solaris / with Sun's `nm`, you have to use `nm -g -p ...`, but you can use that with GNU `nm` as well (despite that to the latter, it has a different meaning! :-) )

In the cvxopt spkg, the order of the Changelog entries is wrong (p0 seems to come _after_ p1).

Does it make sense to add this BLAS fix to cvxopt without upgrading ATLAS? If yes, I propose to deal with the cvxopt spkg at #12832 instead of #10508.

I've updated the spkg with an autotoolized version of leif's fix (this should automatically use proper flags for nm, even on Solaris) and flattened the three last commits (update/compilers/threads).
[attachment:thread.patch] only reflects the last new commit where I've also modified .hgignre so that configure.ac in Volker's build system is tracked.

Hopefully this will now work on all supported platforms.

In fact it should work because the bad thread related functions are not built at all because:

```
make[7]: *** [IRun_aff] Aborted (core dumped)
```

whereas on other CPUs it can fail in a different way (that what i had on FreeBSD with a single thread CPU) and let bad functions be built, or on a CPU with multiple threads this will succeeds and build some bad functions even if you passed "-t 0" when configuring ATLAS.

I guess http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#armhardfp could help...
I now have a Raspberry Pi and a Tegra3 available, so I will be able to test ATLAS on ARM now.
But note I currently have no idea of this soft/hard ABI stuff.

I would prefer to wait until upstream has sorted out the hard/softfp mess instead of trying to implement the workaround in the errata in the spkg-install. You can always use the host OS atlas library...

Same machine, 3.10.1.p0, `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` not set (this time with GCC 4.8.0, FWIW):

```
real	1244m45.739s
user	998m42.830s
sys	92m27.150s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.1.p0
```

So now seems to take even _longer_ than 3.10.0 did (although the sysload was occasionally above the number of cores).

I don't like the fact that this ticket adds _17 hours_ to the Sage build time on the slowest buildbot machine (cicero, Linux Pentium 4).

Interestingly, I haven't seen (or at least noticed) such a regression on a Pentium 4 _Prescott_.

3.8.4.p1:  ~22-27 min user/cpu time  ([also] varying GCC versions)

3.10.1.p0:  ~25 min user/cpu time  (only one figure)

(2.8 GHz, single-core / w/o HT, FWIW; *without* setting `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH`)

Could you try generating archdefs for this architecture? (unless there are already some, but in that case I don't know what to do... maybe Volker can help)
Then we can package them in the spkg.
Instruction are here: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/atlas_devel/node26.html
Basically keep the ATLAS build dir and run make ArchNew.

This looks suspicious:

```
checking whether GMP is 4.0 or greater... yes
checking for ATLAS >= 3.0... configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
```

while it should be

```
checking whether GMP is 4.0 or greater... yes
checking for ATLAS >= 3.0... found
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
```


(I always get a syntax error in `configure`, so it's likely there's even more broken crap in it; see #748.)

Could you "unapply" our weird "patch" to IML's `configure` and reinstall it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`?

(... and post the `config.log` from that.)


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-06-06 21:08:51

I tried that and it does not give any details (except that ir says that it did not find ATLAS).
Looking at configure, it searches for cblas.h that our ATLAS spkg does not install.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2013-06-06 21:12:22

[config.log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/iml-unpatched-config.log) for iml with its original `./configure` file (or at least with the appropriate line in `spkg-install` commented out). Note, by the way, that there is a "new" version of iml, 1.0.3, dating from 2008. I haven't tried using that one instead, but I don't expect it to help.

Does all of this mean that iml is completely untested in the Sage library?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-06-06 21:14:40

Putting the header from <atlas>/src/include/cblas.h  in <sage>/local/lib fixes the problem.

I guess leif was lucky because he had a system-wide cblas.h?
And in previous Sage versions we must have gotten one from the reference BLAS?

And the IML install script looks quite messy...


---

Comment by Koen created at 2013-06-06 21:17:05

In the Atlas spkg-install script, there is a function configure_atlas_library
which does not specify --incdir to the configure of Atlas. That is why the header files of Atlas are not installed in sage 5.10.rc1.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-06-06 21:20:57

Depends what you mean by untested. There are various problems with iml. I use 1.0.3 in sage-on-gentoo but the fix we have for BLAS detection is not applicable to the sage spkg. The install script is messy because there is quite some cruft in the source and patching will require running autotools on it. IML is definitely used in the sage library and it is at least indirectly called in some doctest.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-06-06 21:22:43

I'd also say we don't call ATLAS's Makefile install target.
Volker crafted an autotools stub to pack shared libraries and we install from there.

The easiest solution is to call ATLAS Makefile install target.
That will install headers (maybe requiring the incdir option) and static libraries which IMHO is a good idea.


---

I've created #14699 to discuss this issue with iml and ATLAS. We should move the discussion there.

Of course I have it, as does sage.math (which I had checked, also for system-wide libs).  I guess John was actually testing on boxen.math, which does *not* have it.

The whole [s]package is a mess, see #748.

Ticket on which I meant to work for more than a year :(


---

Comment by Koen created at 2013-06-06 21:30:53

jpflori, the static libraries are already installed for me (this is done through an shutil.copy in configure_atlas_library). I'm unsure if the header files should be copied in a similar way, or if giving an extra option to configure will be enough.
