The following does not work (as seen on #10140:

*Apply*
 1. [attachment:trac_10140_sublattice_intersection.patch]

The patch buildbot fails to understand this syntax and will try to apply all attached patches instead.

True. For now see http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot to get it to detect the correct list of patches.

I've added a new comment with a new "Apply" line to #10140 and it did reset the patch list. But the last patch on the "Apply" line is not being picked up, and I can't figure out why.

Since we have now switched to git, this can be closed.
