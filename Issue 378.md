CC:  rossk

The patch allows

```python
sage: load_attach_path()
['.']
sage: load_attach_path('/path/to/my/sage/scripts')
sage: load_attach_path()
['.', '/path/to/my/sage/scripts']
sage: attach('nifty_script1.sage')
sage: attached_files()
['/path/to/my/sage/scripts/nifty_script1.sage']
```
You can also set an environment variable:

```sh
$ export SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH="$HOME/foo:$HOME/bar"
$ sage
sage: load_attach_path()
['.', '/home/mpatel/foo', '/home/mpatel/bar']
```
Note:  We now use the full path in the attached files dictionary.

Is this still alive? I found myself in need of this functionality today and was surprised it is not there; how does anyone use the notebook locally without it?

Anyway, I'd like to help out fixing or reviewing if necessary.
I've only glanced at the current patch but found this anomaly: Shouldn't line 1399 be changed to 

```
while '' in _load_attach_path:
```
so as to remove any number of empty entries (e.g. if user wrote SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH = ":::::foo::")

Cheers, Johan

I've had a bit of a hack at exposing the array itself, but there are problems making it sufficiently global.  `sys.path` works for the stdlib because `path` is a variable in the `sys` module.  The logical thing to do here is to create a `load_attach_path` variable in the preparser module, but following the stdlib analogy this would require the user to edit `sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_path`, which is not very user friendly.

Failing this, it looks like the best you can do is a `from sage.misc.preparser import load_attach_path`, but this is a fragile state of affairs: if you reassign `load_attach_path` anywhere, either from sage's command line or by calling some function like `sage.misc.preparser.reset_load_attach_path()`, you end up with a situation where `load_attach_path` and `sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_path` are different objects.

This requires caution on the part of the user and the programmer.  For example, `reset_load_attach_path()` can't include

```
load_attach_path = ['.']
```

instead it has to do

```
while load_attach_path != []:
    load_attach_path.pop()
load_attach_path.append('.')
```

If the user accidentally reassigns `load_attach_path` in the command line, they'll have to re-run `from sage.misc.preparser import load_attach_path`.  I don't think that this step can be included in a `reset_load_attach_path()` function due to the different scopes.

So it's possible to expose the `load_attach_path` array to the user, and I've written most of a patch that does this, but there's lots of things that could go wrong so I'd suggest sticking to the existing patch's approach of hiding behind a function.  If others think that the pros outweigh the cons then I'll tidy up the patch and upload it.

Thoughts?

Very astute! I was almost finished with my own patch, falling into all the same holes as you describe :-) Your concern at least begs the question on whether this is what we want to do, as it might fool some users. However, a possible usage pattern - in case load_attach_path is fully exposed - is the following

```
   import sage.misc.preparser as pre
   pre.load_attach_path = [ ... ]
```

Still, this is not very nice, and doesn't really fit into the "import sage.all" scheme. A third possibility is to "decide" that we might very well need such global variables in other places, stemming from various other foundational modules, and therefore introduce a new module sage.misc.globals to hold these. When Sage launches, it imports this module as "globals", and so, for any global variable - say load_attach_path -, the user would access it and modify it as globals.load_attach_path. I don't think that would be unnatural at all. However, it might be overkill if load_attach_path is the _only_ such conceivable global value, but for some reason (perhaps the sheer size of Sage), I can't really think it is.

If none of these sound compelling, then I vote yes on the current form (I haven't tested the patch, that is). My only comment on the current patch, is that maybe there should be a TODO (or a fix ;-) ) in reset_load_attach_path(), which notes that probably the elements of SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH should be uniquified while preserving the order (thus, list(set(_load_attach_path)) is no good).

Otherwise good work. I'm looking forward to this patch in Sage, whatever the format :-)

Thanks to everyone for working on this ticket!

One question that may relate to how/whether we "expose" the path list:  Would users want Sage to search some paths recursively for files to load or attach?  How would we store this information?  Perhaps as

```python
['/some/path', ('/a/path/to/search/recursively', True), '/another/path']
```
?  Of course, this needn't hold up this ticket.

It may be too late for the following suggestions but Ill put them forward in case you think they have enough merit to refactor the code now (otherwise ignore them or they can go in another ticket). They are based on the idea that the main things we want to do with a path is: (1) start Sage with a sensible default (2) display what the current path is (3) set the path (4) add a folder to the end/beginning of the path (5) reset the path (6) totally clear the path. (I acknowledge some ideas have come from other packages e.g. matlab). So here's is how the path may be made to work in the future. Please let me know what you think. These are just ideas and doesnt change the good work youve already done - thanks for that!  

```
# display the default attach-path (unless a SAGE_ATTACH_PATH environment variable is set, then the attach-path when Sage starts is the path in SAGE_ATTACH_PATH)
sage: attach_path()
['.']

# set the attach path to a list of folders: ['./folder1','./folder2']
# (Note: if you want the current directory '.' included, you must specify it)
sage: attach_path(['folder1','folder2'])

# append to the (end of) attach path
sage: attach_path_join(attach_path(), ['folder3'])

# display the attach path 
sage: attach_path()
['folder1','folder2','folder3']

# add to the start of the attach path
sage: attach_path_join(['folder0'], attach_path())

# display the attach path again
sage: attach_path()
['folder0','folder1','folder2','folder3']

# append to the (end of) attach path *recursively*
sage: attach_path_join_subfolders(attach_path(), ['folder4'])

# display the attach path 
sage: attach_path()
['folder0','folder1','folder2','folder3','folder4','folder4/dir1','folder4/dir2']

# reset the attach path - sets the attach path to the default 
sage: reset_attach_path()

# clear the attach path - sets it to '' i.e. neither '.' nor SAGE_ATTACH_PATH  are included (when you want to ensure no implicit attaching is done or to rebuild the path from scratch)
sage: clear_attach_path()

# display the attach path 
sage: attach_path()
[]
