# Issue 28483: Method is_diagonalizable() should not raise an error for legitimate inputs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28720

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2019-11-12 01:24:51

This

```
m = matrix(QQ, 3, [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, -2, 1, 2])
m.is_diagonalizable()
```

raises an error rather than giving False. The error message gives an explanation why the matrix is not diagonalizable. But an `is_*()` method should give either True or False, for legitimate inputs.

As discussed in 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/OiS-_irTtWA

we fix this bug. Along the way, a companion method `diagonalization()` is newly added.

I think it is good to move authors at the begining of the file. However, you should just factorize the information. There is no need to have 10 times the same name. (many names are missing on this list as can be seen by doing a `git log`, but this is another story).

You should add doctest to `diagonalization` when an error is raised.

(If I count correctly there are 6 possible ways it can result in an error)

I added 5 ways. Is there a missing one?
