This version makes default args for friends standard compliant. That should fix the eclib problem in #12426.

I am now working on making the new spkg.  It should involve no change the library at all.

Up for review.  the patch (branch) just changes the packa-version.txt and checksums to match the new tarball.  I have tested the install using the check (-c) option and also done a make and tested the whole Sage library: no changes needed.

Tried it against the latest beta and I couldn't see anything either. Given your commits I would be surprised.

Thanks.  Julien P says that the configure script needs adjustment to work properly with the new NTL but that only applies if you do _not_ give the flag --with-ntl explicitly;  we do, so this should not cause trouble with the NTL upgrade.

Not my experience. I updated the sage-on-gentoo ebuild and it is configured with 

```
--disable-allprogs --with(out)-flint --with(out)-boost
```

and it finds ntl fine. Is it only a trouble to find it in a sage install that sets CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS?

Was that using the new NTL, i.e. 6.2.0 or 6.2.1 (yesterday's bugfix)?  I understand that the problem is that if you do not give any --with-ntl then configure uses the AC_SEARCH_LIB command from configure.ac to look for the specific symbol _ntl_gmul but this symbol does not exist in the new NTL.  And all (or almost all) symbols which do exist are mangled versions of C++ function names, which are unsuitable for this purpose (basically because different compilers mangle things in deifferent ways).  On my system the configure works fine using --with-ntl or --with-ntl=yes or --with-ntl=#usr/local, since none of these run the AC_SEARCH_LIB command, and then the compiler and linker do find the include files and libraries without further assistance, but if I do not mention --with-ntl on the configure line then it runs the test and it fails.

This discussion probably does not belong here since in any case Sage uses an explicit  --with-ntl="$SAGE_LOCAL" which avoids the problematical AC_SEARCH_LIB anyway.

Right! I didn't try ntl 6.2.x you are right (face palm). You shouldn't need the mangled symbol to write the test, this is pure ignorance. Most C++ compiler vendors have agreed to a common mangling scheme back at the time the release of gcc 3.4.0. It is virtually unchanged since then. I don't know a vendor that doesn't use that scheme. It is even arch independent. What doesn't work without precaution is calling C from C++ without properly declaring it extern_C (or something like that), if you don't, the c++ compiler will look for a mangled symbol when C doesn't have any mangling.

I have had some more private correspondence with Julien Puydt.  He suggests using a test like the one used by linbox at http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/linbox.git/tree/macros/ntl-check.m4 for when no --with-ntl at all is provided.  Otherwise we can continue to assume that the user has given a sensible answer for --with-ntl which will work, as is certainly the case in Sage.

Cannot say I like the macro in style or substance. But looking at your configure.ac I can see why you have the current behavior. I think it is wrong and I think using AC_CHECK_LIB is good. Now I see where the mangling issue comes from. It is exactly the opposite of what I say don't work for sure, your test is compiled with a C compiler which doesn't understand that the symbols are mangled. Somehow the symbol that you were testing previously must have been from a part of the library in C.

We can solve that problem by switching to the c++ for the test [https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.65/html_node/Language-Choice.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.65/html_node/Language-Choice.html) and then reverting back for the rest. I may have closer look tomorrow and post a pull request on github.

Sounds good, thanks.

I was considering the AC_LANG_PUSH/AC_LANG_POP dance to build&run a C++ program just like the linbox macro does. Does that look sane?

Does to me!
