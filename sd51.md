There is an [automatically generated list of all tickets worked on during Sage Days 51](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/90). Please add sd51 to the keyword field of every ticket you work on during [Sage Days 51](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedaysleiden) so that it appears in this list.

The slides of the sage/git talk are [here](http://drugtestbots.info/leiden.pdf). For people who want to try this, you can grab a pre-built tarball: if you have access to the sage machines, copy the file /home/tkluck/sage-git.tar.gz.
