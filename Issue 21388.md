You mean during the build of Singular itself or Sage modules using Singular?

See #17254#comment:510 :
"""
During linking some Sage files I see -lomalloc -lSingular -lpolys -lfactory -lresources which does not look that right.
"""

That's an annoying defect that I have noticed before in the python interface to pkg-config. The libraries are put in a set and of course it is not preserving the order. It was already evident when using ATLAS for blas/lapack.

```
$ pkg-config --libs Singular
-lSingular -ldl -lpolys -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -ldl -lfactory -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -lomalloc -lresources 
```

but

```
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jun 12 2016, 19:30:46) 
[GCC 5.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pkgconfig
>>> singular_pc = pkgconfig.parse('Singular')
>>> list(singular_pc['libraries'])
[u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr']
>>> singular_pc['libraries']
set([u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr'])
```

which is what you are seeing. If you still have a sage with ATLAS somewhere look at what you get for lapack. This needs to be fixed upstream so that something preserving the order is used instead of a set.

Is this upstream:
* https://github.com/matze/pkgconfig
?

It does not look very active, last release was three years ago.

Debian also thinks that is the homepage, yes.

Well `pkg-config` is relatively stable. The nice thing about the set is of course that you don't have repeated elements in it. Is there an "ordered set" type in python?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-12 20:08:24

After a bit of googling I think upstream should either depend from an "ordered set" package or switch to a dictionary of list instead of a dictionary of set and then remove duplication.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-14 01:38:42

I have been working on making `pkgconfig` use lists instead of sets and then doing some deduplication. 

There are two issues with deduplication - which was originally achieved by using sets:
* Is it really necessary, that makes longer lines but `pkg-config` doesn't do it in the first place. Which brings us to second issue
* Currently the first instance of everything is kept. Not a problem for macros, may be for include directories and library directories. Definitely a potential problem for libraries.

I don't think deduplication - potentially from the end of the list rather than the beginning of it, is worth it.

Opinion?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-14 07:04:45

I agree with FranÃ§ois: we shouldn't be smarter than necessary. There is nothing wrong with longer command lines (as long as it's not excessive).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-14 20:54:52

OK, I definitely think it is not worth the bother so I'll probably go with this branch for my upstream pull request https://github.com/kiwifb/pkgconfig/tree/listify. If anyone wants to comment, now is the time.

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-16 10:28:58

Upstream accepted my change, hopefully that will come with a new release soon. I did some experiments, while we will be able to simplify sage's code to populate the various variables `*_{libs,library_dirs,include_dir}` it should work out of the box without modification (haven't checked cflags actually).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-16 20:18:50

Not sure when upstream will cut a release, should we patch in the meantime?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-11-17 13:44:45

I say we patch.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-22 22:16:10

Working on this. Some adjustments are needed in `modules_list.py`.

Would it make sense to bump the Singular version to force a rebuild with the new `pkgconfig`?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-25 06:32:19

I guess so, of course we need to bump `singular` one way or another before 7.5 is released. But I can easily add a commit here and have the singular ticket depend on it.

On second thought, the problem is really in `pkgconfig` (the Python package) which simply reads the system `.pc` files. So there is no need to regenerate the `.pc` files. So no further action is needed I guess.

I am now going to do a complete build from scratch with this ticket and see if it works...

This seems to break building scipy, log attached.

Hum, I can reproduce it. It is triggered by the `site.cfg` generated for `numpy` (installed at `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/distutils/site.cfg`). There is now a repetition of `openblas` for `blas_libs` and that seems to be the issue strangely enough (it should be able to take more than one library).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-26 09:51:40

Ok `pkgconfig` (python) does another thing that's weird compared to `pkg-config`. I can do this

```
(sage-sh) fbissey`@`QCD-nzi3:sage$ pkg-config --libs blas cblas
-L/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage/local/lib -lopenblas 
```

but `pkgconfig` (python) will do two calls to `pkg-config` and add them together. Of course with sets that wasn't visible. In any case we should be able to survive with just `blas` in `numpy`'s `site.cfg`. I am not sure why Gentoo insists on both - possibly historical reasons.

You'll need to rebuild `numpy` before `scipy` for the fix to work.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-26 11:00:42

I don't really like that fix. It should not be a problem to have `-lopenblas -lopenblas` in the libraries.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-26 19:11:51

I would have to dig inside `numpy`. That's where the problem is, really. But it could need a mirror fix in `scipy`. I think it would be better to go back to `pkgconfig`and add a patch to make its output more consistent, both internally and with `pkg-config`. That wouldn't do anything for `numpy`/`scipy` setup problem of course.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-26 20:13:19

Please bump the numpy version number since the change you make is non-trivial.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-26 20:16:47

Was thinking about that. I am not satisfied with the branch as it is anyway. I will hammer some more on `pkgconfig` side with another pull upstream as soon as I can. I'll probably revert my last commit but even so it is probably best if `numpy` is bumped as well.

If you cannot immediately fix the real issue, it's OK for me to merge this hack as-is.

I'm setting it back to needs_work because you still want to work on it.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-29 23:05:05

I have pushed a few more things upstream and requested a release.  The changes I sent upstream makes my last commit unnecessary, so at the very least I'll retract it. If upstream makes a new release, I'll update the package instead of adding more patches.

OK, new release from upstream with all fixes included. Now the output is list, which keep the order, and is also strictly mirroring the output of the equivalent `pkg-config` command. The extra 2 minor releases are for various fixes to the tests that we don't use in sage but are important for me in Gentoo since I do run `nose` tests.
