You mean during the build of Singular itself or Sage modules using Singular?

That's an annoying defect that I have noticed before in the python interface to pkg-config. The libraries are put in a set and of course it is not preserving the order. It was already evident when using ATLAS for blas/lapack.

```
$ pkg-config --libs Singular
-lSingular -ldl -lpolys -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -ldl -lfactory -lflint -lmpfr -lntl -lgmp -lomalloc -lresources 
```
but

```
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jun 12 2016, 19:30:46) 
[GCC 5.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pkgconfig
>>> singular_pc = pkgconfig.parse('Singular')
>>> list(singular_pc['libraries'])
[u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr']
>>> singular_pc['libraries']
set([u'omalloc', u'dl', u'Singular', u'polys', u'factory', u'flint', u'ntl', u'gmp', u'resources', u'mpfr'])
```
which is what you are seeing. If you still have a sage with ATLAS somewhere look at what you get for lapack. This needs to be fixed upstream so that something preserving the order is used instead of a set.

I have been working on making `pkgconfig` use lists instead of sets and then doing some deduplication. 

There are two issues with deduplication - which was originally achieved by using sets:
* Is it really necessary, that makes longer lines but `pkg-config` doesn't do it in the first place. Which brings us to second issue
* Currently the first instance of everything is kept. Not a problem for macros, may be for include directories and library directories. Definitely a potential problem for libraries.

I don't think deduplication - potentially from the end of the list rather than the beginning of it, is worth it.

Opinion?

On second thought, the problem is really in `pkgconfig` (the Python package) which simply reads the system `.pc` files. So there is no need to regenerate the `.pc` files. So no further action is needed I guess.

I am now going to do a complete build from scratch with this ticket and see if it works...
