This is my very first approach simply copied from the previous ones. However, I noticed that in lower dimensions, the parallelization is even slower. Furthermore, one could improve this process a little bit further just my considering distinct indices from the beginning (see the check in the loop).

I appreciate any help since I am not familiar with effective parallelization.

Some computations in 4 dimensions made it slightly worse: from around 8 sec to 15 sec. In contrast, more complicated computations in 6 dimensions yield a good improvement.

However, I noticed that the cpus are not fully engaged and run around 20-80% workload, varying all the time. Hence, there is much room for improvement.

I appreciate any suggestions. I feel a little bit lost here.

Interestingly, I dropped the summation completely, and still, the computation takes longer than without parallelization. This is odd, isn't it?

Even this modification doesn't improve anything:


```python
        ind_list = [(ind_s, ind_o) for ind_s in cmp_s._comp
                                   for ind_o in cmp_o._comp
                    if len(ind_s+ind_o) == len(set(ind_s+ind_o))]
        nproc = Parallelism().get('tensor')
        if nproc != 1:
            # Parallel computation
            lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i + sz] for i in
                                   range(0, len(lst), sz)]
            ind_step = max(1, int(len(ind_list) / nproc))
            local_list = lol(ind_list, ind_step)
            # list of input parameters:
            listParalInput = [(cmp_s, cmp_o, ind_part) for ind_part in
                              local_list]

            @parallel(p_iter='multiprocessing', ncpus=nproc)
            def paral_wedge(s, o, local_list_ind):
                partial = []
                for ind_s, ind_o in local_list_ind:
                    ind_r = ind_s + ind_o
                    partial.append([ind_r, s._comp[ind_s] * o._comp[ind_o]])
                return partial
            for ii, val in paral_wedge(listParalInput):
                for jj in val:
                    cmp_r[[jj[0]]] = jj[1]
        else:
            # Sequential computation
            for ind_s, ind_o in ind_list:
                ind_r = ind_s + ind_o
                cmp_r[[ind_r]] += cmp_s._comp[ind_s] * cmp_o._comp[ind_o]
```


If `nproc` is set to 1, the original speed is preserved.

I am fully aware that this leads to wrong results and the summation should be covered within the parallelization, somehow. Nevertheless, this seems strange to me.

Besides this odd fact, do you have any ideas how the summation can be parallelized, too?
