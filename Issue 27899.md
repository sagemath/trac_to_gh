# Issue 27899: Add number_of_subgroups() method to AbelianGroup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28136

Keywords: abelian group fpsac

Using `len(AbelianGroup(...).subgroups())` to find the number of subgroups of an abelian group is inefficient. Using the function `sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` should be much faster. This will also allow to find the number of subgroups of a given order.

some tests in torsion_subgroup are not testing the right method

A few little details in addition to Frédéric's comment:

Remove the period at the end here:

```
        - ``order`` -- (default: ``None``) find the number of subgroups of this
          order; if ``None``, this defaults to counting all subgroups.
```


Typo: `infinitly` -> `infinitely`

This is faster:

```diff
             for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
-                p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
-                p_exps = Partition(p_exps)
-                orders_by_prime[p] = range(p_exps.size() + 1)
+                orders_by_prime[p] = range(sum(p_exps) + 1)
```

there is no need to create the partition just to get its size.

I don't understand what this code does:

```python
            for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
                p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
                p_exps = Partition(p_exps)
                orders_by_prime[p] = [order_exps[p]]
```

`p_exps` is never used to do any computation. Shouldn't you just remove that part?

I am guessing you are meaning to modify in place the `p_exps`, which the call to `sort` does, but I am pretty sure the `Partition` call does not. In either case, this should be done in the loop you actually use it:

```diff
         for p, p_exps in six.iteritems(sylow_types):
             p_result = Integer(0)
+            p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
             for i in orders_by_prime[p]:
                 for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps):
                     p_result += q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
             result *= p_result
         return result
```

Thanks, fixed. Mmmm, that was an embarrassing oversight.

Thanks, fixed.

For the other things, I think I wanted to use the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), thinking that `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group` needs to an integer partition for input. Now I removed even importing `Partition` and followed your suggestions.

I think my changes might have increased the types of input it could take, but is not so important.

One last thing I noticed (which should result in a speedup):

```diff
-            p_result = Integer(0)
             p_exps.sort(reverse=True)
-            for i in subgroups_orders_by_prime[p]:
-                for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps):
-                    p_result += q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
-            result *= p_result
+            result *= sum(q_subgroups_of_abelian_group(p_exps, mu, q=p)
+                          for i in subgroups_orders_by_prime[p]
+                          for mu in Partitions(i, outer=p_exps))
```

It would be even faster if you avoided the transient `Partition` objects and just passed a list, but that would mean modifying `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group`, possibly for not much gain. (Definitely a separate ticket.)

In general, after trying to use lists instead of `Partition` objects, it always seems like the start of a re-implementation of `Partition`'s methods. I assume speeding up src/sage/combinat/partition.py, for example cythonizing it, will bring more benefit. But that is for a separate ticket, too.

For `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group`, there is the helper function `sage.combinat.partition.conjugate` which return a list (and is used in `Partition.conjugate`), but it still not enough to remove the convenience of using `Partition`.

Instead of iterating over `Partitions(i, outer=p_exps)` I tried `IntegerListsLex` and there was a speedup. Does the code looks clearer with the "long" `sum`? I do not mind making the change.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

replaced `six.iteritems()` with `.items()`. Ready for review.

Put your name down in the author slot so the patchbot will run. Once that comes back green, then positive review. Sorry for loosing track of this.

Thanks. I forget this, and then wonder why the patchbot did not run.
