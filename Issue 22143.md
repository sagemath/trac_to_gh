I don't know about debian and other but we split `suitesparse` in components in Gentoo. I would be shocked if the other didn't do the same. It looks like upstream integrated a lot of the autoconfig patches that were floating around which makes life easier.
What cvxopt needs:
* suitesparseconfig
   *amd
     *umfpack
  *colamd
     *cholmod

Indentation is for dependency. That's without optional or more complicated configuration - a minimal setup (although options using blas/lapack could be enabled without extra burden). All the above in mimimum configuration is LGPL 2.1. In non-mimimum configuration some switch to GPL-2.

Well we are a bit old school but the instructions of the README at https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo are still working. One day I'll update them to something a little bit more modern. Note that you also need the science overlay. I won't finish sage 8.4 tongiht I am afraid. Too much to do, it will be ready in 12 hours.

A somewhat cryptic error:

```
!!! The ebuild selected to satisfy "sage" has unmet requirements.
- sci-mathematics/sage-8.4::sage-on-gentoo USE="X doc-html-bin -bliss -debug -doc-html -doc-pdf -doc-pdf-bin -jmol -latex -modular_decomposition -sagenb -testsuite" ABI_X86="(64)" L10N="-ca -de -en -es -fr -hu -it -ja -pt -ru -tr" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_6"

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    doc-html-bin? ( l10n_en )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    doc-html? ( l10n_en sagenb ) doc-pdf? ( sagenb ) testsuite? ( any-of ( doc-html doc-html-bin ) ) doc-html-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) doc-pdf-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) any-of ( python_targets_python2_7 python_targets_python3_6 )

no idea what's wrong. Changing `doc-html-bin` to `-doc-html-bin` allows the build to go forward.

> Yes it is unusual. And very strange. There is some control for openmp in the main makefile I think so it has to be turned off there (or autodetected properly there). But not finding stuff in `/usr/local/lib` is highly unusual - and it appears this is not your compiler's fault but ld's fault. Is it GNU ld, some kind of BSD ld or llvm's ld?


```
$ ld -v
LLD 6.0.1 (FreeBSD 335540-1200005) (compatible with GNU linkers)

yep. If it is called directly, it does not know where to look for libraries, so one much pass

Definitely not called directly (I checked) the compiler is called to do the linking so `-fopenmp` should set all the flags properly. I am calling that a bug in linking driver of the compiler.

I specifically disabled the bits requiring cmake. The packages requiring cmake are not used by any other of the packages. It somewhat feels like someone is packaging some pet packages along the more widely used stuff.

I guess I could go "redux" and only install what we need. Note that some bits of suitesparse are also bundled (as in vendored) in `glpk`. And because `glpk` is autotooled, removing the bundled bits would require patching configure and generating a sage specific tarball.
