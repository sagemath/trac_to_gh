# Issue 23375: Include !python3 in default value for SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23612

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2017-08-11 15:15:23

`SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` has a default setting of `!python2` since that package does not pass its test suite. The same is true for Python 3, so we should include `!python3` in the default value, too.

This should be changed :-)

So positive_review modulo that.
