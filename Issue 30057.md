# Issue 30057: Minimal Resultant Locus

We aim to implement the algorithm given in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1201.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1201.pdf) to compute the minimal resultant locus using number fields.

Given a dynamical system, we can compute the resultant of the system as the resultant of the defining polynomials. The resultant, however, is not constant under conjugacy. We can therefore conjugate by appropriate linear maps to reduce the absolute value of the resultant. The minimal resultant locus is the segment of Berkovich space where the minimal order of the resultant is achieved.

This ticket depends heavily on the implementation of Berkovich space in #29844 and the implementation of dynamical systems on Berkovich space in #29949.

You should fill the "Author" field above here with your real name

First line of doc should use Return instead of Returns

and do not import metaclass from six, but use python3 syntax for metaclass

Please look at the patchbot plugins for this kind of stuff.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
