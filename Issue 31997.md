# Issue 31997: Remove code for fast_float(old=True)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32234

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-07-18 22:58:12

CC:  chapoton @mjungmath egourgoulhon vdelecroix @mwageringel kcrisman slelievre nbruin

The old code was replaced by new code in 2009 and is unused in the library.

```
$ git grep 'fast_float *(.*old *='
src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx:    sage: f = fast_float(sqrt(x^7+1), 'x', old=True)
src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx:def fast_float(f, *vars, old=None, expect_one_var=False):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(K(0), old=True))
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(K(17), old=True))
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx:            sage: list(fast_float(y, old=True))
```

Cc'ing the last person who modified `numerical_integral`...

Needs review, or are you waiting to see if the three uses of `_fast_float_` can be removed?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-21 16:00:06

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-21 16:00:06

I was kind of hoping that we can get rid of these `_fast_float_`-using methods, but we can of course do that later

Comment by mjo created at 2021-07-21 16:21:11

It's unfortunate that there is a `_fast_callable_` method on symbolic expressions that seems to do something else entirely... but this appears to be all that is necessary to update `find_local_minimum()`:

Possibly the name is unfortunate, but the presence of the method is actually what makes `fast_callable` work. Given that it implements the protocol that makes `fast_callable` work, I think the name is actually quite understandable.

I've updated the three files mentioned in the description. The doctests in those files pass but I haven't run the full suite yet.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-21 21:06:40

Great, thanks.

If there are no problems, we can now remove more code - all `_fast_float_` methods in all classes

There's another use of `_fast_float_` in `Expression.find_root`, could you take care of this one please?

Some more things:
- `src/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.py` uses `fast_float_arg`

- some files import `fast_callable` from the wrong module

There's a different `fast_callable` function in sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py, if that's what you're seeing?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-21 22:18:52

I'm referring to:

```
src/sage/numerical/optimize.py:    from sage.ext.fast_eval import fast_callable
```



---

Comment by mjo created at 2021-07-21 22:27:55

Ok, I fixed that and the same import in `sage/calculus/riemann.pyx`. I think I've fixed `find_root()` too but `sage -b` is complaining about `FastDoubleFunc` in `sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.pyx` at the moment.

Sure, I was trying to fix the `fast_float_arg` thing, but here are the two aforementioned commits.

FWIW here's a way to mimic `fast_float_arg(0)` and `fast_float_arg(1)`:


```python
sage: u = SR.symbol('u', domain='real')                                         
sage: v = SR.symbol('v', domain='real')                                         
sage: u = fast_callable(u, vars=[u,v])                                          
sage: v = fast_callable(v, vars=[u,v])
sage: u(1,2)                                                                    
1
sage: v(1,2)                                                                    
2
```

Using `SR` feels ugly there, but for lack of a better idea, it works.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-22 00:05:01

I would be concerned that this puts global assumptions on these two variables


---

Comment by mjo created at 2021-07-22 00:25:06

I could either remove the `domain='real'`, or replace the whole thing with e.g.


```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(RDF, 'u,v')                                            
sage: u = fast_callable(R.gen(0), vars=R.gens())                                
sage: v = fast_callable(R.gen(1), vars=R.gens())                                
sage: u(1,2)                                                                    
1.0
sage: v(1,2)                                                                    
2.0
```



---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-22 00:39:41

either way should be fine, or perhaps use `ExpressionTreeBuilder.var` directly

Should be fixed now. Numpy didn't know what to do about NaN unless `domain=float` was specified.

Not important, but one of those example functions isn't doing what the doctest thinks it does:


```
sage: f(x) = 0.0 / max(0, x)                                                                                                                                                 
sage: f                                                                                                                                                                      
x |--> NaN
```


since


```
sage: max(0, x)

As this ticket makes changes to plotting functions, it would be good to check that there are no speed regressions


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-07-22 15:00:13

In the next step, we could deprecate the compatibility function `fast_float` and switch all uses to direct calls to `fast_callable`. Perhaps best in a follow-up ticket.

Feeling a bit stupid right now because `lambda u,v: v` is about four times as fast as the complicated fast-callable-arg2 stuff on my machine.

Comment by mjo created at 2021-10-02 22:53:56

I looked through this one more time, and noticed that `domain=float` can be used in the earlier commits as well (the functions/results get passed to external library routines expecting floats anyway). I've added a commit to do that, and rebased onto beta2.

Shall we say we've eached reviewed the other's contribution here?
