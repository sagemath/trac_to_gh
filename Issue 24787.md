Since we enabled the testsuite for PCRE, it fails on the arando patchbot for example:

```
[pcre-8.40.p1] FAIL: RunTest
[pcre-8.40.p1] FAIL: pcrecpp_unittest
[pcre-8.40.p1] FAIL: pcre_scanner_unittest
[pcre-8.40.p1] PASS: pcre_stringpiece_unittest
[pcre-8.40.p1] PASS: RunGrepTest

Does it actually fail to build, or is it just a testsuite issue? We make no promises that all package testsuites work on all machines, in fact they do not.

It doesn't build because we run the testsuite as part of the build.

Oh good, this approach makes much more sense.
