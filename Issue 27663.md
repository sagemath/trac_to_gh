Actually, Ben, could you quickly check that the failure in `parent.pyx` reported by the patchbot does not occur? I cannot test it right now. If it passes on your machine, you can set this back to a positive review.

hmm...not sure here. I tested just that file and the patchbot failure line 1734 of that file fails both on my branch and on my clean beta branch. I seem to also get a failure on line 1737 of that file with the same maximum recursion depth error. These seem totally unrelated to the functionality I touched, but they are failing when I test that file.


'make ptestlong' did not have these failures for me.

I was pretty sure it was unrelated, but it is good to check. Thank you for checking. (Sorry I couldn't do it, my copies of Sage are all currently running some longer computations.)
