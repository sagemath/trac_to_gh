Assignee: tbd

The Mercurial spkg (#10594) created a file `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc` enabling the "pager" extension.  This is very bad for scripts using Mercurial and should be disabled.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12058

There are 6 occurences of `hg diff` in the `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/*` scripts, so I disagree.

Wrong, this was introduced in #10594.  It is the Mercurial spkg which writes `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc`.  On #11121 I have made a comment that I did not want the pager extension to be enabled by default.

True, but I think that is an orthogonal issue.  Even if we do use `HGPLAIN` in scripts, I think we still should not enable the pager extension by default.

Yes, and all six of them are mysterious and seem unnecessary to me.

Do you propose to also revert #11142, which explicitly uses the pager extension?

No, I think using the pager within Sage is fine, analogously to how "`is_prime?`" runs a pager.  In Sage, there is no simple way to explicitly run a pager (in the shell, it's easy to type "`hg diff |less`")

I don't think it's a bad idea to bundle Mercurial.  I actually like how the Sage scripts like `sage-sdist` use Mercurial.

> But one of the main goals behind the way Sage is set up is to lower the barrier of entry and make things easier for beginner developers, and I think part of that goal involves making `sage -hg` as user-friendly as possible.
Okay, agreed.

Well, I think the "git" default is good to have, also the encoding being utf-8 (through `HGENCODING` set in `sage-env`).  I never argued about that, only about the pager.

If you call mercurial from within sage ('hg-sage' and friends) to diff then we pass `--config pager.pager=...` in `sage/misc/hg.py`. So whether or not the pager is enabled by default in the `hgrc` is just a matter of taste.

My vote would be:
* Use `HGPLAIN` in scripts if necessary.
* Keep the pager extension to intentionally break scripts that forget to set `HGPLAIN`.

Sounds great to me. Keep in mind that the pager extension will not break scripts that forget to set `$HGPLAIN` unless `$PAGER` is also set while the script is run, or `pager.pager` is set to something in some `hgrc` somewhere.

after a lot of scrolling.  No surprise, perhaps.

The whole point of `hg_sage` is for it to be EASY for people to use.  Now it is not.  I'm not quite sure what happened in this ticket, and in general the changes of late with Mercurial and paging seemed ok, but this did something very different.
