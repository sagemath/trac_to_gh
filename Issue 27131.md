# Issue 27131: Allow supercrystals category to be inherited by default for subcrystals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27368

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2019-02-26 22:54:07

CC:  aschilling bsalisbury1

Keywords: crystals, supercrystals

This should be inherited by default so that it behaves properly:

```
sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['A',[1,1]], [2,1])
sage: S = T.subcrystal(max_depth=3)
sage: S.category()
Category of finite crystals
```
