Your description of the function needs work.


> It prescribes the function or method’s effect as a command (“Do this”, “Return that”), not as a description; e.g. don’t write “Returns the string representation ...”. [0]

Could you add a few more line breaks to respect `<= 72` characters per line for docstrings (where possible). [1]

I turned all first lines to imperative mode and made a few more lines shorter.

Is this enough ?

Could you split

```
- ``finite``, ``affine``, ``elliptic``, ``mutation_finite``
```

to have one point for one argument.

We also have `:wikipedia:`.

Why haven't you touched the lines 300 to 332 (part of `QuiverMutationType.__doc__`)?

Builds fine now. As this is all cosmetic I dare to set positive.
