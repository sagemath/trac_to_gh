Keywords: rigged configurations

Implement the rigged configuration to tensor product of KR tableaux bijection as defined by Okado-Sano and its generalization.

This requires some refactoring of the general bijection code and generalizing the D<sub>4</sub><sup>(3)</sup> KR tableaux for `r = 2` code.
