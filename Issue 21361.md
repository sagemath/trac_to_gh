# Issue 21361: psutil: platform cygwin not supported

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21598

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2016-09-26 11:52:58

Installing psutil on cygwin simply doesn't work.  It actually refuses to install on cygwin.  See attached log.

I will investigate why psutil doesn't support Cygwin.  It's probably something I can fix.

I wouldn't say it's a "bug" per se, but close enough.  Upstream has blessed adding Cygwin support given my offer to provide it.  This is non-trivial extra work for me that I wasn't expecting to have, unfortunately, but I don't think it will be _that_ hard to get psutil at least minimally functioning on Cygwin.

For the record, _currently_ `psutil` is not used yet by Sage. The intent was to use it to replace `src/sage/misc/memory_info.py`: determine the amount of physical/swap memory and the virtual memory resource limit.

Right, I noticed that it's not used yet, so for now I've simply disabled the psutil package in my build.  But I still think we _should_ use it, in which case we'll want it to work on cygwin as well (or have cygwin-specific workarounds in Sage, but that's not very nice).

(Depending on how long this work takes, maybe it would be best to actually remove the psutil spkg for now, until it's actually depended on.  But I could go either way.)

That would make sense to do when a new stable release would come out. As long as we are in the "beta" stage, it doesn't really matter much.

I think it is pretty easy to use it. So it should not take much effort. But maybe it would be better for the Sage-on-Cygwin project to not immediately use `psutil`?

It would probably help to wait on that, yeah.  I'm working on a Cygwin port of psutil though, so once that's ready it will be less hassle to move forward with using psutil.  As I wrote in the upstream issue, it doesn't look like it will be that hard.  Many bits from the Linux module of psutil work on Cygwin.  Other bits can be pulled in from the existing Windows module, as appropriate.  Most of the work is refactoring.

Any progress on this? I am considering moving forward on #21805.

I was working on that a while ago, but haven't picked it up in a few weeks.  It would be good to get back to it soon.  It was taking longer than I'd hoped--although there aren't any major blockers there are just a lot more interfaces in psutil than I realized (it's grown a lot in functionality since I last used it), so it's a lot of work to do a complete port.  I might be able to provide, for the short term, just a partial port (applied as a patch) that works just for the interfaces Sage needs if you tell me specifically which ones those are (I know it's mainly just for memory-related stuff).

The attached patch applies my prototype for Cygwin support in psutil.  It actually supports most of psutil's interfaces on Cygwin, not just (but certainly including) the handful used by Sage.  I could maybe make a pared down patch with just the bare minimum, but I'm not sure that's worth the trouble now.  The patch applies to psutil 5.2.0 hence the dependency on #22625

I think that this Cygwin module for psutil still needs more refactoring work before it's ready to merge upstream, but I plan to continue working on it when I can.  In the meantime, this version works (it passes psutil's test suite).  This issue is a major blocker to Cygwin support so it would be helpful to add this patch now, as I don't know how much longer it will take to get a final version of it upstream.

Building fails for me, at the very start (on cygwin64):

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 253, in <module>
    macros.append(("_WIN32_WINNT", get_winver()))
  File "setup.py", line 249, in get_winver
    maj = int(m.group('major'))
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Error: could not determine package name
```

Could you say a little more about what Windows version you're using?  What does the output of `cmd /c ver` show for you?

Note the case mismatch between `version` returned above and `Version` in your regexp in `setup.py`.


---

Comment by embray created at 2017-03-27 15:24:21

Hah, mine is the _exact same_ version except it prints "Version" instead of "version".  Maybe it's a locale difference.

I made the regular expression in the `setup.py` more permissive; should build now.

Why not get have `[vV]ersion`? I feel that it should not be as permissive as your changes.

What is the upstream situation of this patch? Has it been submitted?

In Japanese it's "バージョン".

Ah, I see.

How about Jeroen's comment:23?

I updated the description with a link to my pull request.  In short, I have submitted this patch as proof of concept, but I acknowledged in doing so that it's not ready.  The code works though, it just needs refactoring.  For the purposes of patching psutil in Sage it's fine though.

Ah yes, of course.  I agree it's a significant enough patch that we want to make sure it doesn't break the existing patchbots.
