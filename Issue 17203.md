Well, I'm not a statistician and this behaviour surprised me.

I'm not necessarily saying that the functions shouldn't do something weird on a 1-list input (though for my use, I wouldn't mind that it just returned 0). I do suggest that in this case the functions should throw a ValueError with an appropriate message, and that the behaviour be mentioned in the doctest.

I think raising an exception would be much better than returning `NaN`.

Yes, perhaps an appropriate exception would be better, I don't think 0 is the right answer.
