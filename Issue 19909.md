this is a limitation of gfan, cf. Sect. A.2 (p.34) of http://home.math.au.dk/jensen/software/gfan/gfanmanual0.5.pdf

a better interface should automatically do renaming.

This applies only to my comment about the variable names, or do you also mean to address the bug report?

I meant to say that the Sage gfan interface should do automatic variable renaming to prevent this sort of a problem. Should not be hard to fix, in fact.

The problem is that the gfan code uses `ideal_to_gfan_format` which expects the generators of an ideal to come as a list. But they don't:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,"x11,x12,x13,x14,x21,x22,x23,x24,x31,x32,x33,x34"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(3,x)
sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
sage: I.gens()
[-x12*x21 + x11*x22, -x13*x21 + x11*x23, -x14*x21 + x11*x24, -x13*x22 + x12*x23, -x14*x22 + x12*x24, -x14*x23 + x13*x24, -x12*x31 + x11*x32, -x13*x31 + x11*x33, -x14*x31 + x11*x34, -x13*x32 + x12*x33, -x14*x32 + x12*x34, -x14*x33 + x13*x34, -x22*x31 + x21*x32, -x23*x31 + x21*x33, -x24*x31 + x21*x34, -x23*x32 + x22*x33, -x24*x32 + x22*x34, -x24*x33 + x23*x34]
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,"x11,x12,x13,x14,x15,x21,x22,x23,x24,x25,x31,x32,x33,x34,x35"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(3,x)
sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
sage: I.gens()
Polynomial Sequence with 30 Polynomials in 15 Variables
```

I will provide a patch preparsing `I.gens()` before giving it to `ideal_to_gfan_format`.

That is indeed the problem. Did you test that the testsuite passes and the documentation builds correctly?
