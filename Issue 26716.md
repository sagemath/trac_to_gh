CC:  embray chapoton

On a python3-only system its likely that there is no python command, since PEP394 argues for /usr/bin/python to be python2 only for now. In particular, the Debian 10 buildbot doesn't have python (since it uses python3 buildbot). 

The problem is that our sage-system-python script only looks for python, it should fall back to python3
