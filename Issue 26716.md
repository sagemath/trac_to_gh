On a python3-only system its likely that there is no python command, since PEP394 argues for /usr/bin/python to be python2 only for now. In particular, the Debian 10 buildbot doesn't have python (since it uses python3 buildbot). 

The problem is that our sage-system-python script only looks for python, it should fall back to python3

I would've just checked for python3 first, but we can try it like this for now; it doesn't matter much I don't think since the build tools ostensibly support both Python 2 and 3.
