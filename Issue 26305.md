One failure:

```
File "src/sage/combinat/root_system/dynkin_diagram.py", line 545, in sage.combinat.root_system.dynkin_diagram.DynkinDiagram_class.relabel
Failed example:
    Dp = D.relabel({-1:4, 0:-3, 1:3, 2:2}); Dp
Expected:
    O---X---O---O
    4   -3  3   2
    A1|2 relabelled by {0: -3, 1: 3, 2: 2, -1: 4}
Got:
    O---X---O---O
    4   -3  3   2   
    A1|2 relabelled by {-1: 4, 0: -3, 1: 3, 2: 2}
```

Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
