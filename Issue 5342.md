The subscription mechanism on the wiki does not work. 

It used to be a convenient way of getting information about updates on interesting pages. Looking at the `RecentChanges` page every once in a while doesn't work well. 


```
<mabs|4666> Just open a trac ticket and assign it to mhansen.
<mabs|4666> He is only dealing with 35 tickets and 20 MB diffs :)
<burcin> I'm sure he appreciates your support :)

...
<mabs|4666> Yep, make it an issue for all wikis.
<mabs|4666> or at least mpir, l-functions and sage
