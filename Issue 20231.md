some problems (about future transition to py3) can be found using

```
python -Qwarnall $(which sage-runtests) src/sage/combinat/*.py 
```


let us try to correct a few of them.

Since you're changing it, you might as well do:

```diff
-while len(roots):
+while roots:
```

Once you make those changes, you can set it to a positive review.

General suggestion: add `from __future__ import division` on top of modules which have been fully converted. That way we know for sure that there are no old-style divisions left in that module.
