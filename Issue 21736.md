# Issue 21736: is_negative() is False when assuming x < 0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: is_negative

I understand the `is_negative` flag is still experimental.  I just document it here, and mention that `is_positive` does work as expected when assuming x > 0.
Here's an example:

```python
sage: var('x,y')
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: assume(y<0)
sage: x.is_positive()
True
sage: x.is_negative()
False
```


Tested on 7.5.beta4.
