A while-we-are-at-it thing, to improve the speed a bit: I would change

```python
    r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
    if weight is None or r.weight() == _Partitions(weight):
        yield r
    while st_next(st):
        r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
        if weight is None or r.weight() == _Partitions(weight):
            yield skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
```

to

```python
    if weight is None:
        yield skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
        while st_next(st):
        r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
        if weight is None or r.weight() == _Partitions(weight):
            yield skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
    else:
        wt = _Partitions(weight)
        r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
        if r.weight() == wt:
            yield r
        while st_next(st):
            r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
            if r.weight() == wt:
                yield r
```

LGTM otherwise.
