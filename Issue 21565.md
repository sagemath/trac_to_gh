Why the dependency on #21779?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-11-02 21:21:57

because I am using the brand new richcmp_not_equal

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-02 21:42:45

In that case, the branch should actually be based on top of #21779.

there remains some problems with toric morphisms

As in the other ticket, you should use

```
left = <FastDoubleFunc?>self
right = <FastDoubleFunc?>other
```

instead of

```
left, right = self, other
```

to check that the type is correct.
