If a symbolic expression contains Â symbolic derivative then
checking whether it is zero, raises error:

```
sage: x.diff(x,2).is_zero()
True

sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: f(x).diff(x).is_zero()
....
NotImplementedError: derivative
```


This fails because new symbolics tries to convert it to maxima
expression for checking the relation.

It works fine for any other expression not involving symbolic
derivative and without invoking maxima.

It seems to me, pynac relational test needs to be fixed.

Unfortunately, the fact that an expression contains a symbolic derivative doesn't guarantee that it is nonzero:


```
sage: t = f(x).derivative(x)
sage: (x*t +(1-x)*t - t)
-(x - 1)*D[1](f)(x) + x*D[1](f)(x) - D[1](f)(x)
sage: (x*t +(1-x)*t - t).collect(x)
0
```


The right fix for this is to either implement the `.derivative()` method in `sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py` or to change pynac to allow different parents in `evalf()`, so that conversion to `CIF` can be done without the code in `expression_conversions.pyx`. 

I was planning to do this for #6243, but ended up using a different/better fix there.

This is fixed by #7490, since we don't use the `expression_conversions` module to convert to `RIF` any more.
