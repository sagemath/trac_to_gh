# Issue 14538: move cygwin rebase scripts to SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin

Keywords: cygwin rebase, easy

currently the scripts from #14031 are not readily available at build-time. They should be moved to 
`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin`.

I'm not sure this still makes sense with the new git layout as src is always available (and spkg/ does not exists).

The scripts are in `src/bin` and available at build time. Close ticket?
