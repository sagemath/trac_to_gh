Posets included in `poset_examples.py` are not consistent as to whether they provide a `facade` option. They probably should be.

Not relating to this, but isn't `IntegerCompositions` a lattice? As other examples return lattice instead of (only) poset, this should propably be corrected too. Maybe it fits to this ticket too.

Changing priority from major to minor.

Nothing very important, but being consistent is usually a good idea.

I'm ok with all the changes that were made, but I think it probably makes sense to add facade options to *all* posets in `poset_examples.py` in this ticket, rather than dragging it out over multiple tickets (it will also make it clear for the future that having a facade option is "the convention").

True, but this ticket at least do some of them, and is mergeable. The bigger the patch, the bigger change to have a collision.

Just pinging... Is it possible to review this one, and come back to other poset examples later?
