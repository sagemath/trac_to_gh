Keywords: deformation theory, plane curves

Let `C` be a plane projective curves over a finite field `k` and `S` a finite set of `k`-sections of the projective plane. It would be nice if Sage could compute a lifting of the plane curve to a `p`-adic ring `R` (with finite precision) and liftings of the `k`-sections to `R`-sections of the projective plane such that the multiplicity of `C` at the `i`-th section is the same as the multplicity of the lifting at the lifted section.

REFEREE REPORT:

It looks good!

More precisely, I (William Stein) read the code for style, and Max Leiblich (an algebraic geometer) read the code for the mathematics, and we both agree it looks good.

Well, there is one unusual thing.  There are backslashes in the comments so they occupy less than 80 characters, but when read, are wide.  I've never seen this before anywhere in Sage/Python code.  I'm not sure whether we should allow it or not.  I'll leave this to the release manager.

I agree, the backslashes is a very strange thing, I wouldn't do that.

Also, never use

```
except:
```

without specifying an exception class, as it will catch stuff like `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Raising exceptions should be done in a Python 3 compatible way: `raise TypeError("string")` and you should add doctests for the exceptions also.
