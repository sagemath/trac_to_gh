# Issue 17914: Fix bug with hyperbolicity

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This patch fixes two problems with the hyperbolicity function, one due to the decomposition into bi-connected components (the result was divided by two), and one due to the declaration as `int` of some variables.

Still another bug: David, if I use the algorithm 'cuts+' instead of 'cuts', with the same code I gave you and the same input, the algorithm outputs a lot of times the following lines.


```
The approximation_factor is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm. 
The additive_gap is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm.

```

I tried many other inputs, and it worked flawlessly. Any clue?

Right :(
This is because the function calls itself and tests again the inputs.
I don't know how to proceed here.
Nathann: any idea?

Yes -> raise an exception instead of printing a warning `:-P`

I did so. It's the easiest way to fix the problem. I have also updated some tests.
