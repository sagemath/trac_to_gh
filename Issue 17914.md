CC:  ncohen borassi

This patch fixes two problems with the hyperbolicity function, one due to the decomposition into bi-connected components (the result was divided by two), and one due to the declaration as `int` of some variables.

Still another bug: David, if I use the algorithm 'cuts+' instead of 'cuts', with the same code I gave you and the same input, the algorithm outputs a lot of times the following lines.


```
The approximation_factor is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm. 
The additive_gap is ignored when using the 'cuts+' algorithm.

```

I tried many other inputs, and it worked flawlessly. Any clue?

This is because the function calls itself and tests again the inputs.
