There exists a functionality to check for hermation matrixes with ` is_hermation()` which returns true or false. Can we add the functionality to check for the skew hermation, with `is_skhermation()` ??

As suggested, I have added a private method `_is_hermitian` which accepts a flag `skew` to check whether the matrix is (skew-)Hermitian, following the conventions from Matlab:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ishermitian.html

The private method is then dispatched by the public functions `is_hermitian` and `is_skew_hermitian`.
