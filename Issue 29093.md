# Issue 29093: checking for skew_hermation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29330

Original creator: @Shlokatadistance

Original creation time: 2020-03-14 10:22:01

There exists a functionality to check for hermation matrixes with ` is_hermation()` which returns true or false. Can we add the functionality to check for the skew hermation, with `is_skhermation()` ??

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Perhaps a more knowledgeable sage developer will say differently, but, to avoid code redundancy, I would suggest modifying the definition of `is_hermitian` to define a private method `_is_hermitian(self, skew)`, so that `is_hermitian(self)` can be defined as `_is_hermitian(self, False)` and `is_skew_hermitian` can be defined as `_is_hermitian(self, True)`. It should be possible to do this by adding a few if statements and minus signs. Of course, the new routines will need doctests, but the docstring of `is_hermitian` might not require any revision at all.

Note that `is_hermitian` is defined in `src/sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` and `src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx`, so `is_skew_hermitian` should be added to both files. (The version in `matrix_double_dense.pyx` has additional parameters.)

As suggested, I have added a private method `_is_hermitian` which accepts a flag `skew` to check whether the matrix is (skew-)Hermitian, following the conventions from Matlab:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ishermitian.html

The private method is then dispatched by the public functions `is_hermitian` and `is_skew_hermitian`.

I reviewed the code and everything seems fine. Also, I ran "make ptestlong" and all the tests passed.
