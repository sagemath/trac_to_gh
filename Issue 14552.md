I took out routines dealing with fundamental domains and reduction and inserted them into ticket 14978 which depends on ticket 14977 which implements base classes for Hilbert modular groups.
There are also failing doctests to be fixed.

We are currently working with the git branch. But if this ticket is finished before the switch to git happens, then we can always manually create a new patch file with the differences, so I don't see the need of bumping it all the way to sage-6.0.

We were too ambitious in trying to put the general case over number fields in there all at once. In the mean time, others managed to put the case of QQ in [SageMath](SageMath), so if we ever continue with this ticket, then we should also take into account #21248.
