The example for Thue-Morse word factor complexity is not correct. For length = 18, you should find 52 factors and for length 19, you should have 56 factors. You can find these factors in the prefix of length 1000. 

Note that there are some trailing spaces (occurring in both complexities) that should be removed.

Note that INPUT and OUTPUT blocks are also missing. See [General Conventions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content).
