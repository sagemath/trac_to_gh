This works pretty well already (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/492908952?check_suite_focus=true)

Issues:
- `configure` is run a second time at the beginning of `make`
- a non-Cygwin `python` is in `PATH` and is picked up by `sage-system-python`. This should really be fixed by #29090 ("configure forgets to check whether ANY Python is available on the system").

maybe it's just a forgotten Cygwin package:
