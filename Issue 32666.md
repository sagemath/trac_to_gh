Before:


```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 10)
sage: %timeit M.row(3)
4.86 µs ± 22.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit M.column(3)
4.76 µs ± 19 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 100)
sage: %timeit M.row(3)
20.2 µs ± 853 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit M.column(3)
21.9 µs ± 4.72 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```


After:


```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 10)
sage: %timeit M.row(3)
1.04 µs ± 1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit M.column(3)
990 ns ± 1.42 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ, 100)
sage: %timeit M.row(3)
7.37 µs ± 6.97 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit M.column(3)
7.33 µs ± 5.79 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

I think this should be `ZZ`?


```
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 3, 2, [1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 0])
```
