- A surface mesh data structure representing vertices (0D), edges (1D), and faces (2D) along with edge lengths that obey triangle inequality
- Treat surface mesh as simplicial complex by forgetting edge length data
- Computation of dual mesh. 
- Computation of hodge dual of (k-forms) from the dual mesh.
- Computation of discrete laplacian from the mesh.
- Solutions to the heat and wave equation in terms of the discrete laplacian
