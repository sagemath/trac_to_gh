# Issue 29328: Migrate neighborly to combinatorial polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29565

Keywords: neighborly polytopes

We migrate `is_neighborly` and `neighborliness` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.
It is also faster now, as use the f-vector instead of indirectly getting the number of k-faces.

Along the way we add `is_simplex` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and cache the methods `f_vector` and `n_vertices`.

* I would suggest adding the definitions of "k-neighborly" and "neighborly" instead of referring to Wikipedia. 

* The sentence for the d-simplex is not a definition. It is just an example. So why should it be mentioned? 

*

```diff
-        - ``True`` if the every set of up to ``k`` vertices forms a face,
+        - ``True`` if every set of up to ``k`` vertices forms a face
```

Small coding style:


```diff
+    @cached_method
+    def neighborliness(self):
+        r"""
-        Returns the largest ``k``, such that the polyhedron is ``k``-neighborly.
+        Return the largest ``k``, such that the polyhedron is ``k``-neighborly.
```


You can put this on positive review on my behalf once this is fixed.
