See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.html -- links in TOC are not links.

The links work for me (Firefox 69.0.2 on Mac OS 10.13.6).

I don't see the links either. Changing `~posets` to `~Posets` in each reference fixes it for me.

Ah, that was it. Then also `src/sage/categories/posets.py` needs correction. Can you do that too in this ticket?

I think those are actually different problems. `sage/categories/posets.py` just looks like a mistake, whereas `sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.py` should have worked, since the file says `posets = Posets` at the bottom, and in a Sage session, `posets.DiamondPoset()` works. (In comparison, from the categories file, `posets.ParentMethods...` doesn't work.) Here is a fix for that file, too, though.
