CC:  tscrim vbraun wstein

With this branch, the doc of `WittDesign` changes from:


```
   INPUT:

   * "n" is in 9,10,11,12,21,22,23,24.

   Wraps GAP Design's WittDesign. If "n=24" then this function returns
   the large Witt design W_{24}, the unique (up to isomorphism)
...
```


to


```
This method soon will not be available in that way anymore. To use it,
you can now call it by typing designs.WittDesign

Is there a way to do something similar for functions like `sage.coding.code_constructions.cyclotomic_cosets`? Otherwise, the patch looks good to me.

Hmmmm.. There is something called `deprecated_function_alias` but it does not work when the arguments are not the same. For this, we would need a decorator to deprecate a function with a given warning.
