Several compiler warnings show up when compiling the Cython files in `src/sage/libs/pari`. These can easily be fixed.

Weird. This removes the warnings, but adds some more:

What am I doing wrong?

I am only dealing with warnings inside `src/sage/libs/pari`. Are you saying that this branch adds *new* warnings in files like `sage/rings/bernmm/bern_modp.cpp`?

To be sure, test like this:

```
./sage -b    # Make sure that everything is up-to-date before testing this branch
touch src/sage/libs/pari/*.pyx
./sage -b    # Recompile only the PARI files
```

I'm saying that the head commit adds those three warnings. I did


```
git checkout HEAD^
make build
git checkout t/21705/ticket/21705
make build
```


and looked at the diff between the two logs. Oddly enough, many more things (59 modules) got recompiled this way, then by just touching.

You really need to start from a known state, so you omitted an important part: what happened before the `git checkout HEAD^`?

If you really want to diff logs, you should do:

```
export MAKE="make -j1"   # Build serially to have reproducible logs
git checkout t/21705/ticket/21705
make build               # Put the build in a known state, ignore this log
git checkout HEAD^
make build &>log1
git checkout t/21705/ticket/21705
make build &>log2
```

and then compare `log1` and `log2`.

I just did that, you will see that no new warnings appear.

I had made this branch, yes. But you are right, I forgot about `-j1`. I did what you just suggested, and I confirm there are no new warnings.
