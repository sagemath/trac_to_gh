Salut Marc,

In `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py`:


```diff
-by trac ticket #9944, poynomial rings are equal if and only
-if they are identic (which should be the case for all parent
+by trac ticket #9944, polynomial rings are equal if and only
+if they are identical (which should be the case for all parent
```


Should'nt the formatting be `by :trac:`9944`` instead of `by trac ticket #9944`?
