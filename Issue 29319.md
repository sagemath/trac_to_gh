Here are some minimal changes. I think we should also add a homebrew section to the file `source.rst`. I can work on that, but should it be on this ticket or another one?

I'm putting the proposed homebrew section at #29558.

There are also some links to the wiki that point to outdated trash pages.

I'd say `**python**: Python >= 3.6, or Python 2.7 (deprecated)`  - we do not want to give an impression we commit to Python 2 in any way.

The precise list of versions that we claim to support for sage-system-python can be found in build/tox.ini: py26, py27, py33, py34, py35, py36, py37, py38
