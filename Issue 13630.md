The linestyle argument is inconsistent across plots, as already pointed out in #13423. It seems this is spread out throughout many Sage components including `sage.plot.*` and `sage.graphs.graph_plot`.

This [patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/13834/trac_13834_enable_short_linestyle.patch) should enable short matplotlib linestyle keywords like ':' od '--' for arc, arrow, bezier_path, circle and ellipse. Up to now only long linestyle were available.

Furthermore worng linestyle keywords now should lead to a Warning that the linestyle is unknown and ignored but the object is nevertheless plotted with the default linestyle.

Hello, Thanks for looking into this ticket. I will be able to do a more thorough review only later this week. With a casual look at the patch, I have the following comments about the formatting.

Hi

thanks for the extensive improvements!

I did the following in order to test the patches:

```
$ ./sage --testall --long
all tests passed
```

```
/sage -docbuild reference html
```
Built without errors or warnings

checked coverage of changed files:
There are only some old missing coverages in hyperbolic_arc and hyperbolic_triangle. But I'm not sure how one should test them reasonably.

The only thing which seems to be a little bit unlogical for me is:

```
        301         Linestyles with ``"default"`` or ``"steps"`` in them should also be 
 	302	    properly handled.  For instance, matplotlib understands only the short 
 	303	    version when ``"steps"`` is used:: 
 	304	 
 	305	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("default", "short") 
 	306	        '' 
 	307	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("steps--", "short") 
 	308	        'steps--' 
 	309	        sage: get_matplotlib_linestyle("steps-predashed", "long") 
 	310	        'steps-pre--' 
```

Wouldn't the following be more reasonable: If matplotlib in some functions only understand linestyles "stepsdashed" the function get_matplotlib_linestyle should be called with the "short" keyword (as you do it in lines.py) but the keyword shouldn't be ignored in the function itself. But I don't see that this makes any problems so its just a question.

I also tried to play with the enhanced functions and encountered no further problems.

In any case: Since I'm inexperienced someone more experienced should have a final look in order to confirm the patches.

Since `get_matplotlib_linestyle` is an internal function I just made it silently output the correct result even on incorrect input. maptlotlib understands only the short form in those cases and so I think it is safe to output the short form always when we know that there is no alternative.

Thanks for checking them. I had checked some but not all.
