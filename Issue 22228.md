# Issue 22228: Doctest continuation marker / several files / 3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22465

This is the last patch about doctest continuation markers at `src/sage`. (There are some left at `src/doc`.)

In few cases this corrects a bug where a doctest does not really check for right output.

Is it possible to forbid old-style continuation markers? That would prevent some doctest errors.

I am happy with this, assuming that the patchbots do not complain.
