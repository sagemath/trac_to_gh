# Issue 22770: Remove "public" from methods where it is not needed

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-05-15 21:27:10

Various methods in `src/sage/rings/fast_arith.pyx` and in `src/sage/libs/ntl` are declared as `cdef public` but there is no reason for that. To make it easier to identify the cases where the `cdef public` does matter, we remove those unneeded `cdef public` declarations.

LGTM. Trivial PEP8 nitpick:

```diff
-    cdef public long long c_xgcd_longlong(self, long long a, long long b,
-                                          long long *ss,
-                                          long long *tt) except -1
+    cdef long long c_xgcd_longlong(self, long long a, long long b,
+                                   long long *ss,
+                                   long long *tt) except -1
```
