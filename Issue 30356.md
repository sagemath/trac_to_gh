please identify the Xcode version and OS more precisely. I don't need this patch with Xcode 12.0 on macOS 10.15.6.

should not be a blocker, as non-beta Xcode is OK, still.

Changing priority from blocker to critical.

I think you've clarified this on another ticket, but for the record (and anyone else who might be reading), this is with Xcode 12.0, OS X 10.15.6 (Catalina, not the prerelease of Big Sur). So an official release of Xcode on a current Mac OS, not beta.
