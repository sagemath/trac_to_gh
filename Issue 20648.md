Normaliz is an excellent library for computations in affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones. There's a command-line program and a library (libnormaliz).

We already have normaliz as an optional package. Now an interface (either to the program or the library) needs to be developed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20885

I've removed information that no longer applies
and removed the change log because to my understanding we no longer do change logs but rather rely on git history for packages.
