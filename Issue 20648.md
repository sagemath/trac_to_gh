Normaliz is an excellent library for computations in affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones. There's a command-line program and a library (libnormaliz).

We already have normaliz as an optional package. Now an interface (either to the program or the library) needs to be developed.

Why did you remove the content of SPKG.txt (commit `5e87434`)?

Why don't you provide a package for pynormaliz? Downloading a non-specified version from github looks sloppy to me.

I've removed information that no longer applies
and removed the change log because to my understanding we no longer do change logs but rather rely on git history for packages.

Yes, will do when it has stabilized.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I was able to install everything without problems and run some examples (such as my E<sub>8</sub> polytope, which runs in under 150ms compared to 12+s without this interface). I made some reviewer changes to the documentation. The setup for the spkgs LGTM. I'm willing to set a positive review, provided my changes are good, but I would appreciate if someone else looked over the packaging side of things.

These changes are fine with me.

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-12-11 16:03:35

All the info regarding how to create the Sage package from the sources seems to be gone now. Can it be put back (suitably updated)?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-12-11 16:30:05

It's using the upstream distributions. No repackaging involved.

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-12-11 16:33:12

ok, good.
