# Issue 12827: Color('red') > Color('red') returns True

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12999

Keywords: sd40.5


```
sage: Color('red') > Color('red')
True
sage: Color('red') > Color('yellow')
True
```

This seems weird.  Especially in view of #11383 (to which this is a followup), maybe these should all be `False`.

As discussed, `3<=3` so the same should be true for colors.
