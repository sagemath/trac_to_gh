# Issue 29565: Minimum of Infinity and a real variable not commutative

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29802

Original creator: alexjbest

Original creation time: 2020-06-05 04:02:04

Keywords: symbolics, infinity, minimum, maximum

On 9.2beta0

```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: min(a,+Infinity)
a
sage: min(+Infinity,a)
+Infinity
```

returning a in both cases would be best, but at the very worst this should consistently throw an error imo.

This is Python's built-in min. Try `min_symbolic`

`@`mkoeppe, thanks, sorry for the noise, I searched pretty hard for this information (using Google and trac search). I wonder how we could make this information more discoverable?

Perhaps adding a `min` method to `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` to compute the minimum of `self` and `other` in this way?

Changing component from symbolics to documentation.

Changing priority from major to minor.

I am pretty sure we tried doing something along the lines of making this easier to find, but apparently not.  For instance, it could be useful in plot documentation too - see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/4FIp2Qczx40/r2n4sC70uu4J).

See also:
* #26650
* [reference manual](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/functions/sage/functions/min_max.html)

As for the suggestion, are there any other [builtins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that we are able to treat in this manner?  Other than things like `repr() = __repr__()`?  I don't see anything about `min` or `max` [in the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization) on custom classes.  The actual CPython source seems to implement a generic function that then gets a max via gt and min via lt, but I don't see an easy way (or desire) to hack this.  Unfortunately improving doc - a lot - may be the best way to handle this.  (I don't immediately see how the `key` argument would solve this, for instance.)

Interestingly, we actually do do this for `abs` (see [builtins list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs)), and it causes a problem, because 

```
sage: abs?
Signature:      abs(x, /)
Docstring:      Return the absolute value of the argument.
Init docstring: Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
File:           
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
```

But presumably we want something more than that, such as the content [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/functions/other.py?id=7cef50b2542c2b90e8a60b88beb6fc6d09d0d380#n44).  I'm not sure why this is what is returned.

Anyway - maybe that means we _can_ overload `min`/`max` somehow, maybe even as naively as for `abs`.  Though note comment:2:ticket:6949.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
