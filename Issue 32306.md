The failures not already marked as `not tested` can be reproduced with


```
sage -t --long --random-seed=278359527985830794615851381295249030671 src/sage/schemes/toric/sheaf/klyachko.py  # 3 doctests failed

This ticket seems to be ignored by Volker's merging script

That's because I messed up on #29956.

This ticket here should have been a dependency of #29956. It's only commit is part of #29956.

So move this to `duplicate/won't fix`?
