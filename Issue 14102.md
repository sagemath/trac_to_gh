in our book we originally had the example in the description (at that time we were using Sage 5.1) but
we had to change the last equation from `x*y*z^4==6` to `x*y*z^4==3` to get Sage to really solve the system (the final version of the book is based on Sage 5.9).

With `x*y*z^4==6` as last equation, Sage 6.2 is still unable to solve the system as Sage 5.1 did in the description, thus the problem is still open for me.

yes we don't need this (with `x*y*z^4==6`) for the current version of our book.
But it would be good to add this as a doctest, to check the Maxima fix remains ok.
