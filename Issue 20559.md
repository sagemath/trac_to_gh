You have changed `while len(current_layer) > 0:` to `while len(current_layer):`. It is OK, but isn't the Python way just `while current_layer:`?

IMO there should be a dot after "Install database_gap first. See optional packages".

There is an `'` at "Gel'fand", I don't know why.

Tests passed on modified files.
