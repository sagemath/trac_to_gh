Tests look good; and even the usual cygwin segfaults on plotting are gone. (But we had sporadic success of the cygwin CI before, so we cannot be sure yet that this ticket fixed it.)

Ready for review.

I wonder whether this plays along with SciPy we ship well, or we should bump SciPy too.

OK, SciPy will get updated on #32105

Our scipy 1.6.3 declares that it is compatible with:

```
    numpy>=1.16.5,<1.23.0
```

... so yes, our current version is compatible with this update.
