I don't mind if this ticket gets put straight back to positive, but perhaps you can check:

On #624 there is mention of a special option for Cython that is required. If we're ripping the whole in-place stuff out, we can probably also get rid of this Cython option. Since that should save an incref/decref it might lead to slightly faster code. Might be worth looking at?

hm, the relevant option seems to be `--incref-local-binop`, which by the looks of it was already disabled on #3331. So we're probably good. Can someone confirm?

Grepping both the Cython and Sage source code for `incref-local-binop` yielded no matches, so it looks good indeed.
