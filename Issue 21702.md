Solving an equation which only involves `x`, with respect to `y`, gives a solution with respect to `x`:

```python
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: solve(x > 0, y)
[[x > 0]]
```

(Expected answer: for all `y`...)

It does not change if one adds `y` to the equation in a dummy way (like `y*0`).

Similarly, the following code:

```python
solve(1>x*0, y)
```

returns `[[]]`, where the expected result should probably be for all `y`. For the second example `sympy` returns `True`.
