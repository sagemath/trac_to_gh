Keywords: beginner, typo, symbolics

The docstring of `_repr_Expression` in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` says:

```
13456    cpdef _repr_Expression(x):
13457        r"""
13458        Return the string representation of the eexpression ``x``.
```


It should say 'expression' instead of 'eexpression'.

It looks like you forked the entire repo and tried to make changes there so, presumably, you could start a PR. I don't think that's the process.
