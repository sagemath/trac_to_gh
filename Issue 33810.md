# Issue 33810: Typo in _repr_Expression in symbolic/expression.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34047

Original creator: @utkarsh314

Original creation time: 2022-06-21 18:10:19

Keywords: beginner, typo, symbolics

The docstring of `_repr_Expression` in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` says:

```
13456    cpdef _repr_Expression(x):
13457        r"""
13458        Return the string representation of the eexpression ``x``.
```


It should say 'expression' instead of 'eexpression'.

I fixed the typo and pushed the changes to the fork on my Github.

This is my first attempt at a pull request. Any feedback would be much appreciated!

It looks like you forked the entire repo and tried to make changes there so, presumably, you could start a PR. I don't think that's the process.

I think the build failed for reasons outside of my control.
