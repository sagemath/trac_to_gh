# Issue 12646: Building polybori under FreeBSD

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12818

Original creator: stephen

Original creation time: 2012-04-08 14:56:50

Assignee: tbd

CC:  alexanderdreyer

Keywords: FreeBSD polybori

I need this patch to build under FreeBSD:


```
--- src/polybori-0.8.0/Cudd/cudd/cudd.h-orig	2012-02-09 03:18:02.000000000 +0000
+++ src/polybori-0.8.0/Cudd/cudd/cudd.h	2012-02-09 03:19:20.000000000 +0000
@@ -82,6 +82,12 @@
 
 #endif
 
+#ifdef __cplusplus
+#include <cstdio>
+#else
+#include <stdio.h>
+#endif
+
 #ifdef __cplusplus
 extern "C" {
 #endif
```


This patch should be harmless to all builds under other OS.

Is there an ETA on when that will be in Sage, or should we try to make an spkg update?

Meanwhile the new spkg is at #13124. Feel free to try it out. If it solves you problem, this one may be considered as a duplicate of #13124.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I can confirm that the patch in question is included in #13124.  Since this is definitely the only thing from [the FreeBSD port list](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/math/sage/files/) from polybori, I think that we can close this ticket.

I can confirm that ticket #13124 fixes this problem for FreeBSD.
