One possible obstruction for the change `Py_ssize_t` -> `size_t` is that matrices can be accessed with negative indices. Perhaps it is not so dramatic. However, if this change happend we want to do it coherently with vectors, etc.

For the other proposition, calling properly LinBox with casting where necessary do not look too ugly for me. We can arrange so that it only appears in the code at `sage/libs/linbox/`.

`@`Clement: note that in LinBox the function is declared as (`linbox/algorithms/gauss.h` line 227)

```C++
// Sparsest method
//   erases elements while computing rank/det.
template <class _Matrix>                                      
unsigned long& InPlaceLinearPivoting(unsigned long &rank,

Here I don't understand why `rank`, `Ni` and `Nj` are not `size_t` as they should rather be.

Good news: tests pass on 32 bits.

`@`vinklein: can you test one more time on OSX?

If everything went fine on OSX, I think we should get this ticket merged as is. I will change `unsigned long` to `size_t` as soon as LinBox gets updated.
