# Issue 22977: solving integer sparse linear system using LinBox

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23214

LinBox has very efficient algorithms to solve linear systems. This ticket provides the necessary interface for solving sparse systems over integers.

Just to put in a plug for this, it would be very useful for various aspects of number theory, particularly dealing with Hecke operators which tend to be represented by sparse integer matrices.

And combinatorics and geomtry and ... just waiting for upstream [github issue 56](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/56).

Comment by roed created at 2017-11-05 07:37:13

That issue has been closed.  Are we waiting on a release?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2017-11-05 09:20:34

Indeed, Cl√©ment wrote on the github issue

```
Note that we're also planning on releasing all 3 libraries
soon (within a few weeks), and I'll create a sage ticket
for updating the spkg.
```

FYI LinBox upgrade ticket is #24214.
Current ticket already depends on it by transitivity with #23158.

This hangs forever

```
sage: m = diagonal_matrix(ZZ, 68, [2]*66 + [1,1])
sage: type(m)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse'>
sage: m.det()
```

Oops, I got this confused with the other needs review linbox ticket where compiling on OSX was an issue, I'll try them both out together now I guess.

Small typo (missing leading colon): `meth:`sage.matrix.matrix_sparse.Matrix_sparse.charpoly`` Otherwise I am happy with the current state (and will assume there are no failures on OSX).

This compile failure can be reproduced outside of sage. Issue opened on upstream [linbox/issues/138](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/138).

As mentionned in [linbox/issues/138](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/138), passing a long instead of a size_t to BlasVector constructor is causing an weird type resolution problem, which I can still not fully understand.
Meanwhile 2 options can fix the problem:
 - have sage cython code send size_t parameters to LinBox, as required by the interface. This means doing explicit casts (inelegant) or changing the type of ncols and nrows in matrix classes (heavy change)
 - removing the templated constructor in LinBox::BlasVector that is in the way. This change is not harmfull for the library, but it feels not right to remove features for some weird type resolution issue on OSX due to sage not respecting the interface. This second option would also delay the fixing of this issue to the integration of the next release of LinBox or patching sage's LinBox.

One possible obstruction for the change `Py_ssize_t` -> `size_t` is that matrices can be accessed with negative indices. Perhaps it is not so dramatic. However, if this change happend we want to do it coherently with vectors, etc.

For the other proposition, calling properly LinBox with casting where necessary do not look too ugly for me. We can arrange so that it only appears in the code at `sage/libs/linbox/`.

We have almost the same error but for `matrix_modn_sparse`.

There was indeed some casts missing. I pushed a fixed and checked that all casts have been done.

Tests are still running on OSX. That mean off course that all compilation problems are solved.

I get 5 errors on OSX:

sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.pyx  # 3 doctests failed
```

`matrix_modn_sparse.pyx` errors are the sames as the patchbot ones and the two others are not ticket dependent (see Justin C. Walker message in [Sage 8.5.beta1 released](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-release/yiJTgNhjB6o) ).

There seems to be a test failure on one of the patchbots:

This concerns `petitbonum` and, on the other hand, everything is fine on `pc78-math`.

I can not reproduce either.

`@`Cl√©ment: any clue of what might be wrong on 32 bit architecture?

`@`Clement: note that in LinBox the function is declared as (`linbox/algorithms/gauss.h` line 227)

```C++
// Sparsest method
//   erases elements while computing rank/det.
template <class _Matrix>                                      
unsigned long& InPlaceLinearPivoting(unsigned long &rank,
                                     Element& determinant,
                                     _Matrix        &A,
                                     unsigned long Ni,
                                     unsigned long Nj) const;
```

Here I don't understand why `rank`, `Ni` and `Nj` are not `size_t` as they should rather be.

I filled the [Issue 144](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/144) on linbox website.

Good news: tests pass on 32 bits.

`@`vinklein: can you test one more time on OSX?

If everything went fine on OSX, I think we should get this ticket merged as is. I will change `unsigned long` to `size_t` as soon as LinBox gets updated.

This is also good on my machine and on a 32 and 64 bit patchbot.

I strongly suspect that this ticket caused #28586 (breakage in solving sparse linear systems over prime fields), as it was the most substantial related change that got in in Sage 8.5.beta3. (and I bisected #28586 to 8.5.beta3).
