for integers mod n there is a `rational_reconstruction` method:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(97)
sage: a = R(2) / R(3)
sage: a.rational_reconstruction()
2/3
```

However for polynomials the corresponding method is named
`rational_reconstruct`:

```
sage: K.<x> = R[]            
sage: x.rational_reconstruct(x,4,4)
(0, 1)
```

The naming is incoherent.

The added method

```diff
+    def rational_reconstruction(self, *args, **kwargs):
+        r"""
+        Compute a rational reconstruction of this polynomial quotient
+        ring element to its parent.
+
+        This method is a thin convenience wrapper around
+        :meth:`Polynomial.rational_reconstruction`.
+
+        EXAMPLES::
+
+            sage: R.<x> = GF(65537)[]
+            sage: m = x^11 + 25345*x^10 + 10956*x^9 + 13873*x^8 + 23962*x^7 + 17496*x^6 + 30348*x^5 + 7440*x^4 + 65438*x^3 + 7676*x^2 + 54266*x + 47805
+            sage: f = 20437*x^10 + 62630*x^9 + 63241*x^8 + 12820*x^7 + 42171*x^6 + 63091*x^5 + 15288*x^4 + 32516*x^3 + 2181*x^2 + 45236*x + 2447
+            sage: f_mod_m = R.quotient(m)(f)
+            sage: f_mod_m.rational_reconstruction()
+            (51388*x^5 + 29141*x^4 + 59341*x^3 + 7034*x^2 + 14152*x + 23746,
+             x^5 + 15208*x^4 + 19504*x^3 + 20457*x^2 + 11180*x + 28352)
+        """
+        m = self.parent().modulus()
+        R = m.parent()
+        f = R(self._polynomial)
+        return f.lift().rational_reconstruction(m, *args, **kwargs)
```

doesn't work for me. The example fails. Is `.lift()` necessary? 

In the header of the docstring, "to its parent" seems wrong. You meant P for the quotient ring P/m? I think it is called "cover (ring)" but I am not sure. Certainly it is not "parent".

Indeed, thanks. (I'm sure I had fixed the `.lift()` call at some point, but apparently that change didn't make it into the commit...)
