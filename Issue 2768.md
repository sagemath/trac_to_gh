Some timings:

original

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: eq=x<y
sage: %timeit eq(x=2, y=3)
10 loops, best of 3: 54.6 Âµs per loop
```

fast_float (after applying patch)

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: eq=x<y
sage: f=eq._fast_float_('x','y')
sage: %timeit f(2,3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 422 ns per loop
```
and even with the overhead of converting back to bool

```
sage: %timeit bool(f(2,3))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 721 ns per loop
```

One more comparison:

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: x._fast_float_('x')
<sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc object at 0xa02a95c>
sage: f=x._fast_float_('x')
sage: g=y._fast_float_('y')
sage: f(2)<g(3)
True
sage: %timeit f(2)<g(3)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 723 ns per loop
```

So this could have been implemented without touching the fast_float code.  However, if I want just the floating point 0.0 and 1.0 values, this patch still wins.

The code is nice and clean, but I don't think it should be applied. Expressions and equations are not interchangeable, and this can lead to some strange results. 

```
sage: f = (x == 1)
sage: g = (1 == x)
sage: bool(f+g)
True
sage: ff = f._fast_float_('x') + g._fast_float_('x')
sage: ff(0)
0.0
sage: ff(1)
2.0
sage: ff(2)
0.0
sage: list(ff)
['load 0', 'push 1.0', 'eq', 'push 1.0', 'load 0', 'eq', 'add']
```

Really, I think what should be implemented is piecewise functions for fast float, which would allow one to do things like #2770 nicely. One could also create a specialized wrapper that could handle the semantics of the two sides of the equations correctly (and maybe even do short-circuiting on the first false expression).
