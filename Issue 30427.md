What error did you see with `./bootstrap`? I tested it with every shell available to me, in a clean tree (after `git clean -x -f -d`).

Probably related: those two occurrences of `source` should be `.` instead. And we should be doing `test -f <file> && . <file>` instead of `2>/dev/null` so that we don't hide other, unexpected errors.

I can't reproduce that with dash, bash, ksh, zsh, or posh. If you drop the `2>/dev/null`, what goes wrong? (What shell are you using?)

The `source` is a bashism so I would think it fails there, but I don't know why it wouldn't proceed. In any case, changing those lines to `-f <file> && . <file>` will avoid the failure.

I can't explain this, but when my `/bin/sh` points to `/bin/zsh` and I run the bootstrap script, it fails. If I run `zsh ./bootstrap -d` instead, it works fine -- so whatever I was doing to test was flawed. At first I thought zsh was looking at the shebang and re-executing the script with `/bin/sh`... but `/bin/sh` is still zsh!

Whatever is happening there, your branch fixes the problem. Look good on your end too?

Is there are make target to remove `src/bin/sage-env-config` without running `./boostrap` ?
I could not find one, and this is a problem - `./bootstrap` can fail on a stale `sage-env-config`.
