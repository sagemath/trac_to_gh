# Issue 17515: finite_state_module: Update references

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17752

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2015-02-09 09:21:02

CC:  skropf dkrenn

Keywords: references

Update reference `[HKP2014]`.

Move reference `[HKW2014]` to a global "References" block in the header of the file because it is referenced in different methods, see the [discussion on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/a6oLiXvEtMc/WCu78VOuoOIJ).
