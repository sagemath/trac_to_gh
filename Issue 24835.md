# Issue 24835: gfan-0.5 does not build with clang-6.0.0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-04-01 05:54:27

Log is attached. The gist:

```
clang++  -O2 -DGMPRATIONAL -Wuninitialized -g       -I/home/ralf/patchbot/sage/l
ocal/include -c printer.cpp
printer.cpp:442:11: error: no matching member function for call to 'real'

      imag(double __val) { __imag__ _M_value = __val; }
      ^
2 errors generated.
```

Again, it's picking up the wrong headers. Workaround is to use clang-5.0.1.
