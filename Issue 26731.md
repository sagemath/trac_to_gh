This cannot be reliably reproduced. Probably some parallelism issue (tests were run with 4 threads).

It would be nice to give every test process its own `DOT_SAGE` directory. Would that be possible? I tried doing that, but got confused as to how the doctest processes are actually started and how isolated they are from the "master" process. I tried setting `DOT_SAGE` in `env.py` based on `DOCTEST_MODE`, but that apparently always is `False`.

Yes, if there are any bugs resulting from user configuration those should be then reported by users and captured as a regression test: Tests should be isolated as possible and reproducible.

I think it would be quite practical; just nobody's been sufficiently motivated enough before now.

Repeating my comment I accidentally posted in #22652 here:

Replying to [comment:12 embray]:
> I still haven't looked at it that deeply but I suspect you're overthinking it.

`env.py` contains these lines:


```
_add_variable_or_fallback('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE',   opj('$DOT_SAGE', '.python-eggs'))
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_STARTUP_FILE',  opj('$DOT_SAGE', 'init.sage'))
```


Which is admittedly way less occurrences than I expected. Still, those would need to be re-evaluated or their usage changed.

> Though the concern about `MAXIMA_USERDIR` is definitely valid.  That's the kind of problem I wanted to address in #22652,

#22652 would be amazing. I don't see why it would necessary fix these issues though. Of course it would make sense to tackle both issues at the same time.

> but every time it's come up it's been easier to just implement a narrow fix rather than a general solution.

Speaking of narrow fixes, for this specific use-case, for this particular issue that should do it (how do I get that nice patch highlighting on trac?):
