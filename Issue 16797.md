CC:  vdelecroix

With this branch the users do not have access to the "designs.orthogonal_array" function which returns int/bool/OA(/string) values. It is deprecated, and replaced with "designs.orthogonal_arrays.*" function that do the same.

Instead of having 3 times the same functions for MOLS and TD, I chosed to remove the arguments in those other constructors, redirecting the users toward the OA functions. I believe that it is better in the long run, as copy/pasting everything really seems pointless.

Additionally, this branch adds a *NICE* feature:


```
sage: print designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,151)
From a projective plane of order 151
sage: print designs.orthogonal_arrays.explain_construction(10,935)
Brouwer's separable design construction with t=16,q=7,x=23 from:
    Andries E. Brouwer,
    A series of separable designs with application to pairwise orthogonal Latin squares
    Vol. 1, n. 1, pp. 39-41,
    European Journal of Combinatorics, 1980
```

Hello,

I like much better the interface now!

In `OA_build` the argument `resolvable` is not used (and not tested).

Why do you still allow `k=None` in the function `orthogonal_array`? It would be simpler/cleaner if it was only managed by `largest_available`. No?

Well, I have a lot of things to write when this will be reviewed. Like the functions to get all n such that there exists an `OA(k,n)`, and stuff for incomplete orthogonal arrays too that I need for yet other applications of the Brouwer van Rees construction.

All the stuff that I cannot write when everything is done through the same function.

Oh. Right. That's because I had created a "build_resolvable" function at some point in the interface, and did not add it in the end.

It depends on you. I hate the very principle of backward compatibility, but that's why it is there, because the guys who call `designs.orthogonal_array` and will persist in doing so for a year even if it displays a warning need to be able to call it anyway, or so I am told.

When this thing will not be deprecated anymore this will only be internal code and we will be allowed to remove whatever we want whenever we want.

I see. Following the deprecation rules, the code will not be deleted before sage 6.5. And at that time we might have forget about this! What do you think about an extra deprecation there?

Hi,

I pushed a commit at `u/vdelecroix/17034`. With your version we add a very ugly documentation for

```
sage: designs.orthogonal_arrays?
```

I moved the examples from the function `orthogonal_array` to the class used for the tab completion.

I also renamed `OATabThing` into `OAMainFunctions`... it is much more explicit.

Beyond my modifications:
- why do we have `designs.orthogonal_arrays.build` but `designs.orthogonal_arrays.exists`. It should be uniform for the presence/absence of `s`.
- having a class `OATabThing` to imitate a module is really ugly... wouldn't it be better to create a new file `orthogonal_arrays_catalog.py` which would gather the things.
- you wrote that you would like to remove the argument `existence` from the function `orthogonal_array`... but I really do not see how we can achieve that right now without duplication!

Thanks

I prefered mine. Those are not the 'main functions', they are the ones exposed to the user. The 'main function' is `orthogonal_array` that they don't see anymore.

> Beyond my modifications:
>  - why do we have `designs.orthogonal_arrays.build` but `designs.orthogonal_arrays.exists`. It should be uniform for the presence/absence of `s`.

As we are only talking of english here, I do not agree. "Build" is an order given to Sage. As in "Build me that orthogonal array". While for 'exists' comes from "An OA(k,n) exists". In particular, you can't order something to exist. But perhaps it already exists `:-P`

>  - having a class `OATabThing` to imitate a module is really ugly... wouldn't it be better to create a new file `orthogonal_arrays_catalog.py` which would gather the things.

Well, I did that to avoid creating a new file for absolutely nothing. Otherwise it means newfile+doc module+entry in the reference manual+import the functions+import the module.

Here we have a class defined with 10 lines, I found that better.

>  - you wrote that you would like to remove the argument `existence` from the function `orthogonal_array`... but I really do not see how we can achieve that right now without duplication!

Oh, sorry. I will fix that in my next commit. You have no idea how many 'drafts' of this patch I wrote before deciding that it was the right way.

Yo !

> Does the function `largest_available_k`, `explain_construction`, `OA_build`, `OA_exists` and `OA_is_available` are intended to be used by programmers? I guess that it is not. So Why not defining them directly as staticmethod in `OATabThing` (or `OAMainFunctions` that you dislike)... and about the name, why not `OAPublicFunctions`?

I really don't care about any of those points. Do it if you like, or let it stay like that.

This being said, I plan on adding new functions to "list all 'k' such that there exists an `OA(k,n)`", or similar functions for incomplete orthogonal arrays, and those functions may be used by both developpers and users.

Why is it a problem if they call each other ?

Function calls cost. I do not like using `OA_is_available` rather than `orthogonal_array` directly.

In #22796, I'm removing some deprecation introduced by this ticket.

This ticket added this comment:

```
# When this deprecated function is removed, remove the handling of k=None in the
# function orthogonal_arrays.orthogonal_array()
```


but the argument `k is None` for `orthogonal_array` is still used in some doctests in `src/sage/combinat/designs/orthogonal_arrays.py`. So I will **not** do what the comment asks me to do.

In any case, the handling of `k is None` should be deprecated first before it can be removed.
