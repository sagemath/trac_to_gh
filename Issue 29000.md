Failed example:
    oeis(L)                                       # optional -- internet
Expected:
    0: A000045: Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
    1: A212804: Expansion of (1-x)/(1-x-x^2).
    2: A132636: a(n) = Fibonacci(n) mod n^3.
Got:
    0: A000045: Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
    1: A212804: Expansion of (1-x)/(1-x-x^2).
    2: A324969: Number of unlabeled rooted identity trees with n vertices whose non-leaf terminal subtrees are all different.
