# Issue 14623: Unpickling of matroids sometimes fails

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14827

Original creator: Stefan

Original creation time: 2013-06-26 12:14:05

Assignee: sage-combinat

Trying to load a previously saved matroid fails when the lazy_import statements have not yet been resolved.

To reproduce:


```
sage: Q6 = matroids.named_matroids.Q6()
sage: Q6.save("Q6.sobj")
```


Exit Sage, restart, then

```
sage: Q6 = load("Q6.sobj")
```


The loading fails.
