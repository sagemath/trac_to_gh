# Issue 16391: Clarify how/where to install optional packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16628

Original creator: kcrisman

This is currently a ridiculous situation.  Some packages are only available in 'old-style', but 'new-style' ones aren't installable (as far as I can tell) with a single command `sage -do_this`.  The install guide still uses the `sage -i` syntax (which makes a lot of sense to me) and there is no place the new procedure is documented, not really even in the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#manual-package-build-and-installation), though people shouldn't have to look at that to (say) install the small groups package.  (And it wouldn't hurt to add some FAQ somewhere, or a nice test in a very visible place for groups, about that, as it keeps getting asked.)

I don't understand the problem here, can you please clarify? Both old and new packages can be installed using

```
./sage -i package_name
```

There is an issue with optional packages, namely that [http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/) only lists the old packages, but that doesn't seem to be what this ticket is about...

Well, at any rate I have personally had trouble installing new-style optional spkgs with `sage -i` when there is an older version still up on the old packages list.  I cannot now remember precisely which ones.  I've always ended up having to put stuff in `upstream/` first.

In general, `./sage -i package` should work both for old and new packages. It could of course be that there is a problem with _a specific package_ or that somewhere, there is bad documentation for _a specific package_. Therefore, this ticket should either be made more concrete or closed as "invalid".

I'm sorry I don't have more specific info today.  I hope I won't have to open another ticket like this, but I guess you can close it.
