# Issue 16391: Clarify how/where to install optional packages

I don't understand the problem here, can you please clarify? Both old and new packages can be installed using

```
./sage -i package_name
```

There is an issue with optional packages, namely that [http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/) only lists the old packages, but that doesn't seem to be what this ticket is about...

Well, at any rate I have personally had trouble installing new-style optional spkgs with `sage -i` when there is an older version still up on the old packages list.  I cannot now remember precisely which ones.  I've always ended up having to put stuff in `upstream/` first.

In general, `./sage -i package` should work both for old and new packages.

Therefore, this ticket should either be made more concrete or closed as "invalid".
