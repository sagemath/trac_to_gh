Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-02 17:05:37

For what it's worth, I was trying to build without setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all: I removed those lines from `src/bin/sage-env`.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-02 17:54:29

Note that these lines are only executed when using python3 installed from spkg, not system python


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-05 20:54:33

looks like this should wait till 9.3


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-05 20:55:49

Sure, Big Sur is still in beta.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 17:41:03

Xcode 12 has been released, and it causes breakage with Catalina, so perhaps this should be a blocker for 9.2. (For example I now cannot build Sage: I upgraded a laptop to a beta release of Big Sur, and on my main machine Xcode updated itself to version 12 overnight.)


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-17 19:06:33

I agree. It would be good to figure out if the upstream maintainers of these packages are already aware of these issues.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-17 19:06:33

Changing priority from critical to blocker.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-17 20:26:41

Can we score an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Transition_Kit_(2020) - and Apple ARM prototype for developers somehow?
It might be very useful for testing. Probably a Raspberry Pi with a 64-bit OS comes close, but not as much.

This is unrelated to this ticket.

I have opened #30592 (Meta-ticket: Port to Apple silicon) for that. Let's keep the present ticket focused please. No new hardware is required.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 20:35:15

It seems that when configuring `gf2x` and `ecl`, at least, something like `-Wall` is being used. I see this kind of thing in the `config.log` files for those:

```
conftest.c:4:3: error: implicitly declaring library function 'exit' with type 'void (int) __attribute__((noreturn))' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  exit(0);
  ^
conftest.c:4:3: note: include the header <stdlib.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'exit'
1 error generated.
```

Is there some setting in Xcode's command-line tools that has changed, causing these errors?

Similar with `ecm`:

```

Hi,

I just learned about this ticket. (me = upstream gf2x)

I don't have access to a box of this kind, so I can't test. (all I have is macOS 10.15.5 + XCode 11.6).

It looks like latest xcode doesn't like the tests that are generated by autotools, right ? If yes, does a autoreconf with fresh autotools fix the problem ?

E.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 20:49:05

The Sage build log for `symmetrica` contains:

```
hiccup.c:478:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'set_multiplier' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
                set_multiplier(S_MO_K(S_L_S(a)));

I'm seeing this on OS X 10.15.6 after an upgrade to Xcode 12. You could try upgrading to Xcode 12, if you're willing to take that risk.

I'm not an expert in this sort of thing, but I don't think this will work. `autoreconf` would help if Sage's top-level `configure` script were running into problems, but the problems are coming from Sage packages. Those are just tarballs, and running `autoreconf` once won't help with those. For what it's worth, I unpacked the `gf2x` tarball and ran `autoreconf` on it, but I got the same error.

(This is with `autoreconf` 2.69 installed via homebrew. I did `brew upgrade` first. I'm not sure how to get a "fresh autotools".)

Here is the `config.log` for `gf2x`, in case it helps.

I think errors like this are usually from code incorrectly assuming that some header pulls in some other header.  Adding the correct includes should fix this.

Not light-heartedly for sure. It's a mac mini that has been living in an office of (very) mac-averse researchers for years and years, crawling under the ram demands of the latest macOS (and actually last it can support).

I didn't make myself clear. Of course I mean autoreconf for gf2x.

ok.

> (This is with `autoreconf` 2.69 installed via homebrew. I did `brew upgrade` first. I'm not sure how to get a "fresh autotools".)

doesn't say much. 2.69 is the banner under which all autoconf version have been presenting themselves for 8 years. IDK about the others, but I suspect autoconf is at fault here anyway.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 21:32:02

The `gf2x` configure script says

```
cat >conftest.c <<EOF
int
main ()
{
  exit(0);
}
EOF
```

and it looks like this is the file causing the problems. How is this generated? `autotools`? Should `autotools` be adding some includes?

Edit: this is in `config/acinclude.m4`.


---

Attachment

grr. trac deleted my comment.
Try the patch above. This will fix both the autoconf input (just in case) and output (so that you don't have to rerun autoconf, a plain ./configure would do).
These bits of the config checks are created by m4 code that sits in gf2x, so it's really a gf2x bug.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 21:36:12

That looks good: `./configure; make; make check` now works. Thanks!

Replying to [comment:14 jhpalmieri]:

I think that -Wall is not the problem. We're witnessing a -Werror behaviour here. That is odd. -Werror in config checks is a bit extreme, and easily counter-productive. config checks that battle the -Werror reports might well defeat the grand portability goal of autoconf

The catch with my patch above is that because of this -Werror behaviour, I think that more failures are likely to show up down the line. (well, you seem to say that it works fine. good!)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 22:12:21

I can do the same kind of fix with `ecl`: add `#include <stdlib.h>` in the `configure` script. I'm not sure what to do with `ecm` or `symmetrica`. I haven't looked at `scipy` yet at all.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 23:06:29

I've put the `gf2x` fix on #30593.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-17 23:10:43

Change for `ecl` is at #30594. I don't know if it's the best approach, but it appears to work.

Found only one somewhat related discussion on the SciPy issue tracker

Might be worth opening a ticket there.

configuring it outside of Sage, and specifying which release you used?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-18 09:47:48

I cannot reproduce the breakade you are talking about. It all works for me with Xcode 12.0 on macOS 10.15.6. 
The latest Xcode 12 beta is in fact 12.2.beta. I'll check with it shortly.

Changing priority from blocker to critical.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-18 11:36:17

Downgraded to critical, as this is about a beta, which should not stop the release.

Volker, what is your take on this? This is all about betaOS/beta tools. Would be nice to have in 9.2 fixed, but not strictly necessary.

---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-18 12:47:45

sorry for noise - it turns out that to properly reinstall command line tools, one needs to `sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
Once I did the latter, and reinstalled, I got clang 12 there, too.

That is, XCode 12 (stable) also suffers from these ailments.

I can report directly on gmp-ecm bug tracker - but it's still on gforge. Are you planning to move to https://gitlab.inria.fr/ ?

the gmp-ecm issue is fixed upstream, and waiting for a new release, the patch at the link in comment [comment:38] can be used in Sage.

it is already in #30600 - with a configure patch too, naturally (as we don't require autotools).


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-18 17:03:22

as to symmetrica - I don't grok its code. It seems that `set_root_multiplier` is a no-op?


```
% cd upstream/symmetrica-2.0
% grep -R set_root_mu .
./hiccup.c:	set_root_multiplier (OP extra);
./hiccup.c:		set_root_multiplier(S_MO_K(S_L_S(a)));
./hiccup.c:set_root_multiplier (extra) OP extra;
./hiccup.c:		set_root_multiplier(S_MO_K(S_L_S(a)));
```

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-18 18:21:33

I don't really know what I'm doing, but I feel like I've made some progress with symmetrica with the attached patch and with this change to Sage:

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-install.in b/build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-install.in
index bc5d8e5f26..a071b6fece 100644

+++ b/build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-install.in
@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ cd src

 cp -f ../patches/makefile makefile || exit $?

+export CFLAGS="-O2 -g $CFLAGS -fPIC -DFAST -DALLTRUE -DUNDEF"

```

I don't know if this is a good approach, though.

Yes, that works fine for me. Same for readline, but both of those were reported as failures on sage-release.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-18 20:19:32

Perhaps the Xcode 12 tickets for packages for which we can use working homebrew packages should be considered "critical", not "blockers" - but they need to be fixed too.

Sure, sounds good.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-18 21:44:42

I think we're just down to symmetrica now, combined with a reasonable set of homebrew packages. I don't know enough (read: any) C to be able to do anything meaningful with symmetrica, though.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-19 02:51:41

`mpir` has a similar issue: its configure script fails because of the same sort of error. Again, the homebrew package works just fine.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-19 03:15:51

`python3` builds with Xcode 12 on OS X 10.15.6, which is nice. It failed the last time I tried it with OS X 11, but maybe that's just a `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` misconfiguration. It can be dealt with later, in any case.

`gsl` fails. Its `config.log` says

```

See `config.log' for more details
```

(This is the only `config.log` file around, so I'm not sure what it's talking about.) Maybe the homebrew installations of `openblas` and `gsl` are confusing it. To be honest, I'm not sure that Sage's `gsl` built with the homebrew `openblas` before.

There is a problem with another package, but I can't figure out which. If I run

```
$ ./configure --with-system-boost_cropped=no --with-system-curl=yes --with-system-freetype=no --with-system-glpk=no --with-system-gmp=no --with-system-libffi=no --with-system-libgd=no --with-system-libpng=no --with-system-mpc=no --with-system-mpfi=no --with-system-mpfr=no --with-system-ninja_build=no --with-system-ntl=no --with-system-pkgconf=no --with-system-ppl=no --with-system-python3=no --with-system-sqlite=no --with-system-suitesparse=no --with-system-yasm=no --with-system-zeromq=no --with-system-zlib
```

then Sage builds, but the docs fail with this:

I've tried configuring with a subset of those packages specified, but I haven't been able to narrow it down.

There's some ppl stuff in the backtrace, so that would be my first guess


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 04:26:39

I saw that, too. I thought I'd checked it, but I'll try again. (Taking a working build and then doing `./sage -f ppl` resulted in a successful build, but I'll try from scratch.)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 05:30:31

After running

```
./configure --with-system-glpk=no --with-system-gmp=no --with-system-ppl=no
```

`sagelib` fails to build, and there are lots of messages like this:

```
ld: illegal thread local variable reference to regular symbol __ZN3NTL20ZZXFac_InitNumPrimesE for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

```

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-20 05:39:19

This might be unrelated breakage coming from homebrew's ntl/flint packages - tracked at #29339/#27764


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-20 05:41:36

Best to remove these from the homebrew installation. In some situations these packages seem to leak into Sage even with `--with-system...=no`, as reported recently on sage-devel


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 23:01:44

Okay, after removing homebrew's `ntl`, I see the failure in comment:69 with `./configure --with-system-glpk=no --with-system-gmp=no --with-system-ppl=no`. For what it's worth, if I do `make distclean`, followed by the above configure command, followed by `export SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `make ppl`, then `ppl` passes its test suite.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-20 23:43:29

`glpk` pass its test suite, and `gmp` shows one failure:

```
../../test-driver: line 107: 32897 Abort trap: 6           "$@" > $log_file 2>&1
FAIL: t-sqrlo
```

Did you try with Sage's GMP 6.1.2?
It's old. I tried building and testing GMP 6.2.0, all its tests pass.
For the record, it's on `kabylake-apple-darwin19.6.0`, clang version 1200.0.32.4

This is the same GMP version as on Homebrew, so it should be OK to use the latter.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-21 13:13:22

I've opened #30625 to update GMP

Yes: using Sage's gmp, glpk, and ppl leads to failures when building the documentation (and also doctest failures along the same lines): see comment:69. I was trying to see if the packages passed their test suites after seeming to install correctly.

I also see an error in a scipy selftest, related to Cython.

gsl did build well with the patch for openblas from #30610

see #30631 for an R fix

`giac` builds, but hangs on startup. And some giac-related tests time out too.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-23 06:45:43

With beta13, #29061, #28623, #30486 (i.e. arb 2.18) and flint(2.6.1)+ntl+gmp+mpfr+mpc+mpfi+readline(and deps)+boost from Homebrew - but openblas, gsl, R built by Sage (with the updates),
all the long tests pass. So this seems to be sorted, more or less.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-23 20:26:24

I agree that the Xcode 12 issue is in good shape, but not OS X 11. I'm trying to build on a beta version of that and Python is failing to build. First, Sage insists on building Python because its check for sqlite3 fails:

```
configure:30755: ./conftest
Assertion failed: (strcmp(sqlite3_libversion(),SQLITE_VERSION)==0), function main, file conftest.cpp, line 73.
./configure: line 3360:  9722 Abort trap: 6           ./conftest$ac_exeext
configure:30755: $? = 134
configure: program exited with status 134
...
configure:30759: result: no
configure:30787: no suitable system package found for SPKG sqlite
```

This also triggers the Python build. That fails because: first it failed to build the `zlib` module. When I installed Sage's zlib, then it started complaining that it couldn't build the `readline` module. I'm still trying...


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-09-24 00:05:19

It would be worth checking whether using the homebrew package for sqlite is helpful


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-09-24 00:16:53

It's installed. 

By installing Sage's `sqlite` and `readline` (and by unsetting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` — don't know if this was necessary), I've gotten `python3` to build. Now `scipy` is causing problems, even with #30604:

Try with gfortran from the spkg. My guess is that the homebrew package for gfortran is not ready yet for macOS 11

let us split this ticket into two, one for XCode 12 on macOS 10, and the other for macOS 11.

now that the GMP-ECM related issue has been fixed, is there a way I can stop receiving updates from that ticket, which are quite frequent, and no really interesting for me?

Sorry, our Trac server does not offer that option.

That could be solved by updating Trac or adding
some Trac plugin or moving to a different issue
tracker, such as the GitLab one. None of these
seems likely to happen very soon.

So far all you can do is filter emails on your
side to send such updates to the trash.

Sorry about that.

while I am at it, I keep getting one doctest failure on Singular:

In `homebrew-macos-minimal-12` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1201629992), which builds python3 from SPKG, several doctests fail because of annoying messages 

```
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
```

I have opened #30711 for this


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-11-22 20:51:24

Can this be closed? I can build with Xcode 12, although it's with the support of various homebrew packages. Are minimal homebrew installations workable, or installations without homebrew at all?

(I may be able to test these, but maybe we already know the answers.)


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-11-22 20:53:58

It's certainly not a blocker any more, but perhaps useful to keep open to keep track of issues in optional/experimental packages


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-11-22 20:53:58

Changing priority from blocker to major.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-01-12 03:02:02

Can this be closed, or do we still want to keep it open for optional/experimental packages?

it remains #31314 ?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-06-07 00:50:36

That one is not really specific to Xcode 12, and we don't need a meta-ticket to keep track of a single open ticket


---

then why is it in the description of this ticket? One could remove it from the description?

Good point, I again forgot about these. And it turns out they are not being tested - I've opened #33755 for this

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-04-25 05:25:50

For what it's worth, I tried building `rubiks` and it seemed to hang. I'm trying again with a fresh Sage install, and also trying a few other packages at the same time.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-04-25 17:29:03

`deformation` succeeded for me, so I removed it from the ticket description. `polylib` fails on two different machines with the old familiar message `error: implicit declaration of function`. The `rubiks` build hangs on two different machines shortly after starting:

`boost` is no longer a package, and `fricas`, `e_antic`, and `csdp` all work for me.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-04-25 18:04:36

The experimental packages don't matter much (since they're experimental), but `lrslib` works for me. The others don't. `scipoptsuite` is broken because the tarball can't be found.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-04-25 18:48:04

I see the hanging build for `rubiks` now too. This must be a very recent regression. I built it quite recently (before upgrading to macOS Monterey)


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-04-25 20:05:06

Replying to [comment:123 jhpalmieri]:
> `scipoptsuite` is broken because the tarball can't be found.

Maybe this is intentional, given `SPKG.rst`: 

```
We do not have permission to redistribute SCIP or SoPlex. Hence, you
must download it yourself from http://scip.zib.de and put the tarball
``scipoptsuite-VERSION.tgz`` in ``$SAGE_ROOT/upstream``, renaming
it to ``scipoptsuite-VERSION-do-not-distribute.tgz``.
```

If anyone cares about this package, they should create a better error message: maybe create `spkg-preinst.in` that tests for the presence of the tarball in `upstream` and exit with an appropriate message if it's not there. I don't know if that would actually work, or if the tarball is attempted to be downloaded before anything else happens. Anyway, I don't care about this package, so I am not likely to work on it.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-04-25 20:06:24

Yes, it is intentional that there is no upstream_url and no tarball on our mirror.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-04-25 20:09:22

There appears to be an effort to provide a version of scipoptsuite under a free software license. I'll wait for that before putting more effort into packaging it

OK, I've removed them (and lrslib) from the ticket description
