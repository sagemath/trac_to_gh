CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

We change the mappings used in method `is_planar` from file `planarity.pyx` to avoid calls to `.vertices()`.

The changes done here were inducing a doctest error in method `genus` for

```
sage: cube.genus(circular=['01','10'], on_embedding=True)
```

As the documentation indicates that "If ``circular`` is defined, ``on_embedding`` is not a valid option", we now raise an error.
