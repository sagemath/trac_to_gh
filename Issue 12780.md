CC:  wdj kini

This patch adds 4 new graph constructors, that is DoubleStarSnar, FosterGraph, GrayGraph and HarriesGraph.

I am really having fun trying to build good drawings, but these graphs really get complicated sometimes !!! `:-)`

About the order, I didn't mean about your patch specifically (though your patch is also not following alphabetic order - D comes after C! :P ) - I mean the whole file.

I think it makes more sense to separate graphs generators into ones that define families of graphs and one that define single graphs. All four of the graphs in this patch would fall into the second category.

By the way, [PEP 8 recommends](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations) putting no spaces around "=" when defining default arguments in function definitions:


```python
def f(x, y, z=42):
```


not


```python
def f(x, y, z = 42):
```
