CC:  @wdjoyner @kini

This patch adds 4 new graph constructors, that is DoubleStarSnar, FosterGraph, GrayGraph and HarriesGraph.

I am really having fun trying to build good drawings, but these graphs really get complicated sometimes !!! `:-)`

Oh, the multiline list syntax? That is something I borrowed from Haskell style - IMO it is nice for a couple of reasons, 1) there is a visual line down the left side of the list which clearly shows where it begins and ends, and 2) adding a new element to the end of the list will only cause a diff of +1 line, not +2 lines / -1 lines like with the usual Python style.

About the order, I didn't mean about your patch specifically (though your patch is also not following alphabetic order - D comes after C! :P ) - I mean the whole file. I mean, why is `HarriesGraph` at the top of the file but `DoubleStarSnark` is under "Named Graphs"? It seems like the top of the file was originally for small graphs that are commonly used as components in other graphs, or something like that, but I guess `HarriesGraph` probably doesn't have that property, right? Etc. etc.

I think it makes more sense to separate graphs generators into ones that define families of graphs and one that define single graphs. All four of the graphs in this patch would fall into the second category.

By the way, [PEP 8 recommends](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations) putting no spaces around "=" when defining default arguments in function definitions:


```python
def f(x, y, z=42):
```


not


```python
def f(x, y, z = 42):
```
