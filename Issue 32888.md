Isn't this just because invoking `build/make/install` interrupts the `$MAKE` and `$MAKEFLAGS` magic that normally gets applied to sub-*make*s?

For example, this fixes `make -n sagelib` for me:


```patch

No, the problem is that we want to pass jobserver flags to something that is not `make` (and therefore does not handle `-n` etc.), namely the `spkg-install` script.

OK, you are right, there is broader breakage regarding `-n` etc. that has been around for a long time.

But there's a more specific problem (of blocker quality) caused by #32759. I've opened #33130 for it.

Let's address the broader problem in Sage 9.6.
