I think you need to justify why you want to do this.

```

If you do this, the code should satisfy the Sage standard of code. In particular, it should be fully doctested (which is far from the case for the current `ore_algebra` package).

Yes, indeed. The reason I would like to do this is because this code is useful, and including it will prevent us to break this by our numerous and rapid changes and deprecations.

For the documentation, of course, it will have to meet the requirements.

I made a branch, starting from the package version 0.2, but did not change the imports, so this is probably not working yet.

And this is seriously **lacking docs**.

Note that `ore_algebra` is still evolving, see new version at #22870. So if we want a merge to happen (do we?), i guess it should be made in collaboration with upstream developpers. Meanwhile, perhaps should the proposed modifications directly be contributed upstream.
