It should be easy to construct Laurent series from Laurent polynomials.  In univariate polynomials, we have the following:


```

    sage: Q.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: Q.completion(x)
    Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field

```


so similarly, we should have


```

    sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
    sage: R.completion(x)
    Laurent Series Ring in x over Rational Field

```
