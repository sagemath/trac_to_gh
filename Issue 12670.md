Reported by Laurent Decreusefond on sage-support:


```
sage: t = SR.symbol('t', domain='real')
sage: f = e^(-2*t)/sqrt(1-e^(-2*t))
sage: integrate(f,t,0,infinity)                        
-1
```


The sign is wrong, as the function is clearly positive. Just to check:


```
sage: numerical_integral(f, 0, infinity)
(0.99999999999919, 4.823208499260545e-09)
```


This is an upstream bug in Maxima:


```
Maxima 5.27.0 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp ECL 12.2.1
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) display2d: false;

(%o1) false
(%i2) f: 1/(%e^(2*t)*sqrt(1-1/%e^(2*t)));

(%o2) %e^-(2*t)/sqrt(1-%e^-(2*t))
(%i3) integrate(f, t, 0, inf);

(%o3) -1
```

Apparently fixed upstream.  So it would probably end up in Maxima 5.28, due early August, if I recall correctly.
