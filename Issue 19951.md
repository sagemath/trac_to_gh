I believe what you want is

```
.. automethod:: __init__
```

See the "private functions" subsection of http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings.

Personally I try to put such documentation at the class level.

Branch LGTM, so if you don't want to fiddle with the documentation, you can set this to a positive review (once you set the author name).
