I'll check that.

BTW : R-project released (of course !) 3.2.0 hours after I uploaded this patch ==> needs_work. I amend the ticket.

Actually can you check if you really need to rename upstream's tarball? We can deal with archive with a capital in their name (`Pillow` and `Sphinx` for example). You'll have to change `checksums.ini` to try that.

Upgrade to 3.2.0 done. Passes ptestlong ==> needs_review

R graphics : they work in the sage notebook, not on command line or ipython notebook (same as before...). This would deserve another ticket.

François : the build system may support names with a capital, but sage-fix-pkg-checksums do not. I won't fix that in this ticket. Should I (should you ?) open a new ticket ?

I am a bit surprised since we have other packages with capital in their names and they have to be checksumed too. In fact I just tried the script on Pillow and it worked (as in I removed checksum.ini for pillow and regenerated it). In fact I renamed the current R tarball from r-3.1.2.tar.gz to R-3.1.2.tar.gz and it worked too. Have you even tried it?

Important rectifications :

kcrisman : I was able to get R graphics in the ipython notebook ... but I had to %load_ext rmagic before, and work in a %%R cell. This is far from obvious after reading the docs. I understand that the ipython is work in progress, so this is not (yet) a big problem. But it should eventually be documented in a more obvious way. I am beginnig to think that some kind of guide to ipython notebook for (repentant ?) Sage notebook users would be useful. Maybe ditto for Cloud users (Sagemath cloud is really a different beast ...).

Note that you have to %load_ext rmagic, nor rpy2.ipython (error message : ImportError: No module named ipython"). Does this deserve a ticket ?

fbissey : I tried your way : I moved $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/r/checksums.ini out of the way, renamed $SAGE_ROOT/upstream/r-3.2.0.tar.gz to $SAGE_ROOT/upstream/R-3.2.0.tar.gz and ran sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums : *neither* r-3.2.0.tar.gz *nor* R-3.2.0.tar.gz appear in the list of recomputed checksums (nor does pillow or Pillow, by the way), and $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/r/checksums.ini is **NOT** recreated.

That was on 6.7beta1 + the present patch. Don't you have other patches ?

Status : still "needs_review", IMHO.

HTH,

I wouldn't be concerned about ipynb graphics since that is new (I mean, I'm not, others might be).  Has plotting from the command line ever worked without setting a graphics viewer (there is a name for this in R, I just forget it now).

I don't know anything about that, but rpy2 shouldn't be necessary for all this.

It's known as a "graphic device" in R docs.

To be clear,

```
r("plot(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))")
```

does nothing (on command line and in ipynb). Returns NULL

```
r("X11();plot(rnorm(1000),rnorm(1000))")
```

opens an X11 window (the R graphic device) and displays the cloud in this window (again on command line and in ipynb). Returns NULL, nothing displayed *in the notebook*.

Interestingly, neither `r.plot(r.rnorm(1000),r.rnorm(1000))` nor `r.X11();r.plot(r.rnorm(1000),r.rnorm(1000))` do anything on the command line (prints NULL, then the named vector (c("null device"=1). or in the notebook (ditto except that NULL is not printed).

I don't remember having ever used R from sage on the command line (my favorite interface was emacs  and ess, for obvious reasons, but The Sage notebook was sometimes handy, and ipynb appears more and more attractive, since %%R seems to work).

HTH,

Currently, it seems to be, at least in ipynb. In the Sage notebook, the only way I found  to get graphs reliably in the notebook itself was to open a device, plot on it (several graphs are possible) and close the device in the same %r cell. The same is possible in an rpy2 %%R cell vhithout to have to open/close the device.

That's very strange I was on 6.6 on a mac when I did that. Can you go in upstream and try `../sage -sh  sage-fix-pkg-checksums R-3.2.0.tar.gz` explicitly. It may be that it doesn't work with all shells.

I just did that *exactly*, with the same result : *nothing* is printed by the script, and the checksums.ini file is *not* recreated.

Yet another Appleism ? What shell do you use ?

It is bash 3.2 as far as I can tell. I am guessing you have 4.x.

Thinking more about it, I don't think it is strictly an appleism - not of the shell at any rate. I think the underlying file system may be case insensitive and just look case sensitive by hackery (not unlike FAT32 in some ways). In any case someone created checksums for `Pillow` and `Sphinx`...

François : If I follow you correctly, you conclude that Pillow, Sphinx and Mirage checksums can only be recreated on a Mac with a pseudo-case-sensitive filesystem ? If so I'd be tempted to call this a (serious) bug and file tickets against them.

OTOH, I wonder what has caused the "lower case only in source tarball names" rule to be added to the Sage byzantine build system. In other words, what would be broken if MixedCase nAmEs were allowed on tarball names ? In yet other words, should we hack up sage-fix-pkg-checksums  to allow it to work with mixed-case-named tarballs ?

HTH,

That's what it looks like yes.

The build system obviously works fine, otherwise we would have tons of reports about Sphinx and Pillow by now. But `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` should be dealt with it is the most obvious piece that cannot cope with mixed/uppercase characters as far as we can see here.

Obviously, `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` can deal with mixed case characters. It's just that the name in `build/pkgs` should match the tarball name. The tarball for `build/pkgs/r` must be named `r-something`, not `R-something`. It seems to be an unwritten(?) Sage convention that `build/pkgs` always uses a lower case name, so I recommend to use lower case also for the tarball name.

Comment by charpent created at 2015-04-21 10:42:03

OK. It seems now that, whereas at least two Sage developers are eager to qibble over the case of tarballs' names, no one has (yet) opened a ticket for this issue, which is *different* from the issue at hand, which is R-3.2.0.

Since it is a different issue, I do not think it is wise to try to fix it incidently. I will *not* touch it in this ticket.

1) Should I open a ticket over the tarball case question ?

2) Could some kind soul review my proposed fix ?

3) Should I open a ticket over the issue of sex of angels in Sage ?

For what it's worth, this fails on OS X 10.10.3. (So does the old version of R, but this one fails in a different way.) See [#18254](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18254#comment:53).

Hum, it looks like libR.so has been underlinked

which would go unnoticed if R.bin was compiled with `-lbzlib`. It looks like bzip2 was properly detected at configuration so we should be using the one shipped with sage. I'd ask for the `config.log` but I am fairly certain I won't see anything abnormal there. Still there could be something in there that wasn't printed.

So this means for MacOS X / Xcode (and only that?) we _currently_ (a moving target anyway) would have to configure with `--without-system-bzlib`, or fix the linking issue in another way, on this ticket here, right?

Not using Sage's bzlib would be a temporary solution anyway:

  _"Building R using the included versions of zlib, bzip2, xz and PCRE is deprecated: these are frozen (bar essential bug-fixes) and will be removed for R 3.3.0."_

(So Sage will finally include `xz` as well, such that we can use better compression for the upstream tarballs... :P )

Speaking of detection of `bzlib` in `R`, I have another annoyance to signal. The test to check the version of `bzlib` in `R`'s configure script is broken with gcc 5.1 - I noticed it in `R-3.2.0` so this is current. A header is missing in the test program they compile. If upstream is serious about the removal, they will notice quickly.

I am surprised on my power7 machine I get

```
checking zlib.h usability... yes
checking zlib.h presence... yes
checking for zlib.h... yes
checking if zlib version >= 1.2.5... yes
checking whether zlib support needs to be compiled... no

checking bzlib.h usability... yes
checking bzlib.h presence... yes
checking for bzlib.h... yes
checking if bzip2 version >= 1.0.6... no
checking whether bzip2 support needs to be compiled... yes
```

But looking closer I may have misdiagnosed it. I think on that system the wrong library may have been used in the test. That's a problem that has plagued the install of gcc 5.1 itself on that system. It doesn't happen with other version of gcc.

(So there, just `-lz` was missing.)

Configuring with `--without-system-bzlib --without-system-zlib`, the build succeeds (still with GCC 5.1.0).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-04 10:03:46

Yes, wrong library and I now understand the root cause of some of my problems on that system courtesy of IBM and nothing to do with `R` upstream. Anyway there is something strange going on with bzlib but I have no problem using the internal copy here. That being said I may uncover another surprise from the same source, it would take me a bit of time to disentangle the bits that causes gcc to prefer static libraries on my system and rebuild it. 

Very strange both zlib and bzlib, does bzlib depend on zlib somehow?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-04 10:26:23

Now that I have removed the interfering library from the system I can compile `R` with an external bzlib library and gcc 5.1.0 and I don't experience any of these troubles. 

Still there are problems linking an external bzlib on OS X and gcc 5.1.0 - on some systems. This is very strange. Does the failed libR.so have an entry for libbz2 at all?

No.

I've so far not found anything suspicious in `configure`; the libs get added to `LIBS` if the "system" versions are used, so the failing magic must be somewhere in the Makefiles (or some R config thingy these use).

No, but for libz when I configure without anything special (using system libraries for both libz and libbz2):

(And they're missing in the command building libR.so, cf. the very long lines some posts above.)

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 11:06:57

In the Makefile (in `src/src/main`) of the last attempt, we have:

```
## use an explicit library: there might be an unsatisfactory -lz around
R_ZLIBS = # ../extra/zlib/libz.a
R_BZLIBS =  ../extra/bzip2/libbz2.a
R_PCRE =  ../extra/pcre/libpcre.a
R_TRE =  ../extra/tre/libtre.a
R_XDR = # ../extra/xdr/libxdr.a
R_XZ =   ../extra/xz/liblzma.a
R_LIBINTL = # ../extra/intl/libintl.a
R_TZONE = # ../extra/tzone/libtz.a

MAIN_LIBS = ../unix/libunix.a ../appl/libappl.a ../nmath/libnmath.a
MAIN_OBJS = `ls ../unix/*.o ../appl/*.o ../nmath/*.o`
EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS = \
  $(R_ZLIBS) $(R_BZLIBS) $(R_PCRE) $(R_TRE) $(R_XDR) $(R_XZ) $(R_LIBINTL) $(R_TZONE)
STATIC_LIBS = $(MAIN_LIBS) $(EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS)

EXTRA_LIBS = $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) $(R_XTRA_LIBS)  $(READLINE_LIBS) $(LIBS)

R_binary = R.bin
R_bin_OBJECTS = Rmain.o #$(OBJECTS)
#R_bin_LDADD = $(MAIN_OBJS) $(EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS) $(EXTRA_LIBS)
## Linked against -lRblas becasue -lR is and otherwise ld complains.
R_bin_LDADD = -lR #-lRblas
R_bin_DEPENDENCIES =# libR.a # $(top_builddir)/etc/R.exp

libR_la = libR$(DYLIB_EXT)
libR_la_OBJECTS = $(OBJECTS)
libR_la_LIBADD =  $(MAIN_OBJS) $(EXTRA_STATIC_LIBS) $(EXTRA_LIBS)  # -Wl,-bE:$(top_builddir)/etc/R.exp
libR_la_DEPENDENCIES = $(STATIC_LIBS) $(R_TZONE)  # $(top_builddir)/etc/R.exp
```

so somehow `LIBS` got messed up (libz dropped) somewhere on the way.

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 11:14:08

In `src/Makeconf`, we already have just

```
## These are the libs which the final R.bin/libR is linked against.
## Many of these used to be optional: ICU libs still are.
## There may be platform-specific ones, e.g.
## -lrt -ldl on Linux, -lnsl -lsocket -lrt -lsunmath -ldl -liconv on Solaris.
LIBS =  -lrt -ldl -lm
```

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-04 11:30:36

You could check what you get for `LIBS` in `config.log` and `config.status`, I'll look at what is going on on OS X.


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 11:34:06

Yep, just found the "truncated" one in `config.status`, so it's apparentĺy a `configure` problem:

```
S["LIBS"]=" -lrt -ldl -lm"
```

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-04 11:40:26

Final results goes in the top `Makefile`. Why does `configure` behaves that way on some system and not some other. Dissecting on OS X.

Replying to [comment:63 fbissey]:

Well, the behaviour presumably depends on the outcome of some other tests in `configure`, such that sometimes the accumulated `LIBS` get clobbered.

Btw., it's not GCC 5.1; same with GCC 4.9 here.

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 15:45:50

Getting closer...

In the PCRE checks, `LIBS` gets restored from `r_save_LIBS`, but that's (in my case) an obsolete value, because `r_save_LIBS` didn't get set in _that_ check (i.e., the conditions for saving and restoring aren't the same).

Works for me (so far outside of Sage).  May work on MacOS X as well (omitting `--without-system-*`), but probably there'll be further problems when Sage's libs are used.

Go ahead if you care. I'll review it.

But I'm a little frightened : this is the *third* time that the port of a new version of R, which is a mindless affair, is hijacked for an unrelated bug (which, by the way, never gets repertoried under a proper heading !). Is filing a *different* bug that hard ?

[ Bandwidth savings ... ]

No it is not hard. I am guessing some people find it terribly inconvenient. I am guilty in indulging leif in continuing on this ticket.


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 21:26:22

? Fixing the bug in `R_PCRE` certainly belongs to upgrading R to 3.2.0, since the new version introduced the bug, and as you have seen, it hits at least some of us (depending on the system configuration).

1. This version introduced the bug : you're right, as far as I can tell. Your case seems to be a corner case.
2. It's the same problem : no. This is, as far as I understand, a problem with the build infrastructure of Sage. The new R version just revealed a latent bug in a very loosely related part of this infrastructure.

If I'd found this bug, I'd have opened a distinct ticket (T2) and made the present ticket (T1) depend on the new ticket (T2). That way, each different problem would have been identified in the tickets database. As should have been done when a previous version of R opened a Cygwin-related saga...

Am I clearer ?

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-04 21:48:54

Before I fix the "typo", could someone translate (i.e., rephrase) the following such that it makes sense?

```
    # Indeed Sage modifies DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH whereas R build process
    # modifies DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that it is Sage's R and not the freshly
    # built one which will get loaded during the build process and if they are
    # different versions then the build process might fail.
```


Maybe I'm blind or just dumb, but I twice read `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` -- the second occurrence should probably read `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, otherwise _"whereas"_ doesn't make sense to me.

It should be prudent to check the (forthcoming) patch by jhpalmieri on a 32-bit (virtual) machine (which I don't have) before accepting it.

Doesn't that means that R and Sage do *different*, possibly incompatible, changes to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ?

Possibly `{DY}LD_LIBRARY_PATH` plain `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is linux but `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is OS X's version.

sage does load the appropriate one so its libraries are found first but of course during the building process `R` does its own overloading to find the stuff from the just built `R` when building the standard `R` packages. In principle this should be done by augmentation but I have seen libtool doing broken things before (in octave it inserts `/usr/lib64` which completely defeat the purpose of the variable).

I'm guessing that this comes from http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14706#comment:101, in which case, the second version should say `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`.

My suggestion should only have an effect on OS X: it's in a block starting

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
```

And it is just a mistake in the shell script, yielding a (non-fatal) error

```
./spkg-install: line 164: RINSTALL_MOVED: command not found
```

every time you try to install R on an OS X machine.

Did you read the upstream report?

Same as what?

Nope.  The same happens outside of Sage.

Bug in Sage's infrastructure?  I don't get the point.

Well, technically that doesn't really make sense, since I cannot fix something that hasn't yet been included.  (#18254 is _slightly_ different as it modifies an existing file, namely `spkg-install`.)  My changes are based on your branch.

I would agree if we could make this ticket depend on upstream, but then it wouldn't be possible to (positively) review it before upstream decided on a solution.




> That way, each different problem would have been identified in the tickets database. As should have been done when a previous version of R opened a Cygwin-related saga...

We at least have different commits with IMHO meaningful commit messages... (which unfortunately often isn't the case).

You probably know my opinion on (not) bumping patch levels and discarding the package changelog we used to have for years.

Sometimes it is better to also fix "unrelated" minor issues (such as the typo) on a ticket dealing with a package (nowadays probably less than it was with "legacy" spkgs), since otherwise they'll simply never get fixed, either because nobody opens individual tickets for them, or  the tickets just rotten.

The prerequisite for inclusion of a new (or upgraded) package is that it builds/works on all supported platforms, so fixing build issues (and probably fixing doctests, cf. the PARI upgrade at #18340, which was motivated by an initially seemingly unrelated problem with GNU make) belongs to the ticket that introduces (or upgrades) a package.

There are other issues where it perfectly makes sense to open (a metaticket and) separate (sub-)tickets, e.g. to let Sage build with GCC 5.x (four tickets for four different packages which need fixing), or to let Sage build with `clang` (dozens of tickets).

It's a _potential_ syntax error, depending on how `R_INSTALL_MOVED` is defined ... ;-)


```sh
$ R_INSTALL_MOVED(){ expr $`@`; } 
$ R_INSTALL_MOVED = yes
expr: syntax error

I am looking at it right now from scratch with 6.7.beta4. Silly stuff, because this doesn't depend on #18156 switching to this branch removes the fix to gcc from 6.7.beta4. So I lost a couple of hours of building while I was doing the week end shopping.
