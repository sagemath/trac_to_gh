Patchbot finds a failed test (due to previous convention on weighted sum)



```
sage -t --long src/sage/plot/plot3d/index_face_set.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/plot/plot3d/index_face_set.pyx", line 225, in sage.plot.plot3d.index_face_set.midpoint
The Patchbot find a failed doc-test (due to previous convention for weighted sum of points):

Failed example:
    midpoint((1,2,3),(4,4,4),0.8)
Expected:
    (3.40000000000000, 3.60000000000000, 3.80000000000000)
Got:
    (1.60000000000000, 2.40000000000000, 3.20000000000000)
**********************************************************************
