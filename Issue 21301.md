`./configure` should accept an argument `--with-packages=...` so that a user can request a list of packages to be installed.

One could consider to have `sage -i` edit `config.status` (`ac_cs_config`) whenever a package is installed.

Also there should be an argument `--ignored-installed-packages` so that the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` is ignored. This is may be useful to ensure predictable builds.

Why not an argument `--enable-foo` (and/or perhaps `--with-foo=/path/where/installed`, depending on the answer to #21566#comment:3) for each package `foo`?

Yes, this syntax could also work and is probably a better idea. 

I like `--with-foo=/path/where/installed` too, but as I said on #21566, it won't happen on this ticket.

#27567 offers a slightly different approach, but I think effectively serves the same purpose as this proposal.

One thing it doesn't do yet is provide a way to enable specific optional/experimental packages at configure time.  One might also consider that useful, but I'm treating it as a separate issue for now.
