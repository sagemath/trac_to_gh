I noticed this in comment:18:ticket:14239.


```
sage: poly = QQ[x](x^7 - x - 1)
sage: root = sorted(poly.roots(QQbar, False), key=imag)[0]
sage: root
-0.3636235193291805? - 0.9525611952610331?*I
sage: nf = NumberField(poly, "y", embedding=CC(root))
sage: z = SR(nf.gen()); z
-3775/3963*I - 2573/7076
sage: poly(QQbar(z)).is_zero()
False
```


The problem here for me as a user is the fact that when I see rational numbers in some expression, I expect them to be accurate. But the conversion to SR here uses `solve(to_poly_solve=True)`, which according to its documentation may yield approximate solutions. I'm still surprised that these approximate solutions may take the form of elements from ℚ[I]. I guess some code further down the line might get confused as well, since these conversions look as if they were exact.

I guess it might be next week before I find the time to have a closer look at this. And I don't know the code in this area, and have little experience with Maxima itself either. In any case, would I be correct to assume that `options='algexact:true'` is the critical point here?

Notes to self or any other reviewer:
* Omitting `multiplicities` in the condition makes sense, since `to_poly_solve=True, multiplicities=True` would already raise a `NotImplementedException` earlier on.
* Not messing around with `repr(x) in …` is certainly a good thing.
* The move from `Y = ….sage()` to `T = string_to_list_of_solutions(repr(s))` I don't understand yet. Need a closer look.
* The rationale behind `ignore_exceptions` I don't understand either yet.

A lot of this appears to be drive-by-fixes which make sense but are not immediately related to this bug here. Is that correct? Can you come up with doctests for the things these fix, if it's more than code simplification? For example I suppose that having one variable name as a substring of another might confuse this `repr(x)` hackery.

I would prefer changing the `while todo: ex = todo.pop()` back to `for eq in todo:`. As it stands now, the idiom suggests that you might be adding stuff to the list within the loop. This even had me concerned about infinite loops for a moment. But you don't do that, you simply iterate over the list.

Thanks, I switched to the while because the original code did add/remove stuff. But that was all wrong, and I forgot to switch it back. 

The main bug of the entire logic was that `X` was being iterated over and modified at the same time, so some solutions were skipped while other solutions were ran twice through Maxima. The first call to Maxima yielded a floating-point answer, and in the subsequent call Maxima converted the floating-point number to a rational.

There was a similar bug when solve originally found no solution, causing maxima `to_poly_solve` to be called twice. I fixed that, too.

The main doctest is the one you gave where some numerical solutions were incorrectly returned as rational.

Absolutely not.  `to_poly_solve` was added to get lots more exact solution.  As a byproduct of that, occasionally inexact solutions are returned.  See the documentation for `solve?` or `x.solve?` for lots of examples.

Hmm, that is most likely true, since the point is to solve things that are not polynomials (you convert them to polys), though I'm not 100% sure - I would want to confirm that with Barton.
