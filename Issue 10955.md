The attached patch solves an issue with jmol finding the right .jmol.zip file in the new flask notebook.  This patch should only be applied *after* the notebook is moved to a flask notebook.

The patch should replace the following line in `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`

```
f.write('set defaultdirectory "%s"\n' % archive_name)
```

with

```
import sagenb
f.write('set defaultdirectory "cells/%s/%s"\n' % (sagenb.notebook.interact.SAGE_CELL_ID, archive_name))
```

This week, I compiled sage-4.7.1.rc0 and installed the new flask Sage notebook following instructions from : http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/. I also followed the section `Adding stock Jmol` plus the patch `trac_11078.patch`. This made Jmol to work from the notebook : Great!

But, from the command line, with the patch `trac_11078.patch` a command like `sphere()` opens Jmol but Jmol stays all black. I had to mimic the modifications done in #11503 on the same file `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx` to make Jmol works properly from the command line.

I updated the patch with the changes from #11503.  With the flask notebook, sphere() works both from the command line and from the notebook.

I'm setting as needs review to have one other person double-check this patch works as intended, though I guess I might qualify as the only needed reviewer.  Basically, what I did here was just rebase the patch at #11503.
