CC:  vdelecroix jipilab cremona tscrim mmezzarobba jdemeyer

Number fields with coercion embeddings, in particular with real embeddings, behave quite differently from those without - but there's no indication of embeddings in the print representation:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
sage: a.parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
sage: K.<sqrt2> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, embedding=1.4)
sage: sqrt2.parent()
Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
```


I propose to change the print representation when there is an embedding, for example like this:

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, embedding=1.4)
sage: sqrt2.parent()
Real Number Field in sqrt2 as the root of the defining polynomial x^2 - 2 near 1.41421356237309?
```

Shorter sentence would be better.

```
Real Number Field in sqrt2 as the root of x^2 - 2 in [1.41, 1.42]
```

Ideally (as above), the `X` in `near X` should have the form of an interval `[1.41,1.42]` that specifies uniquely the root.

Which is not that bad except the `a in 1.618033988749895?`. Would make more sense with `a in [1.61, 1.62]` or `a = 1.618033988749895?`.

In this patch I am using a format with `with a = ...` now (as suggested by nbruin), which works well also for the complex case:

```
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^13 - 2/3*x + 3 with a = -1.106745229567614?
```

and for more complicated situations such as this one:

```
            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - 3); K
            Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - 3
            sage: H.<b>, from_H = K.subfield(a^2)
            sage: H
            Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 3 with b = a^2
```


The output for the following looks a bit strange because printing goes through `sage.rings.real_lazy.LazyBinop`:

```
sage: QuadraticField(-1, 'a')
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with a = 1*I
```

Should we special case this?
