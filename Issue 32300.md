Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in sage.combinat, sage.graphs).

Here we avoid the use of `Integer(round(p.solve(...)))` whenever possible.

```
+            p.solve(objective_only=value_only, log=verbose)
+            b = p.get_values(b, convert=bool, tolerance=integrality_tolerance)
```

Shouldn't the first line use `objective_only=False` if the next line uses `get_values`?

The default value of `objective_only` is `False`,so I removed it from the call.
Actually, I think that this parameter is (currently) not used at all by our solvers.
