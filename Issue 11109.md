.. math:: environments seem to be ignored in the live documentation. See e.g. http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.html (with the notebook running on your machine).

Hmm.  This works for me (both 4.6 and 4.7.rc1, OS X 10.6.7 Intel, both Safari and Firefox).  Can you give more information about your set-up?  Has it worked for you with any version of Sage?  Are you sure it wasn't still "Processing Math"?

Oups, I was not specific about where in the file the issue wasx. I just added info to the description.

Sage 4.6.2 vanilla, Firefox 3.6.16, Ubuntu and OpenSuse. 

> Has it worked for you with any version of Sage?

Sorry, I don't know.

> Are you sure it wasn't still "Processing Math"?

Nope.

Cheers,

Just to clarify, both of the ".. math" environments in this file (in random_element and theta_series) work for me.

I have changed this to "reported upstream, developers acknowledge bug" (see #8482 for rationale).

I cannot reproduce this either, see comment:3, on Safari or FF.  Mathjax seems to be fine.   I've closed the upstream ticket, please open a different upstream ticket if you still find this a problem.  (There are a number of changes that might have made this happen, including upgrading sagenb.org.)

Seems indeed to work fine on my machine. Kuddos to whoever fixed this :-)
