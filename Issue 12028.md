Mestre's algorithm for constructing hyperelliptic curves has been implemented see ticket [#6341](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6341) but it does not work over finite field of characteristic 2


```
    .. TODO::
    
        Mestre's algorithm also only works over finite field of charateristic different from two, another algorithm will be needed for field of characteristic two.
        sage: HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants([GF(2)(1),GF(2)(1),GF(2)(0),GF(2)(1)]) # todo: not implemented

This can be done by porting the g2twists magma package

Changing keywords from "Hyperelliptic curve sd35" to "mestre algorithm genus 2 hyperelliptic curves sd51".
