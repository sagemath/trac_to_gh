# Issue 16123: Conversion of function field elements to pari

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16360

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2014-05-16 12:39:35

CC:  mmarco

Keywords: pari, resultant, function field

The resultant does not work for function fields if the variable names are not chosen wisely:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: y.resultant(y+x)
PariError: variable must have higher priority in gtopoly
```


The resultant is wrong over extensions of function fields: 

```
sage: K.<a> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<b> = K[]
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(b^2-a)
sage: R.<x> = L[]
sage: f=x^2-a
sage: g=x-b
sage: f.resultant(g)
-b + a^2 # should be 0 since f and g have the common root b
```

Changing keywords from "pari, resultant, function field" to "pari, resultant, function field, sd59".

CCed mmarco since it seems he worked on that before (and is at sd59).
