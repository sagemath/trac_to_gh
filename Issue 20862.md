You claim in the doc

```
+        INPUT:
+
+            - ``R`` - a ring (optional).
```

but there is no argument to your function...

The function accepts non-morphisms and should probably not.


```
set_verbose(None)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2,x*y])
f.critical_subscheme()
```

Fixes from last review added.  
critical_subscheme now checks that the object is a morphism
example added to document this
