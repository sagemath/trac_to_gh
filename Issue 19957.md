# Issue 19957: expression conversion bug with Sympy functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20194

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-03-11 08:56:38

With the Sympy-1.0 upgrade (#20185)

```
sage: import sympy
sage: u = sympy.Function('u'); n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(3*u(n), evaluate=False)
NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'u' doesn't exist
```

which disappears when `3*u(n)` is changed to `u(n)*3` or `u(n)`
