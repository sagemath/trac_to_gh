# Issue 21699: Implementing is_nonnegative()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2016-11-22 20:22:10

Keywords: sage79

Is it not easy to simply write:

```python
def is_nonnegative(self):
    return self.is_positive() or self.is_zero()
```


And similarly:

```python
def is_nonpositive(self):
    return self.is_negative() or self.is_zero()
```

Changing keywords from "sage79" to "days79".

Hi Peleg,

Where would this be included?

Probably just after `def is_positive()` in `cdef class Expression` in `symbolic/expression.pyx`.

Please add for which object (Expression) the method is intended to the title and description of the ticket to make it more precise.

Note that there is only experimental support for these flags in Sage (see #19162). They are read from the internal Pynac implementation where the return value is computed.

If this is the case, we may wish to add a warning in the relevant docstrings.
We may still, however, add `is_nonnegative`, etc.  Shouldn't we?
