# Issue 31653: simplif_hypergeometric is unstable

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31890

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2021-06-01 08:14:43

The following doctest in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` is unstable and can cause sage to crash:


```
sage: (nest(lambda y: hypergeometric([y], [1], x), 3, 1)
....:  .simplify_hypergeometric()) 
```

See attached crash report.

The `sage` algorithm also fails: See attached crash report.

Crash report with algorithm='sage'

Less harmful is the following error:

```


Those errors appear with both algorithms as well.
