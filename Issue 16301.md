In an offline proccess, I reviewed several iterations of this rather large patch and contributed a few commits with small improvements. I believe that the patch does what it is supposed to do; doctests pass; documentation builds.

The documentation, in particular those of the high level methods `.process`, `.__call__`, `.iter_process`, `.epsilon_successors` and perhaps also of `FSMProcessIterator`, `FSMProcessIterator.__next__` and `FSMProcessIterator.results` should be reviewed independently.
