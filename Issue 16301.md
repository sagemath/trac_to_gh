# Issue 16301: FiniteStateMachine.process: follow all paths if machine is non-deterministic

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16538

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-06-25 15:17:27

CC:  dkrenn skropf

Keywords: finite_state_machine

Currently, a (more or less) random path was chosen in case of ambiguity
in `FiniteStateMachine.process`. In the case of non-deterministic machines,
all possible paths should be considered.

In an offline proccess, I reviewed several iterations of this rather large patch and contributed a few commits with small improvements. I believe that the patch does what it is supposed to do; doctests pass; documentation builds.

The documentation, in particular those of the high level methods `.process`, `.__call__`, `.iter_process`, `.epsilon_successors` and perhaps also of `FSMProcessIterator`, `FSMProcessIterator.__next__` and `FSMProcessIterator.results` should be reviewed independently.

Clear "commit" field so that Daniel's new branch is actually used.

I improved parts of the documentation. Especially, those of the high level functions.

Replying to [comment:10 skropf]:

I reviewed your changes and pushed a few minor changes. 

Following the discussion on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/K2VW0BwGEr0/cFtGA2Isxp0J), the docstring of `__call__` is now included into the reference manual.

Some more small improvements. For me, this is a positive_review.

ok, reviewed all those changes. Merges cleanly with 6.3.rc0 (despite trac's automerge failure), doctests pass, documentation fine.
