Jerry James reported to me that printing is broken in libGap 4.7.5

```
sage: libgap.PrintTo('/tmp/out', 'test' * 10000)
sage: os.stat('/tmp/out').st_size
0
```

I accidentally lost the fix from the previous commit for printing in libgap when preparing libgap 4.7.5. Now with added doctest so it won't happen again.
