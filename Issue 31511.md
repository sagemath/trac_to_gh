Ready for review.

I don't have much experience with abstract complexes. I'd like to know if this is going in the right direction with Sage homology.

I'm also wondering what other methods of `PolyhedralComplex` could be interesting. Maybe interactions between `PolyhedralComplex` and `SimplicialComplex` such as `PolyhedralComplex.subdivide()` and `SimplicialComplex.geometric_realization()`? And interactions between `PolyhedralComplex` and rational polyhedral fan?

Note that the methods `wedge`, `chain_complex` and `alexander_whitney` are currently missing, as I don't know how to implement them.

Any advice or comment is greatly appreciated! Thanks.

It looks good to me so far, thank you for all of the work you've done.

I don't know anything about polyhedral complexes. The wedge is the one-point union, and to construct this, you're going to have to translate the two complexes so that they share a point. Is that acceptable? I could imagine taking a complex which has a point (x_1, x_2) and another complex which has a point (y_1, y_2), and forming the join by embedding both in a larger ambient space so that (x_1, x_2) -> (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) <- (y_1, y_2) — the first complex lies in the first coordinates, the second in the last coordinates. I don't know if that's a sensible construction from the point of view of people who actually work with these objects.

`chain_complex` — is there a standard way to produce a chain complex from a polyhedral complex? I would hope so, and I would hope that it's written down somewhere. We shouldn't invent something from scratch. Can we have a method that triangulates the complex and produces a simplicial complex? How hard would that be? I found this: https://sites.millersville.edu/rumble/slides/Seville-Feb-2018.pdf. Is it helpful?

`alexander_whitney` — I don't know how to handle this (although maybe the Umble slides describe it), and in any case, it's tied to a map of chain complexes, so there is no need to worry about it until the chain complex situation is resolved.

Do you mean the method `PolyhedralComplex.subdivide(make_simplicial=True)`? It produces a **geometric** simplicial complex. 
Then, #31842 - `CombinatorialPolyhedralComplex` will take care of making it abstract.

I agree that we can merge this without implementing the homology stuff. I have a few comments that should be addressed first:

- It feels like there is a lot of overlap with the `SimplicialComplex` code. Do we want to refactor things to common base classes and/or use inheritance?

I once heard that `self.is_xxx(other)` means that "`self` is xxx of `other`". Therefore, in this case, I would think that `cell.is_maximal_cell(polyhedralcomplex)` and `polyhedralcomplex.has_maximal_cell(cell)`. If this is not the convention in `sage/homology`, I'm happy to change the name to `is_maximal_cell`.
