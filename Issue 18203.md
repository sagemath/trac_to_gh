CC:  @nathanncohen

The incidence matrix of a graph is according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix):
- a matrix with 0, 1 and 2 if the graph is not oriented
- a matrix with 0, 1 and -1 if the graph is oriented
And in the oriented case there must be no loop.

Changing that is backward incompatible and breaks some example of the graph constructor.

This ticket comes from a question from David Joyner [on this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/pCgasKfrFyY).

> Hellooooooo ! I do not understand the purpose of your 'oriented' argument.

It seems that people are mostly interested in the oriented version, which needs an oriented graph. The reason is that

```
m * m.transpose() == m.kirckhhoff_matrix()
```

and this is true for oriented graph (even multiedges with loops with my branch ;-).

> You are right that the current function is wrong in what it does, i.e. orient arbitrarily the edges of an undirected graph in order to have a `-1,0,+1` matrix: why would you want to "keep this feature"?

I do not want to. It seems to be what people expect. I am 100% in favor of making the default unoriented for graphs but then we should find a simple solution to obtain the oriented version. Do you think that the following is simple enough

```
sage: G.to_directed().incidence_matrix()
```


> To me it does not make much sense. We could just define this parameter from the value of `self.is_directed`. Also, but that's only a typo, the documentation of 'oriented' says that it can make the  matrix 'oriented' or ... 'oriented'. Could you say somewhere that '2' only happens in the presence of loops?

Ha true true.

> Real graphs don't have loops `:-P`

Ha right. I always forgot that I am not doing graph theory with my graph with one vertex and three edges ;-)

"What's wrong with these people?"

> I do not want to. It seems to be what people expect. I am 100% in favor of making the default unoriented for graphs but then we should find a simple solution to obtain the oriented version. 

So why don't we do that? Guys who want to force an oriented version will only have to change the flag, won't they?

> Do you think that the following is simple enough
> {{{

This doubles the number of edges. It is not an arbitrary orientation, it replaces every undirected edge with a 2-cycle.

Either way, could you say in the docstring that forcing an oriented graph will result in "some arbitrary orientation" to be picked?

> Ha right. I always forgot that I am not doing graph theory with my graph with one vertex and three edges ;-)

Of course not.

Helloooooo !

I added a small commit at `public/18440` with superficial changes. And I have
three remarks:

- You say in the documentation of `incidence_matrix` that a digraph cannot be
  recovered from its incidence matrix, which sounds rather unexpected for
  someone like me. That's the usual problem again: for me (and many others) a
  digraph is simple unless stated otherwise. Could you say that 'it is not
  possible to recover the loops of a digraph from its incidence matrix' instead?

- Documentation of `oriented` in the `INPUT section: you do not exactly specify
  what the default behaviour is. It is implicitly done in the paragraphs before
  the 'INPUT' section. Could you say (unless you find something better) that
  when equal to `None` it is inferred from the graph's type?

- It is a bit weird that an error is reported when loops=False but a loops is
  present in the matrix, while multiple edges are silently ignored when
  multiedges=False. I we stick to the behaviour of `add_edge` those edges should
  be silently ignored (and with deprecation #15706 that should be the standard
  some day). What about doing the same here?

- Could you doctest the new exceptions you added?

Thanks,

Nathann
