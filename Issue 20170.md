There is a problem with the copy of the script directory on the server

```
sage: magma=Magma(...) # custom server config
sage: magma('1')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Can't open package spec file ... for reading (No such file or directory)
```


The solution might be to create the directory remotely if it does not exist. Something like

```
os.system("ssh SERVE 'mkdir -p THE_GOOD_DIR'")
```

This ticket is independent of #20388... It won't work unless Magma is installed locally. Once #20388 is merged this should be rebased, I guess...

Indeed, #20388 is merged in the last beta and I was able to use magma.

However

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 + 2)
sage: I = K.ideal(5)
sage: I._magma_init_(magma)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Error evaluating Magma code.
IN:_sage_[3]:=SageCreateWithNames(PolynomialRing(_sage_ref1),["x"]);
OUT:
In file "/home/delecroi/tmp/data//sage/basic.m", line 104, column 6:
>>   if IsPrimeField(X) then
        ^
Runtime error: Undefined reference 'IsPrimeField' in package "/home/delecroi/tmp/data//sage/basic.m"
```
