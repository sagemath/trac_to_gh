`giac` and some other packages can fail to build via `make giac` if Sage is using system versions of `openblas` and `gsl`. Doing `make toolchain` first fixes this, so we add `toolchain` to the dependencies.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30723

So: should we add `toolchain` to dependencies for individual packages, or add `toolchain` to the definition of `BLAS` and `MP_LIBRARY`?
