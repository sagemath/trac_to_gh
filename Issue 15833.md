# Issue 15833: Python 3 preparation: Some functions (ifilter, imap, izip) are removed from itertools

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-04-07 08:43:09

Keywords: python3

The tool 2to3 removes the imports. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import filter` and to check where a wrapping with `list()` is required.

There are 13 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Added dependency: The imports may only be removed when their usages have been removed in #16071.

There is no longer any ifilter to take care of.

For imap, see tickets #21364 and #21373

and for izip, see #21374
