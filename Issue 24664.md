For the record i am not sure if this example alone show a bug in pandoc as pandoc seems to work in utf-8 by default (https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#character-encoding). \\
Pandoc don't seem to claim to keep the input encoding. In your exemple doing `readme.decode('utf-8')` instead of `readme.decode()` works fine.

On ubuntu 16.4 with pandoc 1.16.0.2 `sage -i notedown` works fine (sage version 8.2.beta7)

I never claimed that it was a bug in pandoc. The commands are extracted from the `setup.py` and produce an error on my computer. As specified in [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.decode) the behavior of `decode` depends on some default encoding that might differ between platforms.

Replacing `readme.decode()` with `readme.decode('utf-8')` in `setup.py` solves the problem mentioned in the description. However, I am not sure that utf-8 characters are encouraged in the `long_description` argument of the `setup` (there is no way to specify encoding there).
