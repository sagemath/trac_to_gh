In case of a problem with the sagetex install, one ends up with this:


```
...
sagetex.VersionError: versions of .sty and .py files do not match.
2016-09-08-060257.sagetex.sage was generated by sagetex.sty version "2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de", but
is being processed by sagetex.py version "2015/08/26 v3.0-92d9f7a".
Please make sure that TeX is using the sagetex.sty
from your current version of Sage; see
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html.
```


However, that link currently redirects to another link, which breaks.   

I searched the install guide for sagetex and found nothing: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/search.html?q=sagetex&check_keywords=yes&area=default

So no clue what to do...

The bad link is not in the [SageMath](SageMath) repository, but in SageTeX. I've opened a [pull request](https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/pull/5) to fix that.

The link you're looking for is http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html

Dan is not actively developing SageTeX right now, I think ... Note that there is also at least one bad link in Sage itself, see [the SageTeX tutorial part](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html).  Maybe we should advertise https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex more - I will try to ask him offlist about adding people or even adding it to the [SageMath](SageMath) GH organization, if that is possible.

See #22499 for putting this in the Sage repo.  Alternately, one could take a fork and add this to the [SageMath](SageMath) organization on Github, but this seems easier in the long run since it doesn't have a lot of use outside of Sage (yet).

Changing keywords from "" to "sagetex".

SageTeX is now in the Sage repo at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex so an update of that package ought to do it.

Instead of being dependent upon, this is a dependency of that ticket.

This might also be fixed by fixing https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/issues/17

(This removal/move happened in #18405, incidentally.)

I think there is *still* a reference to the `installation` guide in SageTeX 3.1, but there is no longer any reference to this there.  Is that true beyond the README but also the install script?  I couldn't find that in the very brief `spkg-install`.

This has been fixed upstream (and some related issues have been fixed as well) so once #27024 is in this can be closed.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2019-06-11 12:59:46

That was merged a while ago so this can be closed.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
