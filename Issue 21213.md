In case of a problem with the sagetex install, one ends up with this:


```
...
sagetex.VersionError: versions of .sty and .py files do not match.
2016-09-08-060257.sagetex.sage was generated by sagetex.sty version "2012/01/16 v2.3.3-69dcb0eb93de", but
is being processed by sagetex.py version "2015/08/26 v3.0-92d9f7a".
Please make sure that TeX is using the sagetex.sty
from your current version of Sage; see
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/sagetex.html.
```


However, that link currently redirects to another link, which breaks.   

I searched the install guide for sagetex and found nothing: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/search.html?q=sagetex&check_keywords=yes&area=default

So no clue what to do...

The bad link is not in the [SageMath](SageMath) repository, but in SageTeX. I've opened a [pull request](https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/pull/5) to fix that.

The link you're looking for is http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html

See #22499 for putting this in the Sage repo.  Alternately, one could take a fork and add this to the [SageMath](SageMath) organization on Github, but this seems easier in the long run since it doesn't have a lot of use outside of Sage (yet).

I think there is *still* a reference to the `installation` guide in SageTeX 3.1, but there is no longer any reference to this there.  Is that true beyond the README but also the install script?  I couldn't find that in the very brief `spkg-install`.
