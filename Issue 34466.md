Please also correct a grammar mistake (that was already there) in one of the lines that you changed:

Thanks. Everything looks fine to me. 

I will try to run `maketestlong`. If that works and there are no comments from anyone else, then I will plan to set to positive review tomorrow.

you can also just wait for the github actions to finish and then the "tags" will hopefully turn green

Changing keywords from "" to "lgtm".

The PR removes the file `.lgtm.yml`, deletes mention of `lgtm` from `src/doc/en/developer/tools.rst`, and fixes some minor spacing issues. None of this should cause problems. This was confirmed by `Build & Test` (which passed), and I ran `make testlong` with no errors.
