This branch is made to check what would break if we remove the old-style coercion model.

Leave the ticket in `needs_review` state such that the patchbot will test it.

A reminder: This sage-feature ticket is tested by the patchbot hades only because hades is running a customized patchbot which also fetches sage-feature tickets. Normal patchbots do not test sage-feature tickets.
