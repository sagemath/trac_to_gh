We can remove the `mp.c.patch` from PARI if we make an extra call to `init_memory_functions`.

Looks good to me and all tests pass.  You didn't specifically mention the "GMP internals" part of the patch, but I'm convinced that this can safely be removed, too.

True, but that was just a patch added because at some point because somebody thought there was a bug in that code when there actually wasn't.
