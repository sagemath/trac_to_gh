This is nice:


```
g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
graph_editor(g)
```


but this would be even better:

```
g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
g.edit()
```


It could also fit into a framework where we have "edit" methods for all kinds of objects in Sage, including matrices, elliptic curves, etc.,.   These could be implemented using `@`interact in many cases.
