There now seems to remain 2 failures about comparison to 0. Maybe there lacks a `__bool__` method ?

Nitpick:

```diff
-        - ``other`` - a BruhatTitsHarmonicCocycles class.
+        - ``other`` -- a BruhatTitsHarmonicCocycles class
```


```diff
-        - ``other`` - another space of `p`-automorphic forms.
+        - ``other`` -- another space of `p`-automorphic forms
```

Otherwise LGTM.
