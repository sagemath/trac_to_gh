```
sage: Hom(ProjectiveSpace(3), ProjectiveSpace(1))
Set of points of Projective Space of dimension 1
over Integer Ring defined
over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2, x3
over Integer Ring
```

Now (in Sage-5.1.beta0) we get

```
sage: Hom(ProjectiveSpace(3), ProjectiveSpace(1))
Set of morphisms
  From: Projective Space of dimension 3 over Integer Ring
  To:   Projective Space of dimension 1 over Integer Ring
```

which is more sensible. So this ticket can be closed.
