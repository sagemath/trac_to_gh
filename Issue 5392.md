# Issue 5392: relative number field subfield method -- unclear documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5392

Original creator: dmharvey

Consider


```
sage: R.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - 2*x^2 - 1)
sage: S.<i> = R.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: S.subfield(a + i/a)
```


The S.subfield method documentation says that it constructs QQ(alpha), but this is false, I think it constructs R(alpha). In the above example, S.subfield(a + i/a) returns a number field of degree 8 over Q, whereas a + i/a has degree 4 over QQ (the minimal polynomial is `x^4 - 4x^2 + 8`).

The reviewer patch needs a proper commit message, use `hg qrefresh -e` for this.

It has a proper commit message now. So assuming this is the same patch, I'll put this to positive review again.
