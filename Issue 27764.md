The deprecated name should be doctested..

Oh, I'm sorry I did not knew that.
How should the doctest be, like the one pushed?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-06-18 07:20:07

No problem.

Just add a `TESTS::` section in the new-named method, with a doctest calling the deprecated name.

ok, it's good as it is

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.

OK I think the `TESTS::` variant is nicer, I'll change it accordingly.

Hmm, it is generally not recommended to make changes after positive review, unless there is a very good reason..

OK than we'll keep it like this.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were _actually_ included, especially when closing tickets.
