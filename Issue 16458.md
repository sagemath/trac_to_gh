CC:  dkrenn kcrisman

Keywords: documentation, assumptions, assume

The file `src/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py` was not part of the reference manual; therefore, the documentation of the global function `assume()` etc. was not in the reference manual.

See the discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pb5C1xPTU7c .

This simple patch adds it to `reference/calculus`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16695

Yeah, doesn't even seem to need much sprucing up - maybe changing to `:trac:`12345`` format or something.  Possibly putting some of the `GenericDeclaration` info where it will be seen (underscore methods aren't in the reference manual, including `init`)...  I don't have access to actually testing this builds properly in the manual but seems like the right move!
