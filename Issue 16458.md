# Issue 16458: Add src/sage/symbolic/assumptions to the reference manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16695

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-07-21 15:00:33

CC:  dkrenn kcrisman

Keywords: documentation, assumptions, assume

The file `src/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py` was not part of the reference manual; therefore, the documentation of the global function `assume()` etc. was not in the reference manual.

See the discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pb5C1xPTU7c .

This simple patch adds it to `reference/calculus`.

Yeah, doesn't even seem to need much sprucing up - maybe changing to `:trac:`12345`` format or something.  Possibly putting some of the `GenericDeclaration` info where it will be seen (underscore methods aren't in the reference manual, including `init`)...  I don't have access to actually testing this builds properly in the manual but seems like the right move!

I have made little tweaks to the doc, including

* copied some doc from `_init_` to the class `GenericDeclaration`
* used twice the trac role `:trac:` to link to tickets
* a few other minor change

This seems to be a brand-new branch not including my minimalistic branch. Therefore, it seems that `assumptions.py` is _not_ included into the reference manual. If there a reason for that or is it a simple oversight?

Oops, sorry, looks like I have made a mistake. Should I take care of that, or are you going to do it ?

I merged my old branch so that the changes now actually show up in the reference manual. I reviewed your changes and amended a few details.

I added two minor fixes. Hope it's OK if I set positive?
