The following line slowly expands memory usage:

```
sage: while True: _=sin(x).simplify()
```

The problem is that this uses the string interface to maxima, which creates symbols of the form `$SAGE34` with increasing numeric part. This is a memory leak in Common Lisp, because these symbols get interned.

The current branch solves the problem by augmenting the "variable clear" function with an "unintern" of the corresponding lisp symbol. It seems to work OK, but I'm not 100% sure whether it's safe to do so. If one ends up deleting a symbol that is used elsewhere in expressions, then uninterning the symbol could lead to very funny situations: the next time the symbol gets created from a string, a new (interned) symbol would be created, leading to two distinct symbols with identical print names.

```
from sage.libs.ecl import ecl_eval
def ecl_symbols():
    return set(ecl_eval("""(let ((lst ())) (do-all-symbols (s lst) (push s lst)) lst)"""))
A = ecl_symbols()
while True:
   _= sin(x).simplify()
   B = ecl_symbols()
   print B.difference(A)
   A= B
```

This looks like the right fix to me. Perhaps this could be stress tested using sage-manifolds?

FWIW, I've just checked it on the notebook https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr_Newman.ipynb, which is quite CPU demanding. Everything is fine! Thanks.
