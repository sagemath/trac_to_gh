I have no idea. I just know the test break because I regularly follow Volker's development branch in sage-on-gentoo and it came up in the failed doctests. I didn't do it because I have a particular interest in the area.

The test was wrong as the method is `is_uniform`, not `is_regular`. So I would keep the change for the test but also change the error message.

Just to make sure, you suggest that `is_uniform` will raise `ValueError: This incidence structure has no blocks.` (when the hypergraph is empty). Right?
