This is probably due to #18494 but needs to be investigated further.

Steps to reproduce:

```
git checkout 551d0f0ab9c7942e4d8d61bc2f18808011698dfb  # ticket 18746
make
git checkout 6.8.beta6
make
```

this gives

```

So i see you are switching to only using `data_files` and the only headers to be considered are those found in `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` which makes sense as all the useful headers will be copied. 

Is the issue only happening when one does an upgrade or a re-build where as your commit suggest we may have obsolete `.pxd`, `.pyx` or `.h` files being kept while they should have been deleted?

Yes, if we delete a `.pxd` file from the sources, it should also be deleted from the installation directory.
