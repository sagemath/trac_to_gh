(
[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

Some quick comments (I haven't had time to fully read through it): You need to change `MATH::` -> `.. MATH::`. Also, there are some PEP8 spacing that would be good to implement; mainly the `==0` -> `== 0` and similar.

Which one is better?\\
1)`a==b and c==d`\\
2)`a == b and c == d`
I tend to 1) since it 
is the analogue of `a*b + c*d` vs `a * b + c * d`

That is an interesting point with `and` being another operator. However, I would still say 1 because it seems to be what is most widely used (and I am so used to seeing it that way, but that is my personal bias).

come on guys, there are some `OUTPUT::` lurking around ! Please look at the patchbot complaints.

Hi you are right of course, I should have waited for a green bot. 
Let's do that.

Now there is a morally green patchbot.
