For me, on one machine it happens each time I run `make ptestlong` unless I delete `~/.sage/timings*` before doing so.  (Deleting these files "disables" the IMHO useless and rather counter-productive *sorting of doctests by previous runtime*.)

John C. reported it happened to him even with `make testlong`, i.e., without testing in parallel.

Well, whether `ulimit` works depends on the OS AFAIK.

And as I said, I do not even get a "Killed" from Sage; the doctest passes even though its child process got killed.

I haven't yet been able to reproduce this other than by running `make ptestlong`;  `./sage -tp --long --warn-long 0.0001 src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/` for example doesn't show the behaviour even on an already loaded machine.

Vaguely thought of that already, and we indeed need (GNU) `make`, and a sufficiently old one:

```sh
echo "WARNING:  'gp' may eat up up to ~16GB with the following"
(ulimit -v 16000000; printf "all:\n\t./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py\n" | make -f -)
```


With `make` 3.81, `gp` runs amok; with `make` 4.1, everything's fine.

(We had a similar issue with ECL and/or GAP quite a while ago IIRC, and the `make` version without issues was 3.82 and later I think.)

In case it's really GNU make's fault: [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010)

Fixed in 3.82, as I guessed.

Note that not just Ubuntu 10.04, but also 12.04 and even 14.04!!! (just checked and couldn't believe) still come with the dead old and broken version 3.81 of 2006.

Hmmm, I'm still not sure whether it's really this.  Ubuntu apparently patched their `make`, as it does **not** touch the resource limits, while my GNU make 4.1 limits the stack size to 8MB (soft):

```sh
for make in /usr/local/bin/make /usr/bin/make; do $make --version | head -1; printf "all:\n\t: ; ulimit -sH\n\t: ; ulimit -sS\n" | $make -f -; done
GNU Make 4.1
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
8192
GNU Make 3.81
: ; ulimit -sH
unlimited
: ; ulimit -sS
unlimited
```


Another cause could be GNU make 3.81 messing up file descriptors somehow.

What is the `ulimit -s` outside of `make`? I get

```
jdemeyer@tamiyo:~$ ulimit -s
8192
```

so if `make` changes that to `unlimited`, that's [https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22010) indeed.

This is **not** floating point noise

```diff
 sage: pari('intnum(x=0,13,sin(x)+sin(x^2) + x)')
- 85.1885681951527
+ 84.1818153922297
```

The value of the integral computed with gsl is

```
sage: numerical_integral(sin(x)+sin(x^2)+x,0,13)
(85.18856819515268, 1.3572929447036586e-09)
```

So Pari was right up to 10<sup>-11</sup> and now it gets down to 10<sup>-4</sup>. This is not acceptable.

Yep, missed that:  Outside of `make`, the stack size is (already) soft-limited to 8MB, which GNU make 3.81 in the distros resets to `unlimited`.

The original bug report was actually about the opposite:  Changing it from `unlimited` to some huge value.

But the real bug is that (the old) `make` touches the resource limits of (non-`make`) subprocesses at all.

With Sage 6.7.beta3 and GCC 5.1.0 on Linux x86_64, PARI and eclib pass their test suites (Lcalc no longer has one), and ptestlong passes modulo one unrelated test (I already reported for 6.7.beta3 on sage-release).

Also

```sh
(ulimit -s unlimited; ./sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py)
```

works as expected.

Haven't looked very closely at the patches though.

The changed behaviour of PARI's `intnum()` should IMHO be documented, on #18342, where also the doctest could be changed (not just its output).
