# Issue 30246: Deprecate Combinations iterator for itertools/combinations or IntegerListsLex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30483

As reported at

- [Ask Sage question 53225](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53225)

the iterator from `Combinations` hangs.

This ticket is to deprecate it in favour of the faster
`itertools/combinations` or `IntegerListsLex`.

`IntegerListsLex` provides the enumeration in *reverse* lexicographic order. So using this will break the code based on those rank and unrank methods... But using itertools should work.

copy pasting what I tried which creates lots of doctests failures because the ordering is reverse lexicographic:
