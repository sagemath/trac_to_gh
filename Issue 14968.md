# Issue 14968: NSym (NCSF): bugs or weird design decisions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15205

Here are the issues that haven't been deal with in #15164:

* I don't understand why the internal product is implemented in `ncsf_qsym/generic_basis_code.py` rather than `ncsf_qsym/ncsf.py`. Isn't `generic_basis_code.py` for methods shared between QSym and NSym? There is no internal product on QSym.

* This here is a doctest which has been around before me:

```
                sage: N = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
                sage: S = N.complete()
                sage: S.internal_product
                Generic endomorphism of Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field in the Complete basis
```

The output makes no sense: The internal product is not an endomorphism of anything. I understand it is implemented in some weirdly curried form, but then its target should be a Hom space.

* I was trying to overshadow the `verschiebung` function I implemented on a generic NSym basis by a specific implementation on the ribbon basis. So I've added it under `class ElementMethods:` in the `class Ribbon`. But it doesn't get precedence over the generic implementation at runtime! What am I doing wrong? If this can be explained, I'll implement the verschiebung on a few more bases (Psi and Phi both have very simple formulas).

Perhaps something to look at at the upcoming Sage Days.

Hey Darij,

So then what do you want to do on this ticket, fix the internal product? I believe you took care of the Verschiebung on #15476, correct?

Best,

Travis

Hi Travis!

I don't really plan to do anything on the ticket, and I don't think there is anything to be done on it either. I was keeping it around as a mental note to myself to make an NSym II patch once #15476 is merged and the coercion bugs are dead; by now it seems less and less likely to see the latter happen anytime soon, though. I can just as well use my mailbox for that, though.

Greets and happy new year,\\
Darij

I'll also try to keep a mental note about it as well. Happy new year,

Travis
