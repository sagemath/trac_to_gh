CC:  cremona was davidloeffler klui mderickx pbruin

This function in the `sage.modular.modsym.relation_matrix_pyx` takes a set as input, and gives different results depending on the iteration order of the set (which is arbitrary, and often different on Python 2 vs Python 3).

While this in itself is not at all a bug, but a feature of the algorithm, this has far reaching effect on the results of other computations, resulting in tests that fail on Python 3 since the set ordering is definitely not the same (but the same tests could just as easily fail on Python 2 in principle).

Not sure yet what the best approach is to this.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25301

**PLEASE**, opinion from experts of modular symbols is required on the failing doctests!

Tell us if either

(1) the current change only modifies the bases of modular symbols and is harmless. We just need to change the doctests.

or

(2) at least some of the failing doctests are real failures, with bad and wrong answers

The latest commit fixes all but one doctest in sage/modular, the last one being the one I mentioned above in the numerical section.  It is hard to get a new example which works since the code finds a random linear combination of a few Tp for small p, which is different every time -- yet one needs to find one such which has eigenvalues quite close together.  I will come back to this.

I mostly just replaced the expected output with what the actual output now is, after doing some tests to check that the new output is reasonable.  In a few places I adapted the doctest to be just as useful but more canonical.

In my idea, this change should not impact the performance at all. We are just sorting a bunch of pairs of integers, no big deal.

That is just the sort of test I was going to suggest, but 4691 is prime and that is a very special case, so I suggest (as you have the new and old code up and running I think it is easier for you than for me right now) that you also try the following levels:  N with several prime factors (e.g. 2310), larger prime powers, and a combination of the above such as 1680.
