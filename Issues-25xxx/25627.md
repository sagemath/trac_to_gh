Currently, it is returning a (sorted) list.  However, this is not good when trying to iterate through the linear extensions of slightly larger posets.

I do not understand. "Currently, it is returning a (sorted) list.", but already

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()`

takes about zero time, whereas

`_ = list(posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions())`

takes at least a minute, and for example

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()[2000]`

takes a fraction of a second. So, this seems to already be an iterator.

Currently, `P.linear_extensions()` returns a class, with some (rather little) initialisations done.  This class has a `__list__` method, which triggers the actual computation.

But clearly there is some kind of "iterator" used here, as we can ask for example tenth linear extension without generating the whole list. In a quick look it seems that `generate_linear_extensions` gives kind of "implicit iterator", as it computes "next" linear extension in some order of extensions.

But is it so that current implementation eats memory, i.e. already "used" extensions are not released from the memory? If so, then I understand this.

You are simply interrupting the computation in `posets.AntichainPoset(10).linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.list()`.

You can see this as follows: in a fresh session (!!!) do the same as before, that is, interrupt

```
sage: P = posets.AntichainPoset(10)
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
then again

```
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
which will yield

```
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
Then check that

```
sage: P.linear_extensions().cardinality()
3628800
```
Finally:

```
sage: len(P.linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.linear_extensions)
```
which will tell you a smaller number.  And indeed

```
sage: P.linear_extensions()[3628800-1]
```
will give an error (after a while, because lists are copied all the time).

I'm hoping it will eventually be as easy as changing the end of the `move()` and `switch()` methods to be yield statements, and make the `list()` method an `_iter_()` method.

One potential problem that could arise by changing things is if any other code relies on linear extensions of a poset being generated in lexicographic order. The algorithm itself does not generate them in lexicographic order, but the current implementation makes it appear that way to the user since the entire list is generated and then sorted before being iterated over.

Some things:

- It is better practice to copy the dag on input rather than at `_prepare` as it is possible to pass the dag in, modify the dag, and then run `_prepare`. It also means that it will never have an inconsistent state by having linear extensions for a dag that is not its `self.dag`.

- Errors are not full sentences by Python conventions:
  {{{#!diff
-ValueError("The digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions.")
+ValueError("the digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions")
  }}}

- The result is no longer cached. So if this is called repeatedly for the same dag, this could be slower. I think your change is okay, but it might have unintended consequences in terms of speed. Did you check this?

Because `Parent` does not have an `__eq__` method (so it defaults to compare by id, which is obviously false).

> Also, maybe it would be better to deprecate the class `LinearExtensions` completely, the class `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` should be a good replacement (and might be renamed `LinearExtensions`).


`LinearExtensions` was serving as an iterator object that yielded low level objects. Now this is done by your cython iterator. So +1 for deprecating it, -1 from saying `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` is a replacement.

Also, I have a general -1 on all of those `sorted`. They should not be necessary, and within code, they can be (relatively) expensive when not needed.

I am now removing the sorted from the doctests, but I must say that I think this is wrong, for the following reasons:

* it saves no time (because sorting a list of 4 elements is not very costly)

* it makes the doctests less expressive: adding the `sorted` also tells the user not to rely on the order

* it creates a lot of work and larger diffs.

I am totally with you to remove the sorted from the methods, however.
