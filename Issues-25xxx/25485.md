I somewhat agree that it is weird that `reduced_word` outputs a list while `reduced_words` outputs tuples.

On the other hand, it seems to me that tuples would be more reasonable altogether because a reduced word is something that "cannot be changed by hand". But I also see that the `list` features might be used in rather many places in main Sage and probably even more in personal code.

It is mutable output, therefore should not be a `cached_method`.

I am also being wary of an over-reliance on caching things, which can lead to memory leaks (nearly everything for this implementation is cached, which I am not saying it does give a memory leak, but it does bloat the memory usage.)
