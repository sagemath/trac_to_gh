The reason I added the `cached_method` was the situation that I want to compute all reduced words of all elements in a group. I find it unreasonable to to explicitly compute the braid relations for each element again (which might take much more time than computing the orbit).

Just checked, it is an overhead of 10%.

It is mutable output, therefore should not be a `cached_method`.

I am also being wary of an over-reliance on caching things, which can lead to memory leaks (nearly everything for this implementation is cached, which I am not saying it does give a memory leak, but it does bloat the memory usage.)

For instance (and I'm not a big user of reduced words), but I looked in some of my files and found random places where code would need to be updated e.g.:

def gen_loops( w ):

```
Simple fix... but I would request that you don't make a change like that unless its necessary.

This is because there are simply **not many** Coxeter groups, so saving such information will never fill up the memory (unless you want to keep zillions of Coxeter groups in memory together with tons of their elementary information). It is a totally different situation for element methods where it is much more crucial to keep track of which information should be kept in memory and which should rather be recomputed per default.\n\nThis being said, I don't care enough here, so I simply removed the `chached_method`.",
