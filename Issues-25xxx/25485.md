The reason I added the `cached_method` was the situation that I want to compute all reduced words of all elements in a group. I find it unreasonable to to explicitly compute the braid relations for each element again (which might take much more time than computing the orbit).

Just checked, it is an overhead of 10%.

It is mutable output, therefore should not be a `cached_method`.

I am also being wary of an over-reliance on caching things, which can lead to memory leaks (nearly everything for this implementation is cached, which I am not saying it does give a memory leak, but it does bloat the memory usage.)

Its not important, but why mess up people's code with random unnecessary changes?  The `reduced_words` code has been in Sage for a long time and the choice was made that it would return lists.  For instance (and I'm not a big user of reduced words), but I looked in some of my files and found random places where code would need to be updated e.g.:

```
def gen_loops( w ):
    R = w.reduced_words()
    if w==G.first():
        return [(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)]
    return map(tuple,[w1 + list(reversed(w2)) for w1 in R for w2 in R if w1[-1]!=w2[-1]])
```
Simple fix... but I would request that you don't make a change like that unless its necessary.
