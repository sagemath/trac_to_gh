I somewhat agree that it is weird that `reduced_word` outputs a list while `reduced_words` outputs tuples.

On the other hand, it seems to me that tuples would be more reasonable altogether because a reduced word is something that "cannot be changed by hand". But I also see that the `list` features might be used in rather many places in main Sage and probably even more in personal code.

The reason I added the `cached_method` was the situation that I want to compute all reduced words of all elements in a group. I find it unreasonable to to explicitly compute the braid relations for each element again (which might take much more time than computing the orbit).

Just checked, it is an overhead of 10%.

It is mutable output, therefore should not be a `cached_method`.

I am also being wary of an over-reliance on caching things, which can lead to memory leaks (nearly everything for this implementation is cached, which I am not saying it does give a memory leak, but it does bloat the memory usage.)

For instance (and I'm not a big user of reduced words), but I looked in some of my files and found random places where code would need to be updated e.g.:

Simple fix... but I would request that you don't make a change like that unless its necessary.
