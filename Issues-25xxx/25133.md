<a id='comment:20'></a>Thank you Darij and Travis for your hard work!

Some other bases that would be nice to code, if you guys have time - these are the sums of M's over some order on ordered set partitions, so maybe the only work is to code the orders:
- Q basis of Bergeron-Zabrocki (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509265 start of section 6);
- The fundamental and multiplicative bases from Novelli-Thibon (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605061 lines 55-56; section 2.6 and line 47).
- Their dual bases in the dual of WQSym.

Let me know if I can help. (But I'm in an antipodal timezone from you.)
