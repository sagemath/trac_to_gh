NumPy 1.15.2 was released.

- [NumPy releases](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases)

**Tarball**: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/45/ba/2a781ebbb0cd7962cc1d12a6b65bd4eff57ffda449fdbbae4726dc05fbc3/numpy-1.15.2.zip

Our last upgrade was to NumPy 1.13.3 in #24063.

A bug introduced in NumPy 1.15 prevents building NumPy on machines with many CPUs.

The issue is reported and solved upstream:

- [NumPy issue 12087](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12087)
- [NumPy pull request 12088](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12088)


CC:  @kiwifb @infinity0 @jdemeyer @slel epalezzato

Keywords: upgrade, numpy

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Reviewer: Travis Scrimshaw

Author: Timo Kaufmann, Julian RÃ¼th, Bryan Gin-ge Chen

Branch: b1516346ac15a136cf8ccdf99429feb799f4754f

Resolution: fixed

Its mostly formatting. Interesting bits:

- [here](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/276be14b387f7f8f98eba05ecddeccb5ec8b8ef7/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/numpy-1.14.3.patch#L119) I avoid a numpy deprecation warning (empty array should not be used as false) by always making sure points is a regular array and then comparing its `len`.
- the `iprint` kwarg in `fmin_cobyla` is [deprecated](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla.html) and repaced by `disp`

Edit: I was a bit too fast and didn't test it properly. I'll post an updated version once thats tested.

This does not happen outside of sage. It probably has something to do with sages custom number types.

`if 'range' in options:` does not work, since that also triggers upon passing `range=None` (which is the default).

What do you suggest? numpy / matplot (which do indeed also throw deprecation warnings) aren't called until either `_render_on_subplot` or `get_minmax_data` are run. I wanted to give the user a notice when they construct the initial `Histogram` object.

`points = list(points)` is necessary to properly treat the case when `points` is a generator or other non-list iterable. Note the test `line(enumerate(range(2)), marker = 'o', legend_label='a')` at line 498 which was apparently added for unrelated reasons in #13690.

I made a change to a string which stated that `normed` was a deprecated alias for `density`. Strictly speaking, `normed` has different (incorrect) behavior from `density` [when constructing a histogram with non-uniform bars](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5adb81051086a45fe3b59ba506b567340ec9bd5e/numpy/lib/histograms.py#L818).

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:44'></a>Hi, thanks for pushing back on this. The code from this ticket indeed works fine with a single point (entered as a tuple, list, or a list containing a single tuple or single list, etc.). \n\nHowever, in the course of testing this, I realized that I did not completely understand the addition of `points = list(points)` in `line2d()` and my answer above to Jeroen was incorrect. Note that this line was actually added by gh-timokau [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/plot/line.py?id=3322ff1a1446cc5d0b8b34b6f7203250df0bdd5c), so I should probably have deferred to him to explain it. \n\nAnyways, here's what I think now. The real reason this line was added was to properly treat `line(numpy.array([]))` (which is one of the doctests). The previous version of `line2d` used the more pythonic-looking `if not points:` to detect \"no points\". As of numpy 1.15, the truth value of `numpy.array([])` is still `False`, but it returns a DeprecationWarning that this behavior will be removed.\n\nSo to get around this, gh-timokau replaced `if not points:` with the `points = list(points)` and `if len(points) == 0`.\n\nTwo observations:\n\n- The test `if points in CC or points in CDF:` now always fails.\n\n- `xydata_from_point_list()` [already has this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/e8633b09919542a65e7e990c8369fee30c7edefd/src/sage/plot/plot.py#L777):\n\n```\nif not isinstance(points, (list, tuple)):\n    points = list(points)\n```\n\nFor the first point, I think we should just remove this test altogether, since it looks like it was originally there to catch some edge cases for `if not points:` (e.g. `points=CC(0)`).

<a id='comment:44'></a>Hi, thanks for pushing back on this. The code from this ticket indeed works fine with a single point (entered as a tuple, list, or a list containing a single tuple or single list, etc.). 

However, in the course of testing this, I realized that I did not completely understand the addition of `points = list(points)` in `line2d()` and my answer above to Jeroen was incorrect. Note that this line was actually added by gh-timokau [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/plot/line.py?id=3322ff1a1446cc5d0b8b34b6f7203250df0bdd5c), so I should probably have deferred to him to explain it. 

Anyways, here's what I think now. The real reason this line was added was to properly treat `line(numpy.array([]))` (which is one of the doctests). The previous version of `line2d` used the more pythonic-looking `if not points:` to detect "no points". As of numpy 1.15, the truth value of `numpy.array([])` is still `False`, but it returns a DeprecationWarning that this behavior will be removed.

So to get around this, gh-timokau replaced `if not points:` with the `points = list(points)` and `if len(points) == 0`.

Two observations:

- The test `if points in CC or points in CDF:` now always fails.

- `xydata_from_point_list()` [already has this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/e8633b09919542a65e7e990c8369fee30c7edefd/src/sage/plot/plot.py#L777):

```
if not isinstance(points, (list, tuple)):
    points = list(points)
```

For the first point, I think we should just remove this test altogether, since it looks like it was originally there to catch some edge cases for `if not points:` (e.g. `points=CC(0)`). One somewhat related thing that I noticed was that symbolic complex input is not handled well: `line([1+I,I])` doesn't work but `line([CC(1+I),CC(I)])` does. Maybe this should be dealt with in another ticket for `xydata_from_point_list` though.

The second point gives me pause. Is there a cleaner way to detect both an empty list and an empty numpy array in `line2d`? I'd appreciate suggestions, as I don't see anything nice at the moment. It does seem like [dealing with empty numpy arrays](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9381545/) is a common pain point. 

The current code does work so we could also just go with what we have.
