NumPy 1.15.2 was released.

- [NumPy releases](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases)

**Tarball**: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/45/ba/2a781ebbb0cd7962cc1d12a6b65bd4eff57ffda449fdbbae4726dc05fbc3/numpy-1.15.2.zip

Our last upgrade was to NumPy 1.13.3 in #24063.

A bug introduced in NumPy 1.15 prevents building NumPy on machines with many CPUs.

The issue is reported and solved upstream:

- [NumPy issue 12087](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12087)
- [NumPy pull request 12088](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12088)


CC:  @kiwifb @infinity0 @jdemeyer @slel epalezzato

Keywords: upgrade, numpy

For NumPy 1.13.3 we have the tarball in .zip, should we also use the .zip this time or the .tar.gz?

I don't know how or if I can add changes here, but I have fixed the doctests for the numpy+scipy upgrade [here](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/276be14b387f7f8f98eba05ecddeccb5ec8b8ef7/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/numpy-1.14.3.patch).

Its mostly formatting. Interesting bits:

- [here](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/276be14b387f7f8f98eba05ecddeccb5ec8b8ef7/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/numpy-1.14.3.patch#L119) I avoid a numpy deprecation warning (empty array should not be used as false) by always making sure points is a regular array and then comparing its `len`.
- the `iprint` kwarg in `fmin_cobyla` is [deprecated](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla.html) and repaced by `disp`

Edit: I was a bit too fast and didn't test it properly. I'll post an updated version once thats tested.

I've done most of the upgrade, but two failures in `src/sage/plot/histogram.py` remain. I think both are rooted in the following issue:

```
> import numpy
> numpy.histogram([], range=(1.0,1.0))

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-05b803a2f80b> in <module>()
----> 1 numpy.histogram([], range=(RealNumber('1.0'),RealNumber('1.0')))

/home/timo/repos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/histograms.pyc in histogram(a, bins, range, normed, weights, density)
    674     a, weights = _ravel_and_check_weights(a, weights)
    675 
--> 676     bin_edges, uniform_bins = _get_bin_edges(a, bins, range, weights)
    677 
    678     # Histogram is an integer or a float array depending on the weights.

/home/timo/repos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/histograms.pyc in _get_bin_edges(a, bins, range, weights)

    343         # with it throughout.
--> 344         bin_type = np.result_type(first_edge, last_edge, a)
    345         if np.issubdtype(bin_type, np.integer):
    346             bin_type = np.result_type(bin_type, float)

TypeError: data type not understood
```

This does not happen outside of sage. It probably has something to do with sages custom number types.

The point of the test seems to be to check the `normed` option; note that the first example in the docstring is essentially identical except it uses `density`.

I thought about just deleting the test, but I figured I'd ask first.

The new way is to use the `density` option, but Sage wants to give its users some time
to adapt, so keeps `normed` working but with a deprecation warning.

The test should check that the deprecation warning works. Please adapt it to do that.

For examples of deprecation warnings in doctests, see:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=deprecationwarning

After a year, the deprecated stuff can be removed.

`if 'range' in options:` does not work, since that also triggers upon passing `range=None` (which is the default).

What do you suggest? numpy / matplot (which do indeed also throw deprecation warnings) aren't called until either `_render_on_subplot` or `get_minmax_data` are run. I wanted to give the user a notice when they construct the initial `Histogram` object.

`points = list(points)` is necessary to properly treat the case when `points` is a generator or other non-list iterable. Note the test `line(enumerate(range(2)), marker = 'o', legend_label='a')` at line 498 which was apparently added for unrelated reasons in #13690.

I made a change to a string which stated that `normed` was a deprecated alias for `density`.

I'm also in favor of throwing our own deprecation warning. That we're using numpy under the hood is an implementation detail. This way we have more control.

However, `points = list(points)` is still wrong! The docs for `line2d` state

```
    -  ``points`` - either a single point (as a tuple), a list of
       points, a single complex number, or a list of complex numbers.
```
It's not at all clear to me that calling `list()` on a single point or a single complex number is the right thing to do.

One somewhat related thing that I noticed was that symbolic complex input is not handled well: `line([1+I,I])` doesn't work but `line([CC(1+I),CC(I)])` does. Maybe this should be dealt with in another ticket for `xydata_from_point_list` though.\n\nThe second point gives me pause. Is there a cleaner way to detect both an empty list and an empty numpy array in `line2d`? I'd appreciate suggestions, as I don't see anything nice at the moment.

Hi, thanks for pushing back on this. The code from this ticket indeed works fine with a single point (entered as a tuple, list, or a list containing a single tuple or single list, etc.). 

However, in the course of testing this, I realized that I did not completely understand the addition of `points = list(points)` in `line2d()` and my answer above to Jeroen was incorrect. Note that this line was actually added by gh-timokau [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/plot/line.py?id=3322ff1a1446cc5d0b8b34b6f7203250df0bdd5c), so I should probably have deferred to him to explain it. 

Anyways, here's what I think now. The real reason this line was added was to properly treat `line(numpy.array([]))` (which is one of the doctests). The previous version of `line2d` used the more pythonic-looking `if not points:` to detect "no points". As of numpy 1.15, the truth value of `numpy.array([])` is still `False`, but it returns a DeprecationWarning that this behavior will be removed.

So to get around this, gh-timokau replaced `if not points:` with the `points = list(points)` and `if len(points) == 0`.

Two observations:

- The test `if points in CC or points in CDF:` now always fails.

- `xydata_from_point_list()` [already has this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/e8633b09919542a65e7e990c8369fee30c7edefd/src/sage/plot/plot.py#L777):

```
if not isinstance(points, (list, tuple)):
    points = list(points)
```

For the first point, I think we should just remove this test altogether, since it looks like it was originally there to catch some edge cases for `if not points:` (e.g. `points=CC(0)`). One somewhat related thing that I noticed was that symbolic complex input is not handled well: `line([1+I,I])` doesn't work but `line([CC(1+I),CC(I)])` does. Maybe this should be dealt with in another ticket for `xydata_from_point_list` though.

The second point gives me pause. Is there a cleaner way to detect both an empty list and an empty numpy array in `line2d`? I'd appreciate suggestions, as I don't see anything nice at the moment. It does seem like [dealing with empty numpy arrays](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9381545/) is a common pain point. 

The current code does work so we could also just go with what we have.

A you can see in the first line of `$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/numpy/patches/fix-numpy-1.13.3-for-python3.7.patch`, there is a link to https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10500 which is now fixed (the patch or a similar one was applied upstream), so it sufice to remove that patch. I just did that and recompiled numpy and scipy, but did not run all doctests.

I'll probably start by building there and running just the tests in `inline_fortran.py`. Maybe that's already enough to trigger the error.

I'm not 100% sure I'm looking in the right place but looks like homebrew gcc, version 8.2.0. As far as I know I haven't tried to change to clang for my sage install.

Hum... Not sure. You should open a new ticket in any case. While numpy could be your culprit if numpy arrays are used it could be something else entirely.
