NumPy 1.15.2 was released.

- [NumPy releases](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases)

**Tarball**: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/45/ba/2a781ebbb0cd7962cc1d12a6b65bd4eff57ffda449fdbbae4726dc05fbc3/numpy-1.15.2.zip

Our last upgrade was to NumPy 1.13.3 in #24063.

A bug introduced in NumPy 1.15 prevents building NumPy on machines with many CPUs.

The issue is reported and solved upstream:

- [NumPy issue 12087](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12087)
- [NumPy pull request 12088](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12088)


**CC:**  @kiwifb @infinity0 @jdemeyer @slel epalezzato

**Keywords:** upgrade, numpy

For NumPy 1.13.3 we have the tarball in .zip, should we also use the .zip this time or the .tar.gz?

I don't know how or if I can add changes here, but I have fixed the doctests for the numpy+scipy upgrade [here](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/276be14b387f7f8f98eba05ecddeccb5ec8b8ef7/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/numpy-1.14.3.patch).

Its mostly formatting. Interesting bits:

- [here](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/276be14b387f7f8f98eba05ecddeccb5ec8b8ef7/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/numpy-1.14.3.patch#L119) I avoid a numpy deprecation warning (empty array should not be used as false) by always making sure points is a regular array and then comparing its `len`.
- the `iprint` kwarg in `fmin_cobyla` is [deprecated](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla.html) and repaced by `disp`

Edit: I was a bit too fast and didn't test it properly. I'll post an updated version once thats tested.

I've done most of the upgrade, but two failures in `src/sage/plot/histogram.py` remain. I think both are rooted in the following issue:

```
> import numpy
> numpy.histogram([], range=(1.0,1.0))

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-05b803a2f80b> in <module>()
----> 1 numpy.histogram([], range=(RealNumber('1.0'),RealNumber('1.0')))

/home/timo/repos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/histograms.pyc in histogram(a, bins, range, normed, weights, density)
    674     a, weights = _ravel_and_check_weights(a, weights)
    675 
--> 676     bin_edges, uniform_bins = _get_bin_edges(a, bins, range, weights)
    677 
    678     # Histogram is an integer or a float array depending on the weights.

/home/timo/repos/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/histograms.pyc in _get_bin_edges(a, bins, range, weights)

    343         # with it throughout.
--> 344         bin_type = np.result_type(first_edge, last_edge, a)
    345         if np.issubdtype(bin_type, np.integer):
    346             bin_type = np.result_type(bin_type, float)

TypeError: data type not understood
```

This does not happen outside of sage. It probably has something to do with sages custom number types.

Replying to [gh-timokau](#comment%3A23):

The point of the test seems to be to check the `normed` option; note that the first example in the docstring is essentially identical except it uses `density`.

I thought about just deleting the test, but I figured I'd ask first.

The new way is to use the `density` option, but Sage wants to give its users some time
to adapt, so keeps `normed` working but with a deprecation warning.

The test should check that the deprecation warning works. Please adapt it to do that.

For examples of deprecation warnings in doctests, see:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=deprecationwarning

After a year, the deprecated stuff can be removed.

Thanks for the quick feedback!

`if 'range' in options:` does not work, since that also triggers upon passing `range=None` (which is the default).

What do you suggest? numpy / matplot (which do indeed also throw deprecation warnings) aren't called until either `_render_on_subplot` or `get_minmax_data` are run. I wanted to give the user a notice when they construct the initial `Histogram` object.

`points = list(points)` is necessary to properly treat the case when `points` is a generator or other non-list iterable. Note the test `line(enumerate(range(2)), marker = 'o', legend_label='a')` at line 498 which was apparently added for unrelated reasons in #13690.

I made a change to a string which stated that `normed` was a deprecated alias for `density`. Strictly speaking, `normed` has different (incorrect) behavior from `density` [when constructing a histogram with non-uniform bars](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/5adb81051086a45fe3b59ba506b567340ec9bd5e/numpy/lib/histograms.py#L818).

I'm also in favor of throwing our own deprecation warning. That we're using numpy under the hood is an implementation detail. This way we have more control.

I don't have a strong opinion on the deprecation warning, I was mostly just commenting.

However, `points = list(points)` is still wrong! The docs for `line2d` state

```
    -  ``points`` - either a single point (as a tuple), a list of
       points, a single complex number, or a list of complex numbers.
```
It's not at all clear to me that calling `list()` on a single point or a single complex number is the right thing to do.

Hi, thanks for pushing back on this. The code from this ticket indeed works fine with a single point (entered as a tuple, list, or a list containing a single tuple or single list, etc.). 

However, in the course of testing this, I realized that I did not completely understand the addition of `points = list(points)` in `line2d()` and my answer above to Jeroen was incorrect. Note that this line was actually added by gh-timokau [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/plot/line.py?id=3322ff1a1446cc5d0b8b34b6f7203250df0bdd5c), so I should probably have deferred to him to explain it. 

Anyways, here's what I think now. The real reason this line was added was to properly treat `line(numpy.array([]))` (which is one of the doctests). The previous version of `line2d` used the more pythonic-looking `if not points:` to detect "no points". As of numpy 1.15, the truth value of `numpy.array([])` is still `False`, but it returns a DeprecationWarning that this behavior will be removed.

So to get around this, gh-timokau replaced `if not points:` with the `points = list(points)` and `if len(points) == 0`.

Two observations:

- The test `if points in CC or points in CDF:` now always fails.

- `xydata_from_point_list()` [already has this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/e8633b09919542a65e7e990c8369fee30c7edefd/src/sage/plot/plot.py#L777):

```
if not isinstance(points, (list, tuple)):
    points = list(points)
```

For the first point, I think we should just remove this test altogether, since it looks like it was originally there to catch some edge cases for `if not points:` (e.g. `points=CC(0)`). One somewhat related thing that I noticed was that symbolic complex input is not handled well: `line([1+I,I])` doesn't work but `line([CC(1+I),CC(I)])` does. Maybe this should be dealt with in another ticket for `xydata_from_point_list` though.

The second point gives me pause. Is there a cleaner way to detect both an empty list and an empty numpy array in `line2d`? I'd appreciate suggestions, as I don't see anything nice at the moment. It does seem like [dealing with empty numpy arrays](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9381545/) is a common pain point. 

The current code does work so we could also just go with what we have.

I have no experience with patching so if someone wants fix this themselves rather than explain to me how to do it they're also welcome to do so.

A you can see in the first line of `$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/numpy/patches/fix-numpy-1.13.3-for-python3.7.patch`, there is a link to https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10500 which is now fixed (the patch or a similar one was applied upstream), so it sufice to remove that patch. I just did that and recompiled numpy and scipy, but did not run all doctests.

Any ideas how we could debug this? k8s has 48 cores so we could try to debug this there.

I'll probably start by building there and running just the tests in `inline_fortran.py`. Maybe that's already enough to trigger the error.
