The methods `sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` and `sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygons3d` have the keyword argument "alpha" (as well as the equivalent, outdated "opacity" argument). However it is not passed to the plot function. For example,

```
polygon3d([[1, 2, 3], [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [3,0,0]], color=(0,1,0), alpha=0.5)
```
or 

```
polygon3d([[1, 2, 3], [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [3,0,0]], color=(0,1,0), opacity=0.5)
```
is treated as opacity=1.

Related tickets: 
#21984 
 Update: The argument  "alpha" is equivalent to "opacity" in all the 3d plot functions, such as `point3d`, `line3d`, `sphere`, `icosahedron`, `tetrahedron`, `dodecahedron`, `polygon3d`, `polygons3d`, `bezier3d`, `parametric_plot3d`, `revolution_plot3d`, `arrow3d', etc.
