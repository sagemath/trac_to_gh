Add `all_solutions` method so that one can do:

```python
sage: S = Subsets(range(4))
sage: rows = map(list, S)
sage: dlx = dlx_solver(rows)
sage: dlx
Dancing links solver for 4 columns and 16 rows
sage: dlx.number_of_solutions()
15
sage: sorted([sorted(s) for s in dlx.all_solutions(ncpus=8)])

Why do you set `ncpus=1` as a default? Shouldn't the default just be `None`? During doctests that is going to be "2" which seems to be Ok for doctesting, see `ncpus.py`.

I improved the sentences before some doctests to avoid problems mentionned by saraedum.

I also rewrote `number_of_solutions` method to be like `one_solution` and `all_solutions` methods. I deleted the `_number_of_solutions_iterator` method. After changing `ncpus=1` to `ncpus=None`, there was an infinite loop because `_number_of_solutions_iterator` was calling `number_of_solutions` which was calling  `_number_of_solutions_iterator` again because `ncpus` was not set to 1 by default. I think the code makes more sense like it is now.

The behavior is not different anymore. Reinitialization is performed automatically when needed.

Because before the input was `ncpus=1` :

```diff
-    def number_of_solutions(self, ncpus=1, column=None):
+    def number_of_solutions(self, ncpus=None, column=None):
```

Therefore, the previous doctest with no input was testing the case when `ncpus=1`. Since the new default value for ncpus is `None`, if I want to *avoid* removing a doctest, I need to specifically set `ncpus=1` in the doctest.

If `ncpus` is not equal to `1`, then the parallel code applies which uses `restrict` which temporarily creates new dlx solvers which are used only once before being deleted. So to me, there is no need to test with `ncpus=1`, `ncpus=2` and `ncpus=None`.

Thus, I rechange the status to needs review. Tell me if you insist on this aspect and if you want me to add those doctests.

<a id='comment:31'></a>On Ubuntu, I can not reproduce the issue.

The methods I am adding/modifying to the dancing links class are not used by the sudoku solver which uses directly the `search` and  `get_solution` methods. The only thing I changed that may have affected the sudoku thing is the way the `__init__` is done which is now done with the `reinitalize` method. Maybe OSX does not like the line

```
self._x = dancing_links()
```

that was in the `reinitialize` which was called by the `__init__`? So, I added a new commit which does

```
self._x = dancing_links()
```

only for the reinitialization and avoids it for `__init__` as it was before. Can somebody with OSX test whether this fixes the issue?

<a id='comment:40'></a>Sorry Volker. I was sure that I put sorted everywhere needed, but I forgot one.

Rebased on 8.3.beta2.

I added a commit which added the `sorted` where the doctest problem occurs. I also added two other `sorted` elsewhere.

Needs review.

<a id='comment:45'></a>Thanks for your carefull review Vincent K. We avoided a nuisance to Volker.

The failures you found come from the fact that we change the `ncpus=1` to `ncpus=None` in the `one_solution` method which made deterministic doctests become not deterministic. If the doctest is run with more than one cpu, than the first solution found depend on the speed of the computation made on each cpus.

I made the doctests for `one_solution` independent of the first solution found.

I also added a bunch of `sorted` (even for list of size one!) to prevents other similar problem.

Hopefully, these were the last non deterministic doctests to be fixed.

Needs review.
