Please implement the S and E bases from Novelli-Thibon (​https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605061 section 2.6 and line 47). They are sums of monomials over the pseudo-permutohedron order:

Let p be an ordered set partition.

A pair i<j is a full inversion in p if the block containing i is strictly to the right of the block containing j.

A pair i<j is a half inversion in p if i and j are in the same block.

Two ordered set partitions satisfy u<=v if every full inversion in u is a full inversion in v, and every half inversion in u is a half or full inversion in v.

Then S_u = sum of M_v over v<=u; E_u = sum of M_v over v>=u.

I'm moving the fundamental basis to #25151 since it uses the same order as the Q-basis.

A few observations:

- I think the description of successors in arXiv:math/0605061v1 (between (45) and (46)) is wrong.

- In terms of packed words, the pseudo-permutohedron order can be defined as follows: Two packed words u and v of length n satisfy u <= v if and only if each i < j satisfies (if u_i > u_j, then v_i > v_j) and (if u_i >= u_j, then v_i >= v_j).

- For any packed word w, let comp(w) be the complement of w (that is, replace each letter k by L+1-k, where L is the number of distinct letters of w). Then, two packed words u and v satisfy u <= v if and only if comp(v) <= comp(u). Note that on ordered set partitions, "comp" corresponds to reversing the order of the blocks. Thus, two ordered set partitions P and Q satisfy P <= Q if and only if their reversals rev(P) and rev(Q) satisfy rev(Q) <= rev(P).

- If two ordered set partitions P and Q satisfy P <= Q in pseudo-permutohedron order, then they also satisfy P <= Q in lex order. Thus, unitriangularity can be used in constructing the bases.

- Given an ordered set partition P, how do we find all ordered set partitions Q satisfying P <= Q in pseudo-permutohedron order? Here is an algorithm: First, declare two successive blocks of P to be mergeable if and only if max(left block) < min(right block). There are several ways of merging mergeable pairs of successive blocks. Let R_1, R_2, ..., R_k be the resulting ordered set partitions (note that k is a power of 2). For each i, there are several ways of splitting each block of R_i into several (possibly 1) sub-blocks in such a way that each pair of these consecutive sub-blocks satisfies min(left sub-block) > max(right sub-block). Let Q_{i, 1}, Q_{i, 2}, ..., Q_{i, p_i} be the results (again, p_i is a power of 2). Then, the Q_{i, j} for various i and j are all distinct, and are all the ordered set partitions Q satisfying P <= Q.
