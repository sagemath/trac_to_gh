needs a single colon if there is text afterwards with double-colon.

```
        TESTS::
 
        When the constructor is passed a set, this method is called.  Since

        test::
```
should become

```
        TESTS:
 
        When the constructor is passed a set, this method is called.  Since
        iteration over sets is non-deterministic so too is the results of this
