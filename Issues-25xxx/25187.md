Not sure I remember correctly, but maybe the "TESTS" block
needs a single colon if there is text afterwards with double-colon.

In that case, this block

```
        TESTS::
 
        When the constructor is passed a set, this method is called.  Since
        iteration over sets is non-deterministic so too is the results of this
        test::
```
should become

```
        TESTS:
 
        When the constructor is passed a set, this method is called.  Since
        iteration over sets is non-deterministic so too is the results of this
