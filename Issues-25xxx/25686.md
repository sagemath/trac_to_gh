```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: UCF.is_finite()
True
```

This is explicitly given in the code of universal_cyclotomic_field.py:

```
    def is_finite(self):
        r"""
        Returns ``True``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: UniversalCyclotomicField().is_finite()
            True

        .. TODO::

            this method should be provided by the category.
        """
        return True
```

This has been correct before a change in April 2015 (Trac #1852). It looks like a mistake in connection with that ticket. The old code from git looked like this:



```

-    def is_finite(self):

-        Returns False as ``self`` is not finite.
-
-        EXAMPLES::
-
-            sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
-            sage: UCF.is_finite()

-        """
-        return False
```

Thus the task might be to restore the old code!
