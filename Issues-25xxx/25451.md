Several methods currently in `SetPartition` only make sense for set partitions of {1,...,n}.

As a first step towards resolving this, this tickets moves all the other methods into `AbstractSetPartition`.

It is not clear to me yet, however, how to proceed beyond that.

Replying to [@zabrocki](#comment:4):
> In particular, `strict_coarsenings` raises an error

The problem is simply that this (and other methods) of `AbstractSetPartition` expect `self` to be a `ClonableArray` of `Set`s. This is enforced in `SetPartition.__init__`.

I think one question is what the purpose of `AbstractSetPartition` really is.  It now seems to me that it was intended as a class that allows a different representation of set partitions (eg., as a list of tuples, as in `PartitionDiagram`).

I think it would make sense to have one class for set partitions of {1,...,n}, and another one for general set partitions.  The same goes for perfect matchings, permutations, etc.  But maybe that's not really useful.
