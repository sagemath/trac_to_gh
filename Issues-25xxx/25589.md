<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Actually, we have the same error for any `Graph` build from a complete graph by adding at least one loop or multiple edge. Such graphs are not recognized as cliques.

I prefer to patch the behavior of `vertex_connectivity` rather than changing the behavior of `is_clique`, but this can also be done adding a parameter `to_simple`.
