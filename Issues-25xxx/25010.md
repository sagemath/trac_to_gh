The function principal_directions in ParametrizedSurface3d may produce wrong results when the first fundamental form of the surface is not diagonal, or, more generally when its matrix does not commute with the matrix of the second fundamental form. I think it comes from the fact that the shape operator is constructed to act on the left on vectors but its eigenspaces are computed as if it was acting on the right on vectors.
The following code shows the problem (it is a helicoid with a parametrization such that the first fundamental form is not diagonal):

```
var('u,v',domain='real')
V=vector([u*cos(u+v),u*sin(u+v),u+v])
S=ParametrizedSurface3D(V,(u,v))
dN=S.shape_operator()
U=[(i,j[0]) for i,j,k in S.principal_directions()]# A list with eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

#Check if they are eigenvalues for the left action
[(dN*j-i*j).simplify_full() for i,j in U]

```

Output:



```
[((2*u^2 - (2*u^2 + 1)*sqrt(u^2 + 1) + 1)/(u^4 + u^2), (2*u^2 + 1)/(u^2 + 1)^(3/2)),
 (-(2*u^2 + (2*u^2 + 1)*sqrt(u^2 + 1) + 1)/(u^4 + u^2), (2*u^2 + 1)/(u^2 + 1)^(3/2))]
False
```

```
#Check if they are eigenvalues for the left action
[(j*dN-i*j).simplify_full() for i,j in U]
```
Output:

```
[(0, 0), (0, 0)]
True
```

The solution is simply to replace `eigenvectors_left` by `eigenvectors_right` in the method `principal_directions`. 

It is solved now.
