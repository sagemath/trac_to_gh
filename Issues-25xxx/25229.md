It's hard to figure out for sure what the original intent was here, because the two tests I updated here didn't make sense--the behavior they were testing for was a bug in the first place, which is fixed here.

It seems to me like it *should* work.  From my reading of the code the intent is that, although two `BooleanMonomialMonoids` `M` and `N` were constructed from different instances of `BooleanPolynomialRing`, it should be possible to convert an element of `N` to an element of `M` as long as they share the same variable names.
