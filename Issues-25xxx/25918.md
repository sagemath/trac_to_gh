<a id='comment:14'></a>I get the same error as the patchbot (trivial ordering fix likely due to the new way you are constructing the digraph) in `crystals/kac_modules.py`.

To make this Python3 compatible:

```diff
-w = range(2,j+1) + range(1,j)
+w = list(range(2,j+1)) + list(range(1,j))
```

```diff
-Return enlarged index set.
+Return the enlarged index set.
```
plus the same comment as above. Actually, you want to make this an ``@`cached_method` and return a tuple with how frequently it gets called.

There is no need to call `self[k].weight()` twice:

```diff
-w += self[k].weight()[0] + self[k].weight()[1]
+wt = self[k].weight()
+w = wt[0] + wt[1]
```

This seems inefficient: `n = max(self.index_set())`. Isn't this something you can get from the Cartan type (rather than recomputing it)?

IMO, you are better off writing a little helper function (in Cython) to get `w0` instead of this:

```
           from sage.combinat.permutation import Permutations
           w = Permutations(n+1).long_element().reduced_word()
```

You should define `w` to be a list in `e` and `f`. Similarly define `k` to be an `int` (although you may not want to use `k` to loop over elements in `w`).

```
cdef list w
cdef int k
```
Also, in the `while` loops, you don't want to repeatedly call `len(self)` (as that does not change). You can get a little bit of extra time by pulling that out as a variable.
