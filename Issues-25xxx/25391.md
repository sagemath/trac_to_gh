SageMath 8.3.beta1 building produced 3 different errors when run on Fedora 28 64bit with  gcc 8.1, specifically when building the packages:
- python 3.6.1 (fixed in #25771)
- python 2.7.14 (fixed in #25204)
- linbox 1.5.2  (fixed in #25353)

The 1st error manifests itself as a failure to import the crypt module during the build of Python 3.
It is due to an unspecified issue with Fedora 28 implementation of `crypt()`, which as reported in https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Replace_glibc_libcrypt_with_libxcrypt is not the standard glibc implementation.

This was fixed in https://bugs.python.org/issue32635

Have you run tests on your branch?: `make ptest`
(or `make ptestlong` for more tests)

This is something the ticket's author should do in such cases.

The patch files should also contain some description, at a minimum a link to the upstream issue.

And if you add a patch to a package, you should bump the package version.

Ok, I'm sorry if the description or the execution aren't up to par, this is my first ticket, so I'm getting used to it.\\
The ticket was originally opened to describe the bug. After that, I succeeded in manually fixing all the bugs listed in the description, but it was brought to my attention that two of my bugs were solved in separate tickets at the same time (see the dependencies field), so I merged those tickets and added my own fix for python3, thus fixing all the issues and solving the problem stated in the ticket title, that is [SageMath](SageMath) not compiling on Fedora 28 with gcc 8.1.\\
Since the commits include the fixes for the other 2 bugs, even if by merging, I thought this counted as having a fix for all 3 of them in the branch, is this wrong?\\
There is a description for the python 3 bug, since the bug is literally "Python tries to call crypt instead of crypt_r on Fedora, and this for some reason breaks things, so let's allow it to call crypt_r", and the reason why it breaks things is, as pointed out by dimpase, apparently that fedora has a completely different crypt implementation, as can be seen here https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Replace_glibc_libcrypt_with_libxcrypt.\\
I'll expand on the description a bit, anyway, to make this clearer, and also to reflect the fact that this ticket only directly fixes the python3 bug, since it's only reported in the comments.
I'll also quickly add a description and a link to the patch

Attachment [python3-3.6.1.p1.log](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket25391/python3-3.6.1.p1.log) by @dimpase created at 2018-06-20 16:26:00

The log has a number of tries to build python3, only the one at the bottom of the log has this error, see line 32452:

```
Testing importing of various modules...
ctypes module imported OK
math module imported OK
hashlib module imported OK
./spkg-build: line 157: 21845 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $PYTHON -c "import $module"
crypt module failed to import
readline module imported OK
socket module imported OK
Error: One or more modules failed to import.
```

and this is due to

```
sage/build/python3-3.6.1.p1/src/Modules/_cryptmodule.c: In function 'crypt_crypt_impl':
sage/build/python3-3.6.1.p1/src/Modules/_cryptmodule.c:39:31: warning: implicit declaration of function 'crypt' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
     return Py_BuildValue("s", crypt(word, salt));
                               ^~~~~
```

Basically, there is no `crypt` implementation available in the libraries used, one needs to use another library, and this is done in the branch of this ticket.

To clarify: the upstream's ​https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/4691 does not fix a bug, it provides for using `crypt_r` if available. 

It also does a proper handling (introduces `HAVE_CRYPT_H`) of `crypt` and `crypt_r` at the configuration stage---without it there is a reliance on `glibc` providing `crypt` and a header different from `crypt.h` providing a prototype.

I'm not convinced by this argument. If there would no `crypt` implementation, then we would get a linking error (either at compile time or runtime). But in the log file, there is a segmentation fault. So my impression is that `crypt()` is called but that it's causing a crash somehow.

you are right, my bad here. Anyhow, `crypt` is called without a prototype.
One can in fact make sure that it is called with a prototype, by removing the chunk 
about using `crypt_r` from the branch on this ticket, i.e. the lines

```
+@@ -36,7 +41,13 @@
+ {
+     /* On some platforms (AtheOS) crypt returns NULL for an invalid
+        salt. Return None in that case. XXX Maybe raise an exception?  */
++#ifdef HAVE_CRYPT_R
++    struct crypt_data data;
++    data.initialized = 0;
++    return Py_BuildValue("s", crypt_r(word, salt, &data));
++#else
+     return Py_BuildValue("s", crypt(word, salt));
++#endif
+ }
+ 
+ 
```
perhaps there would be more messages from the compiler then...

This value is then passed to Py_BuildValue and retrieved through varargs, but if one checks the two char* in question, that is the return value of crypt and the one Py_BuildValue retrieves, the latter is almost identical, but with the first 3-4 digits zeroed out. As an example, if crypt returns a pointer to 0xfe5ab234 (I completely made up this address), Py_BuildValue will get a pointer to 0x000ab234, and get illegal memory access when it tries to use it.


If that's true, then the error has nothing to with `crypt()` at all and I would expect much more breakage. Can you post the code that you used to come to the conclusion above and the exact results (no "completely made up" address!).

My understanding is that `crypt` returns a pointer to a statically allocated location. Indeed, its man page says: `return value points to static data whose content is overwritten by each call`.
Whereas `crypt_r` does something else, as such design as for `crypt` is not thread-safe.

Perhaps this unusual design of `crypt` is the reason the breakage is not bigger?

In fact,  the call to `Py_BuildValue`  is

```
return Py_BuildValue("s", crypt(word, salt));
```
(where we see a warning in the logs).

Here `"s"` stands for [string](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html) 
It would be very interesting to see what values of `word` and `salt` are used.
Otherwise what length it assumes by default is anyone's guess (perhaps that's why you see some bits chopped off). Indeed, it does

```
Convert a null-terminated C string to a Python str object using 'utf-8' encoding. 
```

Note that Python 2 does not do `utf-8` here, so this might be a problem.

I meant, certainly, that you modify Jeroen's patch so that you print the **value** of the
pointer `res` (i.e. the address) after the call to crypt(), before printing the 
string it points to (the latter print crashes).

```
While now python outputs this during compilation:

```
[python3-3.6.1.p1] crypt('', '$6$Ukf2OXfG3jHYFFCX')
[python3-3.6.1.p1] Address = '0xc4c020'

```
As you can see, the address is compatible with the theory I presented, that in some way the value of the pointer gets chopped when coming out of crypt. Still no success in stepping into crypt, but I don't see why, it was so easy the first time around...

I don't see how you'd step in a system library in a meaningful way - they usually are stripped, you won't see any symbols.

I have a theory. The `implicit declaration of function 'crypt'` warning causes GCC to guess the return type as `int` (which is 32 bits). Now in reality the return type is `char *` (64 bits). So that might explain the zeroed bits.

If this theory is correct, then simply adding

```
#include <crypt.h>
```
should fix the problem.

Could you try just adding that line to `_cryptmodule.c`?

Or, as I have been saying already, just change the patch you are adding so that it drops `crypt_r` chunk, as it would be precisely the same thing...
Anyhow, this theory is easy to confirm:

```
/* cry.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#ifdef CRYP
#include <crypt.h>
#endif
int main()
{
char *word="blah";
char *salt="foo";
char *res;
res = crypt(word, salt);
printf("%s\n",res);
return 0;
}
```
Now trying this out, with the right include:

```
$ gcc -DCRYP cry.c -lcrypt
$ ./a.out 
fo9NXBQQtNBSA
```
and without include

```
$ gcc cry.c -lcrypt
cry.c: In function ‘main’:
cry.c:10:7: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘crypt’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
 res = crypt(word, salt);
       ^~~~~
cry.c:10:5: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]
 res = crypt(word, salt);
     ^
$ ./a.out 
Segmentation fault
```

Morale: pay attention to compiler warnings :-)
