1. What is the point of having a Python wrapper that is not a Sage matrix class? This is something I don't understand.

2. Why all the inline methods in `ntlwrap.cpp` are needed at all? Cython has very good support for C++ now. The ntl wrappers in Sage are not up to date and would better be cleaned up.

And minor remarks:

3. `for i from 0 <= i < _nrows:` is an old syntax. You would better use `range`.

4. The copyright header

More precisely, you need to choose between:

- Write a complete matrix class whose "backend" would be a NTL c++ class. You would have to inherit from `sage.matrix.matrix_dense.Matrix_dense`. A good example is provided with `Matrix_integer_dense` that wraps FLINT.

- Add some options to the methods of the current matrix classes to call NTL when appropriate. To that purpose, you have to convert the datastructure when needed. Some examples are also provided with `Matrix_integer_dense` that uses `iml` or `linbox`.

I appreciate that this is a little weird, the point is #25366 which is used in #20264, of course in an ideal world I would have implemented a lot more in this ticket. But I thought I would do this as a first step so that those tickets could be added and maybe later see what ntl has to offer sage matrices over Z/nZ more generally.

That's great to hear, I'm not particularly up to date on cython, so I just took existing ntl wrappers and modified them until everything worked.
Is it sufficient to just delete a lot of lines in ntlwrap now? I can of course go through and do this (for other modules also).

Its #25366 that is needed this is a function that has mat_Zz_p's for input and output, which as far as i can tell sage does not currently understand at all. so in reality half of what I'm proposing here is not needed/used right now. But it seemed even less useful to just add the couple of accessors we need.

But it seemed even less useful to just add the couple of accessors we need.\n\nIt is not clear to me why you need a Python wrapper to call a C++ NTL function. Converting a Sage matrix into a NTL `mat_ZZ_p` could be done without Python wrapper. At #24544 you can have a look at `sage/libs/linbox/conversion.pxd` that perform conversions `linbox C++ types <-> Sage types` without any intermediate Python wrapper. It saves a lot of code that boils down to\n\n```\ncdef class my_wrapping_class:\n    def my_method(self):\n        return self.wrapped_object.my_method()\n```\nIf you want to call NTL functions, just provide these conversions.\n\nThe wrapper that is provided in the branch would be useful if it provided an alternative implementation of matrices (see also [comment:5] and [comment:7]). Matrices do accept an implementation keyword and one can imagine an implementation using NTL\n\n```\nsage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2, implementation='gap')\nFull MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_gap)\n```\n\nBut these two purposes are mostly disjoint and I am inclined to think that you are interested in the first situation.",

But it seemed even less useful to just add the couple of accessors we need.

It is not clear to me why you need a Python wrapper to call a C++ NTL function. Converting a Sage matrix into a NTL `mat_ZZ_p` could be done without Python wrapper. At #24544 you can have a look at `sage/libs/linbox/conversion.pxd` that perform conversions `linbox C++ types <-> Sage types` without any intermediate Python wrapper. It saves a lot of code that boils down to

```
cdef class my_wrapping_class:
    def my_method(self):
        return self.wrapped_object.my_method()
```
If you want to call NTL functions, just provide these conversions.

The wrapper that is provided in the branch would be useful if it provided an alternative implementation of matrices (see also [comment:5] and [comment:7]). Matrices do accept an implementation keyword and one can imagine an implementation using NTL

```
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2, implementation='gap')
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_gap)
```

But these two purposes are mostly disjoint and I am inclined to think that you are interested in the first situation.

Yes thats a fair assesment, I suppose I thought it would be most helpful to lay a little groundwork for the latter purpose while doing the former. I would like to look into the alternative approach you suggest when I have some time as it does sound better, but that probably wont happen immediately.

```
it is prefered to put them in the `.pxd` file via distutils directive (to be put on top of the file)

```
# distutils: libraries = ntl gmp m
```
This way, any Cython file that includes the given pxd will be compiled with the appropriate linking.

The same applies to `language` and you could have a look at the various `pxd` files in `sage/libs`.
