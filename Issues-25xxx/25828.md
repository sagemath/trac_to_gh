The last remaining (after #25825) piece of code that uses `is_package_installed` is `OptionalExtension`. Since it only provides the `package` kwarg for convenience, I thought it would make sense to just move to `condition` and add feature checks to use in `module_list.py`.

Moreover, `OptionalExtension(..., package=....)` does not take system packages checked for by `spkg-configure.m4` (#27330) into account.

`setup.py build_cython` is extended by an option `--require-features` for the benefit of distribution builders who want to ensure a predictable build. For example:

```
./sage -sh -c "cd src && sage-python -u setup.py build_cython --require-features=sage.features.databases.DatabaseCremona"
....
sage.features.FeatureNotPresentError: Cremona's database of elliptic curves is not available.
'cremona/cremona.db' not found in any of ['/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local/share']
To install Cremona's database of elliptic curves you can try to run 'sage -i database_cremona_ellcurve'.
Further installation instructions might be available at https://github.com/JohnCremona/ecdata.
```

On the branch is one module for which a feature test is already available (bliss).

- #28175: Move sage optimization backends to separate Cython packages to remove `OptionalExtension` problems
- Follow-up: #28815: Don't pass `SAGE_PKGS` to `src/setup.py`. Replace `OptionalExtension(...., package=....)` by `condition=Feature.is_present()`
