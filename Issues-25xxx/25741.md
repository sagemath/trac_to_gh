sage: R = Integers(10)['x,y,z']['t,s']
sage: t,s = R.gens()
sage: x,y,z = R.base_ring().gens()
sage: %timeit (x+y+2*z*s+3*t)._mpoly_dict_recursive(('z','t','s'))
The slowest run took 8.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.38 ms per loop
```
versus old

```
sage: %timeit (x+y+2*z*s+3*t)._mpoly_dict_recursive(('z','t','s'))
The slowest run took 115.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
```
So currently it has a ~10% speedup.
