Yet another piece of removing the old coercion model...

1. All functions which are only used internally by the old coercion model get two leading underscores or are inlined in another function.

2. All functions which are only called from Cython are changed to a `cdef` function.

3. The public functions `coerce_map_from_c` and `has_coerce_map_from_c` are kept as deprecated alias. The other removed functions already had a leading underscore and are simply removed. As a consequence, there are no longer any public non-deprecated methods in the `parent_old.Parent` class.

4. Remove Python access to the `_has_coerce_map_from` cache.

-2. The public functions `coerce_map_from_c` and `has_coerce_map_from_c` are kept as deprecated alias. The other removed function already had a leading underscore and are simply removed. As a consequence, there are no longer any public non-deprecated methods in the `parent_old.Parent` class.
+2. All functions which are only called from Cython are changed to a `cdef` function.
 
-3. `has_coerce_map_from_c_impl` is removed and folded into `__has_coerce_map_from_c`.
