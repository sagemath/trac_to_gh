Intuitively substitution should replace wildcards in the source expression but this is a separate case in GiNaC. Powers and functions are affected:

```
sage: w=SR.wild(1)
sage: (w^2).subs(w==x)
x
sage: polylog(w,2).subs(w==x)
x
```

GiNaC provides for several flags that can be set with the call to `subs()`, but `Expression.subs()` only sends a zero now. In this case `GiNaC::subs_options::no_pattern = 0x0001` would be needed.
