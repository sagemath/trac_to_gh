This is a problem I started getting just since upgrading to 8.3.rc1.  Which doesn't make any sense because there were very few changes from 8.3.rc0 where I did not see the issue, and the changes do not seem relevant.

So it's possible the problem was introduced earlier, though I'm still not clear why I never noticed it; I did not have any test failures before.

I need to go back a few versions and see if there is still a problem, then maybe bisect to narrow in on it if the problem goes away on an earlier version.  Very strange though.

The problem in the tests starts from

```
File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx", line 552, in sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense._matrix_times_vector_
Failed example:
    A = random_matrix(GF(2),10^4,10^4)
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/Admin/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 573, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/Admin/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 983, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense._matrix_times_vector_[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        A = random_matrix(GF(Integer(2)),Integer(10)**Integer(4),Integer(10)**Integer(4))
      File "/home/Admin/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/special.py", line 601, in random_matrix
        A = copy(parent.zero_matrix())
      File "sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx", line 2316, in sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/cachefunc.c:13466)
        self.cache = f(self._instance)
      File "/home/Admin/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py", line 1663, in zero_matrix
        res = self._matrix_class(self, zero, False, False)
      File "sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx", line 193, in sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense.__cinit__ (build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.c:3746)
        sig_str("matrix allocation failed")
    RuntimeError: matrix allocation failed
```

and from there everything else breaks (at least until that test worker crashes).

Resolution: fixed
