This is a bit ugly, but it seems to be necessary if you want to use `UniqueRepresentation` with subclasses of `Element` (among others) which has the `InheritComparison` metaclass.  This otherwise creates a conflict with `ClasscallMetaclass`.

This class resolves that by making a `UniqueRepresentation` with the `InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass`.  This can then be used as a mix-in class with `Element` subclasses.

There's at least some prior precedence for this, and I've updated those examples to use `InheritComparisonUniqueRepresentation` to demonstrate that it works.  I'm open to better ideas.

There are a couple of reasons why `UniqueRepresentation` should be used sparingly:
- It makes instantiation of an object *expensive*: The construction parameters need to be processed and made into a dictionary key for lookup
- It is very prone to creating memory leaks if the construction parameters consist of anything more complicated than integers and strings. That's because the construction parameters, being put in the key of a global `WeakValueDict`, have their life lower bounded by the object. So if those parameters end up carrying (indirectly) a reference to the object, it's now immortal.
- it means that one has to be very careful caching `UniqueRepresentation` objects: they're already being globally cached (under expensive keys) and the places where one would like to cache them are generally places where that would create the kind of reference loops that cause memory leaks.

The reason why we have `UniqueRepresentation` is because it allows the coercion framework to do lightning-fast comparisons (because we can make do with an "is" test rather than a "=="). It's a compromise that makes memory management with *parents* much more complicated, for the benefit of making some operations with *elements* much faster.

That's why people think it's strange to make elements `UniqueRepresentation`.

That's weird about the memory leaks since I thought the point of using weak reference caching was that you could construct an object once--it would be cached--but then if it isn't used again the cached keys would (potentially) go away.

As for this specific ticket, perhaps the use case of using `UniqueRepresentation` with Elements is not good, though as the diff shows there were still at least a few places where it was useful to define this (unfortunately verbose) `InheritComparisonUniqueRepresentation` class for reuse.

However, my primary motivation to using more `UniqueRepresentation` was actually as a possible solution, in many cases, to #24551.  The reason it appealed to me is that it gives free hashing and equality comparison implementation for classes that have a property that identity of instances of that class is uniquely determined by some attributes of that instance that are provided at its time of construction (particularly via `__init__`).

If `UniqueRepresentation` is not right for this in all cases (something I can believe) then perhaps it would be good to add a new base class that has a similar property, but without caching (and thus without the guaranteed equality-by-id property, which for my use case is not actually so important).  In other words, it would basically generate the same cache key that would be generated by `CachedRepresentation`, but only use that to implement `__eq__` and `__hash__`, but not do any caching.

This kind of leak keeps occurring. See [#23807 comment:14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23807#comment:14) for a recent example.

The `EqualityAndHashingBasedOnConstructionParameters` that you suggest makes a lot more sense: here you get to store the key on the object itself, so memory leaks should be much less of a problem. I suspect it will not be a very memory-efficient class, because the key objects you're storing are likely preserved elsewhere on the object as well.

It would be very surprising if the results were not identical. \n(the fact that the resulting parent is equal to `Qxy` constructed by the user is convenient but less important).

> On that note, could you have a look at #25389 and tell me if the use of `UniqueRepresentation` *doesn't* make sense in any of those cases.

The construction parameters of quaternionalgebras are sufficiently light that I would not expect memory leaks (as long as people don't take to caching quaternion algebras on the base ring!, which now that I thought of it, people will undoubtedly start doing).

In principle, `QuaternionAlgebra` is the kind of parent that could participate in coercion discovery, where `UniqueRepresentation` might be required (in particular, if people consider polynomial ring *over* a ring and expect coercion discovery, and in particular common covering parent construction, to work with it, then `UniqueRepresentation` might be required.

I would find it surprising if people are actually doing that with quaternion algebras, so I don't think we're getting the designed benefit from quaternion algebras.

By turning quaternion algebras into globally unique objects, you are requiring the algebras to be immutable in a very strong sense: different parts could end up having references to the same algebra, so ANY change in state (even little representation/caching details) must be assumed to affect completely unrelated code. It's not possible to make your own little local algebra and scribble in it anymore.

More precisely. The kind of scenario in the coercion framework where I know that `UniqueRepresentation` is really required is to make this assertion hold:

```
sage: Zxy.<x,y>=ZZ[]
sage: Qx.<x>=QQ[]
sage: Qy.<y>=QQ[]
sage: Qxy=QQ['x','y']
sage: x=Qx.0
sage: y=Zxy.1
sage: (x+y).parent() is Qxy
True
sage: Qy.<y>=QQ[]
sage: (Qy.0+Zxy.0).parent() is Qxy
True
```

Note that the coercion framework needs to construct a common covering parent for `Zxy` and `Qx` and one for `Zxy` and `Qy` itself. It would be very surprising if the results were not identical. 
(the fact that the resulting parent is equal to `Qxy` constructed by the user is convenient but less important). I don't think people would be doing that with `QuaternionAlgebra` so I think you could safely leave off the `UniqueRep` for now.

What's worse is, it still works just fine if you call it not as a decorator, but just at module-level after the class definition (note: I defined a Python function called `inherit_comparison` that implements the functionality as a class decorator):

```
sage: cython('''
....: from sage.misc.inherit_comparison import inherit_comparison
....:
....: cdef class Base(object):
....:     def __richcmp__(left, right, int op):
....:         print("Base.__richcmp__")
....:         return left is right
....:
....: cdef class Derived(Base):
....:     def __hash__(self): return 1
....:
....: inherit_comparison(Derived)
....: ''')
```

So I don't think it *needs* to be a decorator.  At the same time, as I wrote previously, I suppose the advantage of using a metaclass is that the behavior will automatically be inherited by subclasses, whereas with a decorator (whether used as above, or with the actual decorator syntax) one has to remember to use it when subclassing.

So in light of that, having the metaclass makes sense, unfortunately.

One bit of good news is that Python 3 (specifically 3.6+) has added a number of new dunder methods for customizing class creation that ease many of the most common use cases for metaclasses without explicitly using a metaclass.
