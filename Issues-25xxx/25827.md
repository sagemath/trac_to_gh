https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__round__#object.__round__

We should define these special methods so that the built-in `round` and `math.trunc`, `math.floor`, `math.ceil` can operate on Sage numbers.

This can help to eliminate imports of `floor` and `ceil` from `sage.functions` throughout the Sage library, which pulls in all of `sage.symbolic`.

Related: In the global namespace, we have:
- `round` = `sage.misc.functional.round`, 
- `floor` = `sage.functions.other.floor`, 
- `ceil` = `sage.functions.other.ceil`,
- `trunc` - undefined

I think we need to think about exactly how to implement Sage's `round()` built-in as well.  Currently, some types in Sage have a `.round()` method which takes no arguments, and only rounds to an integer--in particular it always rounds up, it seems.

I find this a bit odd, but maybe there's a good reason. I wonder, because I find it surprising that `RealNumber.round()` does *not* take into account the MPFR rounding mode of the parent field.  Why is that?  Is it just for consistency's sake--that all real and floating-point numbers round up the same way?

I implemented a `RealNumber.__round__()` which takes into account the parent field's rounding mode, and works quite nicely, though it's *incompatible* with Sage's `round()` built-in which just calls `RealNumber.round()` for integer results.  So when rounding to the nearest int you get one rounding behavior, but in other cases you get a different rounding behavior.

So two questions:

1. Is there any reason to have a `RealNumber.__round__()` that respects the parent field's rounding mode?  It seems to make sense, but maybe it contradicts other assumptions in Sage that I'm not aware of.

2. Should we add an argument to `.round()` methods and make them equivalent to `.__round__()`?  Or do we add a separate `.__round__()`, and make `.round()` just a special case equivalent to calling `__round__()` with no arguments?

FWIW here's my implementation for MPFR reals:

But I'm not 100% sure if it makes sense to do things this way or not (and it needs examples).  However, it's broken with Sage's `round()` global built-in, because that tries to call a class's `.round()` method first if it exists.  And in fact `RealNumber` does have an existing `.round()` method that's different and doesn't take into account the field's rounding mode as my above implementation does.

If anything `.round()` should be the same as `.__round__(n=0)`; that or `.round()` grows an optional extra argument.

My understanding is that `round()`, `floor()`, `ceil()`, and `trunc()` are for rounding reals to *integers*, each in the way (≈ with the rounding mode) indicated by the name of the method. The parent's rounding mode only tells you how to round the results of inexact operations in that parent, and has no role to play here. That rounding to a certain precision can also be done with a function called `round()` is an accident, the two are unrelated.

Both, I guess. What I'm trying to say (and I think it answers your question, but I haven't read the rest of the ticket, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the issue) is that:
* The `round()` *functions* (both the builtin and the one in `sage.functional`) round to a given precision. From my point of view, making them honor the parent's rounding mode when their argument already is a `RealNumber` would be an improvement.
* The `round()` *methods* of `RealNumber` and several other element classes, however, are unrelated. They are for rounding to the nearest integer; and rounding up or down or whatever else is done with other methods.

I missed that part of your question, sorry. Even when the rounding mode is “to nearest”, there are two (three?) competing conventions (up, or perhaps away from zero, in everyday life, vs to even). FWIW:
* IEEE-754 specifies both a floating-point to integer conversion that rounds to nearest with halfway cases rounding to even and one with halfway cases rounding away from zero;
* in C99/POSIX2001, `round()` rounds halfway cases *away from zero* regardless of the rounding mode.
So I'd say it is best *not* take the rounding mode into account to decide what to do with ties, and we should round *the absolute value* up. But I have no strong opinion on the matter, really. That's just my understanding of the consensus.

> And should the `round()` *function* ever call an element's `.round()` *method*?


As far as I understand, no.
