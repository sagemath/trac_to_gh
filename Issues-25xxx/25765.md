There are several SBox constructions known that exhibit some nice properties (e.g. Gold, Kasami, ... functions). Also, for 4-bit S-boxes, there are 302 affine equivalence classes - in my opinion it would be quite useful to have a representative for each in the sboxes module.

Keywords: sbox, days94
