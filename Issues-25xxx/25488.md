The current interface to the optional `kash` package has limited utility.  No way is provided to convert Kash expressions to Sage expressions, and Kash names like `sage1` might be re-used even if there are outstanding references to subexpressions like `sage1.1` (so this is also a bug fix, in addition to an enhancement).

This ticket fixes several bugs in the Kash interface, and allows a translation dictionary to be passed to a Kash object's `sage()` method, mapping Kash objects to Sage objects, allowing conversions like this:

```
    sage: kQ = kash.RationalField()
    sage: kR = kQ.PolynomialAlgebra()

    sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: ka = (x^2+x).subs({x : kR.1})
    sage541.1^2 + sage541.1
    sage: ka.sage({kR.1: x})
    x^2 + x
```

Also, keyword arguments are now passed correctly to Kash functions.

In the course of preparing this ticket, I realized that the default `bool()` routine in `interface/interface.py` is almost certainly wrong and would always need to be overridden.

Why?  Since the default implementation of `is_zero()` (in `structure/element.pyx`) returns `not self`, almost everything needs to type-convert to a boolean `True`, except for zero, which should type-convert to `False`.

`interface.py`'s default `bool()` routine has it backwards - it tests for equality to `_true_symbol()` (and everything else returns `False`), instead of inequality to `_false_symbol()` (and everything else returns `True`).

Maybe we should open another ticket for that.  For Kash, where we have separate boolean and integer types, we need to compare to both `FALSE` and `0`, so I think we need to override the method no matter what.

We are in fact thinking about removing support for `kash` completely.
The last release of `kash` was 10 years ago, and as it's only binary releases, there are increasingly fewer computers out there capable of running it.

Removing `kash` makes a lot of sense.

The problem is that it's the only thing we've got right now to compute bases for Riemann-Roch spaces over `QQ`.

Kwankyu Lee has written some new function field code that can handle Riemann-Roch calculations over finite fields, but even that code is taking forever to move into the released code base.

Somebody (maybe me) needs to expand the function field code to handle `QQ`, and get it into `master`, before we remove `kash`.

Although, I admit that next to nobody knows how to use `kash` to do those calculations.
