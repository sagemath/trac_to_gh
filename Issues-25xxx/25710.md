<div id="comment:0"></div>

In sage 8.3.beta7, plotting certain graphs results in a unicode decode error.

```
sage: A = graphs.AfricaMap()
sage: A.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
```

The same happens with `A.show()`.
