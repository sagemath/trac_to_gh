This implements a hash function for chain complexes, and it also fixes a sorting issue in the `_latex_` method. Combined with #25935, this makes tests pass for `src/sage/homology/chain_*` with Python 3.

LGTM modulo one probably extremely unlikely corner case if `deg` is in `SR`:

```
sage: SR(-1) < 0
-1 < 0
sage: sorted([1,2,3,4], reverse=(SR(-1) < 0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-600718e2dfaa> in <module>()
----> 1 sorted([Integer(1),Integer(2),Integer(3),Integer(4)], reverse=(SR(-Integer(1)) < Integer(0)))

/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.__int__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:9460)()
   1112             rif_self = sage.rings.all.RIF(self)
   1113         except TypeError:
-> 1114             raise ValueError("cannot convert %s to int" % self)
   1115         if rif_self > 0 or (rif_self.contains_zero() and self > 0):
   1116             result = floor(self)

ValueError: cannot convert -1 < 0 to int
```
The fix would be `bool(deg < 0)`:

```
sage: sorted([1,2,3,4], reverse=bool(SR(-1) < 0))
[4, 3, 2, 1]
```
