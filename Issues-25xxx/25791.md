I do not agree with deprecating `branching_rule_from_plethsym` but not `branching_rule` as the former provides functionality not accessible via the latter (at present). I would probably keep both for now. I think `BranchingRule` can be deprecated from the global namespace (its doctests all seem to use the `branching_rule` function).

In regards to [comment:2](#comment%3A2), actually, `WeylGroup` is a function, so that doesn't even work currently. However, if it was the class, it would still work with this branch:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup('A2', prefix='s')
sage: isinstance(W.an_element(), WeylGroupElement)
True
sage: type(WeylGroupElement)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
