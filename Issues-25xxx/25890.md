BinaryQF_reduced_representatives
does not work properly for positive discriminant, 
i.e., indefinite forms.
It produces repeated entries and it simply enumerates all
reduced forms of that discriminant. However, we want only representatives. 
Some examples:
Here the forms appear twice

```
sage: BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(5)
[-x^2 + x*y + y^2, -x^2 + x*y + y^2, x^2 + x*y - y^2, x^2 + x*y - y^2]
```

```

```
