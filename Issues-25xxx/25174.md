This code in this ticket corrects the conversion of tThe imaginary unit (as a symbolic expression) between sagemath and FriCAS.  In FriCAS, it's representation is "%i", not "I".  Before the ticket, we had:

```
sage: fricas(I)^2
 2
I
sage: fricas("%i")^2
- 1
```

After this ticket, also more complex stuff works:

```
sage: integrate(sin(x)*exp(I*x), x, -pi, 0, algorithm="fricas")
1/2*I*pi
```

The conversion from [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) to FriCAS is done in complete analogy to maxima.  This may not be ideal, but improving that if necessary should be done in a different ticket.

The conversion from FriCAS to [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) is a straightforward extension in the interface code.  After this ticket, complex symbolic expressions and polynomials are translated to elements of the `Symbolic Ring`.

Fricas is accessed through an interface, see `sage/interfaces/fricas.py`. Converting a Sage object to an interface object is done by implementing a `_interface_` member function for the object. Note however that `I` is not a `Constant` object but a number field element (embedded in a symbolic expression, try `type(I.pyobject())`).

+The conversion from FriCAS to [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) is a straightforward extension in the interface code.  After this ticket, complex symbolic expressions and polynomials are translated to elements of the `Symbolic Ring`.

Since `_fricas_init_` is the **exact** same as `_maxima_init_` you should rather create a unique method for both of them (and add aliases).

As I mentioned in [comment:5] the test `a**2 == -1` is not enough. You should also consider the embedding. There is an attribute `standard_embedding` so that the test could become

```
if a**2 == -1 and a.standard_embedding:
    ...
```
You should also add a doctest for the case when the embedding is the non standard one.

How do I implement the distinction `NumberFieldElement_absolute._fricas_init_(self, I)` vs. `NumberFieldElement_absolute._maxima_init_(self, I)`.  Some `super` magic?

You mean `self.standard_embedding`. right?  Doing so, I get

```
sage: K.<J> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=CC(0,-1))
sage: maxima(J)
...
TypeError: _maxima_init_() takes no arguments (1 given)
```

which is probably suboptimal.

Could you please propose one?

The super magic is called `alias`

```
class A:
    def f(self): return 3

    g = f

Indeed, it should be a `ValueError` or `NotImplementedError`.

```
sage: K.<J> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=-QQbar.gen())

I don't get it.  We have:

```
class A:
    def f(self): return superclass.f()
    def g(self): return superclass.g()
```

Is this really the same as 

```
class A:
    def f(self): return superclass.f()
    g = f
```
?

The error message is not quite accurate. The discriminant is the first reason why the conversion might fail.

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2, embedding=AA(2))
sage: maxima(sqrt2) # failing but not for a bad ebedding reason
```
Perhaps `"maxima/fricas conversions only implemented for quadratic field with discrimnant -1 and standard embedding"` (though a bit long).
