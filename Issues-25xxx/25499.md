The following is a toy example showing that a list of projective points is failing to pickle. Replace the point return with just the list of coordinates works just fine.

```
def func(Z, p):
    Xp = Z.change_ring(GF(p))
    return Xp.rational_points()

from sage.parallel.ncpus import ncpus
from sage.parallel.use_fork import p_iter_fork

P.<x,y,z,q>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
Y=P.subscheme([x^2-3^2*y^2+z*q,x+z+4*q])

normalized_input = []
for q in primes(1,10):
    normalized_input.append(((Y, q, ), {}))

p_iter = p_iter_fork(ncpus(), 10)
points_pair = list(p_iter(func, normalized_input))
```

It almost looks like it is the defining polynomials of the subscheme that is failing to pickle not the points. And if you change the example to have

```
return Xp.defining_ideal()
```

you get the same pickling error.

Btw, if the code complains about some package not being found, you can install it with `sage -pip PACKAGE`.

This bug is not specific to projective points, if we change `P` to `AffineSpace`, error is same.
