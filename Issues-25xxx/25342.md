Trying to run

```
sage -pip install "line_profiler"
```
as suggested in [the profiling tutorial](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/profiling.html#python-level-line-by-line-profiling-lprun) results in an error:

```
Collecting line_profiler
  Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/line-profiler/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version (_ssl.c:661) - skipping
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement line_profiler (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for line_profiler
```

This is with Sage 8.1:

```
$ sage --version
SageMath version 8.1, Release Date: 2017-12-07.
```

Note: fixed by our upgrade to pip 9.0.3 in #25051.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Fixed by our upgrade to pip 9.0.3 in #25051 (we have pip 18.0 since #26008).

The error reported in this ticket had to do with a configuration change at PyPI
in April 2018 which prevented to pip install packages from PyPI using macOS
and pip 9.0.1.

See the discussion at [#25051 comment:19](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25051#comment:19).

Sage 8.1 had pip 9.0.1 but Sage 8.2 had pip 9.0.3.

Setting to duplicate/invalid/wontfix.
