```
sage: from matplotlib import rcParams
sage: rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'
sage: p = plot(sin, 0, 1)
sage: rcParams['font.family']
[u'serif']
sage: p.show() # or save(), or matplotlib()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
sage: rcParams['font.family']
[u'sans-serif']
```

I think this is because `Graphics.matplotlib()` always loads a matplotlib stylesheet—usually `'classic'`—, but I'm not sure what the right thing to do would be.

Probably any of the defaults in `matplotlib/mpl-data/stylelib/classic.mplstyle` if changed through `rcParams[]` will be overwritten if `matplotlib` is called. I don't know what would have happened prior to the `matplotlib` upgrade.

I had not tested that particular scenario I must say. I thought it would work, there may be an ordering issue. One of the issue that lead to the inclusion of that style in matplotlib calls is that the default style changed between 1.5.x and 2.1.x. I got comments that plots after the upgrade to 2.1.x were not looking very good. 

Including the style restored the default of 1.5.x and restored the general quality of the plots.

In effect I have been torn between importing a style sheet before every graphics call and documenting it somewhere that you needed it for nice plots (how many graphics calls for the documentation? A few hundreds probably). Or just applying it blindly.

Anyway, I'll have to dig that code again to see what is the right thing to do to over-ride style sheet options. I added the option to change the style sheet but you want something more fine grained than that.

I'm not sure it is robust enough, particularly with how the user changes are added in. And it will increase overhead if there are a lot of user changes. Before the patch

This

```
rcParams[l[i][0]] = l[i][1]
```
is not correct in all cases, in particular the `l[i][1]`. But at the least we should restore the defaults.
