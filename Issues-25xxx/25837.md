# If you're coming from the deprecation notice in the notebook

The legacy SageNB notebook has been effectively deprecated for quite some time.
We are now making that official.
But that **does not mean that Sage will not have notebook functionality**.
In fact, most of the functionality of the sage notebook can already be replaced by using the Juypter Notebook instead.
For an introduction on how to use the new notebook and convert existing notebooks, see [the documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html).

There are *some* features that are not yet ported to the new notebook however.
**We will not completely stop supporting the legacy notebook until those issues are resolved.**
Those features are listed below. If there is some feature you're missing that is not listed or you want to give general feedback, feel free to leave a comment on this ticket. If you do not have an account yet, you can log in with a GitHub account.

# Implementation details

## Reasons to make sagenb optional

- most of its functionality has been replaced for a while by Jupyter

- it is not actively maintained -- merely on life support

- it has various open issues (looking at the "Critical" label in the github repo)
 	- unmaintained dependencies (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/440#issuecomment-381583952)
 	- incompatibility with the latest flask-babel (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/437)--
 	- incompatibility with python3 (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/343)
 	- an XSS vulnerability, unfixed for 3.5 years (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/319)

- and for me personally: I don't want to package it. I feel like it causes a disproportionate amount of issues considering its relatively low value in today's Sage.

## Reasons to keep sagenb around

- there are still some features depending on it

- there might still be people using it. An example would be @kiwifb's university: ticket:25382#comment:16

In making it optional, we still make it possible to use it for now. And when it inevitably breaks further, the people relying on it can weigh the effort of keeping it alive themselves against the effort of switching to the new notebook.

## Tickets and issues tracking progress/going in that direction

### Necessary to keep all tested behaviour intact without sagenb ("pass the doctests")

- #30540: port/remove the graph editor

- port/remove the graph database navigator

- port/remove the interactive debugger

- #25382: do not include sagenb docs in sage

### Misc changes

- #25852: add a deprecation warning to the sage notebook

- #25837: actually make sagenb optional

### Functionality sagenb currently does better than Jupyter

- #25015: object introspection (`<obj>?`) in the Jupyter notebook does not display HTML-formatted docs (esp. with latex formatting), while sagenb does

- #24784: `search_doc` does not work in the Jupyter notebook

- #9048: `automatic_names` only works in sagenb

- Jupyter's converting to PDF "[kind of sucks](#comment%3A8)" (see #23330)

- #26101: With Jupyter, `view(...)` currently displays the pdf in an external pdf viewer, launched from the server. An inline view as in sagenb is nicer and would work remotely as well.

- Jupyter does not scroll large output (e.g. matrices) well; see [this post on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54837044/jupyter-sagemath-horizontal-scroll-output?noredirect=1#comment96670361_54837044)

- probably supports matrix input, which does work in Sage cell server but not in Jupyter as of [this Sage support discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/UmTrw7ynt9U/discussion)

### Otherwise relevant

- #22431: first step in making sagenb python3 compatible
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook (which features of the Sage notebook are missing in the jupyter notebook, to be updated)
- MathJax fonts -- I don't know if it was possible to change the font in the legacy notebook either, but it's not easy to configure a different font in Jupyter notebook.  See e.g.:
  - https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2536
  - https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43082/configuring-mathjax-fonts/

Some issues I'm aware of related to features that are only in sagenb:

* #25015 - object introspection (`<obj>?`) in the Jupyter notebook does not display HTML-formatted docs (esp. with latex formatting), while sagenb does.  I believe Odile might be looking into this now.  Not a significantly difficult issue but not trivial either.

* #24784 - `search_doc` does not work in the Jupyter notebook

* #9048 - `automatic_names` only works in sagenb.  This was also discussed recently on sage-devel: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/RoBZ36i1xo4/e6ZunaKRAwAJ  I believe `automatic_names()` can be reimplemented in such a way that's mostly independent on the front-end, though one would still need front-end specific hooks for it to work.  I haven't tried this yet though.

I think at a minimum these issues should be fixed before taking further steps at abandoning the old sagenb.

Another issue that was brought up here: https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43051/file-download-as-latex/

Converting a Jupyter notebook to PDF kind of sucks at the moment for notebooks that contain a lot of math in latex.  There are two main cases in the notebook where latex can appear, and both have issues in sage:

1) If an object output from a code cell has `_render_latex_` then the notebook will display the rendered latex with mathjax.  However, when converting the notebook to PDF, nbconvert just takes the plain-text representation of the output, not the latex, and puts it in a verbatim block.  Not good, especially not for Sage.

2) If a markdown cell contains equations in latex, nbconvert *will* render them correctly, but only if you have pandoc installed.  This is already a known issue, but since pandoc does not come with Sage and is not a dependency this makes for a sucky user experience for something that should Just Work.

I'm not sure what to do about the first case; it seems like an issue for nbconvert but I haven't explored it too deeply.  For the latter case (which probably also affects the first case) I wonder if we shouldn't just make pandoc another sage dependency.

Where is the list?  I can't find it. 

I touched on this on page 26 of a talk I gave yesterday (https://share.cocalc.com/share/6cd832d3-c523-41e3-9e54-c8f2d2e8fa2a/travel/2018/2018-07-icms/talks/cocalc/slides/slides.html#1)

One example is that if you start running:

```
for i in range(10):
   print(i)
   sys.stdout.flush()
   time.sleep(1)
```
then close and open your browser (to simulate a network failure, say), you
should not loose output.   In Jupyter, you do.

It's in the description of the ticket, but perhaps that still needs more reformatting, because there are a number of thing "below" that sentence that include, but are not limited to, missing features.

Most of it falls under the heading "Functionality sagenb currently does better than Jupyter" though that list is far from complete.  There's also a link to a wiki page listing other issues.

Well, does Jupyter actually do all this stuff yet or not?

Also, for people who download a new Sage (which many do, as opposed to pulling and upgrading), it's not clear to me what happens when they try to use the notebook export functionality (which should still be the default as of now).  How do they acquire this optional package if they have a binary-only Sage?  Or would the export still accurately export to Jupyter anyway?

If SageNB doesn't work with Python 3, then we will need to drop it when we make the switch. Since the switch is coming up, we should officially deprecate this as soon as possible. If we manage to switch to Python 3 by January 1, we already won't make the required (by Sage policy) 6 months of deprecation time.

SageNB won't be ported to Python 3, it's been clear for ages I think.

I think this patch is potentially breaking the current notebook-launching setup, 
as we don't want to have a not always installed package pointed to by
`Run the old Sage Notebook` menu item.

The latter should not be shown if the package is not installed.
In this case instead a message saying something like "Install sagenb  optional package
for the old SageNB" should be there.

I added a deprecation warning close to a year ago: #25852

So I think we're good on that front if we decide to drop it with the first python3 release. Feature parity is a different issue though.
