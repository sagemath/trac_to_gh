<a id='comment:26'></a>i didn't had a close look at this yet but here are some minor things:

* there are some lines that are to long
* avoid `I` as variable name
* use `==` instead of `is` to compare strings
* top-level functions and classes should be surrounded by two blank lines 
* in the HTML documentation `class sage.crypto.linearlayer.LinearLayer` there is something wrong with the rendering of `\GF(x)^n`, the `(` are in subscript
* `naive_xor_count(self, algorithm="naive")` seems redundant to me
* docstrings should prescribe the functions effect as a command (e.g. say //Count// instead of //Counts//)

Like i said this are some minor and superficial things but depending on how strictly PEP8 and PEP257 must be followed you should have a look at these again.

I am looking forward to have a deeper look at the code and report again.

Looks like `Right_ShiftRows` and `Left_ShiftRows` must be swapped.

Something like this should work:
  {{{#!python
y = super(AESLikeLinearLayer, self).__call__(self.state_to_vector(x))
  }}}

I also had a look at `_column_linear_layer(Ls)` and i do not quite understand how it is supposed to work. Sadly the example in its docstring is useless because it is independent of the return value. I think it works if you use `state_to_vector(column_wise=True)` but default is `column_wise=False`?
