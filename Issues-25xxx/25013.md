Since they are isomorphic, we should be able to go between the two different representations:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 4, representation='matrix')
sage: Lp = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 4, representation='bracket')
sage: L.coerce_map_from(Lp)
sage: Lp.coerce_map_from(L)
sage: L(Lp.an_element())   # Boom
sage: Lp(L.an_element())   # Boom
```
