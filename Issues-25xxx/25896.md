1. The use of `_lift2smallest_field` is very dubious:

```
sage: S1 = [1,3,4,5,7,12,13]; S2 = [2,6,8,9,10,11,14]
sage: from sage.coding.code_constructions import _is_a_splitting
sage: _is_a_splitting(S1, S2, 15)
True
sage: codes.DuadicCodeEvenPair(GF(7), S1, S2)
...
ValueError: 5*z + 2 is not in the image of (map internal to coercion system -- copy before use)
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field of size 7
  To:   Finite Field in z of size 7^2
```

2. It doesn't work as documented:

```
sage: S1 = [1,3,4,5,7,12,13]; S2 = [2,6,8,9,10,11,14]
sage: from sage.coding.code_constructions import _is_a_splitting
sage: _is_a_splitting(S1, S2, 15)
True
sage: codes.DuadicCodeEvenPair(GF(3), S1, S2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    359         raise TypeError("%s, %s must be a splitting of %s."%(S1,S2,n))
    360     q = F.order()
--> 361     k = Mod(q,n).multiplicative_order()
    362     FF = GF(q**k,"z")
    363     z = FF.gen()

/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx in sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_abstract.multiplicative_order (build/cythonized/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.c:22221)()
   1766             return sage.rings.integer.Integer(self.__pari__().znorder())
   1767         except PariError:

   1769                 self, self.__modulus.sageInteger))
   1770 

ArithmeticError: multiplicative order of 3 not defined since it is not a unit modulo 15
```

3. The code assumes implicitly that the generator of a finite field is a multiplicative generator (this is easy to fix).

4. Since you explicitly refer to the docstring of `_is_a_splitting`, the latter should be public and documented.

I can imagine that 1. and 2. should be considered "bad input" but that's not clear. It seems that there is an additional hidden assumption that `q S1 = S1` (and then also `q S2 = S2`).

Updating the documentation is the absolute minimum that must be done before anything else: if we don't even know what the function *should* do, we cannot fix it.
