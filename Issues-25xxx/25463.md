OK so I positively review all the changes made in the first commit, and offer more, which almost finishes off sage.schemes.elliptic_curves. 

Remaining issues:

1. padic_lseries has 4 lines 1627-30 which look redundant but I want to ask someone else.
2. all.py: this must be a general thing to decide if we want pyflakes not to comlain about almost all all.py files!  One way round it is to simply add a line "assert x" for everything imported, but is that necessary?
3. There's a test in ell_number_field which is tagged long time with an estimate (by me probably) of 80s but it now takes 180s which is ridiculous.  I don't have time now to track down the regression, but there must be one somewhere.  I will open a ticket for that after checking that there is not yet one (I think there is a ticket about slow doctests for that file).

I think we should already do the changes here, and maybe care for the few remaining ones later in another ticket. There is no need to do anything for all.py.

I agree with your changes, and propose to set to positive once a patchbot is green.

There are failing doctests in 

sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py

These 3 failing doctests seem to be improvements over the existing ones. Should we just change them ?

I guess I will have to learn what pyflakes is. By now I assume it is a thing that picks up redundant or bad lines. Tell me if I need more. (Is there a version for cython, too? The amount of cython warnings during compilation should frighten anyone.)

> padic_lseries has 4 lines 1627-30 which look redundant but I want to ask someone else. 


```
        if p < 5:
            phi = self.frobenius(min(6,prec),algorithm="approx")
        else:
            phi = self.frobenius(prec+2,algorithm="mw")
```
Yes, they are, please delete.
phi enters the picture only at line 1737.

Yes, the crit(e)_lw is mine. Sorry about this and thanks for correcting. I agree that the doctest can be changed as proposed.

Let me know if I need to look at anything further, I am happy to help.
