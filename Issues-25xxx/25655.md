Random typos found in different parts of Sage.

- Modular decomposition of graphs: "- - the disjoint union of graphs is called a *Parallel* composition, and the complement of a disjoint union is called a *Parallel* composition."

- `is_uniform` in lattices "A congruence is uniform if all blocks *are have* equal - -"

- in "/sage/geometry/fan_morphism", there is one <code>\`phi\`</code> missing a backslash ; same in dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/endPN_automorphism_group.py
