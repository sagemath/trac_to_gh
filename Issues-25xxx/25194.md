According to the documentation, `ZZ['x'].random_element(d, a, b)` should generate a random polynomial of degree `d`, with coefficients in `[a .. b-1]`. But it seems the leading coefficient is sometimes out of this range, in Sage 8.0:

```
sage: ZZ['x'].random_element(1,0,2)
-10*x
sage: ZZ['x'].random_element(0,0,2)
217
```

I believe I've found the error.

In this file https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py#L1242,

```python
1242         p = self([R.random_element(*args,**kwds) for _ in range(degree[1]+1)])
1243
1244         if p.degree() < degree[0]:
1245             p += R._random_nonzero_element() * self.gen()**randint(degree[0],degree[1])
1246
1247         return p
```

line 1242 creates a valid polynomial with random coefficients. However, there's a possibility that the leading coefficients will be 0, so we'll get a polynomial with degree less than the values passed in. The if statement then adds on the leading term, and sets the coefficient to R._random_nonzero_element(). 

Unfortunately, whoever wrote this forgot that the coefficients must be in between a and b, therefore there's a chance of getting an incorrect leading coefficient. Changing this to 

```python
1242         p = self([R.random_element(*args,**kwds) for _ in range(degree[1]+1)])
1243
1244         if p.degree() < degree[0]:
1245             p += R._random_nonzero_element(*args, **kwds) * self.gen()**randint(degree[0],degree[1])
1246
1247         return p
```

seems to fix it.

great, thank you for the analysis! But I fear the 2nd call to `R._random_nonzero_element` can also give a zero coefficient, thus maybe a while loop is needed, ensuring first that a non-zero element exists in the given coefficient range.

R._random_nonzero_element is already written as a while loop

```
while True:
    x = self.random_element(*args, **kwds)
    if not x.is_zero():
        return x
```

You bring up a good point though, if we pass in a = 0 and b = 1, then there are no non-zero elements in the ring and we end up in an infinite loop... I've fixed this by returning 0 if args is (0, 1).

```
1337         # If the bounds are 0 and 1, the only choice for coefficients is 0
1338         if args == (0, 1):
1339             return 0
1340
1341         p = self([R.random_element(*args, **kwds) for _ in range(degree[1] + 1)])
1342
1343         if p.degree() < degree[0]:
1344             p += R._random_nonzero_element(*args, **kwds) * self.gen() ** randint(de     gree[0], degree[1])
1345
1346         return p
```

While we're at this topic, it seems to me that line 1341 is not quite correct - we want a random polynomial with degree between degree[0] and degree[1], so we should generate the degree randomly too. The current code generates degree[1] + 1 coefficients, so there is a higher chance of generating a polynomial with large degree. Even worse, if the coefficient bounds do not include 0, we **always** get a polynomial of degree degree[1]

```
sage: l = []
sage: for _ in range(1000):
....:     l.append( ZZ[x].random_element((1, 100), 1, 4) )
....:
sage: min( p.degree() for p in l )
100
```

However, this might be the intended behavior... should this be fixed?

sorry I missed the fact that `R._random_nonzero_element` could not give 0.

Yes the current behaviour does not seem to match the documentation in case the degree range contains several values. I suggest one first draws a random degree d uniformly in [degree[0],degree[1]], then a random polynomial of degree d.

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
there is something strange with this patch: `ZZ['x'].random_element(1,0,2)` seems to only generate the polynomial `x`, whereas it should also generate `x+1` with the same proabability.

Sage 8.0:

```
sage: add(1 for i in range(1000) if ZZ['x'].random_element(1,0,2)[0]==1)
510
```

With this patch:

```
sage: add(1 for i in range(1000) if ZZ['x'].random_element(1,0,2)[0]==1)
0
```

Looks good to me. Paul, you can set to positive_review if it looks good to you.

sorry to be nit-picking:

```

should be I believe:

For the first file, the failing test is

2993             sage: K.<x> = QQ[]

I don't see how this test could always pass because the code generates a random element in the polynomial field. My guess is that the RNG is seeded with some constant value, if this is true, do I just update the doctest to change this polynomial?

For the next 2 files, I actually got that the tests passed.

So doing this made the doctest not fail

Without the `# random`, I get

Would it be better to change line 2995 so to use this new polynomial `-x^4 - 12*x^3 + 1/2*x^2 - 1/95*x - 1/2`? Or is it preferred to use `# random`? This is my first time changing doctests so I am not really sure here.

> Would it be better to change line 2995 so to use this new polynomial `-x^4 - 12*x^3 + 1/2*x^2 - 1/95*x - 1/2`? Or is it preferred to use `# random`? This is my first time changing doctests so I am not really sure here.

If there was no `# random` marker before, it is probably better to change the expected output.

I've updated some of the doctests, I do not have the time to fix them all right now but I will get around to them all eventually.

These timeouts probably don't have anything to do with this ticket, there have been issues of that kind with new p-adic code or tests lately (see the discussions on sage-devel). The same thing may apply to the failures Paul is seeing, I don't know for sure.

The values before were 78 and 117, then I implemented a `_random_nonzero_element()` for MatrixSpace and I incremented those numbers to 79 and 118 in this commit https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/b4594c3cfb01f514397a833e878b0c7feb520b9f. I am not sure why they increased again.

Thanks for the review.

Only problem is that there was a merge conflict https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/25194/Gentoo%20Base%20System/2.2/x86_64/4.4.26-gentoo/sage4/2018-07-02%2001:54:32?short

Is there anyway I can see exactly what went wrong?
