As far as I can tell there is no code using the ability to hash `Morphisms`, and having this in the base class is misleading since there are subclasses which are not immutable and should not be hashable anyways.  It would be better to implement `__hash__` on an as-needed basis for those classes that can guarantee immutability.

### Original description
`ContinuousMap` is impacted by #24551 in that it defines an `__eq__`, so its default hash is not inherited from its base class, `Morphism` (which does define `__hash__`).

This is one of the classes impacted by the issue raised [in this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25387#comment:3).

I'm not sure what the best solution is.  Right now I feel like it's somewhat ill-defined, because it's possible to have two `ContinuousMaps` that compare as equal, but have different hashes.  That's not necessarily wrong, but it isn't obviously right either.  If `x == y`, then `hash(x) == hash(y)` for a correct implementation.  Technically I believe you can get away with the inverse--having `hash(x) == hash(y)` but `x != y`--but it is advisable for performance to avoid this.

That is true iff a perfect hash function exists, which it generally does not. In fact, that is *not* mandated by Python. For example, a valid hash function is 0 for all objects, but you loose performance benefits from `dict` because it becomes a list search.

The converse is really what you want: `==` implies same hash. (Also to be hashable, the hash should be immutable.) You can get away with it, but it causes problems when you try to put it into a set/dictionary as you get multiple instances of equal objects.

The issue with this class is that we have essentially a mutable element class. So I think the proper thing to do is just disable hashing. We do something similar for vectors and matrices.

 `ContinuousMap` is impacted by #24551 in that it defines an `__eq__`, so its default hash is not inherited from its base class, `Morphism` (which does define `__hash__`).

Sorry for showing up late in the discussion, but for some reason, I did not received the Trac notification that I've been put in the Cc list of this ticket; I actually discovered the existence of the ticket only today, while reading the "python3 status" post on sage-devel...

Let me summarize a few things about `ContinuousMap`:

- `ContinousMap` objects are "in spirit" immutable: they represent continuous maps between topological manifolds and once such a map is defined, there is no meaning in modifying it. However, in practice, such maps cannot be fully defined at their creation by the user, because some new charts may be introduced on the fly on the manifold and a given map should be able to have coordinate expressions in terms of these charts, hence the methods `add_expr` and `set_expr`. 

- `ContinousMap` (more precisely the derived class `DiffMap`) needs to be hashable because `DiffMap` objects serve as keys in the dictionary of vector field modules on a manifold (see [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.html) for details).

- I understand that the `__hash__` method inherited from `Morphism` relies on the `repr` of the continuous map and in some cases (maps `f` and `g` having the same domain, codomain, but different names given by the user), one may have `f == g` with `hash(f) != hash(g)`, which is very bad!

I propose to implement a `__hash__` method in `ContinuousMap` that ensures that maps that compare equal have the same hash. It would make sense that I do this atop commit 1a9907 (i.e. the commit in the branch currently attached to this ticket), since the latter is suppressing `Morphism.__hash__`. Do you agree?

Actually the type of immutatibility involved for `ContinuousMap` is that defined by Simon King in this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/d8-r3uEewFU/Jb02875ACgAJ): methods, like `add_expr`, may change (enhance) the internal representation of the object, but in any case they must preserve the equivalence class with respect to `==` to which the object belongs at its creation.

Indeed, for `ContinousMap`, which don't have any "generator", the issue is the default back to the hash of `repr()`.

OK I will do it. 

>Please also make sure there is a test demonstrating not only that the hash works, but *why* it should work, since my experiment in removing it didn't appear to break any test after all...

I am quite surprised about this: how could `ContinuousMap` objects be used as dictionary keys without any `__hash__` method?

I did the experiment, i.e. remove `Morphism.__hash__`, and discovered that the hash of `ContinousMap` is then inherited from `Map.__hash__`, which does (cf. line 1292 o f `src/sage/categories/map.pyx`):

```
return hash((self.domain(), self._codomain))
```
This simple hash seems very satisfactory to me, except maybe for `self._codomain` that may be replaced by `self.codomain()`. Actually this is what I had in mind when proposing to implement `ContinousMap.__hash__`. So if you remove `Morphism.__hash__`, there is no need to write a proper `ContinousMap.__hash__`: that of `Map` is sufficient.

Yes. Anyway, if I understand correctly, for Python3, one needs to implement `ContinuousMap.__hash__` because there is a `ContinuousMap.__eq__`, so that `__hash__` cannot be inherited. Correct?

Btw, other manifolds classes that have to be hashable because they serve as dictionary keys are `TopologicalManifold`, `Chart` and `VectorFrame`. However, they all inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`, from which they get `__hash__` and `__eq__`. So it should be OK for Python3 with them, shouldn't it?

Actually I was wrong: there is no danger since in Python3, a class that defines some `__eq__` does no longer inherit `__hash__` from any base class. From [this part of Python 3 reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__): *If a class that overrides `__eq__()` needs to retain the implementation of `__hash__()` from a parent class, the interpreter must be told this explicitly by setting `__hash__ = <ParentClass>.__hash__`.* In our case, this means that if one does not write explicitly 

```
   __hash__ = Map.__hash__
```
(and of course does not reimplement `__hash__`), then the subclass is not hashable.

Probably things will be more clear if `Map.__hash__` is removed.
