Our current function field code has recently been revised and improved, and released in Sage 8.7.

This ticket adds support to the new code for using the optional `kash` package as an `implementation` option.

The major advantage of Kash is that it supports characteristic zero (i.e, function fields over `QQ` and number fields), while our current native code only works over finite fields.  This implementation also supports `QQbar`, even though Kash doesn't support it natively.

Kash should also be useful for double-checking our results as the native implemention moves forward.

Using this code requires the `kash3` package to be installed, i.e, run

```
sage -p kash3
```
