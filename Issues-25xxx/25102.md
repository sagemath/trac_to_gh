this just allows a few additional digits in some outputs that apparently show up on Debian.

I know about "rel tol" but I am just following the pattern that is already used in many other places in these files.
    
These changes are used on the Debian builds to make these doctests pass. They are part of Debian's `u2-fix-trivial-test-cases.patch`.

Unfortunately I don't know for sure where the extra digits come from, it may be due to different versions of numpy or something between Debian and what Sage expects.

If "rel tol" works for tuples that might be a better solution; I wrote these patches quickly to get stuff working and am not super familiar with the features of the testing framework.

For future reference: the `rel tol` stuff really works on the level of strings, analogous to the `...`. It doesn't understand the structure of the output, it just allows replacing floating-point numbers textually by different floating-point numbers. So yes, it works with tuples but also with anything else.
