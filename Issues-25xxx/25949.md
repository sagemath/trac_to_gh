The following code produces a rather strange error in Sage 8.1:

```
var('t1e t1n')
solve([t1n == t1e + 2], t1n)
```

The error given is:

```

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 2159, in symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
    raise TypeError("unable to make sense of Maxima expression '%s' in Sage"%s)
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '[_SAGE_VAR_t1n==_SAGE_VAR_t100.000000000000]' in Sage
```

It seems that the Maxima output parser is seeing the sequence '1e+2' and converting it to a decimal, even though that's not syntactically correct. I found the offending code in the master branch on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub): [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/calculus/calculus.py#L2125-L2130](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/calculus/calculus.py#L2125-L2130). I haven't gotten a chance to try fixing anything yet, but I wonder if removing that code would have any negative impact (since it seems like the parser already implements scientific notation in a syntactically-aware way).
