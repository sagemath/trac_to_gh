The algorithm is not the fastest possible, but as usual, I think it's easier to make better when we have at least a point to compare with.

Do you mean `is_uniform` or `is_constuctible_by_doublings`?

> And if you have some time, would you please try #24994 ?


I can try, but never before looked at IPython code.
