Now it should work.

The algorithm is not the fastest possible, but as usual, I think it's easier to make better when we have at least a point to compare with.

Do you mean `is_uniform` or `is_constuctible_by_doublings`?

I can try, but never before looked at IPython code.

`is_constructible_by_doublings`, also called `bounded` in some references

Please just simply try the ticket and report if it works.. I suspect that the ipython widgets are broken right now.

What's wrong with our current `is_constructible_by_doublings('interval')`?
