<a id='comment:10'></a>So the only change I am not sure about is this one:

```diff
-        zero = self._parent.base_ring().zero()
-        l = self.list()
-        return [i for i in range(len(l)) if l[i] != zero]
+        return [i for i, c in enumerate(self) if c]
```
since `self.list()` returns a list, which we can `cdef list l` and then `cdef int i` to get C-level list lookups instead of going through a Python iterator. Also, we can pass the `copy=False` option. I know there are polynomial implementations where calling `list` always makes a (Sage version) copy of the data. Probably the way to choose for this is look at timings and the generated C code.
