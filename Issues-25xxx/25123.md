I would like to know, is it a good idea to add random sampling method for calculating closeness centrality, which will give error percentage < 5% on avg.

Reference:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0035.pdf

Currently, in sage, the closeness centrality is calculated by using
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01490

This ticket have dependence with #25223 ticket.

Thanks, \\
As cython will give better performance than python. I will code it in cython. \\
Could you please say is Dijkstra algorithm in sage, is available in cython?. \\
If a graph is unweighted, shall I replace Dijkstra's algorithm with BFS for calculating closeness centrality. This will give an advantage in terms of running time.

There is a Dijkstra implementation in the `SparseGraphBackend`. There is another one when you use the boost backend, plus the boost backend implements closeness centrality.

Solved the problem, I forgot to reset the master. \\
The current implementation uses BFS if a graph is unweighted and Dijkstra if a graph is weighted.

Algorithm: \\

1. Choose k random vertices from n vertices of input graph G.
2. Run k times BFS or Dijkstra and estimate closeness centrality for n-k vertices.

Instead of using 2D array and store `k*n` distances, I used a 1D array(sum_array), sum_array[v] will give the sum of the distances from v to k random vertices. From this optimization, less memory will be used.

Please let me know what more I can do to improve the code performance.

Please do never hesitate to remind definitions, and more importantly to explain what your algorithm is doing. I had to look for definitions to guess what you are doing.

Before `improve the code performance`, the most important, and first step, is to have a clear and robust code. 

- Please check for typos: `verices`, 
- Your method is for undirected graphs only, right ?
- the notion of `farness`, used in other closeness centrality methods, is the sum of distances, `sum_array` in your code
- The method must start checking parameters before doing anything else
- You should reorganize your code to separate weighted and unweighted cases. There is no need to call `init_short_digraph` if the graph is weighted.
- `cdef long long int *distance` why `long long int` ? The largest distance is the diameter of the graph, and so in unweighted graphs it is at most `n-1`. So `int` or `uint32_t` is more than enough, no ?
- don't call a variable `sum`. It might conflict with builtin methods.
- `for i in range(0,k)` -> `for i in range(k)`
- In `distances = shortest_paths(G,randomk[i], algorithm=None)`, which `shortest_paths` method are you calling ? 
- according your code for weighted case, the `k` randomly chosen vertices have different centralities since the `sum` increases. Is that right ?

I will consider the unweighted case later. I'm not confortable with coding again a BFS for short digraph. I think we should do something more clever, like moving method `simple_BFS` from `distances_all_pairs.pyx` to the `static_sparse_graph` backend, and then use it.

Apologies, for not adding the proper explanation to the algorithm.
I will try to add all the required definitions whenever required.

It's applicable to directed graph if it's connected.

Farness says how far `u` is from `v`. \\
sum_array says it's the sum of distances from `v` to `k random vertices`.\\
Please correct me if I am wrong, shall I replace `sum_array` will `sum_of_farness`. \\

Sure I will update it.

Yes, I will update it. I kept in mind that I will implement for weighted graph so I have taken long long int.

> - don't call a variable `sum`. It might conflict with builtin methods.
 
Sure shall I replace it with `sum_of_all_distances`? 

> - `for i in range(0,k)` -> `for i in range(k)`

It should be Dijstra, I will update the defination that weighted graph should have only positive weights.
 
> - according your code for weighted case, the `k` randomly chosen vertices have different centralities since the `sum` increases. Is that right ?
 
Yes, those `k` will be having exact closeness centrality value. as all the remaining vertices will be contributing in calculating closeness value for them. \\
   
Other `n-k` vertices will be estimated and only k vertices are contributing there distances in the estimation of `n-k` vertices.

That is a really good suggestion. So shall I create a new ticket `cleaning of the usage of BFS` or do I need to do it in this ticket? 
If I create a new ticket then do I need to wait for `cleaning of the usage of BFS` to be accepted. 

Thank you, for taking your valuable time out for reviewing my code and giving feedback.

OK, but again I had to check carefully the definition. The closeness centrality of v is computed using distances from each other node to v. So it works because you select k source nodes and compute shortest path distances from these nodes. So for a node v, you know the distance from a source node to v. It remains to sum over the sources.

> > - the notion of `farness`, used in other closeness centrality methods, is the sum of distances, `sum_array` in your code
 
> Farness says how far `u` is from `v`. \\

NO, it's not the distance from u to v, it's the sum of the distances from every nodes in the graph to u.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality where it is written: Closeness was defined by Bavelas (1950) as the reciprocal of the farness.

> sum_array says it's the sum of distances from `v` to `k random vertices`.\\
> Please correct me if I am wrong, shall I replace `sum_array` will `sum_of_farness`. \\


In this algorithm, instead of the farness, you use a kind of partial farness, that is the sum of the distances between each of the k source nodes of shortest path trees to v.

but for weighted graphs you use `double`, which make sense since weights can be int or float.

for instance, yes.

However, keep in mind that this sum of all distances is the sum of the farness of the vertices.
So instead of adding each distances, it should be faster to compute the sum of the farness.

This is true in undirected graphs only. In directed graph, you need distances to these k nodes to get exact closeness centrality.

OK

In general it's better to have targeted tickets. So yes we need a new ticket, and yes, you will have to add a dependency between this ticket and the new one, plus rebase on it.

It's more time and more work, but we should get in the end a better solution for this ticket.

The sum is farness, `not sum of farness`. \\
`sum`: it's the sum of the distances from every nodes in the graph to u(belong to k). \\
`sum of array`: it's the sum of the distances from k nodes in the graph to u(doesn't belong to k). \\

Sure I will generate a new ticket for `cleaning of the usage of BFS`

To be double sure, the main motive of the new ticket is to shift `BFS` from `distances_all_pairs.pyx` to the `static_sparse_backend.pyx` and update the reference where ever required.

simple_BFS() will return a single value i.e the highest distance value found in graph G from source but I need complete distance array.

Could you suggest what shall I do?
1. Change the definition of simple_BFS i.e pass extra parameter i.e flag, if the flag value is 'eccentricity' return single value if the flag is 'distance_array' return distance array.

2. Use own bfs function, a small advantage, it will take O(n) timeless, when comparing to step 1.

There is a mistake in your code with the labels of vertices in `Graph` and in `short_digraph`.

In `Graph`, the label of a vertex can be an integer, a tuple, a string, or any hashable data structure. In `short_digraph`, vertices are integers from 0 to `n-1`. If you check in methods using short digraph, you can see the use of a list `vertex_to_int` and a dictionary `int_to_vertex` used to use the right label. An important assumption in the graph module is that the list on vertices is always ordered the same way. So usually you can do `int_to_vertex = G.vertices()` and later `int_to_vertex[i]` to access the right vertex label. And `vertex_to_int = {u:i for i,u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}` can be used when you need the inverse function (not sure you need it here).

You must correct you code to take that into account.

You have not adequately corrected the code. Have you tested it ?

I give you a set of corrections to be done.


- If the graph is directed, you must raise an error.

```
-    if G.is_directed():
-        return "G should be undirected Graph."
+    if G.is_directed():
+        raise ValueError("G should be undirected Graph.")
```
- `cdef int i,j,u,qstart, qend, v` -> `cdef int i, j, u, qstart, qend, v`
- `cdef uint32_t *p_tmp` not used, so remove
- `cdef bint weighted = G.weighted()` not needed. You use this value only once

- Check of input parameters must be performed before any malloc and raise an error !

```
-    if k > n:
-        return "k value need to be less than number of nodes"
+    if k > n:
+        raise ValueError("k value need to be less than number of nodes")
```
- `cdef list int_to_vertex = G.vertices()` must be put before the `if weighted` test. It will be used in the weighted case too
- `if weighted:` -> `if G.weighted():`
- `from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import shortest_paths` you should use `cimport`, no ?

Weighted part:
- `distances = shortest_paths(G,randomk[i], algorithm='Dijstra')` the value `randomk[i]` is an integer in range `0..n-1`. This is not a valid vertex label. You must use `int_to_vertex[randomk[i]]`.
- `partial_farness[vertex] = float(distances[vertex])`. Here, `vertex` is the label of a vertex of the graph and `partial_farness` is an array of order `n`. So you need to use a mapping `vertex_to_int`.


Unweighted part:
- `bitset_init` must be done before the for loop. Then, inside the loop you can do a `bitset_clear`.
- `NULL,waiting_list,seen)` -> `NULL, waiting_list, seen)`

1. Added ValueError() instead of return message
2. Removed all the unused variables
3. Added test cases
4. Fixed the gap in weighted part.
Can't add cimport as `boost_graph.pxd` doesn't have defination of shortest_paths(), shall I go ahead and add necessary lines in `boost_graph.pxd` for cimport instead of import. \\

Tested on both weighted and unweighted.

weighted graph G = `Graph([['0', '1',1],['0', '7',1],['0', '3',1],['0', '11',1],['2', '3',1],['1', '2',1],['1', '12',1],['2', '12',1],['3', '4',1],['3', '6',1],['4', '5',1],['4', '7',1],['4', '6',1],['5', '6',1],['7', '10',1],['7', '8',1],['7', '11',1],['8', '9',1],['8', '10',1],['8', '11',1],['9', '11',1]], weighted = True)`

weighted graph `G = Graph([['0', '1'],['0', '7'],['0', '3'],['0', '11'],['2', '3'],['1', '2'],['1', '12'],['2', '12'],['3', '4'],['3', '6'],['4', '5'],['4', '7'],['4', '6'],['5', '6'],['7', '10'],['7', '8'],['7', '11'],['8', '9'],['8', '10'],['8', '11'],['9', '11']])`

Please let me know if any more modifications needed.

Good. I have few more comments.

> Can't add cimport as `boost_graph.pxd` doesn't have defination of shortest_paths(), shall I go ahead and add necessary lines in `boost_graph.pxd` for cimport instead of import. \\


Well, I don't know if it is really interesting to cimport it.

You may however do something like that to clarify in your code that this method uses boost:

```
from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import shortest_paths as boost_shortest_paths
```


You must add
- a one line description of the method at it's beginning (see other methods for examples).

- a line like `:func:`centrality_closeness_random_k` | copy-paste-of-the-one-line-description` at the top of the file. It's a table to show what the module contains

Then,
- as for ticket #25002, references must be placed in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`. You could also actualize the ref https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2660465

- You have put a TESTS section. You could also add an EXAMPLES section.

- ```G`` a undirected Graph` -> ```G`` -- a undirected Graph` and same modification for other input

- OUTPUT block: the description is not exactly what you return. By the way, you could return a dictionary indexed by vertices.

- `l = []`. You could directly do `l = list(range(n)`. 

- Instead of using `seen_random_vertices[i]`, may be you could only use the shuffled list `l` where the `k` first elements are those in `randomk` and elements `k..n-1` are those for which `seen_random_vertices[i]==0`. Think about it and see if you can simplify the code using this idea.

- I realize that `simple_BFS` calls `bitset_clear`. So you don't need to do it in `centrality_closeness_random_k`

- you will have to add a `bitset_free(seen)` somewhere ;)

One idea is to take a small distance regular graph like a cycle with 5 nodes or a PetersenGraph. Then, you can extract from the solution the list of values, and sort it. It should always be the same, no? \\


What if `G.order() == 0` or `G.order() == 1` ?
What if `G.size() == 0` ?
In both cases you can directly return the solution.

Also, the test `if k > n:` should at the very beginning, before any malloc.\\ \\



> > - I realize that `simple_BFS` calls `bitset_clear`. So you don't need to do it in `centrality_closeness_random_k`

Made necessary changes.
1. Updated the reference list i.e index.rst and removed the reference block from the code.
2. Added one example, if `k = n` we will get the same result every time as it's exact not estimated.
3. Added one test case.

It's saying auto merge is failed, is it related to my recent commit or it will be taken care.

Let me know your feedback.

I committed the code on Sage 8.1beta0 and sage was updated to 8.3beta0 because of which automerge failed.

I followed the below doc to update the master. \\
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html

But couldn't resolve the problem.

Please let me know what I should do to solve the problem.

for some reason [BCM15] was in src/sage/graphs/centrality.pyx as well as in the index.rst

So I removed it from the former and pushed the result in a public branch.

I started by checking out the latest develop branch from trac, and then pulling the ticket's branch. This failed (as expected) with conflicts marked in centrality.pyx; and that conflict was exactly the spurrous reference to [BCM15], which I removed.

There is no unique way to solve such issues. For starters, you need to understand the difference between merging and rebasing, see e.g. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing

> 2. What is the right way to update the master and rebase it to the current branch?


what I did: 

 1) make a fresh clone/branch of the master (more precisely, the `develop` branch on the git trac server). Say, if you already have a cloned repo, and assuming 
 `trac` is the name of the git trac remote, as shown by `git remote -v`, this would be `git checkout -b my_new_version trac/develop` followed by `git pull trac develop`.

 2) merge your changes; say, if they are already on the git trac in a branch foo, this could done by `git pull trac foo`. If it's merged automatically, done. Else, you need to resolve conflicts and commit the changes you've done. I simply use the command line, although there are various merging tools (they are needed in hard cases with a lot of changes, hopefully not what you have to deal with). This means, edit the files with conflicts marked by `>>>>`, `<<<<`, and `=====` markers, and commit the changes. Finally, don't forget to push your new branch to trac. 

 3) alternatively, instead of 1) and 2), you could have done `git pull trac develop` on your branch and resolved conflicts there, just as in 2).

Rebasing is less intuitive. I recommend doing `git pull trac develop` on the branch you are working as often as needed (approximately after each new beta/release candidate), but before doing this do a push to git trac server as a backup.
This way hopefully rebasing won't be needed.

Needless to say, make sure your branches are backed up often, say by pushing to a git server (trac or not).

I did some minor corrections in this ticket. Please check if it is OK for you.

I have a question for graphs without edges. In method `centrality_closeness`, it is written that the closeness centrality of a vertex without (out)neighbors is not defined. So the method returns an empty dictionary. Here, we raise an error. I don't know which behavior is best. What do you think ?

To be consistent with the `centrality_closeness` method, we can just consider that this value is not defined for isolated vertices. Check the way I propose to do that, avoiding as much as possible to select isolated vertices.

I have forgotten about the isolated case, thanks for pointing it out.
For it `n` value need to be reduced as isolated vertices are not contributing anything in estimating the closeness centrality for other vertices. \\
1. Remove all the isolated vertices from `G`.
2. Find Closeness centrality on `G'`.
3. Add all isolated vertices to `G'`.
Closeness centrality for isolated vertices is zero.

Please have a look and let me know your feedback.

It is very bad to modify the input graph. It is a typical source of errors, so you should not do it.

A typical bug is when the graph is immutable:

```
sage: H = Graph([[0,1,2], [(0,1)]], immutable=True)
sage: centrality_closeness_random_k(H, 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Thou shalt not remove a vertex from an immutable graph
```



Also, I don't understand why the returned values are not the same in this example.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.centrality import centrality_closeness_random_k
sage: G = Graph([(0,1), (2,3)])
sage: centrality_closeness_random_k(G, 4)
{0: 1.5, 1: 3.536366632952126e-08, 2: 1.5, 3: 1.5}
sage: G.add_vertex(4)
sage: centrality_closeness_random_k(G, 4)
{0: 3.465914218230295e-08, 1: 3.465914218230295e-08, 2: 1.5, 3: 1.5, 4: 0.0}
```

Finally, as I already said, the behavior must be unified with the `centrality_closeness` method.

It's because the estimation is defined on connected Graph not on disconnected graph.
Shall I use `connected_components_subgraphs()` function and estimate on connected component? but shall I take `k` value for each connected component? for some connected component `k<n` and for other `k>n`. \\
One option could be `k=n` if `k>n` or we can update input should be connected. \\
Which one could be better?

> Finally, as I already said, the behavior must be unified with the `centrality_closeness` method.

Yes, the method should be.

I don't see any suitable way to handle properly connected components and isolated vertices.
Also I propose a radical solution: make this method work only for connected graphs, and raise an error if the graph is not connected.
Otherwise we will continue to discuss for ever without reaching a satisfactory solution.

So do the required modifications and mention it in the documentation of the method.

As is_connected case is added. They won't be any Isolated vertices case. \\
As `closeness_centrality_top_k` make `k = n` if `k > n`, I updated same in random_k.
