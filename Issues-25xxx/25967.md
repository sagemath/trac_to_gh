A lattice can be built from lower pseudo-intervals iff `|Ji(L)| = |Ji (Con L)|`. But we can not have `|Ji(L)| < |Ji (Con L)|`. Hence we can stop when we found two principal congruences to be the same.

As an extreme example if `L = posets.DiamondPoset(100)` then `L.is_constructible_by_doublings('lower')` took 460 ms before the patch and now it takes 20 ms. To check for all 10-element finite lattices the time drops from 19,9 to 7,2 seconds.

Rather than using `SetPartition`, it would be better to use lower-level Python objects:

```diff
-S = SetPartition(H.congruence([[v, next(H.neighbor_out_iterator(v))]]))
+S = frozenset(map(frozenset, H.congruence([[v, next(H.neighbor_out_iterator(v))]])))
```
to avoid the overhead, including constructing the parent, all of this is in Python, and the checks of `SetPartition`.

Otherwise LGTM
