As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/a_2RU4hTdM8/NApTFCiMBgAJ

The example I found (and there might be others) was:

```
sage: e1 = sqrt(2)*I - sqrt(2) - 2 
sage: e2 = sqrt(2)
sage: e1 * e2
```

According to rws the following fix to pynac, not yet in Sage, fixes the issue: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/c4b2a4a42c6f01f0db6c3d54d49cccc3a049806e

The commit is contained in pynac-0.7.17 (introduced with #24838).

Depends on #24838
