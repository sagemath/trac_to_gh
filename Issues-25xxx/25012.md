That is not what is happening. This code is specifically meant to deal with such race conditions. But somehow it is still breaking anyway. Which filesystem are you using?

It is well known that NFS tends to break things which work perfectly for local filesystems. I have no idea what "Lustre" is.

Still, it would be interesting to know *why* it fails on NFS. Can you check with the following diff:
