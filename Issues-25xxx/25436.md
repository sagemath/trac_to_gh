In some files like `asteroidal_triples.pyx`, `comparability.pyx`, `static_sparse_graph.pyx`, etc., the first line of the file is 

```
# cython: binding=True
```
I don't know what is means, but may be it's the solution ?

  

> * The function `strongly_connected_components` uses the implementation in `sage\graphs\base\static_sparse_graph`. Do I create an interface for this function also in `connectivity.pyx`? As of now, this function is used as an alias in `digraph.py`.


I think there is no need for it yet. If needed later, then we can add it.

It is related, but you don't need to move it since it is deprecated => in 1 year we will remove it. Indeed, we have the boost method `dominator_tree` which is a bit faster, so we are now using is for `strong_articulation_points`?

Okay, the boost method `dominator_tree` is used as an alias in `generic_graph.py` also. But in the `strong_articulation_points` method of `digraph.py`, the function `immediate_dominators` is used.

<a id='comment:13'></a>It was a mistake I did. I could not rebase the previous version. Hence, I took a backup of the edited files and started re-doing it on the 8.3beta2 version. And I did the mistake of changing the entire generic_graph.py. Hence, I worked on it again now. Hopefully, there must be no errors now since I have not changed any other methods apart from the ones moved to `connectivity.pyx`, and when I ran the command `./sage -t src/sage/graphs/`, all tests passed.

Is there some other place to check for failed tests?

Yes, this does make it more clear. I have made the change now and split it into tables.

In general, `./sage -tp --long src/sage/` is enough.

For the patchbot, you have to set your patch to `needs review` I think.

For some reasons, I cannot check the html documentation. Have you built it and checked that it displays well ?

Since the methods are now in the connectivity.pyx file and not defined along with the `GenericGraph` class, I changed the doctests to 

```
from sage.graphs.connectivity import is_connected
is_connected(G)
```

`G.is_connected()` also works and gives the same output as `is_connected(G)` since `GenericGraph` class redirects to the method in `connectivity.pyx`. All the doctests passed with `is_connected(G)`. Should I add in the documentation that `G.is_connected()` will also work?
