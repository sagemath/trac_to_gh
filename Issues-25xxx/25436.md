I created a new file `connectivity.pyx`. I started moving all the connectivity related functions from `generic_graph.py` and `digraph.py` to the new file. As of now, the functions in `generic_graph.py` and `digraph.py` haven't been removed, I made a function call to `connectivity.pyx`, because I was not able to get the alias working.

I have the following issues:
* As in `generic_graph.py` and `digraph.py` classes, an alias to a function in a different module can be done using `from sage.graphs.connectivity import is_connected as is_connected`. I tried doing this, it partially worked. The function `is_connected` showed up correctly in the html docs. But the code gave me an error saying `is_connected function expects exactly one argument`. This should technically not happen and it should accept `self.is_connected()` the way it works with other aliases. Maybe I am missing something. I am working on it, but please let me know if you have any idea.

* The function `strongly_connected_components` uses the implementation in `sage\graphs\base\static_sparse_graph`. Do I create an interface for this function also in `connectivity.pyx`? As of now, this function is used as an alias in `digraph.py`.

* I was not sure if the function [`immediate_dominators()`](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/digraph.html#sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph.immediate_dominators) in `digraph.py` is related to connectivity or just dominator vertices? Should I move it to `connectivity.py`?

In some files like `asteroidal_triples.pyx`, `comparability.pyx`, `static_sparse_graph.pyx`, etc., the first line of the file is 

```
# cython: binding=True
```
I don't know what is means, but may be it's the solution ?

  

> * The function `strongly_connected_components` uses the implementation in `sage\graphs\base\static_sparse_graph`. Do I create an interface for this function also in `connectivity.pyx`? As of now, this function is used as an alias in `digraph.py`.


I think there is no need for it yet. If needed later, then we can add it.

It is related, but you don't need to move it since it is deprecated => in 1 year we will remove it. Indeed, we have the boost method `dominator_tree` which is a bit faster, so we are now using is for `strong_articulation_points`?

Okay, the boost method `dominator_tree` is used as an alias in `generic_graph.py` also. But in the `strong_articulation_points` method of `digraph.py`, the function `immediate_dominators` is used.

Yes, we are using `dominator_tree` for `strong_articulation_points` also. I was in the 8.2 version previously and got it wrong. I changed to 8.3beta2 now and it is fine.

Not easy to say. Many modules use graphs, like `combinat`, `categories`, etc. So somehow we have to pass test on the full library. The patchbot should be helpful in this.

Another issue: your patch #25352 does not appear here (method `blocks_and_cut_vertices` with Boost).
Since the ticket is now closed, it shall be added to next beta version.
So I suggest that you don't move the method in this ticket yet. We might rebase on next beta and then do the move.


I'm wondering if at the top of the `connectivity` file, we should not have 2 tables to distinguish methods for `Graph` and for `DiGraph`.

So I ran doctests on the whole sage library and left it to run while I was away. There were some 4-5 failed tests (in src/bin, src/build, src/mac-app and an import error in src/setup.py), but none of them had anything related to the graph module in their logs. But the better thing would be to wait for the patchbot I guess.

Okay. I have moved the method `blocks_and_cut_vertices` back to `generic_graph.py`. Will wait for the next beta version.

Yes, this does make it more clear. I have made the change now and split it into tables.

In general, `./sage -tp --long src/sage/` is enough.

For the patchbot, you have to set your patch to `needs review` I think.

For some reasons, I cannot check the html documentation. Have you built it and checked that it displays well ?

Replying to [dcoudert](#comment%3A23):
> My only concern here is in the documentation / doctests, since you changed for instance `G.is_connected()` to `is_connected(G)`.


Since the methods are now in the connectivity.pyx file and not defined along with the `GenericGraph` class, I changed the doctests to 

```
from sage.graphs.connectivity import is_connected
is_connected(G)
```

`G.is_connected()` also works and gives the same output as `is_connected(G)` since `GenericGraph` class redirects to the method in `connectivity.pyx`. All the doctests passed with `is_connected(G)`. Should I add in the documentation that `G.is_connected()` will also work?

@meghana: 
- In the doctest, I think it's good to show that `G.is_connected()` is working.
- Let aliases in `generic_graph.py` and other files. We don't want to change the usage, it's just a gathering of methods in a new file.
- Concerning doctests failure, I discovered some errors in graph generators and opened ticket #25465. I don't know what's going on, and what's the cause of these issues.

I don't have this issue. I have build the documentation and links are OK. For instance, in `generic_graph.html`, I have:

```
<p>We referred to <a class="reference internal" href="../../../references/index.html#harpri" id="id3">[HarPri]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../../../references/index.html#gallai" id="id4">[Gallai]</a> for blocks and cuts tree.</p>
```
and in `connectivity.html`

```
We implement the algorithm proposed by Tarjan in <a class="reference internal" href="../../../references/index.html#tarjan72" id="id1">[Tarjan72]</a>.
```
Have you tried `make doc-clean` ?

Thankyou, `make doc-clean` worked. It had given me an error when I had run it a few days ago and running `make` after it did not fix anything - this was due to duplicate citations which I fixed later. So I did not want to run `make doc-clean` again. But it worked now.
