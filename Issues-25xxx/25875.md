<a id='comment:19'></a>Some little things:

```
-all([type(sym)==Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring for sym in local_symbols]):
+all(isinstance(sym, Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring) for sym in local_symbols):
```
(unless you really specifically only want that one type. Also note the lack of list comprehension (there is another `all` test that should remove it as well).

Generally, we do alignment like this:

```
    - ``factored_determinant`` -- (default: ``None``) a factorization object
      the factored determinant of ``A``
```

You're also responsible should any complaints arise about the changes to the interface (although I do think it is highly unlikely) since you are changing it without deprecation.

Okay. I agree that it is highly unlikely. 
Indeed, there are three entry points that remain unchanged:
`sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus`
`sage.quadratic_forms.quadratic_form.global_genus_symbol`
`sage.modules.free_quadratic_module_integer_symmetric.genus`
