This is from GiNaC:

```
sage: w0=SR.wild(0); w1=SR.wild(1); w2=SR.wild(2)
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0+w1))
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0+w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
ssage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0*w1))  # no output: fail
sage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0*w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
```

Matching practically works if wildcards are not repeated. This means it's unusable for serious work.

In contrast Mathematica differentiates between `f[a + b + u_] := u` where `f` does not match `a+b`, and `f[a + b + u___] := u` with `f[a + b] = Sequence[]`.
