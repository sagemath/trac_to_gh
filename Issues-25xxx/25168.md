This is from GiNaC:

```
sage: w0=SR.wild(0); w1=SR.wild(1); w2=SR.wild(2)
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0+w1))
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0+w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
ssage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0*w1))  # no output: fail
sage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0*w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
```

Matching practically works if wildcards are not repeated. This means it's unusable for serious work.

This branch adds extensive doctest cases in a file under `tests/`

It should be noted that GiNaC's match() also does not differentiate between regular and sequence variables, they behave as regular in nonassociative functions, but as sequence in sums and products.

In contrast Mathematica differentiates between `f[a + b + u_] := u` where `f` does not match `a+b`, and `f[a + b + u___] := u` with `f[a + b] = Sequence[]`.
