Currently, assumptions are not always taken into account by `solve`.

```
sage: assume(x > 0)

# incorrectly gives [x < -1]
sage: solve(x^2 > 1, x)
[[x < -1], [x > 1]]

# correctly restricts
sage: solve(x^2 == 1, x)
[x == 1]
```

This seems to be a issue, because the aformentioned example is trivial but for more complicated examples, it leads to a serious deviation in results. 
My best guess is solve doesn't coherently involve the condition before it, solve simply proceeds as per as the equation given
