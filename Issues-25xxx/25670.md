I leave it up to you what to do, but it would be more consistent to follow the pattern I've taken in other Popen cases of passing encoding arguments on Python 3, as in: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/faa92a74f4143b0618c8578dd0b426105b3bbe79

An advantage to this approach is that in the (untested) case where lines are returned from `stderr` they will also be returned as `str`, not `bytes` (though this is a good case to use `errors='surrogateescape'` in case something goes completely wrong and the stream contains garbage).

In fact this pattern is common enough (I've used it in some other places as well) that we probably ought to have a convenience function for it.  But I haven't done so because I didn't want to get delayed by bikeshedding over its interface...
