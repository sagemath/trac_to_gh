Python's `multiprocessing.Pool` hangs when a `BaseException` that is not an `Excepion` happens in the function it runs; we need to wrap these in "normal" Exception's so they get thrown correctly by the pool's `get`.

Here's a minimal Python session to showcase this problem:

Do you have any idea what's causing a non-`Exception` exception to be raised from the docbuild?

The only thing I can think of is if it's an exception coming from Cysignals, and even then it's not clear what the exception would be in that case (an alarm, maybe?)

Otherwise the fix certainly makes sense.

Huge +1 (disclaimer: I wrote that doctest forker).

`multiprocessing` is broken in many ways. For this ticket, wouldn't it be possible to patch `multiprocessing` instead? That way, all users of `multiprocessing` would benefit, not only the docbuilder.

I observed this problem in a CI run, so I don't think it's a KeyboardInterrupt. But you're right, the above example can not be killed with Ctrl-c. It just prints the KeyboardInterrupt on Python 2.7. (Works on Python 3.6.)

That seems to make the docbuild hang. But that's an Exception, so the problem there seems to be something else.

This is only slightly related, but I wanted to bring this other patch to your attention:

https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/master/debian/patches/df-subprocess-sphinx.patch

If that is adopted, a side-effect (I think) would be to avoid the need for this patch, since all errors would instead become CalledProcessErrors.

I think what Jeroen means is as a more robust alternative to using `multiprocessing.Pool.map` and the like, as is currently used by the docbuilder.

My prototype implementation was compatible with (and this is why it was a bit difficult to get right) [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) API, albeit extended to cover the additional features that the doctest runner has, such as capturing standard I/O from the worker processes.

It's possible that if a process is taking too long, or otherwise going beyond its allowed resource usage the CI runner tries to stop it, and it might start out "nice" and just send Ctrl-Cs, though it also might move on to SIGTERM and/or SIGKILL.

It sounds to me like the enormous memory usage of the docbuild might still be a problem for #24655.  We may need to try to do more work on fixing that...
