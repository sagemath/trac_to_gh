I set `SAGE_CHECK="yes"` to run tests on the spkgs and I get the error below when I run `make -j5`.

Attach the complete log, not just "section from end". That way we can see which compiler you are using.

I'm reproducibly getting the same error on a Debian Sid amd64 system (log attached). (I am using the system gcc & ccache if that makes any difference.)

I guess "internal compiler error" means gcc is crashing. Any help on how to go about debugging this so I can file a proper bug report with gcc upstream would be much appreciated.

I get this error when doing `make`, but so far I've not managed to figure out what precise `gcc` command is triggering this and what environmental variables are set. Any suggestions on how to figure this out?
