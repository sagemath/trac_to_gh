"internal compiler error" typically means a broken compiler or a hardware problem. Is the error reproducible, does it happen again if you try again?

Attach the complete log, not just "section from end". That way we can see which compiler you are using.

I'm reproducibly getting the same error on a Debian Sid amd64 system (log attached). (I am using the system gcc & ccache if that makes any difference.)

I guess "internal compiler error" means gcc is crashing. Any help on how to go about debugging this so I can file a proper bug report with gcc upstream would be much appreciated.

I get this error when doing `make`, but so far I've not managed to figure out what precise `gcc` command is triggering this and what environmental variables are set. Any suggestions on how to figure this out?

This bug has now been fixed in `gcc` trunk, so it will not affect `gcc 9.0` once that is released.

It's not yet clear to me if the fix will get backported to the `gcc-8` branch in time for `gcc 8.3`, which is likely to be released pretty soon.

When we install GCC, we install a very recent one,
but we still accept older system versions.

We are only removing support for GCC < 6.3 in #33316.

If i understand correctly, the bug is a bug of gcc 8 itself, not of some Sage component or build system. So, if the user uses their own buggy gcc 8, there is nothing we can do.
