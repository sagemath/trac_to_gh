```
When running the test suite on Cygwin, whether a test passes or fails the test log is full (for each test module of output like):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/gap.py
Exception OSError: (2, 'No such file or directory', '/tmp/tmpwVkVtd') in <bound method _TemporaryFileWrapper.__del__ of <closed file '<fdopen>', mode 'w+b' at 0x6f8032f1e40>> ignored
    [224 tests, 49.25 s]
```

in particular this of course causes tests of the doctest runner itself to fail, and it's also making all the patchbot runs fail.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:12):
> The real problem is that the file is closed twice: once in the master process and once in the child. It can only be deleted once.

Right, that's whole point.  I more or less wrote that in the comment but I guess it should have been clearer...

Perhaps to give slightly more detail as well, regarding the usage/implementation of the `tempfile` module (which I agree with you is a bit crummy):

In Sage here we are using the `TemporaryFile` factory (which despite the CamelCase is actually function).  This basically uses `mkstemp` to create a unique filename, then returns a file-like object around the file descriptor and immediately calls `os.unlink` on the filename (effectively deleting the file as soon as it's no longer needed.

However, there is also `NamedTemporaryFile` which does not immediately unlink the name, so that the file can have a name that can be used in other processes, for example.  In this case it's up to the user to delete the file, although it has an auto-delete functionality `delete=True` enabled by default in fact, that deletes the file after it is closed in `__del__`.  Unfortunately the implementation is a bit buggy, I think, since there's an unhandled exception if the file was already deleted when it gets to this point :(

The problem arises here because the `tempfile` quietly *replaces* `TemporaryFile` with `NamedTemporaryFile` on non-POSIX systems and on Cygwin, since the ability to delete a file while it has an open file descriptor is not guaranteed on other platforms.  This is actually annoying for a couple reasons:

1) `NamedTemporaryFile` and `TemporaryFile` have different APIs, and this switch is done rather implicitly.  You also get the aforementioned buggy behavior of `NamedTemporaryFile` when it comes to double-deletes.

2) At least on Cygwin this is unnecessary.  It might have been a concession to an older version of Cygwin (this hack seems to have been in place for a while).  But it's not necessary at all on more modern versions of Cygwin which do allow unlinking open files.

So the problem is that on Cygwin the `TemporaryFile` gets replaced with a `NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=True` (which can be detected through presence of the `delete` attribute, though an explicit `isinstance` check could also be possible).  And, as Jeroen wrote, this means that because that `NamedTemporaryFile` is instantiated before forking, it exists in two processes, and whichever one happens to close the file first deletes it.  Then the process that closes the file second produces this annoying unhandled exception in `__del__` message.

This has actually been a problem for a long time, and I've seen it show up in the tests before rather randomly.  But it was relatively uncommon since most of the time the file was closed first in the parent process and we didn't see the message from the child process.

Also, while I'm calling the behavior of `NamedTemporaryFile` "buggy" with respect to double deletions, it may in fact be intentional, as this could point toward a programming error of some kind (which I believe is in fact the case here).
