Updates several miscellaneous packages for #24024:

* gfan
* lcalc
* ratpoints
* rubiks
* symmetrica

These packages don't specifically have anything in common here except for being standard packages with somewhat unusual custom install scripts, but that aren't particularly complicated either.


Keywords: **destdir gfan lcalc ratpoints rubiks symmetrica**
