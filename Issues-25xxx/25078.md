This used to be a convenient way to force-rebuild the whole Sage library:

```
$ ./sage -f sagelib
...
Error: package 'sagelib' not found
Note: if it is an old-style package, use -p instead of -i to install it
```

Similar for `./sage -f doc`.

This reminds me, it's been on my TODO list to just make "sagelib" another spkg (with some special disposition that allows its "source" to be found and built in a local directory rather than downloaded as a tarball and extracted to a temp dir).  I'm not sure why this would be broken now though.

In `src/bin/sage` there's a kind of hackish "grep" of `build/make/Makefile` to ensure that the argument to `./sage -f` (mostly assumed to be name of an SPKG) is actually a make target.  But it seems from the usage you describe here, really `./sage -f` should work for almost any make target, not just SPKGs. 

I guess either the check could be made more generic or just removed entirely.

Also is this actually documented behavior?  If not I wouldn't consider it a "blocker".  The `--help` just says of `-f` "force build of the given Sage packages".  It's not clear to me whether "sagelib" and "doc" are considered "Sage packages" (per my above comment maybe the should be...)

It is actually by design that `./sage -i` works that way. So maybe the easiest fix is removing this check:

```
        # First check that $PKG is actually a Makefile target
        # Since https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21524 there is not explicitly
        # a target for the package, but if it has a vers_<pkgname> variable
        # there will also be a generated rule for it
        if ! grep "^vers_$PKG = " build/make/Makefile >/dev/null; then
            echo >&2 "Error: package '$PKG' not found"
            echo >&2 "Note: if it is an old-style package, use -p instead of -i to install it"
            exit 1
        fi
```

FWIW I don't think 'build' commands should be combined into Sage's runtime interface at all.  The sole exception might be `sage -i` (or an equivalent) for installing optional packages, and even that has its problems.
