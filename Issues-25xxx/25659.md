Using the fast iterator from perfect matchings, we get a nice speedup for the Brauer algebra:

```
sage: %timeit len([SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(6)])
1 loop, best of 3: 6.69 s per loop
```

```
sage: %timeit len([SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(6)])
1 loop, best of 3: 180 ms per loop
```

Quick comments (I will comment on #25462 either later this week or next week since I am at FPSAC this week):

- It seems like the `iter_aux` should be pulled out as a separate method (maybe even function?) of `PerfectMatchings` and called directly by the Brauer diagrams iterator (it makes no sense to create the temporary element object).

- When checking going to the orbit basis, if you are not going to use `an_element` (which I still recommend using as it should not be machine dependent), then at least use a sum of 2 or more basis elements with at least one coefficient as that is a better test.

- Bikeshedding again on the condensed output (as before, you can ignore, but I still will mention it):
  {{{#!diff
         sage: [SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(5/2)]
-        [{{-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}}, {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}, {{-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1, 2}}]
+        [{{-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1, 2}},
+         {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
+         {{-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}}]
  }}}

Otherwise LGTM (modulo #25462) and is quite a speedup. I do wonder if `_iterator_part` did not return `Set` objects, what the speed difference would be, but we can address that on a later ticket.

as for #25462: please provide a name, so there is at least some uniformity across sage.  And again, since it is not unlikely that one does several computations in the same (Brauer) algebra, it might make more sense to use `.list()`, which caches the result.

Here is where I am currently at:

```
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(10): pass
CPU times: user 4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4 ms
Wall time: 964 µs
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(16): pass
CPU times: user 796 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 824 ms
Wall time: 794 ms
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(20): pass
CPU times: user 3min 49s, sys: 8 ms, total: 3min 49s
Wall time: 3min 49s
```
versus with your branch:

```
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(10): pass
CPU times: user 8 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 12 ms
Wall time: 7.14 ms
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(16): pass
CPU times: user 14.4 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 14.4 s
Wall time: 14.4 s
```
The timing for 20 would take far too long (extrapolating, somewhere between 30-90 minutes).
I am pretty sure I can make this faster by better controlling what integers to look at.

BTW:

```
sage: PerfectMatchings(20).cardinality()
654729075
```

Impressive!  Is this (essentially) the same algorithm?

I was thinking about calling all these iterators `iterator_raw` (or `raw_iterator`), with the specification that calling the parent on them "works".

However, now they actually only work for the base set `0,1,...`, which makes even more sense, but doesn't fit this specification :-)

Yes, although how I find the "next" available entry I can add is dumb (search through a list). What I want to do is make it more linked-list like so I can quickly add and remove entires. However, this requires me to be a little more smart about how I do things.

This is purely something for speed. If you want to call the parent on them, well, that's why we have the parents. ;)

Great!

I created #26065 - it would almost certainly be better to create restricted growth functions directly with Walsh's Gray code.  Just in case someone is bored :-) 

From your last two commits, it seems that the order of generation for the set partition iterator changed again - I don't care much, but it does seem strange.

Walsh's paper has actually appeared, here is a citation:

```
@article {MR1821628,
    AUTHOR = {Walsh, Timothy},
     TITLE = {Gray codes for involutions},
   JOURNAL = {J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput.},
  FJOURNAL = {Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial
              Computing},
    VOLUME = {36},
      YEAR = {2001},
     PAGES = {95--118},
      ISSN = {0835-3026},
   MRCLASS = {05A05 (68R05)},
  MRNUMBER = {1821628},
MRREVIEWER = {Theodore C. Enns},
}
```

I found that the different order comes from an additional `sorted` in `SetPartitions_set.__iter__`, so there is nothing to worry about.

I added a reference, I'm happy with positive review.
