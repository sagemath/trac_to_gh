```
Using the fast iterator from perfect matchings, we get a nice speedup for the Brauer algebra:

```
sage: %timeit len([SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(6)])
1 loop, best of 3: 6.69 s per loop
```

```
sage: %timeit len([SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(6)])
1 loop, best of 3: 180 ms per loop
```

Depends on #25462
Depends on #26111

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Quick comments (I will comment on #25462 either later this week or next week since I am at FPSAC this week):

- It seems like the `iter_aux` should be pulled out as a separate method (maybe even function?) of `PerfectMatchings` and called directly by the Brauer diagrams iterator (it makes no sense to create the temporary element object).

- When checking going to the orbit basis, if you are not going to use `an_element` (which I still recommend using as it should not be machine dependent), then at least use a sum of 2 or more basis elements with at least one coefficient as that is a better test.

- Bikeshedding again on the condensed output (as before, you can ignore, but I still will mention it):

  ```diff
           sage: [SetPartition(p) for p in da.brauer_diagrams(5/2)]
  -        [{{-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}}, {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}, {{-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1, 2}}]
  +        [{{-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1, 2}},
  +         {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
  +         {{-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}}]
  ```

Otherwise LGTM (modulo #25462) and is quite a speedup. I do wonder if `_iterator_part` did not return `Set` objects, what the speed difference would be, but we can address that on a later ticket.

Here is where I am currently at:

```
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(10): pass
CPU times: user 4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4 ms
Wall time: 964 µs
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(16): pass
CPU times: user 796 ms, sys: 28 ms, total: 824 ms
Wall time: 794 ms
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(20): pass
CPU times: user 3min 49s, sys: 8 ms, total: 3min 49s
Wall time: 3min 49s
```
versus with your branch:

```
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(10): pass
CPU times: user 8 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 12 ms
Wall time: 7.14 ms
sage: %time for x in PerfectMatchings(16): pass
CPU times: user 14.4 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 14.4 s
Wall time: 14.4 s
```
The timing for 20 would take far too long (extrapolating, somewhere between 30-90 minutes).
I am pretty sure I can make this faster by better controlling what integers to look at.

BTW:

```
sage: PerfectMatchings(20).cardinality()
654729075
```

Impressive!  Is this (essentially) the same algorithm?

I was thinking about calling all these iterators `iterator_raw` (or `raw_iterator`), with the specification that calling the parent on them "works".

However, now they actually only work for the base set `0,1,...`, which makes even more sense, but doesn't fit this specification :-)

Yes, although how I find the "next" available entry I can add is dumb (search through a list). What I want to do is make it more linked-list like so I can quickly add and remove entires. However, this requires me to be a little more smart about how I do things.

This is purely something for speed. If you want to call the parent on them, well, that's why we have the parents. ;)

Great!

I created #26065 - it would almost certainly be better to create restricted growth functions directly with Walsh's Gray code.  Just in case someone is bored :-) 

From your last two commits, it seems that the order of generation for the set partition iterator changed again - I don't care much, but it does seem strange.

Walsh's paper has actually appeared, here is a citation:

```
@article {MR1821628,
    AUTHOR = {Walsh, Timothy},
     TITLE = {Gray codes for involutions},
   JOURNAL = {J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput.},
  FJOURNAL = {Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial
              Computing},
    VOLUME = {36},
      YEAR = {2001},
     PAGES = {95--118},
      ISSN = {0835-3026},
   MRCLASS = {05A05 (68R05)},
  MRNUMBER = {1821628},
MRREVIEWER = {Theodore C. Enns},
}
```

I found that the different order comes from an additional `sorted` in `SetPartitions_set.__iter__`, so there is nothing to worry about.

I added a reference, I'm happy with positive review.
