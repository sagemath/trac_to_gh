We improve the algorithm computing the factor iterator in the implicit suffix tree of a word.

BEFORE:

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
Processus arrêté
```

AFTER:

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
CPU times: user 14 s, sys: 504 ms, total: 14.5 s
Wall time: 14.5 s
sage: len(L)

No. The reason is that there is no guarantee that iterating through a dictionary via `iteritems` you always get the same order (you can check that in the doctests there are `sorted` everywhere). But before this ticket, it was clearly not a DFS

With this ticket it is

I was asking in the description of the ticket not in a doctest.

Before this ticket, this just eats all the memory and CPU:

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
Processus arrêté
```

With the branch of this ticket, I get:

```
sage: w = words.FibonacciWord([0,1])
sage: it = w[:10000].suffix_tree().factor_iterator()
sage: %time L = list(it)
CPU times: user 14 s, sys: 504 ms, total: 14.5 s
Wall time: 14.5 s
sage: len(L)
24337601
```

So, it is definitely an improvement.
