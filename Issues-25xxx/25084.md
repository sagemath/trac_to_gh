Inverting a ring element usually produces an element in its fraction field.

When the ring element is invertible in its parent ring, it can be convenient
to obtain the inverse as an element in the same ring.

For consistency with other rings in Sage, the matrix ring method
`_invert_unit` should be renamed `inverse_of_unit`.

These are not changes from this ticket, but while we're focused on this piece of code...

When the matrix is not invertible in the ring, I raising a `ValueError` would make more sense than a `ZeroDivisionError`.

I would replace the method's description at the start of the docstring from the current

```
If self is a matrix with determinant `1` or `-1` return the inverse of
``self`` as a matrix over `ZZ`.
```

to the following:

```
Return the inverse of this matrix as a matrix over `ZZ`.

If the matrix is not invertible over `ZZ`, a value error is raised.
```

I don't know, maybe I would keep the `ZeroDivisionError` like in those cases:

```python
>>> (0)**-1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: 0.0 cannot be raised to a negative power

sage: 0^-1
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: rational division by zero

sage: A = Integers(6)
sage: a = A(2)
sage: a^-1
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```
