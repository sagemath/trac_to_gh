This is part of the meta-ticket #22982. 

The goal of the present ticket is to add code for computing finite and infinite maximal orders and ideals thereof. 

The central engine for computing maximal orders is the Leonard-Pellikaan-Singh-Swanson algorithm implemented in Singular. Most algorithms for computing with ideals are from Cohen's book  A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory.

The startup modules plugin complains that

```
New:
    _md5
    _sha
    _sha256
    _sha512
    sage.rings.function_field.element

    sage.rings.function_field.order
Removed:
    _hashlib

```

I don't really understand what is happening and how to deal with it. I suspect that this is somehow related with `__hash__` method in the ideal or order modules...

Travis, would you give me some tips?

So the last three extra imports are from this change to `function_field.py`:

```diff
+from .order import (
+    FunctionFieldOrder_basis,
+    FunctionFieldOrderInfinite_basis,
+    FunctionFieldMaximalOrder_rational,
+    FunctionFieldMaximalOrder_global,
+    FunctionFieldMaximalOrderInfinite_rational,
+    FunctionFieldMaximalOrderInfinite_global)
```
However, you seem to basically be doing these imports locally anyways. I would run `pyflakes` on the file to see what is being duplicated in terms of imports, and you should decide if they need to be at the module level.

I probably wouldn't worry about the others as they seem to be unrelated.

The code of this patch was written more than two years ago.  It might be the case that the normal.lib was then an experimental package. But I don't remember well.

Another reason that may still be relevant now is that the normalP in the singular library does more computations than necessary for my case. For example, it also computes delta invariants of the given ideal. So I decided to make a stripped-down light version of normalP just for the code in this ticket.

I am trying this approach. During computation, the Singular's version spits out many comments, each line starting with `//`, causing doctest failures. Do you know how to deal with this? 

```
Failed example:
    O = F.maximal_order()
Expected nothing
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    // ** WARNING: result is correct if ideal is prime (not checked) **
    // disable option "isPrim" to decompose ideal into prime components
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    // 'normalP' computed a list, say nor, of two lists:
    // To see the result, type
         nor;
    <BLANKLINE>
    // * nor[1] is a list of 1 ideal(s), where each ideal nor[1][i] consists
    // of elements g1..gk of the basering R such that gj/gk generate the integral
    // closure of R/P_i (where P_i is a min. associated prime of the input ideal)
    // as R-module in the quotient field of R/P_i;
    <BLANKLINE>
    // * nor[2] shows the delta-invariant of each component and of the input ideal
    // (-1 means infinite, and 0 that R/P_i is normal).

    "body": "<a id='comment:33'></a>\nI have been able to make it through the code. I cannot vouch so much for the mathematical correctness, but it does work as documented. Here are my comments about the code:\n\n- For `order_infinite_with_basis`, did you want `*basis` instead of `basis` as an input (in which case, you will have to have `check` be part of a `**kwds`)? Or do you expect people to pass a list with a single list of basis elements inside?\n- Can you construct `FunctionFieldMaximalOrder(Infinite)_global` with having a different basis? It feels like these classes should just take one input, `FunctionField(_global)`, which then has a hook to construct the corresponding basis (or maybe do this computation on-demand in the class itself). This would allow `FunctionFieldOrder` to inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` and `maximal_order_infinite()` to not be cached. I don't see how `FunctionFieldOrder` and subclasses are compared/hashed by default (the default `Parent.__hash__` using the string representation is a horrible hash too).\n- I am pretty sure there is a bug in the caching of `vector_space` as the key is always return `None`, so the `base` parameter is ignored. Actually, you do not need to have a key here because you error out when `base is not None`. Is this for compatibility with something else? Does `base**1` do something? I feel like it should just be `base`. I guess some of this is a hold-over from the old code, so it is not a big issue.\n- In all of the `__init__` tests, it would be good to have `TestSuite(I).run()` (especially over a `type(I)` call IMO). I would also move the `INPUT:` block outside of the `__init__` and into the class-level doc so that it is visible from the html doc.\n- `Returns` -> `Return` (in `base_ring()`).\n- Note that `_rmul_` (like `_lmul_`) can have general input as they are designed to be hooks for actions. (Not that this is necessarily wrong here, but I just want to make sure this has all of the behaviors you are expecting.)\n- I don't see the point of having `_gens_over_base`. It is only called from `gens_over_base` and could be moved into there.\n- Instead of handling your own custom cache with `_two_gens`, I would just `@cached_method` `gens_two`.\n- You should make sure the result of `basis_matrix` is an immutable matrix by adding `m.set_immutable()`.\n- I don't like avoiding `self`: it makes you have strange sentences like `Return the ideal below the ideal.`, which I might even argue is close to ill-defined (which ideal is the ideal?).\n- Same comment about custom cache for `_is_prime`.\n- A better way from `category or IntegralDomains()` to get the category might be `IntegralDomains().or_subcategory(category)` (works fine when `category=None`). You can also then tack on `category = category.Infinite()` and then remove the `is_finite` method.\n- You don't need to cache `ideal_monoid`, at least the `IdealMonoid` class is better as a `UniqueRepresentation`.\n- Error messages should start with a lowercase letter (as per our convention).\n- Some little doc formatting things:\n\n  ```diff\n         - ``gens`` -- list of elements that are a basis for the\n-             ideal over the maximal order of the base field\n+           ideal over the maximal order of the base field\n  ```\n\n  ```diff\n        - ``gens`` -- list of generators or an ideal in a ring which coerces\n-          to this order.\n+          to this order\n  ```\n- Some micro-optimizations:\n\n  ```diff\n-        basis = [V(sigma_a_pow[j]*beta_pow[i]) for i in range(s) for j in range(r)]\n+        basis = [V(sap * bp) for bp in beta_pow for sap in sigma_a_pow]\n         W = V.span_of_basis(basis)\n \n         def to_K(f):\n             coeffs = (f % q).list()\n-            return sum([sigma(coeffs[i]) * beta_pow[i] for i in range(len(coeffs))], K.zero())\n+            return sum((sigma(c) * beta_pow[i] for i, c in enumerate(coeffs)), K.zero())\n \n         if r == 1: # take care of the prime field case\n             def fr_K(g):\n                 co = W.coordinates(V(g),check=False)\n                 return R([k(co[j]) for j in range(s)])\n         else:\n-            t = r * s\n             def fr_K(g):\n                 co = W.coordinates(V(g),check=False)\n-                return R([k(co[i:i+r]) for i in range(0,t,r)])\n+                return R([k(co[i:i+r]) for i in range(0,r*s,r)])\n  ```\n  (well, the last changes are for readability, less variables to keep track of).\n- Micro-optimization: in `mul_vecs`, you might want to move `self._mtable[i]` part out of the `for j in range(n):` loop to avoid the extra lookups.\n- I think it is bad form to use raises of errors to dictate program flow.

I have been able to make it through the code. I cannot vouch so much for the mathematical correctness, but it does work as documented. Here are my comments about the code:

- For `order_infinite_with_basis`, did you want `*basis` instead of `basis` as an input (in which case, you will have to have `check` be part of a `**kwds`)? Or do you expect people to pass a list with a single list of basis elements inside?

It feels like these classes should just take one input, `FunctionField(_global)`, which then has a hook to construct the corresponding basis (or maybe do this computation on-demand in the class itself). This would allow `FunctionFieldOrder` to inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` and `maximal_order_infinite()` to not be cached. I don't see how `FunctionFieldOrder` and subclasses are compared/hashed by default (the default `Parent.__hash__` using the string representation is a horrible hash too).

- `Returns` -> `Return` (in `base_ring()`).
- Note that `_rmul_` (like `_lmul_`) can have general input as they are designed to be hooks for actions. (Not that this is necessarily wrong here, but I just want to make sure this has all of the behaviors you are expecting.)
- I don't see the point of having `_gens_over_base`. It is only called from `gens_over_base` and could be moved into there.
- Instead of handling your own custom cache with `_two_gens`, I would just `@cached_method` `gens_two`.
- You should make sure the result of `basis_matrix` is an immutable matrix by adding `m.set_immutable()`.
- I don't like avoiding `self`: it makes you have strange sentences like `Return the ideal below the ideal.`, which I might even argue is close to ill-defined (which ideal is the ideal?).
- Same comment about custom cache for `_is_prime`.
- A better way from `category or IntegralDomains()` to get the category might be `IntegralDomains().or_subcategory(category)` (works fine when `category=None`). You can also then tack on `category = category.Infinite()` and then remove the `is_finite` method.
- You don't need to cache `ideal_monoid`, at least the `IdealMonoid` class is better as a `UniqueRepresentation`.
- Error messages should start with a lowercase letter (as per our convention).
- Some little doc formatting things:

  ```diff
         - ``gens`` -- list of elements that are a basis for the
-             ideal over the maximal order of the base field
+           ideal over the maximal order of the base field
  ```

  ```diff
        - ``gens`` -- list of generators or an ideal in a ring which coerces
-          to this order.
+          to this order
  ```
- Some micro-optimizations:

  ```diff
-        basis = [V(sigma_a_pow[j]*beta_pow[i]) for i in range(s) for j in range(r)]
+        basis = [V(sap * bp) for bp in beta_pow for sap in sigma_a_pow]
         W = V.span_of_basis(basis)
 
         def to_K(f):
             coeffs = (f % q).list()
-            return sum([sigma(coeffs[i]) * beta_pow[i] for i in range(len(coeffs))], K.zero())

  ```
  (well, the last changes are for readability, less variables to keep track of).
- Micro-optimization: in `mul_vecs`, you might want to move `self._mtable[i]` part out of the `for j in range(n):` loop to avoid the extra lookups.
- I think it is bad form to use raises of errors to dictate program flow. I think a better way in `_ideal_from_vectors_and_denominator` (which should be faster too) is to have

  ```python
                M = []
                g = d
                for v in vecs:
                    for c in l:
                        g = g.gcd(c)
                        if g.is_one():
                            break
                    else:
                        M += l
                        continue
                    break
                else:
                    d = d // g
                    mat = matrix(R, len(vecs), [c // g for c in M])
  ```
  where the `else` block is run iff the loop did not run to completion. You could also dispatch this to an internal function that would return `mat` or `None` upon failure.
- Is there a clear benefit to having `mtable` a list of vectors, as opposed to a list of lists or a `Matrix` object?
- Isn't this block of the `div` in Buchman-Lenstra algorithm just the same as `mul_vec`?

  ```
                        c = 0
                        for i in range(n):
                            for j in range(n):
                                c += a[i] * b[j] * mtable[i][j]
  ```
  Perhaps there would be a benefit from cythonizing `mul_vec` considering how frequently it is used.

The code seems to be intended to support these three cases:

```
L.order_infinite_with_basis([1/x,1/x*y, 1/x^2*y^2])

L.order_infinite_with_basis([1/x])

L.order_infinite_with_basis(1/x)
```

But this is not described in the docstring. Also this is not consistent with `order_with_basis`. Hence I will remove the responsible code from `order_infinite_with_basis`. Happily, there is no doctest failure because of this.

They are subclasses of `Parent`, correct? Things work faster/better in regard to, say, coercion and equality with `UniqueRepresentation`. It is also faster to compare for equality and hash (just use the `id` in both cases). Speaking of which, because of the MRO, it is better to have `UniqueRepresentation` as the first class.

There was a typo here. I meant:

`Order_basis` class does *not* have unique representation behavior. It could have cached representation behavior. But I don't see a reason to force this.

I agree. But `EquationOrder(Infinite)` class is something that I do not expect to be subclassed. Anyway now it occurs to me that I can just get rid of this class, and use the superclass`Order_basis`.

This is not my code. But it seems not a bug to me.  The intention is to force base to `self` (a rational function field) if given, since `self` is the only reasonable base field for a rational function field. If F is a rational function field,

```
F.vector_space()  ---> Ok. The base is F.
F.vector_space(F) ---> Ok. The base is F.
F.vector_space(G) ---> Raise an error.
```
For the first two cases, the cache key is `None`. On the other hand, `base**1` creates a vector space over `base` of dimension 1.

It is for consistency. Note that general function fields also have `vector_space`, for which it is reasonable to take a `base` argument. Thus, perhaps, one can write generic code for function fields, rational or not. This is not my design.

I could finally understand the basics of the interplay of Parents, Elements, and Categories. Thank you.\n\n\nI am glad to hear you were able to learn some new stuff.

Replying to [klee](#comment%3A49):
> It was instructive to add `TestSuites` for all parents. I could finally understand the basics of the interplay of Parents, Elements, and Categories. Thank you.


I am glad to hear you were able to learn some new stuff. It looks like you were able to reduce the redundancy.

I have a few additional small comments:

Error messages should not be proper sentences (so not starting with a capital letter and ending with a period/full-stop):

```diff
-        if n != 0: raise IndexError("Only one generator.")
+        if n != 0:
+            raise IndexError("only one generator")
         return self._gen
```
(This is a general Python convention.)
Same also for `raise IndexError("Only {} generators".format(self.ngens()))`.

These type of changes do not seem to be correct to me:

```
        m = self.ideal_monoid()
        m.Element = FunctionFieldIdeal_rational
```
The `Element` attribute should be set by the corresponding parent before `Parent.__init__` is called, as does the appropriate setup (e.g., constructing `element_class`). The thing do do would be to have a hook (via a attribute) that is looked at by `IdealMonoid` in its `__init__` which then sets its `Element` attribute, e.g.:

```
self.Element = R._ideal_class
```
Also, is there a use-case for someone to pass an `ideal_class` to `ideal` or `ideal_with_gens_over_base`? If so, then this hook I mentioned above should be removed and the `ideal_class` should instead be an additional construction parameter for `IdealMonoid`.

Trivial formatting:

```diff
         - ``gens`` -- list of elements that are a basis for the
-              ideal over the maximal order of the base field
+          ideal over the maximal order of the base field
```

If you want to enforce a particular subcategory for input, you can do:

```diff
-category or IntegralDomains()
+category = IntegralDomains().or_subcategory(category)
```
(for `None`, this becomes `IntegralDomains()`).

I can also look into why the facade parents are not behaving well once the above is done.

No problem. Enjoy your holidays.

Ok.

Perhaps not. This is a left-over from existing code. I tried to clean this up.

The function field orders are facade parents, because the parent of elements of an order is just the function field. What seems to me a bug is that  some category tests intended for normal parents are still applied to facade parents. For example, `_test_one`, `_test_zero`.

I guess `_gens_over_base` was introduced for efficiency when I implemented "places" and "divisors" on top of orders and ideals. As that is not needed here, I removed it. I may reintroduce it in a later ticket.

> - Micro-optimization: in `mul_vecs`, you might want to move `self._mtable[i]` part out of the `for j in range(n):` loop to avoid the extra lookups.


The benefit seems negligible. I left this as it is, for readability. 

> - Is there a clear benefit to having `mtable` a list of vectors, as opposed to a list of lists or a `Matrix` object?


It is a list of a list of vectors.

>   Perhaps there would be a benefit from cythonizing `mul_vec` considering how frequently it is used.


Locating parts to be cythonized is a general issue that I should tackle some day, after learning more cython.
