Tarball: http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20180815.tar.bz2

The tarball was updated and this should fix these issues (no patching required).  No code changes, only autotools stuff and the version is now v20180815.

*outdated*, for the update to 20180710:

I'm currently having issues with this update for nix[1]. I will try to see if I can reproduce those issues with sage-the distribution.

With nix I get the following error building sagelib:

```

```

Which sounds more like an eclib error than just a changed interface. Might have something to do with eclibs changelog entry[2]

> Reorganised all include files so each may be included by itself.


Specifically the file in question (`types.h`) gained some preprocessor instructions that are probably relevant[3].
