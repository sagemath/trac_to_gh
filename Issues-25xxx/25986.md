This ticket includes changes for cell complexes and in general files in `src/sage/homology` for Python 3 compatibility. There are several types of changes:

- make sure data are sorted consistently, when they need to be sorted, and in particular for homology calculations. In particular, `GenericCellComplex`, the class from which the other main ones in this directory inherit, now has a method `_n_cells_sorted` which does what its name says. This way the sorting is centralized, so we don't have to do it separately in each file and perhaps do it inconsistently between one file and another.

- make sure data are sorted in doctests, so that doctests are consistent between Python 2 and Python 3.

- bug fixes: the first type of changes led to the discovery of a few bugs. Python 3 doctests kept insisting that certain answers were wrong, and I eventually realized that they were indeed wrong. Some of this was due to sorting inconsistencies, and there was at least one other – the map induced in cohomology by a map of simplicial complexes should be dual to the map induced in homology (as long as we have field coefficients), and this was not the case, because the cohomology situation was just wrong in the code.

When I run doctests with Python 2, of course everything passes. With Python 3, there are still failures, but they are beyond the scope of this ticket. The remaining failures:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --warn-long 55.6 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 27 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 55.6 src/sage/homology/examples.py  # 10 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
This is contrast to Sage-8.3.rc2 + #25929, built with Python 3:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 43 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/cubical_complex.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_morphism.py  # 33 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_examples.py  # 12 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/examples.py  # 13 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_constructions.py  # 96 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/homology_morphism.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/chain_complex.py  # 7 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_set.py  # 68 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex_morphism.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/chains.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/chain_complex_morphism.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/koszul_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/chain_homotopy.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_catalog.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex_homset.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.0 src/sage/homology/homology_vector_space_with_basis.py  # 32 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The remaining failures are of three types:

- inconsistencies in print representations for some rings, and I think Python 3 is better than Python 2 here. For example

```

```
 and

I think it redundant to do

Just do the test with sorted output and if you feel it is necessary (I don't), you can explain with a comment why we are sorting things.

I am not sure I agree with deprecating `n_faces` and not just making it an alias of `n_cells`. At least, when I think of simplicial complexes, I would call them faces before cells.

That's fine with me.

I don't feel strongly about it. I thought that a general Python philosophy was to not have multiple ways of doing exactly the same thing. The previous docstring for `n_faces` could be interpreted as a weak deprecation ("This method is not used elsewhere in Sage."), but I don't mind leaving it as an alias.

I think having `n_faces` is useful from a user-interface POV.

Thank you. LGTM.
