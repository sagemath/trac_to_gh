1. To simplify `setup.py` logic, this file is renamed to `ntlwrap_impl.h`.

2. Unused functions are removed.

3. In `.pxd` files, fix filenames in `cdef extern` statements: use the correct `ntlwrap.h` for things that really come from NTL itself (and not from `ntlwrap_impl.h`)

4. The trivial functions `del_charstar` and `int_to_ZZ_p` are replaced by a Cython cname.
