Keywords: exterior algebra

As an example

```
sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(ZZ, 'e', 5)
sage: phi = E.lift_morphism(identity_matrix(5))
sage: phi.category_for()
Category of super algebras with basis over Integer Ring
```
So we loose out on a bunch of methods that should be there

I am probably paranoid, but are all our Clifford algebras finite-dimensional? I don't know what can go into a `QuadraticForm`, so I can't tell...
