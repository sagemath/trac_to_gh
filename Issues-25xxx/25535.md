This works:

```
$ wget http://wstein.org/loadtest.py
$ cat loadtest.py 
print "hi from the net"

print 2+3
```

But it does not work from Sage:

```
sage: sage.repl.load.load('http://wstein.org/loadtest.py', globals())
  File "/home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py", line 1
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This allows to understand the problem:

```
sage: !cat /home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<head>
<title>Access denied | wstein.org used Cloudflare to restrict access</title>

Is the point of that doctest to fetch a random python file from a webpage over http and execute it? If so, we should probably remove the doctest instead or amend it to use a local file / check the hash of the file first.

The issue that Cloudflare blocks the default python useragent was already encountered at #25222. We have a workaround there as well.

Indeed the wisdom in executing a file fetched from the internet relatively blindly is questionable.

As suggested by nbruin, I added some User-Agent in `get_remote_file`. The problem is that I now use `urlopen` instead of `urlretrieve`. Thus, I can not specify the `report_hook` anymore which was used by the `verbose`.

I set it to `needs_review` to get some feedback by the patchbots.

In my opinion the security issue of fetching an executing a file from the internet (especially over HTTP) should also be addressed. Although you could argue that it is out of scope in this ticket, maybe it can be combined.

But worse is the possibility of the request jost being MITM'd by *anybody* on the network since it is fetched over HTTP. So if you're running the sage doctests in a public wifi, anybody else in that wifi could execute code on your computer.

Possible solutions include
- first downloading the file, then verifying the contents match a hash, then loading it
- just loading a local file

Do we really need to test that we can fetch a file from the internet? Thats more or less a python primitive. And if we need to test that we can and should test it seperately from the `load` mechanism.

I rebased on top of the most recent beta and I added a commit.

There are three issues begin dealt in this ticket:

- `get_remote_file` was broken
- `get_remote_file` was not properly tested (even broken, the doctests were passing)
- `load` was loading a file from the http which is not secure

I believe the proposed two commits solves the above 3 issues (needs review).

There is one small thing that I am still not able to preserve. It is the loading bar of dots `........` as in:

```
sage: get_remote_file('http://www.sagemath.org/files/loadtest.py', verbose=True)
Attempting to load remote file: http://www.sagemath.org/files/loadtest.py
Loading: [.................]    
```

which used to be printed with the help of the `report_hook` which I can not use anymore since I replaced the call to `urlretrieve` by a call to `urlopen`:

```diff
-        urlretrieve(filename, temp_name, report_hook)
+        content = urlopen(req, timeout=1)
+        with open(temp_name, 'w') as f:
+            f.write(content.read())
```

Somebody has a solution? (... one of them being getting rid of the report_hook thing)

yes, this was because of the `urlretrieve` that I am replacing by `urlopen`. I was waiting for an answer to my previous comment before removing the `import urlretrieve`...

I removed it now and rebased the branch on top of 8.4.rc0

Others `urlopen` usage in sage don't seems to display a kind of "Download progress bar" and in my opinion something like "Loading started" and "Loading ended" is enough for the verbose mode. It's still possible to implement a read chunk by chunk if it's really needed.

Either way the remaining `report_hook` function and `cur` global variable should be removed from the code.
