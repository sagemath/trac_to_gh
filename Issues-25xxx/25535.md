<a id='comment:1'></a>This works:

```
$ wget http://wstein.org/loadtest.py
$ cat loadtest.py 
print "hi from the net"

print 2+3
```

But it does not work from Sage:

```
sage: sage.repl.load.load('http://wstein.org/loadtest.py', globals())
  File "/home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py", line 1
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This allows to understand the problem:

```
sage: !cat /home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<head>
<title>Access denied | wstein.org used Cloudflare to restrict access</title>

But worse is the possibility of the request jost being MITM'd by *anybody* on the network since it is fetched over HTTP. So if you're running the sage doctests in a public wifi, anybody else in that wifi could execute code on your computer.

Possible solutions include
- first downloading the file, then verifying the contents match a hash, then loading it
- just loading a local file

Do we really need to test that we can fetch a file from the internet? Thats more or less a python primitive. And if we need to test that we can and should test it seperately from the `load` mechanism.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I rebased on top of the most recent beta and I added a commit.

There are three issues begin dealt in this ticket:

- `get_remote_file` was broken
- `get_remote_file` was not properly tested (even broken, the doctests were passing)
- `load` was loading a file from the http which is not secure

I believe the proposed two commits solves the above 3 issues (needs review).

Others `urlopen` usage in sage don't seems to display a kind of "Download progress bar" and in my opinion something like "Loading started" and "Loading ended" is enough for the verbose mode. It's still possible to implement a read chunk by chunk if it's really needed.

Either way the remaining `report_hook` function and `cur` global variable should be removed from the code.
