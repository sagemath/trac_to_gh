This works:

```
$ wget http://wstein.org/loadtest.py
$ cat loadtest.py 
print "hi from the net"

print 2+3
```

But it does not work from Sage:

```
sage: sage.repl.load.load('http://wstein.org/loadtest.py', globals())
  File "/home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py", line 1
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This allows to understand the problem:

```
sage: !cat /home/slabbe/.sage/temp/labbe-laptop/25148/tmp_GGzNox.py
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
<head>
<title>Access denied | wstein.org used Cloudflare to restrict access</title>

        <h2 class="cf-subheadline">Access denied</h2>

            <p>The owner of this website (wstein.org) has banned your access based on your browser's signature. ...</p>

The issue that Cloudflare blocks the default python useragent was already encountered at #25222. We have a workaround there as well.

Indeed the wisdom in executing a file fetched from the internet relatively blindly is questionable.

As suggested by nbruin, I added some User-Agent in `get_remote_file`. The problem is that I now use `urlopen` instead of `urlretrieve`. Thus, I can not specify the `report_hook` anymore which was used by the `verbose`.

I set it to `needs_review` to get some feedback by the patchbots.

Indeed, I wanted to say that my first commit was just fixing the doctest with the new url `http://www.sagemath.org/files/loadtest.py`. I am not a specialist on security issues.

But worse is the possibility of the request jost being MITM'd by *anybody* on the network since it is fetched over HTTP. So if you're running the sage doctests in a public wifi, anybody else in that wifi could execute code on your computer.

Possible solutions include
- first downloading the file, then verifying the contents match a hash, then loading it
- just loading a local file

Do we really need to test that we can fetch a file from the internet? Thats more or less a python primitive. And if we need to test that we can and should test it seperately from the `load` mechanism.

I rebased on top of the most recent beta and I added a commit.

There are three issues begin dealt in this ticket:

- `get_remote_file` was broken
- `get_remote_file` was not properly tested (even broken, the doctests were passing)
- `load` was loading a file from the http which is not secure

I believe the proposed two commits solves the above 3 issues (needs review).

There is one small thing that I am still not able to preserve. It is the loading bar of dots `........` as in:

```
sage: get_remote_file('http://www.sagemath.org/files/loadtest.py', verbose=True)
Attempting to load remote file: http://www.sagemath.org/files/loadtest.py
Loading: [.................]    
```

which used to be printed with the help of the `report_hook` which I can not use anymore since I replaced the call to `urlretrieve` by a call to `urlopen`:

```diff
-        urlretrieve(filename, temp_name, report_hook)
+        content = urlopen(req, timeout=1)
+        with open(temp_name, 'w') as f:
+            f.write(content.read())
```

Somebody has a solution? (... one of them being getting rid of the report_hook thing)

yes, this was because of the `urlretrieve` that I am replacing by `urlopen`. I was waiting for an answer to my previous comment before removing the `import urlretrieve`...

Others `urlopen` usage in sage don't seems to display a kind of "Download progress bar" and in my opinion something like "Loading started" and "Loading ended" is enough for the verbose mode. It's still possible to implement a read chunk by chunk if it's really needed.

Either way the remaining `report_hook` function and `cur` global variable should be removed from the code.
