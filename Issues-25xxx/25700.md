In case somebody wonders why the patch is needed:

**With** the Sage patch:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 21 ms, sys: 21 ms, total: 42 ms
Wall time: 243 ms
```

**Without** the Sage patch:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 213 ms, sys: 20 ms, total: 233 ms
Wall time: 432 ms
```

Conda uses pexpect 4.6.0 already and strangely R hangs on the first invocation there. My first thought was that the 4.6.0 upgrade was to blame somehow but since Sage uses an almost unpatched pexpect in this ticket, this seems not to be the case.

It would be great if someone more familiar with pexpect could have a look at https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/issues/19#issuecomment-402557595 and help out with some ideas there.

Sorry for the noise on this ticket (as this is somewhat unrelated.)
