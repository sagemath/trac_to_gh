Currently with_bounds is not implemented on non-facade posets.  This may or not be a good idea, as often one would want the elements in the old poset and the poset with bounds to be comparable, and therefore having `facade=True`, but the current behavior is surprising.

We should either document that with_bounds does not work with non-facade posets, or create an implementation

Trivial PEP8 thing:

```diff
-P = posets.PentagonPoset(facade = False)
+P = posets.PentagonPoset(facade=False)
```
Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
