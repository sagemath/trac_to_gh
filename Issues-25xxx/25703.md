This adds a new `_import_module_from_path` that encapsulates the existing code from this module for searching a directory for a module and importing it, but implements in both Python 2 and Python 3(.4+) compatible ways.

I think in theory this utility could be made public, and moved to a more general module, but I couldn't decide where so I just left it here for now.  Maybe if another use case is found for it...
