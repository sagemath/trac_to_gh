```
Add documentation, tests and/or examples to every method in the ntl library wrappers.

Issues I have found:

- ntl calls lack in several places sig_on/sig_off, this can lead to Sage segfaults. I am adding test for the segfaults I can reproduce with Sage 8.3 (division by zero, changing a polynomial by a negative index).

- int(ntl.GF2X([])) raises a ValueError, it should return 0.

- matrices over GF2, GF2E, IsIdent returns true if a parameter n is negative and the matrix is the identity matrix.

Keywords: days94

<a id='comment:9'></a>A few comments:

- You need to add your (real) name to the authors field.
- `def IsIdent(self, n = None):` -> `def IsIdent(self, n=None):`
- `See `self.__truediv__`` -> `See :meth:`self.__truediv__``

  }}}
  Also should be ```self``.` (same for `degree`).
- Errors should start with a lower case letter (this is a Python convention that is not always followed in Sage).
- (I know this is done elsewhere in the file, but it is wrong) Change

The tests are already there, I even added some where sage does not segfault right now but to check that errors rise. I can add a docstring stating that those are a segfault tests.
