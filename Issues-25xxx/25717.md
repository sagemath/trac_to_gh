```
Add documentation, tests and/or examples to every method in the ntl library wrappers.

Issues I have found:

- ntl calls lack in several places sig_on/sig_off, this can lead to Sage segfaults. I am adding test for the segfaults I can reproduce with Sage 8.3 (division by zero, changing a polynomial by a negative index).

- int(ntl.GF2X([])) raises a ValueError, it should return 0.

- matrices over GF2, GF2E, IsIdent returns true if a parameter n is negative and the matrix is the identity matrix.

The coverage was not bad. I have added some documentations to some methods that lacked one and several examples and test.

There were occasions were sage segfaults, mainly division by zero errors. I hope I have found all. I have added sig_on sig_off and tests in those places.

<a id='comment:9'></a>
A few comments:

- You need to add your (real) name to the authors field.
- `def IsIdent(self, n = None):` -> `def IsIdent(self, n=None):`
- <code>See \`self.__truediv__\`</code> -> <code>See :meth:\`self.__truediv__\`</code>
- `if modulus<=0:` -> `if modulus <= :`
- Bad copy/paste:

  ```
    def __repr__(self):
        """
        Return the degree of self
  ```
  Also should be <code>\`\`self\`\`.</code> (same for `degree`).
- Errors should start with a lower case letter (this is a Python convention that is not always followed in Sage).
- (I know this is done elsewhere in the file, but it is wrong) Change

  ```diff
           INPUT:
   
  -            modulus - a monic `ntl_ZZ_pX` object of degree less than that of `self`.
  +        - ``modulus`` -- a monic ``ntl_ZZ_pX`` object of degree less than that of ``self``
   
           OUTPUT:
   
  -            b - An element such that `self*b==1 mod modulus`.
  +        An element ``b`` such that ``self * b == 1`` mod ``modulus``.
  ```
- Change

  ```diff
  -Only really makes mathematical sense when n divides self.c.p
  +Only really makes mathematical sense when ``n`` divides ``self.c.p``.
  ```
- You should doctest those places where Sage was segfaulting with zero division errors show that Sage now simply raises an error.
