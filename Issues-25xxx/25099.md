Implements #24024 and #23733 for sympow.

This one is a bit of an odd duck, and I left a lot of it alone.  But there were still a few areas where it could benefit from a bit of simplification.

Not sure.

I was not able to locate a home page for the project or an issue tracker.

- The main author is Mark Watkins: http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/
- Sympow binaries (currently Sympow 1.023): http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.bz2
- Doc of [SageMath](SageMath) interface to Sympow: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/lfunctions/sage/lfunctions/sympow.html

SageMath-the-distribution currently ships Sympow 1.018.1, while Debian
has been shipping Sympow 1.023 for a while.
SageMath trac ticket #3360 is about upgrading to Sympow 1.023.

```
The sympow package appears to be a maintained project but without official
 repository; version 1.023 was kindly provided via email by the upstream
 maintainer Mark Watkins <watkins@maths.usyd.edu.au>.
```

embray: Do you mind if I add some clarifications to the `SPKG.txt` about the state of this package or should I put this into a separate ticket?

Sorry, I got that wrong. The following links seem to respectively
get you archives with size and name:

- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow
  -> 50 kB sympow.bz2
- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.src.tar.bz2
  -> 50 kB sympow.src.tar.bz2
- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.tar.bz2
  -> 8.6 MB sympow.tar.bz2

of which the first two are identical although named differently.

I think any discussion about the upstream status of this package is irrelevant to this ticket.  This is just a straight conversion of its `spkg-install` to properly support DESTDIR installation.
