The implementation for the Gauss sum for a character chi does include the value chi(0). This is correct for every character except for the character modulo 1. In this case, the output for the Gauss sum equals zero, but it should be 1.

This issue is fixed by adding the value chi(0) to the Gauss sum.

Component: **modular forms**

Keywords: **Gauss sum trivial character**

Wouldn't instead changing the line below to `for c in chi.values():` by removing the [1:] have the same effect and be neater?

This looks neater, but in the final iteration it computes the product `z *= zeta`, which is not needed. That's why I did not propose this solution.
