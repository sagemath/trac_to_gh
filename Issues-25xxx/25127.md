The implementation for the Gauss sum for a character chi does include the value chi(0). This is correct for every character except for the character modulo 1. In this case, the output for the Gauss sum equals zero, but it should be 1.

This issue is fixed by adding the value chi(0) to the Gauss sum.

Keywords: Gauss sum trivial character
