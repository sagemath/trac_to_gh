I made a few changes in a way I think is more natural by allowing `reduced` to take a string saying what reduced form to construct. If my changes are good, then positive review.

Hi Travis,

thanks for reviewing this. I agree with all your improvements!

It's a good idea to integrate the new functionality into the `reduced`-option (I was thinking to much in types)! Also, the more precise description of the difference of the versions is very helpful.
Finally, thanks for your corrections with respect to formatting conventions. I hope I will learn them soon.
