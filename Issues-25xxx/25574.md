The `_repr_` method for simplicial complexes prints the facets as a `Set`, and so they are not sorted. For consistency with printing (for example, for doctests), let's sort them.

<a id='comment:3'></a>You should have a `try-except` block around the sorting. It is possible that will fail (say, on Python3 trying `[1, 'a']`, where it results in a `TypeError`).

Also, this is overkill:

```diff
facet_string = 'facets {' + '{}'.format(facets)[1:-1] + '}'
facet_string = 'facets {' + repr(facets)[1:-1] + '}'
```
