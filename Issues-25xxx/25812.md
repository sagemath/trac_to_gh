This should have been done in #25139, which modified this package to include a new `spkg-postrm` script that is needed now when rebuilding or upgrading the package in order to properly uninstall it fully.

There's a slight chicken-egg problem that due to the issue fixed in #25732 the upgrade of pkgconf will still not go smoothly, as upgrading the package is required in order to ensure the `spkg-postrm` script is installed properly.  So this should depend on #25732 (with which the upgrade will work).

Perhaps this should be reverted then, if it seems to have caused some problems for people's incremental builds.

I'm not sure why it did, but at the same time this is why I wanted to merge it.  It should have been included in #25139, in which case whatever this issue is might have been caught sooner.

Although I think, actually, the problem some people are having is *because* I forgot to bump the patch level on pkgconf earlier.  If not, there wouldn't have been a problem.
