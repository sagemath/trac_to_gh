I've seen at least one or two people who, rather than use the Jupyter that comes with Sage, have wanted for whatever reason to use a Jupyter Notebook not in Sage to run a Sage kernel (I've seen people ask this for platforms besides Windows as well).

For Windows this turns out to be rather non-trivial: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51308972/982257

We could make this easier in the future by including in the Windows version a kernelspec designed specifically for this purpose, along with instructions for how to install it (e.g. using `jupyter kernelspec install`).
