In #24924 bliss was enabled for computing automorphisms of edge-coloured graphs. The latter is used for `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()` of matrices. For the following matrix `j`, with bliss installed, we have failure, found on #25399, see comment 10 there. Namely

```
sage: j = matrix([(3, 2, 1, 0, 0),
....:  (2, 2, 0, 1, 0),
....:  (1, 0, 3, 0, 2),
....:  (0, 1, 0, 2, 1),
....:  (0, 0, 2, 1, 2)])
sage: j.automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
This is probably due to wrong order of elements in generators produced by the bliss interface:

```
sage: gj=j.as_bipartite_graph()
sage: gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
Permutation Group with generators [(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="sage")
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)(2,5)(6,8)(7,10), (1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)(5,10)]
```

That (10,2) and (10,5) cycles don't look good...

In particular, one can see that the order of elements in cycles is important:

```
age: aa=gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
sage: aa.gens()
[(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: aa.order() # this is correct
4
sage: PermutationGroup(map(Permutation,aa.gens())).order() # nonsense!
960
```
whereas having "sage" instead of "bliss" above gives 4 in both outputs.
Indeed, it's `Permutation()` that does not like wrongly ordered cycles:

```
sage: Permutation(aa.gens()[0]) # 2->10, but 10->4, not 10->2 !!!
[2, 8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4]
```
Perhaps it should be fixed instead, I don't know (but it's a mess, I recall `ncohen` getting really upset about the quality of the code there...).

Okay, so the issue is roughly stemming from the domain being non-standard from the `bliss` group:

```
sage: cycles = [[(10,2), (1,8), (3,6), (4,9), (5,7)], [(10,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9)]]
sage: PermutationGroup(cycles, domain=[10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
Permutation Group with generators [(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: PermutationGroup(cycles, domain=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)(5,10), (1,8)(2,10)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7)]
```
This generates the out-of-order cycles. However, things seem to be generally broken for these permutation group elements:

```
sage: G = gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
sage: G.domain()
{10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
sage: x = G.gens()[0]
sage: x
(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7)
sage: x._gap_list()
[3, 9, 1, 7, 10, 8, 4, 6, 2, 5]
sage: x.domain()
[2, 8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4]
```
So I think there is an implicit assumption that when the domain in `[n]`, it should be sorted.

So in my opinion, `Permutation` is doing the correct thing:

```

```
`Permutation` rightly has a domain of `[1, ..., 10]`, but it is the return trip that is the problem. I think your test in[comment:1](#comment%3A1) is a bit wrong because `PermutationGroup` (also rightly) assumes a domain of `[1, ..., 10]`. However, there is an issue:

```
sage: PermutationGroup(map(list, map(Permutation, G)), domain=G.domain()).order()
4
sage: PermutationGroup(map(Permutation, G), domain=G.domain()).order()
1920
```
in particular `PermutationGroup` is ignoring the domain input when given a list of `Permutation`'s. I am somewhat hesitant to call this a bug given the natural domain of `Permutation` (this also is completely broken for non-standard permutations).

In many ways this is a red herring because `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns` makes the assumption that the domain is `[1, ..., nrows]`. I am tempted to have the bliss `automorphism_group` method sort the vertices of `G` (if able to) before returning the `PermutationGroup`.

Thoughts?

the background is that to respect edge-labels, the implementation by Christian constucts an auxiliary graph, and then cuts out the relevant subdomain action.

Perhaps in the strict sense, but here, we need to know what the identity permutation is. So an domain is an ordered set, i.e., a list, and that ordering defines the identity permutation. So in the example above, `[10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` is the identity.

It is that cut out that assumes the domain/identity is `[1, ..., nrows]`, which is the source of the problem.
