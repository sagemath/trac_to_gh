In #24924 bliss was enabled for computing automorphisms of edge-coloured graphs. The latter is used for `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()` of matrices. For the following matrix `j`, with bliss installed, we have failure, found on #25399, see comment 10 there. Namely

```
sage: j = matrix([(3, 2, 1, 0, 0),
....:  (2, 2, 0, 1, 0),
....:  (1, 0, 3, 0, 2),
....:  (0, 1, 0, 2, 1),
....:  (0, 0, 2, 1, 2)])
sage: j.automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
This is probably due to wrong order of elements in generators produced by the bliss interface:

```
sage: gj=j.as_bipartite_graph()
sage: gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
Permutation Group with generators [(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="sage")
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)(2,5)(6,8)(7,10), (1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)(5,10)]
```

That (10,2) and (10,5) cycles don't look good...

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
In particular, one can see that the order of elements in cycles is important:

```
age: aa=gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
sage: aa.gens()
[(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: aa.order() # this is correct
4
sage: PermutationGroup(map(Permutation,aa.gens())).order() # nonsense!
960
```
whereas having "sage" instead of "bliss" above gives 4 in both outputs.
Indeed, it's `Permutation()` that does not like wrongly ordered cycles:

```
sage: Permutation(aa.gens()[0]) # 2->10, but 10->4, not 10->2 !!!
[2, 8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4]
```
Perhaps it should be fixed instead, I don't know (but it's a mess, I recall `ncohen` getting really upset about the quality of the code there...).

Okay, so the issue is roughly stemming from the domain being non-standard from the `bliss` group:

```
sage: cycles = [[(10,2), (1,8), (3,6), (4,9), (5,7)], [(10,5), (1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9)]]
sage: PermutationGroup(cycles, domain=[10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
Permutation Group with generators [(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7), (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)]
sage: PermutationGroup(cycles, domain=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
Permutation Group with generators [(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)(5,10), (1,8)(2,10)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7)]
```
This generates the out-of-order cycles. However, things seem to be generally broken for these permutation group elements:

```
sage: G = gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
sage: G.domain()
{10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
sage: x = G.gens()[0]
sage: x
(10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7)
sage: x._gap_list()
[3, 9, 1, 7, 10, 8, 4, 6, 2, 5]
sage: x.domain()
[2, 8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4]
```
So I think there is an implicit assumption that when the domain in `[n]`, it should be sorted.

So in my opinion, `Permutation` is doing the correct thing:

```
sage: G = gj.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True,algorithm="bliss")
sage: map(Permutation, G)
[[10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4],
 [2, 8, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 4],
 [7, 3, 5, 1, 4, 2, 8, 10, 6, 9]]
sage: list(G)
[(),
 (10,5)(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9),
 (10,2)(1,8)(3,6)(4,9)(5,7),
 (10,7)(1,3)(2,5)(6,8)]
```
`Permutation` rightly has a domain of `[1, ..., 10]`, but it is the return trip that is the problem. I think your test in [comment:1](#comment%3A1) is a bit wrong because `PermutationGroup` (also rightly) assumes a domain of `[1, ..., 10]`. However, there is an issue:

```
sage: PermutationGroup(map(list, map(Permutation, G)), domain=G.domain()).order()
4
sage: PermutationGroup(map(Permutation, G), domain=G.domain()).order()
1920
```
in particular `PermutationGroup` is ignoring the domain input when given a list of `Permutation`'s. I am somewhat hesitant to call this a bug given the natural domain of `Permutation` (this also is completely broken for non-standard permutations).

In many ways this is a red herring because `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns` makes the assumption that the domain is `[1, ..., nrows]`. I am tempted to have the bliss `automorphism_group` method sort the vertices of `G` (if able to) before returning the `PermutationGroup`.

Thoughts?

this makes no sense to me. How come there is no identify permutation in this list?! At best, what we see here is a coset of the Klein 4-group...

I don't understand. Domains are, mathematically, sets, not lists.

the background is that to respect edge-labels, the implementation by Christian constucts an auxiliary graph, and then cuts out the relevant subdomain action.

It is that cut out that assumes the domain/identity is `[1, ..., nrows]`, which is the source of the problem.
