In #26741 Jeroen mentioned that he might be too busy to work on this full time.

If the stars align properly I will try to be at "Calcul Mathématique Libre" and I would be happy to work on this there but, as I said, I might need some guidance to do so. Would any of the attendees be willing/able to provide it?
