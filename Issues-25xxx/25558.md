In #26741 Jeroen mentioned that he might be too busy to work on this full time.

If the stars align properly I will try to be at "Calcul Mathématique Libre" and I would be happy to work on this there but, as I said, I might need some guidance to do so. Would any of the attendees be willing/able to provide it?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
