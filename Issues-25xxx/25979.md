```
On Python 2:

```
sage: from sage.functions.log import logb
sage: logb(7, 2)
log(7)/log2
sage: logb(int(7), 2)
log(7)/log(2)
```

On Python 3:

```
sage: from sage.functions.log import logb
sage: logb(7, 2)
log(7)/log(2)
sage: logb(int(7), 2)
1
```

This was causing quite a few confusing bugs before I realized the subtle difference of `Integer` vs `int` that was causing the bug.  I'm not sure if it affect other functions too.

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/336 (for pynac)

Though we should also still fix conversion of integer types to expressions on Python 3.

Upstream: **Completely fixed; Fix reported upstream**

Not 100% sure if related, but an interesting difference on Python 2 and 3:

py2:

```
sage: SR.coerce(Integer(7))._dbgprint()
7 (numeric) @0x603ced1f0, hash=0x7, flags=0x7, type MPZ
sage: SR.coerce(int(7))._dbgprint()
7 (numeric) @0x6016ab100, hash=0x7, flags=0x7, type LONG
```

py3:

```
sage: SR.coerce(Integer(7))._dbgprint()
7 (numeric) @0x4ce0820, hash=0x7, flags=0x7, type LONG
sage: SR.coerce(int(7))._dbgprint()
7 (numeric) @0x4ce0820, hash=0x7, flags=0x7, type MPZ
```

I don't think these are the exact same pynac versions either, so it's not clear to me yet where that difference is coming from.

This is originating from `ginac/numeric.cpp`, specifically:

```
void set_from(Type& t, Value& v, long& hash, mpz_t bigint)

                hash = _mpz_pythonhash(v._bigint);

One, perhaps naïve, question I have is why `mpz_fits_sint_p` and not `mpz_fits_slong_p`?
