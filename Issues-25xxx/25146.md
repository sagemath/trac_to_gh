The `AbstractPartitionDiagram` class from diagram_algebra.py inherits from `SetPartitions` and many of the methods will fail if one tries to use them because they assume that the base set is `\{1,2,...,n\}`.

This ticket will factor out the relevant classes from `SetPartition` and have `AbstractPartitionDiagram` inherit only those.

(I somehow doubt it's useful, because typing `max(len(b) for b in S)` is quite brief. On the other hand, it is a very useful invariant.  Besides, `max` takes an iterator, so the brackets can be omitted.)

It's a great ticket, in any case!

<a id='comment:23'></a>We do not need to deprecate it. If you were creating a Brauer diagram by `BrauerDiagram(P, data)` with parent `P`, you were misusing the class. The standard way in Sage to construct an element from a parent is do to `P(data)` (or if you need every last bit of speed, `P.element_class(data)`) so it gets the correct class with the category stuff mixed in. So there should be no code that uses the parent as the first argument. I am -1 on deprecating it; it is a [spacebar](https://xkcd.com/1172/) IMO.
