```
The `AbstractPartitionDiagram` class from diagram_algebra.py inherits from `SetPartitions` and many of the methods will fail if one tries to use them because they assume that the base set is `\{1,2,...,n\}`.

This ticket will factor out the relevant classes from `SetPartition` and have `AbstractPartitionDiagram` inherit only those.

Depends on #24323

Wouldn't `max_block_size` be good to have in the general setpartition class - if needed at all?

(I somehow doubt it's useful, because typing `max(len(b) for b in S)` is quite brief. On the other hand, it is a very useful invariant.  Besides, `max` takes an iterator, so the brackets can be omitted.)

It's a great ticket, in any case!

I removed a lot of essentially duplicate code, did some code simplification (which resulted in a change in the iteration order), and removed the (IMO completely useless) option to pass in a parent to `BrauerDiagram` (if you want it to have a particular parent, construct it the usual way from the parent).

I did do one little thing which might be considered a bit of a hack to remove the need for the `__init__`, but I think the simplified code is useful.

Have been reading carefully your changes, using the code, performed the full tests, and it seems to work well.  Thanks for cleaning that up.

There is a change in the behavior of the element class of `BrauerDiagrams` since `BrauerDiagram(BrauerDiagrams(1), [This is the Trac macro *1,-1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,-1-macro))` is no longer a proper call (I had code which allowed both old and new behavior) and it should now be `BrauerDiagram([This is the Trac macro *1,-1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,-1-macro))` or `BrauerDiagrams(1)([This is the Trac macro *1,-1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,-1-macro))`.
