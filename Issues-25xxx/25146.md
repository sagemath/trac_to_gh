The `AbstractPartitionDiagram` class from diagram_algebra.py inherits from `SetPartitions` and many of the methods will fail if one tries to use them because they assume that the base set is `\{1,2,...,n\}`.

This ticket will factor out the relevant classes from `SetPartition` and have `AbstractPartitionDiagram` inherit only those.

Wouldn't `max_block_size` be good to have in the general setpartition class - if needed at all?

(I somehow doubt it's useful, because typing `max(len(b) for b in S)` is quite brief. On the other hand, it is a very useful invariant.  Besides, `max` takes an iterator, so the brackets can be omitted.)

It's a great ticket, in any case!
