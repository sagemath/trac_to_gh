Try anything from here

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finance/sage/finance/stock.html

that involves grabbing remote stock price data, and it breaks.  It's not surprising, since it depending on a user facing Google service from maybe 2010, and those all go away or change after a while.

Example: https://cocalc.com/share/4a5f0542-5873-4eed-a85c-a18c706e8bcd/support/2018-05-22-091519.ipynb?viewer=share

This is of course an example of doctest breakage, which we don't see, because the tests are "optional -- requires internet!".

`sage.finance` is going to be deprecated (see #32427) and i see no point to maintain a way to fetch stock informations within Sage. Interested people could just `pip install` the corresponding modules.
