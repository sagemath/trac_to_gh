A new option `--gc` is proposed to the Sage doctesting framework. It can be used to control garbage collection as follows:

- `--gc=default`: Python default

- `--gc=always`: run `gc.collect()` before every single test (unless GC was explicitly disabled)

- `--gc=never`: completely disable GC during doctests

I would have found this useful several times for debugging GC-related failures or for more consistent timing of tests.

Note that `--gc=always` causes a few doctest failures

```
sage -t src/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_ambient_jacobian.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/categories/fields.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
but it's not the goal of this ticket to fix these.
