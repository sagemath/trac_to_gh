```
A new option `--gc` is proposed to the Sage doctesting framework. It can be used to control garbage collection as follows:

- `--gc=default`: Python default

- `--gc=always`: run `gc.collect()` before every single test (unless GC was explicitly disabled)

- `--gc=never`: completely disable GC during doctests

I would have found this useful several times for debugging GC-related failures or for more consistent timing of tests.

Note that `--gc=always` causes a few doctest failures

```
sage -t src/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_ambient_jacobian.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/categories/fields.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
but it's not the goal of this ticket to fix these.

One thing I think that is missing is to have this this documented in `sage --advanced`.

Sorry to nitpick, but I think for the `--advanced`, we try to keep it at 70 chars/line, so I would format it as:

```
                           --gc=GC - control garbarge collection (ALWAYS:
                                     collect garbage before every test;
                                     NEVER: disable gc; DEFAULT: Python
                                     default)
```
or possibly

```
                           --gc=GC - control garbarge collection
                                     (ALWAYS: collect garbage before
                                     every test; NEVER: disable gc;
                                     DEFAULT: Python default)
