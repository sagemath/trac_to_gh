Some basic ideal operations are unsupported when `QQbar` is the base field:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQbar[]

sage: I = ideal(x,z)
sage: J = ideal(R(1))
```

Now, both quotient and saturation:

```
sage: I.quotient(J)
sage: I.saturation(J)
```

fail with almost the same error message:

```
TypeError: Cannot call Singular function 'quotient' with ring parameter of type '<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ring.MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain_with_category'>'
```

Singular can perform these operations, but first we have to convert to a NumberField.

```
sage: S.<a> = QQ[]
sage: NFa = NumberField(a^4+1, 'a')

sage: R.<x,y,z> = NFa[]

sage: I = ideal(x,z) 
sage: J = ideal(R(1))

sage: I.quotient(J)
Ideal (z, x) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Number Field in a with defining polynomial a^4 + 1
```

The conversion just needs to be done automatically.

The design to is create a decorator that can be placed on any function that can accept polynomials and/or ideals in a number field.  The decorator will convert from `QQbar` or `AA` into a suitable number field before calling the function's actual code.

In addition to the ideal operations in the ticket description, I've added the new decorator to a number of additional methods (23 in all) where it seemed suitable.

The test case for primary decomposition will fail if #25390 isn't applied, since the `factor_field` option relies on the ability to factor multivariate polynomials.

Decorated methods without the `factor_field` option should work without additional patches.

Most of these decorated methods are surely correct, but I'm not 100% sure about the `factor_field=True` methods.  I don't know if being able to factor the ideal's generators is enough to compute a primary decomposition.

If I understand correctly, you're suggesting caching a polynomial (or ideal)'s conversion in the polynomial (or ideal) object.  The problem is that the conversion usually depends on the other arguments.  For example, if I call `(x+I*y).quo_rem(...)`, then I need to convert `x+I*y` into a `NumberField` that includes `I`, but depending on what  `...` is, that `NumberField` might also need to include additional algebraic numbers.

Some of the ideal methods only depend on the ideal itself, so it would be possible to cache the conversion in that case.

Yes, that's what I meant by “when the only argument that matters is `self`”, sorry for not being clearer. But I guess it is not worth the trouble if you have to use a decorator in any case.

I'm happy with the ticket. Jeroen, do you have anything to add?

I agree that ``@`handle_AA_and_QQbar` is somewhat fragile.  There's no real theory behind it.  It just does what it needs to do for the methods that it's attached to.

There's one method (`transformed_basis`) that it doesn't fully support because the method allows an optional ring to be passed in, and ``@`handle_AA_and_QQbar` doesn't know what to do with that.  I decided to attach the decorator anyway, since the ring argument is optional, and document the `# known bug` in the test suite.

I'm not aware of any kind of `Map` that can take a disjoint union of types as its domain, and do something different with each of them.  Does such a thing exist in Sage?

On the other hand, what's the alternative?  Other than modifying each function individually, I don't really see any.  The decorator works for the functions it's currently attached to.

Fixed.

I've added tests to all of the newly decorated methods.

this is not Python3 safe

```
            elif isinstance(item, list):
                return map(forward_map, item)
```
In Python 3 you have

```
>>> map(str, [1,2,3])
<map object at ...>
```

One way to make it behave similarly on Python2/Python3 is to add on top

```
from six.moves import map
```
and replace the statement with

```
            elif isinstance(item, list):
                return list(map(forward_map, item))

The first thing that the new decorator does is check to see if any of its arguments are polynomials or ideals over the algebraic field, and if not, then call the original function with no changes.

So I don't expect performance regression for existing code.

On the other hand, no explicit check was made for performance.

Have you seen any suspicious performance impact?

Having the wrapper means an extra (python) function call IIRC, then there are all of those imports and the check itself. So I could see this adding up if it was called frequently. Nearly free is not free. `;)` (You also are avoiding short-circuiting by having the list inside of the `any` instead of just the generator.)

I have not seen any performance hit, but for what I have used `MPolynomial_polydict.quo_rem` for, it has not been in a tight loop. So it would not be something noticeable to me without specific testing, which I do below. Ultimately I don't care too much as this fixes a bug, but it does have a bit of a code smell to me.

Here is the results of my timings. On this example, I am getting about a ~10% slowdown on `8.8.rc0`:

```
sage: R = QQ['a','b']['x','y','z']
....: p1 = R('a + (1+2*b)*x*y + (3-a^2)*z')
....: p2 = R('x-1')
sage: %timeit p1.quo_rem(p2)
1000 loops, best of 3: 238 µs per loop
```
vs `8.8.beta7`:

```
sage: %timeit p1.quo_rem(p2)
1000 loops, best of 5: 211 µs per loop
```
For the `CC` example from the doctest there is no change in the timing. My conclusion is it more impactful for fast examples, which is what I expected given the implementation. The question is what is more common, small (fast) `quo_rem` calls or more complex ones.

I tried a caching trick to only call the imports once:

```
if not hasattr(wrapper, 'class_list'):
    from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element import Polynomial
    from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial import MPolynomial
    from sage.rings.ideal import Ideal_generic
    from sage.rings.qqbar import AlgebraicField_common

    wrapper.class_list = (Polynomial, MPolynomial, Ideal_generic)
    wrapper.algebraicfield = AlgebraicField_common

if not any((isinstance(a, wrapper.class_list)
            and isinstance(a.base_ring(), wrapper.algebraicfield) for a in args)):
    return func(*args, **kwds)
```

but it didn't have much impact on performance.  My timings went from an average of 438 to an average of 427.  Average was 402 without the decorator at all.  A decorator that does nothing but call the nested function (no imports or tests) runs in 418.


So, I also get about a 10% slowdown.  Looks like roughly a third of that is function call overhead, a third of it is running the tests, and a third of it is imports.

I don't see any way to avoid running the tests.  We could drop the decorator design to avoid the function call overhead, and cache the imports to avoid that cost.

Unless somebody suggests a better way, I'd be opposed to cluttering up the code like that to achieve a marginal performance gain.
