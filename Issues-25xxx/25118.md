Basically, one test fails on OSX Xeon with Xcode 9.3  (same as on Ubuntu with gcc 5.4),
while a slew of tests fail on OSX i5/7 with Xcode 9.3.

For cdd's header you can pass `-DNOCDDPREFIX` that's one of the things I have learnt from looking at the new spkg at #23353. We probably should depend on it.

```
It's a pointer to an object of type EnumerationFilePrinter handling output.

it's perhaps safe to just delete it, as it is at the end of `main()` member function
of GCats class. (I'll figure it out exactly, anyway, it's a small thing to fix).

If I delete this line then 44 out of 45 tests pass (same as on Ubunty).

This was tried on OSX 10.13.4 on very old Core2 Duo CPU, with clang from XCode 9.3, 
which is `Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)`.

Please, please, try this on i5/i7.

Tried the `multi_polynomial_ideal.py` test again. Success! I checked the other tests (well only one of the .rst, after all they are all copies of the same tests) and they work too.

I am doing full doctesting now in case something broke in the process.
