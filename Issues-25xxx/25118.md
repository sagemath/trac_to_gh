There are also reported Cython testsuite failures, so it might be a compiler issue.

See testing results for the "stand-alone" gfan-6.2 on https://github.com/rwst/gfan06/issues/2

Basically, one test fails on OSX Xeon with Xcode 9.3  (same as on Ubuntu with gcc 5.4),
while a slew of tests fail on OSX i5/7 with Xcode 9.3.

For cdd's header you can pass `-DNOCDDPREFIX` that's one of the things I have learnt from looking at the new spkg at #23353. We probably should depend on it.

The crashes in gfan's 0.6.2 testsuite come from line 208 of app_main.cpp

```
    delete ep;//<--- In next release, make the class virtual
```
It's a pointer to an object of type EnumerationFilePrinter handling output.

it's perhaps safe to just delete it, as it is at the end of `main()` member function
of GCats class. (I'll figure it out exactly, anyway, it's a small thing to fix).

If I delete this line then 44 out of 45 tests pass (same as on Ubunty).

This was tried on OSX 10.13.4 on very old Core2 Duo CPU, with clang from XCode 9.3, 
which is `Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)`.

Please, please, try this on i5/i7.

Nice work Dima. So I took my broken 8.2.rc1. Digged the source for gfan-0.5, found the line in those sources, created a patch and put it in the build tree. Check ed that the `multi_polynomial_ideal.py` test is broken - yup. Rebuild gfan with my patch, gfan do not produces libraries, so there is no need to rebuild sage.

Tried the `multi_polynomial_ideal.py` test again. Success! I checked the other tests (well only one of the .rst, after all they are all copies of the same tests) and they work too.

I am doing full doctesting now in case something broke in the process.

And the patch
