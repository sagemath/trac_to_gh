There seems to be a numerical issues with QQbar elements for _check_satisfies_equations in subschemes. I can't seem to get a direct reproduction, but the issue appears in 

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([16*x^2 - 21*y^2, 16*y^2])
sage: f.automorphism_group()
```
Should be just the identity conjugation.

I'm not totally sure what the right fix is here. It seems that 'touching' the elements causes the numerical issues to go away. The branch has this particular kind of 'fix'. It would be nice to have a better fix for this...

hmm...the original issue definitely appears to be fixed. However, the example I boiled it down to on the sage-devel ticket still does not work, but gives a different error now.

This was fails for enumeration, but it shouldn't be enumerating on a dimension 0 subscheme

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
X=P.subscheme([-7/4*z-w, x-7/4*z, -3/4*x+y-9/16*z+3/4*w])
X.change_ring(QQbar).rational_points()
```

This now also works.

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,3)
X=P.subscheme([-7/4*z-w, x-7/4*z, -3/4*x+y-9/16*z+3/4*w])
X.rational_points()
```

So this ticket requires some more work, but the original issue (and hence the branch) are now outdated.

One more comment...it is still the same issue:

```

Y=X.change_ring(QQbar)
Y(QQbar).points()
```

fails with
