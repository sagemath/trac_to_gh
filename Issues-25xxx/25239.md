There seems to be a numerical issues with QQbar elements for _check_satisfies_equations in subschemes. I can't seem to get a direct reproduction, but the issue appears in 

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([16*x^2 - 21*y^2, 16*y^2])
sage: f.automorphism_group()
```
Should be just the identity conjugation.

hmm...the original issue definitely appears to be fixed. However, the example I boiled it down to on the sage-devel ticket still does not work, but gives a different error now.

This was fails for enumeration, but it shouldn't be enumerating on a dimension 0 subscheme

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
X=P.subscheme([-7/4*z-w, x-7/4*z, -3/4*x+y-9/16*z+3/4*w])
X.change_ring(QQbar).rational_points()
```

This now also works.

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,3)
X=P.subscheme([-7/4*z-w, x-7/4*z, -3/4*x+y-9/16*z+3/4*w])
X.rational_points()
```

So this ticket requires some more work, but the original issue (and hence the branch) are now outdated.
