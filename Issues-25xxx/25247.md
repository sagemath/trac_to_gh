I've mentioned this in a few places before, but there wasn't a ticket for it:

In Python 2, `float.__str__` and `float.__repr__` are different (with only the latter showing 17 significant digits, while the former is arbitrarily truncated to 12:

```python
>>> str(2.0/3)
'0.666666666667'
>>> repr(2.0/3)
'0.6666666666666666'
```

Whereas on Python 3 `float.__str__` and `float.__repr__` are the same (exactly, in all cases):

```python
>>> str(2.0/3)
'0.6666666666666666'
>>> repr(2.0/3)
'0.6666666666666666'
```

For once StackOverflow provides good background: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25899600/982257

In fact the new `float.__repr__` has been backported to Python 2, but it keeps the old `float.__str__`.

A result of this is that in Python 3 any tests where `float.__str__` is used gives different results, and we need to decide how best to handle that difference.

My personal preference would be to wherever possible in Sage (e.g. in `RealDoubleElement` and the like) to always use the `repr()` where it currently uses `str()`.  The [new repr algorithm](https://bugs.python.org/issue1580) is quite a bit nicer.

This would obviously be a backwards-incompatible change in some ways, but would there be much harm?

Fine for me.

It's unlikely to break code, but it might break some doctests (but probably not too much since doctests typically use `repr()` and that will not change).

Just by a quick scan of the current test failures on Python 3 it will actually break a *lot* of doctests in Sage, but that's the point :)

It could also break any doctests in any third-party packages that relying on the `str()` representation of floats anywhere.  It should certainly be documented as a backwards-incompatible change, albeit one that should cause only minor disruption if any.

I think this will actually cover most cases.  It seems there were fewer impacted doctests than I thought, I guess maybe since MPFR is used more pervasively than `RealDoubleElement`.

I'm pretty sure there are some other doctests (e.g. that explicitly call `str()` on some float value) that might need updating, but not many.  I'll check the Python 3 test results and see if there are more I'm missing.
