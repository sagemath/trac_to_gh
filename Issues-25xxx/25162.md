Aside from the natural diagram basis for the Partition Algebra, there is an "orbit basis" which carries representation-theoretic meaning. At present, the Partition Algebra (indeed all diagram algebras) have only the diagram  basis implemented.  This ticket will implement the orbit basis following the model of `PBWBasisOfFreeAlgebra` in `sage.algebras.free_algebra`.

I should mention that I did quite a bit more than implement the orbit basis. I also worked towards implmenting coercion between different instances of SubPartitionAlgebra classes. 

e.g., one would like the following code to work, and it seems like now it does:

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(ZZ, 2)
sage: B2 = BrauerAlgebra(2, q, R)
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(4, q, R)
sage: P(S2.an_element())
3*P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}} + P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
sage: P(B2.an_element())
3*P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1, 2}} + 2*P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, 1}, {-1, 2}} + 2*P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
```

However, I don't understand why coercion from the base ring doesn't work:

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: O2 = PartitionAlgebra(2, q, R).orbit_basis()
sage: P2 = PartitionAlgebra(2, q, R)
sage: O2(P2(13))
13*OP{{-2, -1, 1, 2}} + 13*OP{{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
sage: O2(13)  # this is wrong!!
13*OP{{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
```

(Mike should also check that multiplication in the Orbit basis performs as expected.)

The problem was that `one_basis` was defined in `DiagramAlgebra` and you didn't want that method to exist in the orbit basis.  I don't think it is right for `unital_algebra` to insist that the one of the basis is a single monomial.

That is incorrect, unital algebras does **not** force you to implement `one_basis`. If you have implemented `one_basis`, then it has every right to assume `1` is a basis element. Otherwise you should just implement `one()`.

Some comments:

- Never use a base `except:`; it catches far too much (including things like interrupts, or so I've been told).
- The `module_morphism` is primarily expecting something that takes a basis element as input.
- I have never really liked the (user-level) idiom of `parent.to_foo(x)`, so I removed it. I am good with it being there to avoid reimplementation of boilerplate code, but beyond that, I think only the method at the element level should be exposed to the user.
- I fixed the category issue of `PropogatingIdeal` as effectively a by-product of my refactoring.

There is likely more to be done to improve this file, but this is what is sufficient for the ticket at hand.

Travis,
Your changes look good to me. (Your comments are duly noted.) 

- regarding your third comment...
You removed `to_orbit_basis` from parent `PartitionAlgebra` but left `to_diagram_basis` within parent `OrbitBasis`

- One mathematical quibble/query... 
The orbit basis doesn't exist for many subalgebras of the partition algebra. Well, there could be something best known as 'orbit basis' for each subalgebra, but the formula for converting to diagram basis will not be the same as what appears  around line 2339.

```
        PD = PartitionDiagrams(self._alg._k)
        one = self.base_ring().one()
        return self._from_dict({d: one for d in PD(diag).coarsenings()},
                               coerce=False, remove_zeros=False)
```
I'm not sure what's the best way to address this, but I'd be inclined to keep `PartitionAlgebra` in the name. 

- "Basis" versus "Algebra"...
The new name also doesn't have the word 'algebra' in it, which may be more likely to lead to confusion. Likewise, implementing `DiagramBasis` seems like a good idea, though I'm not sure about the name.

That was one of the first things I touched and a remnant of when I thought it could be necessary/useful. It can be removed.

I don't really care since it is not anything (directly) exposed to the user. I think it is overly verbose to have it in the class name (the docstring differentiates IMO), but feel free to change it back.

(I think this file has gotten so big it is likely more manageable to be separated out into smaller pieces. In which case, `sage.combinat.partition_algebra.OrbitBasis` removes ambiguity, but that is a tangential.)

These are all implemented as algebras in a particular basis. so IMO, there is no distinction between an algebra and a basis. I highly doubt this will cause any serious confusion/problems once someone reads-the-code (if they are looking at these things, they should already be doing that).

It seems really slow.  We might have to implement the multiplication directly on the orbit basis.

There seems to be something wrong here:

```
sage: O = PartitionAlgebra(2,x).orbit_basis()
sage: O[[1,-1],[2],[-2]]
OP{{-2}, {-1, 1}, {2}}
sage: O[[1,-1,2,-2]]

I found a reference for the product on the orbit basis.  See Lemma 4.3 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01410.pdf .
I checked for example that Example 4.5 (2) agrees: 

```
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(4,x);O = P.orbit_basis()
sage: O[[1],[-1],[2,3],[4,-2],[-3,-4]]*O[[1],[2,-2],[3,4],[-1,-3],[-4]]

sage: %timeit O[[1],[-1],[2,3],[4,-2],[-3,-4]]*O[[1],[2,-2],[3,4],[-1,-3],[-4]]

Hmm. This is the sort of thing I've tried to address with my work. See how it works with this alternate construction:

```
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(4,x)
sage: P([[1,-1,2,-2]])
P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, -1, 1, 2}}

sage: P([[-1,-2],[1],[2]])
P{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, -1}, {1}, {2}}
```
So... in the `__getitem__` method, perhaps one could push to `._diag_to_Blst` to solve the problem?

.

sage: P([[1,-1,2,-2],[4]])

sage: P([[-1,-2],[1],[2,3]])
P{{-4}, {-3}, {-2, -1}, {1}, {2, 3}, {4}}

I understand the reason for wanting to pair up for the Brauer algebra, but I don't know if that is particularly natural for the partition algebra or not.  The problem arises if there are an odd number of vertices that are unpaired or if there are not the same number of positive as negative.

The pairing that it tries to do is of the form (+i,-i) for all omitted nodes. If the omitted nodes cannot be so paired, then it brings in everything nodes as singletons.

(So the question about an even or odd number of omitted nodes doesn't quite enter into the story.) 
I note that this even works for putting P_n into P_{n+1/2} story, where one insists that (n+1) and -(n+1) always appear in the same block.

Here is the code, roughly:

```
        nodes = flatten(map(list, d))
        assert max(nodes) <= self._k
        if all([-i in nodes for i in nodes]):
            d = to_set_partition(d, self._k, through_strands=True)
        else:
            d = to_set_partition(d, self._k)
        return self[self._base_diagrams(d)]
```

Where, the optional argument 'through_strands' for the function `to_set_partition` brings omitted nodes in as pairs (i,-i). The default value is `False`.

Thanks for catching my math mistake, Travis. I realized I miscoded the formula as I was walking to the train. 

This wasn't the snag I hit, though. For some reason I couldn't even compose diagrams:

```
sage: P = PartitionAlgebra(3,x); PD = P.basis().keys()
sage: d1 = PD.random_element(); d2 = PD.random_element()
sage: d1.compose(d2)
```
the last line throwing some `TypeError`::

```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-75-c92a56b0f000> in <module>()
----> 1 d1.compose(d2)

/Applications/sage/src/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.py in compose(self, other)
    360         """
    361         (composite_diagram, loops_removed) = set_partition_composition(self._base_diagram, other._base_diagram)
--> 362         return (self.__class__(self.parent(), composite_diagram), loops_removed)
    363 
    364     def propagating_number(self):

/Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.pyx in sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.c:1672)()
    331         else:
    332             # Fast version of type.__call__(cls, *args, **kwds)
--> 333             return (<PyTypeObject*>type).tp_call(cls, args, kwds)
    334 
    335     def __get__(cls, instance, owner):

/Applications/sage/src/sage/combinat/diagram_algebras.py in __init__(self, parent, d)
    240         """
    241         self._base_diagram = tuple(sorted(tuple(sorted(i)) for i in d))
--> 242         super(AbstractPartitionDiagram, self).__init__(parent, self._base_diagram)
    243 
    244     def check(self):

TypeError: super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type
```

It seems to work now, so I don't know what classes I accidentally made `d1` and `d2`. I'll play around a bit more to see if I can reproduce the error.

I think that things left to do here are mostly improvements in the documentation and this embedding thing we started discussing in[comment:25](#comment%3A25) .   Before I make any changes I just want to review what should be the right thing to do.  I think that P_k -> P_{k+1/2} -> P_{k+1} should be the same as P_{k} -> P_{k+1}.  In which case it is appropriate (as you say) to connect k+1 and -k-1 together.

```
sage: P3 = PartitionAlgebra(3,x,prefix='P3'); P4 = PartitionAlgebra(4,x,prefix='P4')
sage: P2(P[[1,-2,2,-1]])
P4{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, -1, 1, 2}}
```
but

```
sage: P3 = PartitionAlgebra(3,x); Px = PartitionAlgebra(7/2,x,prefix='P3.5')
sage: Px(P3[[1,-2,2,-1]])
ValueError: {{-3, 3}, {-2, -1, 1, 2}} does not represent two rows of vertices of order 7/2
sage: Px(P4[[1,-2,2,-1]])
P3.5{{-4, 4}, {-3, 3}, {-2, -1, 1, 2}}
```

so I think that there is something wrong (probably minor).

```

I did

I deleted the "TODO: find a better name?".  `elementary_symmetric` is a fine name and I would not recommend deprecating it now if there was one (and one can always add an alias if a better name comes along).

I added a doctest for `diagram_algebra` because the ones that were there I think must have been copy-pasted.

Otherwise I think this is ready to go.
