Got confirmation from Odile that this patch works.

If possible I'd like to get this in 8.3 actually, but admittedly adding a patch to MPIR is a big rebuild, and it also affects only a few rare machines and has an easy workaround e.g. building MPIR with `--build=skylake` or some other earlier architecture.
