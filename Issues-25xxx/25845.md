This is done mainly to avoid cyclic imports when enabling `binding=True` (#22747).

I'm also removing this pointless implementation of `cardinality()`:

```
    def cardinality(self):
        from sage.rings.integer import Integer
        two = Integer(2)
        if self._type is bool:
            return two
        elif self._type is int:
            import sys
            return two * sys.maxsize + 2
        elif self._type is float:
            return 2 * two**52 * (two**11 - 1) + 3 # all NaN's are the same from Python's point of view
        else:
            # probably
            import sage.rings.infinity
            return sage.rings.infinity.infinity
```
Somebody probably found this clever, but it's just silly... who cares how many different `int` instances there exist? Besides, it's wrong in Python 3.
