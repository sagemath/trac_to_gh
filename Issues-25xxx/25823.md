Maybe it's best if #25636 just tracks the issue with `integrate(x^m/sqrt(a + b*x^(2 - m)), x)`
and the present ticket tracks the issue with `integrate(log(sin(x))*sin(x)^2, x)`.
Unless they come from the same underlying bug in Maxima?

I see you're reporting this example as "reported upstream". I don't think the particular example is there. You could post it as well, either on a separate maxima ticket or on the maxima ticket that is tracking one of these other failing integrals.
