Implements polyhedra over embedded algebraic number fields. 

- Preliminary setup within sage: install e-antic, upgrade normaliz/pynormaliz (see #27682)

- the input is allowed to come from various fields, which will be coerced to a number field first via #20181:

```
        sage: x = polygen(ZZ); P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[sqrt(2)], [AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3))]], backend='normaliz')
```

- See doctests in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py` and `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.py` 

- For debugging help, we can write out Normaliz input files and PyNormaliz function calls as a side effect by passing `verbose=True`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Could someone who has worked on / has opinions on the Polyhedron constructor code help here?

What should we do for polyhedra over AA such as the following:

```
sage: P = polytopes.regular_polygon(3)
sage: P.base_ring()
Algebraic Real Field
```
If `backend=normaliz` is requested, should we cast to the appropriate number field via #20181? Or should it be an error?

To fix this, I had to force install `curl` inside a sage shell. On a debian-sid distribution, it seems that it was not necessary.

Same issue in Ubuntu 16.04LTS, doing `sage -f curl` in a sage shell does not work. Purging curl and reinstalling also didn't work. In order to enable ssl for curl, used the command `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`. After that I no longer have the error `curl: (1) Protocol "https" not supported...`

Thanks for testing. Yes, I think the segfault is coming from somewhere in the interfacing.

> provided the number_field follows immediately after amb_space. 
> (One could think of relaxing this condition.) 

No, I don't think that's necessary -- I just need to fix the normaliz file writer in my sage code to know about this.

<a id='comment:72'></a>I think it would be good to split this ticket into two tickets:
1. Make `backend='normaliz'` accepts input being in a common embedded real number field. That is the following should work

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(2, embedding=AA(2)**(1/2))
sage: Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,a],[0,2*a],[-1,-a]], base_ring=K, backend='normaliz')
```
  And we should also make it so that `backend='normaliz'` is actually automatically chosen if available

```
sage: Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,a],[0,2*a],[-1,-a]], base_ring=K)   # should use normaliz
```
  This would be enough to generate any of the regular polytope examples exactly (including the 600 cells) that could go in the SageMath database `polytopes.`.

Should we actually allow a complex field such as UCF as the base ring of a polyhedron?

Not sure. I remember I was not so happy about allowing real algebraic numbers that have a complex parent into polyhedron: it makes things quite intricate in designing the constructor.

The situation before this ticket was not allowing anything inside of `SymbolicRing` for example, and this would also do the same for `UCF` is the backend field was not given (or perhaps there was an effort to check if one can coerce it in `AA`)... Now, since we accept things that are in the symbolic ring if it is possible to coerce it into an embedded number field... I feel like it would be nice to accept elements of `UCF` if they are real... I remember I had to tweak #20181  so that it would manage to coerce real algebraic numbers even though they are elements of a complex ring.

That said, I would say that the answer should be 'No' (as far as I understand, complex polyhedra are not really well-defined, or are they?). So, this would be an exception to the idea "give back a common parent to the elements given by the user and use it as base ring". I guess the rule should be bound to ultimately "stay real".

So there could be a check to see if the user provided elements from a complex ring (although they are indeed real) and do the appropriate steps to give a real base ring. I do not know how hard implementing this here.
