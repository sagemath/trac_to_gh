```
In the first example, replacing `y` with `a` makes partial fraction decomposition fail:

```
sage: (1/(x+y)/x).partial_fraction()
-1/((x + y)*y) + 1/(x*y)

sage: (1/(a+x)/x).partial_fraction()
1/((a + x)*x)
```
This occurs with any fraction having two variables of that or more negative degree, and the var with lowest degree being lexicographically greater than the others:

```
sage: (1/(c+b)^3/b^3).partial_fraction()
-6/((b + c)*c^5) + 6/(b*c^5) - 3/((b + c)^2*c^4) - 3/(b^2*c^4) - 1/((b + c)^3*c^3) + 1/(b^3*c^3)

sage: (1/(a+b)^3/b^3).partial_fraction()
1/((a + b)^3*b^3)
```
