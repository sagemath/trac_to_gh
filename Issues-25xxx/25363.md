IPython accepts a `--simple-prompt` argument, changing the input handler from `prompt_toolkit` to `raw_input`.

It would be very useful if Sage could pass this argument to IPython,
as it does with `-gthread`, `-qthread`, `-q4thread`, `-wthread` and `-pylab`,
because in Cantor, a front-end program for mathematical packages,
the Sage backend is now broken and that would fix it.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A12):
> How does the Sage backend in Cantor work?  Is it like, pexpect-based or something?  I would suggest that it not be.  Sage is, ultimately, a Python library, so there's no need to use it through Sage's interactive prompt, in order to pass input and receive output.  That said, I have no idea how Cantor's backends work in general.

Now, Sage backend use KPtyProcess. Common in Cantor we use QProcess or C API, but in Sage case we have bash script, which run sage program by using `exac`, and, as I know, QProcess don't work with bash `exac`, so it's just a necessity.

However, `quit()` is no longer enough to close Sage : `emacs` hangs after printing `Process Sage interrompre` two lines below the `Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m12.27s, Wall time 20m30.50s).` message.

Emacs does not hang for me after running `quit()`. I could switch to another buffer, back to the Sage buffer, and run Sage again:

```
sage: quit()
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.47s, Wall time 0m24.00s).

Process Sage finished

This also worked after I turned off my `.emacs` file (the moral equivalent of `emacs -q`). Could something in your emacs setup be interfering?
