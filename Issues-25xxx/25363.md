IPython accepts a `--simple-prompt` argument, changing the input handler from `prompt_toolkit` to `raw_input`.

It would be very useful if Sage could pass this argument to IPython,
as it does with `-gthread`, `-qthread`, `-q4thread`, `-wthread` and `-pylab`,
because in Cantor, a front-end program for mathematical packages,
the Sage backend is now broken and that would fix it.

Now, Sage backend use KPtyProcess. Common in Cantor we use QProcess or C API, but in Sage case we have bash script, which run sage program by using `exac`, and, as I know, QProcess don't work with bash `exac`, so it's just a necessity.

You just have to make sure to pre-parse the input to convert it from Sage's Python syntax superset to pure Python.  The `sage-preparse` script in `src/bin/` demonstrates how Sage does this for entire files, but it can also be done for individual expressions and statements before passing it along to the normal Python interpreter.

I wouldn't go through the `sage` shell script, but rather directly through a Python interpreter.  You just have to make sure to pre-parse the input to convert it from Sage's Python syntax superset to pure Python.  The `sage-preparse` script in `src/bin/` demonstrates how Sage does this for entire files, but it can also be done for individual expressions and statements before passing it along to the normal Python interpreter.  If I have more time later perhaps I can look at the code for the Cantor backend.

This is a little tricky to get just right.  While I believe it's desirable to be able to pass any IPython option on to Sage, we can't easily "pre-parse" those options without digging directly into IPython's command-line parsing.  This will be a bit easier to deal with if/when I redo the `sage` CLI, which does badly need to be modernized.

In the meantime this still has the "correct" behavior, but it causes Sage to "partially" start up (it displays the banner and everything) and then outputs `Unrecognized flag --zzfoobar` preceded by the entire *ipython* help message, which would be confusing to users who don't necessarily understand that ipython is underlying the `sage` CLI.

Let me see if I can do something a bit better in the meantime...

Emacs does not hang for me after running `quit()`. I could switch to another buffer, back to the Sage buffer, and run Sage again:

```
sage: quit()
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.47s, Wall time 0m24.00s).

Process Sage finished

This also worked after I turned off my `.emacs` file (the moral equivalent of `emacs -q`). Could something in your emacs setup be interfering?

I was a tad pessimistic : `emacs` doesn't really hangs, and can be left by `C-x C-c`, without need for `kill`.
