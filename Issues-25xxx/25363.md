IPython accepts a `--simple-prompt` argument, changing the input handler from `prompt_toolkit` to `raw_input`.

It would be very useful if Sage could pass this argument to IPython,
as it does with `-gthread`, `-qthread`, `-q4thread`, `-wthread` and `-pylab`,
because in Cantor, a front-end program for mathematical packages,
the Sage backend is now broken and that would fix it.

Now, Sage backend use KPtyProcess. Common in Cantor we use QProcess or C API, but in Sage case we have bash script, which run sage program by using `exac`, and, as I know, QProcess don't work with bash `exac`, so it's just a necessity.

Both typesetting and plots work (tested in *simple* cases...).

I'm currently scratching my head to figure how to patch `sage-shell-mode` (and possibly `ob-sagemath` to support Sage>9.2.beta8 without loosing support for Sage<=9.2.beta7 (9.2.beta8 itself is a lost cause...). While `ptestlong` runs (and heats the cosmos...).

However, `quit()` is no longer enough to close Sage : `emacs` hangs after printing `Process Sage interrompre` two lines below the `Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m12.27s, Wall time 20m30.50s).` message.

I was a tad pessimistic : `emacs` doesn't really hangs, and can be left by `C-x C-c`, without need for `kill`.
