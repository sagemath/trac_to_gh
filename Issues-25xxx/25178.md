This behavior is confusing

```
sage: SR('I') ** 2   # complex imaginary
-1
sage: SR.var('I')
I
sage: SR('I') ** 2   # now a variable!
I^2
```

So far different solutions are under consideration

1. Let `SR('I')` always return the imaginary unit (and use `SR.var(string)` to create variables)
2. Add `SR.I()` as a method and let `SR(string)` always return a variable
3. Create methods `SR.e()`, `SR.I()`, `SR.pi()` for named constants and let `SR(string)` always create variables.
4. Forbid the names `e`, `I`, `pi`, etc as variable names.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I am not sure if this is really so bad. It is the same for other constants:

```
sage: SR('e').n()   # Euler's constant
2.71828182845905
sage: SR.var('e')   
e
sage: SR('e').n()   # now a variable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
But I can imagine that it would be very useful to use `e` sometimes as a symbolic variable (e.g. when using `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` before..)
