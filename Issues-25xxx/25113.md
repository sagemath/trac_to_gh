Other possibilities - I have `yasm` pre-built, so I don't build it over and over again; as well, I have pre-built autotools, and ran `./bootstrap` before building.

And next to no optional packages, it could be there is some rot there.

Probably we should do everything with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`. I imagine this would show any problem with yasm while testing MPIR.

However, with this setting I get an error while testing `cython`. Perhaps that's where the real problem is --- however I don't know whether this worked before for `cython` on OSX, or there were always errors...

I saw the failures building from a fresh tarball, so I didn't run `./bootstrap` or anything else, just unpacked it and did `make ptestlong`. (I am pretty sure that I also did `make distclean` followed by `make ptestlong` and got the same errors.)

One cannot tell without seeing errors in non-gfan dirs...

Does anyone know how to run gfan's testsuite? It would be a very good idea to do so, also adding spkg-check for gfan would be great...

There seems to be no make targets for this, is it done by some other tool?

<a id='comment:25'></a>
FWIW gfan has a "make check" target but at least on gfan 0.6.2 it also fails with gcc on OSX. 

The fact that this is arch-dependent suggests that it is a bug in the clang optimizer.

In any case, we should just use gcc until this is fixed.

Previous versions of Xcode are available, just don't use the broken one!

After all, it's what we do with gcc, we are not rushing to use the latest greatest, we are fine with gcc 5.4 still, right?

By the way, apparently Apple has been changing contents of their "Command line tools" bundles without bumping up versions, not sure whether it's the 1st accident of this sort, or not.

Namely, on my old laptop I installed Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13) for Xcode 9.3 on the 31st of March, and it had `Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1)` (sic!), giving a broken gfan.
Yesterday I went and installed Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13) for Xcode 9.2 from their website,
and it has `Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)`, which results in OK gfan (with just one test broken, as on Ubuntu).

Could you people please install Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13) for Xcode 9.3 from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ and test? (I presume you will get clang-902.0.39.1 this way).
