Similar to #25349, more debatable since trivial operations with flint polynomials are reasonably fast, but, in my use cases at least, handling these special cases without creating temporary objects is faster.

This is likely common because if you do, e.g., `4/2` instead of `4//2`, you get something in `QQ`. Plus the extra `ZZ` conversion in your new test is unnecessary. I would instead do:\n\n```python\n            if isinstance(right, Integer):\n                if (<Integer> right).is_zero():\n                    raise ZeroDivisionError(\"division by zero\")\n                else:\n                    res = self._new()\n                    sig_on()\n                    fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,\n                            (<Integer> right).value)\n                    sig_off()\n                    return res\n            elif right in ZZ:\n                res = self._new()\n                sig_on()\n                fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,\n                        (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)\n                sig_off()\n                return res\n            else:\n                right = self._parent(right)\n```",

    "user": "https://github.com/tscrim"
}
```

So by my understanding, this test is now stronger than before:

```diff
-            if right in ZZ:
-                sig_on()
-                fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
-                        (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
-                sig_off()
-                return res
-        if self._parent is not right.parent():
-            right = self._parent(right)
-        sig_on()
-        fmpz_poly_div(res.__poly, self.__poly,
-                (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>right).__poly)
-        sig_off()
-        return res
+            if isinstance(right, Integer):
+                if (<Integer> right).is_zero():
+                    raise ZeroDivisionError("division by zero")
+                else:
+                    res = self._new()
+                    sig_on()
+                    fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
+                            (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
+                    sig_off()
+                    return res
+            else:
+                right = self._parent(right)
```
Hence, you get a slowdown:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: %timeit (x^2 + 13*x + 169) // QQ(13)
The slowest run took 86.24 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.97 µs per loop
```
vs 8.3.beta0:

```
sage: %timeit (x^2 + 13*x + 169) // QQ(13)
The slowest run took 174.81 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.06 µs per loop
```
The reason is it converts `QQ -> ZZ['x']` and then does the `floordiv`. This is likely common because if you do, e.g., `4/2` instead of `4//2`, you get something in `QQ`. Plus the extra `ZZ` conversion in your new test is unnecessary. I would instead do:

```python
            if isinstance(right, Integer):
                if (<Integer> right).is_zero():
                    raise ZeroDivisionError("division by zero")
                else:
                    res = self._new()
                    sig_on()
                    fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
                            (<Integer> right).value)
                    sig_off()
                    return res
            elif right in ZZ:
                res = self._new()
                sig_on()
                fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
                        (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
                sig_off()
                return res
            else:
                right = self._parent(right)
```

Indeed. It was intentional (not the Right Way ⇒ no point in making it fast)... but I didn't think of that:

> This is likely common because if you do, e.g., `4/2` instead of `4//2`, you get something in `QQ`.


and I'm open to reverting the change.

> Plus the extra `ZZ` conversion in your new test is unnecessary.


That was an oversight, thanks!
