The current behavior is so that the center of the ball is set positive

```
sage: RBF(0.0, 0.1).abs().endpoints()
(-0.100000000093133, 0.100000000093133)
```
It is annoying if we want to use the result as input for a function with domain [0, infinity).

The function `above_abs` and `below_abs` are close to what should be used in this context (but they are not returning balls).

Ask Fredrik! But taking the absolute value of the center and leaving the radius untouched looks very reasonable to me...

Use `above_abs()`.
