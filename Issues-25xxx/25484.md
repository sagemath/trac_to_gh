The current behavior is so that the center of the ball is set positive

```
sage: RBF(0.0, 0.1).abs().endpoints()
(-0.100000000093133, 0.100000000093133)
```
It is annoying if we want to use the result as input for a function with domain [0, infinity).

The function `above_abs` and `below_abs` are close to what should be used in this context (but they are not returning balls).

What is wrong here? That's a correct result!

And:

```
~/docs/vrac/c$ cat arb_abs.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <arb.h>

int main(void) {
    arb_t a;
    arb_init(a);
    arb_set_str(a, "0.0 +/- 0.1", 53);
    arb_print(a); putchar('\n');
    arb_abs(a, a);
    arb_print(a); putchar('\n');
    arb_clear(a);
    exit(0);
}
~/docs/vrac/c$ gcc arb_abs.c -lflint-arb && ./a.out
(0) +/- (858993461 * 2^-33)
(0) +/- (858993461 * 2^-33)
```

Ask Fredrik! But taking the absolute value of the center and leaving the radius untouched looks very reasonable to me...

> In the extreme case presented in the ticket description, the radius can be divided by 2... and the behavior is annoying if you have to compute e.g. L1-norm.


Use `above_abs()`.

Yes they are.
