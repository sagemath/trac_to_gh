The function `MutablePoset.map` is a bit unrobust when many of the shell elements are mapped to `None` simultaneously. This situation occurs, for example, when calling

```
sage: asymptotic_expansions.InverseFunctionAnalysis('n', phi=lambda u: 1/(1-u), precision=10)
```

As a result, this call randomly (depending on the order in which elements are deleted from the `MutablePoset` in the background) fails with a `KeyError`.
