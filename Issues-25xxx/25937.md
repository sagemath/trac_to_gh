I would not have `level` take an optional `weight` in the `IntegrableRepresentation`. Weights already know about their level:

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weights()
sage: (La[2]+La[0]).level()
2
sage: al = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).root_lattice().simple_roots()
sage: al[1].level()
0
sage: La = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).ambient_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: La[1].level()
1

Since I cannot check out the branch, I cannot make these trivial changes. But here are some more typos:

- othrwise -> otherwise in the section "Untwisted Affine Kac-Moody Lie Algebras"
- I would use `\ldots` rather than `\cdots` in lists
- `alpha_1` should be `\alpha_1` in the section "Twisted Types"
- spce -> space in the section "Roots and Weights"
- The following sentence "(For the twisted cases, see [Kac]" seems unfinished or a bracket is missing.
- The link ~sage.combinat.root_system.extended_affine_weyl_group seems broken.

<a id='comment:34'>Comment 34:</a>
Work issues:

Anne and Travis have some comments that need to be addressed. I'll try to do those now.

Should the section on affine crystals have any references back to this section? Specifically I discuss the question of extended versus not extended root lattice.

We had discussed adding material about Kac and BKK crystals in a new section. That could be another ticket or it could be part of this one. 

I have trouble making the backward link to the reference manual on extended affine Weyl groups work at the very end of affine.rst. S similar link to the reference manual for IntegrableRepresentation class works fine.

<a id='comment:37'>Comment 37:</a>
Here are some corrections of typos and comments on "Integrable Highest..."

---

second paragraph: weight decomposition --> weight space decomposition

--The support of an integrable highest weight representation

first and second paragraphs: Both \Lambda and \lambda are used. We need to choose one. For consistency, \Lambda is better. 

third paragraph: a increasing sequence --> an increasing sequence

---Modular Forms

first paragraph: weakly modular form --> weakly holomorphic modular form

I think that "weakly holomorphic" is more commonly used.

first paragraph: weakly modular means --> weakly holomorphic means

third paragraph: weakly modular form --> weakly holomorphic modular form

third paragraph:  the number of positive roots of $\mathfrak g^\circ$ -->  the number of positive roots plus half the rank of $\mathfrak g^\circ$

---Sage methods for integrable representations

first paragraph: highest weight Lie algebras --> highest weight representations

second paragraph: two dominant multiple weights --> two dominant maximal weights

second paragraph: Since $s_0$ fixes $2 \Lambda_1 -\delta$, it is not a good example. The following Sage code does not show the action of the Weyl group element. It may be a good idea to remove the part "We apply...the corresponding dominant maximal weight" as this point will be illustrated in the next paragraph.

fourth paragraph: Again, the choice of $s_0$ is not good. Any other choice will work.

sixth paragraph: the parentheses in the denominator of the first product is broken.

sixth paragraph: the factor $q^{-1/8}$ --> the factor $q^{1/8}$

seventh(?) paragraph: The infinite sums in the parentheses for the string functions need to begin $1$ instead of $q$.

seventh(?) paragraph: both weakly modular forms --> both weakly holomorphic modular forms

seventh(?) paragraph: two is als a weakly modular form--> two is also a weakly holomorphic modular form

A period is missing after [KimLeeOh2017].

Thank you again Dan for your work on this and improving Sage's documentation/tutorials as a learning resource.

I have made a bunch of small changes in the tutorials. Most of them are small formatting changes and typo fixes, but for a few of my changes, I added a little more detail or did some rewording.

I am happy with the current state.

There is a similar link to the reference manual for the IntegrableRepresentation class and that works.

--The support of an integrable highest weight representation


first paragraph: $L(\lambda)$ --> $L(\Lambda)$ (There are two occurrences of this.)


---Sage methods for integrable representations

first paragraph: A period is missing at the end of the last sentence.

second paragraph: The sentence "Then we compute the string function at this weight, which we see agrees with the string function for the corresponding dominant maximal weight:" seems out of place. Could we delete it?

A period is missing at the end of the displayed math in the sentence begin with "Reading what the OEIS..." 

The formulas of two string functions are not adequately aligned.
