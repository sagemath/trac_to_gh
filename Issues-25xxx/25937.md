Anne and Travis have some comments that need to be addressed. I'll try to do those now.

Should the section on affine crystals have any references back to this section? Specifically I discuss the question of extended versus not extended root lattice.

We had discussed adding material about Kac and BKK crystals in a new section. That could be another ticket or it could be part of this one. 

I have trouble making the backward link to the reference manual on extended affine Weyl groups work at the very end of affine.rst. S similar link to the reference manual for IntegrableRepresentation class works fine.

<a id='comment:37'></a>Here are some corrections of typos and comments on "Integrable Highest..."

---

second paragraph: weight decomposition --> weight space decomposition

--The support of an integrable highest weight representation

first and second paragraphs: Both \Lambda and \lambda are used. We need to choose one. For consistency, \Lambda is better. 

third paragraph: a increasing sequence --> an increasing sequence

---Modular Forms

first paragraph: weakly modular form --> weakly holomorphic modular form

I think that "weakly holomorphic" is more commonly used.

first paragraph: weakly modular means --> weakly holomorphic means

third paragraph: weakly modular form --> weakly holomorphic modular form

third paragraph:  the number of positive roots of $\mathfrak g^\circ$ -->  the number of positive roots plus half the rank of $\mathfrak g^\circ$

---Sage methods for integrable representations

first paragraph: highest weight Lie algebras --> highest weight representations

second paragraph: two dominant multiple weights --> two dominant maximal weights

second paragraph: Since $s_0$ fixes $2 \Lambda_1 -\delta$, it is not a good example. The following Sage code does not show the action of the Weyl group element. It may be a good idea to remove the part "We apply...the corresponding dominant maximal weight" as this point will be illustrated in the next paragraph.

fourth paragraph: Again, the choice of $s_0$ is not good. Any other choice will work.

sixth paragraph: the parentheses in the denominator of the first product is broken.

sixth paragraph: the factor $q^{-1/8}$ --> the factor $q^{1/8}$

seventh(?) paragraph: The infinite sums in the parentheses for the string functions need to begin $1$ instead of $q$.

seventh(?) paragraph: both weakly modular forms --> both weakly holomorphic modular forms

seventh(?) paragraph: two is als a weakly modular form--> two is also a weakly holomorphic modular form

A period is missing after [KimLeeOh2017].

--The support of an integrable highest weight representation


first paragraph: $L(\lambda)$ --> $L(\Lambda)$ (There are two occurrences of this.)


---Sage methods for integrable representations

first paragraph: A period is missing at the end of the last sentence.

second paragraph: The sentence "Then we compute the string function at this weight, which we see agrees with the string function for the corresponding dominant maximal weight:" seems out of place. Could we delete it?

A period is missing at the end of the displayed math in the sentence begin with "Reading what the OEIS..." 

The formulas of two string functions are not adequately aligned.
