This ticket is the logical continuation of #25164

It implements various calculus methods on pseudo-riemannian submanifolds (for example: normal vector, first/second fundamental form, gauss/principal/mean curvature...).

Some methods are also used exclusively in the case a foliation is provided (shift, lapse, ...).

Using these functions, one can for example easily perform n+1 decomposition of any tensorfield.

This is part of the â€‹[SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/); see the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

<a id='comment:8'></a>This is a nice enhancement regarding differential geometry!

The code is carefully written and documented. 
The main issue is the long time of some doctests, for instance:

```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/pseudo_riemannian_submanifold.py", 
line 156, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.pseudo_riemannian_submanifold
Warning, slow doctest:
    N.extrinsic_curvature()[:] # long time
Test ran for 462.97 s
```
This is far too long for a single doctest. On my computer, there are 7 doctests with a time above 50 s. This increases too much the total time for doctesting all Sage library. Probably the solution would be to decrease the dimensionality of your examples, i.e. consider hypersurfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional manifold instead of a 4-dimensional one. 

Another remark: the documentation generated for the method `ambient_extrinsic_curvature` appears to be that of the decorator ``@`cached_method`, because of the alias

```
ambient_extrinsic_curvature = cached_method(ambient_second_fundamental_form)
```
in line 974 of `pseudo_riemannian_submanifold.py`. Same issue for `extrinsic_curvature`, `induced_metric`, `ambient_induced_metric`.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I went from 4D Minkowsky to 3D Minkowsky in the first example, which resulted in a total test time of about 4 minutes on my laptop:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 247.5 seconds
    cpu time: 269.6 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 247.4 seconds

```

Further reducing this time would mean further reducing the dimension, but 1D foliation of 2D manifold are not very interesting.
