```
var('n')
solve(abs(-(8*n+1)+(-11*n-1)*3+(8*n-2)*(-2)-30*n)/sqrt((8*n+1)^2+(11*n+1)^2+(8*n-2)^2)==sqrt(29), n)
```
does not find solutions (which are n==1 and n==-1/2), but the very similar

```
var('m')
solve(abs(-(8+m)+(-11-m)*3+(8-2*m)*(-2)-30)/sqrt((8+m)^2+(11+m)^2+(8-2*m)^2)==sqrt(29), m)
```
works just fine.
