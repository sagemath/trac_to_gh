Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):
> `--root` implies `--single-version-externally-managed`


What I'm not sure about here (I haven't tried it) is if `--root=""` (e.g. if `$SAGE_DESTDIR`) were empty.  What I do know in that case is that if defaults `/`, but I don't know if it still automatically implies `--single-version-blah`.  I'd say it *should* but I don't know.  I think it's fine just to keep it.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A10):
> If you're changing `pip` anyway, would it make sense to upgrade to 9.0.3 while you're at it?


Yeah, the thought did cross my mind.  Might as well.
