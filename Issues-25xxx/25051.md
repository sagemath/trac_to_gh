`--root` implies `--single-version-externally-managed`:

```python
    def finalize_options(self):
        orig.install.finalize_options(self)
        if self.root:
            self.single_version_externally_managed = True
        elif self.single_version_externally_managed:
            if not self.root and not self.record:
                raise DistutilsArgError(
                    "You must specify --record or --root when building system"
                    " packages"
                )
```

Maybe you want to keep `--single-version-externally-managed` for clarity, but there is no need to.

> `--root` implies `--single-version-externally-managed`

What I'm not sure about here (I haven't tried it) is if `--root=""` (e.g. if `$SAGE_DESTDIR`) were empty.  What I do know in that case is that if defaults `/`, but I don't know if it still automatically implies `--single-version-blah`.  I'd say it *should* but I don't know.  I think it's fine just to keep it.

Yeah, the thought did cross my mind.  Might as well.
