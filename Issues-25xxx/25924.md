An isoform congruence is uniform; a uniform congruence is regular. It is fast to check if a congruence is uniform. Hence it makes sense to use it as a short-circuit in `is_isoform` and `is_regular`. Also trivial congruences should not be tested.

I timed this with list of all lattices of exactly ten elements. Before

```
sum(1 for L in Lats if L.is_regular())
sum(1 for L in Lats if L.is_isoform())
```

took 60 and 40 seconds. After this those take 32 and 27 seconds.

(More to come after #25895 is closed.)

Possibly a better change could be

```sage
            x = iter(cong.root_to_elements_dict().values())
            ell = len(next(x))
            if all(len(p) == ell for p in x):
```
This avoids the extra `len` and `[]` calls (granted, these are so very small to really matter) and is Python3 compatible (or maybe use the `six` itervalues?).

As you wish. Modification suggested by Travis does not make measurable difference in timings.

Actually we should think if every *principal* congruence is regular|uniform|isoform, is then the whole lattice regular|uniform|isoform? If so, it would greatly reduce computation time. I have not found a counter-example, but neither have a proof for that.

Also, we for example know that a relatively complemented lattice is isoform. Can that be used to found a non-isoform congruence without checking all of them?

I am not surprised, it is a micro-optimization at best.

Sounds like something to think about and implement (if true) in a follow-up ticket. :)
