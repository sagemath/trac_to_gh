Given a list of labeled real-valued vectors and a significance level `alpha`, generate a graph with vertices corresponding to the list's labels where two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding vectors have a correlation coefficient that is positive or negative at the specified significance level. An object creating the graph should support the `plot` method, which will plot the generated graph using a circular layout.
