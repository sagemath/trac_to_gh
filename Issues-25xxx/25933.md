Given a list of labeled real-valued vectors and a significance level `alpha`, generate a graph with vertices corresponding to the list's labels where two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding vectors have a correlation coefficient that is positive or negative at the specified significance level. An object creating the graph should support the `plot` method, which will plot the generated graph using a circular layout.

I've made a very bare-bones start on this but please tear it apart.

One note about my plot() implementation - the graph.plot function invokes the constructor at `.__class__()` about 10 methods deep (specifically, at the start of `GenericGraph._subgraph_by_adding`).

In the plot method I've put in a hack that works around it, 

```
def plot(self):

    self.__class__=Graph
    p=self.plot()
    self.__class__=CorrelationGraph

    return p
```


but I think this is a symptom of a larger issue. Making assumptions about the arguments of the class constructor of a passed object feels like poor design, and we should be able to inherit the plot method with any class, without restrictions on the shape of said class' constructor.

If anyone can find a better workaround please let me know, this is the tidiest one I've found.
