As was discussed in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/9BhrS2J4oE8 these two packages have been optional for over a year. They provide useful methods for braids and links.

In the future, I'd appreciate if you could cross-post such a vote to sage-packaging. No accusation, just a friendly request :)

I now have to package these two libraries for nix. Questions:

- where is the source for libbraiding 1.0 coming from? I'm assuming its from https://github.com/miguelmarco/libbraiding/, but I don't see any tagged 1.0 release or a linked distribution tarball there.
- why are we using this fork instead of any other? The jeanluct has more recent commits for example. Since you're apparently the author I'm sure you have good reasons, but you should document them.

Ok, I will try to remember that the next time.

Yes, the source is taken from the github repo (I know the correct way to do would be to create a release... Add it to my to-do list)

> - why are we using this fork instead of any other? The jeanluct has more recent commits for example. Since you're apparently the author I'm sure you have good reasons, but you should document them.

jeanluct's repo contains a command line program (braiding). libbraiding is not a command line program, but a library that exposes the functions to be used by other programs.

Ah okay, makes sense. I think you should add that explanation to the README sentence where you mention its a fork.

Could you please do that soon? Just add a 1.0 tag to github. Shouldn't take more than a minute. Its not very nice to package something without an offical source.

I created the release in github. However, the tarball that you will get there does not coincide with the one in the sage repo, since the later is constructed from the former by autotools.
