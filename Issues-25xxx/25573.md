Perhaps the person who wrote that code (albeit way back in 2007) should chime in.  It does appear to be incomplete.  You get the same result if you pass `allow_subfield=False, check_rank=False`.

Isn't this pointing out a "bug" in `coprime_integers`?

```
        if n == 1:
            X = [0]
        else:
            X = n.coprime_integers(n)
```
I wonder whether it would be more useful to return `[0]` in `1.coprime_integers(1)`...
