After #25162, it seems that the content of `partition_algebra.py` is no longer needed, but when looking for partition algebras, one may be misled that this is what's implemented (also because of http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.html)

It is not clear to me whether we can simply remove this, or whether the classes should be deprecated, or somehow recycled.

For example:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
sage: da.PartitionDiagrams(3/2)
Partition diagrams of order 3/2
sage: _.list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2)
Set partitions of {1, ..., 2, -1, ..., -2} with 2 and -2 in the same block
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2).list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
```

<a id='comment:3'></a>Do we need to keep/deprecate the classes

```
class SetPartitionsXkElement(SetPartition):
```
and

```
class SetPartitionsAk_k(SetPartitions_set):
class SetPartitionsAkhalf_k(SetPartitions_set):
```
etc., and

```
class PartitionAlgebraElement_generic(CombinatorialAlgebraElement):
class PartitionAlgebraElement_ak(PartitionAlgebraElement_generic):
```
etc.?

They do not appear in any doctests, and look rather "private".

I want to add the doctests all to `diagram_algebras.py` though, because they are quite good!
