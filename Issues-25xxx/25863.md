Currently, the implementation of the Greene-Nijenhuis-Wilf "hook-walk" algorithm for generating random standard Young tableaux is inefficient as it takes more steps than necessary.

In `sage.combinat.tableau.StandardTableaux_shape.random_element`, the code creating the array `hooks` has two off-by-one errors that result in the addition of two copies of `cell` to `hooks`. It should not contain `cell` at all.

Keywords: combinatorics, tableaux

<a id='comment:1'></a>I've also taken the liberty of fixing a comment and deleting some extra whitespace in this function.

I wasn't sure how to write a test but would be happy to try to implement one if anyone has any ideas.
