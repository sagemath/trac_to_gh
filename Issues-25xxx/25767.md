It's best to change the line in `checksums.ini` to take account of this, I think.

IMHO it's rather some crap happening on the server of USNA, not on trac.

In fact, I tried modifying as I proposed:

```

and it works, so there is no harm in using the URL without `-`.
If you can get it in then it's positive review. :-)
