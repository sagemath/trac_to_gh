Jeroen, would you accept this change that you refused here (in another ticket):

```patch
-        P = sum([arrow2d((0,0), (cos(x*0.1),sin(x*0.1)), hue=x/(20*pi)) for x in range(0,20*pi+1)])
+        P = sum([arrow2d((0,0), (cos(x*0.1),sin(x*0.1)), hue=x/(20*pi)) for x in range(floor(20*pi)+1)])
```
It seems to me that there is no issue in sage, only the fact that python3 is more strict on what it accepts inside range.

That's not precisely the change that I rejected. You changed `20*pi` by `63` originally in multiple places.

Anyway, let me figure out exactly what `range()` accepts on Python 2 and Python 3 and then I'll comment back.

I agree. Python 2 essentially replaces `range(foo)` by `range(int(foo))`. Python 3 requires an integer as argument to `range()`.
