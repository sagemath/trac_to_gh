-Sage was not built with SAGE_DEBUG but this wasn't necessary before, either.
+
+The reason is that SAGE_DEBUG is not "no" here, it's simply empty, so the check for "no" in \`bin/sage\` fails and "yes" is assumed. The workaround thus is to set SAGE_DEBUG explicitly.
+
+Now why is this suddenly surfacing?

I think compiler and debugger are orthogonal, i.e., you should be able to use lldb on gcc compiled programs. Right now I'm using gdb on clang compiled Sage / Pynac.
