```
The aim of this ticket is to allow Sage to use the system's `R`, instead of building its own.

It should work for:
- `sage -R` command
- Sage's `r` interface
- Sage's `rpy2` Python package
- Sage's jupyter `IRkernel`

Similarly to the way one can decide to use the system ATLAS when building Sage,
on the user side, building Sage so that it uses the system R is achieved by setting
the `SAGE_R_LIB` environment variable.

To test this ticket, you should at least:

- install `R` on your system (e.g. `sudo apt install r-base`)
- reinstall `r` and `rpy2` with `SAGE_R_LIB` set:

```
export SAGE_R_LIB=/usr/lib/R/
sage -f r
sage -f rpy2
make build
```
- test Sage `R` command (this should/might show a different version than 3.4.4):

```
sage -R
```
- test Sage's `R` interface:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/r.py
```
- test `rpy2`:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/stats/r.py
```

It is up to the user to decide whether she wants to use the system's R or Sage's R, the default remains to build and use Sage's R.

I think that any installation of Sage which does not install its own R, Python, Singular, etc., should not have functioning `sage --python`, `sage -R`, `sage --singular`, etc., commands. Maybe instead, those commands should provide good error messages if Sage is configured to use a system version of the appropriate software.

But if you really want `sage -R` to work with a non-Sage version of `R`, please change the documentation.

I never changed those help messages in sage-on-gentoo. There is an ambiguity I am exploiting. You think it only means R from sage the distribution, I take it to mean R that sage has been configured to use. You could argue that the capitalisation means we are talking about the distribution.

Should we have a semantic war :)

In any case, while there is no real benefit, compared to running R directly, I don't see why the behavior shouldn't be preserved. Existing scripts shouldn't break because you changed some underlying bits.

I think that if the system has `R` installed, people should run it by running `R`, not `sage -R`. So I think if Sage is going to use the system's `R`, there is no need for command `sage -R` – it adds the 6 extra characters `sage -` for no reason – and it should be disabled.
