<a id='comment:10'></a>Could you update the ticket description?

In the methods `openers` and `closers`, why do you sort? (Note that you do not use these methods except in doctests in which you sort again)

Rook placement corresponds to position in a matrix. It is very unconvenient to have them start at 1...

What does the following has to do with the ticket!?

```
+        sage: from sage.combinat.q_analogues import q_int
+        sage: q = ZZ['q'].gen(); h = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).h()
+        sage: n = 6;
+        sage: s = lambda k: {"x%s"%i: q_int(i+1) for i in range(k)}
+        sage: all(q_stirling_number2(n,k) == q^binomial(k,2)*h[n-k].expand(k, s(k).keys()).subs(**s(k)) for k in range(1,n))
+        True
```

Instead of things like `r = next(i for i,j in rooks if c == j)` you would better convert a rook placement into a dictionary `j -> i`.

In `from_rook_placement_gamma`, you would better use `set` rather than `list` and use the method `discard` for removing element.

I think of these as convenience methods for the user, so sorting seemed appropriate to me.  I wouldn't use them in library code, because there is little to be gained. In the doctest I have to sort again, because I am adding other elements.

I won't insist: I can remove the sorting, too.

This is something I actually thought about for quite some time, with no really good conclusion.  There are several ways to turn a set partition into a rook placement, the most common is to take the set of arcs.  Most but not all papers think of a rook placement corresponding to a set partition as an upper triangular matrix, so that's the convention I followed.

The entries of the set partitions in sage are {1,...,n}, so I would have to subtract 1 from each entry.  Are you sure that this is more convenient in the end?  I think most of the time the user is going to convert from arc-like things, but I don't know.  I think `from_arcs` is convenient, should I simply add another method `from_rook_placement_arcs`, which is zero-based?

I followed all your other comments and found them very good!

The constructor of set partitions does not promise this property. I am not sure it is worth assuming it and then getting into trouble in 10 years from now because someone changed the implementation (or factored this code out into a category).

<a id='comment:29'></a>Maybe yes, into `__init__`. I do think it should be clarified *somewhere* whether or not `__iter__` promises anything about the order of the iterator.

This sorting is also assumed elsewhere, such as

```
def standard_form(self):
    return [sorted(_) for _ in self]
```
which only makes sense if self is sorted already.

Since this sorting is also used in other places, would you add a promise into the `__init__` so that everyone can rely on it ?
