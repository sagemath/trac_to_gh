normalize coordinate should remove the gcd from the coefficients when it is possible to do so. However, it does not always remove enough:

```
sage: K.<w> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([w*x^2 + (1/5*w)*y^2, w*y^2])
sage: f.normalize_coordinates();f
```
fails to have the common 'w' removed. Part of the issue appear to be the gcd for maximal orders are returned as number field elements instead of maximal order elements

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 7)
sage: R = K.maximal_order()
sage: R(a).gcd(R(2*a)).parent()
```

We found 2 minor errors (see below) where the output of the example differs by a minus sign. Otherwise everything else looked great!

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([-4*y^2, 9*x^2 - 12*x*y])
sage: f.reduced_form()
```

```
sage: K.<w> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([w*x^2 + (1/5*w)*y^2, w*y^2])
sage: f.normalize_coordinates();f
```
