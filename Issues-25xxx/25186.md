The switches the random number generation in `random_prime` to use `ZZ.random_element` instead of Python's `random.randint`.

The original motivation is that this gives consistent results between Python 2 and Python 3 (whose `randint` implementations have slight differences).  The results should be the same insofar as providing a uniform distribution, though someone with better knowledge may want to check that the tests still make sense as written.

Unsurprisingly, however, this gives `random_prime` a speedup of roughly 5 times (at least on my system).
