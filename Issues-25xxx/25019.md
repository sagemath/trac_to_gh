Dividing by zero in AA or QQbar is currently allowed and can lead to terrible arithmetic inconsistency such as

```
sage: a = QQbar(I).real()
sage: b = ~a
sage: (a*b).is_zero()
True
```
We had check for nonzero denominator in divisions.

---
Original report:

Sometimes dividing by zero in `AA` results in returning an object which prints as

```
[-infinity .. +infinity]
```
Other times the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.

I am not sure what the "[-infinity .. +infinity]" object is and as far as I can tell there are no methods in `AA` to test for it, so my feeling is that this return is erroneous. I believe that dividing by zero should always be handled in a consistent way, which it is not as the following example illustrates:

```
sage: z = QQbar(I).real()
sage: z
0
sage: ~z  # or 1/z
[-infinity .. +infinity]
sage: z == 0  # or z.is_zero()
True
sage: ~z  # or 1/z
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: rational division by zero
```

The above example clearly indicates that simply testing the value of variables in `AA` (which you would naively guess has no effect on their internal state) changes the outcome of division (by zero). Reminds me of quantum mechanics...

I think this is a significant issue because people unaware of the possibility of a `[-infinity .. +infinity]` return will not test for it.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

There is a lazyness mechanism of the computations in `QQbar`, which does not compute (costly) exactifications unless it is required to save time, see for example:

```
sage: a = QQbar(2)
sage: b = a.sqrt()
sage: b
1.414213562373095?
sage: b^2
2.000000000000000?
sage: b^2 < 4       # this is fast because Sage does not need exactifying b^2 for deciding
True
sage: b^2
2.000000000000000?
sage: b^2 == 2      # this exact computation requires exactification, of course the better internal representation is kept for further computations
True
sage: b^2
```

I admit that in your case, an error is delayed, but i guess that in a "true" computation process, the error will happen anyway later. Exactifying to catch such error on-time might slow down every `QQbar` computation.

In case a division is performed, we must check for nonzeroness. Otherwise, we can easily end up with inconsistent results if automatic simplification happen later.
