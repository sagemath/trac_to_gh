When passing an iterator/generator of polynomials to `PolynomialSequence`, the first element of the iterator gets lost if one also passes the ambient ring.

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence import PolynomialSequence
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: PolynomialSequence(iter(R.gens())) # correct
[x, y, z]
sage: PolynomialSequence(iter(R.gens()), R) # wrong
[y, z]
sage: PolynomialSequence(iter([(x,y), (z,)]), R) # wrong
[z]
```
The documentation for `PolynomialSequence` states that the argument must be an iterable object, so it should support iterators. Indeed, they work correctly if one does not pass the ambient ring: This case requires iterating the elements twice in order to determine the ring, so the implementation first creates a list.

Interestingly, the documentation for (not necessarily polynomial) `Sequence` states that the elements must be a list or a tuple. Should it maybe be updated to handle iterators, as well?
