The `SBox` class defines three methods (`difference_distribution_matrix`, `linear_approximation_matrix` and `boomerang_connectivity_matrix`) that are typically called `..._table` in the literature.

IMO we should adjust these names (and correctly deprecate the old names, of course).

So far looks good to me. There is only one thing left. The documentation of  `crypto/mq/sr.py` mentioned `difference_distribution_matrix`. I think that too needs to be replaced.
