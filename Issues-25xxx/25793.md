After this ticket, we can do

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: M = matrix(P, 2, [-9*x^2-2*x+2, x-1, x^2+8*x, -3*x^2+5])
sage: fricas(M)                                                     # optional - fricas

```
which allows for easier access of some of FriCAS' functionality.

+After this ticket, we can do
 
+```
+sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
+sage: M = matrix(P, 2, [-9*x^2-2*x+2, x-1, x^2+8*x, -3*x^2+5])
