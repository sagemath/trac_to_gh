<a id='comment:4'></a>I've run a few tests on this and haven't come up with anything that does not work correctly.

However, I'd like to know what prompted the addition of ArithmeticError to the gcd check in dehomomgenize for affine morphisms.

It is likely that whatever this is will also occur in normalize_coordinates for projective morphisms.

Actually, with on a branch that contains contain and my other tickets currently waiting for review, it now works for me (that is, the gcd is computed)! I don't know not sure what changed fixed the issue.
