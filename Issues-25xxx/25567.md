Did you report that upstream?

I analyzed the problem and the problem happens because the output of `isprime(p, 1)` changed from returning a primality certificate to a boolean answer. There is now a separate function `primecert()` for getting a certificate.

The test directly checks the PARI interface, but otherwise these primality certificates are not used by anything in giac. So while the test fails, nothing else in giac should fail because of this.

The only contact info I found was that [forum](https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/) and I'm still waiting for my account to be approved. I think I accidentally chose the wrong option at the age question (doesn't help that the forum is in french). I sent an email to the administrators, no reply yet.

If you want to try, maybe you have more luck. I wish they'd just use some issue tracker or plain old email.

More generally, their website is a mess... Even finding the source tarballs is hard. And that page has `debian` in its name even though these are just the sources: https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/

I just recall now that `@`frederichan is a Giac developer and usually all bug reports from Sage go through him. ​Frederic: if you missed the discussion, the upgrade to PARI/GP breaks one test from Giac:

Just a general reply:

- look at the diff and see whether it makes sense.
- Sage cares a lot about tests, so check whether the code is well tested.
- check the patchbot (the colored blob at the top of the page).
- maybe try a few examples, test corner cases in the code.
- if all is well: set the ticket to positive_review and add your real name as Reviewer on the Trac page. At that point, the release manager will merge the ticket in some later beta/rc release (assuming that all dependencies are merged).

In this case, this is a package upgrade, which is a bit different. The patchbot doesn't test it, so somebody should manually run the full Sage testsuite. If you want to take my word for it, I did that and tests passed.

Regarding the testsuite, although many files have my name I didn't wrote them for a testsuite so they are often too sensitive. But I think (this was often the case in the past) that bernard prefers to keep many examples and look if the changes are bugs or not. In this particular example, there are not so many giac functions that can't be run without pari (ex: ifactor still works in giac without pari), so I guess that bernard will keep this test.

For a sage package where you always have pari you may decide to suppress it.

NB: if you plan to upgrade giac package, 1.4.6.69 is not enough to fix #25822 but the next stable should be.

Did that. While I won't pretend all the math, the changes look very reasonable to me. No obviously wrong results and I think we can trust pari with the details.

Two things that stuck out to me though:

```
sage: a.multiplicative_order()
-        4547473508864641189575195312
+        189478062869360049565633138
```

```
             sage: O3.absolute_discriminant()
-            8643600
+            400160824478095086350656915693814563600
```

I would've thought that both the multiplicative order and the absolute discriminant are supposed to be unique. But again, my knowledge is limited.

check

Oh, I've always wondered what exactly the patchbot is everybody is talking about.

But can anybody just do that?

Why doesn't the patchbot test package upgrades? I think if we can just take anybody's word for it, its probably yours.

For now I just did `echo > check/chk_fhan11`. Its not that easy to disable an individual test.

The multiplicative order is certainly unique, but the *element* `a` that we're taking the order of is different.

In the second case, I changed the test input because PARI got more clever in computing orders. We need the large primes `1000003` and `1000099` to make it more difficult for PARI to accidentally find the maximal order.

It's what Sage uses for continuous integration. It's far from perfect and there is a proposal to replace it: #24854

Yes, anybody can do that. This process seems to be working fine.

So if you create that file with the following contents:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"<insert path to local build of gp here>/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nsage should pick up your gp since it is first in PATH.\n\n>   2.

Some of the new mf* functions crash on 2.11.0 but run fine with the current development commit.  What I am currently doing is building this development gp executable outside Sage and manually changing the link  SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gp to point to that.  (My code is only using gp.eval(), not Pari library functions.

sage sets its `PATH` in `sage-env`. After setting that it sources `~/.sage/sagerc` if available. So if you create that file with the following contents:

```
export PATH="<insert path to local build of gp here>/bin:$PATH"
```

sage should pick up your gp since it is first in PATH.

I don't think that is a good idea. Development versions are not for "production" use. Instead you could ask upstream for a release or suggest to them to release bugfixes in point releases.

In that case the current solution or one through #24919 is probably best.

Yes that is true. But if there is something upstream we need, we should at least ask them for a release before deciding to just fetch some unstable commit.

We can ask, but it probably won't happen just because we ask.

All that is hypothetical in the case that pari adds important features that we need in sage and they refuse to make a release including them in reasonable time. As far as I understand, that is not the case yet.

It's not the case yet, but judging from past experiences, this is likely to happen.
