The attached picture shows how many modules (horizontal) you can run in how many CPU minutes (vertical). So, for example, in 40 CPU minutes (i.e., 10 wall minutes on my laptop) I can run all the doctests in 80% of all Sage modules. In 4 CPU minutes, I can doctest 50% of all Sage modules.

[This is the Trac macro *Image* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (bar.png,width=80%,center))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#Image-macro)

This ticket implements a `--short [SECONDS]` switch which runs as many doctests as possible (from the top of each module) in SECONDS (default 300).

This gives us a quick way to check that a change did not break things too terribly. For example, when I work on p-adics, I would probably do: `sage -tp --short 30 src/sage/rings/padics` frequently. Once I am happy with my changes, I could do `sage -tp --short src/sage/rings`  and a final `sage -tp --short --all` before I leave the rest to the patchbot.

Here is an example:

```

I have a first prototype now. If I set it to try to finish in 30s walltime and run on `src/sage/rings/padics`, it does skip tests in only 4 files (here reported as failures at the moment):

```
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py  # 125 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py  # 303 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_extension_leaves.py  # 72 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx  # 172 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 35.8 seconds
```

As an extreme example, if let it test everything in `src/` in two minutes, it manages to finish within four minutes (because it does not actually abort any doctest line once it started) and runs 314607 docstring lines and skips 361692, so it skips roughly 50%.

I've seen some cases before where the expected output was accidentally left off a doctest, and the doctest runner just ignored that, seemingly buggily, whereas fixing/changing things in the doctest runner made it start expecting output again.  Could this be something like that?

I think it's a legitimate regression, unlike my earlier guess.  The failure is here:

```
        The only-errors mode does not output anything on success::

            sage: DD = DocTestDefaults(only_errors=True)
            sage: FDS = FileDocTestSource(filename, DD)
            sage: DC = DocTestController(DD, [filename])
            sage: DTR = DocTestReporter(DC)
            sage: doctests, extras = FDS.create_doctests(globals())
            sage: runner = SageDocTestRunner(SageOutputChecker(), verbose=False, sage_options=DD, optionflags=doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS)
            sage: Timer().start().stop().annotate(runner)
            sage: D = DictAsObject({'err':None})
            sage: runner.update_results(D)
            0
            sage: DTR.report(FDS, False, 0, (sum([len(t.examples) for t in doctests]), D), "Good tests")

        However, failures are still output in the errors-only mode::

            sage: runner.failures = 1
            sage: runner.update_results(D)
            1
            sage: DTR.report(FDS, False, 0, (sum([len(t.examples) for t in doctests]), D), "Failed test")
                [... tests, 1 failure, ... s]

```

The intent of the test is that nothing should be output by `DocTestRunner.report` if it's in "only-errors mode" (a thing I didn't know existed), and there are no failures.

Strange, though, since looking at `sage.doctest.forker` all doctests are supposed to be compiled as though `from __future__ import print_function` was present.  Maybe, somehow, just including the required compile flags isn't enough to ensure that the `print()` function is in the globals?
