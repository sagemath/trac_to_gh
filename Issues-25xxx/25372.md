I as asked to prepare a build of this that can be dropped into an installation of the Windows version of Sage.

In order to do this it's best to add DESTDIR support to the build so that it's easy to generate a file manifest (also, being an experimental package, it's even more important that uninstall work for it as well).

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/pull/490

Keywords: destdir cryptominisat

Branch/Commit: 312f1eb4a52174e352f8b6ac2866ce14067126f0

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Reviewer: Julian Rüth

Author: Erik Bray

Resolution: fixed
