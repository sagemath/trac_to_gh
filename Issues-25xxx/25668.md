Running Sage for the first time after installing from binary under
Linux or macOS leads to running `relocate-once.py`.

Before this ticket, when run by Python 3 (eg as installed by Anaconda),
it would lead to the following error.

```
$ ./sage
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded during compilation
************************************************************************
It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.
************************************************************************
```
which seems to come from Python3 choking on a very long line in
`relocate-once.py`, because of the Python3 bug described as
[Python issue 32758](https://bugs.python.org/issue32758).

See reports by Sage users at

- https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42736/linux-binary-seems-to-be-source/
- https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42562/recursionerror-when-installing-sagemath-82/
- https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35132/how-do-i-solve-this-installation-problem/

Reported in "upstream" binary-pkg at [binary-pkg issue 16](https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/issues/16) -- see the fix there.

After that fix, relocate-once.py can run with Python 3, and this ticket adds
error-checking after running relocate-once.py, with a meaningful error
in case of failure.

The tentative solution at one point was to make `relocate-once.py` be run
with Sage's Python2, whence the now-inaccurate ticket summary.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
According to "j.c." on ask.sagemath.org, the solution to installing a binary with Ananconda installed is:

```
On the off-chance you're using Anaconda, try commenting out the export 
PATH="/anaconda/bin:$PATH" line in the .bash_profile file (and restarting 
your terminal) before you run Sage for the first time.

You can uncomment it again after sage successfully runs (until you have 
to rebuild or upgrade Sage).
```

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
First, I think we should catch an error if `relocate-once.py` does not run successfully, and in particular that's when the message about Anaconda should be printed. 

Second, there are several problems in `relocate-once.py`:
- Related to anaconda and/or Python 3: the `RecursionError` comes from the line starting

```
p('local/lib/libflint-13.5.2.dylib').patch(1552, 1684)...
```
 That line is 61957 characters long (!), and I wonder if its length is causing problems. Certainly if I delete just that line, I no longer get the `RecursionError`.
- related to Python 3, if I delete the aforementioned line, I get

```
Rewriting paths for your new installation directory
===================================================

This might take a few minutes but only has to be done once.

You mean, there should be an error handler there?

Searching the web for [ "maximum recursion depth exceeded during compilation" ]
yields many results, including the following one not related to Sage:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/3zusdy/eval_python_beginner/

It might indicate that the error has something to do with a call to `eval`(?).

This other result shows that the error can occur even just running `sage --version`:

Maybe I was wrong about this: Sage's Python 3 is now giving this error on a similar file: `[1,2,3]` with `.sort()` appended 1500 times – not good Python, but enough methods to give Python 3 problems. Not Python 2, though.

Clunky but I think it's the best solution. I would probably skip the `python2.6` check though.

Do we already know why things go wrong with Anaconda?

It seems to me that either Python 3 in general, or Anaconda's Python 3, doesn't like lines with too many attributes/methods. Even without that line, the script is not compatible with Python 3.

That's a good idea, let's do that. This branch works for me.

If this really works, then positive review. But you have to convince me that you tested it properly.

First, I'm relying on this assumption: `relocate-once.py` will only be present in binary releases (and therefore `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python2` exists). I tested by downloading a binary release. I also downloaded Anaconda and let it modify my path (when you install, at least on OS X, it writes to `$HOME/.profile`). So I had this:

```
$ echo $PATH
/Users/palmieri/anaconda3/bin:....
$ which python
/Users/palmieri/anaconda3/bin/python
$ python --version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```
Then running `./sage` from the binary distribution works:

```
$ ./sage

Rewriting paths for your new installation directory
===================================================

This might take a few minutes but only has to be done once.

patching ...

```

I also took a binary distribution and broke `relocate-once.py`. The result of running `./sage`:

```
$ ./sage
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/BDIST/SageMath/relocate-once.py", line 9
    print('hello")
                 ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
Error running the script 'relocate-once.py'.
```
Note that I didn't actually build a binary distribution, I just patched the file `SAGE_ROOT/sage` by hand.

The error message if I run `./sage` from a freshly unpacked source tarball of course remains the same (since `relocate-once.py` does not exist, the if block is not executed).

What else would you like me to check?
