Few Minor bugs fixes for `q_analogues.q_subgroups_of_abelian_group`:
* Counting how many trivial subgroups there are (i.e. 1) was missing, and raised an exception.
* The `algorithm="delsarte"` did not use floor division, so the parent is a fraction field instead of a polynomial ring.

In addition, some better support for non-Sage elements, like it is done in q_binomial, using `parent(X)` instead of `X.parent()`.
