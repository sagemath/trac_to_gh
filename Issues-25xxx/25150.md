As discussed on #25056, that ticket introduced a small, but annoying runtime dependency on a file that lives in `$SAGE_ROOT`, `VERSION.txt`, which creates problems for downstream distributions.

This proposes to eliminate practically all dependence on `VERSION.txt`, by instead writing the same string to a new variable `SAGE_VERSION_BANNER` which is stored in both `src/bin/sage-version.sh` and `src/sage/version.py`.  Although mildly redundant, this is at least consistent.

Originally I thought to just outright remove `VERSION.txt` since at this point it is not used directly anywhere in sagelib or sage-the-distribution. However, there are probably various external utilities that look for that file--I can confirm that the patchbot is one such utility, if nothing else.  But there are likely others.  So it's harmless to keep it.

I'll leave it to Volker to decide on the blocker status.

The reason for my "git feeling" is that tickets touching the build system have a tendency to introduce subtle breakage. And this isn't a simple bug-fix either, it's really adding new functionality.

Our existing implementation is far from ideal, but I also don't see a real improvement in this patch.

The way it should be is: there is a version py and sh file, for import/source in python and shell scripts. There shouldn't be python scripts looking at environment variables that where set elsewhere.

There should be some mechanism to check that `SAGE_ROOT` is not being used outside of the build system so this doesn't happen again, and that is not in the attached branch.

The only "mention of `SAGE_ROOT`" is as an alternative "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh" if it does not exist.

I agree that's not a great place for that file, but it's where it already existed.  I don't know what you do with it on gentoo (though having it there isn't the worst place for it).

+1 to all of the above in principle.  However, you'll see in this branch that it actually eliminates several uses of `$SAGE_ROOT`, and leaves only one in the `sage` script, and only as a fallback if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh` does not exist yet.  I agree that's still not ideal, but also somewhat necessary since currently the `sage` script serves as an entrypoint to runtime capabilities of Sage, and to the "build system" (a fact I've complained about in #25130).

The goal there was that at the very least, running `./sage --version` should work the same whether in a fresh clone of the repository (though that's actually already broken at the moment for unrelated reasons), or running some binary release with no `$SAGE_ROOT`.

@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 As discussed on #25056, that ticket introduced a small, but annoying runtime dependency on a file that lives in `$SAGE_ROOT`, `VERSION.txt`, which creates problems for downstream distributions.
 
-This proposes to eliminate practically all dependence on `VERSION.txt`, by instead writing the same string to a new variable `SAGE_VERSION_FULL` which is stored in both `src/bin/sage-version.sh` and `src/sage/version.py`.  Although mildly redundant, this is at least consistent.
+This proposes to eliminate practically all dependence on `VERSION.txt`, by instead writing the same string to a new variable `SAGE_VERSION_BANNER` which is stored in both `src/bin/sage-version.sh` and `src/sage/version.py`.  Although mildly redundant, this is at least consistent.
 
 Originally I thought to just outright remove `VERSION.txt` since at this point it is not used directly anywhere in sagelib or sage-the-distribution. However, there are probably various external utilities that look for that file--I can confirm that the patchbot is one such utility, if nothing else.  But there are likely others.  So it's harmless to keep it.

Rebased.  I still believe this to be better than the current situation, though I would welcome concrete feedback and/or criticism.

Depending on how you read the diff, I didn't move it at all :)  At least, in terms of intent, what I was moving was:

```
if [ "$1" = '-dumpversion' -o "$1" = '--dumpversion' ]; then
        sage_version
        exit 0
fi

if [ "$1" = '-v' -o "$1" = '-version' -o "$1" = '--version' ]; then
        sage_version -v
        exit 0
fi

if [ "$1" = '-root'  -o "$1" = '--root' ]; then
    echo "$SAGE_ROOT"
    exit 0
fi

if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
  if [ "$1" = '-h' -o "$1" = '-?' -o "$1" = '-help' -o "$1" = '--help' ]; then
     usage
  fi
  if [ "$1" = "-advanced" -o "$1" = "--advanced" ]; then
     usage_advanced
  fi
fi
```

which I felt should work even from a clean source checkout.  Previously these flags did not work in that case because sourcing sage-env would not work correctly.  In other words, from a clean source checkout you can now do:

`./sage --version`

`./sage --root`

and so on.
