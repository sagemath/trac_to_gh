As discussed on #25056, that ticket introduced a small, but annoying runtime dependency on a file that lives in `$SAGE_ROOT`, `VERSION.txt`, which creates problems for downstream distributions.

This proposes to eliminate practically all dependence on `VERSION.txt`, by instead writing the same string to a new variable `SAGE_VERSION_BANNER` which is stored in both `src/bin/sage-version.sh` and `src/sage/version.py`.  Although mildly redundant, this is at least consistent.

Originally I thought to just outright remove `VERSION.txt` since at this point it is not used directly anywhere in sagelib or sage-the-distribution. However, there are probably various external utilities that look for that file--I can confirm that the patchbot is one such utility, if nothing else.  But there are likely others.  So it's harmless to keep it.

The only "mention of `SAGE_ROOT`" is as an alternative "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh" if it does not exist.

I agree that's not a great place for that file, but it's where it already existed.  I don't know what you do with it on gentoo (though having it there isn't the worst place for it).  I think I would rather do away with `sage-version.sh` and instead put that info in `sage-env-config`, but I was trying to keep this change as undisruptive as possible.

Which is why, while I'm sorry to make a fight over this, I just feel like it's a little unfair to unilaterally brush it off without due consideration, especially since it was only to address a legitimate complaint of a regression for downstream packagers.

+1 to all of the above in principle.  However, you'll see in this branch that it actually eliminates several uses of `$SAGE_ROOT`, and leaves only one in the `sage` script, and only as a fallback if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-version.sh` does not exist yet.  I agree that's still not ideal, but also somewhat necessary since currently the `sage` script serves as an entrypoint to runtime capabilities of Sage, and to the "build system" (a fact I've complained about in #25130).

The goal there was that at the very least, running `./sage --version` should work the same whether in a fresh clone of the repository (though that's actually already broken at the moment for unrelated reasons), or running some binary release with no `$SAGE_ROOT`.
