The current implementation of `central_orthogonal_idempotents` is inherited from `FiniteDimensionalSemisimpleAlgebrasWithBasis`. The combinatorial formula in terms of standard tableaux is much faster (implemented as the method `cpis`).

This ticket does two/four things:

* replaces the default implementation of `central_orthogonal_idempotent/s` with one based on the code in `cpi/s`;

* fixes a bug in `cpi/s`, which assumes base ring contains `QQ`;

* implements primitive central orthogonal idempotents in any characteristic, using Nakayama's Conjecture; 

* adds a `deprecated_function_alias` for the nondescriptive `cpi/s` methods.

The current implementation (develop branch) comes from `FiniteDimensionalSemisimpleAlgebrasWithBasis` and is quite slow. E.g.,

```
sage: %time z = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 5).central_orthogonal_idempotents()
CPU times: user 3.04 s, sys: 65.8 ms, total: 3.11 s
Wall time: 3.11 s
```

On this branch's ticket, the method `central_orthogonal_idempotents` just points to `cpis`, which is much faster:

```
sage: %time z = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 5).central_orthogonal_idempotents()
CPU times: user 177 ms, sys: 38.4 ms, total: 215 ms
Wall time: 608 ms
```

The test in the file is no longer actually testing the method there. So you need a different semisimple finite-dimensional algebra with a (distinguished) basis.

Also, for consistency (and speed), you should return a `tuple` for `cpis` and make it an `@cached_method`.

You will need some form of a mathematical test, but the easiest way is:

```
sage: S3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: S3 in Algebras.Semisimple
True
sage: S3p = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(GF(3), 3)
sage: S3p in Algebras.Semisimple
False
```

That is way too difficult and complicated. Just raise a `ValueError` when it is not semisimple in `cpis`.

> What is the correct way to check for semisimplicity?
> 

An algebra is **semisimple** if the Jacobson radical of the algebra is trivial, and an element x in R is in the **Jacobson radical** of R if 1 + RxR is a unit, or rx is right quasi-regular for all r in R (rx is **right quasi-regular** if there exists an element z in R such that rx + z + rxz = 0).

If R has an identity element, then rx is right quasi-regular if and only if 1 + rx has a right inverse in R. 

Here is an alternative way to check for semisimplicity:

```
sage: S3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,3)
sage: S3.radical()
sage: S3.radical_basis()
()
sage: S3p = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(GF(3), 3)
sage: S3p.radical()
sage: S3p.radical_basis()
([1, 2, 3] + 2*[3, 1, 2],
 [1, 3, 2] + 2*[3, 2, 1],
 [2, 1, 3] + 2*[3, 2, 1],
 [2, 3, 1] + 2*[3, 1, 2])
```

That's right. I was speaking less about "how best" rather than "how".

I don't know how the semisimplicity check gets done...

I don't declare the axiom "Semisimple" at any point when I run

```
sage: S3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
```
versus

```
sage: S3mod = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(GF(3), 3)
```
yet somehow Sage knows it. 

When I browse through the `combinat.symmetric_group_algebra.py` file, I don't see any mention of semisimple. (Nor in the `algebras.group_algebra.py` file, for that matter.) Yet---in the development branch, at least---the method `.central_orthogonal_idempotents` is not made available to the user for `S3mod` but it is made available for `S3`.

I've made two more changes that I'd like an experienced contributor to chime-in on:

*Change No.1/*

The method `.cpis` was not cached. Okay, but probably it should be, since `.central_orthogonal_idempotents` was and we're replacing it. However, `.cpis` simply calls `.cpi` for each partition of _n_. It seems more natural to cache these.

That way, when the user wants to study specht modules of hook-shape, or some such (i.e., not ever calling `.cpis`), then s/he would not have to repeat expensive computations.

**Problem:** `.cpi` is happy to receive a list as argument (instead of a proper Partition). But you cannot add `@cached_method` in this case. So, do I:

* cache individual idempotents to be friendly to Professor Hook-Shape, or
* allow lists as inputs to be friendly to Professor Hook-Shape?

*Change No.2/*

The `.cpi` code was incorrect, creating expressions with coefficients in `QQ` even if the group algebra was defined over `GF(3)`. 
I have added a check that denominators are not zero, and separately coerced the coefficients into `self.base_ring()`. (Note that some idempotents are well-defined even when the ring is not semisimple, so this seems like a better solution than just disallowing use of `.cpi` in these cases.)

In addition, there is the distinction between:
- Is -- mathematically speaking -- the algebra semisimple?
- Does Sage know that the algebra is semi-simple?

Travis' suggestion is about the latter, and this is was we want in such situations: based on the current knowledge which algorithm is it best to use.

> I don't know how the semisimplicity check gets done...

The relevant statement is that the algebra of a finite group is semisimple if the characteristic does not divide the order of the group, right? This is thus implemented in Groups.Finite.Algebra. And since one needs to have information about the order of the group, this goes in
`Groups.Finite.Algebra.ParentMethods.__init_extra__` which is called on any group algebra of a finite group upon it's initialization.

This is polluting a bit the `__init__` method though. Also we would want to deprecate `cpis` as well.

One day, we really should have this `@conditionally_defined` attribute.

For now, I would:

- make `cpi` a `deprecated_function_alias`
- raise a ValueError at the beginning of `central_orthogonal_idempotents` if the group algebra is not semisimple

Agreed: deprecating both cpis and cpi, while renaming the later to something relevant;
maybe a name xxx that suggests how it is constructed, which makes it meaningful even
when the algebra is not semisimple.

`central_orthogonal_idempotents` could then return a `LazyFamily(Partitions(n), self.xxx)` in the semi-simple case.

This is because a finite group algebra can quickly check Maschke's theorem, which is done in the `finite_groups.py` (look for the `Algebras` category's `extra_super_categories`). (Group algebras is too generic as it doesn't special case when it comes from a finite group.)

The main result to absorb to understand the changes I've made is 

__Murphy (J. Alg., 1983), Theorem 2.8__, which gives a constructive proof of Nakayama's Conjecture.

<a id='comment:30'>Comment 30:</a>
Some comments:

- Why are you not displaying all 3 idempotents in the test you changed in `categories/finite_dimensional_semisimple_algebras_with_basis.py`?
- You don't need to say `central_orthogonal_idempotents` overrides a generic implementation (if you insist on linking to that, then you should link to the explicit method).
- In `central_orthogonal_idempotent`, `core` will all be in math mode. I think you should just use `c(\lambda)`.
- To better follow conventions:

  ```
        INPUT:

        - ``la`` -- a partition of ``self.n`` or a
          ``self.base_ring().characteristic()``-core of such
          a partition

        - ``block`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); when ``False``,
          this returns the classical idempotent associated to ``la``
          (defined over `\QQ`)

        OUTPUT:

        If ``block=False`` and the corresponding coefficients are
        not defined over ``self.base_ring()``, then return ``None``.
        Otherwise return an element of ``self``.
  ```
- You can remove the <code>(taking \`\`block=False\`\`)</code> part as it is clear from the example.
- I think your error message is better written as

  ```
  raise ValueError("the {1}-core of {0} is not a {1}-core of a partition of {2}".format(la, p, self.n))
  ```
  I don't see the benefit of showing the user `mu`.
- The `cpi = sum()` should not be in the `try-except` block. Similarly for calling `self._blocks_dictionary()`. That way you are less likely to catch errors that should be propagating up.
- Better to use `_Partitions` instead of `Partitions()` as the former is already an instance.
- In the same vein, you probably can just use `_Partitions` as the cache key for `cpi_over_QQ`.
- Avoid calling `keys()` when you can just iterate over the `dict`.
- Why are you using `gap` and not `libgap` here:

  ```
  eval(gap.eval("Display(Irr(SymmetricGroup(%d)));"%n))
  ```
  Also, why are you sending it through `eval` and not using the `.sage()` of the GAP objects? Actually, why not just use `SymmetricGroup(n).character_table()`?
- `cpi_over_QQ` is a function, not a method, so you should use `@cached_function`.
- The error message in `cpi_over_QQ` says it should be a partition of 4, which doesn't seem correct.
- You don't need the list of all partitions to get the index. Just get the cardinality `C` and run `{la: C-1-i for i,la in enumerate(Partitions(n))}`.

Hi Travis,

Most of your suggestions/questions seem reasonable. I'll get to them soon.

Let me focus here on the gap stuff:

I didn't write these lines of code. They are hold-overs from the original `.cpi` method. I'm guessing you expect a speedup from doing things differently? I'm a novice when it comes to interacting with gap. (Stay tuned, there might be a call for help on the horizon.)

Using `libgap` will definitely be a speedup as it doesn't have to go through a pexpect interface (i.e., convert to/from strings), but it also is cleaner code. Perhaps a better way would be to directly call libgap to avoid more intermediate objects:

```
sage: [c.sage() for c in libgap.Irr(libgap.SymmetricGroup(4))]
[[1, -1, 1, 1, -1],
 [3, -1, -1, 0, 1],
 [2, 0, 2, -1, 0],
 [3, 1, -1, 0, -1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

<a id='comment:38'>Comment 38:</a>
The big change I made was that I altered how the caching was done for the idempotents. Specifically, I moved the caching into the SGA itself with a custom cache. Although I also write one that uses `@cached_method` with a slightly intricate `key` to extract the p-core when needed.

Advantages:

- Things are not permanently nailed in a (non-publically accessible) function cache. So when you stop working with a particular SGA, then it will be garbage collected.
- You do not have to redo the computation across partitions that have the same p-core.
- The character table and `indices` does not have to constantly be recomputed across a block.
- We can work with lower-level objects (e.g., a dict) safely.

Disadvantages:

- The cache of cpi's over **Q** is no longer shared. So if you create a bunch of SGAs with different fields (say, with different characteristics) but with the same n, the **Q** computation will have to be redone for each of the SGAs.

I think the advantages, in particular the better locality of the cache, outweighs the disadvantages. Now we can get around the looks-like-a-memory-leak issue by making the separate function cache a `@weak_cache_function`, but then it is possible (maybe even likely) the results will be GC'ed and then have to be redone.

Some timings:

```
sage: S3 = SymmetricGroup(10).algebra(GF(3))
sage: _ = S3._blocks_dictionary  # So this is created and will not affect the timings
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([1])
CPU times: user 1.2 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 1.21 s
Wall time: 1.21 s
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([2,1,1])
CPU times: user 332 ms, sys: 44 ms, total: 376 ms
Wall time: 333 ms
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([3,1])
CPU times: user 416 ms, sys: 36 ms, total: 452 ms
Wall time: 405 ms
```
vs caching `_blocks_dictionary` and other optimizations:

```
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([1])
CPU times: user 2.51 s, sys: 248 ms, total: 2.76 s
Wall time: 2.77 s
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([2,1,1])
CPU times: user 1.26 s, sys: 236 ms, total: 1.49 s
Wall time: 1.49 s
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([3,1])
CPU times: user 1.2 s, sys: 192 ms, total: 1.4 s
Wall time: 1.39 s
```
vs your branch

```
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([1])
CPU times: user 2.7 s, sys: 260 ms, total: 2.96 s
Wall time: 3 s
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([2,1,1])
CPU times: user 1.84 s, sys: 312 ms, total: 2.15 s
Wall time: 2.15 s
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([3,1])
CPU times: user 1.92 s, sys: 312 ms, total: 2.23 s
Wall time: 2.23 s
```

I ended up seeing another way to get further speed out in positive characteristic: do not compute the cycle types over and over again. This leads to the following timings:

```
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([1])
CPU times: user 360 ms, sys: 36 ms, total: 396 ms
Wall time: 393 ms
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([2,1,1])
CPU times: user 120 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 128 ms
Wall time: 120 ms
sage: %time idem = S3.central_orthogonal_idempotent([3,1])
CPU times: user 192 ms, sys: 24 ms, total: 216 ms
Wall time: 195 ms
```

Perhaps the best thing to do would be to iterate over the partitions in reverse order and then iterate over the conjugacy classes. However, this is sufficient for now I think as it is already a 10x speedup.
