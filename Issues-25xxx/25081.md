Currently, sage does not carry the backend used when creating the polar polyhedron object:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(4,backend='cdd')
sage: C.polar().backend()
'ppl'
```

For consistency, it would make sense that sage tries to keep the backend used by self.

Yes; there is no real difference between `ZZ` and `QQ` at the backend level. The difference between a `ZZ` polyhedron and `QQ` polyhedron inside sage is somewhat artificial.
