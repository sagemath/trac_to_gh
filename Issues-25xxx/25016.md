Adds [PyCygwin](https://github.com/embray/PyCygwin) as a standard package, though only actually *installed* on Cygwin.

This is a little project I've been working on off-and-on to provide Python binding's for Cygwin's C-level API.  It's far from complete but I made an initial release since I would like to have even this small amount of functionality for fixing a few Cygwin-related issues in Sage.

Indeed, I actually have an open issue for that on Cython (just search "build_cython" in their github) but I haven't pursued it lately.
