Because of this special case, some optimizations that I plan to do in #25505 become harder. Instead, this constructor from a filename is changed to a staticmethod `Matrix_gfpn_dense.from_filename()`.

2. Add a new function `new_mtx` to create a new `Matrix_gfpn_dense` from a meataxe `Matrix_t*` and use it where applicable. This simplifies a lot of existing code. It allows to remove `_new()` and many calls to `__copy__`.

3. Remove `self._cache = {}` and `self._is_immutable = False` where possible because those shouldn't be needed.

Basically the only reason is history: When I created p_group_cohomology-1.0 and the wrapper for MeatAxe used to be part of the spkg rather than the Sage library, I needed to be able to read matrices from a file created with one of the MeatAxe executables --- and I thought the easiest way is to provide the file to `__init__`.

I would need to change a couple of places in p_group_cohomology (dunno how many places), but that would certainly be doable.

No, it is initialized to `None` which is sufficient.

Is it? I thought at some point I got an error when I failed to initialise it to an empty dict. But maybe I'm misremembering.

It is really important to support this:

```
            sage: M = Matrix_gfpn_dense.__new__(Matrix_gfpn_dense)   # optional: meataxe
            sage: N = copy(M)
```

I would prefer to raise an exception when copying an uninitialized matrix.

No objections.

**Edit:** I did look at the changeset introduced here, and it looks good to me. So, if all tests pass and Travis thinks it is good, then I not only have no objections but I support the positive review.

This ticket is the only dependency for #18514. So, I guess I can resume work there.
