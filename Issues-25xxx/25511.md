I would need to change a couple of places in p_group_cohomology (dunno how many places), but that would certainly be doable.

Replying to [ticket:25511 jdemeyer]:
> 1. The class `Matrix_gfpn_dense` has a special (and undocumented!) 

I have an example for it in the doctests, but admittedly in the beginning of the docstring of `__init__` it isn't mentioned.

> 2. Add a new function `new_from_meataxe` to create a new `Matrix_gfpn_dense` from a meataxe `Matrix_t*` and use it where applicable.

That'd certainly be useful. IIRC I have such functions in my cohomology code, but certainly they'd belong here.
 
> 3. Remove `self._cache = {}` and `self._is_immutable = False` where possible because those shouldn't be needed.

Why? Because Cython would automatically initialise a cdef dict attribute to an empty dict?

It is really important to support this:

```
            sage: M = Matrix_gfpn_dense.__new__(Matrix_gfpn_dense)   # optional: meataxe
            sage: N = copy(M)

I would prefer to raise an exception when copying an uninitialized matrix.

No objections.

**Edit:** I did look at the changeset introduced here, and it looks good to me. So, if all tests pass and Travis thinks it is good, then I not only have no objections but I support the positive review.

This ticket is the only dependency for #18514. So, I guess I can resume work there.
