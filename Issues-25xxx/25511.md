Basically the only reason is history: When I created p_group_cohomology-1.0 and the wrapper for MeatAxe used to be part of the spkg rather than the Sage library, I needed to be able to read matrices from a file created with one of the MeatAxe executables --- and I thought the easiest way is to provide the file to `__init__`.

I would need to change a couple of places in p_group_cohomology (dunno how many places), but that would certainly be doable.

Why? Because Cython would automatically initialise a cdef dict attribute to an empty dict?

No, it is initialized to `None` which is sufficient.

Is it? I thought at some point I got an error when I failed to initialise it to an empty dict. But maybe I'm misremembering.

It is really important to support this:

```
            sage: M = Matrix_gfpn_dense.__new__(Matrix_gfpn_dense)   # optional: meataxe
            sage: N = copy(M)
```

I would prefer to raise an exception when copying an uninitialized matrix.
