```
`GelfandTsetlinPattern` instances created using `GelfandTsetlinPatterns(...)` with and without the `top_row` argument do not compare properly. E.g.,

```python
sage: GelfandTsetlinPatterns(top_row=(1,))[0]
[[1]]
sage: GelfandTsetlinPattern([[1]])
[[1]]
```

should compare as equal, but:

```python
sage: GelfandTsetlinPatterns(top_row=(1,))[0] == GelfandTsetlinPattern([[1]])
False
```

This is likely because the two instances have different parents (`GelfandTsetlinPatternsTopRow` vs `GelfandTsetlinPatterns`).

First, author real name.

Second, this is wrong on a few different levels. What is going wrong is basically a lack of coercion and subclasses of `ClonableArray` take the parent into consideration. So in some ways, it is a "feature" of the class, and what you should be doing is actually implementing a coercion. We don't do this for tableaux both as that is more complicated and historical reasons (e.g., comparing with a list). Note that this change expands what can be compared. I also am not sure I agree with mapping the rows to a tuple of tuples; seems like a waste.

You should remove the `.. TODO::` because this is not a decided policy change that this says it is (I agree with you that it should change).

Other trivial point, your `INPUT:` block is mis-formatted, you should start <code>- \`\`other\`\`</code> (but that and the `OUTPUT:` block can be left off because both they are trivial and common and this is hidden method).

Thank you for the review.

1. Since the git commit shows my real name I assume you were talking about the list at https://trac.sagemath.org and have added myself there.

2. Done. (I have not implemented a coercion from `GelfandTsetlinPatterns` to `GelfandTsetlinPatternsTopRow`.)

3. Done. (The TODO comment referred to the fact that this was a hack, not to any policy decision. Now it's not a hack anymore, so the TODO was removed. ;)

4. Done. (Someone should also fix this in `Tableau`.)
