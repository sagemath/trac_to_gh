Currently if base ring is `QQ`, similar algorithm is used as in case of `NumberFields` (even basic enumeration is much faster than that).
Also there should be a separate file for rational point algorithms (as in the case of other schemes) to keep things universal.

Also sufficient examples should be present for each algorithm.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This looks like a good start. The one big thing is that the points_of_bounded_height should be a true iterator and not an iterator that you construct after creating the list of all points.

One other minor thing:

```
self._components[i]
```
can just be `self[i]' since it is better not to access the private data directly.


Once you make this an iterator I'll do some functionality testing.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Still having trouble here with creating true iterators and unnecessary lists of points.

In general the doc says then enum_* functions should return a list and the points_of_bounded_heigth functions should return an iterator.

---

in enum_product you are building off of the enum_projective function which is creating an entire list which you then turn into an iterator.

```
R = X.codomain().ambient_space()
m = R.num_components()
iters = [ iter(enum_projective_rational_field(R[i], B)) for i in range(m) ]
```

better would be to just start with iterators and never have the whole list

```
R = X.codomain().ambient_space()
iters = [P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B) for P in R]
```

---

in points_of_bounded_height you'll need more significant changes. You have

```
comp_points = [list(self[i].points_of_bounded_height(bound=B, tolerance=tol, precision=prec)) for i in range(m)]
```
which is taking an iterator turning it into a list and then a couple lines later you turn it back into an iterator.

You should avoid the conversion to a list and use
the same type of logic as enum_product_projective_rational_field with

```
iters = [P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B, tolerance=tol, precision=prec) for P in self]
```

From looking through the code only a few minor things

white space needed

```
dim_prefix = [0,dim[0]] # prefixes dim list

2 places - for i in range(1,len(dim)):

sage: enum_product_projective_number_field(X,bound=1.5)

sage: PP.<x,y,z,w> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1, 1],GF(3))

sage: PP.<x0,x1,x2,x3> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1, 1],GF(17))

sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import \
enum_product_projective_finite_field
```

Spelling

```
# add the intial point
```

extra word 'for'

```
Naive algorithms for enumerating rational points over `\QQ`, number fields or
finite fields over *for* general schemes.
```

It won't change anything for these functions but it would be better to use

```
R[i].dimension_relative()
```
instead of

```
R[i].dimension()
```
There are two places to change this.
