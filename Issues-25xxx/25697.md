Currently if base ring is `QQ`, similar algorithm is used as in case of `NumberFields` (even basic enumeration is much faster than that).
Also there should be a separate file for rational point algorithms (as in the case of other schemes) to keep things universal.

Also sufficient examples should be present for each algorithm.

I have added `Volker Braun and Ben Hutz (2014): initial version` for rational_points file. Since some algorithms are similar to one in homsets file. Is that correct?

This looks like a good start. The one big thing is that the points_of_bounded_height should be a true iterator and not an iterator that you construct after creating the list of all points.

One other minor thing:

```
self._components[i]
```
can just be `self[i]' since it is better not to access the private data directly.


Once you make this an iterator I'll do some functionality testing.

Just adding the yield doesn't do it. The line

```
comp_points = [list(self[i].points_of_bounded_height(bound=B, tolerance=tol, precision=prec)) for i in range(m)]
```
is still creating the list of all points.

Take a look at how points_of_bounded_height works for affine_space.py where it is creating a list of iterators for the coordinates and the stepping through the iterators to yield the points in succession without ever creating the list of all points.

Still having trouble here with creating true iterators and unnecessary lists of points.

In general the doc says then enum_* functions should return a list and the points_of_bounded_heigth functions should return an iterator.

---

in enum_product you are building off of the enum_projective function which is creating an entire list which you then turn into an iterator.

```
R = X.codomain().ambient_space()
m = R.num_components()
iters = [ iter(enum_projective_rational_field(R[i], B)) for i in range(m) ]
```

better would be to just start with iterators and never have the whole list

```
R = X.codomain().ambient_space()
iters = [P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B) for P in R]
```

---

in points_of_bounded_height you'll need more significant changes. You have

```
comp_points = [list(self[i].points_of_bounded_height(bound=B, tolerance=tol, precision=prec)) for i in range(m)]
```
which is taking an iterator turning it into a list and then a couple lines later you turn it back into an iterator.

You should avoid the conversion to a list and use
the same type of logic as enum_product_projective_rational_field with

```
iters = [P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B, tolerance=tol, precision=prec) for P in self]
```

<a id='comment:18'></a>
docs building and long tests are running...

---

From looking through the code only a few minor things

white space needed

```
dim_prefix = [0,dim[0]] # prefixes dim list

2 places - for i in range(1,len(dim)):

sage: enum_product_projective_number_field(X,bound=1.5)

sage: PP.<x,y,z,w> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1, 1],GF(3))

sage: PP.<x0,x1,x2,x3> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1, 1],GF(17))

sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import \
enum_product_projective_finite_field
```

Spelling

```
# add the intial point
```

extra word 'for'

```
Naive algorithms for enumerating rational points over `\QQ`, number fields or
finite fields over *for* general schemes.
```

It won't change anything for these functions but it would be better to use

```
R[i].dimension_relative()
```
instead of

```
R[i].dimension()
```
There are two places to change this.
