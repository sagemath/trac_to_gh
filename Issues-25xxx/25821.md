<a id='comment:3'></a>Concept is fine, but the code can be made more readable

```
return max([self[i].global_height(prec=prec) \
                     for i in range(self.codomain().ambient_space().num_components())])
```
to

```
return max([t.global_height(prec=prec) for t in self])
```

I think more explanation is warranted in the docs as well. i.e., that you are taking the max of the heights of the component points.

and similarly for local height.

I have made it more readable though.
