Concept is fine, but the code can be made more readable

```
return max([self[i].global_height(prec=prec) \
                     for i in range(self.codomain().ambient_space().num_components())])
```
to

```
return max([t.global_height(prec=prec) for t in self])
```

I think more explanation is warranted in the docs as well. i.e., that you are taking the max of the heights of the component points.

and similarly for local height.

I think `return max([t.global_height(prec=prec) for t in self]` won't work since `__iter__()` function iterates over all coordinates, but here we need to iterate over all components. If we take max over all coordinates then we need to add a function to convert the space defined over `QQbar` to `NumberField`, as done in projective_point.

I have made it more readable though.
