```
Running the tests in a system with Spanish locale gives some failures, such as

```
File "src/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1506, in sage.calculus.calculus.laplace
Failed example:
    laplace(t^n, t, s, algorithm='giac')
Expected:
    laplace(t^n, t, s)
Got:
    integrar(t^n*e^(-s*t), t, 0, +Infinity)
```

This is caused by giac returning localized output depending on the system locale.

This became a much bigger problem now that #27958 is in and some integrals are computed using giac. For instance, this doesn't work in 8.9.beta4 with LANG=es_ES:

```
sage: integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x)
integrar(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
```

as opposed to the expected

```
1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
```

Are you aware of any other interface affected by this? This branch is meant to fix a very concrete issue with giac, perhaps it can be extended in the future if some other interfaces are found to misbehave with non-English LC_MESSAGES. I'd rather not risk running into potential unexpected side effects of modifying additional env variables.
