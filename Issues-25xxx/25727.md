```
Running the tests in a system with Spanish locale gives some failures, such as

```
File "src/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1506, in sage.calculus.calculus.laplace
Failed example:
    laplace(t^n, t, s, algorithm='giac')
Expected:
    laplace(t^n, t, s)
Got:
    integrar(t^n*e^(-s*t), t, 0, +Infinity)
```

This is caused by giac returning localized output depending on the system locale.

This became a much bigger problem now that #27958 is in and some integrals are computed using giac. For instance, this doesn't work in 8.9.beta4 with LANG=es_ES:

```
sage: integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x)
integrar(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
```

as opposed to the expected

```
1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
```

Are you aware of any other interface affected by this? This branch is meant to fix a very concrete issue with giac, perhaps it can be extended in the future if some other interfaces are found to misbehave with non-English LC_MESSAGES. I'd rather not risk running into potential unexpected side effects of modifying additional env variables.

But then your original version that only applied to the giac interface makes more sense to me.
