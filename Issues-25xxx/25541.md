<div id="comment:0"></div>

The `star_involution`, `omega_involution` and `psi_involution` methods of `FQSym` restrict to the subalgebra `FSym` (the Poirier-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of tableaux). They also "restrict" to the quotient `FSym^*`. This is in the paper by Poirier and Reutenauer.

Depends on #25326
