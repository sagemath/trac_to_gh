You need it, because it's exposing the buffer of a `bytes` object as a `char *`, so you need to keep a reference to that `bytes` object around as long as its buffer is being used by external C code.

Cython can usually detect this and will actually refuse to compile if you don't handle it properly, though I'm not completely positive if it would have complained in this case or not.  Sometimes it's also clever enough to create a temporary reference to the object itself, but I haven't worked out exactly when it does or doesn't do that.
