    Adds a new `sdh_install` helper function:

    This is like a very simplified version of the `install` program, and is
    intended for use by packages whose spkg-install just copies some files (or
    more complex packages that copy some files as one of its steps).  The
    majority of its functionality is just in ensuring that the full destination
    path exists, and to provide some error checking.  This replaces some
    patterns that occur frequently in some spkg-installs.

    Also updates the mathjax and thebe packages as two examples of its usage (this implements #24024 for those packages).

**Keywords:** destdir mathjax thebe

1. I don't really understand the point of

```
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        sdh_die "At least a source and destination file are required"
    fi
```
since it would fail anyway later and no error message would be given for `sdh_install -T`.

2. It looks strange to put this in an `else` block, it's just part of the normal flow of execution:

```
    else
        dest="${SAGE_DESTDIR}$dest"
    fi
```

3. I seem to recall that `cp -R` is more portable than `cp -r`. So unless you have a good reason for using `cp -r`, I recommend `cp -R`.

4. For consistency, I would start all `sdh_die` messages with `Error:`

5. `echo "Installing files for ${PKG_NAME}:"` looks like unneeded verbosity. I would drop that.

6. If `mkdir` or `cp` fails, it already prints an error message, so I don't need that we need `sdh_die` for that. I would just write `cp ... || exit $?`.

I mean, it will still fail for `sdh_install -T` because the `$src` variable will be empty. I thought an explicit check of "there are arguments" would enhance clarity but in retrospect I agree it's superfluous.

+1 Some of the other `sdh_` commands had some kind of message like this so I put it in for consistency.  But after trying this on a few packages it hasn't been too helpful (especially in cases where there are multiple `sdh_install` calls in the package).

A lot of the code this function is replacing was also adding its own error messages on top of `mkdir` and/or `cp`, so this was just carried over from that.  In most cases those programs' error messages should be sufficient though.
