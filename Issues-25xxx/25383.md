**Globals starting with g-z**

Sage did actually have some proto-database functionality but that never really went very far.

I'm not sure that `desolve` should move; similarly with the various types of matrices.  In a lot of contexts you really want the absolutely easiest dumb-sounding command, and extra object-oriented stuff can be confusing there.

That said, most of these probably indeed are a bit specific for top-level.  Seems like the kind of thing to put on sage-devel and allow people to ask for things to be separately discussed if necessary: see e.g. [consent agendas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent#Consent_Agenda).

This is not a strong opinion. I just made up a list by quickly looking at `dir()`. Concerning the two names you mention:

- what is `alarm` useful for for a Sage user that does not know how to import it?
- `column_matrix` is accessible via `matrix.column` and I believe it is easier (if properly advertised) to use the second version

Removing from the global namespace is different from removing.

I almost exclusively use sage through the emacs interface (in fact, I don't even really know the ipython interface), and having a cleaner top level namespace might be quite helpful there.  I have, apart from aesthetics, two reasons:

* the list of suggestions becomes shorter, so when looking for something, I have less to read or search through, and thus better chances not to miss the needle in the haystack,

* tab completion has a better chance of working, that is, I have fewer characters to type to get completion.

However, I must say that things are not terribly bad currently.  So in case of doubt, I'd leave a particular item in the global name space.

I think `alarm()` is useful for general users, so long as we advertise it.  I actually thought that it did come up in some of the user documentation, though it appears not.  It is, however, used in a number of doctests.

`alarm()` is an easy way for a user to set a timeout for a long-running computation without having to manually Ctrl-C, and can even be more responsive.  For example:

```
sage: try:
....:     alarm(5)
....:     print('computing some optimization that might diverge...')
....:     import time; time.sleep(10)
....:     print('done')
....: except AlarmInterrupt:
....:     print('calculation took too long')
....:     
....:     
computing some optimization that might diverge...
calculation took too long
```

(as an aside, there is currently a bug when using a bare `alarm()` call in the IPython REPL without explictly catching the `AlarmInterrupt`, but it works fine as in the example above.  I thought I had an issue opened for that but I can't seem to find it...
