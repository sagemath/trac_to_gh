I'm not entirely sure that `banner` is unused. I can see that being actually used somewhere as `from sage.all import banner`. Although deprecating it cannot hurt.

The rest should be no problem.

Sage did actually have some proto-database functionality but that never really went very far.

I'm not sure that `desolve` should move; similarly with the various types of matrices.  In a lot of contexts you really want the absolutely easiest dumb-sounding command, and extra object-oriented stuff can be confusing there.

That said, most of these probably indeed are a bit specific for top-level.  Seems like the kind of thing to put on sage-devel and allow people to ask for things to be separately discussed if necessary: see e.g. [consent agendas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent#Consent_Agenda).

What's wrong with `alarm` and `column_matrix`? (just picking two which look genuinely useful)

This is not a strong opinion. I just made up a list by quickly looking at `dir()`. Concerning the two names you mention:

- what is `alarm` useful for for a Sage user that does not know how to import it?
- `column_matrix` is accessible via `matrix.column` and I believe it is easier (if properly advertised) to use the second version

Removing from the global namespace is different from removing.

The length is not so important. The problem is that you have access to so many specialized and/or useless functions.

The only reasonable strategies I know for searching for a functionality in Sage is the tab-completion and grepping the source. While the latter technique is powerful it is not ideal for a newcomer. The Sage documentation could have been an alternative but it is very bad at the moment. The only references I know where things are organized are the books written about Sage (e.g. "Calcul MathÃ©matique avec Sage" by Zimmermann et al.)

So it is not about **learning** but about **searching**. I am focusing not on the newcomers, but the next stage (learners?). The problem is "I want to do that, how do I do"?

> I think some culling can definitely be done, but the change has a cost, so I think it should be justified. What benefit do we get from culling? 


Cost for the developer? Cost for the reviewer? Cost for the one person who uses an ultra specialized feature that is imported by default?

I've tried that occasionally (not particularly on graphs) and have been underwhelmed with the results. Namespaces in python are generally too cluttered to be useful in that way (plus, the standard IPython interfaces give the completion list in a very small window, without much additional information). I have generally resorted to using "google" to get a hold of some relevant documentation.

Methods `all_max_clique`, `max_clique` and `clique_number` are imported into the global namespace in file `src/sage/graphs/all.py`. It contains `from sage.graphs.cliquer import *`. This can be removed as these methods are all already methods of `Graph`.

How should we proceed: open a specific ticket for that? add a deprecation warning, but with what message ?

I think `alarm()` is useful for general users, so long as we advertise it.  I actually thought that it did come up in some of the user documentation, though it appears not.  It is, however, used in a number of doctests.

`alarm()` is an easy way for a user to set a timeout for a long-running computation without having to manually Ctrl-C, and can even be more responsive.  For example:

```
sage: try:
....:     alarm(5)
....:     print('computing some optimization that might diverge...')
....:     import time; time.sleep(10)
....:     print('done')
....: except AlarmInterrupt:
....:     print('calculation took too long')
....:     
....:     
computing some optimization that might diverge...
calculation took too long
```

(as an aside, there is currently a bug when using a bare `alarm()` call in the IPython REPL without explictly catching the `AlarmInterrupt`, but it works fine as in the example above.  I thought I had an issue opened for that but I can't seem to find it...
