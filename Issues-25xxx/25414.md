1/CIF(RIF(-1,1),0) results in infinite recursion.

While looking at the code, I also noticed the following underlying function has a memory leak:

```
ComplexIntervalFieldElement.__invert__
```

Can you post some timings? From a quick look at the code, it looks like you are avoiding calls to the multiplication (which should result in a speedup).

I was able to confirm the memory leak:

```
sage: for i in range(1,100000):
....:     I = CIF.gen(0)
....:     _ = ~CIF((-i,-i),0)
....:     if i % 1000 == 0:
....:         gc.collect()
....:         get_memory_usage()

Sure, here is an example of what I did:

```
sage: z = CIF(1,2)
sage: %timeit z.__invert__()
The slowest run took 19.07 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.84 Âµs per loop
```

And here are the results:

```
            before     after
CIF( 1, 2)   1.88 us    1.84 us    
CIF( 1,-2)   6.42 us    1.86 us
CIF(-1, 2)   7.40 us    1.89 us
CIF(-1,-2)   4.46 us    1.91 us

```

Just add your real name to the authors field and you can set a positive review.

Also, something I noticed is `RIF` is inconsistent with the others:

```
sage: 1 / CBF((-1,1),(-1,1))
nan + nan*I
sage: 1 / CBF((-1,1),0)
nan
sage: 1 / CBF(0,(-1,1))
nan*I
sage: 1 / RBF((-1,1))
nan
sage: 1 / CIF((-1,1),(-1,1))
[.. NaN ..] + [.. NaN ..]*I
sage: 1 / RIF((-1,1))
[-infinity .. +infinity]
```
However, that (and IMO, the latter two `CBF` inverses are wrong too) is a separate issue that can be handled on a followup with possibly a question on sage-devel about the behavior.

In particular, I am against mpfi's choice because we have this\n\n```\nsage: 0 * (1/RIF(-1,1))\n0\n```\n\nHowever when the function is multi-valued (like complex log) I think interval arithmetic should be allowed to choose a lift. So while \n\n```\nsage: CIF(RIF(-1),RIF(-0.0001,0.0001)).argument()\n3.142?\n```\nmakes sense to me, **mpfi_atan2** yields NaN (if memory serves correctly) if fed the above real and imaginary part. By the way, sage does not expose **mpfi_atan2**, also see comment 4 of ticket #25340.\n\nI honestly don't understand that part of the mpfi design: if it is so conservative for atan2 why be so relaxed about division.\n\nBut all this is a separate issue.",

The latter behavior comes from mpfi and is not what I would like or what I would have expected from mpfi: I would argue that whenever an interval contains any value where a function is not defined, the result should be NaN. In particular, I am against mpfi's choice because we have this

```
sage: 0 * (1/RIF(-1,1))
0
```

However when the function is multi-valued (like complex log) I think interval arithmetic should be allowed to choose a lift. So while 

```
sage: CIF(RIF(-1),RIF(-0.0001,0.0001)).argument()
3.142?
```
makes sense to me, **mpfi_atan2** yields NaN (if memory serves correctly) if fed the above real and imaginary part. By the way, sage does not expose **mpfi_atan2**, also see comment 4 of ticket #25340.

I honestly don't understand that part of the mpfi design: if it is so conservative for atan2 why be so relaxed about division.

But all this is a separate issue.
