Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03393 , from a practical viewpoint even for small p this should speed up Coleman integration also due to the lower level implementation. This requires changing our included copy of the hypellfrob library, which the original author David Harvey has told me is fine as the upstream is not being updated.

Work Issues: **Cleanup code and push**
