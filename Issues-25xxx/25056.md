This is despite the fact that printing the banner works:

But why would you write UTF-8 encoded text when you have no idea whether `stdout` is actually expecting UTF-8? I would make a lot more sense to say "I don't know the encoding, so let's be safe and assume ASCII".

I don't know what you mean by "actual encoding".  There is no "actual encoding".  It's a file descriptor.  If you want to write some text to a file descriptor it always has to have some encoding and that has to come from somewhere.

I don't think the sarcasm is necessary--I see your point but it's not completely obvious, and you had the opportunity here to set it back to "needs_work" or something--I wouldn't mind.  Please open a new ticket for this and CC me and set it to "blocker".  An easy fix for this would be to ensure "VERSION.txt" is installed somewhere sensinble under `$SAGE_LOCAL` (like, *not* `bin/` :) and use it from there if possible.

> I don't think the sarcasm is necessary--I see your point but it's not completely obvious, and you had the opportunity here to set it back to "needs_work" or something--I wouldn't mind.  Please open a new ticket for this and CC me and set it to "blocker".  An easy fix for this would be to ensure "VERSION.txt" is installed somewhere sensinble under `$SAGE_LOCAL` (like, *not* `bin/` :) and use it from there if possible.


I noticed this ticket because Volker included it on his branch. Rather than sarcasm, that's my exasperation at some stuff that bleeds out. I spent quite a bit of time over the years reducing the use of `SAGE_ROOT`. People just forget. For info I ship `VERSION.txt` as `/etc/sage-version.txt` which seems sensible but may not be the best place. I should ask what the other do.
