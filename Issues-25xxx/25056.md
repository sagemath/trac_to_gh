But why would you write UTF-8 encoded text when you have no idea whether `stdout` is actually expecting UTF-8? I would make a lot more sense to say "I don't know the encoding, so let's be safe and assume ASCII".

Or worse in my opinion. When Python 2 doesn't know the encoding, it honestly says so. With Python 3, saying "I don't know" is not an option, so it just guesses some encoding.

Indeed. And I was happy that this bug (writing UTF-8 regardless of actual encoding) finally got fixed in #24825. And now you suggest to revert that fix.

I don't know what you mean by "actual encoding".  There is no "actual encoding".  It's a file descriptor.  If you want to write some text to a file descriptor it always has to have some encoding and that has to come from somewhere.

I don't think the sarcasm is necessary--I see your point but it's not completely obvious, and you had the opportunity here to set it back to "needs_work" or something--I wouldn't mind.  Please open a new ticket for this and CC me and set it to "blocker".  An easy fix for this would be to ensure "VERSION.txt" is installed somewhere sensinble under `$SAGE_LOCAL` (like, *not* `bin/` :) and use it from there if possible.
