# Issue 25298: When should two SkewPartition objects be equal?

The current behavior for SkewPartition is

```
sp = SkewPartition([[4, 1], [1, 1]])
sp2 = SkewPartition([[4, 1], [1, 1]])
sp3 = SkewPartition([[4], [1]])

sp == sp2
True

sp == sp3
False
```

Is this the desired behavior?  I am writing new code #25295 and it's possible that sp == sp3 being True will be more useful.  So I'm wondering if other code/mathematics depends on remembering the *original* inner and outer partitions that were used to create the SkewPartition and would fail if we used an equivalent pair of inner and outer partitions instead.

This distinction is important if you are doing anything where you have to take residues (which I have done in my research). So -1 from me on having `sp == sp3` being `True`.
