I installed sagemath 8.3rc0 on my fedora 28 linux x86_64 system and tried building sage using `make -j4` but this caused the build to fail with `python3` and `python2` build errors. 

I solved this problem by changing the commands to:

`$ make configure`

`$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/sage --with-python=3 --with-mp=gmp`

`$ make build`

This seemed to have installed sage successfully but when I run tests with:

`$ make ptest`

I get the following errors and `make ptest` fails:

    
```
[manifolds]     from Queue import Queue

    [manifolds] ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Queue'

    OSError: [manifolds] /home/user/sagemath/inst/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/manifolds/differentiable/curve.py:docstring of sage.manifolds.differentiable.curve.DifferentiableCurve:58: WARNING: Exception occurred in plotting curve-1

    [dochtml] [manifolds] dumping object inventory... done

Error building Sage.
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):
* documentation: dochtml
  log file: /home/user/sagemath/src/logs/pkgs/../dochtml.log
The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.

make[1]: *** [Makefile:33: all-start] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/user/sagemath/src'
make: *** [Makefile:13: all] Error 2

```

I believe one of `OSError` or `dochtml` error is causing `make ptest` to fail. Can I get advice on how I can correct these problems so I can start using sage for work?

If you want now a fully functional sage that passes "make ptestlong", switch to python2.

If you want to use sage with python3, your are welcome to help.

and sage with python3 cannot really be qualified as working. It "sort of works", but may soon fail in unexpected ways, depending on what you do..

`make build -j4` should work, I think

`make ptest` will fail, there is not point in running that.

If you're referring to Frédéric's example of

```
sage: G=Graph([['a',2]])
```

it has nothing directly to do with plotting.  It creates a graph, in the sense of [graph theory](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Quickstarts/Graphs-and-Discrete.html), of two vertices labeled `'a'` and `2`.  Granted, graphs can be plotted graphically.

> * Are you saying that plotting graphs don't work with python3 sagemath?


Maybe, maybe not.  It depends.

> * Can you clarify what skipping building the doc means? Is it that there will be no in built documentation in sage?


When you run `make` to build Sage+dependencies it will also build a copy of the documentation.  If you run just `make build` it will build all software, but won't try to build the documentation (this can be done separately by running `make doc`).
