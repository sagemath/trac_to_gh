On conda we are seeing compile errors like the following:

```
build/cythonized/sage/libs/eclib/wrap.cpp:136:36: error: using typedef-name ‘bigint’ after ‘struct’
                       const struct bigint* x, const struct bigint* y,
```

Removing the `struct` fixes the problem. I am not an expert when it comes to C++ but since bigint is already typedef, I don't think the struct should be there, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612328/difference-between-struct-and-typedef-struct-in-c for the meaning of the struct keyword.

Indeed, I'm surprised that worked at all.  Perhaps on other compilers there were just warnings that we were ignoring.

I've long wanted to take stock of some of our compilation warnings and see if there's anything worth doing about any of them, but it's been pretty low on the list.

Me too. Sometimes, when I work on a particular file, I fix some warnings.
