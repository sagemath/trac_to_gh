In Debian (and Conda and probably all others…) the following doctest fails:

```
Failed example:
    _ = getattr_debug(IntSlider(), "value")
Expected:
    getattr_debug(obj=IntSlider(value=0, min=0, max=100, step=1), name='value'):
      type(obj) = <class 'ipywidgets.widgets.widget_int.IntSlider'>
      object has __dict__ slot (<type 'dict'>)
      found 'value' in dict of <class 'ipywidgets.widgets.widget_int._Int'>
      got <traitlets.traitlets.CInt object at ... (<class 'traitlets.traitlets.CInt'>)
      attribute is data descriptor (has __get__ and __set__)
      ignoring __dict__ because we have a data descriptor
      calling __get__()
      returning 0 (<type 'int'>)
Got:
    getattr_debug(obj=<ipywidgets.widgets.widget_int.IntSlider object~~~, name='value'):
      type(obj) = <class 'ipywidgets.widgets.widget_int.IntSlider'>
      object has __dict__ slot (<type 'dict'>)
      found 'value' in dict of <class 'ipywidgets.widgets.widget_int._Int'>
      got <traitlets.traitlets.CInt object at 0x7f7296f58~~~ (<class 'traitlets.traitlets.CInt'>)
      attribute is data descriptor (has __get__ and __set__)
      ignoring __dict__ because we have a data descriptor
      calling __get__()
      returning 0 (<type 'int'>)
```

The reason appears to be that they use a different version of ipywidgets.

I could fix the doctest but adding a lot of `...` but I would rather remove a doctest that checks implementation details of an external libray.

The test is meant for a data descriptor. Any `@property` would work for this doctest.
