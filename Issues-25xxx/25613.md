The Graph.is_gallai_tree() method checks for whether a block's vertices induce a cycle tests if the number of edges is one more than the number of vertices. These should be the same.

The third-to-last-line currently has the test: gg.size() == len(c)+1

It *should* have the test: gg.size() == len(c)

A graph which is a 5-cycle with an appended edge to an external vertex is a gallai tree. But the existing method returns False. Call this graph "gg":

```python
gg=graphs.CycleGraph(5)
gg.add_edge(0,5)
gg.is_gallai_tree() 
```

should return: True.
