While packaging sage for nixos, I needed to configure some paths in addition to the already provided environment variables. Specifically I added `COMBINATORIAL_DESIGN_DATA_DIR`, `CREMONA_MINI_DATA_DIR`, `CREMONA_LARGE_DATA_DIR`, `JMOL_DIR`, `JSMOL_DIR`, `MATHJAX_DIR` and`THREEJS_DIR`.

I think those changes should be included in the sage distribution.

gh-timokau, nice work. It'd be great to have more of these things configurable.

I wonder what should be the general approach here. I guess it would be good to have an example that we can follow in the future for other SPGKs:

Should some things be set at `./configure`-time and not be modifiable through environment variables? What should be configurable through environment variables? How should these be named? Should they all be `SAGE_*`? Or are they sufficiently general that it makes sense to drop the `SAGE_` prefix?

There are  a couple of instances that are glaring to me because 
 1) I provide my own minimal `sage-env` and anything that isn't useful has been thrown out. That includes `GP_DATA_DIR` and `SINGULARPATH`. Never used that before.\\

 2) I don't include it in the default environment.

When working on `env.py` we basically reduced the use of `os.environ` to what was strictly necessary.
So in the extra work I had on my plate
* GAP_BINARY, you changed what to find to something different. gap is admittedly not a particularly well packaged software but using the gap in PATH was good for me.
* MAXIMA_FAS, you actually introduce a more stringent check here. The issue is clearly on Gentoo side in some ways but it introduce the always problematic use of `lib` when on distro it could be `lib64` (there is not a really good solution to that particular one so let it live). The Gentoo more specific issue is that the `ecl` folder is versioned (`ecl-16.1.2` instead of `ecl`) the real problem with that is if we have wriggle room on the version of `ecl` (we don't at the moment). 
* SINGULARPATH well it existed in sage-env. Looking at singular's manual itself it is useful that such variable should defined, although considering that I never had an issue with singular 4 without defining it or overriding the default in the source code (like gentoo was doing in singular-3), it may not be that useful anymore and the documentation may be incorrect.

What is more interesting is that the old way and your new way are probably both broken in sage-on-gentoo but it has never been exposed as such. It may very well be that this setting is not necessary or that something more subtle needs doing at the level of the packaging of pari databases.

There are probably things where we'll have to agree to disagree and I am quite fine with that. I have been in such position with other sage-devs for 10 years after all.

That's fair, `GP_DATA_DIR` and `SINGULARPATH` should've been done differently in this ticket. For what its worth what I do in the nix package is provide a wrapper around sage-env. So I source the original file and then add my own configuration on top.

Note that before it didn't use the gap in PATH, but the gap in SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap. That might coincidentally have been the one in PATH. I don't remember why the file is suddenly named `gap.sh` instead of `gap`.

That's why its configurable :)

> * SINGULARPATH well it existed in sage-env. Looking at singular's manual itself it is useful that such variable should defined, although considering that I never had an issue with singular 4 without defining it or overriding the default in the source code (like gentoo was doing in singular-3), it may not be that useful anymore and the documentation may be incorrect. Anyway I'd rather have a value from `env.py` because if SINGULARPATH is changed, no one may remember to apply the corresponding fix in singular.py.


I agree. However I think that it would be a better option for you to re-think your completely replaced sage-env. Maybe remove variables that don't actually need to be set upstream. Or even better fully replace the whole thing. The way it currently is, it is hard for me to know that I broke something on your modified install.

> * GP_DATA_DIR is an interesting one because again it is only really used until now for the `database_pari` spkg and you have just extended its use. What is more interesting is that the old way and your new way are probably both broken in sage-on-gentoo but it has never been exposed as such. It may very well be that this setting is not necessary or that something more subtle needs doing at the level of the packaging of pari databases.


Relevant: #26010

> There are probably things where we'll have to agree to disagree and I am quite fine with that. I have been in such position with other sage-devs for 10 years after all.


Until now I don't disagree with anything you've said (except maybe completely replacing sage-env). I didn't realize that some of my changes were breaking. I should've requested feedback in sage-packaging. Sorry about that.

A shell script pointing to another shell script actually. "neutering" is mostly a reference to the fact that I remove the packaging abilities of sage to avoid accident. I only keep some minimum to avoid massive patching (go `features`). By extension anything that doesn't fit with a distro is "neutered".

I just found out about this commit. This is also creating issues for Arch. Until now, ECLDIR wasn't used anywhere in Sage code proper, so we simply unset it and everything worked out of the box.

What is making MAXIMA_FAS configurable trying to solve? maxima.fas is an ecl module, it must be installed in the ecl module dir. Is there an actual use case for installing it somewhere else? 

I'm OK with the rest of the patch, but plase reconsider relying on ECLDIR in Sage code.

It only uses ECLDIR as a default for MAXIMA_FAS, so your issue is actually with MAXIMA_FAS right?

Since our ecl is installed to a versioned subdir of /usr/lib (which is the default upstream behavior, the /usr/lib/ecl symlink is Sage specific), we are forced to keep track of the ecl version in the Sage build script, and update and rebuild the package for every single ecl version bump.

Can't you just use a shell glob for the version, or are you using multiple maxima versions at the same time?

Well after this patch it doesnt need to be there anymore. The use case is that nix installs every package into its own prefix. Unfortunately ecl doesn't have an equivalent to PYTHONPATH.

We could revert to the old behaviour in case MAXIMA_FAS and ECLDIR are both unset. Unfortunately I wont be able to implement that myself, because I dislocated my shoulder. Typing with one hand is no fun, let alone coding.

What do you mean by this? ecl doesn't accept glob in the path of 'require'

The problem is that 'unsetting' it now requires more patching, since you're also setting it in env.py. From my POW this is a step backwards in both
- making sage work with unpatched dependencies (since it relies on the sage-specific /usr/lib/ecl path)
