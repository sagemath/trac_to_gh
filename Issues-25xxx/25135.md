in Magma there is a function ShortVectors to evaluate all vectors of a lattice of norm less than a given bound. It would be nice to have such a function in Sage (I did not find it).

For example in Magma:

```
> w := RMatrixSpace(IntegerRing(), 2,2) ! [1,2,3,5];
> L:=Lattice(w);
> ShortVectors(L,1);
[
    <(1 0), 1>,
    <(0 1), 1>
]
```

**Keywords:** LLL BKZ

A starting point might be the `LLL` and `BKZ` methods of matrices over `ZZ`:

thank you, but I opened this ticket precisely because the LLL and BKZ functions (which I put in the keywords by the way) are not sufficient for some applications.
