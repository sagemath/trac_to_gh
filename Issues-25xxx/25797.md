Some more comments:

Pyflakes plugins is not happy.

Maybe use https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ in the header (with https)

What is the default behaviour of evolve : how many steps if number is None ?

Maybe the name András Kaszanyitzky should appear in the file itself ?

Fixed.

> Maybe use https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ in the header (with https)


Fixed, I think.

> What is the default behaviour of evolve : how many steps if number is None ?


Fixed.

> Maybe the name András Kaszanyitzky should appear in the file itself ?


I don't think this is necessary as there is a reference to the paper itself and I don't think there is a natural place to put it.
