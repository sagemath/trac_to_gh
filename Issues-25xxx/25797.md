Here I'm doing ok too, sort of. Trying hard not to turn crazy.

Some more comments:

Pyflakes plugins is not happy.

Maybe use https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ in the header (with https)

What is the default behaviour of evolve : how many steps if number is None ?

Maybe the name András Kaszanyitzky should appear in the file itself ?

Fixed.

Fixed, I think.

I don't think this is necessary as there is a reference to the paper itself and I don't think there is a natural place to put it.
