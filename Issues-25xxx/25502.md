`ContinuousMap` defines its own `__eq__` method, while inheritating from `Morphism.__hash__`. Now, as pointed out in #24551, Python3 breaks the inheritance of `__hash__` when `__eq__` is redefined. This ticket fixes this by implementing `ContinousMap.__hash__`. Moreover, contrary to `Morphism.__hash__`, the new method does not rely on `repr()` and guarantees that two continous maps that compare equal have the same hash.

Note that there is a proposal at #25393 to remove `Morphism.__hash__`. 

`ContinousMap` (more precisely the derived class `DiffMap`) needs to be hashable because `DiffMap` objects serve as keys in the dictionary of vector field modules on a manifold, a module of vector fields on a differentiable manifold being essentially defined by a differentiable map (with the important special case of the identity map; see [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield_module.html) for details).

Yes it's pretty rough, but there should be no loss of efficiency, since continuous maps are only used as keys in the dictionary `DifferentiableManifold._vector_field_modules`, which is of very small size; most of the time, it has a single element (the continuous map being then merely the identity map).
