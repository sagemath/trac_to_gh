Implements #24024 for mpfr.

This one is slightly non-trivial especially in how it uses multiple `configure` calls.  However, my local experiments show that it's just fine to use `sdh_configure` there all the same (though it isn't strictly necessary either).

```

You don't need

See above for the options passed to it, and the file

Ideally yes because the message saying to look at `config.log` is useful. But it should be put in `sdh_configure`, because it is generally useful for all packages using GNU configure. Of course, there should be a check that `config.log` exists.

> the config.log file won't even exist unless built with `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes`.


Directories of a *failed* build are kept anyway.
