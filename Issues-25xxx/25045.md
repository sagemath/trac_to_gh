Implements #24024 for mpfr.

This one is slightly non-trivial especially in how it uses multiple `configure` calls.  However, my local experiments show that it's just fine to use `sdh_configure` there all the same (though it isn't strictly necessary either).

Here, I see no reason to use `sdh_configure`. This is not the real `./configure` run, it is only needed to check some defaults:

```
        ./configure --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL" $SAGE_CONF_OPTS $MPFR_CONFIGURE) &>/dev/null;
```

You don't need

```
Error configuring MPFR.
See above for the options passed to it, and the file
  $(pwd)/config.log
for details.
```
because `sdh_configure` can never fail (it either succeeds or exists the script).

Directories of a *failed* build are kept anyway.

Are you sure? As far as I know, this cannot be customized with GNU autoconf.
