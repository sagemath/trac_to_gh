This ticket implements the projection of combinatorial Hopf algebras FQSym -> QSym, a more efficient transition from the M to the F basis on FQSym (using the Möbius function of the weak order on the symmetric groups), and certain involutions of the combinatorial Hopf algebras WQSym and FQSym:

On WQSym:

- The one that, in the M-basis, reverses the ordered set partition, or equivalently complements the packed word (i.e., replaces letters 1,2,...,k by k,k-1,...,1). This is an automorphism of the algebra structure and an anti-automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The one that, in the M-basis, complements the (elements of the blocks of the) ordered set partition, or equivalently reverts the packed word. This is an anti-automorphism of the algebra structure (which is obvious if you look at WQSym as a subring of formal power series in non-commutative variables: then it's just a restriction of the anti-automorphism that fixes each letter) and an automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The composition of the above two. This is best called the star involution or the Schützenberger anti-automorphism, and is an anti-automorphism of the whole Hopf algebra. Note that this involution restricts to the `star_involution` method of NSym. (The previous two involutions don't restrict to any linear endomorphisms of NSym at all, so we have no caselaw telling us how to call them.)

On FQSym:

The star involution above restricts to FQSym. Also, there are two new involutions on FQSym, one of which corresponds to reversal, and the other to complement; which one depends on the basis. These are NOT restrictions of the analogous involutions of WQSym!

A later ticket, #25541, will implement similar involutions on FSym.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Frédéric, I wanted to let you know that my previous commit is a fix for the long tests on this ticket.

Also for the new test, here is the top of a `%prun`:

```

So about 1/2 of the time is spent just checking that two permutations are equal.
