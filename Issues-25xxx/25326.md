This ticket implements the projection of combinatorial Hopf algebras FQSym -> QSym, a more efficient transition from the M to the F basis on FQSym (using the Möbius function of the weak order on the symmetric groups), and certain involutions of the combinatorial Hopf algebras WQSym and FQSym:

On WQSym:

- The one that, in the M-basis, reverses the ordered set partition, or equivalently complements the packed word (i.e., replaces letters 1,2,...,k by k,k-1,...,1). This is an automorphism of the algebra structure and an anti-automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The one that, in the M-basis, complements the (elements of the blocks of the) ordered set partition, or equivalently reverts the packed word. This is an anti-automorphism of the algebra structure (which is obvious if you look at WQSym as a subring of formal power series in non-commutative variables: then it's just a restriction of the anti-automorphism that fixes each letter) and an automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The composition of the above two. This is best called the star involution or the Schützenberger anti-automorphism, and is an anti-automorphism of the whole Hopf algebra. Note that this involution restricts to the `star_involution` method of NSym. (The previous two involutions don't restrict to any linear endomorphisms of NSym at all, so we have no caselaw telling us how to call them.)

On FQSym:

The star involution above restricts to FQSym. Also, there are two new involutions on FQSym, one of which corresponds to reversal, and the other to complement; which one depends on the basis. These are NOT restrictions of the analogous involutions of WQSym!

A later ticket, #25541, will implement similar involutions on FSym.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I've implemented an explicit M-to-F transition matrix for FQSym as well, as was suggested in one of the TODOs. This speeds up computations for all but the simplest cases (warning: these times are on Cygwin):

Before:

```
sage: FQSym = algebras.FQSym(ZZ); FQSym.inject_shorthands()
Defining F as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the F basis
Defining G as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the G basis
Defining M as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the Monomial basis
sage: %timeit F(M[3,2,1])
10000 loops, best of 3: 88.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 489 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[2,1,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 214 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1])
The slowest run took 4.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 81 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3,4])
100 loops, best of 3: 2.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[4,2,1,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 220 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[6,2,5,1,3,4])
100 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ms per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[8,3,2,1,4,5,6,7])
1 loop, best of 3: 1.66 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: FQSym = algebras.FQSym(ZZ); FQSym.inject_shorthands()
Defining F as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the F basis
Defining G as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the G basis
Defining M as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the Monomial basis
sage: %timeit F(M[3,2,1])
10000 loops, best of 3: 196 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 243 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[2,1,3])
10000 loops, best of 3: 191 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1])
10000 loops, best of 3: 136 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3,4])
1000 loops, best of 3: 382 µs per loop

sage: %timeit F(M[6,2,5,1,3,4])
1000 loops, best of 3: 281 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[8,3,2,1,4,5,6,7])
1000 loops, best of 3: 776 µs per loop
