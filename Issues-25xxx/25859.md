I thought I did make this change in an earlier ticket, but maybe that ticket hasn't been merged yet, and now I can't find reference to it.

For "old-style" package installations that don't have a file manifest, it doesn't make sense to run `sage-spkg-uninstall` *after* running its `spkg-install`, since that can have the effect of *removing* files from `$SAGE_LOCAL` that were just installed.

It also makes sense to uninstall first even for "new-style" packages, since some packages don't build correctly unless the previous version of that package is removed first (e.g. Python).  See the commit message for more details.
