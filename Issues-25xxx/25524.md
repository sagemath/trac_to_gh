```
1. faster creation of new Laurent polynomial via a `cdef _new_c` method
2. Make rich comparison compatible with polynomials
3. make Laurent polynomial complient with coercion for `/` so that the result is always a rational fration.
4. allow construction of Laurent polynomial from rational fraction

As a consequence of 2 and 3, many doctests had to be corrected in `sage/algebras/`.

I disagree with `1/x` not being a Laurent polynomial (and I think by extension `~x`). This is far too common for people to do and then have to deal with rational functions for something that looks like a Laurent polynomial. IIRC, there were some sage-devel discussions on this. If you do want to make this change, then you need to ask on sage-devel.

I would also appreciate it if you could put back in the linebreaks on the long outputs.

The `_new_c` also does not mitigate the subclass issue. In fact, it makes it worse if I want to do a Python subclass as I now have no way to override `_new_c` used in those other methods. I would instead use

```sage
cdef type t = type(self)
cdef LaurentPolynomial_univariate p = t.__new__(t)
```
following `sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.PermutationGroupElement._new_c`.

People are familiar with integers and

```
sage: parent(1 / 1)
Rational Field
```
Here `1 / 1` looks like an integer. Also people are more familiar with polynomials rather than Laurent polynomials and

```
sage: R = QQ['x']
sage: parent(R.one() / R.one())
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
Still `R.one() / R.one()` looks like an integer.

> IIRC, there were some sage-devel discussions on this. If you do want to make this change, then you need to ask on sage-devel.

I am willing to ask on sage-devel as the current situation is a bug with respect to

    The parent of `a / b` should only depend on the parent of `a` and `b`.

I can imagine two alternatives
1. Allow `a / b` only when `b` is invertible which is what you seem to suggest. As a consequence `1 / (1 + q)` will raise an error and one would have to explicitely convert to the fraction field to make it work.
2. Make `a / b` always return a rational fraction. This is the behavior of all parents in Sage (or at least integers and polynomials). This is also what I proposed in the current branch.

This I can do. The changes in output look ok? They seem to come from the change in ordering for Laurent polynomials.

I have to investigate how Cython is optimizing this.

The problem with this argument is methods. Elements of `ZZ` and `QQ` have nearly identical methods so ducktyping will work between the two. However, this is a very different story for (Laurent) polynomials versus rational functions, in part because the latter is very generic. (I think part of the reason why we use the fraction field of the polynomial ring is so there is less ambiguity with things like 1/x versus x<sup>-1</sup>.)

That is not what I am proposing. I am proposing keeping the current behavior: a special case for monomials in a Laurent polynomial ring.

Thank you. Yes, I do as they are behaving the same as polynomials, in particular, `-x < 0` is now consistent. (IMO, having something like `X + (-q^2)*Y` is a bit ugly, but that is a separate issue.)

Ducktyping is dangerous

```
sage: 3.is_unit()
False
sage: (3/1).is_unit()
True
```

Moreover, having Laurent polynomials behaving in a different way that any other element in Sage is not helping users. They would better learn that `a / b` has a parent that only depends on `parent(a)` and `parent(b)` and not parent by parent special cases.

This is the worse thing ever. If I write

```
def my_function(a, b):
    c = a / b
    ... # furter work with c
```
then depending on whether `b` is a monomial or not I will end up with different objects for `c`. It is much safer to have predictible output.

That is misleading IMO because it is asking two different questions because of the parent. However, I agree that ducktyping for everything does not work, but for most cases, it is fine (e.g., `range(4/2)`).

I agree that this is a good general principle, but having such a hard rule will likely turn users away because of the unexpected behaviors. It also forces people to write code that will have logic bugs that are harder to find and detect than errors that will be raised during computations.
