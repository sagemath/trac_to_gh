When working in a number field, converting back and forth between elements of the (S) unit group and their values in the number fields does not necessarily give the same element back. Here is a toy example

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(-3).composite_fields(QuadraticField(2))[0]
sage: U = K.unit_group()
sage: [(u, U(K(u))) for u in U.gens()]
[(u0, u0^5), (u1, u1)]
sage: US = K.S_unit_group(3)
sage: [(u, U(K(u))) for u in U.gens()]
[(u0, u0^5), (u1, u1)]
```

This problem does not seem to occur for simple number fields and only causes a problem on the torsion part of the unit group.

Looking into the code it seems that the cause of this problem is that the conversion from the number field to the unit group uses the  pari conversion, which considers a (possibly) different torsion generator then the one picked by sage when the unit group is initialized.

Looking into the pari documentation, pari seems to use bnf.tu (an element stored in the pari number field data object) to convert to the unit group, whilst sage uses the pari function nfrootsof1 to initialize the value of the fundamental unit.

Keywords: **number field unit group conversion**
