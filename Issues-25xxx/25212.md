For some reason that I don't yet understand, on the main develop branch of Sage, the doctest runner is not complaining about this test even though it's syntactically malformatted.  Whereas on my Python 3 branch it is correctly reported as a syntax error.

It's not, nor do I think you're correctly interpreting the purpose of the test.

I think the issue is this: `cython_compile` injects its result directly into the actual global namespace (`user_globals`).  `get_test_shell()` meanwhile implements a fake IPython shell for testing features thereof, ~~but takes care not to modify the actual global namespace~~ this appears to not exactly be true, but there's still something going on with how `cython_compile()` uses `user_globals`, and similarly with fortran I think.

That said, all the test is testing in this case is that `%%cython` magic works, like, syntactically.  So I think it's beside the point.

Ok, I take it back.  It seems like this does work at the command-line, but it does not work correctly in the doctests themselves.  So there's a weird interaction between the doctest runner, the test shell, and user_globals. 

I think that problem must have existed for a while though considering that

a) This test was already broken for a long time but not being run.

and

b) The other similar test in this module seems to already be working around the same issue.
