Example:

```
sage: G32=GU(3,2)
sage: g1, g2 =G32.gens()
sage: g1.matrix().is_unitary()
False
```

The consequence of this is that the matrix cannot be coerced back to the group:

```
sage: G32(g1.matrix())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be unitary
```

Thank you Sebastian. Just keep cc-ing me on tickets to help get your cubic braid groups code into Sage (and/or emailing me if you have any questions).

Thanks Frédéric for catching that; mea culpa. Trivial fix so I am allowing myself to set back to a positive review.

It was my fault, as well. I run a doctest yesterday evening and I saw "all tests passed", but probably in the wrong window!

Concerning the cubic braid group there is just one unreviewed ticket left (#25894) for the moment. But I will soon produce some new ones an cc you on them!
Thanks for offering your help!
