There are lots of sorting issues in `sage/homology` – the code intentionally tries to sort almost everything, so as to get consistent matrices for boundary maps, etc. This naturally leads to problems with Python 3, because not only does it not want to sort everything, but in cases where sorting was not done explicitly (for a `set`, for example), the default sorting is different between Python 2 and Python 3. I've added a few general fixes for sorting and I've fixed the infinite recursion with `delta_complex.py`. I now get no doctest failures for `cell_complex.py` and `delta_complex.py`.
