There's been some discussion about using pyflakes to catch coding errors in the Sage library. I tried it out on `sage/modular`. It caught the following issues:
- lots of unnecessary imports;
- lots of variables assigned but never used;
- a few code snippets which couldn't possibly have worked, as the variables weren't defined (but which was apparently never spotted or tested).

Here's a branch which fixes these.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A3):
> how is it possible to merely delete `character()`, without deprecating etc?

There were two definitions of the method "character" in that class (with identical code, but slightly different doctests), one overwriting the other. So I removed the duplicate and merged its docstring with the other. No functionality was changed.
