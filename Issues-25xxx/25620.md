The *only* difference (and I had to stare a while to see this) was in the sort order of the last 2 roots:

```
     [5.625452776105595 +/- 2.29e-16] + [17.31459450084417 +/- 4.09e-15]*I,
     [5.625452776105595 +/- 2.29e-16] + [-17.31459450084417 +/- 4.09e-15]*I
```

vs

```
[5.625452776105595 +/- 2.29e-16] + [-17.31459450084417 +/- 4.09e-15]*I,
[5.625452776105595 +/- 2.29e-16] + [17.31459450084417 +/- 4.09e-15]*I
```

where the only difference between the two is the sign on the complex part.

This failure, unsurprisingly, appears to be a possible problem with
arb; specifically the function _arb_vec_sort_pretty:
https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/blob/f4dda0f34f30cb8cbfe3b18eafc9e5e8480a88da/acb/vec_sort_pretty.c#L48

I'm not sure why it only appears to be affecting me on Cygwin...

qsort() is not guaranteed to be a stable sort. I guess the two roots compare equal under arb's comparison function, and the qsort() implementations don't sort them in the same order.

Fredrik, assuming this is correct, would it make sense to use a total order in vec_cort_pretty()? Or should we work around the issue in sage?

I believe any failing test or regression should be considered a blocker.  How can you guarantee useful continuous integration tests if every run fails?  Do I have to check the test results every time to see if something other than a known failure failed?
