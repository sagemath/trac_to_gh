Motivated by [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24551#comment:8), this removes some needless explicit `__eq__` and `__ne__` implementations from some classes in `sage.algebras` that subclass (directly or indirectly) `UniqueRepresentation`.

This also fixes problems with these classes on Python w.r.t. #24551.  There are likely other cases like this but I'm just looking one top-level sub-package at a time...

Very high priority should be given to handling the hash problem in sage/manifold.

Because issues there create a lot of errors in doc-building :

I have temporary fixes to most of those in my python3 branch.  But I'd like to take another look if any of those fall into a similar category as this ticket.
