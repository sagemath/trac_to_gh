Currently factorization code ignores the proof flag for polynomials:

```
sage: k.<u> = GF(4)
sage: R.<v> = k[]
sage: l.<v> = R.quo(v^3 + v + 1)
sage: R.<x,y> = l[]
sage: f = y^3 + x^3 + (u + 1)*x
sage: with proof.WithProof('polynomial', True):
....:     f.factor()
NotImplementedError: "proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False."
sage: with proof.WithProof('polynomial', False):
....:     f.factor()
NotImplementedError: "proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False."
```
