[ -f bin/gap.sh ] || sdh_die "Error building GAP ('gap.sh' not found)."

You have a commit message `turns out bin/gap.sh is a symlink to either gap-default64.sh or gap-default32.sh (only one or the other should exist). rather than add explicit support for dereferencing symlinks, for now just copy the real file`. I would rather see something like that in a comment in the script, otherwise it's quite obscure what `sdh_install -T bin/gap-default*.sh "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap"` does.

Given that we have `sage-legacy-uninstall`, shouldn't this be moved there?

```
rm -rf "$INSTALL_DIR"
rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest"
rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gap"
```
(just a question, if there is a good reason to keep it there: fine for me)

Yes, this ticket just predates that being merged; as long as this is still open it makes sense to go ahead and move that stuff into an spkg-legacy-uninstall.
