Use Cython cname declarations to use unprefixed libGAP names in Sage. The libGAP package is not changed at all, only the Sage interface.

Obvious exceptions:

- `libGAP_True`
- `libGAP_False`

The only `libGAP_` things left are `libGAP_True/False`. There are also `libgap_`-things, but this is another story. The docs about `libGAP_` ought to be more explicit about this.

Changing API should not be tricky if you add a compatibility layer changing the new names to the old names. My proposal should literally be 100% API-compatible for GAP packages.

> Are there any name clashes in exported symbols in their new libgap-API?

I haven't tried the new libgap-API, so I cannot tell. But it's not only about exported symbols, it's about anything defined in the GAP header files. In particular `T_INT` is problematic that way (assuming that it still exists in the new libgap-API).

First of all, I'd consider that very bad style. For example, what if GAP suddenly decided to change the value of `T_INT`?

Second, the question is not whether `T_INT` is *used*. The question is whether it's defined in a header file.

`T_INT` won't change "suddenly", for sure, as these `T_*` things are heavily used in GAP's low-level type system.

As I said, as I didn't understand the problem fully (and still don't), I wasn't able to convince GAP devs that something needs to be done about it.

The problem is that the Python header `structmember.h` file also does

```
#define T_INT       1
```

You can hope that the GAP headers won't be included after that Python header, but that seems dangerous to me especially because we cannot really control the code that Cython generates.

If GAP's headers are included after Python's, you'd get a compilation error. Indeed

```
#include <stdio.h>
#define T_INT 42
enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
int main(){
    int i;
    i = T_INT;
    printf("%d\n", i);
    return 0;}
```
and

```
$ gcc t.c 
t.c:2:15: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
 #define T_INT 42
               ^~
t.c:3:13: note: in expansion of macro ‘T_INT’
 enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
             ^~~~~
```

But if you swap the inclusion order, then yes, everything compiles, and overrides the enum. Indeed

```
#include <stdio.h>
enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
#define T_INT 42
int main(){
    int i;
    i = T_INT;
    printf("%d\n", i);
    return 0;}
```
compiles and outputs 42.

Not sure whether and how this could affect libgap...

I'd be more concerned about Python's `#define` shadowing `T_INT`: a compilation error is much easier to deal with than a vague runtime one...

I'd also say that here Python is the bad guy, not using `enum` for its `T_*` constants.
