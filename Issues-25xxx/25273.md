Obvious exceptions:

- `libGAP_True`
- `libGAP_False`

In libgap.pyx you have

The ``foobar`` methods are
the original GAP methods simply prefixed with the string

```
which looks like an artefact of non-interactive editing...

I presume there is no prefix any more.

Changing API should not be tricky if you add a compatibility layer changing the new names to the old names. My proposal should literally be 100% API-compatible for GAP packages.

> Are there any name clashes in exported symbols in their new libgap-API?

I haven't tried the new libgap-API, so I cannot tell. But it's not only about exported symbols, it's about anything defined in the GAP header files. In particular `T_INT` is problematic that way (assuming that it still exists in the new libgap-API).

`T_INT` won't change "suddenly", for sure, as these `T_*` things are heavily used in GAP's low-level type system.

As I said, as I didn't understand the problem fully (and still don't), I wasn't able to convince GAP devs that something needs to be done about it.

For the record, in GAP `T_INT` is a part of  `enum` type `TNUM` in `src/objects.h`, i.e. one sees there 

```
enum TNUM {

The problem is that the Python header `structmember.h` file also does

```
#define T_INT       1
```

You can hope that the GAP headers won't be included after that Python header, but that seems dangerous to me especially because we cannot really control the code that Cython generates.

If GAP's headers are included after Python's, you'd get a compilation error. Indeed

```
#include <stdio.h>
#define T_INT 42
enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
int main(){
    int i;
    i = T_INT;
    printf("%d\n", i);
    return 0;}
```
and

```
$ gcc t.c 
t.c:2:15: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
 #define T_INT 42
               ^~
t.c:3:13: note: in expansion of macro ‘T_INT’
 enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
             ^~~~~
```

But if you swap the inclusion order, then yes, everything compiles, and overrides the enum. Indeed

```
#include <stdio.h>
enum TNUM { T_INT, T_FOO };
#define T_INT 42
int main(){
    int i;
    i = T_INT;
    printf("%d\n", i);
    return 0;}
```
compiles and outputs 42.

Not sure whether and how this could affect libgap...

I'd be more concerned about Python's `#define` shadowing `T_INT`: a compilation error is much easier to deal with than a vague runtime one...

I'd also say that here Python is the bad guy, not using `enum` for its `T_*` constants.
(I'd say it should rather be using `enum`, no?)
