<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi Johan,

With a master student of mine (Amaury Durand), we generalized the notion of Gabidulin codes to any Ore algebra (possibly with derivation) and managed to allow more evaluation points. We are preparing a paper now and we trying to implement our generalized Gabidulin codes in Sage.

This ticket implements derivations and theta-derivations over arbitrary commutative rings. It is a first step towards implementing our generalized Gabidulin.

Hi Xavier and Amaury,

This looks very promising. I have no experience with theta-derivations over arbitrary commutative rings, but you code seems to explain the definition nicely. I should be able to review the code in the not-too-far-future. I'd like to see a preprint of your paper (if you prefer, in private email), if some of it is ready for consumption, and if you believe it would help my reading of the code.

Best,
Johan

<a id='comment:16'></a>This is a good advancement and looks in good shape. I have a few comments and suggestions.

The set of all derivations forms a Lie algebra with `[X, Y] = X*Y - Y*X`, which Sage has support for. So for untwisted derivations, it should be in the category of `LieAlgebras`. Let me know if you have any questions about adding this. (The twisted derivations forms what is known as a hom-Lie algebra, where the Jacobi relation also needs to be twisted.)

Additionally, when the ring is a finite-dimensional algebra with an explicit basis, we can compute a basis for the derivation module in terms of matrices:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: E.derivations_basis()
(
[0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]  [0 0 1 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 1 0 0]  [0 0 1 0]  [0 0 0 0]  [0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 1], [0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 1], [0 1 0 0], [0 0 1 0]
)
```
Although incorporating that is something that could easily be on a followup ticket as it will likely require a bit of extending your current implementation.

A few quick comments from reading the browsing the code:

- You should not set `self.element_class` attribute, but instead set `self.Element` (the `Parent.__init__` ends up creating the new subclass `element_class` using stuff from the category).
- Python convention is error messages do not start with a capital letter.
- Remove the first `::` here:
  {{{
::

Twisted derivations and handled similarly::
  }}}
- `Returns` -> `Return`.
- ```n``th` -> ```n``-th` as otherwise it does not get parsed correctly.
- ```n`` - an integer (default: ``0``)` -> `-``n`` -- integer (default: ``0``)`
- It might actually be good to have `RingDerivation` still inherit from `(Ring)Map` as the composition just becomes a formal composition of maps in the homspace (IIRC the default behavior). Plus it allows for natural functionality.
- I think it would be better to remove `derivation_twisted` and just have an extra input to `derivation`. It will have better localization of code and documentation and match the semantic of `derivation_module`.

It will have better localization of code and documentation and match the semantic of `derivation_module`.\n\n\nThe semantic of `derivation` is a bit different from that of `derivation_twisted`. It's the reason why I've implemented two distinct methods.\n\nBy the way, I just realized that my current code works almost only for polynomial algebras.

Good point.
I'll add it. (I think I can do it by myself but I'll ask you if I have questions.)

Are there support in Sage for hom-Lie algebras?

Ah, OK.

Really? Is it the Sage convention as well?
I ask the question because I remember that, one time, somebody told me that I should capitalize my error messages.

Actually, I already tried to inherit from `RingMap` but had some troubles. But I can try harder :-)

The semantic of `derivation` is a bit different from that of `derivation_twisted`. It's the reason why I've implemented two distinct methods.

By the way, I just realized that my current code works almost only for polynomial algebras. In particular, it does not work for quotients of polynomial algebras: `d/dx` does not define a derivation over `A[x]/P(x)` but it does define a derivation from `A[x]/P(x)` to `A[x]/(P(x),P'(x))`. I don't know what is the best way to fix this: I can certainly move the method `derivation` to the classes `PolynomialRing_general`, `MPolynomialRing_base` and `FractionField_generic`) but this implies code duplication. Otherwise, I can leave it in the class `Ring` but check if `self` is an instance of those classes. I don't know if it's a good practice.

Somewhat, but it feels a little artificial. You could just have a keyword only argument of `twist`, which I feel is quite natural to have. However, I don't feel that strongly about it, so if you would rather keep the current constructs, then it is fine by me.

I feel like it should work with quotients: If a map is a derivation in the ambient space, so when taking the quotient (which is functorial), you are preserving the equality. Perhaps I am over-simplifying things. I am guessing you have an explicit example in mind?

Well, if `A = B (mod P)`, we can write `A = B + PQ` and taking the derivative, one gets `A' = B' + P'Q + PQ'` meaning that `A' = B' (mod (P,P'))` but in general `A' != B' (mod P)`.

For a concrete example, take `P = X^n` and observe that the derivative of a polynomial defined modulo `X^n` is a polynomial defined modulo `X^(n-1)` (basically, we shift coefficients).

You are not doing a new `__eq__`/`__richcmp__`, so there should not be a need to do this.

I think there is something we should be careful about in the module doc. If `A` is not a commutative ring, then `B` needs to be an `A`-bimodule (not necessarily an algebra) to be a derivation. However, there is a left and a right action of `A` on `B` used in the definition. (With the code itself, this is not a problem because you enforce `A` to be commutative.)

I feel like, at least for ease of maintenance, it would be better for `basis` to return `self._basis` even if it is `_gens`. It helps keep these as separate constructs and allows us later to take a larger generator set and then reduce it to a basis.

You need to add `derivation.py` to the documentation.

Replace `_cmp_` with `_richcmp_` as this will make it Python3 compatible.

It is better to use

```diff
-self.parent().codomain()(0)
+self.parent().codomain().zero()
```
since the latter is cached and avoids coercion/conversion.

I think your elements need to implement a `monomial_coefficients()` method, where the output is a `dict` whose keys are the basis indices and the values are the corresponding coefficients.

I think `(dual_)basis` should return a `Family` (or a `Sequence`, but this has a more limited feature set) to be consistent with other parts of Sage in `ModulesWithBasis`.

Every `__init__` should have a `TestSuite(foo).run()` call. This is usually a good way to catch bugs and implementation requirements from the category.

I think a better `__hash__` test would be

```
sage: hash(M) == hash((M.domain(), M.codomain(), M.twisting_morphism())
True
```
as it shows that the hash works and what it should be equal to.

```diff
-``n`` - an integer (default: ``0``)
+-``n`` -- an integer (default: ``0``)
```

Instead of `self(x)`, why not do `self.element_class(self, x)`? Granted, it is not going to make a big difference in speed, but I think it is a little better because it is more direct.

In the same vein, for the arithmetic operations, it is faster to do, e.g.,

```diff
-return self.parent()(self._scalar - other._scalar)
+return type(self)(self.parent(), self._scalar - other._scalar)
```

Why all the same definition of `__hash__`? You are not doing a new `__eq__`/`__richcmp__`, so there should not be a need to do this. Why not have this be in the ABC and override when you need to?

General question, how much speed do you think you need with these elements? It might be worthwhile to consider Cythonizing the elements.

What do you propose concretely?
I can add a doctest demonstrating that derivations are not supported over noncommutative rings. How does it sound?

Sure!

It seems that you must have to redefine `__hash__` in each class even if the code does not change (otherwise I got an error). I don't know why.

For now, I'm not that concerned with speed. But on the other hand, I'm aware that my code is rather slow (especially for iteration polynomial rings). I will probably (one day) consider Cythonizing derivations but, except if you strongly disagree, it will be for another ticket.

I don't think it needs a doctest since for the actual implementation you say commutative ring. I think it is sufficient to just replace "algebra over `A`" with "`A`-bimodule" in the top-level docstring.

It might be worthwhile mentioning somewhere (maybe `RingDerivationModule`, but maybe elsewhere) that when `B = A`, then the set of (twisted) derivations has a (hom-)Lie algebra structure. However, I am bias because I like Lie algebras. :)

Yes, that is what was missing.

No, you shouldn't. In fact, that is once of the nice things about `_richcmp_` is you do not need other comparisons. You can just return a `NotImplemented`. Although, you could just do

```
from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp  # put this import at the top level
return richcmp(self.list(), other.list(), op)
```

Thank you. This also makes it so `self.basis().cardinality()` and `self.basis().keys()` works and helps make things uniform.

That is very strange. I would figure it would be sufficient for some ABC. I might have to look more closely into that.

Another ticket is fine. It is slightly easier to split the element class into a Cython file here than on a separate ticket, but only slightly. I am fine with whatever you decide.
