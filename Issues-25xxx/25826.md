<a id='comment:6'></a>A while-we-are-changing-it thing:

```
        Return the image of ``self`` under the delta morphism.

        The delta morphism, also known as the run-length encoding,
        is the word composed of the length of consecutive runs of
        the same letter in a given word.
```
Note also `lenght` -> `length` typo in the current version.
