In the documentation of the method delta() available in combinat/words/finite_word, I'm adding a note mentioning that it is also known as the "run-length encoding" of a word. This notion was introduced in the 1950s.

<a id='comment:6'></a>A while-we-are-changing-it thing:

```
        Return the image of ``self`` under the delta morphism.

        The delta morphism, also known as the run-length encoding,
        is the word composed of the length of consecutive runs of
        the same letter in a given word.
```
Note also `lenght` -> `length` typo in the current version.
