OK, so let's work on the "public" branch, so that we both can push into the same place.

I've edited a part of the goppa.py file, in particular using 

```
stuff like `u` - for maths (LaTeX)

stuff like ``self`` for Python variables etc
```

Please fix the rest of it, as well as things marked by `???`.

Then, for functions and classes the 1st line of the multilibe doctring has a special
meaning, it should be short, and followed by an empty line (for indexing).

I probably fixed all of the latter already.

To see my chnages, check out the branch and do `git diff HEAD^ -w` (`-w` is needed to ignore whitespace changes, as I converted the file to the Unix format...)


As well, please try building Sage docs with these changes - it's important that all the
spaces are at the right places, as `rst` is a tricky forrmat...
