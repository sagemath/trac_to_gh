This ticket fixes the 34 doctest failures that happen when internet is enabled, see [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/l635YEuT7Hs/WkHCnmWhAQAJ).

There are 3 kinds or errors:

- the oeis database gets updated with new data (this is a normal update),
- the oeis database changed its internal format, and does not make difference between signed and unsigned sequences anymore (in particular, for signed sequences, the `V,W,X` fields disapear, and are replaced with the `S,T,U` fields),
- the warnings triggered when a dead sequence is met were not correctly doctested.

The 3 commits corresponds to these 3 kind of errors

To test the branch:

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/databases/oeis.py 
```

Hi,

i will be on this (some might be tricky, e.g. related to dead sequences).

You write:

> Note that, as Sloane writes this week on the ​arxiv, the oeis is a now a Wiki which means that Sage doctests should depend as few as possible on the many modifications done on the OEIS database... 

Are you suggesting to parse the wiki ???

Note that the issue of the database changing was discussed in previous tickets. Still, we should show part of the answers for having meaningful examples (not only for testing purpose, but also for the user).
