The function intervalproducts in hypellfrob will be useful for other similar applications.
This ticket wraps that function for the rest of sage, it is necessary to have some basic functionality for ntl's mat_ZZ_p for this.

Do you really need this hack?

```
ZZ_p_c (*get "operator()") (long i, long j)

Cython should understand `operator()` just fine.

I should say I am a cython noob, so the answer to all such questions is going to be no! Thanks for telling me, I just copy what is there already for the most part to get something working.
I'll try and get rid of it.

The NTL interface is probably the worst Cython code in Sage, so that's not a good recommendation.

Even this is dubious:

```
cdef cppclass mat_ZZ_p_c "mat_ZZ_p"
```
I would just keep the `mat_ZZ_p` name, no need to append `_c` (and if you do change the name, it might be to make it clear that it comes from NTL, so `NTL_mat_ZZ_p` would make more sense).

Sure I've definitely got that impression, looking at the linbox stuff in comparison say.
But as I need ntl functionality I have to either dedicate serious time to understanding cython and fixing everything, or just add new code that is hopefully no worse than the existing, and somewhat consistent with the existing at that.
I do appreciate the comments though.

<a id='comment:9'></a>
Avoid the iteration syntax `0 <= k < numintervals`, Cython understands `range()`.

The existing NTL code also has a tendency to over-use pointers. For example, in `interval_products` I see no reason for

```
cdef mat_ZZ_p_c * out = new mat_ZZ_p_c()
```
You might as well use

```
cdef mat_ZZ_p_c out
```
and replace `out[0]` by `out` in the rest of the code (and remove `del out`). The same for `mm0` and `mm1`: `new_ntl_matrix_modn_dense` doesn't need to allocate a new matrix, it might as well fill in an existing matrix.

> Cython should understand `operator()` just fine.

Without it, it didn't seem to _just work_ as I expected i.e. calling `out(i,j)` C++ style, I have replaced it with the (less horrific)

```
        ZZ_p_c get(long i, long j)
```
though.

I would argue that the time you spend learning Cython is much better spend than trying to understand the Sage <-> NTL wrappers. I'm not kidding when I said that it's probably the worst Cython code in all of Sage.

More precisely, you don't need `new_ntl_matrix_modn_dense` at all: just move the line `A.SetDims(m._nrows, m._ncols)` to `set_ntl_matrix_modn_dense` and call that with an existing matrix like

```
cdef mat_ZZ_p_c mm

set_ntl_matrix_modn_dense(mm, ...)
```

You are right, my mistake, I had the wrong syntax in types.pxd, I suppose I prefer `get` in this context anyway I guess as its 0 indexed rather than 1 indexed but operator does work.
