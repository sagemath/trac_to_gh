If `islice` doesn't support [PEP 357](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0357/), shouldn't that be considered an upstream Python bug?

I think we should at least try to get that fixed upstream instead.

`islice` is actually fixed in Python 3.7: https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html#itertools

The plan is to release Python 3.7 on 27 june. So if we can just wait 10 days, there will be no reason for the workaround.
