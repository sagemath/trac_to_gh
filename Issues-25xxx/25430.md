I tried to obtain a `Set` of all natural numbers. One close method was to call `PositiveIntegers()`, which is not a `Set` (but something else which I could not understand), but may be coerced into `Set`.  This does not contain 0, so I used `Set(PositiveIntegers()).union(Set([0]))`.  The output is called `Set-theoretic union of Set of elements of Positive integers and {0}`, instead of the more readable `Set of all nonnegative integers`, but this is not the main issue I raise here.

One simpler way to obtain a set of all integers is by using `Set(ZZ)`, which creates a `Set` from the ring.  Apparently, one cannot achieve the set of natural numbers in a similar fashion: `Set(NN)` simply hangs, instead of creating a `Set` from the semiring.

Tested on 8.2.rc4.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

My guess with `NN` is that it is an issue with unresolved lazy imports (#16522, #14357):

```
sage: Set(NonNegativeIntegerSemiring())
Set of elements of Non negative integer semiring
sage: Set(NonNegativeIntegers())
Set of elements of Non negative integers

sage: type(NN)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: NN == NonNegativeIntegerSemiring()
True
sage: NN is NonNegativeIntegerSemiring()
False
sage: NonNegativeIntegerSemiring() == NonNegativeIntegers()
False
```
So you can get a set of non-negative integers, but `NN` is just specifically broken due to a lazy import issue.
