This fixes two doctest failures with Python 3 in `src/sage/algebras/steenrod/`. 

This is a little progress, but there is a third failure which I do not understand:

I thought that the coercion framework would allow Sage to compute the product `a * A(a)`. (The setup here is that `A` is a graded algebra, `a` is an element in a homogeneous component of it, so `a` is not an element of `A`. `A(a)` lives in `A` and so `A(a) * A(a)` makes sense. But both `A(a) * a` and `a * A(a)` should also make sense.)
