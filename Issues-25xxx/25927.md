This fixes two doctest failures with Python 3 in `src/sage/algebras/steenrod/`. 

This is a little progress, but there is a third failure which I do not understand:

thanks for trying to help.

In the change

```
sorted(list(A[5].basis()))
```
you can remove list and just use sorted. Once done, you can set to positive

By the way, for another ticket, there is with python3 a very annoying issue in these files

```
Killing test src/sage/homology/cell_complex.py

that involve an infinite recursion error.
