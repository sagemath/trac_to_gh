There are two problems with `Matrix_gfpn_dense.rescale_row_c`:
1. The optional argument `start_col` is not supported - see also #25476.
2. It is assumed that the field and the row size (which are global variables in MeatAxe) are correctly assigned to, but this assumption is easily violated:

```
sage: K.<x> = GF(25)
sage: L.<y> = GF(81)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K,1,25)(sorted(list(K)))
sage: N = MatrixSpace(L,5,5)(sorted(list(L))[:25])
sage: M.rescale_row(0,2)
sage: M
[      0       2       1   x + 1   x + 3       x   x + 1   x + 2   x + 3   x + 4     2*x 2*x + 1 2*x + 2 2*x + 3 2*x + 4     3*x 3*x + 1 3*x + 2 3*x + 3 3*x + 4     4*x 4*x + 1 4*x + 2 4*x + 3 4*x + 4]
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K,1,25)(sorted(list(K)))
sage: M.rescale_row(0,2)
sage: M
[      0       2       4       1       3     2*x 2*x + 2 2*x + 4 2*x + 1 2*x + 3     4*x 4*x + 2 4*x + 4 4*x + 1 4*x + 3       x   x + 2   x + 4   x + 1   x + 3     3*x 3*x + 2 3*x + 4 3*x + 1 3*x + 3]
```
So, in the first part of the example, creation of `N` makes MeatAxe believe that the current row size is 5 and the field has 81 elements, and therefore rescaling `M` is doomed.

Right, setting the field twice is a mistake.

> Also, have you noticed a speed regression by not doing it purely in MeatAxe? In particular, I am wondering if it might be worthwhile to patch MeatAxe instead of implementing it in Sage.


Patching wouldn't be needed, as I am upstream for SharedMeatAxe. But I don't expect that it would be really worth-while in terms of speed. In the end, both approaches yield more or less the same C code.

It just seems to me everything I look into the Cython generated C code, it seems like there could be a bit of overhead (and this might be something the library might benefit from having internally). However, I am content with the current state here (modulo the double set).

I am just referring to some of the unnecessary extra variables that are used or extra error checks. For instance, things like

```c
  /* "sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx":244
 *     if isinstance(g, Permutation):
 *         return g.cycle_tuples()
 *     if isinstance(g, PermutationGroupElement):             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *         g = g.cycle_tuples()
 *     if isinstance(g, str):
 */
  __pyx_t_3 = __Pyx_TypeCheck(__pyx_v_g, __pyx_ptype_4sage_6groups_8perm_gps_17permgroup_element_PermutationGroupElement); 
  __pyx_t_4 = (__pyx_t_3 != 0);
  if (__pyx_t_4) {
```
Granted, I suspect the compiler will optimize `__pyx_t_3` and `__pyx_t_4` away, but I still wonder if takes up a few extra CPU cycles, which multiplied by times they occur could result in faster code.

<a id='comment:17'></a>I should make it clear I do not have any concrete example where I could write C code that would be definitely faster than Cython's version. Although I have not currently tried such a comparison.

<a id='comment:18'></a>From looking at the C code of the added here, the Cython really should not have any real overhead.

I just removed the duplicate mentioned above. I suppose the proper thing is to have someone else check this rather than simply setting it to a positive review.

I'm pretty sure that this is the case indeed. Recent compilers are very good at this.

Anyway, I thought that you were referring to "pure C" code in Cython. When Python objects are involved, there is always some overhead because of refcounting for example.

Only in a very small part. Although it is nice to see with proper typing for everything that it basically is a straight translation to C.

Are you only talking about commit:1a97f39? That's of course totally fine, FfSetField was called twice where it should only be called once.

So, if that's the only issue, it is "positive review".
