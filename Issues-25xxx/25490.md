There are two problems with `Matrix_gfpn_dense.rescale_row_c`:
1. The optional argument `start_col` is not supported - see also #25476.
2. It is assumed that the field and the row size (which are global variables in MeatAxe) are correctly assigned to, but this assumption is easily violated:

```
sage: K.<x> = GF(25)
sage: L.<y> = GF(81)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K,1,25)(sorted(list(K)))
sage: N = MatrixSpace(L,5,5)(sorted(list(L))[:25])
sage: M.rescale_row(0,2)
sage: M
[      0       2       1   x + 1   x + 3       x   x + 1   x + 2   x + 3   x + 4     2*x 2*x + 1 2*x + 2 2*x + 3 2*x + 4     3*x 3*x + 1 3*x + 2 3*x + 3 3*x + 4     4*x 4*x + 1 4*x + 2 4*x + 3 4*x + 4]
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K,1,25)(sorted(list(K)))
sage: M.rescale_row(0,2)
sage: M
[      0       2       4       1       3     2*x 2*x + 2 2*x + 4 2*x + 1 2*x + 3     4*x 4*x + 2 4*x + 4 4*x + 1 4*x + 3       x   x + 2   x + 4   x + 1   x + 3     3*x 3*x + 2 3*x + 4 3*x + 1 3*x + 3]
```
So, in the first part of the example, creation of `N` makes MeatAxe believe that the current row size is 5 and the field has 81 elements, and therefore rescaling `M` is doomed.

Right, setting the field twice is a mistake.

> Also, have you noticed a speed regression by not doing it purely in MeatAxe? In particular, I am wondering if it might be worthwhile to patch MeatAxe instead of implementing it in Sage.


Patching wouldn't be needed, as I am upstream for SharedMeatAxe. But I don't expect that it would be really worth-while in terms of speed. In the end, both approaches yield more or less the same C code.

It just seems to me everything I look into the Cython generated C code, it seems like there could be a bit of overhead (and this might be something the library might benefit from having internally). However, I am content with the current state here (modulo the double set).

If you have concrete examples of this, I'm sure that Cython upstream would be interested in fixing that.

I am just referring to some of the unnecessary extra variables that are used or extra error checks. For instance, things like

```c
  /* "sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx":244
 *     if isinstance(g, Permutation):
 *         return g.cycle_tuples()
 *     if isinstance(g, PermutationGroupElement):             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *         g = g.cycle_tuples()
 *     if isinstance(g, str):
 */
  __pyx_t_3 = __Pyx_TypeCheck(__pyx_v_g, __pyx_ptype_4sage_6groups_8perm_gps_17permgroup_element_PermutationGroupElement); 
  __pyx_t_4 = (__pyx_t_3 != 0);
  if (__pyx_t_4) {
```
Granted, I suspect the compiler will optimize `__pyx_t_3` and `__pyx_t_4` away, but I still wonder if takes up a few extra CPU cycles, which multiplied by times they occur could result in faster code.

I'm pretty sure that this is the case indeed. Recent compilers are very good at this.

Are you only talking about commit:1a97f39? That's of course totally fine, FfSetField was called twice where it should only be called once.
