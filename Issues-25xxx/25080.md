<a id='comment:3'></a>Fails with disconnected posets, see `posets.AntichainPoset(4).factorize()`. Works with the empty poset, but a test for the corner case would be nice.

Maybe this is the best name for this function; however, what will be the name for the converse of ordinal product?

I think that a factor of a lattice is always a lattice. Or is it? Got to think about this later.

E: Also, a test where the underlying undirected graph can be factorized, but the poset can not, would be nice.

For the name, my favorite choice would be just "factor". Other possibilies are "factor_cartesian" and "factor_ordinal" ; or maybe "cartesian_factor" and "ordinal_factor".

For the lattice property, I think this holds for the factors, and the same for MeetSemiLattice, etc. But I do not feel any need for that.

Maybe "factor" or "factorize" is good, as also plain "product" means the Cartesian product.

Is it really a `ValueError` to run this with unconnected posets? IMO it should be seen as a missing implementation, as an unconnected poset can be a Cartesian product of two posets.

I don't see how there could be parallel arrows when the graph is the Hasse diagram of some poset. However, almost all the time is spent in factoring undirected graph, so this makes no real difference.

Output type for lattices can be changed later.

There are some shortcuts that could be used: for example the numbers of minimal elements must not be a prime. Also the number of edges in the Hasse diagram can show that a poset can't be a Cartesian product etc. However, all this can also be added later.
