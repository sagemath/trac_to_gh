As recently reported in
[Ask Sage question 41763](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41763/problems-with-gauss-code-for-knots/),
the following raises an error:

```
sage: A = Link([[[1, 2, -2, -1, -3, -4, 4, 3]], [1, 1, 1, 1]])
sage: A.braid()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: [5, 8, 6, 1] is not in list
```

This affects many computations for this link:

```
A.alexander_polynomial()
A.braid()
A.determinant()
A.genus()
A.jones_polynomial()
A.seifert_matrix()
A.signature()
```
