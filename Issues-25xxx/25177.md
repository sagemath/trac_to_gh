```
When `sys.stderr` is not a file but some other stream, `cython()` breaks because of this redirection:

```
                with redirection(sys.stderr, errfile, close=False):
                    dist.run_command("build")
```

The goal is to redirect the actual OS-level stderr, so we should just use the file descriptor number `2` instead.
