You have removed the `_call_` method, so the docstring/test no longer applies.

Maybe there is a bug in lazy_import. It does not show the deprecation for me.
Can you reproduce it?

```
sage: G = GO(2,2,e=1)
sage: P = G.Hom(G)
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.morphism import MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
sage: MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens(P,G.gens())
Group endomorphism of General Orthogonal Group of degree 2 and form parameter 1 over Finite Field of size 2
```
If we do not use the class it works:

```
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.morphism import MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
sage: MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
.... DeprecationWarning: ....
```

Perhaps it is being resolved in some way and then the deprecation is getting suppressed? I'm not exactly sure, but this is the correct procedure.

We should also do the same for the `homset.py` file.
