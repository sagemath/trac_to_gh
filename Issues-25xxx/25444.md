This is a follow up to #24691.

Morphisms for matrix groups are a separate class which offers little functionality. They can be replaced by `libgap_morphism` which unifies matters and allows homomorphisms to other libgap groups.

You have removed the `_call_` method, so the docstring/test no longer applies.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Maybe there is a bug in lazy_import. It does not show the deprecation for me.
Can you reproduce it?

```
sage: G = GO(2,2,e=1)
sage: P = G.Hom(G)
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.morphism import MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
sage: MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens(P,G.gens())
Group endomorphism of General Orthogonal Group of degree 2 and form parameter 1 over Finite Field of size 2

If we do not use the class it works:

```
