This is a follow up to #24691.

Morphisms for matrix groups are a separate class which offers little functionality. They can be replaced by `libgap_morphism` which unifies matters and allows homomorphisms to other libgap groups.

Not sure what you mean here?

Good suggestion. I tend to be too quick about such things. I could remove the test entirely, but then the patchbot will complain about coverage going down?

You have removed the `_call_` method, so the docstring/test no longer applies.
