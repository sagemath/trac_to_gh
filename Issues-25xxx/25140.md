This is a followup to #25139 and represents work that was originally done in #22510 to convert most packages to use `spkg-legacy-uninstall` and remove uninstall-related commands from their `spkg-install` scripts.

This work was brought over from an older branch and still needs some adjustment: It should incorporate the changes from the #24024 metaticket which conflict with some of these changes.  There are also some additional optional and experimental packages (and maybe a couple standard packages) that still need to be updated as well.

Probably won't bother with that until and unless #25139 is approved of in some form that still includes the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` feature.

---

To summarize what this is about: Part of the goal in implementing the new installation/uninstallation system for packages is that `spkg-install` should, ideally, not modify `$SAGE_LOCAL` in any way, at least for packages that support `DESTDIR`-based installation.  This allows more separation from the building of packages from their runtime installation target.

However, many packages' `spkg-install` or `spkg-build` include commands (mostly in the form of `rm -rf`'s) to clean up files from previous installs of those packages.  This is no longer necessary for new-style package installations that track exactly what files are installed by a package.  But it is still necessary when upgrading from old installs of packages that don't have a file manifest.  This is what the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script is for.  It's just taking the `rm -rf`'s from `spkg-install` and moving it into a separate script that is called by the uninstaller if it doesn't have a file manifest for that package.

So this ticket is just creating the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` for many packages that already have `DESTDIR` support.

Added `spkg-legacy-uninstall` for a few packages that could use it.

This is now done for at least most, if not all packages that have DESTDIR support from #24024.  It doesn't make sense to do for packages that haven't been converted to the new install/uninstall method yet.  However, for any remaining packages that need to be converted, they should also get an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` at the same time, where appropriate.

The pyflakes plugin found an actual bug in the elliptic_curves package; it wasn't otherwise caught since I didn't bump the package versions for this (it isn't really necessary to).

I think I should fix that, and test doing a forced-reinstall of all these packages.  I know I did that a long time ago back when this was part of #22510, but that was then...

 This work was brought over from an older branch and still needs some adjustment: It should incorporate the changes from the #24024 metaticket which conflict with some of these changes.  There are also some additional optional and experimental packages (and maybe a couple standard packages) that still need to be updated as well.
 
 Probably won't bother with that until and unless #25139 is approved of in some form that still includes the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` feature.

+
+To summarize what this is about: Part of the goal in implementing the new installation/uninstallation system for packages is that `spkg-install` should, ideally, not modify `$SAGE_LOCAL` in any way, at least for packages that support `DESTDIR`-based installation.  This allows more separation from the building of packages from their runtime installation target.
+
+However, many packages' `spkg-install` or `spkg-build` include commands (mostly in the form of `rm -rf`'s) to clean up files from previous installs of those packages.  This is no longer necessary for new-style package installations that track exactly what files are installed by a package.  But it is still necessary when upgrading from old installs of packages that don't have a file manifest.  This is what the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script is for.  It's just taking the `rm -rf`'s from `spkg-install` and moving it into a separate script that is called by the uninstaller if it doesn't have a file manifest for that package.
+
+So this ticket is just creating the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` for many packages that already have `DESTDIR` support.

First of all, there are merge conflicts.

Second, do we really need this? I understand that you want to clean up the `spkg-install` scripts, but we can do that gradually as we upgrade packages anyway. I don't really see the point of adding a whole new feature only for backwards compatibility in cases where it almost never matters (typically, it's not a problem to skip the uninstall).

I'm not actively against this ticket, it's just that I don't see the point.

Well I mean, there weren't 2 weeks ago and that's obviously resolvable so it's not a big deal.

I'm not in any hurry on this and am also happy to do it gradually.  Though since it's already done I don't see the point in *not* just going ahead and merging this now either.  It would be more work at this point not to.
