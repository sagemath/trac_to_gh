Attachment: **[cython-0.29.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket25292/cython-0.29.log)**

Running `make distclean && make cython` with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, I'm reproducibly getting one test failing (see log).

(The two failing tests in #26450 don't seem to be an issue anymore in 0.29.)

The curating is imperfect and for some distros it is listed under "cython" and for other under "python:cython" https://repology.org/metapackage/python:cython/versions not much you can do about that.
