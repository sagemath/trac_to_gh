Currently the Cython cache (disabled) would be written to ~/.cycache and ~/.cython/inline. Since Sage ships its own (possibly patched) version of Cython, we should not mix our cache with the cache of the Cython that might be installed by the distribution or the user.

I don't agree with this:

```
the version of Cython that
writes to CYTHON_CACHE_DIR might be incompatible with the (patched) version
shipped with Sage.
```
If Cython gives the same fingerprint for different Cython versions, that's clearly a bug in Cython.

I don't think it's a bug. Upstream makes sure that released versions of cython work properly. If you start to patch them, then you are on your own.

That's `CCACHE_BASEDIR` which is specifically meant to *share* caches. It's basically setting the environment prefix such that ccache can ignore it. So it's rather the opposite of what you propose here.

I'm not following you here... of course we will make sure that the Cython-in-Sage works correctly.

What I'm asking is the following: is it possible for two different Cython installations that produce different C code to accidentally re-use the same cache file?

- If yes: it's a Cython bug

- If no: no need for the Sage-specific cycache directory

I don't know exactly how ccache solves this problem, but it seems to work: you can mix GCC versions and ccache knows the difference.

Say if we backported a patch (without changing Cython's version number - and it is unrealistic to assume that people will remember to change that version number) then it is likely that our Cython and the official Cython behave somewhat differently. If that difference in behaviour is "after" the cache lookup, then you "break" Cython caching in some sense.

But that's an academic discussion. In practice this won't happen.

Is it possible for two released versions of Cython to use the cache incorrectly, ideally not anymore; and sure, if it were then it would be a bug in Cython.

Let's close this issue.
