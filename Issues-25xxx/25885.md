This ticket implements support for polynomial rings *with indexed variables* such as `macaulay2("QQ[x_0..x_2]").to_sage()` in the conversion routine of the Macaulay2 interface. Only integer indices will work, as sage has no mechanism to handle indices that are tuples or lists.

In the process, this also fixes all the failing doctests due to switching to the most recent version of Macaulay2 1.11. Note that this was mostly a matter of small differences in the output of Macaulay2, except for the `_tab_completion` which was actually not working.

This is awesome that someone takes care about macaulay2 interface, thanks !

Aside question: there used to be an old-style spkg some 10+ years ago, see http://old.files.sagemath.org/spkg/archive/, do you plan to package it again or is it beyond your knowledge of Sage packaging system (otherwise i could give a try) ?

OK, in fact this branch already fixes the tab completion, sorry for noise.
I am testing this with M2 version 1.12.0.1, the latest available in source, and I get errors in the 2 places where you changed

```
load -- read Macaulay2 commands
*******************************
```
to

```
load
****
```
(and, naturally, at the place where the version is checked, but that's OK)
I'm willing to give this a positive review, provided that `load ---...` stuff is fixed, which is easy to make generic and working for both versions:

Given that M2 is a mini-distribution, akin to Sage (well, much smaller, but still) it is a nontrivial task to have it built in Sage (many, but not all, libraries needed by M2 are in Sage, so these need to be dealt with too).

Fortunately M2 now (almost) got rid of the need to patch its libraries for bdwgc (aka Boehm GC, aka gc), this means won't need changes to Sage's libs to accommodate them.
