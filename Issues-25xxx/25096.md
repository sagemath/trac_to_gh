by dropping `usage()`.


I don't think it's necessary to expose this in the Sage interface. Its doctest fails for Debian at least (where tachyon's usage screen has been patched?) If people are in IPython or a Jupyter notebook, they can just type `!tachyon` to see the same information. In theory this breaks the existing interface but I am quite sure nobody is relying on this.
