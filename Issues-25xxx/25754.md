We cache the generic `basis()`, and not caching the filtered version causes significant slowdowns when calling, e.g., `monomial()` of Lie algebras:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,5)
sage: %time M = L.killing_form_matrix()
CPU times: user 7.4 s, sys: 33.2 ms, total: 7.43 s
Wall time: 7.37 s
```
versus with caching

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ,5)
sage: %time M = L.killing_form_matrix()
CPU times: user 1.39 s, sys: 38.3 ms, total: 1.42 s
Wall time: 1.38 s
```
