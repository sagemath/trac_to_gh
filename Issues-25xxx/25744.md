<a id='comment:3'></a>You can import `is_Polynomial` from `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element` and instead of using `isinstance(args[0], Polynomial)`, you may use `is_Polynomial(args[0])`.

Also, I think the polynomial needs to be defined over a finite field with characteristic `2`, this needs to be checked.

And the construction of `S` can be simplified further as `S = [ poly(v) for v in sorted(R) ]`
