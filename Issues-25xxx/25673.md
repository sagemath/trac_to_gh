But for `SEEALSO`-links I don't know what to do. Maybe #25675 for that?

I have one request, and a few stylistic documentation suggestions.

The request is: it is very impractical when the elements of the poset are just strings, please make them words, eg. `Word(v, alphabet=[1,2])`.  (other, extremely annoying examples are `SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset` and `SymmetricGroupWeakOrderPoset`)

was correct.  It is `Return Young's lattice`, but `Return the Young-Fibonacci lattice`.  An (unconventional) alternative would be `Return the Young lattice`..

Also, `Elements of the (infinite) lattice contains strings of '1' and '2'.` is strange - the elements do not contain strings, the elements **are** strings (or words).

Of very minor importance: is it just convenience, or is it better to start with strings and then relabel to words?

Replying to [@mantepse](#comment%3A12):

Ah, OK. (Nothing comparable to a/an vs. the in my native language.)

> Also, `Elements of the (infinite) lattice contains strings of '1' and '2'.` is strange - the elements do not contain strings, the elements **are** strings (or words).

Arghs! I did a copy-paste -error, I was going to use your suggestion in the docstring in the last commit. Now corrected.

> Of very minor importance: is it just convenience, or is it better to start with strings and then relabel to words?

I am quite sure that using Python built-in types first is faster.
