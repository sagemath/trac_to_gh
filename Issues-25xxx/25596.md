I was just thinking that they are not interesting outside testing. Can be "published" of course.

Nope, if we suppose that the functions in the category only needs an `less_or_equal`-function.

Well, people may also want test random things in some (perhaps large) poset, so I could see a benefit from having these be public methods of `FinitePoset`.
