Ordered set partitions are in bijection with packed words. It would be nice to be able to work with packed words in the Hopf algebra WQSym. In the branch, I shall also implement "tight" and "compact" notations for the output.

I'm happy with these changes. How do others feel about the following snippet from `OrderedSetPartition` ?:

```
    INPUT:

    - ``parts`` -- the parts of the ordered set partition
    - ``from_word`` -- (optional) allows the creation of an ordered set
      partition from any finite word or iterable , e.g., a packed word
```

The reader may be led to think that `parts` is required. In fact, the way the code is written, exactly one of `parts` and `from_word` is used (and it's `from_word` if that one is given). It must be a keyword/named argument, as the code is currently written, because I was being lazy about how to distinguish between the two possible inputs. E.g., if the lone argument [[1,2],[4],[3]] is passed, should this be viewed as a word on the alphabet "finite subsets of `NN`" or as a partition of {1,2,3,4} into blocks? Probably the latter, but should I make that restriction on future use?

The other way would be to say "one of the following must be provided" but that is slightly misleading as `parts` could be a packed word IIRC. Thinking a little more, perhaps this is better:

```
INPUT

- ``parts`` -- an object or iterable that defines an ordered set partition;
  if there is ambiguity, use the keyword ``from_word`` if the input should
  be treated as a packed word
```

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nYes, this is the behavior we want. It is stupid and annoying to make users have to use a keyword argument when a packed word as a list is sufficient. The ambiguity is when you want a packed word whose letters are sets/lists/etc. (This is also not ducktyping, but parsing input. Ducktyping is doing something like `L[0]`, where `L` could be a list/tuple/iterable and gets treated in the same way.)",

Yes, this is the behavior we want. It is stupid and annoying to make users have to use a keyword argument when a packed word as a list is sufficient. The ambiguity is when you want a packed word whose letters are sets/lists/etc. (This is also not ducktyping, but parsing input. Ducktyping is doing something like `L[0]`, where `L` could be a list/tuple/iterable and gets treated in the same way.)

So what is better for `__classcall_private__`? Trying to process an ordered set partition first, or trying to process a packed word first?

At present, the code first tries to process `part` as a packed word:

```
        # if `parts` looks like a sequence of "letters" then treat it like a word.
        if parts in Words() or (len(parts) > 0 and isinstance(parts[0], (str, int, Integer))):
            return OrderedSetPartitions().from_finite_word(Words()(parts))
        else:
            P = OrderedSetPartitions( reduce(lambda x,y: x.union(y), map(Set, parts), Set([])) )
            return P.element_class(P, parts)
```

but this might be better:

```
        # if `parts` looks like a sequence of "sets" then treat it like an ordered set partition.
        if parts in OrderedSetPartitions() or (len(parts) > 0 and isinstance(parts[0], (list, tuple, set, Set))):
            P = OrderedSetPartitions( reduce(lambda x,y: x.union(y), map(Set, parts), Set([])) )
            return P.element_class(P, parts)
        else:
            return OrderedSetPartitions().from_finite_word(Words()(parts))
```

If you want a quick way to turn a packed word into a basis element of `WQSym`, define a helper function, like

Maybe this should be suggested in the doc.

I think this is still "have", but I don't have a concrete issue.

I agree with Darij on this, it should only affect the printing output as a convenience for the user.

Actually, why the packed word input does not work (which at least `M[1,1,2,1]` I think should) is because this fails:

```
sage: OSP = OrderedSetPartitions()
sage: OSP([1,1,2,1])
...
TypeError: Element has no defined underlying set
```
So we might want to consider moving the checking to see if the input-is-a-word to the `_element_constructor_`.

This seems like a good idea to me. I can start a ticket to make this happen. However, ...

I wonder what will/should happen when the user enters `M[1,2,3]`. Right now, I believe one sees `M[{1,2,3}]`. Are we all in agreement that one should instead see `M[{1}, {2}, {3}]`? And that we should demand the user enter `M[This is the Trac macro *1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2,3-macro)` to get the former?

Yeah..., came to that realization after working on the aforementioned branch for awhile this afternoon.
I hate to have `M[This is the Trac macro *1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2,3-macro)` get interpreted as `M[{1}, {2}, {3}]` (and equally hate asking the user to enter `M[This is the Trac macro *[1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#[1,2,3-macro)]`).

If we avoid making a distinction between tuples and lists, should we then drop this idea altogether? So, in documentation, we suggest users build the `Mw` shortcut of Darij?

Quite possibly. Another option I just thought of is to construct a custom `basis` method that takes a parameter `indexed_by_words`, where the default is `False`. If `True`, then it returns a basis such that it goes through the `OrderedSetPartitions.from_word`.
