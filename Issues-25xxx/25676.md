Keywords: doctests

There are at least a handful of doctests that expect `OSError` to be raised.  However, Python 3 added many [OSError subclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#os-exceptions) that are raised in many common cases instead (e.g. `FileNotFoundError`).

This patches doctest results to paper over this difference in doctests written against Python 2.

Not due to anything related to these changes.  If someone will otherwise give a conditional positive review to this ticket I'll make sure the pyflakes warnings get taken care of as a rider to this before it's merged.

Why two line break ?

```

i mean why writing :

```
exc_msg = exc_msg.replace(subcls, 'OSError',

                          1)
```
rather than 

```
exc_msg = exc_msg.replace(subcls, 'OSError',
                          1)
```

I am not saying it's an important issue (it's not). I just wonder why.

in the for loop to get a shorter line?
