We have nothing agains building shared libraries, nor autoconf.
(just lack of time to do it and test it properly)

We had started our own configuration script a long time ago. It works pretty well, and we were suggested not to switch ;-)

We can offer support in case of need!

<a id='comment:15'></a>It seems cocoalib or libcocoa was packaged in the Sage's early days.

Can someone check whether all previous Cocoa-related tickets are obsolete?

https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~cocoa

At this point the list has four tickets from before the present one:
- #8527, #8521 are still open tickets
- #6298, #5861 are closed
