CC:  @tscrim

This is a follow up to #24691.

Morphisms for matrix groups are a separate class which offers little functionality. They can be replaced by `libgap_morphism` which unifies matters and allows homomorphisms to other libgap groups.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25444

Not sure what you mean here?

Good suggestion. I tend to be too quick about such things. I could remove the test entirely, but then the patchbot will complain about coverage going down?

You have removed the `_call_` method, so the docstring/test no longer applies.

Maybe there is a bug in lazy_import. It does not show the deprecation for me.
Can you reproduce it?

```
sage: G = GO(2,2,e=1)
sage: P = G.Hom(G)
sage: from sage.groups.matrix_gps.morphism import MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
sage: MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens(P,G.gens())
Group endomorphism of General Orthogonal Group of degree 2 and form parameter 1 over Finite Field of size 2

sage: MatrixGroupMorphism_im_gens
.... DeprecationWarning: ....
