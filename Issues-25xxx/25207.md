Some platforms--mostly notably the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) aka "bash for Windows", and sometimes Cygwin depending on how it's configured--do not correctly handle full emulation of POSIX permissions on files.

Also, some filesystems like FAT32 (called `vfat` on Linux) do not support those permissions, even if the OS does support it.

Such systems often employ a workaround of implicitly setting the "executable" bit on all files, regardless of whether they're actually executable.  This is necessary so that files that should be executable work properly, and should just be ignored on other files (though it is an annoyance, and somewhat jarring when using `ls`).

On these systems, running `chmod -x <filename>` does nothing: the executable bit remains set.  We could detect this at configure-time, and at least try to be more flexible about how we handle executable files on such platforms.

See https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/936 for the upstream issue in WSL.
