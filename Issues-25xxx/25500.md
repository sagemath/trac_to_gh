This ticket provides to Sage the possibility to check if a space-time is a solution of Einstein's equations and even with some assumptions given as a list. Sage would be able to compute the Einstein's tensor and the user can set the gravitational constante and more. The user can also check if a 2-times covariant tensor is an energy momentum tensor. It is possible to ask conditions to obtain a space-time or an energy momentum, the output might be a system of equations.
