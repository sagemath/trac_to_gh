Currently, it is returning a (sorted) list.  However, this is not good when trying to iterate through the linear extensions of slightly larger posets.

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()`

takes about zero time, whereas

takes at least a minute, and for example

You are simply interrupting the computation in `posets.AntichainPoset(10).linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.list()`.

You can see this as follows: in a fresh session (!!!) do the same as before, that is, interrupt

```
sage: P = posets.AntichainPoset(10)
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
then again

```
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
which will yield

```
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
Then check that

```
sage: P.linear_extensions().cardinality()
3628800
```
Finally:

```
sage: len(P.linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.linear_extensions)
```
which will tell you a smaller number.  And indeed

```
sage: P.linear_extensions()[3628800-1]
```

- It is better practice to copy the dag on input rather than at `_prepare` as it is possible to pass the dag in, modify the dag, and then run `_prepare`. It also means that it will never have an inconsistent state by having linear extensions for a dag that is not its `self.dag`.

- Errors are not full sentences by Python conventions:

- The result is no longer cached. So if this is called repeatedly for the same dag, this could be slower. I think your change is okay, but it might have unintended consequences in terms of speed. Did you check this?

```
(because this now gives `False`)

Also, maybe it would be better to deprecate the class `LinearExtensions` completely, the class `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` should be a good replacement (and might be renamed `LinearExtensions`).

Because `Parent` does not have an `__eq__` method (so it defaults to compare by id, which is obviously false).

`LinearExtensions` was serving as an iterator object that yielded low level objects. Now this is done by your cython iterator. So +1 for deprecating it, -1 from saying `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` is a replacement.

Also, I have a general -1 on all of those `sorted`. They should not be necessary, and within code, they can be (relatively) expensive when not needed.
