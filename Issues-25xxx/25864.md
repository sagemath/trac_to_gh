I do not understand. "Currently, it is returning a (sorted) list.", but already

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()`

takes about zero time, whereas

`_ = list(posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions())`

takes at least a minute, and for example

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()[2000]`

takes a fraction of a second. So, this seems to already be an iterator.

Currently, `P.linear_extensions()` returns a class, with some (rather little) initialisations done.  This class has a `__list__` method, which triggers the actual computation.

You are simply interrupting the computation in `posets.AntichainPoset(10).linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.list()`.

You can see this as follows: in a fresh session (!!!) do the same as before, that is, interrupt

```
sage: P = posets.AntichainPoset(10)
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
then again

```
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
which will yield

```
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
Then check that

```
sage: P.linear_extensions().cardinality()
3628800
```
Finally:

```
sage: len(P.linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.linear_extensions)
```
which will tell you a smaller number.  And indeed

```
sage: P.linear_extensions()[3628800-1]
```
will give an error (after a while, because lists are copied all the time).

In the process of reading the code in `graphs/linearextensions.py`, and trying to figure out how it needs to be modified to become an iterator.

Some things:

- It is better practice to copy the dag on input rather than at `_prepare` as it is possible to pass the dag in, modify the dag, and then run `_prepare`. It also means that it will never have an inconsistent state by having linear extensions for a dag that is not its `self.dag`.

- Errors are not full sentences by Python conventions:

  ```diff
  -ValueError("The digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions.")
  +ValueError("the digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions")
  ```

- The result is no longer cached. So if this is called repeatedly for the same dag, this could be slower. I think your change is okay, but it might have unintended consequences in terms of speed. Did you check this?

It appears to me now that this class actually shouldn't be a parent, because that's what `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` does, except that the latter is specialised to posets, not arbitrary DAGs.

Apart from there, this class is only used once in library code, in `Permutation`.

Alternatively, blow it up similarly to `LinearExtensionsOfPoset`, but I'm a bit afraid that this is really only bloat.

Because `Parent` does not have an `__eq__` method (so it defaults to compare by id, which is obviously false).

`LinearExtensions` was serving as an iterator object that yielded low level objects. Now this is done by your cython iterator. So +1 for deprecating it, -1 from saying `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` is a replacement.

Also, I have a general -1 on all of those `sorted`. They should not be necessary, and within code, they can be (relatively) expensive when not needed.

I am now removing the sorted from the doctests, but I must say that I think this is wrong, for the following reasons:

* it saves no time (because sorting a list of 4 elements is not very costly)

* it makes the doctests less expressive: adding the `sorted` also tells the user not to rely on the order

* it creates a lot of work and larger diffs.

I am totally with you to remove the sorted from the methods, however.

No problem, I very much value your work, and I overreacted, because I did not and do not see any sense in removing the sorting, as I explained above.  (In fact, putting in the sorting also took some time.)

I hope that this can be merged soon, so #25865 can be merged, too.

Thank you for removing the unnecessary sorting.

The patchbot is getting one failure:

```
File "src/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.py", line 1400, in sage.combinat.posets.poset_examples.Posets.YoungDiagramPoset
Failed example:
    P.cover_relations()
Expected:
    [[(0, 0), (1, 0)], [(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)],
     [(0, 1), (1, 1)]]
Got:
    [[(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(0, 0), (1, 0)], [(0, 1), (1, 1)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)]]
```
Also, before you whine about this, this was *not* affected by the sorting changes.
