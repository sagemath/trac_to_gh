I do not understand. "Currently, it is returning a (sorted) list.", but already

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()`

takes about zero time, whereas

`_ = list(posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions())`

takes at least a minute, and for example

`_ = posets.BooleanLattice(4).linear_extensions()[2000]`

takes a fraction of a second. So, this seems to already be an iterator.

Currently, `P.linear_extensions()` returns a class, with some (rather little) initialisations done.  This class has a `__list__` method, which triggers the actual computation.

You are simply interrupting the computation in `posets.AntichainPoset(10).linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.list()`.

You can see this as follows: in a fresh session (!!!) do the same as before, that is, interrupt

```
sage: P = posets.AntichainPoset(10)
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
then again

```
sage: for x in P.linear_extensions():
....:     print x
....:     break
```
which will yield

```
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```
Then check that

```
sage: P.linear_extensions().cardinality()
3628800
```
Finally:

```
sage: len(P.linear_extensions()._linear_extensions_of_hasse_diagram.linear_extensions)
```
which will tell you a smaller number.  And indeed

```
sage: P.linear_extensions()[3628800-1]
```
will give an error (after a while, because lists are copied all the time).

In the process of reading the code in `graphs/linearextensions.py`, and trying to figure out how it needs to be modified to become an iterator. I may need to read a bit more of the paper to understand what the individual helper methods are doing and how they tie together. I'm hoping it will eventually be as easy as changing the end of the `move()` and `switch()` methods to be yield statements, and make the `list()` method an `_iter_()` method.

One potential problem that could arise by changing things is if any other code relies on linear extensions of a poset being generated in lexicographic order.

Some things:

- It is better practice to copy the dag on input rather than at `_prepare` as it is possible to pass the dag in, modify the dag, and then run `_prepare`. It also means that it will never have an inconsistent state by having linear extensions for a dag that is not its `self.dag`.

- Errors are not full sentences by Python conventions:

  ```diff
  -ValueError("The digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions.")
  +ValueError("the digraph must be acyclic to have linear extensions")
  ```

- The result is no longer cached. So if this is called repeatedly for the same dag, this could be slower. I think your change is okay, but it might have unintended consequences in terms of speed. Did you check this?

It appears to me now that this class actually shouldn't be a parent, because that's what `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` does, except that the latter is specialised to posets, not arbitrary DAGs.

Apart from there, this class is only used once in library code, in `Permutation`.

Alternatively, blow it up similarly to `LinearExtensionsOfPoset`, but I'm a bit afraid that this is really only bloat.

Because `Parent` does not have an `__eq__` method (so it defaults to compare by id, which is obviously false).

`LinearExtensions` was serving as an iterator object that yielded low level objects. Now this is done by your cython iterator. So +1 for deprecating it, -1 from saying `LinearExtensionsOfPoset` is a replacement.

Also, I have a general -1 on all of those `sorted`. They should not be necessary, and within code, they can be (relatively) expensive when not needed.

Oh, I didn't realize that `Poset` has a method returning `LinearExtensionsOfPoset`...

I am now removing the sorted from the doctests, but I must say that I think this is wrong, for the following reasons:

* it saves no time (because sorting a list of 4 elements is not very costly)

* it makes the doctests less expressive: adding the `sorted` also tells the user not to rely on the order

* it creates a lot of work and larger diffs.

I am totally with you to remove the sorted from the methods, however.

No problem, I very much value your work, and I overreacted, because I did not and do not see any sense in removing the sorting, as I explained above.  (In fact, putting in the sorting also took some time.)

I hope that this can be merged soon, so #25865 can be merged, too.

Thank you for removing the unnecessary sorting.

The patchbot is getting one failure:

```
File "src/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.py", line 1400, in sage.combinat.posets.poset_examples.Posets.YoungDiagramPoset
Failed example:
    P.cover_relations()
Expected:
    [[(0, 0), (1, 0)], [(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)],
     [(0, 1), (1, 1)]]
Got:
    [[(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(0, 0), (1, 0)], [(0, 1), (1, 1)], [(1, 0), (1, 1)]]
```
Also, before you whine about this, this was *not* affected by the sorting changes.
