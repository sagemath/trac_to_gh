This moves all module-level persistence/pickling related functions that were defined in `sage.structure.sage_object` into `sage.misc.persistence` (where they were already included via imports).

See the commit message for more details.  See also follow-up ticket #25154

I felt that doing something like this made sense before I continued work #24582, which proposes to add more abstraction around the pickle module.

I would keep this in `sage_object.pyx`:

```python
def make_None(*args, **kwds):
    """
    Do nothing and return ``None``. Used for overriding pickles when
    that pickle is no longer needed.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.structure.sage_object import make_None
        sage: print(make_None(42, pi, foo='bar'))
        None
    """
    return None


# Generators is no longer used (#21382)
register_unpickle_override('sage.structure.generators', 'make_list_gens', make_None)
```
This really refers to deprecated features of `SageObject`.

Mostly moving code around, yes--I can certainly help direct you to where the only significant differences are.  The module-level `save()` function is rewritten such that the core of its implementation is move into `_base_save()`, and likewise the module-level `dumps` function is rewritten to use use `_base_dumps()`.  Likewise, `SageObject.save()` and `SageObject.dumps()` are rewritten similarly.

Nothing below `unpickle_override()` in `sage.misc.persist` is new or modified in any way except to change some imports.

Ok. While we're at it could I just delete `make_None` entirely?  It's not used anywhere else and it can be written trivially as an in-line lambda...
