As pointed in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41985/connected-sum-of-knots/ the connected sum of knots is not correctly computed.

Before this ticket, the connected sum of the trefoil knot with itself is incorrect,
and computing the connected sum with a third trefoil knot fails:

```
sage: c = Knot.connected_sum
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: t = Knot(B([1, 1, 1])); t
Knot represented by 3 crossings
sage: tt = c(t, t); tt
Knot represented by 7 crossings
sage: tt_t = c(tt, t); tt_t
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: the input has more than 1 connected component
sage: t_tt = c(t, tt); t_tt
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: generators not in the group
```
After this ticket, these problems are fixed:

```
sage: c = Knot.connected_sum
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: t = Knot(B([1, 1, 1])); t
Knot represented by 3 crossings
sage: tt = c(t, t); tt
Knot represented by 6 crossings
sage: t_tt = c(t, tt); t_tt
Knot represented by 9 crossings
sage: tt_t = c(tt, t); tt_t
Knot represented by 9 crossings
sage: t_tt = tt_t
True
```
