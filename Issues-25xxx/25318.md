As discussed in
[this 2018-06 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Sqt4N8eVq-o/discussion),
this is part of an effort to improve fraction field elements,
and in particular rational fractions in several variables,
spread across four tickets:

- #25318: Improve basic operations with fraction field elements (the present ticket)
- #25290: Don't use Karatsuba for multiplying polynomials over fraction fields
- #23909; GCD for univariate polynomials over fraction fields
- #16268: Better normalization for fraction field elements

At least for some applications, these tickets bring Sage fraction field elements
from "so slow they are unusable" to "not really great yet but reasonable".

I also don't want to block progress on fraction fields which would be quite nice. But can't we have both?

No matter how you implement it, lots of implementations that are not aware of inexact elements break.\n\n\nOk, perhaps calling it a bug is a bit strong. But in the parts of Sage I'm familiar with, there are a number of generic algorithms that already use equality and (more importantly) `is_zero()`, `is_one()`, `bool()` in a way compatible with interval-like rings... but with the semantics of interval arithmetic, not those of p-adics.\n\n> If you take the above doctest out, doesn't this mean that you produce a wrong result again now?\n\n\nYes, I think so.\n\n> I am not sure that it's valid to just claim that p-adics are broken, so we should not care about them.\n> \n> I also don't want to block progress on fraction fields which would be quite nice. But can't we have both?\n\n\nIn the present case, I don't really see how without changing the implementation of p-adics, but if you have an idea I'd love to hear it!\n\nDo you think it would be break anything if we modified the p-adic `is_zero()` and `is_one()` without touching\u00a0`==`, though?

Ok, perhaps calling it a bug is a bit strong. But in the parts of Sage I'm familiar with, there are a number of generic algorithms that already use equality and (more importantly) `is_zero()`, `is_one()`, `bool()` in a way compatible with interval-like rings... but with the semantics of interval arithmetic, not those of p-adics.

Yes, I think so.

In the present case, I don't really see how without changing the implementation of p-adics, but if you have an idea I'd love to hear it!

Do you think it would be break anything if we modified the p-adic `is_zero()` and `is_one()` without touchingÂ `==`, though? While it can be argued that `==` is an âinternalâ operation on each parent (using it in combination with coercion is known to be dangerous anyway), whose semantics could vary from parent to parent, I really don't see anyone calling `is_one()` and expecting it to return `True` on anything but the exact unit element, even for p-adics... And I guess that change already would be enough to make most generic algorithms work on p-adics.

Strictly speaking it isn't, but that's because we're unable to reduce over that ring, hence there is no point in trying again later. (Cf. the comment in front of the initial definition of `_is_reduced` in `__init__()`.)

I think you are right, `is_reduced=self._is_reduced` would be better in these cases.

AFAICT it is the other way around: the try-excepts that are present in some cases are leftovers from a previous version and are unnecessary.

See above for the other points.
