As discussed in
[this 2018-06 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Sqt4N8eVq-o/discussion),
this is part of an effort to improve fraction field elements,
and in particular rational fractions in several variables,
spread across four tickets:

- #25318: Improve basic operations with fraction field elements (the present ticket)
- #25290: Don't use Karatsuba for multiplying polynomials over fraction fields
- #23909; GCD for univariate polynomials over fraction fields
- #16268: Better normalization for fraction field elements

At least for some applications, these tickets bring Sage fraction field elements
from "so slow they are unusable" to "not really great yet but reasonable".

Yes, I think so.

In the present case, I don't really see how without changing the implementation of p-adics, but if you have an idea I'd love to hear it!

Do you think it would be break anything if we modified the p-adic `is_zero()` and `is_one()` without touchingÂ `==`, though? While it can be argued that `==` is an âinternalâ operation on each parent (using it in combination with coercion is known to be dangerous anyway), whose semantics could vary from parent to parent, I really don't see anyone calling `is_one()` and expecting it to return `True` on anything but the exact unit element, even for p-adics... And I guess that change already would be enough to make most generic algorithms work on p-adics.

+spread across four tickets:
+
+- #25318: Improve basic operations with fraction field elements (the present ticket)
+- #25290: Don't use Karatsuba for multiplying polynomials over fraction fields
+- #23909; GCD for univariate polynomials over fraction fields
+- #16268: Better normalization for fraction field elements

I assume you mean in `_add_`? But even so I don't understand the question: this line is under `if d.is_unit()`, and I'm dividing by `d` (or trying to) when that's not the case.

See the discussion above: I think it is correct over most inexact rings (RR, RDF, RBF, RIF, CC, CDF, CBF, CIF, SR... and constructions over them), but apparently not over p-adic rings, unfortunately. For want of a proper solution, I'm now using this logic over exact rings only.

I dropped the test because I didn't realize this behavior of `is_zero()` and `is_one()` was something the p-adics people actually wanted. I have restored it in the rebased branch.

Strictly speaking it isn't, but that's because we're unable to reduce over that ring, hence there is no point in trying again later. (Cf. the comment in front of the initial definition of `_is_reduced` in `__init__()`.)

I think you are right, `is_reduced=self._is_reduced` would be better in these cases.

AFAICT it is the other way around: the try-excepts that are present in some cases are leftovers from a previous version and are unnecessary.

See above for the other points.
