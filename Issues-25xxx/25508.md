Implement a function that given a set of values of invariants of a binary quintic, finds a quintic that attains these values up to scaling. 

A general framework for reconstruction is implemented for quintics defined over fields of characteric different from 2, 3 and 5. This is placed in the new invariants folder created in ticket #26370.

For fields of characteristic 2, 3 and 5, see ticket #26786.

This ticket requires binary quintics for computations and doctests, so depends on #25395.
