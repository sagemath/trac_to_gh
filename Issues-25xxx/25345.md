Because the html docs are non-essential and take up a lot of space, distributions usually make them an optional dependency of sage.

I am doing the same for nix and I would like to be able to test sage and the docs independent from each other.

This patch makes the doctests that depend on the htmldocs optional, but enables those doctests by default. So to exclude them, one has to explicitly specify `--optional=sage`.

For that to work I also make sure that the optional `py2` tag is only added if `sage` is in the optionals list. I don't know if it was intended that way, but it was definitely surprising to me that all tests marked as `py2` were *always* run, even with `--optional=asdf-does-not-exists`.

(The same goes for `--long`: I expected it to act as an `AND` as in "in optionals list AND long", but instead it just includes all tests marked as long. I left that unchanged.)

1. You're adding bogus files like `octave-workspace`.

2. I'm not too happy with the name `htmldoc`. It doesn't correspond to anything.

3. As I mentioned on some other ticket, the `# optional` should only be on the first line of a test example.

Documentation is an essential part of any software, so we should encourage everyone to build it or distribute it. Sage's philosophy has always been that documentation is a key part of the package, and an installation without it is incomplete. I think if someone chooses to not build the docs, then they should have the natural consequence of having some doctests fail.

> and take up a lot of space, distributions usually make them an optional dependency of sage. 


650MB is not that much space these days, is it?

Without html documentation sage still offers the `?` function (as in `abs?`) that should suffice for a lot of use cases.

Maybe not for you, but for somebody with a slow internet connection that wants to "quickly check out this software" its a lot of space/time.

I think you should analyze this more carefully before making this change. "Should suffice": when will it or won't it? For "a lot of use cases": which ones won't it suffice for? Reading the tutorial is one which is especially relevant to beginners; are there others? When you first start Sage, it says to run `help()` for help, and if you run this, it advertises two command which won't work without the docs: `tutorial()` and `manual()`.

Deciding not to include documentation is, in my experience, almost always a bad choice.

It's not about me, it's compared to the size of the rest of the Sage installation.

This change does not disable documentation in any way. It is still enabled by default and tested by default. It simply makes it *possible* to disable.

> "Should suffice": when will it or won't it? For "a lot of use cases": which ones won't it suffice for? Reading the tutorial is one which is especially relevant to beginners; are there others? When you first start Sage, it says to run `help()` for help, and if you run this, it advertises two command which won't work without the docs: `tutorial()` and `manual()`.


Without any facts to back it up, I'd guess that most beginners start with the online documentation.

> Deciding not to include documentation is, in my experience, almost always a bad choice.


Its the users choice.

Well `sagelib` (basically everything sage excluding dependencies and docs) only takes up 257M.
Of course realistically sage as a lot of dependencies that a user will not have pre-installed, but the documentation basically triples the minimum the user has to download.

I don't think that this ticket changes that.

I see little harm in marking those tests `optional` provided that `make (p)test(long)` still test them by default.
