Currently, introspection does not work in [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/issues/39) and Arch Linux (if the sagemath-doc package is not installed):

```
sage: ZZ?
…
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sagedoc.pyc in process_extlinks(s, embedded)
    497     oldpath = sys.path
    498     sys.path = [os.path.join(SAGE_DOC_SRC, 'common')] + oldpath
--> 499     from conf import extlinks
    500     sys.path = oldpath
    501     for key in extlinks:

ImportError: cannot import name extlinks
```

The problem is that `src/doc/common/conf.py` is not in the place that Sage expects.

I don't think that we should require the documentation configuration to be installed for Sage to work.

A docker image to play with this is being built here: https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/pipelines/25262253

Depends on #25843
