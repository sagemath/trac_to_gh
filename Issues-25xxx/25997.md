Oddly enough, it turns out that `get_matrix_class` doesn't even get as far as testing whether the base ring is a finite field.

Gosh, the bug is in the test for an integer mod ring:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(3))
True
```

So, apparently its implementation has changed. I am not gonna argue about `is_IntegerModRing`, because mathematically `GF(3)` IS an integer mod ring. but then to the very least `get_matrix_class` should first test for finite fields and only later for integer mod rings.

A finite prime field is at the same time an integer mod ring. So, if the implementation "meataxe" is requested for a matrix over a finite prime field, this case should be dealt with in the "if" clause testing for an integer mod ring. With that fix, at least the tests in src/sage/matrix pass. So, I'll push the branch in a minute...

I guess the logic should be:
1. Is a specific implementation requested? If this is the case, test whether this specific implementation supports the given base ring.
2. Otherwise, choose a default implementation according to whether R is finite, a field, a quotient ring, etc.

Currently, these two tasks are intertwined. First, some properties of the ring are checked and only then it is considered whether an implementation is requested.

I think the new commit provides a cleaner way of choosing the implementation for a matrix. The tests in src/sage/matrix pass (with optional meataxe), but I didn't run the full test suite yet.

Still needs review, of course.

Just two quick minor comments:

I believe there is a very mild behavior change when passing `implementation=''` (or `0` or `[]`, etc.) as now that will be treated the same as `implementation=None`.

I don't think you need the nested `if` inside of the `CDF` case (as you already have `not implementation` being `True`).

I just notice that I forgot to react.

Do you recall what "mild behaviour change" you see?

Before this would result in an error, but with you change, it now should get treated as if you passed `None`. It is not a bad thing IMO, but just something I noticed and am pointing out.
