Classes are pickled by name in Sage, and reconstructed as in this example upon unpickling:

```
sage: cls = unpickle_global('sage.categories.hopf_algebras_with_basis', 'HopfAlgebrasWithBasis.TensorProducts')
```
In practice, `unpickle_global` loads the module, and search for the full class name `HopfAlgebrasWithBasis.TensorProducts` in the dictionary of the module.

In the case of a nested class above which comes from a functorial construction, there currently are cases where, upon importing the module, the base class of the nested class has not yet been initialized, which leads to errors:

```
sage: cls(QQ)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
KeyError: 'HopfAlgebrasWithBasis.'
```

The initialization is indeed done upon accessing the class for the first time from its surrounding class:

```
    sage: HopfAlgebrasWithBasis.TensorProducts
```

Now everything works:

```
sage: cls is HopfAlgebrasWithBasis.TensorProducts
True
sage: cls(QQ)
Category of tensor products of hopf algebras with basis over Rational Field
```

Not sure what's the best way to proceed; forcing the unpickling
to unpickle instead the base class `HopfAlgebrasWithBasis`, and then recover `TensorProducts` by a `getattr` ?

I'll add the original non-working example that was found by Pauline.

Status: new
