Right now the only way to compute the rank of a sparse integer matrix is to either convert it to a dense matrix or a rational matrix (which simply does Gaussian elimination). Both of these options are horrible. Linbox provides a rank algorithm more for sparse matrices. The aim of this ticket is to expose this.

For example, I have a sparse matrix

```
matrix dims: 11550 x 5775
density: 1/1155
number nonzero positions: 57750
```
it takes <11s with linbox on my computer, and I gave up after well over minute doing it over **Q**.

This is a part of #13915.

Nice.

Please add tests for all possible corner cases (0 x 1, 1 x 0 and 0 x 0). I had troubles with these with other linbox functions.

I think that it would be better to isolate the conversion `dict -> sparse matrix` as in #24544 (`libs/linbox/conversion.pxd`). What do you think? Moreover, the datastructure for sparse integer matrix is not a dict. Converting to a dict is a lot of waste. Though, this can be done in a second time.
