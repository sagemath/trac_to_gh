After compiling and looking through the graph generators doc page, I noticed that the folded cube graph, the johnson graph, the turan graph, and line graph forbidden subgraph all have some non-standard formatting for their wikipedia links, and might as well be touched up.

It should be 'Return the Tutte 12-cage', not 'Return the Tutte's 12-cage'.

Wikipedia pages for sousselier graph and wiener-araya graph should to be reverted to have the non-standard formatting, since :wikipedia: defaults to the english version of the site (at least for me), and those articles only exist in the french version.
