From [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42532/more-problems-with-general-power-of-a-matrix/), the symbolic power of a matrix gives a result that is correct when restricted to positive integers, but wrong on 0:

```
sage: A = matrix(QQbar,3,3,[[-2,-8,-12],[1,4,4],[0,0,1]])
sage: k = SR.var('k')
sage: B = A^k
sage: B
[      -2^k     -4*2^k -4*2^k - 4]
[   1/2*2^k      2*2^k      2*2^k]
[         0          0          1]
sage: [B.subs(k=i) == A^i for i in range(20)]
[False,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,

 True]
sage: B.subs(k=0)
[ -1  -4  -8]
[1/2   2   2]
[  0   0   1]
```

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This is not really something we can do anything about, I expect. It's just a consequence of

```
sage: (0^x).simplify()
0
```
which is wrong for `x=0`.
