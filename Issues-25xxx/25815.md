Started getting this test failure on Cygwin:

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx

```

probably as a result of #25247, probably only on Cygwin due to a slight rounding difference in some libc math function.

Setting as blocker since it's the only way, apparently, to communicate priorities following a "release candidate 0" release even though I mentioned on sage-devel that it would be very helpful to have it merged.
