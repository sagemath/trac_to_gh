```
- GMP has a `mpz_2fac_ui` and `mpz_mfac_uiui` that we use in the `multifactorial` method of integers.
- we remove the conversion to symbolic ring of `factorial` method of integers and raise an `OverflowError` instead

```
sage: (2**64).factorial()
factorial(18446744073709551616)
```
  becomes

```
sage: (2**64).factorial()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: argument too large for factorial
```
- we fix the silent conversion of floating point to integers

```
sage: factorial(2.0)
2
```
  becomes

```
sage: factorial(2.0)
2.00000000000000
```
  and as a by product, factorial can be computed on real balls

```
sage: factorial(RBF(2)**64)
[+/- 2.30e+347382171305201370464]
```

Hi Vincent,

LGTM. Some minor remarks though:

```
+        -  ``n`` - a non-negative integer, a complex numberargument (except negative
```

Missing space.

```
         one it is the product of every k-th terms down from self to
-        k. The recursive definition is used to extend this function to
+        1. The recursive definition is used to extend this function to
```

Maybe move the 1 to the previous line.

```
+                try:
+                    res = method()
+                except Exception:
+                    pass
```

Are you sure you want to catch all exceptions? I think `ValueError` and `ArithmeticError` should be enough.

Here I just wanted to catch the `OverflowError` from factorial...
