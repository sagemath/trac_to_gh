Could you please set to positive, if you agree ?

By the way, I would like to find the polytope associated to an ample divisor class (polytope of sections of the associated line bundle). Do you have any idea on how to do that in sage ?

```
sage: F = eventail_own(4)
sage: V = ToricVariety(F)
sage: d = sum(V.Kaehler_cone().rays())
sage: d
Divisor class [-3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4]
```

EDIT:

ok, I have found what I was looking for:

```
d.lift().polyhedron()
```

I don't agree - there should be INPUT and OUTPUT and the documentation should clearly state that `F.toric_variety(...)` is equivalent to `ToricVariety(F, ...)` and so it is just a shortcut for convenience.

I am still not convinced that it is necessary - those who know about fans presumably do know about toric varieties as well and can figure out how to construct them, but there is no harm and since you find it useful, others may as well.
