Implementation of a SymplecticTableau object and SymplecticTableaux factory class.

The SymplecticTableau object will allow for the different types of symplectic tableau in the literature (Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux, DeConcini tableaux, King tableaux, Sundaram tableaux) and have methods to convert between any two of them. In particular, this will include an implementation of the Sheats bijection.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26143

Here is a long list of current TODOs:

1) Add test cases and examples for almost every method in SymplecticTableau and SymplecticTableaux factory classes. \\
2) In particular, add tests for Sheats bijection. \\
3) Add iterator for tableau of type DeConciniProcesi (currently it just iterators over KashiwaraNakashima tableaux using crystals, and then converts.) \\
4) Change everything from ``DeConciniProcesi`` to ``DeConcini`` (I'm not sure how we started using this terminology, but I think in the literature these tableau are only called DeConcini tableau.) \\
5) Write method for reverse berele bump. \\
6) Write method for a symplectic bender-knuth involution. \\
7) Write method for inverse of Sheats algorithm.
