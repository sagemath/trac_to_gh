A little bit of PEP-8 cleanup in this module and other code modernizations.  This does fix one bug, which was made apparent in the Python 3 doctests, where the local variable `module_name` in `import_statements` wasn't treated properly since it was also used as a loop variable, leading to strange bugs.
