The following previous bug was fixed by #24742:

```
sage: M = matrix(GF(9,'x'), 2,3)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: M*1
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
sage: M*int(1)
...
ValueError: Cannot initialise non-square matrix from 1
```

This ticket adds a test that makes sure that the issue remains fixed.

Depends on #24742

`sage -t --optional=meataxe,sage` will do.

> Simon: can you specify which version of Sage you using and whether any patches are applied?


Sorry. It's the branch from #18514, which means Sage 8.5.beta2. Another change: I recently installed tkinter. And something seems to be broken anyway: "git status" gives me untracked files `bin/`, `share/` etc. Likely reason: When I manually installed something, I gave the wrong prefix (SAGE_ROOT instead of SAGE_LOCAL) during configuration.

After removing the misplaced directories, re-installing the packages and sage -br, I get

Doesn't make sense, as a float doesn't coerce into GF(3).

By inserting print statements into the bin_op method of the coercion model, I found that it isn't even called, although it should be.

I just noticed something that supports your guess. When doing "sage -br", I noticed these lines:

Actually it is a lot worse than I thought:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 64,51)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense'>
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense cimport Matrix_gfpn_dense as MTX
....: def test1(MTX M):
....:     cdef size_t i
....:     cdef MTX N
....:     for i in range(100000):
....:         N = M*i
....: def test2(MTX M):
....:     cdef size_t i
....:     cdef MTX N
....:     for i in range(100000):
....:         N = M._mul_long(i)
....: """)
sage: %timeit test1(M)
1 loop, best of 3: 11.7 s per loop
sage: %timeit test2(M)
1 loop, best of 3: 366 ms per loop
sage: 11.7/0.366
31.9672131147541
```
So, the current code is almost 32 times slower than what used to happen, in a scenario that I do care about.

Hence, adding a doctest isn't enough.

Your behaviour makes me speechless. Almost.

The ticket description is about using the short-cut _mul_long as a solution to the problem that Matrix*int didn't work. As it turns out #24742 allows Matrix*int, but it doesn't do it by enabling _mul_long (although _mul_long is supported in sage.structure.element).

So, given the poor performance I demonstrated, there is an issue here that goes beyond what was fixed in #24742, and it is related with what the ticket description of this ticket says.

In addition, I notice that the current implementation of _mul_long for Matrix_gfpn_dense doesn't convert an integer into `GF(p^n,'x')` by reduction modulo p, but by some conversion used by MeatAxe. For instance, 4 would be converted to the number x+1 in GF(9,'x'). I didn't notice it before since in my cohomology applications I work with matrices over prime fields, where the different conversions happen to coincide.

Hence, if this ticket is about to "Fix Matrix_gfpn_dense*int", then here one should
1. re-enable the usage of _mul_long for matrix times int, because of the performance issue
2. fix _mul_long of Matrix_gfpn_dense for non-prime fields.

I changed the ticket description accordingly.

Consequently, this ticket is by no means just a duplicate of #24742.

And even when you insist that it is a duplicate: What would be the point of closing this ticket as a duplicate (or maybe just adding a test) and then opening yet another ticket that deals with the two remaining issues?

Alternatively, I could just leave the issues alone and use ._mul_long directly in my cohomology code, to be independent of whatever implementation of coercion is currently used.

1. It fixes the issue that `Matrix * int` didn't work.

2. It adds a doctest to show that 1. will remain fixed.

Issue 1 is fixed in the dependency and moreover these are not the only issues related with the original ticket description. And what would be the point of opening yet another ticket when the remaining issue can be dealt with here?

It is, by the way, not without precedence that a ticket description was changed because of issues that came up while working on the original ticket description.

Because this ticket already does something useful.

To turn your question around: what would be the point of **not** opening yet another ticket given that there are really two issues here (one about coercing scalars to the base ring and one about using `_mul_long`)?

-What #24742 doesn't fix:
-1. Multiplication of a matrix with a scalar that is given as a Python int fails to use _mul_long(), which is supported by sage.structure.element but isn't used anywhere in sage.matrix except in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.
-2. The _mul_long implementation of Matrix_gfpn_dense is flawed, as it *should* do a coercion of the given integer into the underlying base ring (which is by computing the remainder modulo the modulus of the base ring), but currently uses a different way of conversion.
-
+This ticket adds a test that makes sure that the issue remains fixed.

Those still look like different issues to me. One is about the coercion model and one is about the meataxe interface.

Yes, they are two different issues, but it is totally natural to deal with them on a single ticket: When one only fixes the coercion model, one would actually *introduce* a bug (namely: The flawed _mul_long of Matrix_gfpn_dense would be used). When one only fixes the meataxe interface, one wouldn't be able to demonstrate that it is fixed without using cython in doctests.

Yes, using cython in doctests is possible, but why should one, if the existing test "M*int(4)==M" is good enough?
