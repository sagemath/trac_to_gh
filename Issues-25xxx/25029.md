Assuming you talk about

```
if check and not p.is_prime():

this is to check that the input makes sense. Potentially, primality check is expensive,
and so for performance reasons one might want to avoid it.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Great, that makes sense. 

Another small thing, depending on the types of fields I construct I'm getting errors of the type 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic' 
object has no attribute 'is_padic_square'
```

or 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement_absolute' 
object has no attribute 'is_padic_square'
```

does this mean the function just needs to be added onto some call list?

Oh geez, I am, but I forgot to build Sage.  It's the jet-lag talking :/

I think this code looks good and I'm ready to give it a positive review.
