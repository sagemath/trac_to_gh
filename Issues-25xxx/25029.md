Assuming you talk about

```
if check and not p.is_prime():
```
this is to check that the input makes sense. Potentially, primality check is expensive,
and so for performance reasons one might want to avoid it.

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic'

or 

```

does this mean the function just needs to be added onto some call list?
