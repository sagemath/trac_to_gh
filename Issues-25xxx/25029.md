I settled for `is_padic_square` as that exists already for QQ.

`@`sbrandhorst at the suggestion of dimpase I'm going to review this ticket. Some comments:

- Sorry, but I'm not sure I understand the utility of the check=true variable in the function, what is that doing?
- In the modifications you added to quadratic defect there is a `P` that should be a `p`. 
- I ran the doctests, all tests passed.

Assuming you talk about

```
if check and not p.is_prime():
```
this is to check that the input makes sense. Potentially, primality check is expensive,
and so for performance reasons one might want to avoid it.

Great, that makes sense. 

Another small thing, depending on the types of fields I construct I'm getting errors of the type 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic' 
object has no attribute 'is_padic_square'
```

or 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement_absolute' 
object has no attribute 'is_padic_square'
```

does this mean the function just needs to be added onto some call list?

Oh geez, I am, but I forgot to build Sage.  It's the jet-lag talking :/

I think this code looks good and I'm ready to give it a positive review.
