Assuming you talk about

```
if check and not p.is_prime():
```
this is to check that the input makes sense. Potentially, primality check is expensive,
and so for performance reasons one might want to avoid it.

Another small thing, depending on the types of fields I construct I'm getting errors of the type 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic'

or 

```
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement_absolute'

does this mean the function just needs to be added onto some call list?
