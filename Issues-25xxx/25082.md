The symbolic power of a matrix was requested and discussed in
[Ask Sage question 25658](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35658/general-power-of-a-matrix/),
and implemented in #22523.

That implementation works in basic cases (diagonalizable case, two by two case, ...).

As reported in
[Ask Sage question 41622](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/41622/bug-in-general-power-of-a-matrix)
though, it fails in some cases.

The reason is that the general matrix power is computed on the Jordan form of the matrix,
but the k-th block was placed at (k, k), which is incorrect if a Jordan block of size at least two
occurs in any position but the last.

This ticket implements the fix suggested in an answer to Ask Sage question 41622.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: n = SR.var('n')
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 3, [[2, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]); A
sage: B = A^n; B
[        2^n 2^(n - 1)*n           0]
[          0         3^n           0]
[          0           0           0]
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: B = A^n; B
[        2^n 2^(n - 1)*n           0]
[          0         2^n           0]
[          0           0         3^n]
```
