It would be nice, because we typically do this in other cases.  But I guess since in this case it is an actual exception raised, as opposed to a wrong result we had to work around, it is not necessary.

But if Volker complains about failing doctests, I am trusting your morally green patchbot :-) Just upgraded OS (still several versions behind) and so won't be building new Sage for a little while until I have time to check that command line tools are working properly.
