1. Generic stuff like processing the `parent` should be done by the base class (`matrix0.Matrix` in this case) instead of by each derived class individually. This means that we will require that the first argument of every matrix constructor is the parent. Because of #25511, this is currently true everywhere.

2. In some cases, `__cinit__` calls `__init__` of the base class. That is really backwards and should never be needed!

This is a requirement for #23719.
