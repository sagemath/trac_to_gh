The method `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.LLL` accepts extra keywords, which are supposed to be passed to `fpylll` in case `fplll` is used.  However, these are currently ignored.  

The `kwds` argument could be used to request `LLL` to return the transformation matrix to the LLL-reduced basis instead of the basis itself.  Perhaps a better solution would be to remove `kwds` and to add a separate argument for such a flag.

See also #12050.

the branch say that returning the transform is not implemented in NTL, but IMHO it does, as I [wrote](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/lh-mgZYoxxA/m/a0-1QRMCCgAJ):

```
row=16
col=10
tt=cputime()
A = random_matrix(ZZ,  row,col,x=-2000, y=2000)
fl=flatten(list(map(list,list(A))))
M=ntl.mat_ZZ(row,col,fl)
tt=cputime(); rr=M.LLL(return_U=True); cputime(tt)
```

you can read in `M.LLL?` that

```
   If return_U is True, a value U is returned which is the
   transformation matrix, so that U is a unimodular m x m matrix with
   U * old-self = new-self. Note that the first m-r rows of U form a
   basis (as a lattice) for the kernel of old-B.
```
