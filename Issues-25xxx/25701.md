Sieve algorithm can be used for enumeration of rational points, when product projective space is over a `RationalField`. This would be much faster than basic enumeration.

Doing LLL reduction per component did work fine. But it performs very poor on small examples. Consider this:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import \
                enum_product_projective_number_field
sage: from sage.schemes.product_projective.rational_point import sieve
sage: PP.<x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3,z1,z2,z3> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2,2], QQ)
sage: X = PP.subscheme([x1+x2+x3,y1+y2+y3,z1+z2+z3])
sage: sieve(X,1)
sage: enum_product_projective_rational_field(X,1)
```

Basic enumeration turns out to be extremely efficient. However for larger bound, sieve works good.

I have pushed a branch for the same

Value of B is calculated from the component projective space, whose dimension is maximum

```python
dim_max = max(P[i].dimension() for i in range(num_comp))
B = RR(2**(dim_max/4+1)*bound**2*(dim_max+1).sqrt())
```
Since that would be the upper bound for all other components as well.

Yes Sir, I agree with that, it should be Pmax<sup>dim_ambient_space</sup> by looking at the rational point function for the finite field. I have added some other corrections in complexity as well

```C++
T(n) = (dim**2)*Pmax**(dim) + (dim_max**5 * (alpha/Pmax)**dim_scheme)
# it is (alpha/Pmax)^dim_scheme, since only that many points will
# be checked parallelly.
# instead of N^5, it would be dim_max^5, since we do LLL() over 
# each component, hence only the dim_max would be leading term
```

I have tested this branch, it has shown good improvement, however for smaller bounds (< 4), the enumeration is better. How about changing rational point logic according to this?
