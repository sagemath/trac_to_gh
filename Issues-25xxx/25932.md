Some comments:

It seems excessive to first construct a list/tuple, which is then sorted:

```diff
         try:
-            return sorted(tuple(set(self))) < sorted(tuple(set(other)))
+            return sorted(self) < sorted(other)
         except TypeError:
-            return sorted([str(_) for _ in self]) < sorted([str(_) for _ in other])
+            return sorted(map(str,self)) < sorted(map(str, other))
```
(or you could just remove the list part of the latter). Actually, you may just want to explicitly call `self.__set` here too.

In the test for `face_iterator`, instead of `# random`, why not just sort the output (this makes the test more robust at detecting failures). Same for `n_cells`.

In the `_repr_`, why not sort the `vertices` by `str` for consistent output on Python3?

Beyond those, LGTM.

> I am starting to wonder how much we really need the vertices to be a tuple and not a set. Is there some reason for this? I feel like all of this extra sorting is making things more difficult to maintain than it should be.

I've started thinking about this. 

First, when I first implemented simplicial complexes, I wanted to view the vertices as forming a simplex, in which case the order matters. (I think it is important that, given a simplex, its nth face is well defined.) That's now how it's actually implemented – `self._vertex_set` is just a tuple – but that was part of the original philosphy.

Next, and more practically, sorting individual faces is necessary in a number of places, so doing it once, centrally, makes sense to me. I tried disabling the `sort_facets` argument: so that setting it has no effect, and lots of things broke. I might have to put sorting separately into `graph`, `fundamental_group`, `chain_complex`, and the method that converts simplicial complexes to simplicial sets. Spreading the sorting out makes it more likely that two different methods will use incompatible sortings, which will break things.

So if we want to go this route, we would need to have a new method which returns a set/list/iterable of some type of sorted faces, and then always use that. I've tried doing that, and I'm running into problems. I don't know if it's worth continuing.
