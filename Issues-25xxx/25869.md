This ticket implements a few shortcuts to define some manifolds.

With this ticket, n-sphere, torus, Minkowski and Kerr spacetime can be declared in just one line, which is convenient for casual users and future doctests or examples.

<a id='comment:1'></a>A more Pythonic way would be to have these be functions in a module and import the module (this is how most the other catalogs are done in Sage). So the new file you've created should be renames as something like `catalog.py` and imported in `manifolds/all.py` by

```
import .catalog as manifolds
```
Within the file, you should move the import

```
from sage.manifolds.manifold import Manifold
```
within each function. I might also consider masquerading the functions as classes by making them start with uppercase letters or breaking with Python conventions by capitalizing the proper names, but Sage doesn't really have a true convention for these things.

Also, typo: ```sng```, but I think the sign should also take an generic tuple of length 4.

I'm currently experiencing difficulties building the documentation (for no reason at all, it worked well last week), so i don't know if it build properly.

<a id='comment:11'></a>A few comments:
- In `src/sage/manifolds/catalog.py`, there is a reference to the class `ManifoldGenerator`, while no such class does exist.
- The example provided for `manifolds.Euclidean` is too short (a single line!). A slightly more illustrative example (3 lines) would be:

```
sage: E.<x, y, z> = manifolds.Euclidean()
sage: E
Euclidean space E^3
```
  You could add as well

```
sage: E.atlas()
[Chart (E^3, (x, y, z))]
sage: E.metric().display()
g = dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz
```
- Similarly the example of `manifolds.Sphere` could be extended to 

```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian submanifold S embedded in 
 3-dimensional differentiable manifold E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
sage: S.metric().display()
gamma = dth*dth + sin(th)^2 dph*dph
```
  By the way, shouldn't the (default) metric name should be `g` here (as in the other manifolds of the catalog)?
- The example for `manifolds.Kerr` should be extended as well, to something like:

```
sage: m, a = var('m, a')
sage: K = manifolds.Kerr(m, a)
sage: K
4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M
sage: K.atlas()
[Chart (M, (t, r, th, ph))]
sage: K.metric().display()
g = (2*m*r/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) - 1) dt*dt 
 + 2*a*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dt*dph 
 + (a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2)/(a^2 - 2*m*r + r^2) dr*dr 
 + (a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dth*dth 
 + 2*a*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dph*dt
 + (2*a^2*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) + a^2 + r^2)*sin(th)^2 dph*dph
``` 
- Using 

```
sage: m, a = var('m, a')
sage: K.<t, r, th, ph> = manifolds.Kerr(m, a)
```
  leads to wrong coordinate ranges:

```
sage: K.default_chart().coord_range()
t: (-oo, +oo); r: (-oo, +oo); th: (-oo, +oo); ph: (-oo, +oo)
```
- The example for `manifolds.Torus` should be extended to something like:

```
sage: T.<theta, phi> = manifolds.Torus(3,1)
sage: T
2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian submanifold M embedded in 
 3-dimensional differentiable manifold E^3
sage: T.atlas()
[Chart (M, (theta, phi))]
sage: T.embedding().display()
M --> E^3
   (theta, phi) |--> (x_0, x_1, x_2) = ((cos(theta) + 3)*cos(phi), 
                                        (cos(theta) + 3)*sin(phi), 
                                        sin(theta))
sage: T.metric().display()
gamma = dtheta*dtheta + (cos(theta)^2 + 6*cos(theta) + 9) dphi*dphi
```
- In the code for `manifolds.Torus`, replace 

```
xnames = tuple(["x_{}".format(i) for i in range(3)])
E = Euclidean(names=xnames)
```
  by 

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3, symbols='X Y Z')
```
- Similarly, in the code for `manifolds.Sphere`, replace

```
xnames = ("X","Y","Z")
E = Euclidean(names=xnames)
```
  by

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3, symbols='X Y Z')
```
- In the code of `manifolds.Minkowski`, the structure should be `Lorentzian` instead of `pseudo-Riemannian`:

```
M = Manifold(4, 'M', structure='Lorentzian')
```

Thanks Travis for the changes! I'm 100% fine with them. In the commit  of comment:15, I've made a few very small tweaks + the change of "ADM" to "Kerr" for the second coordinate system of Kerr spacetime, since "Kerr" is the common name in the literature for such coordinates. From my point of view, the ticket is ready to go.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Reading your comment:1, I am realizing that I've probably made a mistake by removing

```
from sage.manifolds.manifold import Manifold
```
from each function to put it at the top of the file...
Similar thing for `EuclideanSpace`...

(well in the current case, both `Manifold` and `EuclideanSpace` should already be imported in the global namespace, but for clarity, we should make all the imports in `catalog.py` be local to the functions, shouldn't we?)

This is corrected in the last commit.
