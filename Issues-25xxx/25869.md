This ticket implements a few shortcuts to define some manifolds.

With this ticket, n-sphere, torus, Minkowski and Kerr spacetime can be declared in just one line, which is convenient for casual users and future doctests or examples.

A more Pythonic way would be to have these be functions in a module and import the module (this is how most the other catalogs are done in Sage). So the new file you've created should be renames as something like `catalog.py` and imported in `manifolds/all.py` by

```
import .catalog as manifolds
```
Within the file, you should move the import

```
from sage.manifolds.manifold import Manifold
```
within each function. I might also consider masquerading the functions as classes by making them start with uppercase letters or breaking with Python conventions by capitalizing the proper names, but Sage doesn't really have a true convention for these things.

Also, typo: <code>\`\`sng\`\`</code>, but I think the sign should also take an generic tuple of length 4.

I changed it according to your remarks. I originally used the file `surface3d_generators.py` as an example, but i didn't realize it was an exception.

I'm currently experiencing difficulties building the documentation (for no reason at all, it worked well last week), so i don't know if it build properly.

Many thanks for introducing a manifold catalog, at last!

A short comment: to avoid any confusion and code duplication, I would remove `Euclidean` from the catalog, since Euclidean spaces can now be easily constructed with `EuclideanSpace`, as implemented in #24623 (merged in Sage 8.3.beta0). Or even better, `manifolds.Euclidean()` could return an object of class `EuclideanSpace` (possibly of the subclasses `EuclideanPlane` or `Euclidean3dimSpace`).

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

A few comments:
- In `src/sage/manifolds/catalog.py`, there is a reference to the class `ManifoldGenerator`, while no such class does exist.
- The example provided for `manifolds.Euclidean` is too short (a single line!). A slightly more illustrative example (3 lines) would be:

```
sage: E.<x, y, z> = manifolds.Euclidean()
sage: E
Euclidean space E^3
```
  You could add as well

```
sage: E.atlas()
[Chart (E^3, (x, y, z))]
sage: E.metric().display()
g = dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz
```
- Similarly the example of `manifolds.Sphere` could be extended to 

```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian submanifold S embedded in 
 3-dimensional differentiable manifold E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
sage: S.metric().display()
gamma = dth*dth + sin(th)^2 dph*dph
```
  By the way, shouldn't the (default) metric name should be `g` here (as in the other manifolds of the catalog)?
- The example for `manifolds.Kerr` should be extended as well, to something like:

```
sage: m, a = var('m, a')
sage: K = manifolds.Kerr(m, a)
sage: K
4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M
sage: K.atlas()
[Chart (M, (t, r, th, ph))]
sage: K.metric().display()
g = (2*m*r/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) - 1) dt*dt 
 + 2*a*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dt*dph 
 + (a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2)/(a^2 - 2*m*r + r^2) dr*dr 
 + (a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dth*dth 
 + 2*a*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) dph*dt
 + (2*a^2*m*r*sin(th)^2/(a^2*cos(th)^2 + r^2) + a^2 + r^2)*sin(th)^2 dph*dph
``` 
- Using 

```
sage: m, a = var('m, a')
sage: K.<t, r, th, ph> = manifolds.Kerr(m, a)
```
  leads to wrong coordinate ranges:

```
sage: K.default_chart().coord_range()
t: (-oo, +oo); r: (-oo, +oo); th: (-oo, +oo); ph: (-oo, +oo)
```
- The example for `manifolds.Torus` should be extended to something like:

```
sage: T.<theta, phi> = manifolds.Torus(3,1)
sage: T
2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian submanifold M embedded in 
 3-dimensional differentiable manifold E^3
sage: T.atlas()
[Chart (M, (theta, phi))]
sage: T.embedding().display()
M --> E^3
   (theta, phi) |--> (x_0, x_1, x_2) = ((cos(theta) + 3)*cos(phi), 
                                        (cos(theta) + 3)*sin(phi), 
                                        sin(theta))
sage: T.metric().display()
gamma = dtheta*dtheta + (cos(theta)^2 + 6*cos(theta) + 9) dphi*dphi
```
- In the code for `manifolds.Torus`, replace 

```
xnames = tuple(["x_{}".format(i) for i in range(3)])
E = Euclidean(names=xnames)
```
  by 

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3, symbols='X Y Z')
```
- Similarly, in the code for `manifolds.Sphere`, replace

```
xnames = ("X","Y","Z")
E = Euclidean(names=xnames)
```
  by

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3, symbols='X Y Z')
```
- In the code of `manifolds.Minkowski`, the structure should be `Lorentzian` instead of `pseudo-Riemannian`:

```
M = Manifold(4, 'M', structure='Lorentzian')
```

Reading your [comment:1](#comment%3A1), I am realizing that I've probably made a mistake by removing

```
from sage.manifolds.manifold import Manifold
```
from each function to put it at the top of the file...
Similar thing for `EuclideanSpace`...

(well in the current case, both `Manifold` and `EuclideanSpace` should already be imported in the global namespace, but for clarity, we should make all the imports in `catalog.py` be local to the functions, shouldn't we?)

This is corrected in the last commit.
