We currently patch cddlib to replace `rand()` with a GNU implementation. The idea seems to be to get the same random numbers on all platforms (I could not really find which platform this was done for but I saw some things related to Solaris in the surroundings.)

If we really want to get stable random numbers for doctesting there, we should probably use a preload hack to fix `rand()` everywhere, see https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/ to get the idea.
