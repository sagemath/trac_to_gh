While implementing some algorithm involving projective spaces, I noticed that 90% of the time was simply spent enumerating the points of a projective space.

This branch speeds up the iteration ~5x on this example:

```
sage: PS = ProjectiveSpace(3, GF(71))
sage: %time L = list(PS)
CPU times: user 2.32 s, sys: 27.3 ms, total: 2.35 s
Wall time: 2.35 s
```
vs before

```
CPU times: user 10.6 s, sys: 18.2 ms, total: 10.6 s
Wall time: 10.6 s
```
Basically I avoid the checks, as well as more directly call the corresponding constructor since none of the points will by infinity. Feel free to merge this with your other cleanup stuff.

The element constructors for affine and projetive space are very slow.  They go back to the very early days of Sage when this sort of thing was done in a very highbrow schemey way, at the expense of speed.  For example

```
sage: F = GF(73)                                                                                                                                      
sage: %time L = list(cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)]))                                                                               
CPU times: user 189 ms, sys: 24.1 ms, total: 213 ms
Wall time: 212 ms
sage: A = AffineSpace(F,3)                                                                                                                            
sage: %time L = [A(v) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]

sage: len(L)                                                                                                                                          
389017
```
So calling the constructor 389000 times results in a 10s run time.  Using `A.point(v)` is not much better, but with check=False we do gain:

```
sage: %time L = [A.point(v) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]                                                               
CPU times: user 9.07 s, sys: 47.8 ms, total: 9.12 s
Wall time: 9.12 s
sage: %time L = [A.point(v, check=False) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]                                                  
CPU times: user 3 s, sys: 64 ms, total: 3.07 s
Wall time: 3.07 s
```

So we could replace the current iterator for affine space over a finite field with this:

```
def aff_iter(A):
    F = A.base_ring()
    d = A.dimension()
    for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(d)]):
        yield A.point(v, check=False)
```
and now

```
sage: %time L=list(aff_iter(A))                                                                                                                       
CPU times: user 2.62 s, sys: 60.1 ms, total: 2.68 s
Wall time: 2.68 s
```

Similarly for projective space, here is a new iterator, using the affine one:

```
def proj_iter(P):
    F = P.base_ring()
    d = P.dimension()
    one = (F.one(),)
    zero = (F.zero(),)
    for k in range(d+1): # position of last 1 before the 0's
        for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(k)]):
            yield P.point(v + one + zero*(d-k), check=False)
```
after which

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(GF(73), 3)                                                                                                                  
sage: %time oldL=list(P)                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 11.6 s, sys: 63.8 ms, total: 11.6 s
Wall time: 11.6 s
sage: %time L=list(proj_iter(P))                                                                                                                      
CPU times: user 2.31 s, sys: 76.3 ms, total: 2.38 s
Wall time: 2.38 s
sage: Set(L)==Set(oldL)                                                                                                                               
True
```

I think my code is a lot easier to read than the old version, or the proposed adjustment to it -- shall we replace these two iterator methods with new version based on what I wrote?

I made te changes I suggesed for both affine and projective space.  A small number of doctest outputs had to be changed since the order of iteration is now different, though I adjusted the code from what I had posted here to make the changes fewer.

For the original time tests, on the machine I was using we have the old version (9.2)

```
sage: PS = ProjectiveSpace(3, GF(71))                                                                                                                 
sage: %time L = list(PS)                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 9.98 s, sys: 51.3 ms, total: 10 s
Wall time: 10 s
```
and the new

```
sage: PS = ProjectiveSpace(3, GF(71))                                                                                                                 
sage: %time L = list(PS)                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 3.09 s, sys: 56.1 ms, total: 3.14 s
Wall time: 3.14 s
```
which I know is not so good a speedup as before.  If someone else wants to try to improve it further, they are welcome, but the time is all in the 363024 calls to the point constructor which is slow even with check-False.  (For this reason, the class for points on elliptic curves is not a specialization of the scheme point class -- it is rather ridiculous that it takes so long to construct a point when you do not even check that equations are satisfied.)

By the way, one thing I tried which definitely did not work is to construct one point outside the loop and then only assign its coordinates in the loop before yielding it.  The result is that all the points delivered are the same (pointers).  Adding in a copy() calls the constructor again...

The commit I made in u/cremona/25743 builds on the previous branch here, so it has Frédéric's tidying up in the projective_space file, but I did not do similar in the affine_space file.

So ~19% of the time is spent in the

```
sage.schemes.generic.homset.SchemeHomset_generic.__call__
```
most likely because of the

```python
from sage.structure.parent import Set_generic
```
local import. So just moving that to the top of the file makes it go from 3.5s to 3s (via `%prun`).

Next, I just avoided the intermediate step through the homset's `_element_constructor_` and just built the point directly.

I also do some other changes to be more lazily about stuff. I strongly suspect the `(co)domain` attributes of `SchemeMorphism` can be standard morphisms with maybe an added `_domain`. So these are now both ~2x faster for me. Although it seems like it makes more sense to have `_point` be an attribute to the class, which will shave off even more time.

I am not quite sure what you are suggesting here. Are you saying the current version is sufficient or is there something else to be done?

I did just notice that Frédéric's cleanup did not get merged in. I will do this on Monday (unless someone else does it first). So I am just temporarily reverting the positive review until I do that.
