While implementing some algorithm involving projective spaces, I noticed that 90% of the time was simply spent enumerating the points of a projective space.

<a id='comment:6'></a>The element constructors for affine and projetive space are very slow.  They go back to the very early days of Sage when this sort of thing was done in a very highbrow schemey way, at the expense of speed.  For example

```
sage: F = GF(73)                                                                                                                                      
sage: %time L = list(cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)]))                                                                               
CPU times: user 189 ms, sys: 24.1 ms, total: 213 ms
Wall time: 212 ms
sage: A = AffineSpace(F,3)                                                                                                                            
sage: %time L = [A(v) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]                                                                     
CPU times: user 10.8 s, sys: 47.9 ms, total: 10.8 s
Wall time: 10.8 s
sage: len(L)                                                                                                                                          
389017
```
So calling the constructor 389000 times results in a 10s run time.  Using `A.point(v)` is not much better, but with check=False we do gain:

```
sage: %time L = [A.point(v) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]                                                               
CPU times: user 9.07 s, sys: 47.8 ms, total: 9.12 s
Wall time: 9.12 s
sage: %time L = [A.point(v, check=False) for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(3)])]                                                  
CPU times: user 3 s, sys: 64 ms, total: 3.07 s
Wall time: 3.07 s
```

So we could replace the current iterator for affine space over a finite field with this:

```
def aff_iter(A):
    F = A.base_ring()
    d = A.dimension()
    for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(d)]):
        yield A.point(v, check=False)
```
and now

```
sage: %time L=list(aff_iter(A))                                                                                                                       
CPU times: user 2.62 s, sys: 60.1 ms, total: 2.68 s
Wall time: 2.68 s
```

Similarly for projective space, here is a new iterator, using the affine one:

```
def proj_iter(P):
    F = P.base_ring()
    d = P.dimension()
    one = (F.one(),)
    zero = (F.zero(),)
    for k in range(d+1): # position of last 1 before the 0's
        for v in cartesian_product_iterator([F for _ in range(k)]):
            yield P.point(v + one + zero*(d-k), check=False)
```
after which

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(GF(73), 3)                                                                                                                  
sage: %time oldL=list(P)                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 11.6 s, sys: 63.8 ms, total: 11.6 s
Wall time: 11.6 s
sage: %time L=list(proj_iter(P))                                                                                                                      
CPU times: user 2.31 s, sys: 76.3 ms, total: 2.38 s
Wall time: 2.38 s
sage: Set(L)==Set(oldL)                                                                                                                               
True
```

I think my code is a lot easier to read than the old version, or the proposed adjustment to it -- shall we replace these two iterator methods with new version based on what I wrote?

Will do. Since the new iterators will deliver the elements in a different order I'll be sure to check all doctests.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I made te changes I suggesed for both affine and projective space.  A small number of doctest outputs had to be changed since the order of iteration is now different, though I adjusted the code from what I had posted here to make the changes fewer.

For the original time tests, on the machine I was using we have the old version (9.2)

```
sage: PS = ProjectiveSpace(3, GF(71))                                                                                                                 
sage: %time L = list(PS)

```
and the new

```

The commit I made in u/cremona/25743 builds on the previous branch here, so it has Frédéric's tidying up in the projective_space file, but I did not do similar in the affine_space file.

I am not quite sure what you are suggesting here. Are you saying the current version is sufficient or is there something else to be done?

I did just notice that Frédéric's cleanup did not get merged in. I will do this on Monday (unless someone else does it first). So I am just temporarily reverting the positive review until I do that.
