The function computing the Euler factors of a hypergeometric motive has embedded in it a formula (imported from Magma) for the sign of the functional equation. The goal of this ticket is to expose this formula as a separate method.

Component: **modular forms**

Keywords: **hypergeometric motives, functional equation**
