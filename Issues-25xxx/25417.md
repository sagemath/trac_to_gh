This ticket implements two new attributes of tensor fields on manifolds used to improve the restriction operation, by using rudimentary graph exploration to check for existing restriction and extensions.

Previously, defining the restriction of a tensor field on a subset V of a subset U before the restriction on the subset U would not register the first tensor as a restriction of the second, resulting in the creation of two python objects, despite being mathematically identical.

An example of code reproducing this behavior can be seen on this [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/submanifolds/Extension_demo.ipynb?flush_cache=true). With this ticket, the order of creation no longer matters.

This is part of the â€‹[SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/); see the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

LGTM.
Simply, could you add some Python comments in lines 426-427 of `tensorfield.py` regarding the meaning of the new attributes `_extensions_graph` and `_restrictions_graph`? This would be helpfull, especially since, technically speaking, these attributes are not graphs, but dictionaries.
