```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: E.some_elements()
[x^y + 2*x + 3*y + 1]
```
`x^y` can easily be misinterpreted.

Instead, let's use `x/\y` for the product, both in the string representation and ascii art. Use a wedge symbol ("logical and") in unicode art.

IMO, this is not a good argument as we do not generally have this (almost any `Parent` falls into this).

Having `^` is much closer to a wedge product, which is the common math notation, and technically, that should be bitwise or, so `2^3 == 8` is also technically ambiguous. (However, that is not meant to be a real counterargument as `^` is semantically exponentiation in Sage.)

So I can understand where the confusion comes from. If you want to change it to `x*y`, then I can accept that (the other ascii art version would be `x/\y`).

Unrelated, this made me come across a missing feature of a good `ascii_art` and `unicode_art` for the exterior algebra.

It is *a* common math notation, but often when I see exterior algebras used in real life, I just see `xy` for the product of `x` and `y`.

Since `^` is so common for "action on the right" (which a wedge product between vectors definitely isn't), I'd say even for Ascii art, using `^` for wedge is a bad idea. It's just too common to consider some wedge space as a left-G-module for some group (e.g., a Galois group).

I think `/\` for ascii art is good, but for the standard output, I am more inclined to have `*`. I feel it is less heavy-handed in the output, there is the benefit of copy/pasting output as input, and it "fits" the other common notation of just standard multiplication.
