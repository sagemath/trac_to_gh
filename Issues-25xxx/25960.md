There are some minor issues with documentation for toggling/rowmotion/birational rowmotion methods that live in categories/finite_posets.py , because they refer to the methods order_ideal_toggle() and order_ideal_toggles() as if they live in the same file (but they actually live in categories/posets.py).

Ready for review, should only be three lines changed, review should pretty much only entail building the new doc and making sure that the reference links exist. I believe the doc may need to be built from scratch, it does not appear that incremental documentation builds recognize this minor of a change.
