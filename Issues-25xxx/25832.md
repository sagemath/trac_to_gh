mainly inside loops.

* This is faster
* This does not sort the vertices

Inspired by ##22349

Found using

```
git grep "for.*\.vertices()" src/sage/quivers/
git grep "for.*\.vertices()" src/sage/combinat/
```

<a id='comment:18'></a>A few comments in `quiver.py`:
* Apparently, you can replace `set(frozen).issubset(set(data.vertex_iterator()))` by `set(frozen).issubset(data.vertex_iterator())`.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: set([1,2]).issubset(G.vertex_iterator())
True
sage: set([1,10]).issubset(G.vertex_iterator())
False
```

* I don't know the size of `mlist` in this code, but it might be interesting to first convert it to a set before doing `nlist = self._nlist = sorted(x for x in data.vertex_iterator() if x not in mlist)`

* `if any((a,a) in edges for a in data.vertex_iterator()):` -> `if data.has_loops():`. Furthermore, the list `edges` could be turned to a set for the next test (2-cycles).

* There are places where you could replace `edges()` by `edge_iterator()`, but may be you prefer to let that for another ticket.

* and finally, the following block 

```
if dg.has_multiple_edges():
    multi_edges = {}
    for v1,v2,label in dg.multiple_edges():
        ...
```
  could be changed to

```
multiple_edges = dg.multiple_edges()
if multiple_edges:
    multi_edges = {}
    for v1,v2,label in multiple_edges:
        ....
```
  Indeed, the cost of `has_multiple_edges` is almost the same as `multiple_edges`, that is visiting all the edges. So we can save one call.
