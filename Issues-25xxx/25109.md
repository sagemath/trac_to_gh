You have to touch configure.ac if you want to test whether there is a system wide install. But we don't do that for real "optional" packages (as in we always need gcc, yasm and curl anyway). So there would be a bit of a challenge there.

\\
I don't really see how to do this. What do we want exactly ?\\

If `cmake` is already installed (system wide) and is a dependencie of another sage package we don't want `cmake` sage package to be installed.\\

But in the case above should `sage -i cmake` still work ?
