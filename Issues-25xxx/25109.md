It is via `bootstrap` file. What is missing exactly ?

\\
I don't really see how to do this. What do we want exactly ?\\

If `cmake` is already installed (system wide) and is a dependencie of another sage package we don't want `cmake` sage package to be installed.\\

But in the case above should `sage -i cmake` still work ?

Yes, this is what we want.

Yes, as `sage -i gcc`.
