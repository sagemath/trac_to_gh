It seems from the code that the error message should be "Input (di)graph must be (strongly) connected.", but in reality `DiGraph(2).distance_matrix()` outputs `KeyError: 1`.

Comes from:

```
sage: dg = DiGraph(2)
sage: dg.distance_all_pairs()
{0: {0: 0}, 1: {1: 0}}
```
where infinite distances are not inserted in the double dict.

We do, try `Matrix(RR, [[Infinity, -Infinity], [42, 0]])`, but I don't suggest using that. I just suggest making the right error message to appear, as I wondered this for a while today.

In this patch, you should add a connectivity test prior to the call to `distance_all_pairs`. It will be faster and cleaner.

If you want to return a matrix even if the graph is not (strongly)connected, then all distances should be set to `Infinity`.


There is a significant amount of work to be done for cleaning and unifying distance related methods. 
- The usage of weights (and the parameters) must be unified. We should have a method to check the consistency of weights with respect an input weight function. Currently, it is done inside several methods in different ways.
- The `distance_matrix` method is for unweighted graphs only. It could be extended to weighted graphs. Also, this method transforms a dict of dicts to a matrix which is in my opinion very bad (consumes a lot of memory and slow down computations with extra transformations). We could go directly from low level representation to matrix when using a Cython or C++ implementation.
- etc.

- for the error message `Input (di)graph must be (strongly) connected.`, I though it should not start with a capital letter and not have a `.` at the end, but may be I misunderstood some rules.

- Do you think that the description of the method is clear enough ? For me, this can be confusing: `whose rows and columns are indexed with the vertices` but this is not correct. Indeed, the ith row corresponds to the ith vertex in the ordering of `G.vertices()`, but `G.vertices()[i]` can be something else like `'a'`. 

  We could change like that

```
The distance matrix of a (strongly) connected (di)graph is a matrix
whose rows and columns are indexed with the positions of the vertices
of the (di)graph in the ordering ``G.vertices()``. The intersection
of a row and a column contains the respective distance between the
vertices indexed at these positions.
```
