The following is almost instantaneous

```
sage: Permutations(20).unrank(2**60)
[10, 11, 2, 8, 14, 20, 5, 17, 16, 6, 9, 19, 1, 15, 13, 3, 12, 18, 4, 7]
```
but the following (which should be the same) takes forever

```
sage: Permutations(range(20)).unrank(2**60)
```

So this is because `Permutations(range(20))` is a completely different object/implementation and does not use the `StandardPermtutations`. IMO, what should happen is the generic permutations code should just be an adapter to `StandardPermutations` with labels.
