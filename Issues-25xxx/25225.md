The `boost::coroutine` headers are included in boost_cropped but the functionality needs library support, as a small program demonstrates. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13604090/which-boost-libraries-are-header-only

There are headers in `boost_cropped` that are usable without library, so it should contain only those.

No. When I need it in Pynac I'll do an experimental Pynac package dependent on full boost, first. BTW full boost does not build on clang+linux.
