There are headers in `boost_cropped` that are usable without library, so it should contain only those.

No. When I need it in Pynac I'll do an experimental Pynac package dependent on full boost, first. BTW full boost does not build on clang+linux.

I plan to upgrade boost/boost_cropped at some point and it was part of that. Looking at it, it may need some love on OS X where gcc may not be what it seems.

Regarding `boost_cropped` I don't think anyone ever bothered figuring which bits are usable without libraries. Do you think it is difficult?
