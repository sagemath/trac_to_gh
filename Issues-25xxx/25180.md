These fixes are mostly (entirely?) to code that is deprecated since #20695.  However, that was only merged fairly recently, so probably won't be removed for a while, so it still needs to be fixed if we want the Python 3 tests passing sooner rather than later.

Porting these fixes to the now external surface_dynamics package is tracked at
