Maybe you should add an optional argument to allow naming the variables used in the polynomial ring.

In the case where the `base_ring not in (QQ, RR, ZZ)` I would find it more convenient to also output the actual value of the argument?

In the for loop, you might want to use the `enumerate(v)` function.
