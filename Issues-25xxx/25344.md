and use cddexec instead of cdd_both_reps. cddexec should be faster and is, according to upstream, "done the right way". The change to cddexec and the version upgrade make some numerical issues visible, so some things that worked before are not supported anymore. Additionally, we now require an inexact redundancy-free representation to be convertible back and forth between V and H representation (without loss of vertices/inequalities) before we trust it. Some standard examples, fail this check. I can not really make the call on whether these are bugs in cddlib or numerical issues that could not possibly be fixed (as I do not understand this well enough.)
    
So why this change? Mostly because we do not patch cddlib anymore and just use it as is. It is also faster in some cases (that's what upstream cared most about when the cddlib author heard about our cdd_both_reps,) e.g.,

```    
%timeit polytopes.six_hundred_cell(exact=False)
```
went from 993ms to 246ms
    
Some other examples see minor slowdowns because of the additional transformation that we compute initially to make sure that the conversion back and forth worked out.

Note that we also don't need the patched random number generator as upstream now uses a portable rng.

Don't modify positively reviewed tickets unless you have a reason. There was no merge conflict, so no need to do anything. I'll ignore the superfluous merge.

I needed a clean patch against 8.3 for Debian and Conda distribution so I decided to push the merge so that I can say in the packaging scripts that this is actually the patch exactly as it is going into upstream.

I am sorry if this caused some trouble for you. I didn't see the harm of merging in develop. What is the problem other than some noise here on the ticket?
