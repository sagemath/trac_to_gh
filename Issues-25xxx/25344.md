and use cddexec instead of cdd_both_reps. cddexec should be faster and is, according to upstream, "done the right way".

Additionally, we now require an inexact redundancy-free representation to be convertible back and forth between V and H representation (without loss of vertices/inequalities) before we trust it.

So why this change? Mostly because we do not patch cddlib anymore and just use it as is. It is also faster in some cases (that's what upstream cared most about when the cddlib author heard about our cdd_both_reps,) e.g.,

```    
%timeit polytopes.six_hundred_cell(exact=False)
```
went from 993ms to 246ms
    
Some other examples see minor slowdowns because of the additional transformation that we compute initially to make sure that the conversion back and forth worked out.

Note that we also don't need the patched random number generator as upstream now uses a portable rng.

The change to cddexec makes some numerical issues visible, so some things that worked before are not supported anymore. Essentially, we now require an inexact redundancy-free representation to be convertible back and forth between V and H representation (without loss of vertices/inequalities) before we trust it. Some standard examples, fail this check.

 So why this change? Mostly because we do not patch cddlib anymore and just use it as is. It is also faster in some cases (that's what upstream cared most about when the cddlib author heard about our cdd_both_reps,) e.g.,
