So why this change? Mostly because we do not patch cddlib anymore and just use it as is. It is also faster in some cases (that's what upstream cared most about when the cddlib author heard about our cdd_both_reps,) e.g.,

```    
%timeit polytopes.six_hundred_cell(exact=False)
```
went from 993ms to 246ms
    
Some other examples see minor slowdowns because of the additional transformation that we compute initially to make sure that the conversion back and forth worked out.

Note that we also don't need the patched random number generator as upstream now uses a portable rng.
