Fixed merge conflict with master, manually implemented the same code changes, and removed changes to deprecated code. Also have another test case:

```
K.<a>=QuadraticField(-1)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^4 + (-1+2*a)*x*y^3,y^4], domain=P)
f.is_postcritically_finite()

The following changed line's purpose is unclear to us. When we removed it, and changed the variable names, it seemed to still work well without it:

```
L = K.change_names('a')

Is this line still necessary?
