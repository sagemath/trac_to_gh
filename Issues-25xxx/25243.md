When the field extension needs to be extended there can be a conflict of variable names

```
sage: K.<v> = QuadraticField(-7)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^3 + v*x*y^2, y^3])
sage: fbar = f.change_ring(QQbar)
sage: fbar.is_postcritically_finite()

Fixed merge conflict with master, manually implemented the same code changes, and removed changes to deprecated code. Also have another test case:

```
K.<a>=QuadraticField(-1)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^4 + (-1+2*a)*x*y^3,y^4], domain=P)
f.is_postcritically_finite()

```

Is this line still necessary?
