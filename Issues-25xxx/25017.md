```
sage: u.subs({x0:1r, x1:2r})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

It would also be good to check that substituting **all** variables by some elements of a given multiplicative monoid does work

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(2)
sage: x0, x1 = F.gens()
sage: u = x0*x1
sage: u.subs({x0:3, x1:2})
6
sage: u.subs({x0: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,1,0,1]), x1: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,0,1,1])})
[2 1]
[1 1]
```

And note that if the universe is not a monoid you might get very strange behavior... but I don't think that we should worry about this.
