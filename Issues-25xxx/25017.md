I think that substitutions should be stricter (e.g. by computing a universe *before* the substitution)

```
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeGroup()
sage: F.one().subs(x=x, y=1)     # nonsense... but we get an answer

sage: parent(_)
Free Group on generators {x, y}

Better! Though you should not expect any object to have a `parent` method. You should here use the `parent` function (from `sage.structure.element`).

```
sage: u.subs({x0:1r, x1:2r})
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

It would also be good to check that substituting **all** variables by some elements of a given multiplicative monoid does work

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(2)
sage: x0, x1 = F.gens()
sage: u = x0*x1
sage: u.subs({x0:3, x1:2})
6
sage: u.subs({x0: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,1,0,1]), x1: matrix(ZZ, 2, [1,0,1,1])})
[2 1]
[1 1]
```

And note that if the universe is not a monoid you might get very strange behavior... but I don't think that we should worry about this.
