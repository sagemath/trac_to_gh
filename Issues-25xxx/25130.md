This seems to be a script for use within `build/pkgs` scripts, so it should go to `build/bin`.

I go back-and-forth on that.  I agree with your logic completely. But I think we need to talk about where installation-related files go for use "at runtime".  Because currently all build-related files live in `build/` but don't get "installed" into `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  And yet they are in a sense needed at "runtime" since a feature of Sage is the ability to install new packages--particularly optional packages.

So I think what we really need is overall better organization of what build-related files are needed at runtime and how to "install" those files in such a way that installing additional Sage packages doesn't necessarily depend on `$SAGE_ROOT`.

Under that rubrik I'm not sure the existence of `build/bin` even makes sense since most, if not all of those scripts are needed for optional package installation.

Sorry, I had to catch a flight.

The longer answer: I disagree with the notion of installation of optional packages being done "at runtime". There is no ticket that describes your goal of being able to install tickets even if $SAGE_ROOT is not present. Right now installation of optional packages does not even reliably work in binary distributions.

Alternatively, I have also mentioned that I don't like it in the first place that build-related commands (e.g. `sage -b` and the like) are built into the same runtime interface that users use to start and run Sage and associated commands.  

So I think there needs to be a clearer vision of what an arbitrary user should expect to be able to do from the `sage` command regardless of the context in which they're running it.

It wouldn't be expected, for example, in a Linux distribution's sage binary; sage's optional packages would probably be supplied by the distribution's package manager instead.

I see the "sage -i" as a mere convenience which "calls out to the SAGE_ROOT" to install a package.

On sage-on-gentoo `sage -i` is not offered. I am pushing slowly but surely for `is_package_installed` to be removed at runtime and in the more distant future at build time. doctesting and `is_package_installed` are also causing me some headaches.

For information this is sage-on-gentoo `misc/package.py` file [ https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-7.3-package.py].

And these are the commands that I ship if you request debugging and doctesting enabled

```

/usr/bin/sage-cachegrind
/usr/bin/sage-callgrind
/usr/bin/sage-cleaner

```

As for dealing with optional packages. In sage-on-distro we of course expect them to be installed by the distro's package manager. Not all optional packages may be on offer and filling that gap is hard. Debian has a massive amount of packages so they have a better starting point than me on this.

Next there is the problem that there are two categories of optional packages:
* runtime packages, the functionality will be available if the package is installed and it can be installed after sage. They are easy to deal with - you can just install them whenever, in a standard path, and they should work.
* build time packages. In the current system if those packages are found when sage is built, specific binding will be build for those packages. Those are the hard ones. If you want to support them they have to be part of your dependency tree.

Gentoo has useflags, I offer some built time optional packages through useflags. If you want any of `bliss`, `modular_decomposition`, `libbraiding` or `libhomfly` they can be enabled. `cbc` is hard and I failed to enable it once. 

Missing packages in that category are `mcqd`, `tdlib`, `coxeter3`, `fes`, `sirocco`, `meataxe` (not going to happen anytime soon, with all due respect, meataxe packaging sucks), `gurobi` (in its own category, it checks for presence differently from anyone else), `cplex` and `cbc` (the only extension to require lapack).

I'm concerned that this will be broken if `$SAGE_ROOT` contains spaces.  It probably *shouldn't* and I'm not sure that there aren't other things that break if that's the case.
