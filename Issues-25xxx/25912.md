Under some circumstances, `pkg-config` ends up executing itself.

This is the file `/home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/bin/pkg-config`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
    echo >&2 "This script requires that SAGE_LOCAL is set."
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" ]; then
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig:$SAGE_LOCAL/share/pkgconfig"
else
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig:$SAGE_LOCAL/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
fi



exec /home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/bin/pkg-config "$@"
```

The problem is that the m4 template that generates `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config` uses `command -v pkg-config` to get the path to the "actual" `pkg-config`, which ends up being a self-reference if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config` is already installed (which it shouldn't be, but it could be if something went wrong cleaning/upgrading the pkgconf spkg).

An easy workaround is to just make absolutely sure to remove `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config`.

I agree this should probably be fixed for 8.3.  I *think* an incremental upgrade direct from 8.2 to 8.3.rc2 should go smoothly, although I have not tested this.  But if someone is upgrading from a random earlier 8.3 beta or something it might not.  Fixing this now would head off a lot of likely support requests / failure reports, I suspect.

But I don't consider it a total blocker either, so I leave that up to Volker.
