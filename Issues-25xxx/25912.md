Under some circumstances, `pkg-config` ends up executing itself.

This is the file `/home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/bin/pkg-config`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
    echo >&2 "This script requires that SAGE_LOCAL is set."
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" ]; then
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig:$SAGE_LOCAL/share/pkgconfig"
else
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig:$SAGE_LOCAL/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
fi



exec /home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/bin/pkg-config "$@"
```
