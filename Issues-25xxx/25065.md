I have a DiGraph with isolated vertices and I want to turn it into a BipartiteGraph. It seems that the isolated vertices will be assigned to left no matter what I do.

```
sage: d = DiGraph(6); d.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sage: part = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]
sage: b = BipartiteGraph(d, part)
sage: b.left
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
sage: b.right
set()
```

In fact, I can specify something completely nonsensical as the partition and it will still be ignored.

```
sage: b2 = BipartiteGraph(d, partition=d)
sage: b2 == b
True
```

Casting the DiGraph as a Graph and then a BipartiteGraph works, however.

```
sage: d = DiGraph(6)
sage: part = [[0,1,2],[3,4,5]]
sage: g = Graph(d)
sage: b = BipartiteGraph(g, partition=part)
sage: b.left
{0, 1, 2}
sage: b.right
{3, 4, 5}
```

A `DiGraph` is not a `Graph` but they are both children of `GenericGraph`. One possible fix is the change the checks for `Graph` to checks for `GenericGraph`. All doctests in the graphs module pass when I try this.

Well, this module seriously lacks of documentation. All accepted input formats should be properly explained. For instance, I don't understand the description of the `reduced matrix format`:

```
A reduced adjacency matrix contains only the non-redundant portion of the
full adjacency matrix for the bipartite graph.  Specifically, for zero
matrices of the appropriate size, for the reduced adjacency matrix ``H``,
the full adjacency matrix is ``[[0, H'], [H, 0]]``.
```
Looking at the code, I understand that the left partition has one vertex per column and the right partition one vertex per row, and if cell `[j][i]` of the matrix is one, then there is an edge between left vertex `i` and right vertex `ncols+j`, where `ncols` is the number of left vertices. It's not obvious from the description.

That explains why ``partition`` doesn't work with matrix data. The documentation calls this a "reduced adjacency matrix". That's not something I was familiar with, but it makes sense for bipartite graphs.

I will fix this to work with DiGraphs, and improve the documentation a bit.
