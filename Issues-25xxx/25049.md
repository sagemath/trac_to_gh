```
-config
-if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
+# Run in a subshell in case config with X11 support fails
+if ! (config); then
     echo "Configuring R without X11"
     XSUPPORT=no
     config
-    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
-        echo >&2 "Error configuring R."
-        exit 1
-    fi
 fi
```
So we won't abort if the inner `config` fails here?
