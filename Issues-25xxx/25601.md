That looks like a Sage safety check to avoid infinite iteration, but I am not sure it is really an effective one. Actually, I am somewhat curious as to why this behavior changed from 2 to 3.
Interestingly, I get the same behavior on 2 and 3 with this:

```
>>> class Foo(object):
...     def __len__(self):
...         print("len")
...         return 5
...     def __iter__(self):
...         return iter(range(5))
... 
>>> F = Foo()
>>> list(F)
len
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
However, in Python2, the error is caught and things are allowed to proceed as normal for `__iter__`. In Python3, it is not caught and aborts the computation.

I would think the best solution would be to simply have `__len__` call `int(self.cardinality())` and let that error make its way up. Or remove it altogether and let the base class handle it.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):
> I agree that implementing `__len__` as `self.cardinality()` makes sense.

Actually, the default implementation of `cardinality()` is

```
    def cardinality(self):
        c = 0
        for _ in self:
            c += 1
        return c
```
and you don't want `__len__` (which is supposed to be fast) to call that.

So maybe we should just remove `__len__` completely instead of having it raise an `AttributeError`. I created #25605 for that.
