That looks like a Sage safety check to avoid infinite iteration, but I am not sure it is really an effective one. Actually, I am somewhat curious as to why this behavior changed from 2 to 3.
Interestingly, I get the same behavior on 2 and 3 with this:

```
>>> class Foo(object):
...     def __len__(self):
...         print("len")
...         return 5
...     def __iter__(self):
...         return iter(range(5))
... 
>>> F = Foo()
>>> list(F)
len
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
However, in Python2, the error is caught and things are allowed to proceed as normal for `__iter__`. In Python3, it is not caught and aborts the computation.

I would think the best solution would be to simply have `__len__` call `int(self.cardinality())` and let that error make its way up. Or remove it altogether and let the base class handle it.

Or remove it altogether and let the base class handle it.\n\nI'm guessing that `__len__` was \"removed\" because of a technical restriction that `__len__` must return a C `long`. So the answer cannot be an arbitrarily large integer nor infinity. I agree that implementing `__len__` as `self.cardinality()` makes sense. We should just check which what Cython does if this answer is either a large integer or infinity and add doctests.",

> I would think the best solution would be to simply have `__len__` call `int(self.cardinality())` and let that error make its way up. Or remove it altogether and let the base class handle it.

I'm guessing that `__len__` was "removed" because of a technical restriction that `__len__` must return a C `long`. So the answer cannot be an arbitrarily large integer nor infinity. I agree that implementing `__len__` as `self.cardinality()` makes sense. We should just check which what Cython does if this answer is either a large integer or infinity and add doctests.

Actually, the default implementation of `cardinality()` is

```
    def cardinality(self):
        c = 0
        for _ in self:
            c += 1
        return c
```
and you don't want `__len__` (which is supposed to be fast) to call that.

So maybe we should just remove `__len__` completely instead of having it raise an `AttributeError`. I created #25605 for that.
