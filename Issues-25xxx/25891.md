Why are you creating new files for these graphs ? can't you just add these generators in file `families.py` ? In general, we try to avoid adding new files unless there is a real need for it (easier for maintaining the code).

Also, this patch is build on top of #25802 (without indicating the dependency) but I have the feeling that this can be done independently.

I tried saving the `CaiFurerImmermanGraph` in a python file and in a cython file to see if it is more efficient. Honestly, the differnce is not big enough to justify adding a new cython file (and in particular a 10 lines cython file).

```
sage: %timeit CaiFurerImmermanGraph_pyx(18)
1 loop, best of 3: 6.5 s per loop
sage: %timeit CaiFurerImmermanGraph_py(18)
1 loop, best of 3: 6.86 s per loop
```
Note that you can write:

```
powerset = list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(range(k), r) for r in range(0, k+1, 2)))
```

I have not tried the `EgawaGraph` or the `HammingGraph`, but it should be exactly the same.

In input parameters of methods, avoid `X=[]` and prefer `X=None`.

Ok, everything you asked is done. Anyway, about the implementation, there's basically no speedup because the code for CaiFurerImmerman graphs is not yet optimised at all for Cython compilation, it's just a small sequence of itertools results passed to the methods of a Graph object.\\
In other cases, such as the Egawa graphs, it's quite more significant:

```
sage: %timeit EG_py(0,8)
1 loop, best of 3: 5.69 s per loop
sage: %timeit EG_pyx(0,8)
1 loop, best of 3: 3.91 s per loop
```

Which is not a lot, but still around 31%.\\\\
I didn't use the ` src/sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx.pyx` simply because there's only one method for a common random (di)graph, so I wasn't sure putting family generators there was inteneded usage.

I'm not really sure. It surely wasn't intentional, I must have done something wrong while writing the new code, but I don't really know how.
Anyway, I found a couple of these errors, and I should've fixed them all, thanks for spotting them!
Also, I deleted the old branch and uploaded a new one, incorporating the fix in the last commit.

A few suggestions for `EgawaGraph`:
- add an `INPUT:` block
- `Any Egawa graph with parameters (0, s)` -> `The Egawa graph with parameters (0, s)`
- You may add the reference of Agawa paper in file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` instead of putting link `https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(81)90007-8`. At least, use `:doi:`10.1016/0097-3165(81)90007-8``
- you don't need to import `DenseGraph`. not used
- since `Y` is a graph, instead of the loop `for el in Y:`, you can do a loop like `for el in Y.neighbor_iterator(v[i]):`. Then, you can directly construct `u`.
- same for the loop `for el in X:`
- `for j in range(s): ` -> `for i in range(p, p+s):`
- I'm not sure it is really useful to use set `used`.
- add test to check that input parameters are ok

A few suggestions for `HammingGraph`:
- add an `INPUT:` block
- add test to check that input parameters are ok
- you don't need to import `DenseGraph`. not used
- instead of having both `q` and `X`, you could have a single parameter `q` that could be either an integer, in which case you have `X = list(range(q))` or an iterable container (list, set, tuple, etc.) in which case you can do `X = list(q)`.
- you could add a link to the wikipedia page
- I don't think you need the set `used`. You can add several times the same edge.

In the documentation of all methods, since you use `r""" some text """`, you can write latex equations. For instance, instead of writing ``p` != 0`, write ``p \neq 0``. Write also ``X^n`` to get nicer html rendering.

I've set up my editor to only use spaces, it's so weird a few slipped through.\\
Anyway, the only ones I've found are in the graph_generators.py file, did you find any others?

I've made the changes you suggested, save for the one about the parameters X and q. I see what you mean when you say one could use only one paramers, but I feel like it would be confusing to be able to pass either an integer or an iterable under the same name, and it's not like X needs to be passed most of the time anyway.\\
I'll add a check for the input soon too, but first I want to decide if there is a need to have this .pyx file for generators who need more speed.\\
Talking with dimpase, he told me he would like to see one, but in this particular case, after refactoring the code a bit, all my generators take more or less the same amount of time, .pyx or not, because most of the time is spent creating the actual graph, not computing edges and vertices.\\
There is some improvement mind you, but it's less than 10%. What should I do? Both versions are included in this commit, so that anyone can check for themselves what I mean, I'll simply delete the not needed ones when a decision has been made.

You use type `bool`, but you could use `bint` instead (no need for import) as done in file `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph_pyx.pyx`.
You also import `string` but it is never used. You use type `str`.

Please format documentation in 80 columns mode.

In method `FurerGadget`:
- add an examples block
- I assume that `k` must be positive. What if `k==0` ? add a test.
- what is the expected type of `prefix` ? you could document that.
- you use `zip(...)`. With Python3, `zip` becomes an iterator. So if `Va = zip(...)`, you can iterate over `Va` only once. More precisely, after doing `G.add_vertices(Va)`, the operation `Va[i]` raises an error (in Python3). The solution here is to do `Va = list(zip(...))`.
- `rep(prefix, len(V_a))` -> `rep(prefix, k)`, no ?
- `for r in range(k+1) if r % 2 == 0` could be simply `for r in range(0, k+1, 2)`


In method `CaiFurerImmermanGraph`:
- in the documentation, you can write ``G`` instead of ```G``` to use latex.
- `F(v)` -> ``F(v)``
- add an examples block and possibly some tests.
- What if `G` is the empty graph ?
- `G.edges(labels=False)` -> `G.edge_iterator(labels=False)`
- The block `temp = edge_ua` is currently not correct as it sets `edge_ua` to it's initial value without touching `edge_ub`. I recommend to rewrite it in 1 line: `edge_ua, edge_ub = edge_ub, edge_ua`.

In method `EgawaGraph`:
- Returns -> Return
- add tests on `p` and `s`. Strictly positive ? 


In `HammingGraph`:
- `if None (or left unused)` -> `if ``None`` (or left unused)`. It's a general convention in documentation for `None`, `True` and `False`.
- add tests for the expected values of `n` and `q`.

Sorry to bother you with all these "details", but the cleaner the code, the easier it is to maintain.

Fixed everything, the graph G can be empty for a CaiFurerImmerman graph, it will simply return an equally empty graph.
Prefix can be anything, so it doesn't really matter.
And anyway, don't worry about it, I appreciate the attention to details, you're telling me things I couldn't have known by myself, thanks.

A choice must be done: either put the methods in `families.py` or in a new file `families_pyx.pyx`.
I don't see the advantage of the new `.pyx` file here, as the speed up improvement is rather limited, but I will not fight against it.

I have to say in this case I agree with you, there's not much use for it, as the bottleneck in basically any case is going to be the creation of the graph itself, but since I didn't want to choose by myself, I'll leave it for other reviewers to decide. \\
