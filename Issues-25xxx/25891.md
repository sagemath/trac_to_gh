Why are you creating new files for these graphs ? can't you just add these generators in file `families.py` ? In general, we try to avoid adding new files unless there is a real need for it (easier for maintaining the code).

Also, this patch is build on top of #25802 (without indicating the dependency) but I have the feeling that this can be done independently.

I tried saving the `CaiFurerImmermanGraph` in a python file and in a cython file to see if it is more efficient. Honestly, the differnce is not big enough to justify adding a new cython file (and in particular a 10 lines cython file).

```
sage: %timeit CaiFurerImmermanGraph_pyx(18)
1 loop, best of 3: 6.5 s per loop
sage: %timeit CaiFurerImmermanGraph_py(18)
1 loop, best of 3: 6.86 s per loop
```
Note that you can write:

```
powerset = list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(range(k), r) for r in range(0, k+1, 2)))
```

I have not tried the `EgawaGraph` or the `HammingGraph`, but it should be exactly the same.

In input parameters of methods, avoid `X=[]` and prefer `X=None`.

Ok, everything you asked is done. Anyway, about the implementation, there's basically no speedup because the code for CaiFurerImmerman graphs is not yet optimised at all for Cython compilation, it's just a small sequence of itertools results passed to the methods of a Graph object.\\
In other cases, such as the Egawa graphs, it's quite more significant:

```
sage: %timeit EG_py(0,8)
1 loop, best of 3: 5.69 s per loop
sage: %timeit EG_pyx(0,8)
1 loop, best of 3: 3.91 s per loop
```

Which is not a lot, but still around 31%.\\\\
I didn't use the ` src/sage/graphs/graph_generators_pyx.pyx` simply because there's only one method for a common random (di)graph, so I wasn't sure putting family generators there was inteneded usage.

I'm not really sure. It surely wasn't intentional, I must have done something wrong while writing the new code, but I don't really know how.
Anyway, I found a couple of these errors, and I should've fixed them all, thanks for spotting them!
Also, I deleted the old branch and uploaded a new one, incorporating the fix in the last commit.

A few suggestions for `EgawaGraph`:
- add an `INPUT:` block
- `Any Egawa graph with parameters (0, s)` -> `The Egawa graph with parameters (0, s)`
- You may add the reference of Agawa paper in file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` instead of putting link `https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(81)90007-8`. At least, use <code>:doi:\`10.1016/0097-3165(81)90007-8\`</code>
- you don't need to import `DenseGraph`. not used
- since `Y` is a graph, instead of the loop `for el in Y:`, you can do a loop like `for el in Y.neighbor_iterator(v[i]):`. Then, you can directly construct `u`.
- same for the loop `for el in X:`
- `for j in range(s): ` -> `for i in range(p, p+s):`
- I'm not sure it is really useful to use set `used`.
- add test to check that input parameters are ok

A few suggestions for `HammingGraph`:
- add an `INPUT:` block
- add test to check that input parameters are ok
- you don't need to import `DenseGraph`. not used
- instead of having both `q` and `X`, you could have a single parameter `q` that could be either an integer, in which case you have `X = list(range(q))` or an iterable container (list, set, tuple, etc.) in which case you can do `X = list(q)`.
- you could add a link to the wikipedia page
- I don't think you need the set `used`. You can add several times the same edge.

In the documentation of all methods, since you use `r""" some text """`, you can write latex equations. For instance, instead of writing <code>\`p\` != 0</code>, write <code>\`p \neq 0\`</code>. Write also <code>\`X^n\`</code> to get nicer html rendering.

I've set up my editor to only use spaces, it's so weird a few slipped through.\\

I've made the changes you suggested, save for the one about the parameters X and q. I see what you mean when you say one could use only one paramers, but I feel like it would be confusing to be able to pass either an integer or an iterable under the same name, and it's not like X needs to be passed most of the time anyway.\\
I'll add a check for the input soon too, but first I want to decide if there is a need to have this .pyx file for generators who need more speed.\\

There is some improvement mind you, but it's less than 10%. What should I do? Both versions are included in this commit, so that anyone can check for themselves what I mean, I'll simply delete the not needed ones when a decision has been made.

As I already said, I don't see the need for a pyx file if the code is essentially Python. Nonetheless, I will not fight against it.

You use type `bool`, but you could use `bint` instead (no need for import) as done in file `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph_pyx.pyx`.
You also import `string` but it is never used. You use type `str`.

Please format documentation in 80 columns mode.

In method `FurerGadget`:
- add an examples block
- I assume that `k` must be positive. What if `k==0` ? add a test.
- what is the expected type of `prefix` ? you could document that.
- you use `zip(...)`. With Python3, `zip` becomes an iterator. So if `Va = zip(...)`, you can iterate over `Va` only once. More precisely, after doing `G.add_vertices(Va)`, the operation `Va[i]` raises an error (in Python3). The solution here is to do `Va = list(zip(...))`.
- `rep(prefix, len(V_a))` -> `rep(prefix, k)`, no ?
- `for r in range(k+1) if r % 2 == 0` could be simply `for r in range(0, k+1, 2)`


In method `CaiFurerImmermanGraph`:
- in the documentation, you can write <code>\`G\`</code> instead of <code>\`\`G\`\`</code> to use latex.
- `F(v)` -> <code>\`F(v)\`</code>
- add an examples block and possibly some tests.
- What if `G` is the empty graph ?
- `G.edges(labels=False)` -> `G.edge_iterator(labels=False)`
- The block `temp = edge_ua` is currently not correct as it sets `edge_ua` to it's initial value without touching `edge_ub`. I recommend to rewrite it in 1 line: `edge_ua, edge_ub = edge_ub, edge_ua`.

In method `EgawaGraph`:
- Returns -> Return
- add tests on `p` and `s`. Strictly positive ? 


In `HammingGraph`:
- `if None (or left unused)` -> <code>if \`\`None\`\` (or left unused)</code>. It's a general convention in documentation for `None`, `True` and `False`.
- add tests for the expected values of `n` and `q`.

Sorry to bother you with all these "details", but the cleaner the code, the easier it is to maintain.

Fixed everything, the graph G can be empty for a CaiFurerImmerman graph, it will simply return an equally empty graph.
Prefix can be anything, so it doesn't really matter.
And anyway, don't worry about it, I appreciate the attention to details, you're telling me things I couldn't have known by myself, thanks.

I have to say in this case I agree with you, there's not much use for it, as the bottleneck in basically any case is going to be the creation of the graph itself, but since I didn't want to choose by myself, I'll leave it for other reviewers to decide. \\
It's a 1 minute job to delete one of the two versions, anyway.
