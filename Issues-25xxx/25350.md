<a id='comment:1'></a>Similar to #25349, more debatable since trivial operations with flint polynomials are reasonably fast, but, in my use cases at least, handling these special cases without creating temporary objects is faster.

<a id='comment:2'></a>So by my understanding, this test is now stronger than before:

```diff
-            if right in ZZ:
-                sig_on()
-                fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
-                        (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
-                sig_off()
-                return res
-        if self._parent is not right.parent():
-            right = self._parent(right)
-        sig_on()
-        fmpz_poly_div(res.__poly, self.__poly,
-                (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>right).__poly)
-        sig_off()
-        return res
+            if isinstance(right, Integer):
+                if (<Integer> right).is_zero():
+                    raise ZeroDivisionError("division by zero")
+                else:
+                    res = self._new()
+                    sig_on()
+                    fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
+                            (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
+                    sig_off()
+                    return res
+            else:
+                right = self._parent(right)
```
Hence, you get a slowdown:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: %timeit (x^2 + 13*x + 169) // QQ(13)
The slowest run took 86.24 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.97 µs per loop
```
vs 8.3.beta0:

```
sage: %timeit (x^2 + 13*x + 169) // QQ(13)
The slowest run took 174.81 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.06 µs per loop
```
The reason is it converts `QQ -> ZZ['x']` and then does the `floordiv`. This is likely common because if you do, e.g., `4/2` instead of `4//2`, you get something in `QQ`. Plus the extra `ZZ` conversion in your new test is unnecessary. I would instead do:

```python
            if isinstance(right, Integer):
                if (<Integer> right).is_zero():
                    raise ZeroDivisionError("division by zero")
                else:
                    res = self._new()
                    sig_on()
                    fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
                            (<Integer> right).value)
                    sig_off()
                    return res
            elif right in ZZ:
                res = self._new()
                sig_on()
                fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_mpz(res.__poly, self.__poly,
                        (<Integer>ZZ(right)).value)
                sig_off()
                return res
            else:
                right = self._parent(right)
```

Indeed. It was intentional (not the Right Way ⇒ no point in making it fast)... but I didn't think of that:

> This is likely common because if you do, e.g., `4/2` instead of `4//2`, you get something in `QQ`.


and I'm open to reverting the change.

That was an oversight, thanks!
