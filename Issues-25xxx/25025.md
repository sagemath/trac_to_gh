This does two things:
1) Original motivation is to ensure a Windows native path is used when passing the path to `Jmol.jar` to the java interpreter.

2) Cleans things up a bit by providing our own, slightly simpler `jmol` script as opposed to the script that comes with the jmol binary package, rather than patching that script.
