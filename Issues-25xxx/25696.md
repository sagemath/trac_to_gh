I'm not sure we have the right/common definition of cliques here.  Docs say:

  A clique is a set of vertices such that there is an edge between any two vertices.


I would say:

  A clique is a set of vertices such that there is a **single** edge between any two vertices.

For example, according to this paper [here](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0012365X07004736/1-s2.0-S0012365X07004736-main.pdf?_tid=14011a02-1462-4f2e-bd26-ae008042d602&acdnat=1530371745_b4554aaf02a9a601a6ab55e63afe7571),

  A clique in a graph or multigraph G is a simple complete subgraph of G.

Also the indentation in `INPUT` section for parameters `vertices` and `directed_clique` is wrong (but right for `induced` and `loops`).

Good catch ! This is a side effect of `g.subgraph(vertices)` that don't check if `vertices` is a subset of the vertices of the graph. I added a simple test.

Do you think I should open a ticket to raise an error in `g.subgraph(vertices)` when some vertices (or edges) are not in the graph ?

To me it sounds logical. I expect that

```
SymmetricGroup(2).subgroup((1,2), 'junk')
Poset({1: [2]}).subposet([1, 'junk'])
Graph({1:[2]}).subgraph([1, 'junk'])
```

gives similar output (they do not), and actually I have changed the output of

```
Poset({1: [2], 3: []}).is_antichain_of_poset([1,2,4])
```

to be an error message, not `False`.

However, if you do that, then this ticket should be postponed until that is ready.

I prefer to have this ticket fixed now since it impacts other methods. For instance, `g.vertex_connectivity()` has special treatment for cliques. If `g.is_clique()` returns a wrong answer, then the answer of `g.vertex_connectivity()` is also wrong.

We can deal with the `subgraph` problem independently.
