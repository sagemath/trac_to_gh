The current implementation of `gen_legendre_P` is not accurate. No distinction between Ferrers functions and Legendre functions has been made and some special cases are not correctly implemented. This heavily affects spherical harmonics. For a quick fix, to make spherical harmonics work, I propose to temporarily restrict `gen_legendre_P` to Ferrers functions. In a follow-up #31637, we will make the distinction complete.

**Old Description**

I am using the `gen_legendre_P` function (an instance of `Func_assoc_legendre_P`
from `sage/functions/orthogonal_polys.py`) to evaluate associated Legendre
functions / Ferrers functions in SageMath 8.1.

There appears to be a discrepancy in the results I obtain, depending on whether
I use `gen_legendre_P.eval_poly()` or directly call `gen_legendre_P()` in some cases.
I think this is because the `_eval_` method first tries to call the `_eval_special_values_`
method, before using `eval_poly`.

With this input

```
x = SR.var('x')
print(gen_legendre_P.eval_poly(1, 1, x))
print(gen_legendre_P(1, 1, x))
print(gen_legendre_P.eval_poly(1, 1, 0.5))
print(gen_legendre_P(1, 1, 0.5))
```

I obtain

```
-sqrt(-x^2 + 1)
sqrt(x^2 - 1)
-0.866025403784439
5.30287619362453e-17 + 0.866025403784439*I
```

The result from eval_poly agrees with Mathematica, i.e.

```
LegendreP[1, 1, 0.5]
-0.866025
```

Based on the above output, it seems to me that `gen_legendre_P.eval_poly(1, 1, cos(theta))` will always be real while `gen_legendre_P(1, 1, cos(theta))` will be complex (unless |cos(theta)| = 1), since cos(theta) is in the interval [-1,1].

Looking at the code for `Func_assoc_legendre_P._eval_special_values_`, I suspect the culprit is the `n == m` case, which returns

```
factorial(2*m)/2**m/factorial(m) * (x**2-1)**(m/2)
```

This discrepancy also seems to be present in `spherical_harmonic` when
`n == m` (an instance of `SphericalHarmonic` from `sage/functions/special.py`),
which is built using `gen_legendre_P`.

After [discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/IDtiGF6HB28/ErLsqI1eBAAJ)
in the sage-devel mailing list it appears that this is because the `n == m`
case in `_eval_special_values_` is based on  https://dlmf.nist.gov/14.7#E15,
but this is not defined in (-infinity,1].

For the spherical harmonics, where the argument x = cos(theta),
x will always be in the range [-1, 1 ], where special case used
in `_eval_special_values_` is not defined.

On the sage-devel mailing list, Howard Cohl suggested that
the correct formula for x in [-1, 1] is 

```
P_m^m(x)=(-1)^m (2m)!/(2^m m!) (1-x^2)^(m/2)
```

See: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/IDtiGF6HB28/QWwnAeLJBAAJ

According to Howard Cohl this is formally a Ferrers function
(defined on (-1,1) ), rather than an associated Legendre polynomial.
However, the existing code for Func_assoc_legendre_P does not
seem to make any distinction between Ferrers and associated
Legendre functions. 

My proposed fix would be to have `Func_assoc_legendre_P._eval_special_values_` choose between two `n == m` special cases, based on whether `-1 <= x <= 1` (above expression) or `> 1` (current expression).

This raises the question of whether `Func_assoc_legendre_P` is correctly defined, as at present it would seem to cover both Ferrers functions and associated Legendre functions. 

In my experience with the physics/chemistry literature, the spherical harmonics are universally defined in terms of "associated Legendre functions", even though the argument is x = cos(theta). DLMF suggests these are defined in terms of Ferrers functions of the first kind (https://dlmf.nist.gov/14.30.E1). Wolfram Mathematica does not seem to distinguish. Possibly it is worth flagging in the docstring for `Func_assoc_legendre_P` that the class seems to cover both functions.

I have uploaded a proposal. Please let me know in case I have missed any details.

**What have I done?**

- The main modification is as proposed:

   ```diff
            if m == 0:
                return legendre_P(n, x)
            if n == m:
   -            return (-1)**m*(1-x**2)**(m/2) * ZZ(2*m-1).multifactorial(2)
   +            return (-1)**m*factorial(2*m)/(2**m*factorial(m)) * (1-x**2)**(m/2)
   ```

- Furthermore I have added the feature of negative `m` which wasn't there yet.
- The special case `m+1=n` has been added.

You are invited to contribute more doctests, especially for spherical harmonics. So far, I have only collected some of the code snippets posted above that have not worked. They are working now.

**Follow-Ups**

- As for resolving convention conflicts, I propose to wrap this up in a follow-up ticket (#31637).

- Moreover, imho the documentation for orthogonal polynomials is a mess and urgently needs to be cleaned up. I suggest to attack this in another follow-up ticket (#31636).

<div id="comment:23" align="right">comment:23</div>

The order in which you perform tests is important. Here:

```
if n in ZZ and m in ZZ and (x in ZZ or not SR(x).is_numeric()) and n >= 0:
```
you should have the `n >= 0` before the `x` tests as it is quicker.

I am also not sure about doing the multiplication first in the quotient here:

```
return (-1)**m*factorial(2*m)/(2**m*factorial(m)) * (1-x**2)**(m/2)
```
I feel like 

```
(-1)**m * factorial(2*m)/factorial(m)/2**m * (1-x**2)**(m/2)
```
should give better performance since we know the first division is exact. (I really would prefer `//`, but that won't work if `m` is a symbolic variable unfortunately...)

Also, a while-we-are-at-it:

```diff
-return ZZ(0)
+return ZZ.zero()
```

I probably would also be good to add support for negative `n` by replacing it with `-n-1`. This will get rid of the error for `gen_legendre_P(-2,-2,x)`.

I don't understand why you feed this back through the full evaluation instead of this:

```diff
-return x*(2*m+1)*gen_legendre_P(m, m, x)
+return x * (2*m+1) * self._eval_special_values_(m, m, x)
```

A small tweak in the language:

```diff
-Print the first associated Legendre polynomials::
+We give the first associated Legendre polynomials::
```
I would also add a space around the `=` to make it easier to read the output.

Please put the `REFERENCES:` at the end of the docstring (and add the `S`).

I thought the previous version was fine. I don't like forcing it all together, as opposed to what many other functions do. I also don't really think the `SR(x).is_numeric()` test being run so frequently is good.

Additionally, with your current code, if passing symbolic `m == n`, it no longer gets the special value AFAICS.

True. However, this particular formula holds indeed if `m` and `n` are integers. But I am not sure whether this extends accordingly to arbitrary `m` and `n` using Gamma functions...

Playing around with the numeric tool, it turned out that the case `abs(m) > n` only yields zero for the integer case (try for example `gen_legendre_P(2.,3.*I,.5)`).

Grouping it the same way as before would therefore lead to many redundant if-statements, as said above. I don't think this is desirable either.

I think this is a lot better.

This is a bit cumbersome way of saying "let m be a positive integer":

```
+    For `n` being a non-negative integer, negative integer values for `m`
+    with `|m| \leq n` can be obtained by:
+
+    .. MATH::
+
+            P^{-|m|}_n(x) = (-1)^{|m|} \frac{(n-|m|)!}{(n+|m|)!} P_n^{|m|}(x).
```

I am not sure about removing the `_eval_special_values_` from `_evalf_`. Can we add doctests for floating point input with special values?

I think we should also add doctests to `_eval_special_values_` for symbolic `m` input as well.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A35):
> I am not sure about removing the `_eval_special_values_` from `_evalf_`. Can we add doctests for floating point input with special values?

I think it is reasonable to assume that `mpmath` already uses optimized algorithms, isn't it? Moreover, without the above patch we have something like that:

```
sage: %%time 
....: gen_legendre_P(1.2,1.1,0)
CPU times: user 2.78 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.78 ms
Wall time: 2.8 ms
2.14354692507259*cos(1.15000000000000*pi)*gamma(33/20)/(sqrt(pi)*gamma(749113601384401/713441525128001))
```

which already looks clunky. Moreover if we want the answer in terms of floating numbers, we get:

```
sage: %%time 
....: gen_legendre_P(1.2,1.1,0).n()
CPU times: user 166 ms, sys: 7.01 ms, total: 173 ms
Wall time: 204 ms
-0.996322549249593
```

whereas compared to with patch:

```
sage: %%time 
....: gen_legendre_P(1.2,1.1,0)
CPU times: user 302 µs, sys: 20 µs, total: 322 µs
Wall time: 326 µs
-0.996322549249593
```

For the case `m=n` however, the `mpmath` version seems to be slightly slower than evaluating the special case (now everything with the new patch):

```
sage: %%time 
....: gen_legendre_P._evalf_(1,1,.2)
CPU times: user 1.29 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.29 ms
Wall time: 1.29 ms
-0.979795897113271
sage: %%time 
....: gen_legendre_P._eval_special_values_(1,1,.2)
CPU times: user 124 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 124 µs
Wall time: 127 µs
-0.979795897113271
```

But treading these cases differently would dismantle `_eval_special_values_` again.

> 
> I think we should also add doctests to `_eval_special_values_` for symbolic `m` input as well.

I'll do.

You have renamed the public function `eval_poly`, so this need a `deprecated_function_alias`.

As per [comment:39](#comment%3A39), I consider this to be a regression because you removed `_eval_special_values_` from `_evalf_`:

```
sage: gen_legendre_P(x,x,.2)                                                                              
gen_legendre_P(x, x, 0.200000000000000)

versus before:

```
(-0.960000000000000)^(1/2*x)*factorial(2*x)/(2^x*factorial(x))

This has nothing to do with removing `_eval_special_values_`. In fact:

```
sage: assume(x, 'integer')                                                      
sage: gen_legendre_P(x, x, .2)                                                  
0.960000000000000^(1/2*x)*(-1)^x*factorial(2*x)/(2^x*factorial(x))
```

It is the line

```diff
+        if m.is_integer() and n.is_integer():
             ...
             if m == n:
```
that makes sure that this formula is only used when `x` is an integer.

Okay, thanks for the explanation. This will be good. Just a few more minor things:

- `Case `|m| > |n|` for integers:` needs a `::`
- Add a period at the end of the `.. MATH::` in `eval_gen_poly`.
- Some formatting: <code>Evaluate the Ferrers function \`P(n, m, x)\` for \`m\` and \`n\` being concrete</code>
- I would move the paragraph <code>These expressions ... \`where |m| \leq |n|\`.</code> to the main part of the documentation so it is more visible.

Only the first is a must-do, but the rest are good while-we-are-at-it things.

Once these are done, it will be a positive review from me.

I agree. However, the documentation of the whole file needs to be refactored imo (see #31636). Thus, I'll leave it there for now.
