I would expect the result of the following six commands to be the same.

```
sage: ZqFM(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[]
sage: ZqCA(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[]
sage: ZqFP(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[]
sage: QqFP(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[]
sage: ZqCR(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[0]
sage: QqCR(4,names='a')(0).polynomial().list()
[0]
```
However, they are not. The ones where the precision model is capped-relative gives [0] instead of the expected [].
