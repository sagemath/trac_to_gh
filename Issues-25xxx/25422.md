This is about two times faster than current implementation (assuming #25420 done). I tested with both `posets.BooleanLattice(9)` and with list of all posets on 7 elements.

Could be made better still.

Depends on #25420

The code change you suggest is for `ordinal_summands`, which you already give positive review in #25420.

The change is an easy one, but are these changes to ticket already reviewed those that Volker does not like?

It would be better to do it here in case #25420 is already merged in to Volker's branch.

Sorry I didn't realize the readability thing on #25420.
