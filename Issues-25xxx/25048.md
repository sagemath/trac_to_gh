Error installing package tachyon-0.98.9.p7
************************************************************************
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the log file
  /Users/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/logs/pkgs/tachyon-0.98.9.p7.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/Users/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/tmp/sage/build/tachyon-0.98.9.p7 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '/Users/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/tmp/sage/build/tachyon-0.98.9.p7' && '/Users/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/sage' --sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
