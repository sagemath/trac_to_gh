Is `Family` even supposed to be a `dict` subclass?  If not, then I would leave it.  There's nothing wrong with some class having a method called `has_key`, but if it's a `dict` subclass then it is confusing to still have it.

I would update the deprecation message slightly--"use in instead" is very confusing if you don't know what the `in` keyword is--the message almost looks like a typo.  Instead it should say something like <code>use \`key in dictionary\` syntax instead</code>

No, it is not a subclass of `dict`, only of `Parent` and behaves somewhat like an immutable `dict`.
