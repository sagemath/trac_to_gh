Add a generator of random regular bipartite graph, `RandomRegularBipartite`.

This ticket also unifies the graph embedding method of `CompleteBipartiteGraph`, `RandomRegularBipartite` and `RandomBipartite` by using method `_line_embedding` from `graph_plot.py`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello, this is my first attempt to review a patch... feel free to let me know if any of these suggestions are inappropriate or out of scope!

First, am I correct that `RandomRegularBipartite` does not sample uniformly from the set of random regular bipartite graphs with the given sizes and degrees? If this is the case, then the documentation for this function should make it more clear what the sampled distribution is. 

Second, would you mind adding documentation (and possibly tests) for the position dictionaries generated by `RandomBipartite` and `RandomRegularBipartite`?

I also noticed that the only other random graph generator which assigns positions is `RandomTriangulation` and it only does so if the parameter `set_position` is explicitly set to `True`. Should these two functions thus also be given a `set_position` parameter for consistency?

Finally, the name given to the graph generated by `RandomRegularBipartite` could be made more informative, perhaps something like:

```python
name="Random regular bipartite graph of size {}+{} with degrees {} and {}".format(n1, n2, d1, d2)
```

+Add a generator of random regular bipartite graph, `RandomRegularBipartite`.
 
+This ticket also unifies the graph embedding method of `CompleteBipartiteGraph`, `RandomRegularBipartite` and `RandomBipartite` by using method `_line_embedding` from `graph_plot.py`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>I have chosen not to create a new method in `graph_plot.py` as the need for bipartite embedding is rather limited so far. I use 2 calls to `_line_embedding` instead.

I have corrected the method for `_line_embedding` to avoid errors with graphs on 0 or 1 vertex.
