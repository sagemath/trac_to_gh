Currently the python3 syntax tests needs write access to the source directory because it attempts to create `pyc` files in it.

This new implementation of the test instead writes those `pyc` files in a temporary directory. It does pretty much the same as the main function of `py_compile` except that it gives a target file argument (without that the default is in the same directory).

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A3):
> 1. Since we don't need the output file anyway, is it possible to compile to `sys.devnull` instead?


Unfortunately not:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 7, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/py_compile.py", line 120, in compile
    raise FileExistsError(msg.format(cfile))
FileExistsError: /dev/null is a non-regular file and will be changed into a regular one if import writes a byte-compiled file to it

```

> 2. Passing the filenames as actual arguments seems safer than embedding the filenames as strings in the script. So I would pass those filenames as before and then use `sys.argv` in the script.


Right, changed.

OK, instead of writing the output to a temporary file, you could just compile in memory using this code from `py_compile.compile`:

```
    loader = importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader('<py_compile>', file)
    source_bytes = loader.get_data(file)
    code = loader.source_to_code(source_bytes, file,
                                 _optimize=optimize)
