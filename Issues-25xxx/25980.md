Developers currently don't have an easy way to test proposed changes on OSX & Windows if they do not have access to such machines themselves. Given the flakiness of the patchbot on Windows, it would be nice to provision GitLab CI infrastructure for these systems.

We can not use the docker setup unfortunately, as docker on Windows is not ready to run fork-heavy workloads (#25805) and docker on OSX does simply not exist.

The current idea would be to provide SSH runners on Linux machines tagged as `osx` & `nt` that run QEMU/KVM. An incoming CI request would then take an LVM snapshot of an existing Windows/OSX machine, start a QEMU/KVM machine on it, and run its CI via SSH.

CI on the "develop" branch would probably start from a clean OS snapshot and [tag](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Cluster_Logical_Volume_Manager/lvm_tags.html) the resulting LVM volume to "develop" so the build artifacts can be reused by runs on other branches.

GitLab does not support libvirt officially but there is this [runner](https://gitlab.com/0xQSL/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/dev-libvirt-runner-v1/executors/libvirt/executor_libvirt.go) that seems quite reasonable as a starting point.

# Performance
## OSX
Sage builds from scratch on QEMU on a dual core with 2GB RAM and a seeded ccache in 160 minutes. With `local/` intact from a previous build it rebuilds in seconds.

## Windows
Sage builds from scratch on QEMU on a single core with 1.5GB RAM and a seeded ccache in about 500 minutes.

```
real    472m37.961s
user    284m29.903s
sys     180m23.735s
```
With `local/` intact from a previous build it rebuilds in seconds.

# Legalities
## OSX
Relevant seems to be 2.B of their [license](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOS1013.pdf) in particular
> to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software 
> within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is 
> already running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing during 
> software development; (c) using macOS Server; or (d) personal, non-commercial use.

Now, the "already running" bit is weird because that means that we cannot use Linux as the base system?

This bit is the same for all the languages that I can read except for the German one which surprisingly omits the "already running":
> Zum Installieren, Nutzen und Ausführen von bis zu zwei (2) zusätzlichen Kopien oder 
> Exemplaren der Apple-Software innerhalb virtueller Betriebssystemumgebungen auf jedem Mac-
> Computer, dessen Eigentümer du bist oder der deiner Kontrolle unterliegt, zum Zwecke der: (a) 
> Softwareentwicklung; (b) Durchführung von Tests während der Softwareentwicklung; (c) Nutzung 
> von macOS Server; oder (d) der persönlichen, nicht kommerziellen Nutzung.


So, it's Ok to run two instances of OSX virtualized on Apple Hardware. I could imagine that it would be Ok to run more than two if we used different versions of OSX and therefore got separate licenses but I am not an expert here.

## Windows
Can we use the trial versions of Win10 for testing purposes? I guess not, but we should check.

<a id='comment:10'></a>FWIW from my recent build from scratch for the 8.3 release (this is likely with some ccache seeding but probably not for everything):

```
real    332m31.190s
user    515m41.689s
sys 249m16.470s
```

This is with `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=8`.

This is a bug I've seen sometimes but am not sure how to reproduce, where in fact there are still other packages building in the background, but `make` doesn't switch which job it's following to print to stdout so it looks like it's hanging, while in fact other jobs are still running.

There are a number of tests--the ones you reported as failed being some of the common ones (such as `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`) that are slow and fail often due to timeout.  Re-running them, or increasing the timeout, usually fixes it.
