OK, the problem is that the algorithm has been changed so that only a part of a row was rescaled. That's quite reasonable to do, and actually one of the changes of SharedMeatAxe compared to MeatAxe is that in the school book gaußian elimination implementation I made it so that the already annulated part of a row is not rescaled.

Only in the wrapper in Sage I did not expose that functionality. I guess that needs to change.

Ah, I found the problem: the method was renamed `_echelon_in_place_classical` -> `_echelon_in_place`. So the generic matrix code is no longer calling the specialized version.

Okay, so this fixes the problem. It has a bit of technical debt as it pushes a potentially bigger issue design issue down the road, but it works. I also do similar fixes for other matrices that may not be using their optimized code. A bigger design discussion on matrices is likely needed.

The patchbot complains that there is a non-ascii character. But I cannot identify it. So, what is it?

The patchbot complains about pyflakes. But the error is "NameError: name 'isPythonFile' is not defined". Doesn't that mean there is a bug in the plugin, not in the changeset?

The patchbot complains about startup time. I don't know how to interpret the numbers, so I don't know how much of a problem we have here.

The test error is reproducible as follows:

```
sage: K.<x> = GF(25)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K,9,3,implementation='generic')()
sage: entries = [((0, 2), x), ((0, 4), 3*x + 2), ((0, 8), 2*x), ((1, 1), x + 3), ((1, 5), 3*x), ((1, 6), x + 4), ((2, 0), 2*x), ((2, 5), 4*x + 1)]
sage: for (i,j),v in entries: M[j,i]=v
sage: M
[      0       0     2*x]
[      0   x + 3       0]
[      x       0       0]
[      0       0       0]
[3*x + 2       0       0]
[      0     3*x 4*x + 1]
[      0   x + 4       0]
[      0       0       0]
[    2*x       0       0]
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
sage: M._echelon_in_place('classical')
(0, 1, 2)
```
Hence, `M._echelon_in_place_classical` behaves differently for Matrix_gfpn_dense and for generic implementation. That indeed needs to be fixed.
