The patch can be replaced by a doctest warning filter. That means that sage doesn't have to maintain that patch anymore and distributions don't have to patch that package just for sage.

This patch originated at [debian](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/master/debian/patches/u2-pari-stackwarn.patch) and I adapted it for [the nix package](https://github.com/timokau/nixpkgs/blob/sage-on-nixos/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/pari-stackwarn.patch).

For the record: it has been declined multiple times upstream but I eventually managed to convince one PARI developer to accept this patch. Even then, a different PARI developer reverted patch of my patch (the commit you linked to is actually that revert).
