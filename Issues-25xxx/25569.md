```
sage: q = TorsionQuadraticForm(matrix.identity(30)/5)
sage: %timeit q.submodule(q.some_elements())
1 loop, best of 3: 514 ms per loop
sage: fgp = q.V()/q.W()
sage: %timeit fgp.submodule(fgp.some_elements())
10 loops, best of 3: 27.6 ms per loop
```
The reason for this dramatic difference is that the 
Constructor for `TorsionQuadraticModules` tries to figues out the modulus of the quadratic form. Thus it has to compute tons of inner products.

<a id='comment:1'></a>With sage 8.3.beta5

```
sage: q = TorsionQuadraticForm(matrix.identity(30)/5)
sage: %timeit q.submodule(q.some_elements())
1 loop, best of 3: 474 ms per loop
```
with the ticket

```
sage: q = TorsionQuadraticForm(matrix.identity(30)/5)
sage: %timeit q.submodule(q.some_elements())
10 loops, best of 3: 63.7 ms per loop
```
Unfortunately we are still 3 times slower than fgp_modules -- not sure where that is coming from

```
sage: q = q.V()/q.W()
sage: %timeit q.submodule(q.some_elements())
10 loops, best of 3: 26.5 ms per loop
