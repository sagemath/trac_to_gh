Please implement 

-the Q basis, as in Bergeron-Zabrocki ​https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509265 start of section 6

-the Phi basis, as in Novelli-Thibon ​https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605061 lines 55-56

Define an order on ordered-set-partitions: u<v if v can be obtained by merging adjacent parts of u, where all numbers in the left part are smaller than all numbers in the right part.

Q_u is the sum of M_w over all w>u;
Phi_v is the sum of M_w over all w<v.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Actually the product and coproduct on the Phi basis are quite easy to understand. But they are in terms of segmented permutations - i.e. think of the ordered set partition as a word/permutation with some bars. Because we need ideas like shuffle and deconcatenate.

* Product = sum of shifted shuffles - i.e. compute the shifted shuffle as words, then there is a bar between letters a and b if either a,b came from the same word and there was a bar in between, or if b comes from the first word and a from the second.
* Coproduct = deconcatenate and standardise. The deconcatenation can be within a block or between blocks.

My best idea for how to do this:

* we already have ordered-set-partition -> composition.
* make a function: ordered-set-partition -> permutation, that writes each block in increasing order and concatenates the blocks in the original order.
* make an "inverse" for these combined: i.e. given a permutation and a composition, make an ordered-set-partition whose blocks have sizes given by the composition, and the first block is the first few letters of the permutation, the second block is the next few letters, and so on.

Then we can compute shuffle and deconcatenation in the permutation/composition format.

If you think it is useful, I can try to code the functions osp->permutation and (permutation,composition)->osp . But it will be of the level at #25152. Not sure if that's too rudimentary to be useful.

Sorry not to be of much help. Thanks Darij for all the coding so far.
