Looks good. I think you want to drop an "s" and replace `"Test whether count and integrate are functionals."` with
<code>"Test whether \`\`count\`\` and \`\`integrate\`\` are functional."</code> Also, I think that our new files should have copyright headers at least that's what the developer guide suggests.

The patchbot run looks weird. Do you understand what's going on?
