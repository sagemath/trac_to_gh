<a id='comment:13'></a>There's something about this ticket which seems to make patchbots crash. Whenever my patchbot (fermat) gets around to testing this ticket, it gets as far as applying the patch + building docs, and then it hangs -- the python subprocesses that are spawned to build the various ref manual chapters somehow get stuck + don't terminate.

Any idea what could be causing this? No other currently-open ticket causes this behaviour.
