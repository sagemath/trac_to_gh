Looks good. I think you want to drop an "s" and replace `"Test whether count and integrate are functionals."` with
<code>"Test whether \`\`count\`\` and \`\`integrate\`\` are functional."</code> Also, I think that our new files should have copyright headers at least that's what the developer guide suggests.

The patchbot run looks weird. Do you understand what's going on?

There's something about this ticket which seems to make patchbots crash. Whenever my patchbot (fermat) gets around to testing this ticket, it gets as far as applying the patch + building docs, and then it hangs -- the python subprocesses that are spawned to build the various ref manual chapters somehow get stuck + don't terminate.

Any idea what could be causing this? No other currently-open ticket causes this behaviour.
