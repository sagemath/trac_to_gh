This branch is now ready for review!  George Seelinger has already reviewed this code (https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage/issues/6) and the code has been modified accordingly, so there shouldn't be much left to do.

One small question:

1. The sagedocs say I should use "this" terminology in my docstrings for methods.  For example, given a method `score` for the Partition object, the docstring would say something like "find the score of this partition" as opposed to "given a partition, find its score".  Should I go ahead and alter all of the language in my method docstrings accordingly?  (It's a lot of work, so I want to make sure it's necessary before I spend a lot of time doing it).

I am a very strong -1 to that (grr...they snuck that change in). Use <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> as that never causes any problems or ambiguity. Also, for methods, the first argument must be `self`.

However, your docstrings are mal-formatted. It should be:

```
def foo(self, bar):
    r"""
    One line description saying what the method does.

    Long description but keep each line at most 80 characters
    unless necessary. This is where you put the more conceptual
    information.
    """
```

You might find the `.. PLOT::` syntax useful. However, just use the `ascii_art` or `.pp()` for the diagrams of the partitions instead of pictures. That is sufficient, but I think is generally overkill for such small examples.

The `_is_sequence` is mostly useless and does not test what its name suggests (e.g., it does not handle `tuple`). It also is not used. Remove it.

Similarly for `is_*_decreasing`. Just inline them. The code makes it clear what is going on.

You are too verbose in your descriptions in, e.g., `boundary()` as you are just saying the same thing as the output. (That `TESTS::` block is mal-formatted as well.)

Error messages are not complete sentences, so not capitalized and no period at the end.

Typo: `THerefore`.

It is better to use `_Partitions(la)` than `Partition(la)` as there is less indirection.

I will likely have more comments once these things are fixed.

Thanks for the rapid reply!

I'm putting the 80 char docstrings thing on my to-do list.  I've made the requested change in my latest commit, with a few exceptions / need for further discussion.

`_is_sequence` is used in `root_ideal.py` and `all.py` (see https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage/search?q=_is_sequence&unscoped_q=_is_sequence).

The boundary explanation is admittedly confusing.  I can try to rewrite it.  What are you referring to as "the output"?

Is it a requirement that error messages are not sentences?  I could not find it in the conventions (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html).

```
        has boundary [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]::

            sage: Partition([1]).boundary()
            [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]

This is a Python convention, and we are trying to adhere to it. Sage is not uniform, but you should not make the situation worse.

When you say "useless by itself", do you mean useless to end users?  Certainly, it is not uncommon to have code that is not meant to be used by end users.  These are components which help other parts of the code to run.  Many languages designate pieces of code as "private" or "protected" for this reason.

The benefit of a utility function like this one is eliminating redundancy.  This makes code shorter.

In addition, it helps keep behavior/usage consistent across many end-user functions.

The benefit of *not* having such a function is that other functions become more self-contained, which makes it easier for somebody to alter one of those functions in the future.

I originally did not put a reviewer name because I didn't know whether I should put George, Travis, or someone else.  After some thought and discussion, George has agreed to be the reviewer.  I think George is the most appropriate choice for a few reasons.

```json
{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:27\" align=\"right\">comment:27</div>\n\na) I am going to recommend removing all papers not currently being referenced in the added documentation. These are currently BMPS2018b, Fuchs1994, Fun2012, HS1968, LN2014. If future tickets need them, they can be added in at that time.\n\nb) Documentation for `k_size` is redundant: the NOTE and the second sentence are the same. \n\nc) The TESTS block of `boundary` does not adhere to Sage conventions.\n\nd) For the second sentence of the `boundary` documentation, I think it might be good to specify French convention when mentioning the northeasternmost point. Maybe for clarity, a description for both French and English conventions should be provided (so southeasternmost point in English convention), especially considering English convention is the default for Sage, although French is used in the cited paper for `k_boundary`. \n\ne) I think `has_rectangle` should have an INPUT block in its documentation to specify these inputs are supposed to be integers. Also, I suggest implementation to the effect of `return self.to_exp(w)[w] >= h` since the `.to_exp()` function already does the counting of row lengths. \n\nf) Rephrase first sentence of `has_rectangle` and `has_k_rectangle` to meet Sage standards: \"Return True if ...\"\n\ng) `has_k_rectangle` EXAMPLES are not obviously `has_k_rectangle` tests. They should be commented with `# indirect doctest` and maybe there should be one example that highlights the difference between this method and `is_k_reducible` (if it `is_k_reducible` is kept; see item l below). \n\nh) `is_k_bounded` docstring should begin \"Return `True`\" instead of \"Returns `True`\"\n\ni) Nitpicking on `is_k_bounded`, partitions are ordered such that the first entry is the largest. So, I would recommend something like \n\n```\nif self.is_empty():\n    return True\nelse:\n    return self[0] <= k\n```\n\nj) Documentation of `is_k_reducible`, `is_k_irreducible`, `has_rectangle`, `has_k_rectangle` should all say \"its Ferrer's diagram\" not \"it's Ferrer's diagram\"\n\nk) I think the assertion statement of `is_k_reducible` should include the comment above in the error message.\n\nl) This is item is just my opinion: it is a little unnecessary to include both `is_k_reducible` and `is_k_irreducible` since they are just logical opposites of each other and it adds many lines of redundant documentation (thus extra documentation to maintain). I am not sure whether Sage has a convention about such things or not; indeed, the `Permutations` class has both an `is_reducible` and `is_irreducible` method, but polynomials only have an `is_irreducible` method.

<div id="comment:27" align="right">comment:27</div>

a) I am going to recommend removing all papers not currently being referenced in the added documentation. These are currently BMPS2018b, Fuchs1994, Fun2012, HS1968, LN2014. If future tickets need them, they can be added in at that time.

b) Documentation for `k_size` is redundant: the NOTE and the second sentence are the same. 

c) The TESTS block of `boundary` does not adhere to Sage conventions.

d) For the second sentence of the `boundary` documentation, I think it might be good to specify French convention when mentioning the northeasternmost point. Maybe for clarity, a description for both French and English conventions should be provided (so southeasternmost point in English convention), especially considering English convention is the default for Sage, although French is used in the cited paper for `k_boundary`. 

e) I think `has_rectangle` should have an INPUT block in its documentation to specify these inputs are supposed to be integers. Also, I suggest implementation to the effect of `return self.to_exp(w)[w] >= h` since the `.to_exp()` function already does the counting of row lengths. 

f) Rephrase first sentence of `has_rectangle` and `has_k_rectangle` to meet Sage standards: "Return True if ..."

g) `has_k_rectangle` EXAMPLES are not obviously `has_k_rectangle` tests. They should be commented with `# indirect doctest` and maybe there should be one example that highlights the difference between this method and `is_k_reducible` (if it `is_k_reducible` is kept; see item l below). 

h) `is_k_bounded` docstring should begin "Return `True`" instead of "Returns `True`"

i) Nitpicking on `is_k_bounded`, partitions are ordered such that the first entry is the largest. So, I would recommend something like 

```
if self.is_empty():
    return True
else:
    return self[0] <= k
```

j) Documentation of `is_k_reducible`, `is_k_irreducible`, `has_rectangle`, `has_k_rectangle` should all say "its Ferrer's diagram" not "it's Ferrer's diagram"

k) I think the assertion statement of `is_k_reducible` should include the comment above in the error message.

l) This is item is just my opinion: it is a little unnecessary to include both `is_k_reducible` and `is_k_irreducible` since they are just logical opposites of each other and it adds many lines of redundant documentation (thus extra documentation to maintain). I am not sure whether Sage has a convention about such things or not; indeed, the `Permutations` class has both an `is_reducible` and `is_irreducible` method, but polynomials only have an `is_irreducible` method. However, I would recommend sticking with just one method; personally, I prefer having `is_irreducible` methods, like in the polynomial case. Ultimately, I leave this decision up to you. 

m) With validating the inputs on `next_within_bounds`, I might prefer to take the "Garbage in Garbage out" approach and remove the assertions. In particular, I don't see why it would be a problem a priori if a user passed in a tuple, a composition that happens to also be a partition, a core, etc. Also, later in the code, `min` and `max` are casted to the appropriate types anyways, which I believe would serve as a good enough input validation.

n) On `next_within_bounds`, I feel like `type` is not a good argument name because it is a reserved word in Python. Maybe it should change to `partition_type` or something of the sort.

o) For `is_k_core`, there is already an `is_core(k)` method in the Partition class that does this, so I think `is_k_core` should probably be removed.

p) For `to_k_core`, I think there should be a more verbose name so as not to confuse with the `to_core(k)` method. Also, it is noted in the documentation how it will behave when given a `k-1` bounded partition, but I think it might be helpful to make it more explicit. In particular, if `part` is `k-1` bounded, `part.to_k_core(k)` should be the same as `Partition(part.to_core(k-1))`. So, it would also make sense to include <code>:meth:\`to_core\`</code> in a SEEALSO block. Furthermore, it should include a test that triggers the `ValueError`. An easy example is `Partition([3]).to_k_core(2)`. Finally, I am worried about some of the comments in this method; there are suggested improvements in the method that should just as well be programmed. If this will slow down finishing this ticket, maybe it would be easier to add this method in as a separate ticket. 

z) We should PEP 8 the docstrings before final acceptance!

a)
removed: BMPS2018b, Fun2012, LN2014.

did not remove: Fuchs1994, HS1968.  These two are part of the develop branch.  They appear in the diff because they caused a merge conflict.

b) removed NOTE

c) fixed

d) I have specified the French convention and provided a small example of the French convention.  (but i didn't see the need for talking about the english convention because it thought it would be too much)  Please read it and let me know if it is satisfactory or not.

Also, should perhaps cite the paper in boundary docstring too?

e1) INPUT block added.

e2) done

f) done

g) something was wrong here.  the examples were using is_k_reducible instead of has_k_rectangle.  i have changed them to has_k_rectangle.

h) done

i) Took your advice, but now added `assert k >= 0`

j) done

k) done

l) Definitely a hair splitter.  I will leave both.

m) okay, you do have a point.  done.

n) So is min and max.  I really broke all the rules on this one.  But I chose these keywords because they were clear, short, and convenient for the user.

changed type to partition_type (because i think its more clear)

o) Removed, but combined the docstrings since the other one had some issues.

I have :meth:`Core` in the docstring but i think it's a typo.  I'm pretty sure it should be :class:`Core`?

p) Also, a reference to the "well-known" bijection would be good.  Do you know of any (published) sources we can reference?

Do you think this method is redundant?

z) Wow, I can't believe we went through the whole alphabet.  I agree, but let's wait until after everything else is resolved.

o) In the docstring paragraph, <code>:meth:\`core\`</code> is used. In the SEEALSO block, it honestly makes sense to have *both* <code>:meth:\`core\`</code> and <code>:class:\`Core\`</code>.

Doctests are currently passing for me. 

However, documentation is not building because 

q) the path for `k-rim.JPG` is wrong. It should be `../../media/k-rim.JPG`. 

r) Also, the INPUT blocks were not quite "line broken" correctly.

s) I think describing ``self`` in the input block is unnecessary and not typically done in Sage conventions unless there is something out of the ordinary going on.

I have gone ahead and fixed these minor things myself. If you agree with the changes, you may set the ticket to "Positive Review".
