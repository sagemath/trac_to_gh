```
This does not work:

```
import matplotlib as mpl 
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Impact'
text("A text here", (1,1))
```
because of hardcoded matplotlib stylesheet (`classic`), which silently overwrites the rc parameters. Putting configurations in the file `matplotlibrc` also does not work because of the same reason.

The patch removes the hardcoded default matplotlib stylesheet that silently applies to all graphics.  With this patch, the usual method to apply a style to graphics works, like

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn')
text("A text here", (1,1))
```

There was more discussion on this matter before at [#23696 comment:111](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23696#comment:111).

For reference, I am copying below a part of this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/4I2bTb00pFg/sEWUTkeeCQAJ):

we may keep specifically only the math font of the classic style by:

```
mpl.rcParams['mathtext.fontset'] = 'cm'
mpl.rcParams['mathtext.rm'] = 'serif'
```

See [this example](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23696#comment:111) for drawbacks of using Matplolib new defaults for math fonts.
Moreover using cm fonts for math makes plots coherent with MathJax rendering of Jupyter output cells, which is an important feature IMHO.

A noticeable effect of the proposed change is that it decreases the size of figures of approx. 20% in each dimension. For instance, with the ticket branch,

```
sage: plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 4), axes_labels=['$x$', '$y$'], gridlines=True)
```
generates this 628x470 figure:
![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket25799/plot.png)

while we had previously (i.e. with the 'classic' style) this 781x584 figure:
![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket25799/plot_classic.png)

This size change was already discussed in [comment:134 of #23696](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23696#comment:134).

Other changes are the major ticks on the x-axis (Delta_x = 0.5 instead of Delta_x = 1) and the dash style (in general, dashes are narrower than with the classic style, as we can see on the dash plots in the 2D graphics section of the documentation).

I am fine with these changes (*); I simply mention them for the benefit of the discussion. 

(*) except maybe for the dash style of curves, which could require some tuning of the option `linestyle='--'` on Sage's side: compare the output of 

```
sage: g1 = plot(sin(x), 0, 2*pi)
sage: g2 = plot(cos(x), 0, 2*pi, linestyle="--")
sage: (g1+g2).show(ticks=pi/6, tick_formatter=pi)  # long time # show their sum, nicely formatted
```
in the [2D plotting](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html) section of the documentation.

On general grounds, I think it is a good thing to remove the 'classic' stylesheet (provided the TeX fonts are corrected as above), in particular because this fixes the issues mentioned in the ticket description.

It appears that now we are back to the `matching` sequence for `1.5.3` [#23696 comment:27](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23696#comment:27). This 

```
sage: two_stroke_pattern = r'setdash.*setdash.*stroke.*stroke.*setdash'
```
seems to work; although, I haven't checked whether the above `is` matched correctly when the arrow is drawn with `dashed` linetype.

This was just a shot in the dark. It doesn't work properly when the arrow is drawn with `dashed` linetype.

Just for the record, not that anything should be changed but

```
sage: two_stroke_pattern = r'setdash.*setdash.*stroke.*stroke.*setdash'
```
is the correct matching pattern. It's fairly straightforward to deduce it. I had a `typo` that led to the previous conclusion.
