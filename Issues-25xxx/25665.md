Since Sage 8.3.beta3, running the command

```
show(sphere(), viewer='threejs', online=True)
```
in a Jupyter notebook displays nothing. It was fine in Sage <= 8.3.beta2. 
Note that the option `online=True` is required by tools like http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com).

It seems that the issue is due to the following change introduced in #25040 (which has been merged in Sage 8.3.beta3):

```
sage: installed_packages()['threejs']
'r80.p0'
```
while in Sage <= 8.3.beta2, one has

```
sage: installed_packages()['threejs']
'r80'
```
Indeed the value of `installed_packages()['threejs']` is used to form the url in lines 749-750 of `src/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py`

That's a really bad idea for multiple reasons.
