In recent docker images

```
docker run -it --rm sagemath/sagemath:latest sage
sage: sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()
1
```
in 8.0 this still returned the actual number of cores.

This seems to be unrelated to the fact that this is running in the docker image.

If you just want to set the number of cores and ignore the automatic detection, you can do

```
$ docker run -e SAGE_NUM_THREADS=123 -it sagemath/sagemath sage -c 'print sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()'
Setting permissions of DOT_SAGE directory so only you can read and write it.
