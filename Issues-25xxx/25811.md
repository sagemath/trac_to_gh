As [this question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42870/using-sagemath-on-windows-10-impossible-to-attach-file/?answer=42883#post-id-42883) demonstrated, passing a Windows-style absolute path (e.g. paths starting with a drive letter) to interfaces that pass the path through `os.path.abspath` breaks on Cygwin.

This is because the `os.path` module in Python on Cygwin is just the `posixpath` module (whereas on Windows the `ntpath` module is used).  The `posixpath` module, understandably, doesn't know anything about Windows paths, which leads to incompatibilities with Cygwin's unusual hybrid path handling.

I believe this should be fixed in Python, but it might not be an easy fix to get in.  In the meantime, it would be user-friendly (albeit annoying to implement) if more user-facing functions in Sage were friendlier to Windows paths in this context.  Note, this is not a problem for all interfaces that take a filename argument.  It only appears to be a problem when filenames are passed through `os.path.abspath`, which a quick grep demonstrates that there aren't too many of.

Perhaps we could have a generic path normalization function which also takes into account the Cygwin case, and use that where appropriate.  I don't even believe this is necessary for *all* uses of `os.path.abspath` in Sage.  Only in high-level user-facing APIs like `attach()`.
