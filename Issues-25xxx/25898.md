Scenario:

```
   from sage.all import Tableau # just one of the lazy imported objects in Sage
   Tableau.foo = 3

    sage: Tableau.foo = 1
    ...
    AttributeError: 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport' object has no attribute 'foo'
```

Do you foresee any problem with just implementing `__setattr__` similarly to the current `__getattr__`?
