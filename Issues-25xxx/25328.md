Jupyter provides a `jupyter_path` function that gives back a list of paths in the right priority. Sage currently uses the apparently undocumented `ENV_JUPYTER_PATH` which is [taken into consideration in the `jupyter_path` function](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/blob/616447137a99f2437f7270dd3d8382091fb3df97/jupyter_core/paths.py#L128).

`ENV_JUPYTER_PATH` is always `[os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'share', 'jupyter')]` and not overridable by the user. `jupyter_path` prefers the `JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable when it is set. When it is not set, it first checks `jupyter_data_dir`, which apparently defaults to a user-dir (`~/.local`) and then falls back to the current behaviour (`ENV_JUPYTER_PATH`).

So in summary, this patch changes the default behaviour from using a system directory to using a user directory. It allows the user to override that directory.

Do you mean `sys.prefix` instead of `sys.path`? So where is Jupyter installed then?

Does nixos even have a concept like `sys.prefix` in the first place? Probably I don't know nixos well enough to understand the problem.

I should add that this problem is not Sage-specific. Many Jupyter packages install files in `sys.prefix/share/jupyter`. So I wonder how nixos deals with those.

Okay I guess `jupyter_path()` is meant to be used to *discover* jupyter files, not install them. That's why it gives back a list and why the user directory has highest precedence (which is correct for discovery).

It looks like jupyter doesn't provide a standard way to find the correct directory to install to. Since `ENV_JUPYTER_PATH` is hardcoded as `sys.prefix/share/jupyter` (yes I meant prefix), what do you think about adding a configuration variable to env.py that defaults  to `sys.prefix/share/jupyter`? Maybe `JUPYTER_TARGET_DIR`?

The basic idea of nix is that every package gets installed under `/nix/store/<unique-package-hash>-pkg-name` (allowing mulitple versions of a package to be installed side-by-side, guaranteeing immutability etc.).

The current jupyter version for example is in `/nix/store/siicvck75m8qw0rvs303m8svgdrp3rz1-python2.7-jupyter_core-4.4.0`. So no, there is no `sys.prefix`.

> I should add that this problem is not Sage-specific. Many Jupyter packages install files in `sys.prefix/share/jupyter`. So I wonder how nixos deals with those.

I don't know about other software with that problem. In fact jupyter support for nix is currently worked on[1] so there is not much jupyter software around yet.

But this is jupyter specific, not a standard python package.

Whatever is at fault, what do you think about the `JUPYTER_TARGET_DIR` approach? Should I implement that?

The *default* install location (using distutils) is `sys.prefix/share/jupyter` so Sage assumes that. Of course, if you patch distutils, then this might no longer be correct.\n\nSo I think the best solution might be to install the Jupyter kernel of Sage using a `setup.py` script.

I asked the question about patching distutils because most Jupyter kernels simply use `setup.py` to install those files. 

Sage has hand-written code for that (I guess mainly because some files are generated, not copied). The *default* install location (using distutils) is `sys.prefix/share/jupyter` so Sage assumes that. Of course, if you patch distutils, then this might no longer be correct.

So I think the best solution might be to install the Jupyter kernel of Sage using a `setup.py` script. Maybe we should even make it a separate package.

(Note that when I said "distutils" it applies to setuptools and pip too because those just extensions of distutils)

Yeah the `paths.jupyter_path()[0]` solution isn't viable. The `JUPYTER_TARGET_DIR` approach would remain the default unchanged but make it configurable.

Why doesn't it have anything to do with Jupyter? It is the installation location for a Jupyter package after all. Although I don't really have any strong opionion about the variable name.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:11):
> Does nixos patch distutils to install stuff in non-standard locations?

I don't think it does, but I'd have to ask our python maintainer/expert. Grepping through nixpkgs, it seems like the standard python install is basically:

```
pip install *.whl --no-index --prefix=$out --no-cache ${toString installFlags} --build tmpbuild
```

So `--prefix` has that purpose. For nixos the jupyter kernel should be installed in

/nix/store/<hash>-sage-8.2/share/jupyter

or even into a sage-jupyter directory. But sage tries to instead install it to

/nix/store/<hash>-python-2.7.14/share/jupyter

Seperating the jupyter kernel sounds like the best option to me. At least archlinux (didn't check other distros) seperates it already. I don't know enough about jupyter and sage to do that myself though.

I do set it in the installPhase:

```
python2 -u setup.py --no-user-cfg install --prefix=$out
```

If I just replace my JUPYTER_PATH patch with #25546 I get a few errors:

```
