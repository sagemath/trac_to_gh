It would be nice if we could temporarily disable the test that causes #24986 as known-problematic, at least until a fix is in (which hopefully will be soon, but probably not soon-enough).

Although I've only reproduced this issue on Cygwin, the test is theoretically a problem on any platform, though we know it passes in the general case (in fact it passes on Cygwin too--just causing minor corruption in the process).  The issue it's testing is also more to do with Cysignals than with Sage itself.

Therefor I propose that we skip it for now--that way I'll have all tests passing on Cygwin for Sage 8.2 (at least with #25077 included as well).

If this is acceptable I'll add a note to #24986 reminding to re-enable the test once the issue is fixed.
