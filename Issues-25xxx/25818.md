I just noticed this small bug in the DESTDIR build support for libpng.  This might explain why I and others sometimes have build problems surrounding libpng.

This symlink should get deleted before it's installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  Otherwise it takes a re-installation of libpng in order to force the symlink to be removed.

Fixing this (and in some cases also not fixing it) seems to break giac, which is linking with `-lpng` instead of `-lpng16`.

That would explain some of the spurious patchbot build failures I've been seeing.

Adds a patch to giac to ensure that it links against `-lpng16` when available, rather than `-lpng`.

Amusingly, *almost* the correct incantation, albeit a bit misspelled, was already in its `configure.in` but commented out.
