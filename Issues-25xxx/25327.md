Most of [the tests in #25149](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/tests/combinatorial_hopf_algebras.py?id=5a5f456ebdce848702d6dd0754ec453554b731ef) are currently invalid because of the lack of conversions. Fix that by creating coercions for all "natural inclusions" (apparently, at this point only NSym -> NCSym is missing) and conversions for canonical projections.
