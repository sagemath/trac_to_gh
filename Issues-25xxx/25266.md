At the end of https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11083-017-9422-7.pdf there is a definition of "sublattice dismantlable" lattices with a question of characterizing those.

This patch adds the function that recognized those lattices.

Requires #25244 because of crosslinks. Contains a non-related change to `posets.py`.
