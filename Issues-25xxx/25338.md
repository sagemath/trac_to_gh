Since `tensor` is functorial, we should be able to construct a morphism by

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, 'abc')
sage: phi = C.module_morphism(diagonal=lambda x: 2, codomain=C)
sage: tensor([phi,phi])

Nicolas Borie had implemented it; his code should be available somewhere (Sage-Combinat queue? some other branch? hopf algebra package? I don't remember)
