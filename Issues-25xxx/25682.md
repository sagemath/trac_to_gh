CC:  @annahaensch

The `GenusSymbol_global_ring` hides a lot of useful data from the user. 
This ticket adds some methods to access this information.

I'm just taking a first pass at reviewing the ticket, but here are a few questions/observations:

1. Maybe this is answered in the dependencies, but why is the function `Genus` being defined for a symmetric matrix rather than for a quadratic form?  Doesn't it make more sense to make it a function on the class `QuadraticForm`

2. On line 1842 there is `det = determinant` that I think doesn't need to be there, and same with `rank = dimension` on line 1445.  It would be best to stick with dimension throughout the file, and replace the word rank wherever possible.  It looks like they are always taken to be synonymous anyhow, and `dim` is the function called to compute the dimension of a quadratic form.

3. According to the sage [General Conventions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-documentation-style) your documentation should read `EXAMPLES:` with a single colon.  On the other hand, when you have WARNING/NOTE blocks those those be in the format `.. NOTE::` or `.. WARNING::` to put it as a Sphinx directive.

4. There are several instances of >= that should be replaces with `>0`.

I'll continue to look at things, but largely the file looks nice, and it's good to see this getting cleaned up and made useable!

> 4. Yep.


It looks like one error was introduced in line 1356 `A non-negative` should read `A non-negative integer`

What is going on with the imports on your docstrings?  I suspect they shouldn't be there and the imports should be happening somewhere in the preamble or some other set of imports.

1 Exactly. But let us keep that for a different ticket.
2 the equivalent would be `signature_vector` but that has 3 entries - one more for the zeros. But I guess that we can have signature and signature_pair
4 oops I will fix that.

The imports are there because nothing of this is in the global namespace at startup. So to use or doctest it, one has to import the names.
