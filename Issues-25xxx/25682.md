This ticket adds some methods to access this information.

I'm just taking a first pass at reviewing the ticket, but here are a few questions/observations:

1. Maybe this is answered in the dependencies, but why is the function `Genus` being defined for a symmetric matrix rather than for a quadratic form?  Doesn't it make more sense to make it a function on the class `QuadraticForm`

2. On line 1842 there is `det = determinant` that I think doesn't need to be there, and same with `rank = dimension` on line 1445.  It would be best to stick with dimension throughout the file, and replace the word rank wherever possible.  It looks like they are always taken to be synonymous anyhow, and `dim` is the function called to compute the dimension of a quadratic form.

3. According to the sage [General Conventions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-documentation-style) your documentation should read `EXAMPLES:` with a single colon.  On the other hand, when you have WARNING/NOTE blocks those those be in the format `.. NOTE::` or `.. WARNING::` to put it as a Sphinx directive.

4. There are several instances of >= that should be replaces with `>0`.

I'll continue to look at things, but largely the file looks nice, and it's good to see this getting cleaned up and made useable!

Does what you propose make that happen?  Can we just add a Genus wrapper to the class QuadraticForm? If so, then I am happy.  I just think it should be as easy as possible to find for QF users. \n\n> 2. Indeed `dim` and `det` are compatible with quadratic forms. I like them best. \n>    But why not keep the aliases rank and determinant? Can it hurt? If we do not, then \n>    we need to deprecate the `rank` and `determinant` methods\n>    Also `signature_pair_of_matrix` is painfully long. Maybe just `signature_pair`?\n\n\nI understand, I didn't know that syntax was fixing aliases.  In that case, certainly keep it.  Regarding `signature_pair_of_matrix`, if I understand correctly it is just returning the signature of the original quadratic form (ie tuple of pos and neg Eigenvalues for the Hessian), such a function exists for the QuadraticForm class, and it is just called `signature`. It would be nice if these matched as closely as possible.  I am happy with `signature_pair`.\n\n> 3. As for the examples, whether of not there is a double colon depends on what comes \n>    next. If it is more text, then a single colon. If it is a block of sage examples, \n>    then a double colon. Can you point me at the lines you mean?\n\n\nGood to know, I never realized that.  Lines 926 and 1453 had the occurrences WARNING/NOTE that I mentioned, but it looks like you fixed those in the last commit.  \n\n> 4. Yep.\n\n\nIt looks like one error was introduced in line 1356 `A non-negative` should read `A non-negative integer`\n\nWhat is going on with the imports on your docstrings?  I suspect they shouldn't be there and the imports should be happening somewhere in the preamble or some other set of imports.",

I'm not sure how exactly that works, but I would want to be able to construct a quadratic form, like `Q=QuadraticForm(ZZ,2,[1,2,2])` and then ask for `Q.Genus()`. Does what you propose make that happen?  Can we just add a Genus wrapper to the class QuadraticForm? If so, then I am happy.  I just think it should be as easy as possible to find for QF users.

I understand, I didn't know that syntax was fixing aliases.  In that case, certainly keep it.  Regarding `signature_pair_of_matrix`, if I understand correctly it is just returning the signature of the original quadratic form (ie tuple of pos and neg Eigenvalues for the Hessian), such a function exists for the QuadraticForm class, and it is just called `signature`. It would be nice if these matched as closely as possible.  I am happy with `signature_pair`.

Good to know, I never realized that.  Lines 926 and 1453 had the occurrences WARNING/NOTE that I mentioned, but it looks like you fixed those in the last commit.  

> 4. Yep.


It looks like one error was introduced in line 1356 `A non-negative` should read `A non-negative integer`

What is going on with the imports on your docstrings?  I suspect they shouldn't be there and the imports should be happening somewhere in the preamble or some other set of imports.

1 Exactly. But let us keep that for a different ticket.

4 oops I will fix that.

The imports are there because nothing of this is in the global namespace at startup. So to use or doctest it, one has to import the names.

You need to change `"""` to `r"""` at the beginning of every docstring that contains a latex macro such as \ZZ, \in, \{, etc

You then can use `pycodestyle --select=W605 	src/sage/quadratic_forms/genera/genus.py` if you want to check.
