I am currently playing with airspeed velocity to track speed regressions in Sage. I would like to benchmark every doctest that has a `long time` or `benchmark` marker in it and also benchmark every method that has a `time_` prefix (probably only in some benchmark module.)

We have something similar set up for https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/tree/master/mclf/benchmarks now. There are only two benchmarks but it works nicely.

I ran the above proposal for all the tags from 8.3.beta0 to 8.3. There's a lot of noise (because there was other activity on the machine) but you get the idea: https://saraedum.github.io/sage/

Another interesting demo of airspeedvelocity that is not related to Sage is here: https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/#/regressions

Great! It's an excellent tool and I've wanted to see it used for Sage for a long time, but wasn't sure where to begin.  In case it helps I know and have worked with its creator personally.

This is the "hard part" that I mentioned in [comment:3]. Ideally, we shouldn't have to guess where regressions might occur, the tool would do that for us. I believe that the intention of #12720 was to integrate this in the doctest framework such that all(?) doctests would also be regression tests.

But that's probably not feasible, so here is a more productive answer:

1. All `# long time` tests should definitely be regression tests.

2. For each `Parent` (more precisely: every time that a `TestSuite` appears in a doctest): test creating a parent, test creating elements, test some basic arithmetic (also with elements of different such that we check the coercion model too).

Adding a new method for each regression tests sounds quite heavy. Could it be possible to integrate this in doctests instead? I would love to do

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: some_sage_code()  # airspeed
```

I could imagine situation where I would be curious to know how the speed of a given doctest (granularity to be discussed) has evolved over time. Or where I would like to investigate how this or that (collection of) doctest was impacted by this or that ticket.

So even though having info about all doctests would indeed pollute the main "speed regression" report it could till be interesting to harvest it, and make it available with some search mechanism.

Of course this is just "good to have", if not too costly to implement/produce/store/serve.

Actually "about 48h" is incorrect. It's probably more than 24h and less than 48h. But I did not really check the times.

I have not looked into these. Some of the empty graphs are because the benchmark timed out after 60s. That could be changed of course.

I guess, now that I think about it, if you were doing each release between 8.2 and 8.3 you also had to do incremental builds of each of those, which could take some time as well, especially if it was just on your laptop, which you were also doing other work on.

Normally this wouldn't be a problem for machines generating new benchmark results between each release.

We could improve it somewhat but I would like to have a hash in there somewhere and it also has to be a valid Python2 method name.

This is really some black metaclass magic to have asv detect one benchmark method for every doctest we have. Let me try to explain how this goes roughly.

ASV first runs a "discovery" where it collects all the benchmarks (by looking for methods that start with certain prefixes such as `time_`.) Then it invokes itself once for each such method to run the actual benchmark.

To trick the discovery into finding a method for every doctest, I implement `__dir__` on the `BenchmarkMetaclass` to run all doctests in the Sage library but without actually running the code. Instead I just print the expected output to have them all pass as quickly as possible and track their existence. Here, I create a hash of the doctest so I can find it again in the second pass of ASV.

Then when ASV actually tries to run, say `__init__.Benchmarks.track__families__RingedTree__62b2284259a21f85bd8db00b8522ad3b`, I inject that method in `__getattr__` and have it run all the doctests in `**/families*.pyx?` but again I actually skip all the doctests except for the first one that produces 62b2284259a21f85bd8db00b8522ad3b as its hash. I time every line of that doctest and return these timings as the result to ASV.

I've been poking around a bit more in the ASV source, and am going to see what I can come up with.

1. There is a base `Benchmark` class that I believe we can customize just a little bit for our purposes, and the rest of the code is flexible enough that we should be able to add our custom Benchmark class to the list of known benchmark types (`asv.benchmark.benchmark_types`).  Ideally a plugin would be able to do this without modifying any internal data structures.  (In fact, now I'm thinking we may not even need any Benchmark subclasses if our custom discovery code is clever enough...)

2. The main thing, then, that we need to customize is benchmark discovery.  Currently there's no great way to do this and this is where another plugin interface is needed.  The current plugin discovery process ultimately yields `Benchmark` instances which contain all the information needed for a single benchmark test (it also wraps the benchmark function itself--in this case we can either generate a function from the doctest, or use a standard function for running a single doctest).  What we need then is a way to extend the benchmark discovery process to allow discovery from arbitrary sources (rather than just searching the file system for .py files and importing them).

3. Relatedly, there is a function `asv.benchmark.get_benchmark_from_name` which resolves a unique benchmark name to the relevant test.  A plugin needs to be able to extend how benchmarks are searched for by name.

I don't like this part because it doesn't mix well with doctests. I would really want to write a doctest like

```
sage: a = something
sage: b = otherthing
sage: c = computation(a, b)  # benchmark this
```
and being forced to wrap this in a `time_` method is just ugly.

I see. I think it would be easy to track lines that say, e.g., `# benchmark time` separately. I am not sure if it's a good idea to add more magic comments to our doctesting. I've nothing against them in general, I am just worried that these features are relatively obscure so not many people are going to use them?

Let me try to start with the benchmarking of blocks that say `# long time` and add more features later.

Just two cents without having though two much about it.

I like the `# benchmark` approach too. It mixes well with how we write doctests and makes it trivial to create new benchmarks / annotate things as useful to benchmark.

I'd rather have a different annotation than `# long time`; otherwise devs will have to take a decision between benchmarking and running the tests always, not just with `--long`.

Of course, at this stage using `# long time` is a good way for experimenting. And it may be reasonable to keep benchmarking `# long time` lines later on.

Thanks!

Yes, something like that could be done.  Again, it all comes down to providing a different benchmark discovery plugin for ASV.  For discovering benchmarks in our doctest, all lines leading up to a `# benchmark` line could be considered setup code, with the `# benchmark` line being the one actually benchmarked (obviously).

Multiple `# benchmark` tests in the same file would work fine too, with every line prior to it (including other previously benchmarked lines) considered the setup for it.

It might be trickier to do this in such a way that avoids duplication but I'll think about that.  I think it could still be done.

Presumably time benchmarking is more usual than memory benchmarking, so I would tend to
have "benchmark" be a short hand for "benchmark time", but that may be just me.

For memory usage, do you foresee using fine grained tools that instrument the code and actually slow down the execution? Otherwise, could "benchmark" just do both always?

Now that the CI seems to be mostly stable (except for the docbuild timing out for `test-dev`) we should probably look into this again?

I would like to get a minimal version of this working somehow. We should probably not attempt to get the perfect solution in the first run. The outputs this created are actually quite useful already imho. If our contributors actually end up looking at the results, we can add more features (more keywords, more iterations, memory benchmarking, comparisons to other CAS,…)

So, my proposal would be to go with this version (modulo cleanup & documentation & CI integration.) If somebody wants to improve/reimplement this in a good way, I am very happy to review that later.

I am not sure how much time I will have to work on this so if anybody wants to get more involved, please let me know :)

I am thinking about reviving this issue with a different application in mind that is a bit easier than regression testing. Namely, to have a better understanding how different values for the `algorithm` keyword affect runtime.

I find that we rarely update the default algorithms. However, this could be quite beneficial say when we upgrade a dependency such as PARI or FLINT. It would be very nice to easily see how the different algorithms perform after an update and also a way to document the instances that have been used to determine the cutoffs that we are using.

Currently, we are using some homegrown solutions for this, e.g., `matrix/benchmark.py` or `misc/benchmark.py`.

There's no fundamental problem. But doing the CI setup is quite a bit of work.
