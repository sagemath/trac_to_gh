What don't you use `coprime_integers` in `src/sage/rings/finite_ring/integer_mod_ring.py` (at line 605, that you changed)? Is it a mere oversight or is there a reason I don't get?

Also there remain quite a few occurrences where `coprime_integers` could be used. Do you plan to replace all of them?

In integer_mod_ring, I left it because I was not sure that it would be a good idea to return a list of sage integers instead of a list of int.

No, I do not plan to do anything else in this ticket.

Thanks for the review. Do you agree that what is done is correct and useful?
