While this may fix the plotting issue, it hides the real problem:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(2); N
2-d lattice N
sage: NQ = N.base_extend(QQ); NQ
Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: r = N.gen(0); r
N(1, 0)
sage: S = N.submodule([r]); S
Sublattice <N(1, 0)>
sage: SQ = S.base_extend(QQ); SQ
 
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[1 0]
sage: r in N, r in NQ
(True, True)
sage: r in S, r in SQ
(True, False)
```
Why is there this difference in behaviour of vector spaces and subspaces? The original code likely worked for halfplanes when it was written and there is no reason for it to stop.

Looking at the file `src/sage/structure/parent.pyx` in the `__contains__` function, it returns `False` because:

```
sage: type(r)
<class 'sage.geometry.toric_lattice_element.ToricLatticeElement'>
sage: r2 = SQ(r); r2
(1, 0)
sage: type(r2)
<class 'sage.modules.vector_rational_dense.Vector_rational_dense'>
```

and

```
sage: r2 == r
False
```

Now, should this return `True`? I am not sure how to fix this...

I was juuuust about to agree with you. But the underlying problem here is serious. Equality is not transitive:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(2)                                                       
sage: NQ = N.base_extend(QQ)                                                    
sage: r = N.gen(0)                                                              
sage: S = N.submodule([r])                                                      
sage: SQ = S.base_extend(QQ)                                                    
sage: r == S(r)                                                                 
True
sage: S(r) == SQ(r)                                                             
True
sage: r == SQ(r)                                                                
False
```
