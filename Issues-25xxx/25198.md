I was lead here because Volker selected this ticket for inclusion in his merging branch and when I looked on github to see the content of the commit, it came empty. https://github.com/vbraun/sage/commit/0c158cae89a87820ee5e4bb5b7a8f9a911210aaa

Then clicking here resulted in a failure to merge.  So Volker will need to re-merge this one now.

Ping @vbraun the content of this ticket is currently missing in the merge.

(Edited, because I was mistaken slightly about the relation of this ticket to #24919.)

This doesn't seem right.  This branch just looks identical to the one on #25857 now.
However, this branch should not actually be merged anyways.

These changes are already included implicitly in #24919 which is positively reviewed and should be merged.

The reason this is confusing is that I worked on this ticket at the same time as #24919, but #24919 redid a lot of configure stuff so it included those changes by necessity.

If we just merge #24919, this ticket can be closed as fixed.

I take it back.  Apparently I'm wrong.  #24919 does not incorporate all elements of this ticket.  Apparently at some point I decoupled them somewhat.

I'll create a new branch...
