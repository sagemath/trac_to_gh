(Edited, because I was mistaken slightly about the relation of this ticket to #24919.)

This doesn't seem right.  This branch just looks identical to the one on #25857 now.
However, this branch should not actually be merged anyways.

These changes are already included implicitly in #24919 which is positively reviewed and should be merged.

The reason this is confusing is that I worked on this ticket at the same time as #24919, but #24919 redid a lot of configure stuff so it included those changes by necessity.

If we just merge #24919, this ticket can be closed as fixed.
