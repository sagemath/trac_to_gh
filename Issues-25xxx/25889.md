In Singular, if `id` is an ideal given by a standard basis and `P` is a list of polynomials, then `std(id,P)` is computing a standard basis for the ideal generated by `id` and `P`. It is supposed to take into account that `id` is a standard basis, which means that a lot of critical pairs can be discarded.

However, the current Singular version does in fact considers a lot of unnecessary critical pairs in `std(id,P)`, as I uncovered in my cohomology computations.

Hans Schönemann found a fix that will be part of the next Singular release and also helped me to backport that fix to the Singular version that currently is in Sage. I suggest to add this to `build/pkgs/singular/patches`.

I have attached an example (actually from some cohomology computation, but the example is stand-alone).

Start Sage's Singular (`sage -singular`) and do

```
> execute(read("example.sing"));
```

With the patch, it finishes quite soon, and the protocol output shows that almost no work needed to be done. Without the patch, you have to be very patient.

By the way, I tested that `make test` passes with the patch.

Right, you said that p_group_cohomology still works with #24735, and trouble only start with #25993. Anyway, I should create a package version that works with both...

- The bug is not a bug in the sense of giving wrong results, but a bug in the sense of "slow in some exotic situations that is relevant in some extreme examples of the pet project of one developer (me)". In fact I only know a single example (computation of a filter regular system of parameters of the modular cohomology ring of group number 299 of order 256) where not fixing the bug really hurts. So, one could argue that it isn't particularly urgent to fix.
- "Some point in the future" is #25993, so, the future is there. One could argue that #25933 supersedes this ticket, making this ticket a duplicate.
- Did you delete the commit on purpose?
