In Singular, if `id` is an ideal given by a standard basis and `P` is a list of polynomials, then `std(id,P)` is computing a standard basis for the ideal generated by `id` and `P`. It is supposed to take into account that `id` is a standard basis, which means that a lot of critical pairs can be discarded.

However, the current Singular version does in fact considers a lot of unnecessary critical pairs in `std(id,P)`, as I uncovered in my cohomology computations.

Hans Schönemann found a fix that will be part of the next Singular release and also helped me to backport that fix to the Singular version that currently is in Sage. I suggest to add this to `build/pkgs/singular/patches`.

I have attached an example (actually from some cohomology computation, but the example is stand-alone).

Start Sage's Singular (`sage -singular`) and do

```
> execute(read("example.sing"));
```

With the patch, it finishes quite soon, and the protocol output shows that almost no work needed to be done. Without the patch, you have to be very patient.

By the way, I tested that `make test` passes with the patch.

 However, the current Singular version does in fact considers a lot of unnecessary critical pairs in `std(id,P)`, as I uncovered in my cohomology computations.
 
 Hans Schönemann found a fix that will be part of the next Singular release and also helped me to backport that fix to the Singular version that currently is in Sage. I suggest to add this to `build/pkgs/singular/patches`.

Well, the bug fixed by this patch is not yielding wrong results but yielding very slow computations in a situation that I care about.

From my perspective, it would be perfectly alright to resolve this ticket as "wontfix", given that there is a realistic perspective that soonish (namely with #25993) the issue will be fixed without a backported patch.

Jeroen, do I understand correctly: Based on #24735, I should create a new ticket for group cohomology, implementing things so that it works both with Singular-4.1.1.p2 and ...p3, and this new ticket would be a dependency for #25933?

- The bug is not a bug in the sense of giving wrong results, but a bug in the sense of "slow in some exotic situations that is relevant in some extreme examples of the pet project of one developer (me)". In fact I only know a single example (computation of a filter regular system of parameters of the modular cohomology ring of group number 299 of order 256) where not fixing the bug really hurts.

- "Some point in the future" is #25993, so, the future is there. One could argue that #25933 supersedes this ticket, making this ticket a duplicate.
- Did you delete the commit on purpose?
