sage: G1.is_isomorphic(G2)
True
```

#24898 was not enough. 

This ticket removes `'tedder'` implementation, as buggy unfixable abandonware (see #33902 for another example of a bug);
the `algorithm=` option is made into a no-op, to be removed after the deprecation period, as we only have one implementation now.

I don't know if this helps, but I was cross-checking #25763 and it seems that the bug is not visible with

`P._hasse_diagram.transitive_closure().to_undirected().is_prime()`

where `P` is any poset. In the internal digraph we have consecutive integers as vertices and `0, 1, ..., n-1` is a topological sort of the digraph.

I tried other labelings of the graph and its working correctly when the first vertex of `G.vertex_iterator()` is not involved in the parallel node. 

```
sage: G3 = Graph('F|NE?')
sage: G3.modular_decomposition()
(PRIME, [2, (PARALLEL, [5, 6]), 1, 3, 0, 4])
```

With 'G2', the construction starts from vertex 0 that should be in a parallel node `(PARALLEL, [0, 1])`. If I add a twin to vertex 4, the new parallel node is detected.

```
sage: G2.add_edges([(2,7), (3,7)])
sage: G2.modular_decomposition()
(PRIME, [6, 5, 0, 2, 3, 1, (PARALLEL, [4, 7])])
```

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

A few questions.

Would it be of use to add an `algorithm` parameter to `modular_decomposition` and `is_prime`?  I have code for the O(n<sup>3</sup>) algorithm of [Habib and Maurer 1979] that is probably slower than the current code, but seems to work.  Should I attempt to integrate it, and if so should I do it in this ticket or start a new one?

Should we move `modular_decomposition.py` into the `src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions` directory?

In the testing section of `modular_decomposition.py` the function `children_node_type` is used to flag an error if all of the children of a SERIES or PARALLEL node are of the same type as their parent.  I think that this is too loose and an error should be noted if any of the children have the same type as their parents, otherwise the condition that nodes in the tree represent maximal modules is violated.

This is a very good idea to add another algorithm and the parameter `algorithm` if it helps checking the validity of both algorithms. A slow algorithm is OK in such case.
However, it should be done in a separate ticket.

It is possible to move the file to `src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions` while working on the new ticket.

`algorithm='tedder'` should be an error now. 

The problem is, however, not limited to this, as there is also a `modular_decomposition(foo)` function, which was equivalent to `foo.modular_decomposition(algorithm='tedder')`. In the present branch `modular_decomposition(foo)` became
equivalent to the (old) `foo.modular_decomposition(algorithm='habib')`, because, what else?

I think it's too much fuss to fiddle around with deprecations here.
