<a id='comment:3'></a>Some non-math comments:

Some tweaks to the reference

```
.. [HS2018] \B. Hutz, M. Stoll. "Smallest representatives of
            `\SL(2,\ZZ)`-orbits of binary forms and endomorphisms of P1",
            :arxiv:`1805.08579`, 2018.
```
Although I am not sure `\SL` is a valid latex macro for our docbuild. I would use `\mathrm{SL}` or just `SL`.

You can use `True` and `False` for the `all_orbits` input:

```
sage: int(True)
1
sage: int(False)
0
```

This doc is contradictory:

```
    - ``return_transformation`` -- (default: False) a boolean value, default value True. This
      signals a return of the ``PGL_2`` transformation to conjugate ``vp`` to
      the calculated minimal model
```
I would also recommend formatting as

```
    - ``return_transformation`` -- (default: ``False``) boolean; this
      signals a return of the ``PGL_2`` transformation to conjugate ``vp`` to
      the calculated minimal model
```

I would recommend the formatting:

```
    OUTPUT:

    - list of pairs ``[f, m]`` where ``f`` is a dynamical system and ``m`` is a
      `2 \times 2` matrix
```

You can use ``SL(2,\ZZ)`` everywhere in your function docs (including the first sentence).

For the `algorithm` input, I would just use `BM` and `HS`. I think the year is unimportant and makes it (very mildly) harder on the user.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Some other non-math comments (to whomever else is reading this, I just need you to check the math content to make sure it works):

- the ``return_transformation`` input needs 2 spaces more of indentation in `affine_minimal()`
- this is a contradiction:

      signals a return of the ``PGL_2`` transformation to conjugate ``vp`` to

  }}}
  See also comment:3 for formatting.
- This is a bad indentation:
  {{{
    OUTPUT: list of pairs ``[f, m]`` where ``f`` is a dynamical system and ``m`` is a
      `2 \times 2` matrix.
  }}}
  I would instead format it as

   }}}
   In particular, I worry `\Z` would result in an error in build the pdf docs (but maybe its okay, I haven't checked) and there was no spacing after `M.` (which does not require the escape character because it is not the first character of the reference).
