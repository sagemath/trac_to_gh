Goal: implement a signed version of (co)product structure on tensor products of graded (or super) (co)algebras. We should be able to define  superalgebras `A` and `B` and specify that when they are tensored together, the product structure has this property

```
(x1 tensor y1) (x2 tensor y2) = (-1)^{(deg y1) (deg x2)} (x1 x2 tensor y1 y2).
```
(And similarly for coalgebras.) The underlying algebras need not be graded commutative themselves. The Steenrod algebra is one use case – it is noncommutative, but we definitely want this property when defining the product on its tensor square.

I don't understand what you mean, probably because I don't understand the category theory framework in Sage, which I am going to blame on the state of the documentation. What is the role of axioms vs. categories vs. Python classes? In my experience, by the way, inheritance with axioms doesn't always work the way you might want, because it doesn't override methods which are inherited from other Python classes.

In this particular situation, only methods which deal with tensor products should be affected, so I think you're overstating things when you talk about potentially having to change every method for algebras.

Categories for `SuperModules` and `SuperAlgebras` already exist in Sage, so I'm not sure what you mean by the first sentence. Also, are you suggesting that for superalgebras (for example), the signed tensor product should be the default behavior? I think in the past you have argued against this being the default behavior in the graded case.

Implementing some sort of braiding sounds great, but not for this ticket, and not as a prerequisite for this ticket.

Yeah, that braiding suggestion was probably overkill, sorry.

And if we have `SuperAlgebras` and `SuperModules`, then we should use them, not push another axiom on Algebras.

I don't think that "only methods which deal with tensor products should be affected"; tensors can be multiplied back in a Hopf algebra, and various constructions in a Hopf algebra involve delta-ing out, messing with the tensors, and then multiplying back. They all slightly change if the algebra becomes super.

So should `SuperAlgebras` (or at least `WithBasis`) have this sign by default when taking tensor products? Or do we need a new category?

And I'm still interested in why a category rather than an axiom. Your first post seemed to be operating from some set of principles, but I don't know what those principles are or where they are documented. I would be happy to hear more.

> I don't think that "only methods which deal with tensor products should be affected"; tensors can be multiplied back in a Hopf algebra, and various constructions in a Hopf algebra involve delta-ing out, messing with the tensors, and then multiplying back.

Not in characteristic 2 :p

They also don't change unless you are (implicitly or explicitly) interchanging tensor factors. I'm curious about mathematical examples of such constructions. The only examples that I can find in the actual Sage category code are the product for tensor products of algebras and `_test_antipode` for Hopf algebras. (There should also be a coproduct for tensor products of coalgebras, but it apparently hasn't been implemented.)

In fact, `some_elements` is broken for exterior algebras:

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: E.some_elements()
[x^y + 2*x + 3*y + 1]
```
"`x^y`"??? I don't know how `TestSuite(E).run()` passes in vanilla Sage. I've opened up #25630 for this.

By the way, exterior algebras provide another instance of the bug referenced in [comment:1](#comment%3A1):

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: x**2
0
sage: x.coproduct()
1 # x + x # 1
sage: (x.coproduct())**2 # should be 0
2*x # x
```

Here is a new version which just incorporates the sign into super modules/algebras/whatever (although not implemented for everything, just for the tensor product for super algebras and `_test_antipode` for super Hopf algebras).

Note also that without this branch, elements of an `ExteriorAlgebra` do not have an `antipode`, so the `TestSuite` for such an algebra skips the antipode testing. With this branch, the antipode is tested (and passes).

The default implement of `some_elements` returned `[self.an_element()]` and you should be able to modify this test so that `_test_antipode` verifies this identity for inhomogeneous elements.

`self._sets` is the list of the tensor factors of `self` – a list of super algebras. When you compute the product

```
(a_0 tensor a_1 tensor ... tensor a_{n-1}) (b_0 tensor b_1 tensor ... tensor b_{n-1})
```
you have to commute `b_1` past `a_i` for `i` between 1 and `n-1`, and each such interchange multiplies by (-1) raised to the appropriate power. Multiplying the powers of (-1) for all of these interchanges corresponds to first adding all of the powers and then raising (-1) to that power.

This is what turns on the `antipode` method for elements of exterior algebras, for example. I'd like to treat super Hopf algebras as graded Hopf algebras, except we can override the necessary methods in, for example, `super_hopf_algebras_with_basis.py`.

What would you suggest instead?

(This was essentially copied from hopf_algebra.py.) Then within Sage:

sage: from sage.categories.super_hopf_algebras import SuperHopfAlgebras
sage: H = SuperHopfAlgebras(QQ)
sage: H

or more succinctly:

```

If I evaluate `H.dual??`, it does not give me `return self` as the source code. Where is it inheriting from? And why? Is the `dual` method in the old hopf_algebra.py just a red herring?

I feel like I'm just trying things at random here, cutting and pasting from various files in the categories directory, and it's not enjoyable. Why does `HopfAlgebras` in `hopf_algebras.py` have a `super_categories` method, as compared to `SuperAlgebras` which has an `extra_super_categories` method? Which should I use for `SuperHopfAlgebras`? Which for `SuperHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`?

Moving `def dual` to the `ParentMethods` section makes no difference, not that I understand why it would. Note also that in `hopf_algebra.py`, `def dual` is not in `ParentMethods`. So I'm still confused about this.

I created a file `super_coalgebras.py`, modeling it on `super_algebras.py`:

```
class SuperCoalgebras(SuperModulesCategory):

    def extra_super_categories(self):
        return [self.base_category().Graded()]
```
I also modified `coalgebras.py` by removing the `class Super(...)`. But this didn't work: I got

And of course, if anyone manages to answer these questions, I fully expect to get stuck 5 minutes later on something else. I just don't understand enough of the category framework to do this in anything approaching an efficient way. So I really think someone else should take over, if you're not happy with the current approach. Or accept this approach for now and open a followup ticket to use a better approach – I would appreciate this if otherwise this ticket might get delayed for a significant amount of time.

Did you add a redirect from coalgebras to the super version? Coalgebras still needs to know what class its super version is. (See, e.g., `ModulesWithBasis`.)

I will take over then and try to get this to a workable state.

I ask that if there is no better solution available by the end of the summer, you seriously consider accepting my approach.

Whatever we do, we need to document it very well, because I think that different people use "graded Hopf algebra" (for example) to mean different things. In algebraic topology, it includes the sign in the tensor product, and I am deducing that this is not the case in combinatorics, right?

I would also point out that so far in Sage, "super" just means Z/2-graded (from what I see in a few docstrings), and therefore any "super blah" should also be a "blah" and a "graded blah". So maybe "super Hopf algebra" is not the right name in Sage for the objects which have this sign on the tensor product. Either that or we need to clarify the documentation for what "super" means in Sage, or at least what "super Hopf algebra" means, pointing out that in Sage, if this is indeed the choice we make, a "super Hopf algebra" need not be a Hopf algebra while a "graded Hopf algebra" is one.

Actually, given the conflict in what "graded Hopf algebra" means to different mathematicians, my inclination would be to avoid the phrase altogether, and instead have something like "Hopf algebra with grading" for the combinatorial version, and I'm not sure what for the algebraic topology version.

The problem is: you can say that a superalgebra is an algebra with extra structure, but a tensor product of superalgebras is not a tensor product of the underlying algebras with extra structure. And I don't know if this kind of nuance can survive the Sage category framework.

Super-Hopf algebra with grading, I'd say. I would otherwise call it graded super-Hopf algebra or graded Hopf superalgebra.

Thanks very much for working on this! I see one doctest failure with Python 2 (easy to fix):

```
File "src/sage/categories/with_realizations.py", line 262, in sage.categories.with_realizations.WithRealizations
Failed example:
    C.super_categories()
Expected:
    [Join of Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field
         and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field]
Got:
    [Join of Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field and Category of graded coalgebras over Rational Field]
```
I see a few more with Python 3:

```
File "src/sage/categories/supercommutative_algebras.py", line 77, in sage.categories.supercommutative_algebras.SupercommutativeAlgebras.WithBasis.ParentMethods._test_supercommutativity
Failed example:
    E._test_supercommutativity()

1 item had failures:
   1 of   5 in sage.categories.supercommutative_algebras.SupercommutativeAlgebras.WithBasis.ParentMethods._test_supercommutativity
```
and failures from the same deprecation warning in `algebras/clifford_algebra.py`.

(I haven't actually run the full test suite, just tests in `algebras` and `categories`.)

I'll be working my way through the code.

I think this looks good, but I'm going to keep banging away at it for a few days.

A few questions:
- This is probably overkill, but in characteristic 2, would it make sense to automatically convert super -> graded (over Z/2), since there are no signs involved? Probably not worth it, but in characteristic 2, exterior algebras are honest Hopf algebras, as is the mod 2 Steenrod algebra.
- Why this asymmetry?

```
sage: AlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).Super().super_categories()
[Category of graded algebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of super algebras over Rational Field,
 Category of super modules with basis over Rational Field]
sage: CoalgebrasWithBasis(QQ).Super().super_categories()
[Category of super modules with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of coalgebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of super coalgebras over Rational Field]
```
 Should "Category of *graded* coalgebras with basis ..." be among the super categories in the second case, rather than just "Category of coalgebras with basis ..."?

That was a bug. Good catch. I forgot to add the `extra_super_categories` for that class.

Curiously enough with this branch, I am actually getting back the behavior on that comment. So something very subtle is going on, but the MRO issue seems to still be resolved. The reason why I mentioned those tickets was because the MRO issue reminded me of them, but that seems to be a red herring. Curious...

Note that Bugs Bunny, in his answer, does something very similar to what you guys have agreed on (I think?): use different symbols \otimes and \otimes^{sup} for tensors and super-tensors, even at the level of elements.

The "Supercommutative" and "Supercocommutative" axioms imply "Super" Hopf algebra, so is this necessary?

Maybe a graded object should have a method or attribute `grading_group` (or whatever you want to call it). I'm not sure how else you would convey this information, because `GradedSuperHopfAlgebras...` is redundant: super implies graded, and "graded" should make no assumptions about what the grading group is.

At least with the Steenrod algebra, there is a method `homogeneous_component` which takes a degree as input and returns the finite dimensional vector space, with basis, for the component in that degree.

Thank you for answering. I just forgot to do that yesterday. `^^;;`

As John said, the implication is already there. So adding `Super` to the first category is overkill.

I'm not sure how else you would convey this information, because `GradedSuperHopfAlgebras...` is redundant: super implies graded, and "graded" should make no assumptions about what the grading group is. You could have `GradedConnectedSuperHopfAlgebras...` because graded + connected implies a Z-grading (at least to me: it doesn't mean "connected as a Hopf algebra" + "graded as a (super) Hopf algebra").


Super implies graded for modules/algebras/etc. (but not as Hopf algebras). The super stuff is controlled by the `is_even_odd` method that outputs something in **Z**2**Z**. You can have the normal **Z** grading, and as long as whatever grading is naturally compatible with the super grading, you should not have to do anything more.

Yes because we cannot do anything special with them other than mark them at this point. Although we could add a test for cocommutative coalgebras with basis to check that it is cocommutative.

So should supercommutative only be there for algebras? In both cases, it is just a convenience method to shortcut doing `Algebras(QQ).Super().Supercommutative()` and similarly for coalgebras. -1 for removing them.

Yes, I just forgot to change this when I moved it. Feel free to add.

This already is there and was added as per your request when we first did the super stuff; see `coalgebras.py`. For the commutative, we already are explicitly forbidding commutative to be passed; see `super_modules.py`. So adding more tests of this form is redundant IMO.

I don't get it. Supercommutative makes no sense as an axiom on a Hopf algebra. Super is not an axiom for Hopf algebras.

As soon as you make something supercommutative, you make it into its super version (which, as you note, is not an axiom (but instead a functorial construction)). It is the same as soon as you create the graded `X` it also knows that it is a filtered `X`.
