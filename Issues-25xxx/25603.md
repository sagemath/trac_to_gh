Goal: implement a signed version of (co)product structure on tensor products of graded (or super) (co)algebras. We should be able to define  superalgebras `A` and `B` and specify that when they are tensored together, the product structure has this property

```
(x1 tensor y1) (x2 tensor y2) = (-1)^{(deg y1) (deg x2)} (x1 x2 tensor y1 y2).
```
(And similarly for coalgebras.) The underlying algebras need not be graded commutative themselves. The Steenrod algebra is one use case – it is noncommutative, but we definitely want this property when defining the product on its tensor square.

`TensorGradedWithSign` should not be an axiom! It changes the behavior of certain methods; axioms lead to default inheritance, so (in theory) every method built for an algebra would have to be overloaded for a superalgebra in order not to give wrong results.

I don't understand what you mean, probably because I don't understand the category theory framework in Sage, which I am going to blame on the state of the documentation.

In this particular situation, only methods which deal with tensor products should be affected, so I think you're overstating things when you talk about potentially having to change every method for algebras.

Yeah, that braiding suggestion was probably overkill, sorry.

And if we have `SuperAlgebras` and `SuperModules`, then we should use them, not push another axiom on Algebras.

I don't think that "only methods which deal with tensor products should be affected"; tensors can be multiplied back in a Hopf algebra, and various constructions in a Hopf algebra involve delta-ing out, messing with the tensors, and then multiplying back. They all slightly change if the algebra becomes super.

So should `SuperAlgebras` (or at least `WithBasis`) have this sign by default when taking tensor products? Or do we need a new category?

And I'm still interested in why a category rather than an axiom. Your first post seemed to be operating from some set of principles, but I don't know what those principles are or where they are documented. I would be happy to hear more.

Not in characteristic 2 :p

They also don't change unless you are (implicitly or explicitly) interchanging tensor factors. I'm curious about mathematical examples of such constructions.

Right.

`self._sets` is the list of the tensor factors of `self` – a list of super algebras. When you compute the product

```
(a_0 tensor a_1 tensor ... tensor a_{n-1}) (b_0 tensor b_1 tensor ... tensor b_{n-1})
```
you have to commute `b_1` past `a_i` for `i` between 1 and `n-1`, and each such interchange multiplies by (-1) raised to the appropriate power. Multiplying the powers of (-1) for all of these interchanges corresponds to first adding all of the powers and then raising (-1) to that power.

This is what turns on the `antipode` method for elements of exterior algebras, for example. I'd like to treat super Hopf algebras as graded Hopf algebras, except we can override the necessary methods in, for example, `super_hopf_algebras_with_basis.py`.

What would you suggest instead?

If they implement a test for it, which then fails on exterior algebras or odd primary Steenrod algebras, they'll know.

On a branch on my computer, I wrote versions of super_coalgebras.py, super_bialgebras.py, super_hopf_algebras.py, and I get behavior that I just can't understand. In super_hopf_algebras.py`, for example (omitting docstrings for brevity):

```
class SuperHopfAlgebras(SuperModulesCategory):

    def super_categories(self):
        R = self.base_ring()
        return [SuperBialgebras(R)]

    def dual(self):
        return self
```
(This was essentially copied from hopf_algebra.py.) Then within Sage:

```
sage: from sage.categories.super_hopf_algebras import SuperHopfAlgebras
sage: H = SuperHopfAlgebras(QQ)
sage: H
Category of super hopf algebras over Rational Field
sage: H.dual()
Join of Category of duals of coalgebras over Rational Field and Category of duals of algebras over Rational Field
```
or more succinctly:

```
sage: H.dual() == H # should return True
False
```
If I evaluate `H.dual??`, it does not give me `return self` as the source code. Where is it inheriting from? And why? Is the `dual` method in the old hopf_algebra.py just a red herring?

If someone else wants to take this over, or wants to explain it to me clearly and in short sentences, great. Otherwise, I may be forced to leave this as is and hope it's good enough.

You have put `dual` in the category, not the `ParentMethods`. So that is why it is not working.

I feel like I'm just trying things at random here, cutting and pasting from various files in the categories directory, and it's not enjoyable. Why does `HopfAlgebras` in `hopf_algebras.py` have a `super_categories` method, as compared to `SuperAlgebras` which has an `extra_super_categories` method? Which should I use for `SuperHopfAlgebras`? Which for `SuperHopfAlgebrasWithBasis`?

Moving `def dual` to the `ParentMethods` section makes no difference, not that I understand why it would. Note also that in `hopf_algebra.py`, `def dual` is not in `ParentMethods`. So I'm still confused about this.

I created a file `super_coalgebras.py`, modeling it on `super_algebras.py`:

```
class SuperCoalgebras(SuperModulesCategory):

    def extra_super_categories(self):
        return [self.base_category().Graded()]
```
I also modified `coalgebras.py` by removing the `class Super(...)`. But this didn't work: I got

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/categories/super_coalgebras.py", line 44, in sage.categories.super_coalgebras.SuperCoalgebras.extra_super_categories

And of course, if anyone manages to answer these questions, I fully expect to get stuck 5 minutes later on something else. I just don't understand enough of the category framework to do this in anything approaching an efficient way.

Well, the `dual` there is the for the dual category, which is some category theoretical thing that I don't know about. Anything defined in `ParentMethods` becomes a method for any `Parent` object in that category (e.g., an exterior algebra). I misread your previous post; so yes, I agree that what you have above should be `True`.

Did you add a redirect from coalgebras to the super version? Coalgebras still needs to know what class its super version is. (See, e.g., `ModulesWithBasis`.)

I will take over then and try to get this to a workable state.

So as long as the new functorial construction is well documented and easy to apply in these non-supercommutative cases, okay.

That is the plan. It might take a few iterations (on trac) to get something that works in all the case you want, so please bear with me.

> Perhaps also implement `SuperCocommutativeCoalgebras`? It would be nice to say that the Steenrod algebra is super cocommutative, and that therefore it gets the sign on the tensor product, even though the product is not commutative.

That should be no trouble to do as well. Actually, we currently do not even have a cocommutative axiom. It might be better to introduce these on a separate ticket.

(Frédéric, Mike, and Darij will you be there? Perhaps we can do some work there too.) I am doing workshop after conference until then, so I cannot do it before then unfortunately.

Whatever we do, we need to document it very well, because I think that different people use "graded Hopf algebra" (for example) to mean different things. In algebraic topology, it includes the sign in the tensor product, and I am deducing that this is not the case in combinatorics, right?

I would also point out that so far in Sage, "super" just means Z/2-graded (from what I see in a few docstrings), and therefore any "super blah" should also be a "blah" and a "graded blah".

Actually, given the conflict in what "graded Hopf algebra" means to different mathematicians, my inclination would be to avoid the phrase altogether, and instead have something like "Hopf algebra with grading" for the combinatorial version, and I'm not sure what for the algebraic topology version.

Thanks very much for working on this! I see one doctest failure with Python 2 (easy to fix):

```
File "src/sage/categories/with_realizations.py", line 262, in sage.categories.with_realizations.WithRealizations
Failed example:
    C.super_categories()
Expected:
    [Join of Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field
         and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field]
Got:
    [Join of Category of hopf algebras over Rational Field and Category of graded algebras over Rational Field and Category of graded coalgebras over Rational Field]
```
I see a few more with Python 3:

```

(I haven't actually run the full test suite, just tests in `algebras` and `categories`.)

I'll be working my way through the code.

I think this looks good, but I'm going to keep banging away at it for a few days.

A few questions:
- This is probably overkill, but in characteristic 2, would it make sense to automatically convert super -> graded (over Z/2), since there are no signs involved? Probably not worth it, but in characteristic 2, exterior algebras are honest Hopf algebras, as is the mod 2 Steenrod algebra.
- Why this asymmetry?

```
sage: AlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).Super().super_categories()
[Category of graded algebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of super algebras over Rational Field,
 Category of super modules with basis over Rational Field]
sage: CoalgebrasWithBasis(QQ).Super().super_categories()
[Category of super modules with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of coalgebras with basis over Rational Field,
 Category of super coalgebras over Rational Field]
```
 Should "Category of *graded* coalgebras with basis ..." be among the super categories in the second case, rather than just "Category of coalgebras with basis ..."?

The reason why I mentioned those tickets was because the MRO issue reminded me of them, but that seems to be a red herring. Curious...

The "Supercommutative" and "Supercocommutative" axioms imply "Super" Hopf algebra, so is this necessary?

Maybe a graded object should have a method or attribute `grading_group` (or whatever you want to call it). I'm not sure how else you would convey this information, because `GradedSuperHopfAlgebras...` is redundant: super implies graded, and "graded" should make no assumptions about what the grading group is. You could have `GradedConnectedSuperHopfAlgebras...` because graded + connected implies a Z-grading (at least to me: it doesn't mean "connected as a Hopf algebra" + "graded as a (super) Hopf algebra").

> (Eventually, gradings will be very useful, as they allow you to do linear algebra when the graded parts are finite-dimensional.)

At least with the Steenrod algebra, there is a method `homogeneous_component` which takes a degree as input and returns the finite dimensional vector space, with basis, for the component in that degree.

I tried deleting this and got a few doctest failures:

I like the output from those doctests, so I wouldn't want to just delete the class and modify the doctests.

I agree that this would be a good idea.

As John said, the implication is already there. So adding `Super` to the first category is overkill.

I'm not sure how else you would convey this information, because `GradedSuperHopfAlgebras...` is redundant: super implies graded, and "graded" should make no assumptions about what the grading group is. You could have `GradedConnectedSuperHopfAlgebras...` because graded + connected implies a Z-grading (at least to me: it doesn't mean "connected as a Hopf algebra" + "graded as a (super) Hopf algebra").

Super implies graded for modules/algebras/etc. (but not as Hopf algebras). The super stuff is controlled by the `is_even_odd` method that outputs something in **Z**2**Z**. You can have the normal **Z** grading, and as long as whatever grading is naturally compatible with the super grading, you should not have to do anything more.

Yes because we cannot do anything special with them other than mark them at this point. Although we could add a test for cocommutative coalgebras with basis to check that it is cocommutative.

So should supercommutative only be there for algebras? In both cases, it is just a convenience method to shortcut doing `Algebras(QQ).Super().Supercommutative()` and similarly for coalgebras. -1 for removing them.

This already is there and was added as per your request when we first did the super stuff; see `coalgebras.py`. For the commutative, we already are explicitly forbidding commutative to be passed; see `super_modules.py`. So adding more tests of this form is redundant IMO.

As soon as you make something supercommutative, you make it into its super version (which, as you note, is not an axiom (but instead a functorial construction)). It is the same as soon as you create the graded `X` it also knows that it is a filtered `X`.
