Add an option to make elements in QQbar / AA print using radical format:

```
sage: AA(19).sqrt()
4.358898943540674?
sage: QQbar.zeta(6)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I

sage: AA.options.display_format = 'radical'

sage: AA(19).sqrt()
sqrt(19)
sage: QQbar.zeta(6)
1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 1/2
```

Keywords: AlgebraicField, QQbar, AA
