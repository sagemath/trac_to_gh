This is a project to implement an abstraction of rectification, evacuation and promotion. These are conventionally defined on standard tableaux using jeu-de-taquin. The file catalan.py gives a toy implementation. I intend to provide other implementations.

You should just have an abstract base class (ABC) for the `*Tableau` objects (the `ElementMethods` is currently playing this role, but you're using a sledgehammer in place of a ball-peen). It is something that is easy to change back if there becomes a practical use/need for the category, but I think it puts more distance between the concrete class and the ABC code, which makes it harder to maintain.

Some other misc comments:

- What is this doing here: `#!/usr/bin/env python2`?
- I would call the method `plot` instead of `draw`.
- Your `drawL` and `drawC` might be best as separate standalone functions in the ABC file. Otherwise if you feel that they should be methods, then make them hidden by calling them `_drawL` and `_drawC`.
- I don't see the point of having `draw_partition` in `drawL` as an internal helper function (in `drawC`, it makes sense because of the two `for` loops and avoiding code duplication).
- There are a bunch of malformatted docstrings (`EXAMPLES:` -> `EXAMPLES::` (or missing altogether) when followed by code, which should be indented by 1), and some that should be at the class level or at the top of the module.
- The copyright should be comments, not part of the docstring.

"At this point, I am thinking it might be best to make a new folder in the combinat folder called tableau with your new code (one file for the ABC and your other two files). Then it will become the eventual home for all tableau files (but moving those should be done on separate tickets)."

Could you please expand on this? I understand your suggestion to use an ABC instead of a category.
I am not clear on how this should be done within the trac system.
I understand that I could open a new ticket, copy the files by hand,
and at some point delete the existing ticket. However I suspect you may mean a different approach.

Is the first step to create a new ticket with the new folder called tableau containing just one
file with the ABC?

I understand this to mean my code could construct the wrong graph but this test would not notice
if it happened to have the same adjacency matrix. Really? or did you mean something else?
> I don't see why you have a `PathTableaux` class. It look like it is a very malformed parent.

Could you please expand on this? I take malformed to be pejorative. I will want these to be (finite) enumerated sets but I haven't thought this through yet.

Is there any code for #25173 (apart from `sl3webs.sage`? or is it a "wish list"?

I will refer to our joint paper in the relevant implementations. At the moment I am concentrating

sage: t = CatalanTableau([0,1,2,3,2,1,0])

These are `PathTableau`, so either you implement methods directly there or you explicitly convert.

Travis has hopefully covered all the bases in terms of the programming technicalities (and should probably confirm before this gets a final positive review), I'll focus more on doc/usability.

Some of my previous comments from oscillating tableau actually apply to this ticket (I didn't realize this ticket was being pulled into oscillating tableau ticket as a dependency).

* Adding the underscores to the folder/file names requires a few other lines to be changed. In `src/doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst`, the line `sage/combinat/pathtableau/catalan` needs to be updated to `sage/combinat/path_tableau/catalan`.

Finally, in CatalanTableaux, the link `:class:`sage.combinat.pathtableau.pathtableaux`` needs to be updated to `:class:`sage.combinat.path_tableau.path_tableaux``.

* As with OscillatingTableaux, the docstrings for CatalanTableaux need to be moved from _classcall_private_ up to the class itself.

* `descents` method needs some sort of definition, because in particular, whatever definition is used here doesn't agree with my first idea of what it should be (i appearing in a row below i+1 in the associated two row tableau.

* `to_perfect_matching` should first check to see if the tableau is skew, and give an appropriate error message (rather than having the call to DyckWord fail). Furthermore, if you input something that doesn't end at 0 (corresponding to a two-row tableau with uneven rows), the code still returns a perfect matching, and I'm not sure this is desired behavior.

* I would modify `to_tableau` some, because it should be possible to have this return a StandardTableau in the case where you start with 0 and aren't actually skew. I would have the default behavior check `is_skew`, and then use the appropriate constructor. I suppose there could be situations where you always want your output to use the SkewTableau constructor, so there could be some optional parameter like skew=False that you could set to be True if you always wanted to use the SkewTableau constructor.


* PathTableaux needs some kind of general definition of what path tableaux actually are. It should appear both with the current description of what it's trying to abstract (which should appear at the top of the documentation page for the module), and also for the PathTableau class itself (so it will show up when viewing PathTableau? ).

* Right now, there's just a method to apply the action of a single cactus group generator. It may be useful to have a method that would take a list/sequence of generators and apply them successively.

* The method `commutor` should give some kind of general definition of what the commutor actually is.

<a id='comment:78'></a>`EXAMPLE::` -> `EXAMPLES::` which should also have a blankline after it.

Many methods do not have doctests.

Remove the `CylndricalDiagram.__str__` and change the `__repr__` -> `_repr_`. You should also implement an `_ascii_art_` (and possibly a `_unicode_art_`) and have `pp` call that.

For the `_test_involution`, I would move the `all` out and do an explicit `for` loop that tests each pair (better control of what fails). Also this way you can also use `tester._max_runs` in case `size()` is really big.

`PathTableau` should inherit from `ClonableArray`. IMO your divider comments in that class should be indented to make it easier to read too.

I don't see the point of the `_rule` function in `_local_rule`. Just put that in the `for` loop.

What follows after an `INPUT:` block should *not* be indented.

The docstring for `catalan.py` should be first, not the copyright

<a id='comment:87'></a>Looking at the patchbot report, one sees:

In the first lines of method docs, replace "Returns" by "Return":

```
++        Returns a string representation of ``self``
++        Returns a `\LaTeX` representation of ``self``
++        Returns an ascii art representation of ``self``
++        Returns a unicode art representation of ``self``
```

There is one function missing documentation:

```
+combinat/path_tableaux/path_tableau.py: 95.8% (23 of 24)
```

Moreover, by a quick look at the ticket:

Also, always have an empty line after the first line of the doc of any function or method.

<a id='comment:98'></a>I am inclined to agree with you. It probably would be best as a catalog of the form `path_tableaux.Name` and have that be in the global namespace.

There are also a few places (e.g., in `to_word()`) that need the docstring to being `r"""` (although I would argue you should essentially always do this to be safe). 

There are also a few other places where the docstrings are not formatted for Sage (`cactus` has `$`'s, `PathTableaux` really has a one-line docstring (instead of having the `"""` on their own lines), one-line docstrings should end in a period/full-stop, etc.) However these are very minor things.
