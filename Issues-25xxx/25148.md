An ordered multiset partition C of a multiset X is a list of subsets of X (not multisets),
called the blocks of C, whose multi-union is X.

These objects appear in the work of 
* [Haglund, Rhoades, Wilson] - arXiv:1509.07058
* [Haglund, Rhoades, Shimozono] - arXiv:1609.07575
* [Benkart, et al] - arXiv:1707.08709v2
* [Lauve, Mastnak] - arXiv:1803.02691

This module provides tools for manipulating ordered multiset partitions.

Here is my code, but I have not recently checked it:

```
def multiset_partitions(k,ell,n):
    """
    Return the set of all multiset partitions with `k` parts
    of words of length `ell` on the alphabet `[1,2,...,n]`.

Essentially starting over with this ticket...

In the use of Benkart, et al., it is natural to call e.g.,
`OrderedMultisetPartitions([2,4], 3)` or (resp.) `OrderedMultisetPartitions([2,4], 3, length=2)`
to return the ordered multiset partitions on alphabet {2,4} with 3 total integers used (resp., and with two blocks).

In the use for a forthcoming combinatorial Hopf algebra, it is natural to call, e.g.,
`OrderedMultisetPartitions(4)` to return all ordered multiset partitions whose sum (across all blocks) is 4.

In fact, neither of these make as much sense as as the use
`OrderedMultisetPartitions([1,1,3,4,4,4])` or (resp.) `OrderedMultisetPartitions([1,1,3,4,4,4], length=3)`
to return the ordered multiset partitions of the multiset {{1,1,3,4,4,4}} (resp. into two blocks).

So I have implemented all of these different uses, and added constraints as well, so one can call, e.g.,

```
sage: OrderedMultisetPartitions([2,3,4], 4, max_length=3)
sage: OrderedMultisetPartitions(8, alphabet=[2,4], min_length=3, max_order=4)
```
etc.

I still need to implement the crystal operators from Anne's [comment:7](#comment:7).

I have to say I fell down a rabbit hole and may not have worked my way out of it... 

If somebody could comment on how best to handle constraints to a class (e.g., like `max_length` or `max_block_size` for `SetPartitions`) before I get too much farther, I'd appreciate it.

Hi Aaron,

Perhaps it would help to see how constraints are handled in other classes? See for example `Compositions` or `IntegerVectors`. For example, you can specify various parameters for `IntegerVectors`

```
sage: IntegerVectors(7,2,min_part=2).list()
[[5, 2], [4, 3], [3, 4], [2, 5]]
sage: IntegerVectors(7,min_part=2).list()
[[7], [5, 2], [4, 3], [3, 4], [3, 2, 2], [2, 5], [2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 3]]
```

Best,

Anne

Thanks for the `IntegerVectors` tip, Anne. I had looked at `Compositions` but didn't like how it passed things off to `IntegerListsLex` (and wasn't sure I understood everything happening there).

It looks like wasn't too far off on the basic structure. I should have further by end of weekend.

Anne,
Could you have a look at this branch now? I think the crystal code is in decent shape.

Anybody,
Could you explain why the following two different blocks of code behave differently?

```
      sage: O1 = OrderedMultisetPartitions(weight=[2,1])
      sage: list(O1) # maximum recursion depth exceded
```

```
      sage: O2 = OrderedMultisetPartitions(weight=[2,0,1])
      sage: O2.list()
      [[{1}, {1}, {3}], [{1}, {1,3}], [{1}, {3}, {1}], [{1,3}, {1}], [{3}, {1}, {1}]]
      sage: list(O2)
      [[{1}, {1}, {3}], [{1}, {1,3}], [{1}, {3}, {1}], [{1,3}, {1}], [{3}, {1}, {1}]]
```

I don't know the code well enough, but there is a certain code smell that might well hint at the underlying issue. Here:

```
+        P = OrderedMultisetPartitions(multiset)
```
you're using the duck-typing factory class `OrderedMultisetPartitions`. Are you sure your `multiset` will actually be understood as a multiset?
Similarly, here

```
+            for alpha in Permutations(multiset):
```
you're using `Permutations`; the right class to use here is `Permutations.mset` from `.permutations`.

Also, I have the impression that the `multiset` method on your class leaks mutable internal data (namely, `self._multiset` which, contrary to its name, is a list).

Finally, I think "list of subsets" should be "list of nonempty subsets" everywhere in the doc, or is it not so?

Thanks, Darij

Unfortunately, moving things to `tuples` instead of `lists` did not solve the problem. But I suppose tuples are best, so made this change.

Correct (and corrected).

This is misleading. The issue is not the added `0` to the weight, but you must call `.list()` first. A better example of the underlying issue is:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.multiset_partition_ordered import *
sage: O = OrderedMultisetPartitions(weight=[2,1])
sage: list(O)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
sage: O.list()
[[{1}, {1,2}], [{1}, {1}, {2}], [{1,2}, {1}], [{1}, {2}, {1}], [{2}, {1}, {1}]]
sage: list(O)
[[{1}, {1,2}], [{1}, {1}, {2}], [{1,2}, {1}], [{1}, {2}, {1}], [{2}, {1}, {1}]]
```
What is happening is that `list` is first making sure that the resulting object is finite by:

1. calling `O.__len__`,
2. which calls `O.cardinality()`,
3. which calls `len(list(O))`,

and hence the infinite recursion. When you call `O.list()`, it caches the list of objects in `O._list` and changes the `cardinality` method to simply call `len(O._list)`. Hence, there is no infinite recursion.

Awesome. Thanks, Travis! Caching... duh. Good to learn the difference between `list(x)` and `x.list()`... so the latter just jumps right into `x.__iter__()` and crosses its fingers?

Regarding the `__eq__` method, I was trying to follow the model in `IntegerVectorsConstraints` inside `integer_vector.py`. 
I don't have a good sense for whether or not all of these

```
        sage: C = OrderedMultisetPartitions(weight=[2,0,1], length=2); repr(C)
        sage: D1 = OrderedMultisetPartitions(weight={1:2, 3:1}, min_length=2, max_length=2)
        sage: D2 = OrderedMultisetPartitions({1:2, 3:1}, min_length=2, max_length=2)
        sage: D3 = OrderedMultisetPartitions(5, weight={1:2, 3:1}, length=2)
        sage: D4 = OrderedMultisetPartitions([1,3], 3, weight={1:2, 3:1}, length=2)

This fixes the `list(O)` issue by letting the category framework take care of the `cardinality`. I added `OrderedMultisetPartition/s` to the global namespace. I also removed an `__eq__` on the parent because they are all subclasses of `UniqueRepresentation`, which means equality is by `id` and should never be changed.

If we store internally as lists of words but display as OMPs, won't this lead to endless bugs and confusion for end-users trying to write elementary code like `list(b)`? 

As it stands, one is best served by storing elements as tableaux (row words, actually) for the `e` and `f` methods, but storing as OMPs (or tuples of tuples) for the `_repr_` and `val` methods.

Which of these two pairs are used more often? The `to_tableau` and `from_tableau` methods seem pretty cheap. So long as we store things as "tuples of tuples" instead of recreating OMPs all over the place, perhaps that's a good enough savings?

As Travis wrote below, you can just take all elements in the crystal as its `module_generators`. The module generators should consist of a set that generates all elements using the `f_i` and `e_i` operators, but in the code the set does not have to be minimal.

Internally the elements of `CrystalOfTableaux` are stored as words, which I believe was what your parenthetical is saying. However, if you want things like `list(b)` to be treated as OMPs, just add an `__iter__` of the element class that does `return iter(self.to_ordered_multiset_partition())`.

Also, some simple doc and an example showing the internal structure can mitigate confusion, but generally I dislike saying anything about the internal structure in public docs. Writing boilerplate functions for a consistent public API is the annoying drawbacks of doing an adapter class, but it does mean it will be quick for its purpose (constructing the crystal).

> Which of these two pairs are used more often? The `to_tableau` and `from_tableau` methods seem pretty cheap. So long as we store things as "tuples of tuples" instead of recreating OMPs all over the place, perhaps that's a good enough savings?

Compared to the crystal operations themselves, they look very expensive (also considering they are implemented in Python). A good way to actually see what works is to do timings. Compare with `crystals.Tableaux`, `crystals.LSPaths`, and `crystals.NakajimaMonomials`.

```
sage: def test_iteration(B):
....:     for b in B:
....:         pass

sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['A',4], shape=[5,3,3,1])
sage: T.cardinality()
1890
sage: %timeit test_iteration(T)
10 loops, best of 3: 75.6 ms per loop

sage: La = RootSystem(['A',4]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: L = crystals.LSPaths(La[4]+2*La[3]+2*La[1])
sage: %timeit test_iteration(L)
1 loop, best of 3: 2.16 s per loop

sage: La = RootSystem(['A',4]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weights()
sage: M = crystals.NakajimaMonomials(La[4]+2*La[3]+2*La[1])

(I really need to get my fast LS path code into Sage...)

I personally think internally you can use whatever is easiest or fastest for the elements. But for the user all elements should be OMPs.

I think there is some bug in the crystal code though since cardinality does not work:

I am not sure what you mean by "deprecation warnings" in this context. That is usually what happens when you remove a functionality in sage. You could just import CrystalOfLetters in the method where you use it instead of for the whole file.

Working on documentation today... 

Looking through diagram_algebras.py, I notice a few anomalies that make me wonder about conventions. 

1/ Regarding references, I see 

```
    REFERENCES:

    - [BH2017]_
```
(with a corresponding entry in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`) 
as well as

```
    REFERENCES:

    .. [Naz96] Maxim Nazarov, Young's Orthogonal Form for Brauer's
       Centralizer Algebra. Journal of Algebra 182 (1996), 664--693.
```


2/ Regarding ":" Sometimes I see

```
        EXAMPLES:
```
(see also the "REFERENCES" in Item 1 above) and sometimes

```
        EXAMPLES::
```


3/ Regarding uses of `TestSuite`. Sometimes it appears within the main docstring for a class, and sometimes within the `__init__` method for a class. Is the latter preferred, and the former used only when `__init__` is not present?

I think both are ok. If the reference is only used locally in the file, you can
put it in the file as in the second option. If the reference appears in multiple
files, I think it is preferable to put them in the reference file.

> 2/ Regarding ":" Sometimes I see

If EXAMPLES is followed by code, then you use EXAMPLES:: followed by indentation.
If it is followed by an explanation, then you use EXAMPLES: without indentation. Then
you use :: after the text and then the code is indented.


> 3/ Regarding uses of `TestSuite`. Sometimes it appears within the main docstring for a class, and sometimes within the `__init__` method for a class. Is the latter preferred, and the former used only when `__init__` is not present?

Again, I think it does not matter. But if you have an `__init__`, it is probably
best to put it there.

Could you indicate in the crystal code, that you got the initial draft from me?

Thank you!

Anne

Afer the above changes, I think this file is ready for review.

Quick things:

- Not all (which includes private and special) methods have doc(tests).
- Functions with latex in the doc should start `r"""` (for raw-string, so `\` does not become an escape character, i.e., `\t` in non-raw becomes a tab).
- There is no sorting between integers and strings (in Python3, this is now an error IIRC), which causes this test to fail on the patchbot (even though it might [sometimes] pass on your computer):

  ```
  sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/multiset_partition_ordered.py
  **********************************************************************
  File "src/sage/combinat/multiset_partition_ordered.py", line 649, in sage.combinat.multiset_partition_ordered.OrderedMultisetPartition.finer
  Failed example:
      o.finer()
  Expected:
      {[{'b'}, {'a'}, {1}, {1}], [{'a'}, {'b'}, {1}, {1}], [{'a','b'}, {1}, {1}]}
  Got:
      {[{1}, {1}, {'a'}, {'b'}], [{1}, {'a'}, {1}, {'b'}], [{1}, {1,'a'}, {'b'}]}
  ```
- Need a blank line here (and some punctuation):

  ```diff
           2. If blocks `B_{i+1}, \ldots, B_k` have been converted to words
              `W_{i+1}, \ldots, W_k`, use the letters in `B_i` to make the unique
              word `W_i` that has a factorization `W_i=(u,v)` satisfying:
  +
              - letters of `u` and `v` appear in increasing order, with `v` possibly empty
              - letters in `vu` appear in increasing order
              - ``v[-1]`` is the largest letter `a \in B_i` satisfying ``a <= W_{i+1}[0]``
  ```
  Similar for the `.. NOTE::` block in the crystal element class.
- References should also have 4 number years (and IMO, I prefer them to be in the master ref file, helps reduce the risk of duplicate references).
- You should not raise an `AssertionError` (these are only for real bugs, not bad input).
- `if hasattr(x, "value"):` is not a good check. In fact, the coercion framework makes it so that `_element_constructor_` is never called when doing `P(x)` if the parent of `x` is `P`. Thus, you can simply remove this.
- For your `MinimajCrystal.__contains__`, a better check would be `isinstance(x, Element)`.
- It should be `.. NOTE::`, not `.. NOTES:` and what follows should be indented.
- IMO, I would add an `AUTHORS:` block to `MinimajCrystal` saying something like

  ```
  AUTHORS:
  
  - Anne Schilling: initial draft
  - Aaron Lauve: changed to use `ElementWrapper`
  ```
- I still think you should use the `CrystalOfTableaux` code rather than manually working with a tensor product of letters as it is essentially code duplication.
- <code>\`ZZ\`</code> -> <code>\`\ZZ\`</code>
- In terms of speed, it is much better to use Python's `frozenset` instead of Sage's `Set`.

I will probably have some more comments later.

Travis,

I finished implementing most of your suggested changes (plus an additional one). 

I'm not quite sure what to do about your `CrystalsOfTableaux` suggestion:

* the elements are not individual instances `crystals.Tableaux(['A', n-1], shape=??)` but rather tensor products of these (so what code are we duplicating?)
* the constituent shapes ("??" above) are not easily predetermined and are not uniform across all ordered multiset partitions of order d and length k

I have left that bit of code alone for now.

<div id="comment:87" align="right">comment:87</div>

I think I should remove the user shorthand for `OrderedMultisetPartition` that uses `OrderedMultisetPartitions.from_list()`.

While the shorthand is nice for `OrderedMultisetPartition`, I don't see how to make it play nicely with the `__getitem__()` method for combinatorial free modules over `OrderedMultisetPartitions`.

E.g., in the present state of ticket #25543, these come in correctly:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.chas.omp_hopf_algebras import HopfAlgebraOnOrderedMultisetPartitions
sage: H = HopfAlgebraOnOrderedMultisetPartitions(QQ).H()
sage: H[[1,2],[1,3]]
H[{1,2}, {1,3}]
sage: H[[[1,2],[1,3]]]
H[{1,2}, {1,3}]
```
But this one is problematic (there are two possible intended OMPs):

```
sage: H[[1,2]]
```
Should it be `H(OrderedMultisetPartition([This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)))` or should it be `H(OrderedMultisetPartition([1,2]))`

**NOTE:** A similar shorthand confusion happens for WQSym (e.g., tickets  #25133, #25151). There, I'd say the problem is even more serious due to the "words" option that we have allowed for that Hopf algebra. Indeed, perhaps this "bug" even merits a new ticket:

```
sage: M = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ).M()
sage: x = M[[1,3],[2]]; x
M[{1, 3}, {2}]
sage: M.options.objects = "words"
sage: x
M[1, 2, 1]
sage: M[OrderedSetPartition([1,2,1])]
M[1, 2, 1]
sage: M[1,2,1]
M[1, 1]
sage: M[[1,2,1]]
M[1, 1]
```

because it conflicts with the `__getitem__` method when using `OrderedMultisetPartitions` as index set for combinatorial free modules.

Hi Aaron,

Overall, the code looks pretty good. Here are some suggestions from the user point of view:

- If the user inputs the wrong data structure, it might be a good idea to give a more informative error message saying what went wrong

```
sage: p=OrderedMultisetPartition([[5, 3], [1, 3, 3]])
...
/Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/cpython/getattr.pyx in sage.cpython.getattr.getattr_from_other_class (build/cythonized/sage/cpython/getattr.c:2468)()
    387         dummy_error_message.cls = type(self)
    388         dummy_error_message.name = name
--> 389         raise AttributeError(dummy_error_message)
    390     cdef PyObject* attr = instance_getattr(cls, name)
    391     if attr is NULL:

AttributeError: 'OrderedMultisetPartitions_X_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute '_n'
```

- I am not sure one should keep the input with 0's option. For example, the user could do something strange like

```
sage: P=OrderedMultisetPartitions([0,0,1])
sage: P.from_list([1,0,0,0,0])

Based on what Patchbot has said:

I think there are two docstring EXAMPLES that only have one semicolon instead of two.

There are complaints that `shuffle.py` imports but doesn't use Compositions, I think because Compositions is used for an example but not any actual code? Not sure if that's an actual issue or not.

There's some minor Python3 compatibility issues (8 instance of something.iteritems() being used, I think they should all be iteritems(something) now? ).

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

One request:

please avoid `Set` in library code, whenever possible.  Use `set`, it is much faster and more reliable.

For example, if for some stupid reason `alph` happens to be unhashable, the comparison

```
len(Set(alph)) == len(alph))
```
will always yield `True`, without warning.

I would also suggest to return `set`s instead of `Set`s, whenever there is no very good reason to use the latter.

done. no good explanation other than I did an insufficient find-replace.

.

The alphabet should be hashable. I suppose I have not explicitly mentioned that anywhere. I also will say the main reason I didn't use `set` here was out of laziness. Let me know if you are happy with the alternative.

.
> * `_refine_block`: why do you want a set of `Set`s?  Perhaps you want a set of `frozenset`s?

laziness. corrected.

.
> * `_split_block`: same as for `_refine_block`

laziness. corrected.

.
> In general, I think it would be wonderful if the internal representation would be compatible with `SetPartition` after #25462

I believe I have already done this: both are cloneable arrays with data being lists of frozensets. Please elaborate if you mean something different by this comment.

Here are my current comments (more may follow later):

I don't understand why on, e.g., `deconcatenate` you do not simply return a list. You are constructing it in a deterministic way and lists are easier to manipulate and often faster to work with.

Have you compiled and looked at the documentation? I would suspect `minimaj` is ill-formatted.

Same for the `OrderedMultisetPartitions` doc.

The doc for`OrderedMultisetPartitions.__classcall_private__` does not need to list the classes. The code says that.

I think a better way to do `_satisfies_constraints` is to implement a `dict` whose keys are the strings and whose values are the individual tests. This is going to have better lookup times (you don't need to check all of the keys 1 by 1).

You should implement `_an_element_` (so `an_element` is cached). Although I thought the category provided the same one as yours by default?

```diff
-        - ``size`` -- an integer representing a slice of all ordered
-                      multiset partitions.
+        - ``size`` -- an integer representing a slice of all ordered
+          multiset partitions
```

You can kill tests `C == loads(dumps(C))` as the `TestSuite` checks this.

In `prod`, you do not need to pass a list.

Instead of iterating over all `Compositions(n)`, you can use `omposition_iterator_fast(n)`.

The `def partspoly_coeff(d): return partspoly[d][0]` seems useless. Just put in the return value.

I would make `_iterator_*` return objects that are not actual elements, but lists of frozensets. That way they can be used elsewhere without having to unwrap your elements (which has resulted in large speedups in other code).

There already is a `partial_sums` method in `composition.py` and in `abstract_word.py`. This actually is abstracted in the (cython) function `running_total` in `misc/misc_c.pyx`.

I think `to_tableau` should actually output a `(SemiStandard)Tableau` (or an element of the corresponding crystal).

Anne, can you describe succinctly how to build a list of (skew)tableaux from the list of words that `.to_tableau` produces?
Travis, internally this is used as a list of lists, so packing and unpacking as a list of skew tableaux is a bit of a waste. Do you recommend separately making a private method
`._to_tableau_words` that produces what we currently produce with `.to_tableau`?

I disagree with Travis. The output (mathematically) is really a tuple of column tableaux and a ribbon tableaux. So the output should definitely not be a semistandard tableau. We could just make these methods private as Aaron suggests. Or give the method a different name, such as `to_word_of_tableaux_representation` or something like that.

Speaking of "different name," I would like to broach the subject of the name for these objects.

To me, a partition (ordered or not) is a decomposition of some gadget into like gadgets. So, a partition of `{{1,1,1,2,2}}` might look like `{{1,2}},  {{1,1}},  {{2}}`. And an **ordered multiset partition** would then look like this (dropping the braces),

`(11, 2, 12)`.

Here, we further demand that the blocks have distinct entries. I might call our present gadgets **__strict__ ordered multiset partitions**, or **ordered partition of a multiset __into sets__**. That's a mouthful, but a certain person (Mike Z) has come across the need to code honest ordered multiset partitions (as I've defined them in the previous paragraph).

I propose to change `OrderedMultisetPartition` to `OrderedMultisetPartition_Strict` and graciously accept alternative suggestions.

```json
{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nThere is still work to be done. Some of my bigger changes:\n\n- Anything passed into an `Element` should have a `parent` as the first argument. I have made it a hard error if that does not happen.\n- No need to have an `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_all_constraints.__init__` as it is the same as for the base class.\n- The `TestSuite(X).run()` checks `loads(dumps(X)) == X`, so I removed these tests.\n\nSome comments:\n\nThe parent names with `X` and `A` are not descriptive enough IMO. Also, some of your classes have the input parameters in their names, but not all, e.g., `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_A` does not also include the fixed order `d`. I think the `X` is fine, but I would replace `A` with `alphabet`.\n\nThe doc for `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets` will still need some improvements. I don't like the overall formatting with bullet points for the examples. I think paragraph breaks are sufficient, but if you want something more, I would go with `.. RUBRIC::`.

There is still work to be done. Some of my bigger changes:

- Anything passed into an `Element` should have a `parent` as the first argument. I have made it a hard error if that does not happen.
- No need to have an `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_all_constraints.__init__` as it is the same as for the base class.
- The `TestSuite(X).run()` checks `loads(dumps(X)) == X`, so I removed these tests.

Some comments:

The parent names with `X` and `A` are not descriptive enough IMO. Also, some of your classes have the input parameters in their names, but not all, e.g., `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_A` does not also include the fixed order `d`. I think the `X` is fine, but I would replace `A` with `alphabet`.

The doc for `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets` will still need some improvements. I don't like the overall formatting with bullet points for the examples. I think paragraph breaks are sufficient, but if you want something more, I would go with `.. RUBRIC::`. (Also, try to keep the prose under 80 chars/line.)

Your `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets.__classcall_private__` is somewhat of a mess. For instance, if you passed in things as only keyword input, you would get the generic class, which is a bug:

```
sage: OMP = OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets(alphabet=['A','B'], order=2)
sage: list(OMP)
[[{'A','B'}], [{'A'}, {'A'}], [{'A'}, {'B'}], [{'B'}, {'A'}], [{'B'}, {'B'}]]
sage: OMP
Ordered Multiset Partitions with constraints: alphabet={'A', 'B'}, order=2
sage: type(OMP)
<class 'sage.combinat.multiset_partition_ordered.OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_all_constraints_with_category'>
sage: OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets(['A','B'], 2)
Ordered Multiset Partitions of order 2 over alphabet {A, B}
```
Additionally I generally believe errors should be raised when inputs are incompatible rather than silently ignoring them. I understand this may not be possible for usable code, but it is something to strive for.

```
sage: OMP = OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets(weight=[1,2],alphabet=['a','b'],order=2); OMP
Ordered Multiset Partitions with constraint: weight={1: 1, 2: 2}
sage: type(OMP)
<class 'sage.combinat.multiset_partition_ordered.OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_all_constraints_with_category'>
sage: list(OMP)
[[{1}, {2}, {2}], [{1,2}, {2}], [{2}, {1}, {2}], [{2}, {1,2}], [{2}, {2}, {1}]]
```

Something to note: the `random_element` is not uniform:

```
sage: OMP = OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets([1,4], 3)
sage: d = {}
sage: for _ in range(6000):
....:     x = OMP.random_element()
....:     if x in d:
....:         d[x] += 1
....:     else:
....:         d[x] = 1
sage: d.values()
[238, 251, 1040, 287, 273, 250, 1005, 991, 213, 243, 249, 960]
```

```
sage: OMP = OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets([1,1,3])
sage: d = {}
sage: for _ in range(5000):
....:     x = OMP.random_element()
....:     if x in d:
....:         d[x] += 1
....:     else:
....:         d[x] = 1
sage: d.values()
[3363, 1637]
sage: len(OMP)
5
```
In fact, the latter one for `OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets_X` is cause for concern because it does even generate every element. The one for `OrderedMultisetPartitionIntoSets_n` is uniform, except it does not cover all elements:

```
sage: OMP = OrderedMultisetPartitionsIntoSets(5)
sage: d = {}
sage: for _ in range(5000):
....:     x = OMP.random_element()
....:     if x in d:
....:         d[x] += 1
....:     else:
....:         d[x] = 1
sage: d.values()
[312, 324, 302, 308, 340, 332, 316, 338,
 267, 320, 297, 315, 294, 283, 321, 331]
sage: len(d)
16
sage: len(OMP)
25
```

`to/from_tableau` is a bad name. To begin with, if anything it should be plural `to/from_tableaux`. Second, each individual part of the list of `to_tableau` is not formatted as a tableau (I am guessing we are suppose to consider it as a reading word). Again, it also does not output any of Sage's tableau objects. Without saying more information about the output in the method documentation, it is not so useful to work with for the uninitiated.

Thank you for the detailed comments (and for the commit preceding it; my apologies for the mess I left you).
 I addressed all of them in the latest commit, except the first one and last one:

* I'm not sold on the idea of replacing `_A` with `_alphabet` as things start to get a little long. I modeled the names off of `set_partition_ordered.py`, but I'm happy to come up with something different if you keep pushing.

* I didn't touch `\varphi`... I leave this one for Anne to weigh-in on.
