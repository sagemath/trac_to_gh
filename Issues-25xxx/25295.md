I have added a bunch of "`k` combinatorial things" to sage (things that Jennifer Morse is asking me for).  It already exists https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage as a library, but I am now trying to migrate the code into core sage itself.

Since the library is large, I am breaking up the changes into separate tickets that can be dealt with one at a time.  They are in proper dependency order:

1. partition: #25931
2. skew_partition: #26293
3. k_shape: #26303
4. root_ideal: no ticket yet
5. strong_marked_tableau: no ticket yet

Thanks, Travis!  I'm going to pursue this ticket a lot less aggressively while the code is still being written.  George has suggested that it may be easier to wait until the code has been completed, and then see which parts of the code turn out to be useful, and then migrate that into Sage.

For now, anyone is welcome to use the code here:

Travis,

I am currently stuck on this issue https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42732/codomain-could-not-be-determined/ and sorely in need of help :(  Can you offer any advice?

Unfortunately I couldn't make it because I was sick :(  My name is Matthew Lancellotti and I'm building this code for Jennifer Morse.  Jennifer speaks well of you!  Feel free to contact me here, through github, or at ml9nn at virginia dot edu at any time.  Have a nice day!
