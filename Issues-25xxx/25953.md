Code looks good to me, also built the html doc and it looks good (though I realized other doc doesn't properly link to order_ideal_toggle and order_ideal_toggles since they live in different files...but that's a separate ticket).

I'm wondering whether this need to be its own function, or if it might be better to have an optional ``plot=False'' parameter for the rowmotion_orbits() and toggling_orbits() function.

A second thing to consider would be making a more robust and general `orbits()` type method where you input a set and a bijective action, and it will generate the orbits, and additionally have an optional plot parameter which would create the graphics array. But that might be a future ticket.

I think it is better (in this case) that they are separate functions as it is better separation-of-concerns.

> A second thing to consider would be making a more robust and general `orbits()` type method where you input a set and a bijective action, and it will generate the orbits, and additionally have an optional plot parameter which would create the graphics array. But that might be a future ticket.

I think this would be a very good followup ticket (something that is going to be very useful for the general audience). That also can have a `plot` version that abstracts the code in these methods.
