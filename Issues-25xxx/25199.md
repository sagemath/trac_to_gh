```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQbar[]
sage: (1/y).subs({y: 2})
1/y
```

The problem is that the hashes don't match up between the polynomial ring and its fraction field:

```
sage: hash(y) == hash(Frac(R)(y))
False
```

From [src/sage/rings/fraction_field_element.pyx`@`8.1:316-318](../tree/master/src/sage/rings/fraction_field_element.pyx`@`8.1:316-318)

 This function hashes in a special way to ensure that generators of
 a ring `R` and generators of a fraction field of `R` have the same
hash. This enables them to be used as keys interchangeably in a
 dictionary (since ``==`` will claim them equal). This is particularly
 useful for methods like ``subs`` on ``ParentWithGens`` if you are
 passing a dictionary of substitutions.

The reason that it's not working right is that the hashing code in fraction_field_element.pyx assumes that hash(1) == 1, and that's not true in QQbar:

```
sage: hash(QQbar(1))
-3730706066237751940
```

This sounds strange; why should any code assume that `hash(1) == 1`?

Yet the fraction field hashing code does make that assumption.  If we're going to keep it that way, perhaps this assumption needs to be more clearly documented.  QQbar might not be the only place that has problems with this.

There's an existing doctest in `FractionFieldElement`'s `__hash__` method (lines 360-364 in Sage 8.4) that checks similar behavior:


```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: hash(R.0)==hash(FractionField(R).0)
True
sage: ((x+1)/(x^2+1)).subs({x:1})
1
```

However, this test is over `QQ`, not `QQbar`, and I've verified that it passed on Sage 7.5.1, while the test in the description of this ticket did not.

So, I suggest adding an additional test over `QQbar` below the existing one in `FractionFieldElement` `__hash__`.

I switched this ticket to a new branch with just that doctest on it.
