The problem is explained by the following example:

```
sage: G = GU(3,2); G
General Unitary Group of degree 3 over Finite Field in a of size 2^2
sage: 
sage: MG = G.as_matrix_group(); MG
Matrix group over Finite Field in a of size 2^2 with 2 generators (
[a 0 0]  [a 1 1]
[0 1 0]  [1 1 0]
[0 0 a], [1 0 0]
)
sage: PG = MG.as_permutation_group(); PG
Permutation Group with generators [(2,3,5)(4,7,12)(6,10,18)(8,14,21)(9,16,22)(11,20,29)(13,23,33)(17,27,26)(19,28,34)(24,25,31)(30,36,35), (1,2,4,8,15,25,12,22,32,27,7,13)(3,6,11,21,31,36,18,16,26,20,30,33)(5,9,17,14,24,23)(10,19,29,28,35,34)]
sage: 
sage: mg = MG.an_element(); mg
[a + 1     a     a]
[    1     1     0]
[    a     0     0]
sage: conv_ori = PG.convert_map_from(MG); conv_ori
Call morphism:
  From: Matrix group over Finite Field in a of size 2^2 with 2 generators (
[a 0 0]  [a 1 1]
[0 1 0]  [1 1 0]
[0 0 a], [1 0 0]
)

sage: 
sage: img_mg = conv_ori(mg)

    259 
    260     return g

TypeError: 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.group_element.MatrixGroupElement_gap' object is not iterable
```

Remark: another (independent) problem is that the conversion can not be applied by instance call

Hi Travis,

thanks for fixing this! Was it my fault? Did I have a chance to detect it by myself?

This week in Saragossa had been a very nice experience to me! I learned a lot (but need to learn much more, as these questions show) and met a lot of friendly people!

Thanks again, for making this possible to me!

Hmm, why does this branch use `gap`, not `libgap`?

No, in fact MatrixGroup is fine, it's PermutationGroup that needs work. Indeed, instead of that conversion to strings etc one can compute the libGAP group C in `as_permutation_group()` as follows:

```
sage: type(m)
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated.FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap_with_category'>
sage: iso=m._libgap_().IsomorphismPermGroup()
sage: C=iso.Image() # of the following, if you need:
sage: C=iso.Image().SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation()
sage: PG=PermutationGroup(gap_group=gap(C.Image()),  canonicalize=False) # gap() is need, still
```

One way or another, it's much cleaner and faster, and easy to adapt to libgap-converted PermutationGroup. I've opened #26889 for this to be done.

Hi Dima,

FYI: this has been one of my first tickets. I did it with the help of Travis on the SageDays94 in July in Zaragoza. At that time I didn't know much about `libgap`. In the meantime I learned a little bit more since I am trying to move the permutation groups closer to `libgap` (you aleady found the correspondig ticket: #26750).

In that context I had a look at `as_permutation_group` again (a couple of weeks ago), and I tried something similar as you did. I used the option `algorithm` in order not to change the default behavior (I wasn't sure if there is a proper reason for that construction which leads to a different result). But unfortunately, I realized that the new attribute `_permutation_group_morphism` (we had introduced in this ticket) does not keep track on optional arguments of `as_permutation_group`. This made me hesitating to continue that work.

But anyway, since the latter problem obviously is a bug, I opened a ticked about that, now: #26903

By the way: Do you know why the `as_permutation_group` of class `FinitelyPresentedGroup` does not use `IsomorphismPermGroup`?
