The problem is explained by the following example:

```
sage: G = GU(3,2); G
General Unitary Group of degree 3 over Finite Field in a of size 2^2
sage: 
sage: MG = G.as_matrix_group(); MG
Matrix group over Finite Field in a of size 2^2 with 2 generators (
[a 0 0]  [a 1 1]
[0 1 0]  [1 1 0]
[0 0 a], [1 0 0]
)
sage: PG = MG.as_permutation_group(); PG
Permutation Group with generators [(2,3,5)(4,7,12)(6,10,18)(8,14,21)(9,16,22)(11,20,29)(13,23,33)(17,27,26)(19,28,34)(24,25,31)(30,36,35), (1,2,4,8,15,25,12,22,32,27,7,13)(3,6,11,21,31,36,18,16,26,20,30,33)(5,9,17,14,24,23)(10,19,29,28,35,34)]
sage: 
sage: mg = MG.an_element(); mg
[a + 1     a     a]
[    1     1     0]
[    a     0     0]
sage: conv_ori = PG.convert_map_from(MG); conv_ori
Call morphism:
  From: Matrix group over Finite Field in a of size 2^2 with 2 generators (
[a 0 0]  [a 1 1]
[0 1 0]  [1 1 0]
[0 0 a], [1 0 0]
)
  To:   Permutation Group with generators [(2,3,5)(4,7,12)(6,10,18)(8,14,21)(9,16,22)(11,20,29)(13,23,33)(17,27,26)(19,28,34)(24,25,31)(30,36,35), (1,2,4,8,15,25,12,22,32,27,7,13)(3,6,11,21,31,36,18,16,26,20,30,33)(5,9,17,14,24,23)(10,19,29,28,35,34)]
sage: 
sage: img_mg = conv_ori(mg)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

--> 258             g = [tuple([convert_dict[x] for x in cycle])for cycle in g]
    259 
    260     return g

TypeError: 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.group_element.MatrixGroupElement_gap' object is not iterable
```

Remark: another (independent) problem is that the conversion can not be applied by instance call 

Depends on #24612

Hi Travis,

thanks for fixing this! Was it my fault? Did I have a chance to detect it by myself?

This week in Saragossa had been a very nice experience to me! I learned a lot (but need to learn much more, as these questions show) and met a lot of friendly people!

Thanks again, for making this possible to me!

Hmm, why does this branch use `gap`, not `libgap`?

well, perhaps it's cause supposedly "converted to libgap" MatrixGroup is very far from being fully converted.

No, in fact MatrixGroup is fine, it's PermutationGroup that needs work. Indeed, instead of that conversion to strings etc one can compute the libGAP group C in `as_permutation_group()` as follows:

```
sage: type(m)
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated.FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap_with_category'>
sage: iso=m._libgap_().IsomorphismPermGroup()
sage: C=iso.Image() # of the following, if you need:
sage: C=iso.Image().SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation()
sage: PG=PermutationGroup(gap_group=gap(C.Image()),  canonicalize=False) # gap() is need, still
```

One way or another, it's much cleaner and faster, and easy to adapt to libgap-converted PermutationGroup. I've opened #26889 for this to be done.

Hi Dima,

FYI: this has been one of my first tickets. I did it with the help of Travis on the SageDays94 in July in Zaragoza. At that time I didn't know much about `libgap`. In the meantime I learned a little bit more since I am trying to move the permutation groups closer to `libgap` (you aleady found the correspondig ticket: #26750).

In that context I had a look at `as_permutation_group` again (a couple of weeks ago), and I tried something similar as you did. I used the option `algorithm` in order not to change the default behavior (I wasn't sure if there is a proper reason for that construction which leads to a different result). But unfortunately, I realized that the new attribute `_permutation_group_morphism` (we had introduced in this ticket) does not keep track on optional arguments of `as_permutation_group`. This made me hesitating to continue that work.

But anyway, since the latter problem obviously is a bug, I opened a ticked about that, now: #26903

By the way: Do you know why the `as_permutation_group` of class `FinitelyPresentedGroup` does not use `IsomorphismPermGroup`?
