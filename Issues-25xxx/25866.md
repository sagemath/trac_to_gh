This ticket modifies the method `_simplify` of chart functions on manifolds to permit series expansion of tensor field, scalar field or connection.

Most of the usual operations are already supported (except Lie derivative).

Because the expansion is performed at the lowest level, it provides a major improvement in performances for computing general perturbations (compared with simply expanding after the computation).

A notebook example can be found [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/series/First-order%20example.ipynb).


This is part of the â€‹[SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/); see the metaticket #18528 for an overview.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Thank you very much for having added this new functionality!
The code looks basically good to me. There are some issues with the user interface and documentation though:
- Method `ChartFunction.__init__()`: the new arguments `symbol` and `order` must added in the `INPUT` section of the documentation of `ChartFunction`; besides the name `symbol` is not explicit enough; it should be replaced by something like `expansion_symbol`
- Method `TensorField.set_calc_order()`: no explicit call to that method appears in its doctests!
- Method `TensorFieldParal.series()`: it would help the reader if you add the raw output of this method in the doctests, i.e. add

```
 sage: g.series(e, 3)
[(Field of symmetric bilinear forms on the 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M,
  0),
 (Field of symmetric bilinear forms on the 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M,
  1),
 (Field of symmetric bilinear forms on the 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold M,
  2)]
```
  before displaying the individual elements of the returned list
- In the doctests of the same method and as well as in `truncate()` and `set_calc_order()`, note that you 
  can use 

```
sage: g.set(g+e*h1+e**2*h2)
```
  as a shortcut for

```
sage: g.set_comp()[:] = (g+e*h1+e**2*h2)[:]
```
- Method `PseudoRiemannianMetric.inverse()`: the name `symbol` for the argument that triggers the expansion is not explicit enough: it should be changed to something like `expand_with_respect_to`. 
- Method `ScalarField.set_calc_order()`: the docstring (probably cut-and-pasted from the tensor field one) must be adapted to the scalar field case; in particular *components* has no meaning in the current context; besides *Tell the ...* does not look like a proper phrase for a reference manual...

Done in the above commit. 

A question remains: the argument `order` of the various methods `set_calc_order`, as well as the attribute `_order`, is the order of the big O. As a result, to get an expansion to first order with respect to the parameter `epsilon`, we have to do `g.set_calc_order(epsilon, 2)`. This seems very counter-intuitive and error-prone to me: I would have expected `g.set_calc_order(epsilon, 1)` instead. I understand that the current setting follows the convention of the method `series` of symbolic expressions, while I would prefer that it follows the convention of `taylor`:

```
sage: exp(x).series(x, 2)
1 + 1*x + Order(x^2)
sage: exp(x).taylor(x, 0, 1)
x + 1
```
(Btw, the above looks like a kind of inconsistency in Sage)

What do you think?

In the current context, *calculation degree* sounds awkward to me, contrary to *calculation order*. Speaking about `set_calc_order`, are we sure that this is a good name in the first place? This method is indeed the user interface to indicate that one wants to perform an approximate calculation. Would `set_series_expansion` or `use_series_expansion` or something else be a better name?

<a id='comment:15'></a>Sorry for the long delay in coming back to this!
In the above commits, I have 

- set `order` to be the degree of the polynomial in front of the big O, adding some warnings about this (cf. the discussion in[comment:12](#comment%3A12) and[comment:13](#comment%3A13))
- simplified the output of the method `TensorFieldParal.series()` (there was not need to return a list of pairs with the second element of each pair being merely the index in the list)
- add the arguments `expansion_symbol` and `order` to the method `Chart.function()` for consistency with  the constructor of a chart function
- improved the documentation, in particular regarding the meaning of `order`

Besides I've run some benchmarks to check that the new functionalities added by this ticket, which are essentially implemented in `ChartFunction._simplify()`, do not degrade significantly the tensor calculus performance when no series expansion is required.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I just have some nitpicks that once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I think this will look at little better in the compiled doc:

```diff
-`f_0`, `f_1`, ..., `f_n`
+`f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_n`
```
and similarly for the `T`'s. (Although I am not sure I have actually ever checked this...)

In all of the `.. MATH::` (that are followed by a `where`), you should add a comma to the end of the formulas for grammatical correctness.

I always think of big `O` with the `O` appearing as a math symbol, so I would say it should be formatted as `big `O`` in the doc.

The offending file is `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield_paral.py` and the numbers 2105 and 2243 in the error message correspond to the ending lines of the docstring of the methods `series_expansion` and `set_calc_order` respectively.
