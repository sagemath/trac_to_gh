It seems that packages that are not built on a system because of a configure check are not included in the upstream directory when running `sage --sdist`. This will often include `gcc`, `curl`, `git`, `gfortran` (which is the same tarball as `gcc`).

Seriously, what is wrong with requiring `./configure`? Every autotools package depends on `./configure` before you can do anything. It only takes a few seconds...

configuring yes, but not building!

I just did

```
make distclean && ./configure && ./sage --sdist
```
and it worked.

I didn't even know what `sage --sdist` is supposed to do though.  Is that documented somewhere?

The description of command-line options available from `sage --advanced` (and also in the [reference manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/options.html#command-line-options-for-sage)) says

```
  -sdist              -- build a source distribution of Sage
```
That's the extent of the documentation, I think.
