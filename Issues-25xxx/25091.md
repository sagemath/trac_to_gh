Using Normaliz can compute several things that are currently not interfaced. This ticket implements:

- Integral points generators
- Euclidean volume and volume
- Triangulation
- Hilbert series
- Ehrhart series of compact polyhedron
- Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of compact polyhedron

FOLLOWUP:

- Make ehrhart_polynomial uniform (in the spirit of `.volume()` that can have several engines.
- Move the lattice related methods to `Polyhedra_normaliz_QQ`.

Normaliz can compute Hilbert series of the integral closures of monomial ideals, not of arbitrary monomial ideals. If one wants to apply it: input the monomials as vertices, the polynomial ring as cone (= unit matrix), and put the weights of the indeterminates into the grading.

Example for Normaliz input (integral closure of (x^2, y^2, deg x = 2, deg y =1)

Thank you. But my question was really: Given a monomial ideal **in Sage**, how to compute the Hilbert series of it (or maybe of its integral closure) using normaliz as a backend (not: *in* normaliz).

I.e.:

```
        sage: n=4;m=11;P = PolynomialRing(QQ,n*m,"x"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(n,x)
        sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
        sage: J = P*[m.lm() for m in I.groebner_basis()]
```
and what now? How to use the new interface to normaliz to compute the Hilbert series of (the integral closure of) `J`?

Since I never worked with the integral closure of a monomial ideal: How are the Hilbert series of the ideal and its integral closure related?

My knowledge of the theory lacks in order to give you a satisfactory answer to your questions.

The present ticket allows you to get the Hilbert series *of a rational polyhedron*. Whether this Hilbert series *is* or corresponds to the Hilbert series of a monomial ideal should be clarified. In case they match, then, what I would do in Sage is

1) a function that transfers the data of the monomial ideal to a polyhedron that uses the backend normaliz and compute its hilbert series (a function implemented in this ticket).

2) use PyNormaliz package directly as the normaliz backend of polyhedron is currently doing. This is not really well documented as its usage is currently only in the backend for polyhedron.

For this, the present ticket provides some useful functions to deal with PyNormaliz that builds on #25090.

Okay. Nevertheless, the mentionned ticket does not provide a way to check if they are available or not. Right?

Right?\n\n\nYes, it doesn't. But I guess that's because the author of that ticket thought that the solution is relatively straight forward: When you code in Python, how do you use a package? You do so by importing stuff. Hence, you should test whether the package is available by trying to import something from that package (sooner or later, you will do anyway!), surrounded with a `try: ... except ImportError: ...` clause.\n\nIndeed, in your code, you do `import PyNormaliz`. So, this could be\n\n```\ntry:\n    import PyNormaliz\nexcept ImportError:\n    raise ImportError(\"some meaningful error message, telling the user at least one way to install PyNormaliz\")\n```\n\nFor latte_int, I am not so sure what you do, because I don't see a related import statement in your code. However, in some place of your code, you do use it; you should try and see what happens if latte_int is not available: Will there be an ImportError, or a TypeError, or a ValueError, etc.? Then, instead of `is_package_available`, you could try to use latte_int in a dry run, and if an error occurs, you take it as an answer (namely the answer that latte_int is not available).",

Yes, it doesn't. But I guess that's because the author of that ticket thought that the solution is relatively straight forward: When you code in Python, how do you use a package? You do so by importing stuff. Hence, you should test whether the package is available by trying to import something from that package (sooner or later, you will do anyway!), surrounded with a `try: ... except ImportError: ...` clause.

Indeed, in your code, you do `import PyNormaliz`. So, this could be

```
try:
    import PyNormaliz
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError("some meaningful error message, telling the user at least one way to install PyNormaliz")
```

For latte_int, I am not so sure what you do, because I don't see a related import statement in your code. However, in some place of your code, you do use it; you should try and see what happens if latte_int is not available: Will there be an ImportError, or a TypeError, or a ValueError, etc.? Then, instead of `is_package_available`, you could try to use latte_int in a dry run, and if an error occurs, you take it as an answer (namely the answer that latte_int is not available).

<a id='comment:46'></a>I looked back at this now, and I'm getting a weird result from an example in Normaliz' manual:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1/2,1/2),(1/3,1/3),(1/4,-1/2)],backend='normaliz')
sage: P

From calling PyNormaliz, I get:

```
sage: h = PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_cone, "HilbertSeries")
sage: h

```

So it's not the parsing from PyNormaliz to sage, but rather something weird is happening here. It has been a while since I wrote the code so I am a bit lost in trying to figure out what is going on...

I'll try to do some more searching...

Yes, in the end I want the Ehrhart series, but I was doing both computations to understand their difference again...

> This is an intricate point, but it is inevitable: the grading is defined on the space in which the polyhedron lives, not on the cone over it.  


Yes, agreed. I take this example from p.23 of the Normaliz manual. I thought that HilbertSeries would work out of the box like in the example. That's why I am asking myself what I did wrong.

In the code for hilbert_series, if no grading is given, we canonically give the all 1's grading on the ambient space, and then ask for the HilbertSeries, in which case we get the empty result(!?). (Is that a good choice of canonical grading?)

So, my question would be, how do I get the result from the Normaliz manual?

This issue makes me wonder also if the results in the current examples are actually true (because maybe I am doing something wrong). For example, what would be the expected outputs of for the 3-dimensional 0-1 cube?

Currently it gives me:

```
sage: C = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1]
....: ,[1,1,0],[1,1,1]],backend='normaliz')
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
sage: C.ehrhart_series()
(t^2 + 4*t + 1)/(t^10 - t^9 - t^8 + 2*t^5 - t^2 - t + 1)
sage: C.ehrhart_series().denominator().factor()
(t + 1)^2 * (t - 1)^4 * (t^2 + 1) * (t^2 + t + 1)
sage: C.ehrhart_quasipolynomial()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```

Hilbert series and ehrhart polynomials look fine, but the denominator of the Ehrhart series is not what I would expect. Is that related to the discussion on p.24 of Normaliz' manual?

I would have expected (1-t)^4, so that the degree would be -2 so that when we dilate by a factor two, we see the first interior integer point. Right?

<a id='comment:49'></a>HilbertSeries works out of the box, provided you use the right input type:

**polytope** defines a cone and a grading, and the Hilbert series of the cone under this grading is the Ehrhart series of the polytope that arises as the intersection of the cone and the hyperplane of degree 1 elements. **polytope** is a homogeneous input type.

The inhomogeneous type **vertices**  only defines a polytope P, or in connection with cone a potentially umbounded polyhedron. We can have an grding on the space in which the polytope lives, and then HilbertSeries makes sense.  This Hilbert series is the generating function of the lattice point enumerator of the points **in** P. You can ask Normaliz to compute the Ehrhart series of P if P is bounded. It constructs a cone with a grading behind the scenes and computes the Hilbert series of that cone.

So far, so good.

In your cube example: the vertices are in principle rational vectors. What are your denominators? Does Sage choose them automatically? If so what are they? 

Moreover, it seems to me tat Sage implicitly defines a grading on the space of the polytpe, taking the sum of the coordinates. This explains why you get a Hilbert series and that it is exactly the result shown: 1 point of degree 0, 3 points of degree 1, 3 of degree 2 and 1 of degree 3.

The denominator of the Ehrhart series is for a 3-dimensional polytope that has vertices of degree 4,3,2 qnd 1.

Before I can say more, I must know what happens on the way from Sage input to Normaliz input.

<a id='comment:51'></a>Dear Winfried,

Thanks for your quick reply. This explanation is really good, and probably I should add it to the top to shortly describe how the translation from sage to normaliz is done.

Here is the verbose of the example for the cube, we can see the input given by sage to normaliz.
The current way is to always use inhomogeneous (vertices, cones, and subspaces). Eventually, inhom. equations and inequalities are added.

```
sage: C = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]],backend='normaliz',
....: verbose=True)
# Calling PyNormaliz.NmzCone(**{'subspace': [], 'vertices': [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 'cone': []})
# ----8<---- Equivalent Normaliz input file ----8<----
amb_space 3
subspace 0
vertices 8
 0 0 0 1
 0 0 1 1
 0 1 0 1
 0 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1
 1 0 1 1
 1 1 0 1
 1 1 1 1
cone 0
# ----8<-------------------8<-------------------8<----
```

Once I have this, I compute the hilbert series, **without** giving any grading. In this case, Sage assign the grading [1,...,1] and passes it to normaliz (as you observed) and get:

```
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```

Now, for the Ehrhart series, I get:

```
sage: C.ehrhart_series()
(t^2 + 4*t + 1)/(t^10 - t^9 - t^8 + 2*t^5 - t^2 - t + 1)
```

As you said:

>  It constructs a cone with a grading behind the scenes and computes the Hilbert series of that cone. 


What is the grading in this case?

So there seems to be a difference between the above input and the one you mentioned:

```
amb_space auto
vertices
[[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1]]
EhrhartSeries
```

because they give different output for the Ehrhart series?

Ok. Good to know!

<a id='comment:54'></a>Ok, I think that I have figured out something, that I did not expect.

```
sage: C = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]
....: ],backend='normaliz',verbose=True)
# Calling PyNormaliz.NmzCone(**{'subspace': [], 'vertices': [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 'cone': []})

 1 0 0 1
 1 0 1 1
 1 1 0 1
 1 1 1 1
cone 0
# ----8<-------------------8<-------------------8<----
```

So far I simply created the 0-1-cube using normaliz. Then, I get the normaliz cone and the enclosed data:

```
sage: cone = C._normaliz_cone;cone
<capsule object "Cone" at 0x7fcc880cf210>
sage: data = C._get_nmzcone_data()
```

From there, if I compute the Hilbert Series directly, it will complain, because it does not have a grading:

```
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"HilbertSeries")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
error                                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-26-93c9989a5377> in <module>()
----> 1 PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"HilbertSeries")

error: Could not compute: No grading specified and cannot find one. Cannot compute some requested properties!
```

So far so good. Then, I ask for the Ehrhart series and then, it unlocks the Hilbert series:

```
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"EhrhartSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone,"HilbertSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
```

For now, there is no way to access the difference in the normaliz cone. It is now equipped with a grading in the background, but it seems that we can not extract it:

```
sage: new_C = C.parent().element_class._from_normaliz_cone(parent=C.parent(),normaliz_cone=cone)
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"HilbertSeries")
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
sage: PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"Grading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
error                                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-43-809cb91899e5> in <module>()
----> 1 PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_C._normaliz_cone,"Grading")

error: Could not compute: Grading !
```

But, when creating a whole new cone from the data and adding by hand the grading (which is what is done in `hilbert_series` in sage, we get the enumeration of the lattice points with respect to this grading:

```
sage: C.hilbert_series()
t^3 + 3*t^2 + 3*t + 1
```

This can be reproduced manually as:

```
sage: data['grading'] = [1] * C.ambient_dim()
sage: new_cone = C._make_normaliz_cone(data)
sage: h = PyNormaliz.NmzResult(new_cone, "HilbertSeries");h
[[1L, 3L, 3L, 1L], [], 0L]
```

So, right now, we get two potential output for Hilbert series.

Further, if we actually change the normaliz cone while doing the computation of the Hilbert series (instead of doing it on a distinct cone created on the side), it then breaks the ehrhart series:

```
sage: C._normaliz_cone = new_cone
sage: C.ehrhart_series()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
error                                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-85-0117d93a819f> in <module>()
----> 1 C.ehrhart_series()

/home/jplabbe/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.pyc in ehrhart_series(self, variable)
    636 
    637         cone = self._normaliz_cone
--> 638         e = PyNormaliz.NmzResult(cone, "EhrhartSeries")
    639 
    640         from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import PolynomialRing

error: Some error in the normaliz input data detected: Grading not allowed with Ehrhart series in the inhomogeneous case
```

<a id='comment:58'></a>Ok!!

So I went back to PyNormaliz and had a look at the tutorial mentioned in Appendix E of the normaliz manual:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Normaliz/NormalizJupyter/master

In there, the PyNormaliz output of .hilbert_series is explained. **Importantly**, it seems that the output is different than the one of normaliz(!). This was the source of one of the above problems.

```
[[1L, 4L, 1L], [1L, 1L, 1L, 1L], 0L]
```

As to be interpreted as `t^2+4t+1` divided by `(1-t)(1-t)(1-t)(1-t)` and a `0` shift.

So, it's all good. But it indicates that the code should be more explicit on those output formats... I'll put this on my list of TODO to add on some comments on the pynormaliz side...

Yes, makes sense now. Somehow got it wrong from the beginning. I just commited an update that should cover the mistake. I added several examples coming from normaliz manual to be able to compare.

I still have to smoothen the usage for the user. But now, at least things look like they work and make sense...

<a id='comment:65'></a>Here is a bug, which I think is coming from the PyNormaliz side of things:

```
sage: v = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
sage: cube = Polyhedron(vertices=v,backend='normaliz')
sage: cube._volume_normaliz()
sage: cube._volume_normaliz('induced_lattice')
6
sage: cube._volume_normaliz()
1.0
```

Equivalently:

```
sage: v = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
sage: cube = Polyhedron(vertices=v,backend='normaliz',verbose=True)

<a id='comment:80'></a>I have some comments:

This is a general Python convention we try to follow with the messages, moreover, the error is because the class has the wrong type (you are not expecting it to be implemented at some point, right?):

```diff
-raise NotImplementedError("The backend should be normaliz.")
+raise TypeError("the backend should be normaliz")
```
A similar comment applies elsewhere too. However, the `ImportError` can be the exception to this guide as it is "long".

The `INPUT:` bullet points are not considered to be complete sentences, so they should not end in a period/full-stop.

PEP8:

```diff
-sage: S = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,1],[1,0]],backend='normaliz') # optional - pynormaliz
+sage: S = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,1],[1,0]], backend='normaliz')  # optional - pynormaliz
```
and similar such things.

In `ehrhart_series()`, i think this will look better in latex formatting:

```
-``t^k`` is number of integer lattice points inside the ``k``-th dilation of
+`t^k` is number of integer lattice points inside the `k`-th dilation of
```
Note that `k` and `t` are not input variable names.

So if you want to keep things the way they are, then you can go ahead and set a positive review. Although I would appreciate you changing them (or at least making a uniform convention for all of your added error messages).

```
A function that only calls itself will definitely infinitely recurse. `;)`

Additionally, a couple of little details noted by the patchbot from pyflakes for `backend_normaliz.py`:

In `def _cone_generators(pynormaliz_cone):`, you have

```
return self._nmz_result(pynormaliz_cone, "Generators")
```
In particular, `self` is not been defined in this ``@`staticmethod`.

Do you require the `import PyNormaliz` here in `_nmz_result`:

```
        PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
        import PyNormaliz
        return self._nmz_result(normaliz_cone, property)
```

Hm. Annoying.

I can reproduce this with `--optional=4ti2,bliss,dochtml,e_antic,gfortran,latte_int,lidia,lrslib,memlimit,mpir,ninja_build,python2,sage,topcom`

and all tests pass with `pynormaliz` added. Dammit.
