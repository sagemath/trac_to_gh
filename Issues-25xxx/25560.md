for n in [1..50]:
  r=RootSystem(['A',n])
del r
gc.collect()
T=Counter(str(type(a)) for a in gc.get_objects() if id(a) not in pre)
[t for t in T.iteritems() if 'RootSystem' in t[0]]
```
prints

```
[("<class 'sage.combinat.root_system.root_system.RootSystem'>", 100)]
```
The `as_dual_of` creation parameter ensures a permanent reference is introduced to the dual root system in its `UniqueRepresentation` construction parameter key.

Probably a solution would be to use a `UniqueFactory` instead, which can preprocess its arguments before storing them as a key in a global dict. To be safe, perhaps strip the key down to just integers and strings (that should be quite doable here).
