Discovered by running

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
F=DynamicalSystem([y^2, 2*x^2 - 4*x*y + 2*y^2])
```

but the underlying issue is that change ring is looking for a Morphism, but the coercion is giving a Map.

```
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^2 + 1
sage: f.change_ring(QQ.embeddings(CC)[0])
```
