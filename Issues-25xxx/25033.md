Currently, `monomial_coefficients()` for Lie algebras plays it safe by not doing the computation when it is not known to have a distinguished basis or to be finite dimensional. Specifically, if the Lie algebra has set the `_gens` attribute, then it is considered unsafe (e.g., it is a `LieAlgebraFromAssociative`). However, in the cases it can compute `basis()`, which means we should be able to do `monomial_coefficients()`.
