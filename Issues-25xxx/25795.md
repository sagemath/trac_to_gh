<a id='comment:4'></a>Consider this example for `ProjectiveSpace`

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2000,'x')
sage: H = End(P); L = P.gens(); LL = []
sage: for i in L:

sage: f = H(L); g = H(LL)
```

```
%timeit

False

%timeit
updated__eq__(f,g)
False
CPU time: 0.00 s,  Wall time: 0.00 s
```
For `AffineSpace`:

```
sage: P = AffineSpace(QQ,30000,'x')
sage: H = End(P); L = P.gens(); LL = []
sage: for i in L:
.....    LL.append(i*i)
sage: f = H(L); g = H(LL)
```

```
%timeit
f == g
False
CPU time: 0.07 s,  Wall time: 0.08 s

updated__eq__(f,g)
False
CPU time: 0.00 s,  Wall time: 0.00 s
```

For Affine space order of algorithm is `O(n)` hence much difference cannot be seen (though we increase dimension, but it that case construction of f,g would take lot of time). However in Projective Space due to `O(n^2)` complexity, efficiency can be seen.

These examples aren't of much importance, but anyways it is an optimization :P

So, using the example from comment:5, I get

sage: %timeit f == g
The slowest run took 37.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.4 µs per loop
```
versus your branch

```
sage: %timeit f == g
10000 loops, best of 3: 65.5 µs per loop
