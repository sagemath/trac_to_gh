<a id='comment:3'></a>Well, right.

Every range in this file is either wrapped (list or Set), inside a loop (for) or inside a call (add_vertices) or used as a containment "something in range". The file itself is already using "range" from "six.moves". So the only possible change of behaviour would be in "MuzychukS6Graph". I do not see any specific issue in there.
