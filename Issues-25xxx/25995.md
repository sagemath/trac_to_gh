Update the instructions in the installation guide

- remove outdated information
- mention the cygwin windows binaries
- mention package manager installation: Debian >= 9, Ubuntu >= 18.04, archlinux, Fedora >= 27, ... (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/Distribution)
- get rid of `src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt` and instead move its content in the installation guide in order to have clear OS X explanations (ie what to choose between `tar.gz`, `app.dmg` or `dmg` and do we deal with them).
- quick command line howto (ie `sage` and `sage -n`) and pointers to do the first steps in Sage
- mention Docker
- mention conda
- mention NixOS

Some possibilities
- mention the brew install (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/jdLfIKQ1M18/PVQqJUUqAgAJ)?
- mention the distribution specifics:
  - [Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SageMath)

The only `README.txt` I found is on the sagemath website when going to "Download" and then "Mac OSX". It does not tell anything about the three different format of installation.

Something that I am still not sure about: Should we consistently call this thing Sage or [SageMath](SageMath)? Currently it's still a bit of a mix though I replaced most instances of Sage with SageMathâ¦something that we might want to revert.

Anyway, I don't think we should strive for perfection here. This had already been quite an improvement :)
