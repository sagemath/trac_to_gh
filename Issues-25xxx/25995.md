Update the instructions in the installation guide

- remove outdated information
- mention the cygwin windows binaries
- mention package manager installation: Debian >= 9, Ubuntu >= 18.04, archlinux, Fedora >= 27, ... (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/Distribution)
- get rid of `src/bin/sage-README-osx.txt` and instead move its content in the installation guide in order to have clear OS X explanations (ie what to choose between `tar.gz`, `app.dmg` or `dmg` and do we deal with them).
- quick command line howto (ie `sage` and `sage -n`) and pointers to do the first steps in Sage
- mention Docker
- mention conda
- mention NixOS

Some possibilities
- mention the brew install (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/jdLfIKQ1M18/PVQqJUUqAgAJ)?
- mention the distribution specifics:
  - [Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SageMath)

The only `README.txt` I found is on the sagemath website when going to "Download" and then "Mac OSX". It does not tell anything about the three different format of installation.

Searching the Sage repo on GitHub for "readme":

- search: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/search?q=readme

reveals three files

- [README.md](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/README.md)
- [build/README.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/build/README.txt)
- [src/sage/ext/mac-app/README](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/ext/mac-app/README)

I added a few more things that I know about. I made quite a few minor changes, mostly related to the correct spelling/casing of trademarks and fixed some sentences that I stumbled upon.

Something that I am still not sure about: Should we consistently call this thing Sage or [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath)? Currently it's still a bit of a mix though I replaced most instances of Sage with SageMath…something that we might want to revert.

Anyway, I don't think we should strive for perfection here. This had already been quite an improvement :)

I moved the Linux instructions and updated the fact that you absolutely need the documentation (otherwise `?` is just broken).

I think this is in good enough shape for now. What do you think?

In the future we might want to update instructions for optional packages (Arch Linux provide some with `pacman` and `pip install` does work).
