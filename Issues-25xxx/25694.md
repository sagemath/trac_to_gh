Along with a little bit of PEP-8 cleanup as well.

I don't believe the substance of any of these tests are changed (there was one case where an old-style class was updated to be a new-style class, but all that matters for the test is that it be an arbitrary object that can be weak-referenced).

<a id='comment:10'></a>Almost a positive review, the very last modification i checked failed in py3 :

```
File "src/sage/structure/unique_representation.py", line 1244, in sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation
Failed example:
    isinstance(GF(7), GF)  # py3
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of
    classes and types
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 650, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1061, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)

        isinstance(GF(Integer(7)), GF)  # py3
    TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types
```

Note that your #py2 and #py3 cases expected the same results right now :

```

         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types
