I'm a bit worried because this will break some of the doctests

```
            sage: len(set([f, f]))
            1
            sage: len(set([f, f+0]))
            2
            sage: len(set([f, f+1]))
            2
```
so it's not just a harmless change, it actually changes functionality.

To be honest, I don't know how to fix that. So maybe we should just live with it. In that case, we should at least *document* it though.

Well, the way this class uses richcmp makes comparison fundamentally broken.

The reason that the `set()` tests still pass is because hashing is by id. So that's actually a good thing because the bogus `__richcmp__` is then not an obstruction for using linear functions as dict key.

So I agree with this ticket, provided that some docs and comments are updated. I'll do that myself.
