This is at the moment a ticket for a nonexisting defect, as no standard package uses C++17 code at the moment.

The compiler situation is that C++17 is fully supported by `clang++-4 --std=c++17` and `g++-7 --std=c++17`. So, compiler-wise Sage could support it without raising requirements (currently at g++-4.8) by building g++ if system has g++<7. But for full support `libstdc++-gcc7` or `libc++-4` is needed too, so `g++-7` would be the system requirement.

How much is gcc-7 already in the wild?

Another issue is that with g++-5 I think and clang++-4 the `register` keyword became deprecated and will be removed with C++17 where it will cause a compiler error. This affects at least Singular and Giac.

Resolution: wontfix
