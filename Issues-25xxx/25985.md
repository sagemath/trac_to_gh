```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(graphs.CycleGraph(6))
sage: B.project_left().vertices()
[0, 2, 4]
sage: B.project_right().vertices()
[0, 2, 4]
```

The code for project_left() and project_right() appears to be identical.

There's a discussion to be had about the best way to rewrite this so code gets reused appropriately, but it may be a little late for that.

Other issues that need tickets (I'm writing them here so I don't forget): vertex_cover() fails because it tries to add edges on the same side of a partition, and specifying the partition in the constructor seems to confuse left and right sometimes.
