I found several problems with complex interval arithmetic:

1. It seems that it takes the dilog of the midpoint and then converts it back to intervals:

```
sage: dilog(CIF(RIF(4,4.1),RIF(4,4.1)))
-0.51510330456949305? + 4.2437340770848096?*I
```

2. It doesn't return intervals:

```
sage: arccosh(CIF(RIF(4,4.1),RIF(4,4.1)))
2.43852473711003 + 0.793017478264382*I

```

3. Hangs:

```
sage: 1 / CIF(RIF(-1,1),RIF(0))

```

1 should either return the right result or fail. 2 doesn't seem to bad until one does the following which seems like valid code and returns an interval, so the user thinks everything is ok:

```
sage: arccosh(CIF(RIF(4,4.1),RIF(4,4.1))).real() + RIF(3.4)
5.8385247371100296?
```


*A note in general:* I do like the availability of interval arithmetic in sage a lot, but I think that sage should be conservative and never ever implicitly convert or coerce an interval to a floating point number. The only way to get a floating point number from an interval is by explicitly calling **.lower()**, **.upper()**, **.center()** (and related such as **endpoints()**)! In particular, operations such as adding an interval to a floating point number shouldn't be allowed - and adding to something exact like an integer or rational should return a valid interval.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The first one is also a problem with real intervals:

```
sage: dilog(RIF(4,4.1))
2.0475591955473647? - 4.3941986780846492?*I
sage: dilog(4.05)
2.04755919558654 - 4.39419867817374*I
```

The other two things work OK for real intervals:

```
sage: arccosh(RIF(4,4.1))
2.1?
sage: 1/RIF(-1, 1)
[-infinity .. +infinity]
```

And some more:

```
sage: atan2(RIF(-1,1),RIF(-1))
3.141592653589794?
```

I also find this behavior

```
sage: atan2(RIF(1),RIF(1))
1/4*pi
```
troublesome because now the type of the result is dependent on the input values.
