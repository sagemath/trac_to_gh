The Hopf algebra `WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions`, despite it's name, is indexed internally as ordered set partitions. This ticket aims to allow the user to also use packed words as input.

I am not happy with the current (development branch) situation, but also not happy with this branch... worrying about end-user getting unexpected results from misuse of `.monomial`, `.sum_of_terms`, etc.

For instance, if users see packed words in their output (e.g., `M[1,1,2,1]`) and also are allowed to write `M[1,1,2,1]` as input, they will be inclined to write code like this:

```
out = M.zero()
for w in PackedWords(4):
    M.sum_of_terms((v,1) for v in w. right_weak_order_greater())
```
This may only cause confusion once per user, but I'm sure there are more exotic errors I'm not thinking of.

What if we do this?: create a new class called `WQSymKeys` that has exactly one job: handle, without complaint, either packed words or ordered set partitions and converting as appropriate. Might there be a way to do this that would make the previous code-block **and** the next one run error-free?:

```
out = M.zero()
for w in OrderedSetPartitions(4):
    M.sum_of_terms((v,1) for v in op.finer())
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>\nThe default is not packed words, so when you change the display options, *you* take responsibility for realizing that *out*put is not *in*put. We are trying to make both as possibilities, but there are ambiguities in the input. We can document that we try, but to avoid ambiguities, you will need to have users explicitly cast their objects as packed words, which we can then handle in `__getitem__`, but you must have read the documentation, where it is clearly spelled out that we are using ordered set partitions as the basis. As we discussed, we can change this, but we have to change everything.\n\nAlso, `sum_of_terms` and the like assumes you are passing in good indices. However, that is a completely separate issue.",

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
The default is not packed words, so when you change the display options, *you* take responsibility for realizing that *out*put is not *in*put. We are trying to make both as possibilities, but there are ambiguities in the input. We can document that we try, but to avoid ambiguities, you will need to have users explicitly cast their objects as packed words, which we can then handle in `__getitem__`, but you must have read the documentation, where it is clearly spelled out that we are using ordered set partitions as the basis. As we discussed, we can change this, but we have to change everything.

Also, `sum_of_terms` and the like assumes you are passing in good indices. However, that is a completely separate issue.

Getting back to this ticket finally... 

After discussion at SageDays@ICERM, it seems I should scrap/revert most of the commits on this ticket. 

The new plan (submitted here for your correction or comment, if I have remembered it incorrectly):

* basis keys used internally are ordered set partitions
* print output as ordered set partitions unless global option is set to words
* adjust code so that, e.g., in `__getitem__`, 
  - first look for types `(Packed)Word` and `OrderedSetPartition`,
  - next assume the user is passing a (packed) word (as a list), 
  - and if that makes no sense, then try to view that list as an ordered set partition.
* be sure the documentation **clearly spells out** the above, and that the best way for user to have no surprises to write `M[w]` or `M[pi]`, where `w` has type (Packed)Word and `pi` has type `OrderedSetPartition`

Here are the ambiguities for the user, so far as I can tell:

* `M[1,2,3]`  -- will output `M[{1},{2},{3}]` while the user may have meant `M[{1,2,3}]`
* `M[This is the Trac macro *1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2,3-macro)` -- will output  `M[{1},{2},{3}]` while the user may have meant `M[{1,2,3}]`
* `M[This is the Trac macro *[1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#[1,2,3-macro)]` -- will output `M[{1,2,3}]` and surely the user did not mean `M[{1},{2},{3}]`
* `M[1,1,2]` -- will correctly output `M[{1,2},{3}]`, while at present it would output `M[{1,2}]`

Thank you for working more on this. Here are my comments.

You have to handle zeros better:

```
sage: WZ = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(ZZ)
sage: M = WZ.M()
sage: M(2)
2*M[]
sage: M(0/1)  # This is more common than you might expect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: cannot convert 0 into an element of Ordered set partitions
```
vs current:

```
sage: M(0/1)
0
```
Coercion is too strong. Ideally, you should allow conversion of scalars. `CombinatorialFreeModule` dictates that any 0 that is also in the `base_ring()` will convert, but since this is known to be an algebra, we should be better and allow the conversion of any scalar.

I don't like the punt-off of `__getitem__` to `_element_constructor_`. If you fix the above issue, than this will work:

```
sage: WQ = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: M = WQ.M()
sage: M[0/1]
```
and result in `0`. I think the assumptions you should make between the two will be different. The `__getitem__` should assume it is an OSP or packed word and let the error propagate up. I would be okay with the reverse `_element_constructor_` calling `__getitem__`.

These are the same:

```
sage: [[1,2],]
[[1, 2]]
sage: [[1,2]]
[[1, 2]]
```
Please remove the extraneous commas in the ``coproduct()` tests.

Oh my! Do I have things backwards? I thought M(...) should be the catch-all, not M[...]. And I'm happy to handle the zeros better... which of the methods would be most appropriate to handle 0/1?

Actually, looking through the error trace for your test `sage: M(0/1)`, I'm not sure why it failed... , why doesn't 0/1 get picked up by the `__call__` or `_call_` methods it tries before turning to `_element_constructor_`?

Because `0/1` is an element of `QQ`, which has no coercion into `ZZ`.

Okay. I think I misunderstood what you originally wrote... I thought you wanted `M[0/1]` to return `0`. 

I should mention that, since `M([[1,3],2]])` worked in the original code (by which I mean `M[{1,3},{2}]` was returned), I was trying to get `M[1,2,1]` to work as well. This was the origin of my messing with `_element_constructor`. But after chatting with others, it seems I shouldn't try to be so accommodating. The basis keys are OSPs, not words. END-OF-STORY.

I removed that custom method, but I could do as you propose and instead let `_element_constructor_` pass off to `__getitem__`. 
Otherwise, I think this patch is ready for review.

Don't do `isinstance(x, (int, Integer))`. Use `x in ZZ`. Getting rational numbers instead of true integers is a very easy trap to fall into.

I also think it would be good to document explicitly some of the ambiguities and says what it defaults to treating it as when it is ambiguous.
