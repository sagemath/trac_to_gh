I am not happy with the current (development branch) situation, but also not happy with this branch... worrying about end-user getting unexpected results from misuse of `.monomial`, `.sum_of_terms`, etc.

For instance, if users see packed words in their output (e.g., `M[1,1,2,1]`) and also are allowed to write `M[1,1,2,1]` as input, they will be inclined to write code like this:

```
out = M.zero()
for w in PackedWords(4):
    M.sum_of_terms((v,1) for v in w. right_weak_order_greater())
```
This may only cause confusion once per user, but I'm sure there are more exotic errors I'm not thinking of.

What if we do this?: create a new class called `WQSymKeys` that has exactly one job: handle, without complaint, either packed words or ordered set partitions and converting as appropriate. Might there be a way to do this that would make the previous code-block **and** the next one run error-free?:

```
out = M.zero()
for w in OrderedSetPartitions(4):
    M.sum_of_terms((v,1) for v in op.finer())
```

Getting back to this ticket finally... 

After discussion at SageDays@ICERM, it seems I should scrap/revert most of the commits on this ticket. 

The new plan (submitted here for your correction or comment, if I have remembered it incorrectly):

* basis keys used internally are ordered set partitions
* print output as ordered set partitions unless global option is set to words
* adjust code so that, e.g., in `__getitem__`, 
  - first look for types `(Packed)Word` and `OrderedSetPartition`,
  - next assume the user is passing a (packed) word (as a list), 
  - and if that makes no sense, then try to view that list as an ordered set partition.
* be sure the documentation **clearly spells out** the above, and that the best way for user to have no surprises to write `M[w]` or `M[pi]`, where `w` has type (Packed)Word and `pi` has type `OrderedSetPartition`

Here are the ambiguities for the user, so far as I can tell:

* `M[1,2,3]`  -- will output `M[{1},{2},{3}]` while the user may have meant `M[{1,2,3}]`
* `M[This is the Trac macro *1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2,3-macro)` -- will output  `M[{1},{2},{3}]` while the user may have meant `M[{1,2,3}]`
* `M[This is the Trac macro *[1,2,3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#[1,2,3-macro)]` -- will output `M[{1,2,3}]` and surely the user did not mean `M[{1},{2},{3}]`
* `M[1,1,2]` -- will correctly output `M[{1,2},{3}]`, while at present it would output `M[{1,2}]`

Thank you for working more on this. Here are my comments.

You have to handle zeros better:

```
sage: WZ = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(ZZ)
sage: M = WZ.M()
sage: M(2)
2*M[]
sage: M(0/1)  # This is more common than you might expect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: cannot convert 0 into an element of Ordered set partitions
```
vs current:

```
sage: M(0/1)
0
```
Coercion is too strong. Ideally, you should allow conversion of scalars. `CombinatorialFreeModule` dictates that any 0 that is also in the `base_ring()` will convert, but since this is known to be an algebra, we should be better and allow the conversion of any scalar.

I don't like the punt-off of `__getitem__` to `_element_constructor_`. If you fix the above issue, than this will work:

```
sage: WQ = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: M = WQ.M()
sage: M[0/1]
```
and result in `0`. I think the assumptions you should make between the two will be different. The `__getitem__` should assume it is an OSP or packed word and let the error propagate up. I would be okay with the reverse `_element_constructor_` calling `__getitem__`.

These are the same:

```
sage: [[1,2],]
[[1, 2]]
sage: [[1,2]]
[[1, 2]]
```
Please remove the extraneous commas in the ``coproduct()` tests.

No, you are correct. However, `M[foo]` should not return anything that is not a basis element corresponding (under some map) to `foo`.

Because `0/1` is an element of `QQ`, which has no coercion into `ZZ`.

Edit - Forgot to answer your first question.

I agree with you, which is why I do not like the `__getitem__` calling `_element_constructor_`.

Okay. I think I misunderstood what you originally wrote... I thought you wanted `M[0/1]` to return `0`. 

I should mention that, since `M([[1,3],2]])` worked in the original code (by which I mean `M[{1,3},{2}]` was returned), I was trying to get `M[1,2,1]` to work as well. This was the origin of my messing with `_element_constructor`. But after chatting with others, it seems I shouldn't try to be so accommodating. The basis keys are OSPs, not words. END-OF-STORY.

I removed that custom method, but I could do as you propose and instead let `_element_constructor_` pass off to `__getitem__`. 
Otherwise, I think this patch is ready for review.

Don't do `isinstance(x, (int, Integer))`. Use `x in ZZ`. Getting rational numbers instead of true integers is a very easy trap to fall into.

I also think it would be good to document explicitly some of the ambiguities and says what it defaults to treating it as when it is ambiguous.
