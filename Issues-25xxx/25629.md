sage 8.3 beta 6.


```
    sage: var('t')
    sage: anti=integrate(exp(t)*log(1+t),t)
    sage: anti
    e^(-1)*exp_integral_e(1, -t - 1) + e^t*log(t + 1)

    sage: latex(anti)
    e^{\left(-1\right)} exp_integral_e\left(1, -t - 1\right) + e^{t} \log\left(t + 1\right)

```

The latex above is not good at all. It renders as (do not know how to inser images here).


Which is not good. May be sage needs to use a `\DeclareMathOperator` on `exp_integral_e`

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

It seems this can be accomplished by adding a custom `_print_latex_` method such as this one from Bessel to the classes in `src/sage/functions/exp_integral.pyc`, it looks like `E_n` is a pretty accepted notation for it.

```
    def _print_latex_(self, n, z):
        """
        Custom ``_print_latex_`` method.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: latex(bessel_J(1, x))
            J_{1}(x)
        """
        return r"J_{%s}(%s)" % (latex(n), latex(z))
```

Possibly the arguments like `latex_name=r'exp_integral_e',` should also be removed in the same file then.

Some of these look good, but others seem like the code has been made more complicated and the output worse looking, for example before this patch

```
sage: latex(sin_integral(x))
\operatorname{Si}\left(x\right)

```

which renders in latex with roman Si which looks better than without the `operatorname`.

Replying to [@alexjbest](#comment%3A11):

Then is it okay if I change the first two classes only (the ones whose LaTeX output is not rendered properly at all without the patch)?
