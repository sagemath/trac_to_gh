Mathjax v3.2.0 was released on 2021-06-17, see [https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax).

This will be done in three steps: 

- Step 1: Fix Sage to be compatible with MathJax3. Done in #31517.
- Step 2: Provide mathjax spkg upgraded to MathJax3. 
- Step 3: Configure Sage to use MathJax3.

This ticket focuses on the Steps 2 and 3. 

To install mathjax, you can download the tarball from a temporary URL:

  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tMjjIwftzoGngFh549_kUO3Chmy3qhI/view?usp=sharing

and place the tarball in `upstream/` and `make`, or you can just do `make` since the tarball will be automatically downloaded from the attachment of this ticket after unsuccessful attempts to download from sage mirrors.

We can now choose whether to use mathjax CDN or not. The default is not to. To use CDN, do

```
export SAGE_DOCBUILD_OPTS="--use-cdns"
```
before `make` online doc.

It's worth paying attention to the fact that Mathjax 3 is missing a significant feature that might be really critical for Sage, which is "automatic line breaking".  See the discussion here:

https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2312#issuecomment-692695446

E.g., "So line breaking and other features will most likely have to wait until next year."  "That's the reason why nearly nobody is using MathJax 3."   etc.

I think this is very important to be aware of, and it's one reason why CoCalc doesn't use MathJax 3, and uses KaTeX by default.   For some applications automatic line breaking probably isn't so important, but it might be very important for Sage, due to people often printing out polynomials and big formulas.

It is jupyter people who decides what math rendering web engine is used in jupyter, which is the official frontend of Sage. I think whether Sage will be moving to MathJax3 or something else is dependent on what they do.

To support #33600, I prepared a new package for mathjax3.

I've never done creating a spkg before and don't understand everything about this business. So please help. This is a public branch!

I used the mathjax2 spkg as a template, and managed to place a tarball in `upstream/` directory and install from it to `local/share/mathjax3` by `sage -i mathjax3`.

I thought of adding mathjax3 side by side with mathjax(2). But it seems that we don't need to keep mathjax(2) once we have mathjax3 in sage.

So now I am thinking of replacing the mathjax(2) with the new mathjax(3). Then we don't need a sage-devel discussion...

As I understand it, it is only relevant with the mathjax used with jupyter.

Presently the mathjax used by Sphinx for sage documentation is different from the mathjax used by jupyter. So we don't need to worry about the issue.

Okay, makes sense to leave the tar untouched. What about only copying the tex-chtml file to `SAGE_SHARE` in `spkg-install.in`? This could then be easily extended to include other extensions etc if needed in the future.

Also I think the uncommented code in `spkg-src` can be safely deleted. The folder structure of the mathjax releases changed completely, so the mathjax 2 stuff is outdated. And if there is something useful in it, one could also use git history to recover it easily.

It would be "easy" only if all mathjax files are already in `local/share/mathjax`. The size of this directory only slightly increases with this ticket.

I don't know how the distro package works. Can't they change the installation script to install the package as they want, that is, into `/usr/share/mathjax`?

If they can't, would it solve the problem that the spkg tarball consists of mathjax files instead of the single directory? If we do so, then we need to touch the spkg installation procedure.

OK, I see.

It's unfortunate that sphinx doesn't allow to specify a single dir to be copied into `_static`, this would allow the issue to be solved cleanly. I've opened a ticket upstream for this https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10499 so we can have a reasonable solution eventually.

For now, if we can't come up with a better solution, I guess I can just copy the mathjax dir to some temporary location at build time and set that as `MATHJAX_DIR`

True. Thanks.

I experimented with the idea of using a symbolic link instead of copying, but it didn't work. Still no better solution. Thanks.
