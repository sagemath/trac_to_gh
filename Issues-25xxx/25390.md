We can currently (#8544) factor univariate polynomials over QQbar:

```
sage: R.<x>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+1).factor()
(x - I) * (x + I)
```

We can factor over multivariate rings, if the polynomial is actually univariate:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+1).factor()
(x - I) * (x + I)
```

But we can't do full "absolute factorization" (that's what it's called in the literature):

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+y^2).factor()
...
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
sage: (x^2+y^2).factor(proof=False)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
```

This ticket implements absolute factorization by calling Singular's `absfact.lib`, which works for rings over Q (or transcendental extensions thereof), and uses a technique described in the attached document to handle number fields.

I flagged it `major` because polynomial factorization is a fundamental feature that blocks the implementation of other things, like primary decomposition of ideals.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I added code to call Singular's `absFactorize` if the polynomial's coefficients are in `QQ`.

Here's what's now possible:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQbar[]

sage: L = (x^2+y^2).factor()
sage: L
((-1*I)*x - y) * (1*I*x - y)
sage: L.value()
x^2 + y^2

sage: p = (-7*x^2 + 2*x*y^2 + 6*x + y^4 + 14*y^2 + 47)*(5*x^2+y^2)^3*(x-y)^4
sage: F = p.factor()
sage: F
...
sage: F.value() == p
True
```

But something like this still doesn't work (because the coefficients aren't in `QQ`):

```
sage: (x+QQbar(sqrt(2))*y).factor()
```

It's something, which is better than nothing, so I think we should move it towards `master`, but there's still a lot of work to be done before this ticket is closed.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I agree that small improvements are good. We can always do followup tickets to add more functionality. I do have some comments:

Can we use `libsingular` instead of calls to `singular` (which uses the pexpect interface and is much slower)?

Doc tweaks:

```diff
         ALGORITHM:
 
-        Uses Singular's `absfact` library.
+        Uses Singular's ``absfact`` library.

+            Implement absolute factorization over number fields.
```
Also if you could split the long output line so that it is at most ~80 chars per line.

Instead of `elem_map`, you could just use `elem_dict.__getitem__`.

I don't see the need for the internal functions `polynomial_map` and `reverse_polynomial_map`. These little trivial functions make the code harder to follow.

In Python, usually `assert`s are with spaces, e.g., `assert minpoly.degree() == 0`.

I have two small additional nitpicks, but otherwise this ticket is a positive review assuming #25351 (which I cannot review as that is much more involved mathematically, you should cc some people who work more in that area, such as jdemeyer).

You do not need to create a list:

```diff
norm_f = prod([numfield_f.map_coefficients(h) for h in numfield.embeddings(QQbar)]).change_ring(QQ)
norm_f = prod(numfield_f.map_coefficients(h) for h in numfield.embeddings(QQbar)).change_ring(QQ)

```
although I think it would be better to reference the book in the master ref file and use `- [Geddes1234]_ Section 8.8` as the reference.

P=PolynomialRing(QQ,len(k.gens()+R.gens()),'T')   
G=sum(P({(0,)+tuple(k):1})*v.polynomial()(P.0) for k,v in g.dict().iteritems())
NG=G.resultant(k.polynomial()(P.0),P.0)
