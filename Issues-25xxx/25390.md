We can currently (#8544) factor univariate polynomials over QQbar:

```
sage: R.<x>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+1).factor()
(x - I) * (x + I)
```

We can factor over multivariate rings, if the polynomial is actually univariate:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+1).factor()
(x - I) * (x + I)
```

But we can't do full "absolute factorization" (that's what it's called in the literature):

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQbar[]
sage: (x^2+y^2).factor()
...
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
sage: (x^2+y^2).factor(proof=False)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
```

This ticket implements absolute factorization by calling Singular's `absfact.lib`, which works for rings over Q (or transcendental extensions thereof), and uses a technique described in the attached document to handle number fields.

I flagged it `major` because polynomial factorization is a fundamental feature that blocks the implementation of other things, like primary decomposition of ideals.

Depends on #25351

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I added code to call Singular's `absFactorize` if the polynomial's coefficients are in `QQ`.

Here's what's now possible:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQbar[]

sage: L = (x^2+y^2).factor()
sage: L
((-1*I)*x - y) * (1*I*x - y)
sage: L.value()
x^2 + y^2

sage: p = (-7*x^2 + 2*x*y^2 + 6*x + y^4 + 14*y^2 + 47)*(5*x^2+y^2)^3*(x-y)^4
sage: F = p.factor()
sage: F
...
sage: F.value() == p
True
```

But something like this still doesn't work (because the coefficients aren't in `QQ`):

```
sage: (x+QQbar(sqrt(2))*y).factor()
```

It's something, which is better than nothing, so I think we should move it towards `master`, but there's still a lot of work to be done before this ticket is closed.

I agree that small improvements are good. We can always do followup tickets to add more functionality. I do have some comments:

Can we use `libsingular` instead of calls to `singular` (which uses the pexpect interface and is much slower)?

Doc tweaks:

```diff
         ALGORITHM:
 
-        Uses Singular's `absfact` library.
+        Uses Singular's ``absfact`` library.
 
-        TODO:
+        .. TODO::
 
-        Implement absolute factorization over number fields
+            Implement absolute factorization over number fields.
```
Also if you could split the long output line so that it is at most ~80 chars per line.

Instead of `elem_map`, you could just use `elem_dict.__getitem__`.

I don't see the need for the internal functions `polynomial_map` and `reverse_polynomial_map`. These little trivial functions make the code harder to follow.

In Python, usually `assert`s are with spaces, e.g., `assert minpoly.degree() == 0`.

Over the weekend I remembered a technique that I read years ago for factoring over a number field - factor the norm of the polynomial, which has rational coefficients and is a multiple of the original polynomial.

So, this ticket is moving towards `closed` more quickly that I had thought possible.  I think it can now factor any polynomial over `QQbar`.

The algorithm is tricky enough that I'm planning to write up a short paper describing it, post it on arxiv, and link to it from the documentation.  If anybody has a better suggestion for how to incorporate a three page paper explaining the algorithm of a Sage method, please let me know.

I took most of `tscrim`'s suggestions, but I can't figure out how to access a Singular variable from `libsingular`.  I posted a [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42413) on asksage, but so far no answer.

I also intend to implement factorization over `AA` before flipping this ticket to `needs_review`.

You do not need to create a list:

```diff
norm_f = prod([numfield_f.map_coefficients(h) for h in numfield.embeddings(QQbar)]).change_ring(QQ)
norm_f = prod(numfield_f.map_coefficients(h) for h in numfield.embeddings(QQbar)).change_ring(QQ)
```

```diff

If at all possible, you'll probably want to avoid computing norms by multiplying complex embeddings together. Especially when you have your polynomial over a number field, it's probably much better to avoid floats altogether. For instance, if your number field is given as K=QQ[t]/(h(t)) (with h(t) monic) and you have a polynomial f(x) in K[x], then you can represent your polynomial as F(x,t) in QQ[x,t], via the isomorphism K[x] ~ Q[x,t]/(h(t)). Then you have that

Norm_(K[x]/Q[x]) (f) = Resultant(F,h,t)

Code for computing resultants is usually quite optimized. You can experiment a bit to see which approach works best, but I'd expect the resultant to work quite well.

Variable names might be haunting us here:

```
sage: k=NumberField(x^2+1,"x")
sage: R=PolynomialRing(k,"x,y")
sage: P=PolynomialRing(QQ,k.gens()+R.gens())
ValueError: variable name 'x' appears more than once
```
Unless you can guarantee the variable names of the number field and the polynomial ring aren't clashing, it seems you cannot go about the problem this way. While it would be reasonable to assume that a user wouldn't intentionally throw this kind of awful naming at you, it's quite conceivable that automatic code would end up doing something like this. Example:

```
sage: matrix(k,2,2,[k.0,0,0,1]).charpoly()
x^2 + (-x - 1)*x + x
```
So it would seem the names of your variables for the trivariate ring should be unrelated to the names that occur for the others. Assuming you have a polynomial g in a ring P over a number field k over QQ, I think you can do your conversion with something along the lines of

```
R=g.parent()
k=R.base_ring()
P=PolynomialRing(QQ,len(k.gens()+R.gens()),'T')   
G=sum(P({(0,)+tuple(k):1})*v.polynomial()(P.0) for k,v in g.dict().iteritems())
NG=G.resultant(k.polynomial()(P.0),P.0)
RQ=PolynomialRing(QQ,R.gens())
NGQ=NG((0,)+RQ.gens())
```
Doing your conversions like this has the advantage that you don't rely on names of generators at all.

Please don't think that unpacking a polynomial into a dictionary is the best way of handling it! To "lift" number field elements, I didn't see another way, but in this case

```
norm_f = norm_flat((0,)+norm_ring.gens())
```
would work just fine, as far as I can see. If you have a good reason to use the dict upacking (is it faster?) then it's fine, of course; but otherwise using the simpler code is probably preferable.

 TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined

-I was going to implement this using Singular's `absfact.lib`, but then I realized that those routines only work for rings over Q (or transcendental extensions thereof), and not over number fields.
-
-So, it's not just as easy as calling `absFactorize`.
+This ticket implements absolute factorization by calling Singular's `absfact.lib`, which works for rings over Q (or transcendental extensions thereof), and uses a technique described in the attached document to handle number fields.
 
 I flagged it `major` because polynomial factorization is a fundamental feature that blocks the implementation of other things, like primary decomposition of ideals.
