I don't think we should be in any hurry on this.  All the last ~year's work of Python 3 porting has been targeting Python 3.6, and I think I'd rather stick with that before risking throwing everything out of whack again.

Between Python 3.6 and 3.7 I suspect the differences, if any, will be minor.  But I'd rather try to stabilize on 3.6 first (to which we're quite close), then deal with those differences, rather than change Python versions again.  Also I don't know that Python 3.7 has been ported to Cygwin yet (although it does contain a number of useful fixes for Cygwin, I do know).

That said, if you know any specific changes in Python 3.7 (other than the aforementioned Cygwin fixes) that would actively make our porting effort easier I'd consider it...

Jeroen has said elsewhere that islice will accept Sage integers instead of just ints.

I am again becoming tired and frustated by the slow pace of progress towards py3. And by the large amount of difficult work that remains..

#25391 is a pretty serious issue which is fixed by a Python upgrade (probably also by upgrading to 3.6.6 but I haven't tested that).

First of all, I *do not* think that this 3.6 -> 3.7 will throw everything out of whack.

However, regardless of that, we'll have to upgrade sooner or later. I don't see the point of having a perfectly working Sage on an outdated Python version. And for the many issues that we still have to fix, it would be better to make sure that they work on Python 3.7 from the start.

Most of which Python 3.7 won't help with.  The one area where it might is sorting of dicts, since dict insertion order is now preserved (hooray!)

Well, I'm not completely opposed to upgrading, just skeptical, and don't want to rush into it.  When I get a chance I'll compare how my python3 branch fares with and without it.

The solution seems to be recythonizing. Maybe we should just do that when building numpy.

If you look in the `setup.py` file of `numpy`, you'll see

```
    from setuptools import setup
    if run_build:
        from numpy.distutils.core import setup
        cwd = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
        if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(cwd, 'PKG-INFO')):
            # Generate Cython sources, unless building from source release
            generate_cython()
```

So I guess that removing the `PKG-INFO` file in `spkg-install` will force recythonization.

Building sage with this ticket and it's dependencies works fine.

I have made two run of `sage -t -a --long`, one with a sage python3.6 and one with this ticket. Comparing the logs of the two runs (and weakly idenfying a failure by the tuple (<sage file with the failure>, <line of the failure>) with a little script, i get the following results:

```
nb doctests failures with python3.6: 42990
nb doctests failures with python3.7: 43643
new python3.7 failures : 1366
python3.6 failures not appearing with python 3.7 : 713
```

Two exemple failures among 1366 :

It seems that older Python versions vendored libffi but this was changed in Python 3.7. See https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#build-changes

Wow, I have several PRs pending...  FWIW the only two that are major blockers for Python on Cygwin are:

https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/4348
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8712

Of course, that alone doesn't necessarily need to block Sage's Python 3 spkg--as it is I believe we already include some custom patches for Cygwin, and I'm okay with that for now.  I just brought it up since you asked about the status on Cygwin.  Also, beyond those patches, there may be other issues.

> So does that mean you think we should fix problems like `itertools.islice` in sage rather than waiting for 3.7 ?


Yes, and for two reasons:

1) We've already fixed those problems in several cases; probably even the majority of them (I have a few more in my Python 3 branch I haven't even made tickets for yet).

2) We will likely have to work around that anyway for downstream distros, unless we want to make 3.7 a hard requirement for Sage.  But that might be tough, at least in the near term...

I have two questions here:

* do we have the approval of Erik (about Windows) ?
* does the branch pass all the tests in the current python3 target ?

EDIT: I have no problem with gap either.

I reduced the problem to the shell command

```
echo 'Reset(GlobalMersenneTwister,500837550);' | ./sage --gap -r -b -p -T -E local/share/sage/ext/gap/sage.g
```
This is outputting binary garbage which Python 3 cannot convert to a string.

I don't think it's caused by this ticket, but it does prevent me from working on Python 3.

For myself, I've been waiting until some of the other issues with this branch are worked out--i.e. that it's otherwise good-to-go on Linux.

But if you think that's nearly the case I should start now, since building on Windows takes some time.

I see; this is a recurrence of the problem I originally described here: #25107#comment:14

It's resurfaced, because the `tempfile` module has been refactored, now in such a way that merely setting the `_TemporaryFileWrapper.deleted` attribute no longer has *any* effect whatsoever (it should really probably be a property which delegates to the new `_TemporaryFileCloser` object.

I think this may be a broader issue with `NamedTemporaryFile` that is not unique just to Cygwin: If you create a `NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True)` in a parent process, then add it as an attribute on a `Process` subclass, when the worker process exits the file is deleted. But then when the temporary file is closed on the parent side it tries to re-delete the already deleted file.  I think more generally it would be best if ENOENT errors were just ignored in this case.

If you would consider including [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/b124a898c7315412a071a8ccc7028604192f3af8), or something like it, that would resolve the problem I'm having with unhandled exceptions in `_TemporaryFileCloser.__del__ `.

With this fix, I can see more clearly that there are two test failures remaining on Cygwin:

```
sage -t --long src/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```

The first one is merely a manifestation of #27514.  Still need to rethink exactly how that test is implemented.

The second is more disconcerting, being a segfault (but at least repeatable).  I will look into it next.

Why would you do that?  I explicitly pointed out that something was broken and proposed a fix, but that fix wasn't applied yet.  Doing this "**now**" has no direct impact on making progress on #27519.  You're just rushing things for no reason and leaving them broken.
