Sorry to be late to the party but are you aware of `combinat/q_analogues.py`?  In particular, this module provides functions `q_int`, `q_factorial` and `q_binomial` (among others). I have not been through this ticket in detail but comparing the `q_int` function in this ticket appears to be less general than the existing function because, in `q_analogues.py`, `q_int(n)` allows `n` to be positive or negative whereas the `q_int` function in this ticket requires `n` to be non-negative. On the other hand, the quantum integer that the existing `q_int` returns is different to the one in this ticket. 

I am not sure how much this ticket overlaps with the code that is already in sage but some one should check. At a minimum, I think that there should be some documentation links between this code and the pre-existing code and, arguably, the code should be merged so that we don't have code providing similar functionality in different places. Different function names, or a more general syntax that allows one to choose between the different quantum integers, should also be considered. 

Annoyingly, the `q_int` defined in `q_analogues.py` is the natural quantum integer to use in Hecke algebras whereas the `q_int` defined in this ticket is what is required in the quantum group setting...so both are needed. 

As I have not read through all of the code I won't set this back to needs work but my feeling is that it does need more work.
