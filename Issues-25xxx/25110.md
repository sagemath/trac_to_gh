```
Currently, the function in *quadratic_form_reduction_theory.py* to Minkowski reduce a basis returns an incorrect output.  For example:

```
sage: Q=QuadraticForm(ZZ,3,[1,-2,0,2,0,2])
sage: Q.Gram_matrix()

[ 1 -1  0]
[-1  2  0]
[ 0  0  2]
sage: Q.minkowski_reduction()

(
Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 -2 0 ]                                                         
[ * 2 0 ]                                                          
[ * * 2 ]                                                          ,

[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
)
```

But this is by definition (see for example Cassels "Rational Quadratic Forms" p. 255) not Minkowski reduced, since   

```
Q(1,1,0) < Q(0,1,0).
```

A correct Minkowski reduced matrix equivalent to the one given, would be 

```
Quadratic form in 3 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 0 0 ]
[ * 1 0 ]
[ * * 2 ]
```

There is also a problem that this function runs on an infinite loop (rather than raising an error flag) when an indefinite quadratic form is entered.

Actually (I'm sorry), I take it back.
I think there is a typo in Schulze-Pillot's paper. Where it says m>=4 in the algorithm it should really say m<= 4.
I'm not convinced that the algorithm implemented here works for more that 4 variables.
It seems to me that the coefficients *s_i* are taken in {0,-1,1} but this should only work for at most 4 variables.
I haven't thought about this a lot and so I'm changing the status to 'needs info' first. 
But I suspect that this actually needs work...
