According to `giac/SPKG.txt`,

```
The english documentation will be installed in:
       $SAGE_LOCAL/share/giac/doc/en/cascmd_en/index.html
```
but this does not seem to happen. In particular, the source code directory `doc/en` contains a lot of things, including subdirectories `cascmd_en`, `casinter`, and `tutoriel`, which I think should be installed, but are not.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
At least in Gentoo I install all that stuff manually, from the prepackaged stuff. According to the notes in spkg-src the french doc is removed because it is huge and not GPL. Nothing is said about the English version but it should be checked.
