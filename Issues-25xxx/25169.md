In a python3-sage run of the patchbot:

Testing that Sage starts...
[2018-04-14 19:22:09] SageMath version 8.2.rc2, Release Date: 2018-04-10
This looks like the first time you are running Sage.
Cleaning up, do not interrupt this.
Done cleaning.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/chapoton/sage3/src/bin/sage-eval", line 10, in <module>
    eval(compile(s,'<cmdline>','exec'))
  File "<cmdline>", line 1
    sage.all._write_started_file(); print "Yes, Sage starts."
                                                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Sage failed to start up.
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
```

The solution is to make this `print` (originally a
Python2 print statement) compatible with the
Python3 print function.
