NTL compiles with `-std=c++11` from 11.0 upwards. Apparently it is possible to compile with older c standards, but that loses thread safety.

I've added a work in progress PR that also updates the C standard for flint (necessary, see https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/487). However sagelib won't build because lcalc still compiles with gnu++98 (#23341).

ntl 11 uses c++11, so "distutils: extra_compile_args = -std=gnu++98" has to be removed from sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction (which depends on both ntl and lcalc), so lcalc headers need to be c++11 compliant.

FWIW, I've already bumped ntl on Arch, and it mostly works fine in practice. The main issue is that it seems to bail out on some degenerate input, eg

```
> sage -t sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx

[...]

sage: matrix(ZZ,3,[1..9]).hermite_form(algorithm='ntl') ## line 1807 ##

halt 2

It technically "depends" on NTL but for no good reason.

If that's the only issue, untangling this dependency would be the easiest solution.

OK I patch enough that it compile out of the box with g++-7.3.0 without passing a `-std=c++...` flag so I am guessing I get gnu++11 at the least. Lots of warnings that stuff is deprecated or forbidden, but g++ takes it. clang++, on the other hand, breaks

```
fatal error: 'bits/c++config.h' file not found
```
Of course no one should use those kinds of headers in the first place. I am sure it is fixed in the pull request you are quoting at least.

I am not sure what motivated that. `@`Timo can you comment here?

In any case there is an `export CFLAGS` in the conditional for debugging and one outside. We could just keep the one outside. 

Could it be that it was meant for `CXXFLAGS` instead and add `-std=c++11` there? There is a single object built with C++ in flint, the ntl interface. I cannot test that theory because I don't have a compiler old enough that would default to something lower than c++11.

Hmm, OK, over to Sage's installation. If I start as

```
$ MAKE="gmake -j8" gmake
```
NTL fails with the usual invitation to look in the following file for errors, and there I see

```
$ cat src/src/CompilerOutput.log 
*** CompilerOutput.log ***
*** building GenConfigInfo
make[4]: illegal argument to -j -- must be positive integer!
```
So it seems to assume something about $MAKE...

And if I start as

```
$ MAKE="gmake" gmake
```

I get even weirder

```
*** CompilerOutput.log ***
*** building GenConfigInfo
make[4]: don't know how to make w. Stop

Could you add it to the branch?

I don't remember my reasoning. Probably some leftover of trying to get it to work nicely with the old lcalc.

Do you mean `c++11` in `CXXFLAGS`? 

There are packages (brial is one case) needing `-std=gnu++11`.

But yes, it appears now that the compilers must be told to enforce `c++11` globally,
otherwise some compilers default to something else.

So it seems it cannot be just added, it needs to be a overwriteable per package default in `CXXFLAGS`...

To be honest I should have seen that coming and I should have acted in ticket:25532#comment:37 .

Now for the idea to set std=c++11 globally by default. Well we have a variety of compilers out there defaulting to anything from pre-c++11 to c++14 and soon c++17. I don't think we should enforce going from c++14 to c++11 unless we have too. By the way brial compiles perfectly with gcc-8.2.0 which default to c++14 without having to add std=gnu++11.

In any case we can solve that at configure time with the appropriate macro (like brial does now) to check that the compiler support at least this standard and add the appropriate flag to CXXFLAGS if it doesn't.

I would like to finish this ticket as is and I'll note that since #23341 is merged distro are free to upgrade ntl and we do. This ticket is just about keeping up.

We should have a follow up ticket about minimal c++11 support and clean up for 8.6 in my opinion. This would a major feature and I don't want to start it now.

Should we fix this here too?

you got that in reverse. flint depends on ntl, so if ntl uses c++11 so does the flint-ntl interface (there is a single C++ file in flint for this interface, the rest is all C).

> Also, I imagine CXXFLAGS of mpir/gmp and gf2x need attention too.


It doesn't currently have any impact, there seem to be some forward compatibility. flint and sage would require backward compatibility.

giac's upcoming version 1.5.0 should be compileable with c++11 - at least it does work with clang 6.0.1, which is quite picky, and I think enforces c++11 by default. See #26315.

OK found the issue. We don't pass any `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS` to flint so the default are used. By default, `-ansi` is added to both `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`. For C is sets the standard to C99 and for C++, to c++98. Frankly I think we should just remove `-ansi` in both case. And since by default `CXXFLAGS` is copied from `CFLAGS`, that should be easy to do in one single change.

And distros don't choke on this because we usually provide some compilation flags.

no, this does not work. Which packages do need gnu++11 rather than c++11? I am trying now to set c++11 on Darwin globally, IIRC it used to work.

OK to set up things globally you may want to go back to the macro setting c++11/gnu++11 as the standard at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4#L97 and follow the model of fplll that asks specifically for c++11 https://github.com/fplll/fplll/blob/master/configure.ac#L56 (but do not make it mandatory).

From what I see, it would be a good idea to update the macro `/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx` as there is a recent fix for clang. 

Now the question is whether you want to try c++11 instead as the general default or just for OS X. My understanding is that cygwin works better with gnu++11.

Roughly speaking, as I understand it, the reason `-std=gnu++11` is sometimes required on Cygwin is related to the fact that Cygwin's built-in libc is not glibc but rather Cygnus/Redhat's [newlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newlib).  newlib supports most/all the usual GNU extensions but it is quite strict about requiring them to be explicitly enabled; otherwise you just get pure POSIX.

I have no idea what the problem is on macOS, but presumably there's something that is enabled in NTL when using `-std=gnu++11` but it's probably something subtle.

It turns out to be a red herring.

However, one thing I noticed that for fplll there is setting of `-std=gnu++11` for Cygwin, whereas it's already set globally...

This is on purpose. Before I enabled c++11/gnu++11 globally, it was already in place. The reason is that fplll's configure script requires a strict c++11 compiler as noted above. But cygwin needs a gnu++11 one to compile fplll. So we need to override fplll's decision on cygwin. Don't go removing it.
