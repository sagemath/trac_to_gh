```
The algorithm modifies a copy of the graph, but since the copy is also a `BipartiteGraph`, some operations are not permitted.

This patch ensures that the copy used in `Graph.vertex_cover` is a `Graph`.

It also:
- adds methods `_subgraph_by_adding` and `_subgraph_by_deleting` to `BipartiteGraph` so that methods like `connected_components_subgraphs` and `subgraph` return a `BipartiteGraph`.
- modifies the matching to work properly with non-connected graphs. In some case, the matching algorithm of networkx for bipartite graphs fails with non-connected graphs. We also remove code about weighted edges as the algorithms we have don't use weights
- implement Konig's algorithm for vertex cover.

I was thinking there might be something more efficient for bipartite graphs than the algorithms for general graphs, but nothing really comes to mind.

If you're rebuilding the graph like this:

```
+            g = Graph(data=self.edges(), format='list_of_edges',
+                          multiedges=self.allows_multiple_edges())
             g.allow_multiple_edges(False)
```
Wouldn't it be cleaner to just have `multiedges=False`?

If we set `multiedges=False`, then the constructor will raise an error if the input list of edges has multiple edges.

Concerning the algorithm. We can compute vertex cover in polynomial time in bipartite graph. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%91nig%27s_theorem_(graph_theory). We can try to implement it if you like. The algorithm itself is easy (see my quick trial below). I did some tests and directly raises other issues like the matching algorithm that do not work for non connected bipartite graphs, etc.

```
def vertex_cover(B): 
    M = Graph(B.matching())
    left = set(B.left)
    right = set(B.right)

    # Initialize Z with vertices in left that are not involved in the
    # matching
    Z = left.difference(M.vertex_iterator())

    # Alternate: extend Z with all vertices reacheable by alternate paths
    # (match / non-match edges).
    X = set(Z)
    while X:
        # Follow non matched edges
        Y = set()
        for u in X:
            for v in B.neighbors(u):
                if not v in Z and not M.has_edge(u, v):
                    Y.add(v)
        Z.update(Y)

        # Follow matched edges
        X = set()
        for u in Y:
            for v in M.neighbor_iterator(u):
                if not v in Z:
                    X.add(v)
        Z.update(X)

    return list((left.difference(Z)).union(right.intersection(Z)))

Right, Konig's Theorem. That seems like the right way to do it (provided the matching works).

Replying to [dcoudert](#comment%3A3):
> If we set `multiedges=False`, then the constructor will raise an error if the input list of edges has multiple edges.

You sure? When I use a list of edges with redundant entries as input, I get a deprecation warning when multiedges is not specified, and the redundant entries are ignored if multiedges is False.
