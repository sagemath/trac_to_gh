With Sage 8.3.beta1, I have seen the same failures as reported in #20222:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/plot/hyperbolic_regular_polygon.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/repl/rich_output/backend_sagenb.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/combinat/crystals/crystals.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 224.1 src/sage/game_theory/matching_game.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
where a typical example is

```
File "src/sage/plot/hyperbolic_regular_polygon.py", line 244, in sage.plot.hyperbolic_regular_polygon.hyperbolic_regular_polygon
Failed example:
    g.plot()
