With Sage 8.2:

sage: C.integral(lambda x, _: cosh(x), 0, 1)
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Real Field with 53 bits of precision to Complex ball field with 100 bits of precision
```
Same with `sqrt` and constants:

```
sage: C.integral(lambda x, _: sqrt(2), 0, 1)
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Symbolic Ring to Complex ball field with 100 bits of precision
```

It looks like all the ordinary (cosh, sinh, tanh, coth) hyperbolic functions are missing.

Here is also a list of some other unwrapped functions, copied from an old email (this list is maybe slightly out of date):

* arb_sec, arb_csc, arb_sech, arb_csch, acb_sec, acb_csc, acb_sech, acb_csch
* acb_expm1, arb_sinc, arb_sinc_pi, acb_sinc, acb_sinc_pi
* arb_sgn, acb_sgn, acb_csgn
* Lambert W function
* Everything in the acb_elliptic module
* Everything in the arb_hypgeom module
* can_round methods
* Fresnel integrals
* Different versions of incomplete gamma functions
* Incomplete beta function
* arb_bernoulli_poly_ui, acb_bernoulli_poly_ui + bernoulli/euler/partition numbers
* Real matrices (I didn't see if there was an issue for this already)
* FFT
* A lot of power series methods
* Maybe _acb_vec_unit_roots
* Dirichlet L-functions
* Interface to hypergeometric 2F1 for parameters differing by integers

Also:
*  acb_real_abs, acb_real_sgn, acb_real_heaviside, acb_real_floor, acb_real_ceil, acb_real_max, acb_real_min, acb_real_sqrtpos

Yes, there are still a number of functions missingâ€”but I'm not sure it makes sense to open tickets about that unless you are planning to add the necessary wrappers.

However, this:

is intentional. What you should be doing is:

```
sage: CBF.integral(lambda x, _: CBF(2).sqrt(), 0, 1)
[1.414213562373095 +/- 2.99e-16]
```

of if you really want to use the global `sqrt()` function:

```
sage: CBF.integral(lambda x, _: sqrt(CBF(2)), 0, 1)
[1.414213562373095 +/- 2.99e-16]

It has been a plan for a long time to bind the global `I` to an element of â„š[i] (see #18036), but there were backward compatibility concerns and perhaps other issues... I'll probably try reviving that ticket one day, though.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

here is a similar thing (with SR instead of a lambda) that works (with #32871 - but perhaps it's not needed):

```
sage: CBF(integral(sqrt(2), (x, 0, 1)))
[1.414213562373095 +/- 5.21e-16]
sage: C(integral(sqrt(2), (x, 0, 1)))
[1.41421356237309504880168872421 +/- 2.41e-30]
```

we had a discussion about a very similar setting (with RBF in place of CBF), and Marc convinced me that having to call conversion to RBF in real_arb.pyx (resp. to CBF in complex_arb.pyx)
is not desirable - and coersion alone need not work if you go SR->RBF (or CDF).
