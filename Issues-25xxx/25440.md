sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: S.<y> = R.fraction_field()[]
sage: (y+1)(R.one())
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

What happens here:
* `R.one()` is coerced into the coefficient ring of `y+1`, i.e., `R.fraction_field()`
* The `_evaluate_polynomial` for fraction field elements is called with `self==R.fraction_field()(R.one())` and `pol==y+1`.

```
inverse = ~self
if inverse.denominator().is_one():
   num = inverse.numerator()
   return pol.reverse()(num)/num**pol.degree()
```
* This sets `num==R.one()` and we're back to square one.

Ideally yes, but that's a lost battle.

Probably. Though, if I understand right, (some?) p-adic rings have a maximum precision, and there is an argument for declaring elements equal when they agree to the precision of the parent, or perhaps even to that of the more precise of the two elements.

Really, for me, the way equality of p-adics (and series) appear to work is closer to a bug than an implementation choice.\n\nIt's a valid alternative. Two elements are equal if they are indistinguishable. We have thought about this and it certainly has its merits. But you also have to keep this in mind when implementing generic algorithms. No matter what you do, some assumptions that exact implementations make are going to be violated, e.g., `a + b - b == a` is not true in RIF.\n\nI am not saying that we should not change the notion of equality in p-adics. I have discussed this with several people in the past and even had a ticket about this at some point. However, it's not clear what's the right notion of equality. The one we have is unfortunate but I am not convinced anymore that there is a better one.\n\nAnyway, while things are the way they are, I'd like to fix this precision issue in Sage. If you are opposed to this, I don't mind at all to take this out of this changeset and propose it on a different ticket and continue the discussion there :)",

> I'm not so sure: intervals have exactly the same issue, but they only declare equal elements that are, and they work reasonably well with the rest of Sage... Really, for me, the way equality of p-adics (and series) appear to work is closer to a bug than an implementation choice.

It's a valid alternative. Two elements are equal if they are indistinguishable. We have thought about this and it certainly has its merits. But you also have to keep this in mind when implementing generic algorithms. No matter what you do, some assumptions that exact implementations make are going to be violated, e.g., `a + b - b == a` is not true in RIF.

I am not saying that we should not change the notion of equality in p-adics. I have discussed this with several people in the past and even had a ticket about this at some point. However, it's not clear what's the right notion of equality. The one we have is unfortunate but I am not convinced anymore that there is a better one.

Anyway, while things are the way they are, I'd like to fix this precision issue in Sage. If you are opposed to this, I don't mind at all to take this out of this changeset and propose it on a different ticket and continue the discussion there :)

Yes, of course. And I wholeheartedly agree that Sage is missing finer grained comparison operators. But I thought the (weak) consensus to deal with the situation—not only in the context of intervals, but also, e.g., for method that do their best to answer undecidable questions—was to stick as much as possible to the convention that positive boolean answers must be correct, while negative ones may mean “I don't  know”. In any case, that's the convention I try to apply when writing or reviewing generic code where the issue might arise.

And, at #25318, I'm proposing to remove the doctest you added, because it breaks with the changes in that ticket, and I see no way of making things work both with p-adics and with parents that use what I consider the correct semantics for `is_one()`.
