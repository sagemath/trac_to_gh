Because of a broken version of [backports.shutil_get_terminal_size](https://github.com/chrippa/backports.shutil_get_terminal_size), some distros show tracebacks without spacing as follows:

```
    ZeroDivisionErrorTraceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: rational division by zero
```

Apparently [debian has the same problem](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/e063adfe71044302f7777bd1d4794f6b8ca31c8d/debian/patches/u2-fix-trivial-test-cases.patch#L47).

This patch makes the doctests accept both formats.

It seems like this patch was only included to fix this formatting error (#20599). This is a bit meta, but is there a general patching policy for sage?

Sage patches a lot of its dependencies and often has very good reasons to do so. But sometimes it is not strictly necessary. That makes life hard for packagers and also for the people maintaining the sage spkgs. In my opinion patching dependencies should be a last resort, only if there is pretty much no other option.

Your patch looks good to me. I think a ` # see #25320 for the apparently unnecessary ...` or something similar would be nice to make sure that nobody takes this out on the next refactoring.

Feel free to set this to positive review once you added a comment, or also if you don't deem it necessary.

Sorry!

The issue seems to be the missing initial `...` at

```
Expected:
    ZeroDivisionError...Traceback (most recent call last)
```

while the test code is:

```
sage: shell.run_cell('1/0') # see #25320 for the reason of the `...` in this test
...
ZeroDivisionError...Traceback (most recent call last)
```

Does anybody know why the `...` in the first line is ignored? (Or why this wasn't caught by my local tests).

Instead we should choose the most practical solution. But by now we're just repeating our arguments -- I'm just going to accept that dropping the patch is not an option.\n\nYeah the owner hasn't had any [GitHub](GitHub) activity in ages. Best case would be if somebody would just fork it. Looks like there is not much maintenance needed besides reviewing the occasional patch. However I don't really feel comfortable running a python library project myself, as I have no knowledge about the ecosystem (setup.py, pypy etc).\n\n> > One patch less is one problem less and this patch seems to bring little to none advantage.\n\n> \n> I consider correctly formatting exceptions a good feature to have.\n\n\nIts kinda nice but at least in my mind not even remotely worth the trouble. The wrong format still conveys all the same information and doesn't really loose any clarity.",

Its not, but I still think it doesn't matter whose fault it is. Instead we should choose the most practical solution. But by now we're just repeating our arguments -- I'm just going to accept that dropping the patch is not an option.

Yeah the owner hasn't had any [GitHub](GitHub) activity in ages. Best case would be if somebody would just fork it. Looks like there is not much maintenance needed besides reviewing the occasional patch. However I don't really feel comfortable running a python library project myself, as I have no knowledge about the ecosystem (setup.py, pypy etc).

Its kinda nice but at least in my mind not even remotely worth the trouble. The wrong format still conveys all the same information and doesn't really loose any clarity.

I agree, that'll improve the test (doctests with textual output are inherently brittle) and solve half of this problem.

What about the other one? Could we maybe replace that with another exception that is well-behaved, regardless of the backport patch level?

I skimmed through the source and the patch to get an idea, but I can't figure out how the backport even influences the ZeroDivisionError formatting, let alone how the `master.patch` fixes it.
