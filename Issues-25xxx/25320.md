Because of a broken version of [backports.shutil_get_terminal_size](https://github.com/chrippa/backports.shutil_get_terminal_size), some distros show tracebacks without spacing as follows:

```
    ZeroDivisionErrorTraceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: rational division by zero
```

Apparently [debian has the same problem](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/e063adfe71044302f7777bd1d4794f6b8ca31c8d/debian/patches/u2-fix-trivial-test-cases.patch#L47).

This patch makes the doctests accept both formats.

It seems like this patch was only included to fix this formatting error (#20599). This is a bit meta, but is there a general patching policy for sage?

Sage patches a lot of its dependencies and often has very good reasons to do so. But sometimes it is not strictly necessary. That makes life hard for packagers and also for the people maintaining the sage spkgs. In my opinion patching dependencies should be a last resort, only if there is pretty much no other option.

There is no such policy. But it might be a good topic for discussion on `sage-packaging` (do you know about that mailing list?)

Yes I do, but to my understanding the purpose of that list is packagers working together to solve packaging issues right? Such a policy would benefit packagers, but upstream developers would need to be the ones actually deciding on it and adhering to it. So I don't think discussing that on sage-packaging is very useful.

Maybe sage-devel, if there is no more proper place to discuss that?

Sorry!

The issue seems to be the missing initial `...` at

```
Expected:
    ZeroDivisionError...Traceback (most recent call last)
```

while the test code is:

```
sage: shell.run_cell('1/0') # see #25320 for the reason of the `...` in this test
...
ZeroDivisionError...Traceback (most recent call last)
```

Does anybody know why the `...` in the first line is ignored? (Or why this wasn't caught by my local tests).

Okay I could reproduce the error locally. No idea why I didn't notice that before, I must have messed up somewhere.

Apparently python will interpret those `...` at the beginning as line-continuation characters[1]. I've updated the patch with a solution for this, but its not very pretty: Print a leading dummy line.

In my opinion the best solution would be to just remove the backports patch in sage. One patch less is one problem less and this patch seems to bring little to none advantage. But judging by the mailing list discussion, @jdemeyer probably disagrees?

I agree, that'll improve the test (doctests with textual output are inherently brittle) and solve half of this problem.

What about the other one? Could we maybe replace that with another exception that is well-behaved, regardless of the backport patch level?

I skimmed through the source and the patch to get an idea, but I can't figure out how the backport even influences the ZeroDivisionError formatting, let alone how the `master.patch` fixes it.
