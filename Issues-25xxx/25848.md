These are a few assorted fixes to enable `binding=True`:

1. Enable `binding=True` on some non-performance-critical unpickling functions. These regularly occur in `__reduce__` doctests, causing annoying doctest failures. In a few cases, the unpickling function can be removed completely.

2. Compile `__getmetaclass__` with `binding=False` otherwise it won't work.

3. Resolve a cyclic import involving `sage.rings.convert.mpfi` by explicitly importing it.

4. In `src/sage/categories/category.py`, assign the helpers as staticmethod to prevent binding.
