Small updates to q_jordan:

1. Add default for `q`, like the other `q`-functions.
2. Better handling of parents.
3. Allow the `q=1` case.
4. Better documentation.

On the way, an update for the multinomial function was needed.

For future reference, it might be possible to implement ``q_jordan`` using some closed-form expression, but that is for another ticket.

For `multinomial` I would still like to use at least a list, a tuple, a Partition or a Composition as input. One example is calculating the number of elements of a given cycle type in the symmetric group, and it can come up as any of those objects.

We might need a git expert to explain how/why `q_stirling_number2` was removed. What is the best option to add it back without a new commit? I even fix it a bit in #25715.

There is not a point of wrapping `tp` as a `Partition` in the recursion part as the cache converts it over (you should actually do `_Partitions(t)` instead of `Partition(t)` because the former is faster), and then you unwrap it with `list`.

Otherwise LGTM.

`_Partitions` is a tiny bit faster indeed. Thanks.

I also thought that the extra call to `Partition` is redundant, but the recursive call to `q_jordan` is to the undecorated function. Maybe a new helper function `_cached_q_jordan` can help?

Now things are better, and use `_Partitions`, also for `q_subgroups_of_abelian_group`.

The `cached_function` decorator use the `key` argument only for comparisons in the cache, and that is why I was puzzled when checking for the empty partition, as opposed to a list composed of all zeros. The empty partition have zero length and it is `False` as a boolean:

```sage
sage: Partition([]) == Partition([0]) == Partition([0, 0])
True
```

But this is not true for lists like `[0]`, of course.

I wanted to set the ticket to positive review myself, but I would appreciate a look at the last commit for a final OK.
