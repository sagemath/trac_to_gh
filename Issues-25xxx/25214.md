currently system-wide curl is not recognised as usable by Sage if its headers are in the location not searched by $CC by default.

curl-config script actually tells you what to add to CFLAGS

```
$ curl-config --cflags
-I/usr/local/include
```

**CC:**  @embray

**Status:** new

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25214

TL; DR: It works if I set CXXFLAGS instead.

on a FreeBSD 11.1 system one has (with `t.c` basically not doing anything):

```
$ cc -I/usr/local/include  -c t.c # this works
$ cc   -c t.c                     # this doesn't 
t.c:1:9: fatal error: 'curl/curl.h' file not found
#include<curl/curl.h>
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

CFLAGS are ingnored by `./configure` in this case.
I invoke `./configure CC=cc CXX=c++ FC=gfortran6 CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"`
and still see in config.log the following:

```
configure:8259: checking for curl 7.22
configure:8292: result: /usr/local/bin/curl
configure:8298: checking curl/curl.h usability
configure:8298: c++ -c -g -O2 -std=gnu++11  conftest.cpp >&5
conftest.cpp:56:10: fatal error: 'curl/curl.h' file not found
#include <curl/curl.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

It works if I set CXXFLAGS instead, as it tests with c++ rather than with cc!

Anyhow, the real issue is whether R will pick up `curl` headers. We'll see.

Well, if it is a problem, it wasn't a cause of the problem I was trying to fix.
