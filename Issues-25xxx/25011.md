#24907 added some code to `configure.ac` that may remove files from `$SAGE_LOCAL` when running `./configure`.  This is at best a bit sketchy.  Instead it should modify something in the Makefile--e.g. enable some rule to clean up GCC.  I haven't fully considered the details yet.  Ideally a fix to this would also not conflict too much with #24919.

But whatever the case, the central issue is that if you install Sage's GCC package (I call it "sage-gcc"), and then somehow or other that gcc is broken (don't ask me how, but apparently it has happened due to past bugs), then you basically can't build any package for Sage anymore because it will try by default to use sage-gcc (since Sage-the-distribution mixes its build environment with its runtime target), and there's no way to force it *not* to.

No, if you look later in the `configure.ac` there are several compiler-related checks, mostly using standard autoconf macros; however if you have a broken sage-gcc those will fail and the end result is Sage deciding that you need to install sage-gcc even though it's already installed (but broken).

A few things about this:

1. I resent that we ship our own GCC at all.  I would just as soon not, but enough people think that's important enough that we need to bend over backwards to support it and I don't care to fight that (just make it work a little better I hope, but that's a separate issue).

2. Personally I would be fine with just saying "do a make dist-clean and try again".  But that does kind of suck because for some people building from scratch does take a very long time, and having a broken sage-gcc doesn't necessarily invalidate all the rest of the build.

3. The uninstall process itself (all the `rm -rf`'s will be improved soon as we have DESTDIR support for sage-gcc.  Then we can replace that with just `sage-spkg-uninstall gcc` and it will be much cleaner overall.

4. I'd also prefer if `./configure` just reported "you have sage-gcc but it's broken; please uninstall it".  But for automated builds and stuff like that it is kind of useful to have an automated cleanup.

This must be a buildbot setup bug, at least I cannot reproduce it. Probably the bot has a stale
./configure (as ./configure is no longer under git, the bot needs to get it somehow, autotools or not).

I think normally it is.  Because the first time I updated `configure.ac` I also provided a configure tarball (there is actually a script that makes it--you can build it by running `./bootstrap -s`).

But somebody (I think either Volker or Jeroen) told me it wasn't necessary, and I haven't needed to bother since, even with tickets that changed much more than this one.  So I'm at a loss.

It does implicitly--the top-level `Makefile` re-runs `./bootstrap` if `configure` needs to be rebuilt (i.e. `configure.ac` or any of the `m4/` files changed).

However, Volker is pointing out that this does not work for systems that don't have autoconf installed, such that running `./bootstrap` fails.

Perhaps it's new that there's a buildbot build where that is the case?  I don't remember having any problem with this before.  Obviously on a system with no autoconf it's not going to work unless they can download a new `configure` tarball.

I still don't understand.  The top-level Makefile ensures that `configure` is up-to-date by running `./bootstrap`.

Why is there even a buildbot that tries to build without autoconf?  If the configure tarball is updated when there is a release anyways, what use is this, especially if it produces false negatives?
