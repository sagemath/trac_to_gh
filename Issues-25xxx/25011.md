#24907 added some code to `configure.ac` that may remove files from `$SAGE_LOCAL` when running `./configure`.  This is at best a bit sketchy.  Instead it should modify something in the Makefile--e.g. enable some rule to clean up GCC.  I haven't fully considered the details yet.  Ideally a fix to this would also not conflict too much with #24919.

Here's one possible approach to this.  I admit it's still kind of ugly.  But it fulfills the following (arguable) requirements that I set for the solution:

1. A broken "sage-gcc" (will use this to refer explicitly to a GCC provided by Sage's gcc SPKG) is detected by configure, which should indicate this state somehow.
2. If there is a broken sage-gcc it should be cleaned up by make before building any new spkgs.
3. Once the broken sage-gcc is cleaned up, obviously no further attempt should be made by make to remove sage-gcc (once we rebuild the gcc SPKG we'll want to at least assume that it is no longer broken).
4. Subsequent calls to `configure` or just `config.status` should still double-check that we have a working sage-gcc, and if not re-indicate that to make.

This is accomplished by having `configure` spit out a little stamp file to `build/make/.clean-broken-gcc` if a broken sage-gcc is detected.  A special target is added to the Makefile `_clean-broken-gcc` which checks for that stamp file and, if it exists, cleans up the broken sage-gcc and removes the stamp file (the cleanup having been completed).  This target is then added as a prerequisite to building all SPKGs.

I find this somewhat confusing and I wonder whether we really need all this special logic for this case (I don't know about the history of this, so I might have the wrong perspectiveâ¦)

Here are a few questions:
* Do I understand correctly that we only test GCC if we provided it? Why don't we always test?
* Do we need the "uninstall" logic? Can't we just tell people that their GCC is broken and they should reinstall Sage, i.e., how frequent is this issue?

I don't exactly remember all the history myself. But whatever the case, the central issue is that if you install Sage's GCC package (I call it "sage-gcc"), and then somehow or other that gcc is broken (don't ask me how, but apparently it has happened due to past bugs), then you basically can't build any package for Sage anymore because it will try by default to use sage-gcc (since Sage-the-distribution mixes its build environment with its runtime target), and there's no way to force it *not* to.  So sage-gcc is installed but broken it's necessary as soon as possible to remove it.

The immediate background to this ticket, then, is that in #24907 Jeroen added a workaround which "fixes" it by `rm -rf`ing files from sage-gcc if it exists, and is broken.  The problem is that this is done by the `./configure` script itself, which really ought not to be writing things to `$SAGE_LOCAL` at all.

This fix then just uses `./configure` to test whether sage-gcc exists and is broken, and adds a special make target to clean it up immediately before trying to build anything else.  Therefore the existing Sage environment can still keep working, and sage-gcc can even be reinstalled if desired.

> Here are a few questions:

No, if you look later in the `configure.ac` there are several compiler-related checks, mostly using standard autoconf macros; however if you have a broken sage-gcc those will fail and the end result is Sage deciding that you need to install sage-gcc even though it's already installed (but broken).  This leads to basically an infinite loop of Sage trying to reinstall sage-gcc.

Therefore it's necessary to have an explicit test for this case early on and make note of it.

> * Do we need the "uninstall" logic? Can't we just tell people that their GCC is broken and they should reinstall Sage, i.e., how frequent is this issue?

A few things about this:

1. I resent that we ship our own GCC at all.  I would just as soon not, but enough people think that's important enough that we need to bend over backwards to support it and I don't care to fight that (just make it work a little better I hope, but that's a separate issue).

3. The uninstall process itself (all the `rm -rf`'s will be improved soon as we have DESTDIR support for sage-gcc.  Then we can replace that with just `sage-spkg-uninstall gcc` and it will be much cleaner overall.

4. I'd also prefer if `./configure` just reported "you have sage-gcc but it's broken; please uninstall it".  But for automated builds and stuff like that it is kind of useful to have an automated cleanup.

The fact that we ship gcc is largely due to the need to provide gfortran (or some other modern fortran) on OSX.

Perhaps we should separate Sage from Sage's build toolchain, this would be a step towards despahgettifying this a bit.

I am 100% in favor of that and have a plan in mind for doing so.  But it's yet another herculean task that I'm not prepared to take on until I've made more progress on a few others (though it would certainly make some things I'm trying to do easier--maybe I shouldn't gone with my first instinct of pushing more for that in the first place).

I think normally it is.  Because the first time I updated `configure.ac` I also provided a configure tarball (there is actually a script that makes it--you can build it by running `./bootstrap -s`).

But somebody (I think either Volker or Jeroen) told me it wasn't necessary, and I haven't needed to bother since, even with tickets that changed much more than this one.  So I'm at a loss.

It does implicitly--the top-level `Makefile` re-runs `./bootstrap` if `configure` needs to be rebuilt (i.e. `configure.ac` or any of the `m4/` files changed).

However, Volker is pointing out that this does not work for systems that don't have autoconf installed, such that running `./bootstrap` fails.

Perhaps it's new that there's a buildbot build where that is the case?  I don't remember having any problem with this before.  Obviously on a system with no autoconf it's not going to work unless they can download a new `configure` tarball.

...and Sage also does this.

However, the buildbots don't build from a release, they build from the git repo. So this is purely a buildbot workflow issue, not a Sage release issue.

I still don't understand.  The top-level Makefile ensures that `configure` is up-to-date by running `./bootstrap`.

Why is there even a buildbot that tries to build without autoconf?  If the configure tarball is updated when there is a release anyways, what use is this, especially if it produces false negatives?

It's really frustrating to do by the way, because apparently my "config.guess" is too old, but when I download a recent one from upstream and place it in `config/` it just gets deleted again when I run `./bootstrap`.  So I have to manually edit `./bootstrap` to not do that in order to build the tarball.  Can't the release manager just do that?
