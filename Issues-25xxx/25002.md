Please have a look, the branch is up and accessible.
The main objective of Ear Decomposition is to decompose the graph into cycles and chains that can be used to study properties of graph.

Jens algorithm:
1. Construct a depth-first search (dfs) spanning tree T of G ;
2. Traverse in Spanning Tree using G-T non-tree edges.

Potential Applications:
1. A graph G is biconnected if and only if it has an open ear decomposition.
2. A graph G is factor-critical if and only if G has an odd ear decomposition.
3. Verification to check if graph is 2-edge connected.


P.S : For the first step, we not only need tree but also some extra information which will be used in Tree traversal because of this I didn't use the existing DFS function and created my own.

Please let me know what more I can do to improve the code performance.

Welcome to Sagemath and thank you for this contribution.

There is no need to add a new file. This method should be inside `graph.py`.

Note that you don't need a class. You can define local methods inside a method like:

```
def my_function(G):
    def DFS(G, u):
        some code

    for u in G:
        DFS(G, u)
```
The local method can access local data list/dict, etc.

Some (unordered) comments.

- Please use the same indentation style than for other methods.

- in the name of variables: `vertice` -> `vertices`

- instead of `visited_vertice` you could name this dictionary `seen`. A matter of choice.
- `traverse_visited_vertice` could simply be `traversed` ?
- why using a list for `count` ? it's only an integer, right ? If I understand well, you use it to store in `value` the index of vertex v in the list `time_of_visit`, i.e., the order in which vertices are visited by DFS. So, we have:

```
value = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(time_of_visit)}
```

- instead of `time_of_visit`, you could use `order` of `dfs_order`. Could be (at least for me) easier to understand, especially since `time_of_visit[4]` is a vertex, not a time.

- why are you introducing variable `graph` instead of using `self` ?

- `n = graph.num_verts()` -> `n = self.order()`  I prefer this way, but both are working. Also, I'm not sure you really need the extra variable `n`, but it's a detail.

- since `graph.py` is for undirected graphs only, you can remove `if graph.is_directed(): raise ValueError("Graph must be undirected")`

- `if not graph.is_connected():` why ? can't we decompose the connected components of the graph ?

- `if(n<3):` -> `if n < 3:`

- `Please input a undirected connected graph with number of vertices > 2` -> `ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3` could be better. 

- `vertices = graph.get_vertices().keys()` -> `vertices = graph.vertices()` is the correct method. 

- the only interest of the `DFS` method is to record the parent of a vertex in a DFS order. If so, please add it in the description of the DFS method.

- when you write comments like `#make v are `, please add a space after `#`. `# make v are` is easier to read.

- I'm not sure to understand method `traverse`. Please add description.
- In the `while True` loop, you should start by `chain.append(pointer)`. No need to have it 3 times since you do it in all cases.
- why using the term `pointer` ?

- `for i in range(n):` -> `for u in time_of_visit:` 


I understand that I'm asking a lot of modifications, and I will ask for more, but it is very important to have an easy to read code, so that others can go inside an correct/improve parts if needed.

Yes, actually I always have a habit of adding some extra pieces of information in variable names, but seen and traversed are more meaningful than current ones.

Yes

graph gives more readability, now onwards I will use self to access input graph.  \\
Reference: treewidth() function in graph.py

I thought I will be using number of vertices value very often so I stored it in a variable, instead of calling  graph.num_verts() but now it's of no use. \\

Yes graph.py is for undirected graphs, it's mentioned at the top, I have updated the code.

Yes we can do it, updated.

Okay.

`graph.vertices()` will return a dict \\
`{'11': None, '10': None, '12': None, '1': None, '0': None, '3': None, '2': None, '5': None, '4': None, '7': None, '6': None, '9': None, '8': None}` \\
where as `graph.get_vertices().keys()` will give me all the keys of the dict i.e a list of vertices. \\
`['11', '10', '12', '1', '0', '3', '2', '5', '4', '7', '6', '9', '8']`

Should not since in graph.py, the methods are for Graph, and so not directed. It's different in `generic_graph.py` of course.

Read carefully what I wrote.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sage: print G.get_vertices()
{0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None, 5: None, 6: None, 7: None, 8: None, 9: None}
```
and in a loop it's better to use `G.vertex_iterator()`, `G.neighbor_iterator(u)`, `G.edge_iterator()`, etc. to avoid building the list before iterating on it.

Quick comments before going to a meeting :(

- the test `if(pointer==start):` is useless due to previous test `if(traversed[pointer])`

- in if statements, don't add (..). It's not needed when there is a unique condition.

- in the `for v in vertices:` loop, I fear that if the graph is not connected, you might visit again all previously treated components. Please check. May be you have to initialize some variables locally (i.e., not seen) to work only on the connected component.

Yes, you are correct, actually, in the algorithm, it's mention that traverses till you find start vertex or a visited vertex. As I am marking start as visited at first step, there is no use of `if(pointer==start):`. 
> 
> - in if statements, don't add (..). It's not needed when there is a unique condition.
 
Sure

> - in the `for v in vertices:` loop, I fear that if the graph is not connected, you might visit again all previously treated components. Please check. May be you have to initialize some variables locally (i.e., not seen) to work only on the connected component.
 
That case is taken care by seen list `if not seen[v]:`. \\
Let us suppose we have 2 connected components with 5 vertices in each component.\\
Component 1 = `[1,2,3,4,5]` \\
Component 2 = `[6,7,8,9,10]` \\
When first DFS(1) is run it will visit 4 vertices and mark it as seen .i.e `[1,2,3,4,5]`. So those 5 vertices can't be used again to call `DFS(v)`. \\
When vertice 6 comes it will call DFS(6), which will visit remaining 4 vertices and mark it as seen.\\
By this, all the vertices and connected components are covered, with extra cost(`if not seen[v]`), running on all vertices. i.e. `for v in vertices` \\
P.S: seen is not reinitialized after DFS call.

Yes, you are correct, I should reset dfs_order after using it.
It will save time and force to find chains in current dfs_tree instead of going back to the previous dfs_tree and find none.

Indentation: in general, we use 4 spaces for the indentation. Please update the code accordingly.

I propose some modifications in the DFS method. For instance using an iterator over the neighbors, etc.

```
def DFS(v):
    """
    Depth first search step from vertex v. 
    """
    seen[v] = True
    dfs_order.append(v)
        
    # Explore the neighbors of v
    for u in self.neighbor_iterator(v):
        if not seen[u]:
            # Set the parent of u in DFS tree as v and continue exploration
            parent[u] = v
            DFS(u)
```

in method `traverse`:
- you can do `chain = [start]`
- `if(traversed[pointer]):` -> `if traversed[pointer]:`

You use a dictionary for seen and for traversed. This is fine. Note however that you could use sets instead (not list). That is, testing `u in seen` or `seen[u]` is the same, and one should be as fast as the other. The advantage of using sets is that you don't need to initialize them (a very minor speed up). You then have to use `seen.add(u)` instead of `seen[u] = True`.

You initialize `parent[vertices[0]] = -1`. This is not a good idea since `-1` could be a vertex.

```
sage: G = Graph([(-1, -2)])
sage: -1 in G
True
```
You can either initialize the parent to itself or to `None`.

The next step will be to polish the documentation of the method, the examples and the tests.
For instance:
- `This module implements the function for computing the Ear Decomposition of undirected graphs.` -> `Return the Ear decomposition of the graph`
- Then, with a blank line separation, it is important to add explanation of what is ear decomposition.
- the terms input, output, examples should be capitalized (see other methods)
- Since the method can raise errors, we must have specific doctests for that  (see other methods)

I use sublime text editor(https://www.sublimetext.com/), which shows me that all the other functions uses 2 spaces, sure I will use vim and update it to 4 spaces.

Okay

I don't have any knowledge about doctests, currently, I am going through sage doc http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html, please let me know if any other better document is available for doctests.

I will update you as soon as I complete these modifications.

`parent[vertices[0]] = None` \\
As first non-tree edge will be from first `vertices[0]` and in the next step `traversed.add(start)` it will be marked as traversed, it doesn't matter whether its parent value is initialized or not as its parent value won't be used.

Definition, Wikipedia link and Reference is added.

Doctests:
Example1: g is simple undirected Graph. \\
Example2: g is disconnected graph with one component order < 3 \\
Example3: g is disconnected graph with 2 components, both components order > 3. \\
Example4: G is Looped multi-graph on 7 vertices and H is Graph on 7 vertices, both generates the same result. \\
Example5: g is disconnected graph with vertices as strings, not as numbers. \\
Example6: g is an empty graph. \\

Please let me know if any more example needs to be added, I have one doubt many function in graph.py has ``@`doc_index("...")` what does it mean? and if I need to add ``@`doc_index()` to `ear_decomposition()` function, what files I need to changes.

- comments must be formatted in 80 columns mode. Some code editors ease this formatting.

- `Return the Ear decomposition of the graph` -> `Return an Ear decomposition of the graph` I just realized that the decomposition is not unique...

- `An ear of an undirected graph G is a path P where the two endpoints of the path may coincide, but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of P has degree two in P.` -> `An ear of an undirected graph `G` is a path `P` where the two endpoints of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of P has degree two in `P`.`  This way, G and P will be in latex mode. Furthermore, move the definition of an ear before the definition of an ear decomposition.

- References should be placed in file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`. Use the same style than for other references.

- Then you can add: `This method implements the linear time algorithm presented in [Sch2013]_`

- `A nested list representing the cycle and chains of input graph G.` -> `A nested list representing the cycles and chains of the ear decomposition of the graph.`

- about examples: what is the purpose of each of these examples ?

- you should use the following structure for examples.

```
EXAMPLES:

Ear decomposition of an outer plananr graph of order 13::

    sage: g = Graph('LlCG{O@?GBOMW?')
```
   I have turned your graph to a graph6 string for compactness.

- What's the expected behavior of the method on multigraphs ?

- You could add a simple example with a non connected graph. 

- We might have an issue with non connected graph, for instance with `g = Graph(4)` or `g = Graph([(0,1), (1,2)])`. Any idea on how to handle these cases ?

- I don't like the block with the description of all variables / methods. I would prefer to scatter definitions where they belong: inside the methods for instance.

-  ``@`doc_index("...")` is used for automatic inclusion of the method into the lists of methods implemented in this file. You can see the list when looking at the html documentation. 
  You just have to add ``@`doc_index("Connectivity, orientations, trees")`

- how difficult would it be to extend this method for directed graphs ?

Yes, ear decomposition is not unique, it depends on DFS Tree and process of non-tree edges.

It's a non connected graph, in which one component is will have one edge i.e 12-13(12 & 13 are vertices).
When we do ear decomposition 12-13 vertices won't be available in any of the chains as 12-13 is a tree edge.

To the best of my knowledge, the current algorithm can't be used because of the following reasons. \\
1. When we take DFS tree of a directed connected graph, there is a chance of getting a cross edge from one subtree to another subtree, which is not a case in the undirected connected graph. \\
2. We use non-tree edges in DFS tree of an undirected graph, bottom-up traversal, which may not be possible in the current algorithm for a directed graph. \\
We can try few ways to overcome these problems but can't say whether the output represents ear decomposition or not. (I am open to any suggestions.)

I think you are in 90 columns format. The counting includes the white spaces at the left.
The same must be done for input, etc.

First, this is a connected graph but not a biconnected graph.
I suggest using simpler examples like this for non connected graphs

```
sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(3) + graphs.CycleGraph(4)
```
or this for connected but not biconnected

```
sage: g = graphs.BullGraph()
```
or for multigraph with a loop

```
sage: g = graphs.BullGraph()
sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: g.add_edges(g.edges())
sage: g.allow_loops(True)
sage: u = g.random_vertex()
sage: g.add_edge(u, u)
```

Can you clarify the definition for non connected graphs: should the method return a decomposition of each connected component or [] ? in particular, what if a connected component is of order < 3 since the ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order >= 3 ?

I'm not aware of existing algorithms (if any). If an algorithm has already been proposed, we can add it. If not, we can skip this question.

The graphs(order < 3) will have either isolated single node which plays no role in decomposition or 2 nodes with multiple edges in between them which is same as `v1 - v2` as only one edge is present no cycle or chain is possible.
To be more formal, if an undirected graph has n-1 edges or no non-tree edges left after DFS traversal then ear decomposition of such graph/components will be empty.

I turned the ticket to "needs review". Otherwise I will never be able to give positive review ;)

- `presented in [Sch2013].` -> `presented in [Sch2013]_.`  This is the way to cite a reference with sphynx.

- `outer plananr` -> `outer planar`

- `g = g = graphs.CubeGraph(2)` remove one of the `g = `

- `Ear decomposition of a disconnected graph of order 17::` again, this graph IS connected but not biconnected. If the goal of this test is to show the behavior on a connected graph with 2 biconnected blocks, a simpler example (i.e., that one can understand without plotting the graph etc.) could be

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_cycle([0,1,2])
sage: G.add_edge(0,3)
sage: G.add_cycle([3,4,5,6])
```

- add an empty line after `TESTS::`

- `g=Graph([])` -> `g = Graph()`  and no need for the line `sage: g`, we know it's the empty graph.

- `ValueError("Ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3.")` -> `ValueError("ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3")` no capital letter at the beginning of the message, and no point at the end. It's not unified in Sagemath, but it will slowly be modified.

- `self.order()<3` -> `self.order() < 3`   It's a coding recommendation (PEP...).


When at check the branch [u/saiharsh/EarDecomposition](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff?id2=9bf9f05f1f56d2e75439c2d2169459c3dfc2c0a3&id=c5c8fcab58e8c504cfc839e393ab28cb5bc40dc7), I see

Please carefully check your code before pushing a commit.
- `Ear decomposition of a disconnected graph of order 17::` but the example is different. The text could be `Ear decomposition of a connected but not biconnected graph::`

I have additional comments:
- `Ear decomposition of multigraph(g) is same as ear decomposition on simple graph(g)::` could be `The ear decomposition of a multigraph with loops is the same as the ear decomposition of the underlying simple graph::`

- Instead of 

```
sage: h = copy(g)
sage: h.allow_multiple_edges(False)
sage: h.allow_loops(False)
```
  you can use `sage: h = g.to_simple()`

- When I checkout your code, I see:

Could you please say why it's saying, build failed on patchbot, where I am able to successfully build in my system.

When I see build failed log of patchbot,

Sage build/upgrade complete! \\
fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory

I found that it's able to build but can't read some files. 

Could you please have a look and please let me know, is there any issue from my side?

The problem is independent from your patch.

Concerning your ticket.
- there are remaining trailing white spaces, for instance at the end of line `of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where otherwise no `. Please check carefully.

- line `This method implements the linear time algorithm presented in [Sch2013]_.` must be break since it ends on column 81.

- in the description of the `traverse` method, you must add a space after `G-T`.

I saw that the last version of networkx contains `chain_decomposition` which should be similar to this algorithm. Unfortunately we don't have the last version in sagemath so we can't do the comparison.

This branch does contain a directory named git-trac-command. It should be removed.

`@`dimpase, `@`dcoudert \\
I thought it's a file, which was created by me and I was searching in src folder.
I found that folder and deleted it.
Please let me know if any more changes are required.

most likely you were doing `git commit -a` - i.e. commit all the changes and all the new files - and thus you committed too much.
Great care must be exercised while using `-a` switch,
Yes, sometimes it is handy, but sometimes it leads to such SNAFU's.

Sure, I will keep that in mind before making any new commits in future.
I always try to run git status before committing, most likely it happend when I did my initial commits.
