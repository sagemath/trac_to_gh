Right now, `is_abelian()` fails for relative number fields as it calls `is_galois()` which is set to fail for relative number fields.

One can check if it is abelian by looking at `automorphisms()` and I was wondering if there was a better way to do this. Failing that, I think I could implement that approach to checking if an extension is abelian.

(I proposed a wrong implementation in a previous version.)

Keywords: relative number fields, abelian extensions
