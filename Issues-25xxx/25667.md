Currently (as of Sage 8.3.beta6), for some reason #25548 keeps the various Sage notebooks from behaving as needed.  We should revert the `src/sage/all.py` part until we get that figured out.

Details: `sage -n` or other launch of Sage notebook currently brings up the "SageNBExport" notebook, which allows conversion of sagenb worksheets to Jupyter.  One option on that page is to simply go to the old sagenb notebook; however, with #25548, that fails to actually open a browser window with the sagenb home page.  I'm not sure whether it is an authentication/token error or something else, but in any case it does not work even though the terminal indicates things are working normally behind the scenes.

Given that even if/when we switch to Jupyter for all notebook default people will still want the export functionality available, this should definitely be fixed.

How about just removing that `option on that page is to simply go to the old sagenb notebook`? An explanation how one should instead explicitly start `sagenb` is already there.

For the sake of argument, if one did remove that option as suggested in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) one could give very explicit instructions as currently at http://localhost:8888/sagenb/www/run-sagenb.html but I don't know that I would recommend that yet because it is the only way to access sagenb "for dummies" at this point outside the Mac app.
