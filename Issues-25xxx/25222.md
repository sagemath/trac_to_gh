The function `has_internet` in `doctest/external.py` doesn't work, at least on OS X, because it runs these commands:

```
sage: from six.moves import urllib
sage: urllib.request.urlopen("http://www.sagemath.org",timeout=1)

It seems that the default useragent supplied by urllib isn't liked:

```
sage: from six.moves import urllib
sage: url="http://www.sagemath.org"
sage: request = urllib.request.Request(url)
sage: request.add_header('User-Agent',"my browser 1.0")
sage: page = urllib.request.urlopen(request)
<no problem>
```
If I don't specify a user agent I get a 403 as well. The error response indicates cloudflare doesn't like the "browser signature". Any User-agent starting with `Python-urllib` is apparently not liked.

Oh, side effect (but this was already the case): do we run this as part of normal doctesting/installing etc.? The logs of the server should give a very easy list of IP addresses where this command has most likely run, by searching for the user agent (previously `Python-urllib`, now `sage-doctest`). That's just a consequence of accessing the internet in a function.

The behaviour is now:

- with `sage -t src/sage/doctest/external.py`, `has_internet` is not tested.

- with `sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/doctest/external.py`, `has_internet` is tested and the result is checked to be `True`.

(the previous behaviour was that everytime the doctest was run, there was a connection to sagemath via cloudflare, but no error could be reported, so it was doubly wrong).
