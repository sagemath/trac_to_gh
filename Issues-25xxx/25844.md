In short: pycrypto is no longer maintained, but also no longer used in Sage.

We should stop shipping it.

If needed, pycryptodome could serve as a replacement.

In this [sage-packaging discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-packaging/rynI5UjHFqs/discussion), FranÃ§ois Bissey, who maintains
Sage-on-Gentoo, reports that

> pycrypto is dead upstream and contains unfixed security bugs.


and considers removing it for Gentoo.

Antonio Rojas, who packages Sage for Arch Linux, says it was already
removed from Arch Linux:

The [latest pycrypto on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/#history)
is release 2.6.1 from 17 Oct 2013.

It's an optional dependency, and I think we're actually removing openid from sagenb as well, since it no longer works on Python 3.

Well in Gentoo python-openid doesn't depend on it. May be it is an optional runtime dependency?
In any case I am all for removing it now. Shaves a few bytes from the release tarball, smaller build/pkg folder what's not to love :)
