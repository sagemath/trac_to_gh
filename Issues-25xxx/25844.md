In short: pycrypto is no longer maintained, but also no longer used in Sage.

We should stop shipping it.

If needed, pycryptodome could serve as a replacement.

More detail below.

In this [sage-packaging discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-packaging/rynI5UjHFqs/discussion), FranÃ§ois Bissey, who maintains
Sage-on-Gentoo, reports that

> pycrypto is dead upstream and contains unfixed security bugs.

and considers removing it for Gentoo.

Antonio Rojas, who packages Sage for Arch Linux, says it was already
removed from Arch Linux:

> AFAIK pycrypto wasn't used by sagenb itself, but only via twisted,
> and they switched to cryptography in 16.0 [1]. Anyhow, secure
> sagenb works fine here without pycrypto.

The [latest pycrypto on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/#history)
is release 2.6.1 from 17 Oct 2013.

This
[message from Fri 21 Jul 2017 19:21:01 UTC](https://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/2017/000900.html)
on the
[pycrypto mailing list](https://lists.dlitz.net/pipermail/pycrypto/)

It's an optional dependency, and I think we're actually removing openid from sagenb as well, since it no longer works on Python 3.

If it wasn't used in sage in the first place and just stuff in `build` is modified, it shouldn't make a difference to packagers either way. We (at least I and pretty sure the others too) don't use anything from `build/pkgs`.

That doesn't mean I have anything against including this in 8.3, just clarifying.

> Grepping through my source tree: I have pycrypto listed as a dependency of python-openid, which is a dependency of sagenb. Is that the dependency that is not actually used?

Well in Gentoo python-openid doesn't depend on it. May be it is an optional runtime dependency?
In any case I am all for removing it now. Shaves a few bytes from the release tarball, smaller build/pkg folder what's not to love :)

Yeah I agree. In nix the `python-openid` package wasn't accepted into the main tree anyways. It is only used as a dependency for sage(nb), since it has the same problem `pycrypto` has (unmaintained, known problems).
