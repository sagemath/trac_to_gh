Could you try writing a standalone C++ program that replicates this?
To me it looks as if it's a basic issue with using Boost's API.

Excellent news.

I had a look at your code. Some comments:
- Instead of `Uses Boost to compute the blocks and cut vertices of the input graph.`, I would rather use `Compute the blocks and cut vertices of the graph.`. Then you can add a short text saying that this method uses the implementation available in boost of Tarjan's algorithm.

- In the method implemented in `generic_graph.py`, we consider the graph as undirected, and loops or multiple edges are ignored. In your implementation, I'm not sure what happens if you give a directed graph with symmetric edges (i.e., `[(0,1), (1,0)]`). It might be considered as multiple edges for the underlying undirected graph. Please check what is mandatory and how to cope with this at low cost.

- `cdef dict vertex_to_int = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(g.vertices())}` is apparently not used, so you may remove it.

- `result_blocks = []` -> `cdef list result_blocks = []` ? and the same for `result_cut` ?

- You should define a new variable with value `len(result)-1` as you use this several times.

- Why do you need to do `result[i] = list(set(result[i]))` ?

- Can't we find a faster method to identify articulation points than calling the boost method which itself calls the biconnected components method ? For instance, assume you have an array of booleans initialized to False. Then you iterate over all biconnected components. If a vertex has already been seen, it is necessarily an articulation points and you can store it. Otherwise, you mark it as seen. 

  At the end of this loop, vertices that have not been seen are the isolated vertices you are looking for ;) Actually, what if the graph has 2 disjoints biconnected components ? will the boost method find both or only one ?

So the Boost `biconnected_components()` method assigns an integer to each edge denoting which biconnected component it belongs to. I am iterating through every edge, and adding the incident vertices to the corresponding biconnected components. If a vertex which is not a cut vertex has more than one edge incident, then we will come across this vertex atleast twice. Hence we need to store the vertices of each biconnected component as a set. Instead of doing this in `boost_interface.cpp`, I am doing it in `boost_graph.pyx`.

Yes, this is a very good idea. Thank you. I will implement this. And yes, if the graph has 2 disjoint subgraphs, Boost method computes the articulation points and biconnected components of both. Only problem was isolated vertices, which will be solved by your method.

Another point I wanted to ask - is it required to sort the vertices in each biconnected component? The Sage implementation does this but I wasn't sure if it is necessary.

You should add some comments in the code to explain it. When I read the code, my understanding is that boost put in `result[i]` the list of vertices of block `i` and that this list may contains repetitions that you remove doing `list(set(result[i]))`.

Then, since `result[i]` is a list, the for loop should be

```
for z in result[i]:
    result_temp.append(int_to_vertex[<int> z])
```
with z of the right type.

or if you combine with previous instruction, you can do

```
for z in set(result[i]):
    result_temp.append(int_to_vertex[<int> z])
```
the advantage is that you don't modify `result[i]`...

  
You should also do something for the loop `for i in range(len(result[len(result)-1])):` like `for z in result[len(result)-1]:`.

> Another point I wanted to ask - is it required to sort the vertices in each biconnected component? The Sage implementation does this but I wasn't sure if it is necessary. 


No, it's not mandatory. We did it in the Sage implementation because it makes it easier to read when you print the solution, but, as for the list of vertices which are sorted, it adds extra computations for little benefit.

We can do something smarter, combining the loops and the ideas ;)

Let `vertex_status` be an array of `n` integers initialized to `-1`. The idea is that if `vertex_status[v] == -1`, the vertex has not been seen yet. If `vertex_status[v] == i`, then `v` belongs to the ith block. If `vertex_status[v] != -1 and vertex_status[v] < i` then `v` belongs to at least 2 blocks so is an articulation point.

```
for i in range(len(result)):
    result_temp = []
    for v in result[i]:
        if vertex_status[v] == -1:
            # First time we see this vertex
            result_temp.append(int_to_vertex[<int> v])
            vertex_status[v] = i

        elif vertex_status[v] < i:
            # This vertex also belongs to another block, so it is an articulation point
            result_cut.append(int_to_vertex[<int> v])
            # We change the block number to avoid adding it twice as an articulation point in case this vertex is repeated in the current block
            vertex_status[v] = i

        # no else. If the vertex is already in this block, it is a repetition and we simply skip it

    result_blocks.append(result_temp)

# Finally, we deal with isolated vertices
for i in range(g.order()):
    if vertex_status[i] == -1:
        result_blocks.append([int_to_vertex[<int> i]])
```

do not forget to declare variables `i` and `v`.

My bad, I didn't pay keen attention to your solution, so I was storing the status of the vertices of Sage graph in `vertex_status` instead of the Boost graph, and hence the confusion. I have changed it now.

Could you:
- add an empty line after `Computes the blocks and cut vertices of the graph.`

- At the end of the method, you can simply do

```
-    result_tup = [result_blocks, result_cut]
-    return tuple(result_tup)
+    return (result_blocks, result_cut)
```

and don't forget to set the ticket to "needs review" when you think it is ready.

There is a doctest failure. In the test you expect `TypeError: the input must be a Sage Graph` but in the code you raise `TypeError("the input must be a Sage graph")`. So use either `sage` or `Sage`.

Recall that you should test your code and the doctest.
- `./sage -tp src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx` will run the doctests on the file
- `./sage -tp src/sage/graphs/` will run the doctests of all files in the directory


Another issue is that we may add multiple times a cut vertex to the list of cut vertices. 

```
sage: G = graphs.StarGraph(5)
sage: G.blocks_and_cut_vertices(algorithm="Tarjan_Boost")
([[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5]], [0, 0, 0, 0])
```
To avoid that, you can change the type of `result_cut` to set (`cdef set result_cut = set()`), and then return `list(result_cut)`
