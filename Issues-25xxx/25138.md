Of the 8 packages that explicitly depend on pkgconf, (barely) the majority of them list pkgconf as an order-only prerequisite, which makes sense.  However, these three packages did not, albeit not for any particular reason I can tell.

I don't think updating pkgconf should necessitate rebuilding any of these packages and their dependencies.

I also noticed that `patch` is a dependency of `pkgconf`, which makes sense in case there is ever a need to apply patches to `pkgconf`, but it need only be an order-only dependency.
