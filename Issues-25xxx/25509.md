We currently have the following elegant way to produce immutable graphs:

```
sage: set([Graph(i) for i in range(5)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: This graph is mutable, and thus not hashable. Create an immutable copy by `g.copy(immutable=True)`
sage: set([Graph(i, immutable=True) for i in range(5)])
{Graph on 0 vertices,
 Graph on 1 vertex,
 Graph on 2 vertices,
 Graph on 3 vertices,
 Graph on 4 vertices}
```
The aim of this ticket is to have the same for other objects, in particular vectors and matrices.

It would avoid introducing a variable just to make this adjustment. This can simplify code by more than just one line. Consider, for example, list/set/dict comprehensions and compare

```
S = set()
for x in some_list:
    v = vector(x)
    v.set_immutable()
    S.add(v)
```
to

```
S = set(vector(x, immutable=True) for x in some_list)
```

It would avoid introducing a variable just to make this adjustment. This can simplify code by more than just one line. Consider, for example, list/set/dict comprehensions and compare

```
S = set()
for x in some_list:
    v = vector(x)
    v.set_immutable()
    S.add(v)
```
to

```
S = set(vector(x, immutable=True) for x in some_list)
```

> Are there other examples (than graphs) that do it with keywords?


I did a quick research. Apart from `Graph` and `DiGraph`, I found:
- `Sequence` and `PolynomialSequence` having an `immutable=True/False` switch
- `SimplicialComplex` accepts both `is_mutable` and `is_immutable`
- `Constellation` accepts `mutable`.

Apart from `vector` and `matrix`, the only classes I found having a `set_immutable` method, but no corresponding switch in the constructor are the following:

- the abstract classes `ClonableElement` and `Mutability`
- `Matrix_cyclo_dense` and `LatinSquare`, passing the `set_immutable` command to its associated matrix
- `ToricLattice_quotient_element`, having a `set_mutable` method, which "does nothing, it is introduced for compatibility purposes only".

Just like `@`mantepse, I would prefer `vector` and `matrix` to have such switches. Is there a striking argument why they shouldn't?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks. Especially the example illustrated to me, why such a switch makes sense. Maybe you could add this example to the description of the ticket.

I'm not into matrices or vectors too much (I never contributed to them). So if I'm going to agree to adding a switch, I want to know, that it is useful. I never had a striking reason against adding the `immutable` switch, but one needs at least one argument on the pro side as well (otherwise we could add tons of almost useless switches for very special cases).

Some more remarks:
- You should specify the error in the doctest:

```diff
-        sage: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).
+        ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).
```
- Maybe you can simplify the construction

```diff
-    if kwds.pop('immutable', False):
-        M = MatrixArgs(*args, **kwds).matrix()
-        M.set_immutable()
-        return M
-
-    return MatrixArgs(*args, **kwds).matrix()
+    immutable = kwds.pop('immutable', False)
+    M = MatrixArgs(*args, **kwds).matrix()
+    if immutable:
+        M.set_immutable()
+    return M
```
  The reason I'm suggesting it: It is clearer, what the switch immutable does. It doesn't effect the construction of the matrix, it is just setting the matrix immutable, after the construction.
- I find it strange, when the comments preceding examples end with `. ::`. However, it seems to work well with sphinx: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/free_module.html

Otherwise, this looks fine modulo the changes suggested by Markus Wageringel. Maybe one could add tiny tests for each case of the early returns.

Thank you, I only tested the vector file. I fixed it.

> Also I think, error message should not end with a period.


Could you be more specific? I don't think I introduced any error message.

> I think returning `a` with `vector(a)` is definitely not the desired behavior. E.g. `list`, `matrix` and `graph` return a copy in this case. So one would expect `vector` to behave the same.
