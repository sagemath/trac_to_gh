This updates packages that do nothing more than copy some files to use `sdh_install` from #25039:

* combinatorial_designs
* graphs
* pari_galdata
* pari_seadata_small
* polytopes_db
* threejs

Excluded jmol from this since it's slightly more complicated, and would conflict with #25026.

Keywords: destdir combinatorial_designs graphs pari_galdata pari_seadata_small polytopes_db threejs
