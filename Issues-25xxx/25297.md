```
Test case:

Create a multivariate quotient ring, construct an ideal, extract a generator from the ideal, and ensure that it can be `lift`ed back to the original ring:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: SE.<xbar,ybar> = R.quotient(x^2 + y^2 - 1)
sage: P = ideal(xbar,ybar)
sage: P.0
xbar
sage: P.0.parent()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
sage: P.0.lift()
x
sage: P.0.lift().parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

Now convert the ideal to Singular, then back to Sage, and try to do the lift again:

```
sage: P2 = P._singular_().sage()
sage: P2
Ideal (x, y) of Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
sage: P2.0
x
sage: P2.0.parent()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
sage: P2.0.lift()
x
sage: P2.0.lift().parent()
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
```

The problem is related to how a QuotientRingElement is constructed:

```
Help on class QuotientRingElement in module sage.rings.quotient_ring_element:

class QuotientRingElement(sage.structure.element.RingElement)
 |  An element of a quotient ring `R/I`.
 |  
 |  INPUT:
 |  
 |  - ``parent`` - the ring `R/I`
 |  
 |  - ``rep`` - a representative of the element in `R`; this is used
 |    as the internal representation of the element
 |  
 |  - ``reduce`` - bool (optional, default: True) - if True, then the
 |    internal representation of the element is ``rep`` reduced modulo
 |    the ideal `I`
```

Notice that `rep` should be in the cover ring, but the Singular conversion function builds it in the quotient ring itself.

Another problem with this code is that it assumes that any QuotientRing_generic is implemented using MPolynomial_polydict.

This patch uses the default element constructors of both the QuotientRing and the MPolynomialRing to correctly convert quotient ring elements back from Singular to Sage.

There is a single change to a regression test, where a Singular element is now reduced modulo the quotient ring's ideal when it gets converted to Sage (as it should be, in my opinion).

I couldn't simplify the test case any further, because just converting a quotient ring element to Singular and back to Sage moved it into the cover ring:

```
sage: xbar._singular_().sage()
x
sage: xbar._singular_().sage().parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

I think this might be a separate bug.

Also, should the term "cover ring" or "ambient ring" be preferred?  QuotientRing implements the method `cover_ring` and makes `ambient` a copy of it.

Brent, the reasoning is that it is an extra Python function call, which is relatively expensive compared to an `isinstance`. Plus we eventually hope to do away with most/all of the `is_Foo()` functions.
