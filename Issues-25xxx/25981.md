There are several problems on Python 3 involving ordering elements of heterogeneous collections, particularly in objects such as sets and graphs.

This issue has already come up several times in the Python 3 port usually with some ad-hoc fix.  For sorting, sometimes it's straightforward to come up with a reasonable sort key.  Other times it's not obvious, or leads to ugly code (lots of try/excepts, etc.)

One possibility I've brought up before is inspired by the `pprint` implementation on Python 3:  `pprint` by default orders the output of collections such as dicts and sets.  On Python 3 they had to deal with this issue of arbitrary types no longer being ordered, so `pprint` has an internal helper called `_safe_key` on which this `SafeSortable` class is inspired, which serves as a wrapper around objects giving them Python 2-style sorting semantics.

This is just a proof-of-concept, and I think there are various issues to work out:

1. Performance comparison, especially on Python 2.  Adding `key=SafeSortable` to sorts is unnecessary on Python 2 and probably only needlessly slows things down, though I'm not sure by how much.  This could also be avoided by building a Python 2 exception into the `SafeSortable.sort` helper method, and/or possibly making `type(SafeSortable).__call__` effectively a no-op.

2. Performance improvements on Python 3.  Even on Python 3 we can probably speed this up a lot, in particular by pooling `SafeSortable` instances similarly to what we do for `Integer`s.

3. Do we want to make the interface more flexible?  For example, do we always want Python 2 sorting semantics?  Would it also be useful to provide an optional custom fallback for two types that can't be compared naturally?

4. What about comparing compound objects, specifically tuples?  Do we want an API for applying `SafeSortable` recursively to the elements of tuples?  And what about other comparing other heterogeneous collections such as lists?  I think this would *probably* be useful (e.g. sorting key/value pairs from a dict), but I haven't settled on the API for that.

This obviously is a useful change.

Python2 compatibility is a wise behavior.

I only deplore that we need to import a new module, even a small one ..

<code>\`SafeSortable\`</code> doesn't cause failures to build, just typesetting in math mode as you note, so that proposed change is cosmetic. The failures come from <code>\`\`SafeSortable\`\`s</code>: the second <code>\`\`</code> is not recognized by Sphinx as ending a literal block: I'm guessing that Sphinx wants <code>\`\`</code> to either be preceded by or followed by a space.

By the way, I also see a doctest failure:

Regarding the doctest failure, I get

```
sage: 1 < 'a'
False
sage: int(1) < 'a'
True
```
Did you mean to use `int(1)` instead of 1?

```
sage: 1 < 'a'
True
```

Initially I wasn't sure why you would get False here, since the default Python 2 comparison actually sorts instances of numeric types (which I believe Sage's `Integer` is for this purpose), so both `Integer(1)` and `int(1)` should come before `'a'` and I'm not sure how you'd get any other result.  However, it turns out that `Integer.__richcmp__` given a RHS that is not obviously comparable to an int will fall back on the coercion model, which itself in this case has a default [richcmp implementation](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx?id=0e992df0fc4641339f9eb465252486ef88a56ebb#n1895) that as a last resort compares the two elements just by their ids, and that's what's happening in the case of comparing an `Integer` to a `str`.  This default comparison is rather unfortunate since it's rather non-deterministic.

I'm not sure what the best thing would be to do about this.  I'm tempted to take the Python 3 approach and remove this fallback nonsense comparison in favor of raising a `TypeError` if two objects don't have a sensible comparison implemented.
