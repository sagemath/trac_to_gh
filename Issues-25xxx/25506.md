I used the pynauty library (https://web.cs.dal.ca/~peter/software/pynauty/html/intro.html#), which has GPLv3+ license by the way, to interface with our pynauty package and use it to check for isomorphism and compute automorphisms through the standard sage methods.
In particular, I am actually copying the package from upstream, patching it and recompiling it, since pynauty wrappers require to be compiled with nauty's own source code.
A lot of modifications where required to make the transition from sage's own graph representation to one that nauty was able to understand.
At the moment this interface doesn't support arbitrary edge labels, but it supports multi-edge graphs through an helper function that converts them in equivalent single-edge graphs (http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Guide.html section 14) that I put in sage.graphs.multiedge for everyone to use.
The efficiency is not exactly spectacular, since the graph needs to be relabeled with labels going from 0 to n-1 (where n is the number of vertices), and thus a copy needs to be made and the relabel function needs to be called. If, by chance, the graph is already labelled in that way, there is an option to tell the interface not to relabel the graph. If the relabeling is found to be too inefficient, it could be implemented in the C++ part of the interface, but then a lot of the conversions done to return sensible results (i.e. return automorphism group generators listing the actual nodes' labels, and not arbitrary labels in {0..n-1}) would have to be moved too.
Modifications were made to also output results in the exact same format of the standard sage methods.

Last, I noted that a version of the same algorithm I used to convert multi-edged graphs to their single edge version was implemented in the Bliss module (but only for Bliss graphs), in #24924; it might be worth it to change it to use this more general version, if needs allow it.

Thanks for the contribution. 

I'm not expert in nauty or creating interfaces, but instead of creating a new file `multiedge_singledge_conversion.pyx` (which is a weird name), you should create a file `nauty.pyx` for the interface with nauty, or directly put this method into `sage_graph.patch`.
Furthermore, why are you adding  `from .multiedge import multiedge_to_singledge` to `src/sage/graphs/all.py` ? It's a very specific method, so I don't see why it should be added to global namespace.

Concerning the method itself, you don't need to convert the graph to a (slow and space consuming) dictionary. You can access the list of multiple edges of the graph with `G.multiple_edges()`. Furthermore, if the graph has multiple edges, you can get the list of distinct labels using `G.edge_label(0, 1)`

```
sage: G = Graph(multiedges=True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 2)])
sage: G.multiple_edges()
[(0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 2), (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 2)]
sage: G.edge_label(0, 1)
[2, 0]
sage: G.edge_label(1, 2)
[1]
```
Another issue is that you assume edge labels to be integers, but we can have floats, rationals, list, dict, etc.

It's clearly easier to use pynauty, but it's a petty we cannot convert the graph directly to the data structure used by nauty.

About the import, it's mostly due to experiments I've been running to understand how the importing works in sagemath.

You call `get_bits_list(label)` whic itself calls `bin(x)`. So if you give anything else than an integer, you get an error.

I see how that might be misleading, but I think I only call that function on a dictionary that I created, that associates each edge in the graph with its multiplicity, so I am sure that "label" is an int because that's the multiplicity of the edge

So the entire goal of this method is to account for the impossibility of managing multiple edges (and in the future, edge labels) in a graph with nauty. 
What it does is construct an auxiliary graph with n log k vertices, where k is the maximum multiplicity of the edges in the original graph, that has no multiple edges and with two peculiar characteristics:
-There is a subset of its vertices (returned by the method)  such that the auxiliary graph's automorphism group's action on them is the same as the one on the original graph (that is, if one keeps every vertex not in the subset in a separate partition, and then removes every mention of these additional vertices from the automorphism group of the auxiliary graph, the resulting automorphism group is equal to the original graph's automorphism group
-Given two (multi)graphs, they are isomorphic if and only if their auxiliary graphs are isomorphic

So right now it works with multiplicities, I am trying to find a way to include arbitrary edge labels, but since it's an auxiliary graph I didn't see the point in adding the edge labels. I can do it, but they would just become a nice ornament, not really used for anything (at least not in nauty).

So, I commented and added doctests. I run into a quite nasty bug though, which I couldn't really pinpoint or fix, I could just find a workaround.
I submitted two commits, the first adds the docs, the second "fixes" the bug, so you can check for yourself.
What happens is that, when running tests **only**, after any test checking for exception raising (such as the test in `automorphism_group()` that checks a `KeyError` is returned if a wrong partition is passed as a parameter), any call to `to_singledge()` ends in a segfault, caused by a call to `PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs(...)`. Again, the segfault is raised **only** in this specific circumstances.
I couldn't find a way to explain the error, but I could fix it by substituting that call with a call to `PyObject_CallMethod(...)`.
It's not necessary to make the code work, but if anyone has any insight on the cause (or on how to run gdb interactively on the c code of a third party package during a sage testing session), I'd be happy to hear it.
Let me know if there's anything wrong with the docs and doctests, since this is the first time I write them.

So, dimpase made me notice that the code I wrote had a few issues for people who don't actually have pynauty installed or even downloaded.
I modified the code so that there's no need to modify the upstream tarball anymore, thus it can simply be downloaded from https://web.cs.dal.ca/~peter/software/pynauty/pynauty-0.6.0.tar.gz and put in the upstream folder; still, could this tarball be added in the repositories, so that it can be downloaded automatically by sage?
After this, I also made the tests about pynauty optional, since I forgot the first time around.
Finally, now this interface supports both multiple edges and labelled edges, even at the same time (but having a multiple edge with different labels can produce weird results).
Right now there should not be any more issues with this branch, so I'll move on to another contribution; I'll leave it like this for a couple of days, so if anyone spots any errors I can fix them, then I'll ask for review, I hope.

The mega patch is my work, basically all the changes I made to pynauty so that it could interact with sage graphs directly, use multigraphs and labelled graphs, output automorphism groups in a decent format, etc.
Without it the package would be exactly like the one downloaded from upstream, which is good, but not really useful for Sage.
About the nauty source code part, basically the way pynauty was developed by its original creator is that it compiles its own version of nauty (and probably uses it internally, i'm not really sure), so it needs nauty's source code instead of already compiled executables; to do this, I take the source code out of Sage's nauty and use that to compile pynauty.

I have the following comments on method `remove_labels`:
- remove import of `floor`. Not used.
- remove import of `version_info` and method `getiterator` that you don't use.

- in the for loop to fill `edge_labels_dict`, I suggest to change it with

```
for el in edge_labels:
    if not el in edge_labels_dict:
        edge_labels_dict[el] = bin(counter)[2:][::-1]
        counter += 1
```
- then remove method `get_bits_list`
- rewrite

```
for u,v,label in G.edge_iterator():
    for idx, bit in enumerate(edge_labels_dict[label]):
        if bit == '1':
            newG.add_edge((u, idx), (v, idx))
```

In fact we use:

```
sage: list(enumerate("string"))
[(0, 's'), (1, 't'), (2, 'r'), (3, 'i'), (4, 'n'), (5, 'g')]
```

- Do you really need to set `loops=True` ? or can't you just do `loops=self.allows_loops()` to allow loops only if self allows loops ?

Sure, I don't see any particular upside to making this changes, but if you think they're for the better, I don't see any downsides either, so I made them.
The only one I kept out for the moment is the loops part, since I don't remember why precisely I set loops always to true, there might be some other reason not immediately obvious that I'm forgetting. I'll come back to that too in a few days.
