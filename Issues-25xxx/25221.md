On OS X, if 'make' runs successfully, then running 'make' again should do nothing, but in fact it builds many packages: patch, pkgconf, zlib, yasm, ....  I think that what is happening is that when gcc is required, the top-level configure file gets modified in the middle of the first make process (just after building gcc?), so the second make process sees a new configure file, runs it again, and something then triggers these rebuilds.

One effect of this is that `.BUILDSTART` can get rewritten in the middle of the build process, so inaccurate timings are reported at the end. I think this can be dealt with on another ticket, but it should be dealt with.

So for other tickets:

- only write `.BUILDSTART` once, even if we build gcc.
- possibly remove some `make` targets.
- document at least some of the others. The buildbots should not be using `make` targets that are undocumented.

(I still don't know why anyone would ever use `make start` instead of `make`: what is the difference between these?)

At least when I set up the buildbot, `make start` would build sage and then test that it starts.
