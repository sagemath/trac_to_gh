<a id='comment:16'></a>Still a long way to go.

I have removed all allusions to self-duality. While I can't exclude the possibility of a self-duality for FSym (though of course the Fundamental basis won't be orthogonal under that self-duality), there is no such thing implemented in the code.

This looks mis-documented; what should it actually say?

```
        def __getitem__(self, key):
            r"""
            Override the ``__getitem__`` method to allow passing of
            arguments to ``StandardTableau``.

            EXAMPLES:

            Construct the basis element indexed by a standard tableau by
            passing data that defines the standard tableau::
```

Some of the methods, particularly the coproduct of FQSym, look rather inefficient to me. I'm wondering if sometimes we can use FQSym instead, in a sufficiently smart way (reading words?).

Someone should take a look at the OOP here and see if it could use some backporting of the recent fixes from FQSym. Will it blow up if we define a second basis?

`FQSym` does not need a `_basis_name`; it can use `_realization_name()` as well.

We can add it when we need it. It is better to have more granular changes anyways. It means less maintenance and useless (or missing) tests.

<a id='comment:44'></a>My guess is `~_A` is causing the failure since `~` is the non-breaking space and instead you want `\sim_A`.

I think `\{1,2,3,\ldots}` in `to_packed_word` was taken care of in an earlier ticket.

The `{1, 2, ..., n}` in `from_finite_word` is fixed in #25141.

That is all I see on a manual look over.

<a id='comment:62'></a>So Darij was correct about the symptoms, but not about the source of the problem. The issue is that we were trying to reference F*Q*Sym, which we had forgotten to add to the documentation.

I made a few other changes. Most are just resolving links and trivial changes. The other significant change I did was move the entire CHAs subsection of `algebraic_combinatorics` to the CHAs header.

I have confirmed the pdf documentation does now build (well, I skipped the repl directory; I get that too, but that has nothing to do with this ticket). So if my changes are good, then positive review.
