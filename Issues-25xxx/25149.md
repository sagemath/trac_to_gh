Is there a specific reference whose notations you're following? Is it the paper that first introduced the algebra ([PoiReu95])?

And why do you speak of "self-dual" in `duality_pairing`, when you're defining FSym and FSym* as two distinct algebras? Are they isomorphic or not? (I regret I have never learnt much about this algebra.)

<div id="comment:16" align="right">comment:16</div>

Still a long way to go.

I have removed all allusions to self-duality. While I can't exclude the possibility of a self-duality for FSym (though of course the Fundamental basis won't be orthogonal under that self-duality), there is no such thing implemented in the code.

This looks mis-documented; what should it actually say?

```
        def __getitem__(self, key):
            r"""
            Override the ``__getitem__`` method to allow passing of
            arguments to ``StandardTableau``.

            EXAMPLES:

            Construct the basis element indexed by a standard tableau by
            passing data that defines the standard tableau::
```

Some of the methods, particularly the coproduct of FQSym, look rather inefficient to me. I'm wondering if sometimes we can use FQSym instead, in a sufficiently smart way (reading words?).

Someone should take a look at the OOP here and see if it could use some backporting of the recent fixes from FQSym. Will it blow up if we define a second basis?

Still need to ...

* review fsym.py until FreeSymmetricFunctions;

* remove the test file from the ticket (unless someone volunteers to write the tests!);

* possibly implement Schützenberger involutions on FSym and FQSym since it's easy and sort-of natural.

And of course, someone should look at my commits.

Just as a note, the test file will become more relevant once more CHA coercions are added as the `# non tested` tests are checking the commutative diagram property of the coercions.

Darij, actually looking at your [comment:35](#comment:35) more closely, if we are going to implement the Schützenberger anti-automorphisms for all three of those, then that could be one (or three) separate tickets. It probably would be better as at least a separate ticket from this.

New ticket #25326 is now open for the Schützenberger stuff. The tests file, while being less useful than it will eventually be, at least doesn't break anything. So, positive review.

My guess is `~_A` is causing the failure since `~` is the non-breaking space and instead you want `\sim_A`.

I think `\{1,2,3,\ldots}` in `to_packed_word` was taken care of in an earlier ticket.

The `{1, 2, ..., n}` in `from_finite_word` is fixed in #25141.

That is all I see on a manual look over.

I have corrected a few things I caught in the doc (sorry for not doing so at review time) and defensively replaced some """s by r"""s. Also, while at that, I've updated a few references to newer versions (modifying them whenever necessary); in particularly, [GriRei2014] and [GriRei16] now point to the same global reference.

I still can't docbuild the PDF on my machine though :(

That seems very strange to me. If that was true, why didn't the doc break on an earlier ticket when we introduced the chas subfolder? Why is this never done elsewhere (AFAIK)? Even if that was the fix, I really would like to understand why it fixes it.

So Darij was correct about the symptoms, but not about the source of the problem. The issue is that we were trying to reference F*Q*Sym, which we had forgotten to add to the documentation.

I made a few other changes. Most are just resolving links and trivial changes. The other significant change I did was move the entire CHAs subsection of `algebraic_combinatorics` to the CHAs header.

I have confirmed the pdf documentation does now build (well, I skipped the repl directory; I get that too, but that has nothing to do with this ticket). So if my changes are good, then positive review.
