The `test_safe_directory` function currently works by spawning a python subprocess and relying on the `sys_path_security-issue_16202.patch` being applied (https://bugs.python.org/issue16202).

That is not really necessary: This commit changes the implementation to use `os.stat` instead. That has several advantages:

- does not depend on the python patch
- saves the (small) overhead of forking a new python process
- is simpler / more obvious to implement

This patch changes behaviour. The security check implemented in the Python patch is more complicated that this simple check. It involves group permissions, umask...

This brings us to the main *advantage* of the subprocess approach: it's very simple to get the same behaviour as Python.

For reference: [here](https://gist.github.com/timokau/e3aa33a997e0f3296a9ba53972348031) is the relevant permission checking code. Some of that seems arbitrary to me, for example `/* Only keep group bit if the current group ID is the same as the group of "parent" */`. But it probably wouldn't be too hard to implement that logic in python.

But whats the value in that? Only sages python has that behaviour anyways and the upstream patch looks like a loosing battle.

Currently the result is that [debian](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/master/debian/patches/df-python_security.patch) and [gentoo](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-7.3-safepython.patch) (and nix) simply disable the test while arch just failes it.

I don't see it as a "battle". If upstream Python wants to continue shipping their Python with a huge security hole, it's their problem. That's how I see it.

Right, but if it makes packaging harder that makes it our problem, too. In the end its not really sages place to judge and test for that behaviour. I'm not suggesting to remove the patch from "sage-the-distribution", just that the doctests don't depend on it. In my opinion thats better than every distribution removing the test individually.

We should change not common behaviour, I think: if Python does not check that the current directory is safe in its built-in doctesting, we should not do that either; after all we're just a Python library. But I can imagine that some disagree.\n\nAnyway, we should not check that we are running on patched Python. So my proposal is to make this a Python3 check instead.",

Imho we should not depend on a patched Python in our doctesting.

I appreciate the patch to Python as such. Loading random modules from `.` is certainly something that many people are not aware of so it made sense to patch this upstream and to backport that patch to Sage-the-distribution.

I am not convinced that we should change Python's doctesting behaviour as such. We should change not common behaviour, I think: if Python does not check that the current directory is safe in its built-in doctesting, we should not do that either; after all we're just a Python library. But I can imagine that some disagree.

Anyway, we should not check that we are running on patched Python. So my proposal is to make this a Python3 check instead.
