should be
`+    Return the h-th transvectant of f and g.`
And same thing (Return) for all first lines of all functions and methods.

* `EXAMPLES::` is mis-indented in transvectant

* references should look like `[Cle1872]_` not like `_[Cle1872]`

* `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` must be followed by an empty line

* missing backquotes in `+        The \tau-covariant of the binary quintic as polynomial or as binary form.`

etc, etc. Please thoroughly check the documentation of your work.
