Add decomposition of poset to prime posets (or chains or antichains), i.e. kind of converse of `lexicographic_sum`.

This should be useful for optimizing dimension and jump number. However I suppose that this is also nice to have as public method.

Something like this, I suppose. 8.3rc0 is out, so target will be 8.4.

```
def decompose(self):
    """
    Decompose the poset to prime posets.

    A poset that is not prime can be expressed as a nontrivial
    lexicographic sum. This function decomposes the poset so that
    the index poset is as large as possible -- conversedly said, so
    that lexicographic summands are prime posets.

    Exceptions are chains and antichains. They are not decomposed;
    for example the 9-element chain could be written as the lexicographic
    sum of two 3-element chain using the 2-element chain as index poset.
    With this exception the decomposition is unique.

    OUTPUT:
        
    A list of posets `[T, P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{n-1}]`. Poset `T` is the
    index poset having integers `0, 1, \ldots, n-1` as
    elements. Posets `P_i` are either chains, antichains or prime posets.
    
    EXAMPLES:

    We create a lexicographic sum, decompose it back to parts and check
    by re-computing the sum::

        sage: V = Poset({1: [2, 3]})
        sage: N = Poset({1: [3, 4], 2: [4]})
        sage: C5 = posets.ChainPoset(5)
        sage: S3 = posets.StandardExample(3)
        sage: P = V.lexicographic_sum({1: N, 2: C5, 3: S3}); P
        Finite poset containing 12 elements
        sage: decomp = P.decompose()
        sage: decomp[0] == V
        True
        sage: decomp[1] == N
        True
        sage: decomp[0].lexicographic_sum(decomp[1:]).relabel(lambda x: x[0]) == P
        True

    .. SEEALSO::
        
        - :meth:~`lexicographic_sum`
        
    TESTS::
        
        sage: Poset().decompose()
        []
        sage: posets.StandardExample(4).decompose()  # prime poset
        [Finite poset containing 1 elements, Finite poset containing 8 elements]
    """
    H = self._hasse_diagram
    decomposition = H.transitive_closure().to_undirected().modular_decomposition()

    # First a trivial recursive decomposition.
    def rec_split(decomp, part_dict):
        if all(isinstance(x, int) for x in decomp[1]):
            part_dict[decomp[1][0]] = decomp[1]
