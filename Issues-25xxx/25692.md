Trying to call the permutation_group() method of an infinite `AbelianGroup` or `AdditiveAbelianGroup` group leads to a non-informative `TypeError` because GAP does not handle infinite permutation groups.

A better UI would be to check if the group is infinite, and raise a suitable error message.

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([0])
sage: H = AbelianGroup([0])
sage: G.permutation_group()
...
TypeError: Gap produced error output
Error, usage: Image(<map>), Image(<map>,<elm>), Image(<map>,<coll>)

   executing \$sage6:=Image(IsomorphismPermGroup(AbelianGroup([0])));;
```

LGTM. (I am not 100% certain it should be a `TypeError` over a `ValueError`, but that is probably bikeshedding.)
