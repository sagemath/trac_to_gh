This ticket makes `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work without environment variables set, or the current working directory to be something particular. 

It does that by 
- adding `SAGE_ROOT` to  `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config` (via `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`).
- adding code to the top of `sage-env` that determines `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` from the directory of itself.

 Currently, if I run the script $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage in my normal environment (where SAGE_ROOT is not set) then I get:

 Error: You must set the SAGE_ROOT environment variable or run this
 script from the SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ directory.
 Error setting environment variables by sourcing '/usr/local/sage/sage-git/local/bin/sage-env';
 possibly contact sage-devel (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel).

 If instead I run the script $SAGE_ROOT/sage a value for SAGE_ROOT is figured out and everything works 
 fine when called from my normal environment.

Likewise, a naive trial to start the GAP shipped by Sage fails:

```
$ /path/to/sagedir/local/bin/gap
Set the environment variable SAGE_LOCAL.
```
and one instead has to run:

```
$ /path/to/sagedir/sage --gap
```
or

```
$ SAGE_LOCAL='/path/to/sagedir' /path/to/sagedir/local/bin/gap
```
(where `/path/to/sagedir` should be replaced by the actual path to
the Sage installation directory).

This makes it hard to use
[Gap.app](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cocoagap), the macOS
interface to GAP by Russ Woodroofe, with the GAP shipped by Sage.

A few suggestions:

rename `SOURCED_SAGE_ENV_CONFIG` to `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` (we already have a `SAGE_ENV_SOURCED`) variable as well.

Make `sage-env-config` itself responsible for setting `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED`, rather than setting it in `sage-env`.

```
+# SAGE_ROOT is the location of the Sage source/build tree.
+export SAGE_ROOT="@abs_top_srcdir@"
```

Wouldn't this permanently encode the directory in which Sage happens to be built in any Sage installation, including for binary builds?  E.g. if Volker does a binary build and publishes it, then it will contain in `local/bin/sage-env-config` something like `SAGE_ROOT=/home/vbraun/src/sage/` and won't work when moved.  So I'm not sure this make sense to me...

How do distros currently handle `$SAGE_ROOT`, a path that doesn't have significant meaning in standard installs?  Perhaps what we need is to do away with any dependency on `$SAGE_ROOT` at runtime.

Yes, that's what it does. Sage installations (`SAGE_LOCAL`) and non-`distclean` source trees (`SAGE_ROOT`) are not relocatable with or without this ticket.

> including for binary builds? E.g. if Volker does a binary build and publishes it, then it will contain in `local/bin/sage-env-config` something like `SAGE_ROOT=/home/vbraun/src/sage/` and won't work when moved.  


The binary build uses `SAGE_ROOT` = a long pseudorandom path and then rewrites all paths, including this one, using https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/binary_pkg/templates/relocate-once.py the first time that `SAGE_ROOT/sage` is used.

> How do distros currently handle `$SAGE_ROOT`, a path that doesn't have significant meaning in standard installs?  


Distributions tend to replace all of `sage-env` by their own tooling anyway.

> Perhaps what we need is to do away with any dependency on `$SAGE_ROOT` at runtime.


Yes, in fact, there's very little left (see #25828/#28815). In any case, that's orthogonal to the present ticket.

Actually it is already documented that `sage-env` "uses bash features, so it cannot be used with other shells." It is sourced by other scripts, so it does not need a #! line.

I fixed all of the bashisms in #29345, but missed that comment. The sage build now fails again with any other `/bin/sh`:

```
cd '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf' && . '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin/sage-env' && . '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/bin/sage-build-env-config' && sage-logger -p '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf/spkg-install' '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/logs/pkgs/sage_conf-none.log'
/bin/sh: 123: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin/sage-env: Bad substitution
Error: SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR is set to a bad value:
SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf
You must correct it or erase it and rerun this script
make[3]: *** [Makefile:2022: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/lib/sage/installed/sage_conf-none] Error 1
```

Debian's dash shell is crippled, but would it be possible to symlink `/bin/sh` to dash on e.g. Arch linux, or maybe to ksh on some other distro that we have CI for? (To prevent regressions in the future?)
