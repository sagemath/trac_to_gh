Installing `scipy 0.19.1` (source release) with `python 3.7` generate multiple errors of this kind:

```
scipy/cluster/_vq.c: In function ‘__Pyx__ExceptionSave’:
    scipy/cluster/_vq.c:9728:19: error: ‘PyThreadState {aka struct _ts}’ has no member named ‘exc_type’
         *type = tstate->exc_type;
                       ^
    scipy/cluster/_vq.c:9729:20: error: ‘PyThreadState {aka struct _ts}’ has no member named ‘exc_value’
         *value = tstate->exc_value;
                        ^
    scipy/cluster/_vq.c:9730:17: error: ‘PyThreadState {aka struct _ts}’ has no member named ‘exc_traceback’
         *tb = tstate->exc_traceback;
```

This can be fixed by forcing `*.pyx` files to be recythonized.

Do you have to remove `cythonize.dat`? If so, document why.

If you really must remove `cythonize.dat`, I would do it with a `rm -f` instead of a patch. The problem with a patch is that it must be updated every time we upgrade scipy.
