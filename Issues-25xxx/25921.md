I'd love to read a good explanation. All over the web you'll find different partial explanations about the problem and what the environment variable does but never with a lot of technical detail.

For example, there is talk about "multi-threaded applications" but what **exactly** is a multi-threaded application?

I think the talk about "multi-threaded applications" is perhaps mostly a red-herring.

The issue is that Objective-C runtime functions are not allowed to be called between the `fork()` and `exec()` in a child process--if you do the runtime calls `abort()`.

If there's just a single process I think it doesn't matter.\n\nIt may not be entirely wrong:\n\n> A process shall be created with a single thread. If a multi-threaded process calls fork(), the new process shall contain a replica of the calling thread and its entire address space, possibly including the states of mutexes and other resources. Consequently, to avoid errors, the child process may only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called. [THR] [Option Start]  Fork handlers may be established by means of the pthread_atfork() function in order to maintain application invariants across fork() calls.\n\nIf the runtime itself can't guarantee that \"the child process [will] only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called\" then it's safer for it to blow up immediately than maybe work, or maybe result in even harder to debug errors.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't suck, but it seems to make some sense...",

That's basically my understanding, though upon rereading the linked article, it does pertain to multi-threaded applications insofar as this is *only* a problem when forking from a multi-threaded process.  If there's just a single process I think it doesn't matter.

It may not be entirely wrong:

> A process shall be created with a single thread. If a multi-threaded process calls fork(), the new process shall contain a replica of the calling thread and its entire address space, possibly including the states of mutexes and other resources. Consequently, to avoid errors, the child process may only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called. [THR] [Option Start]  Fork handlers may be established by means of the pthread_atfork() function in order to maintain application invariants across fork() calls.

If the runtime itself can't guarantee that "the child process [will] only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called" then it's safer for it to blow up immediately than maybe work, or maybe result in even harder to debug errors.

I'm not saying it doesn't suck, but it seems to make some sense...

If someone can figure out a way to fix what's wrong, that's great. On the other hand, I don't think they test anything particularly compelling, since the same commands work fine interactively. So if it turns out to be easy to fix, I am happy to fix it, but if it is complicated, perhaps we could spend our efforts fixing more important things. Or maybe I'm underestimating somehow the importance of these failures.

Put another way, how is changing the doctests different, qualitatively, from doing `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=yes` before running doctests? Both bypass the problem without solving it.

Okay, I can see that. Are there dangers to setting `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=yes` always? (It would be good for me to know, since I am currently setting this in my .bashrc file to avoid these doctest failures.)

"dangers" in which sense? It's removing a safety check, so it could be considered a bad idea. On the other hand, my impression is that this safety check is not very good so maybe it deserves to be disabled.

The way I understand things (I certainly may be wrong), that error message protects against a crash that may happen if one thread of an application is calling `fork()` while another thread is executing objective-C code. Those are very precise conditions which are highly unlikely to occur in Sage (and probably Python in general): multi-threading is used in Sage, but only in low-level C libraries which wouldn't run objective-C code.

But the error message triggers any time that objective-C code is called after `fork()`, regardless of whether threads are involved, let alone that those threads are executing objective-C code.

So it seems to me that disabling the error message is the right thing to do.

Maybe, but not in this ticket. What you propose should fit in a larger discussion about how to handle environment variables. It doesn't make sense to me to special-case this one environment variable `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY`.

This fixes the problem and I think it should be merged quickly; enhancements to `sage.env` should be on another ticket. Separate topics should be on separate tickets unless they are inextricably entwined, and I don't think that's the case for `sage.env`.
