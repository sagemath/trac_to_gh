Open to different ideas about this, but here's a proposal for better handling of tests that have the possibility of eating up all memory (such as the test toward the beginning of `matrix_mod2_dense.pyx`:

```
            sage: import resource
            sage: if resource.RLIMIT_AS == getattr(resource, 'RLIMIT_RSS', None):
            ....:     # Skip this test if RLIMIT_AS is not properly
            ....:     # supported like on OS X, see Trac #24190
            ....:     raise RuntimeError("matrix allocation failed")
            ....: else:  # Real test
            ....:     MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^30)(1)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: matrix allocation failed
```

This fixes #25884, and also maintains the fix for OSX, since now by default this test will not run on those platforms unless the user explicitly passes `--memlimit=0` for no memory limit on tests.

Actually, I find the name `high mem` a bit misleading: this is a test specifically designed to allocate a large amount of memory **and fail doing that**. So it has a very specific meaning and I'm not convinced that we need support in the doctest framework for that.

Why not just fix the doctest that is breaking?

Except I didn't notice any high memory usage in that module once I tested this.  Perhaps there was a memory leak that was fixed or something else.

"Just" fix the test is not that great either, because the "fix" is a convoluted workaround with the express purpose of effectively *skipping* that test, duplicating logic that is already needed in sage-runtests to check if it actually makes sense to set a memory limit on some platform or other.  This moves all the platform-specific stuff to one place, and sets a flag as to whether or not the test can be safely run.

So I do believe it's a useful addition.  I'm open to different nomenclature.

Isn't it just a matter of checking whether a memory limit was set? You could add a small helper function somewhere for that.

Adding new doctest infrastructure to fix a single broken doctest looks like way overkill to me.

Maybe my problem is that you should make it very clear what the semantics of `high mem` are (and change the name to something that more accurately reflects the semantics, like `# optional - memlimit`). You are giving too much the incorrect impression that `# high mem` is analogous to `# long time`, but for memory instead of running time.

When you write "tests that might run out of memory" in [comment:7], I have the impression that even you don't understand it (and I really don't mean to offend!). It's a test which is specifically written to allocate more memory than available.

Okay, that's a very different "problem" than "this adds 'infrastructure' just to fix one test".  

I do understand the test clearly, and problem is that on Cygwin it's simply not possible to set a virtual memory limit at all (at least not with `setrlimit`) and on OSX `RLIMIT_AS` is set equivalent to `RLIMIT_RSS`, so while the test may pass, it will gobble up physical memory needlessly :(  Therefore it's better that the test be skipped.

I'd be happy with `# optional - memlimit` though it's not clear to me how that's much different.  I get confused about what `# optional` is supposed to be used for, since it usually (but not always?) seems to pertain to optional packages...

Originally the way I was going to test this was not even going to be to test the rlimit itself, but just test the behavior with regard to skipping the tests are not, as well as what setting `--memlimit=0` does.

This could all be added as well of course.  If you're OK with making the test so platform-specific then I could add such tests as well.  I was just trying to avoid that, but it also seems impossible to avoid completely...
