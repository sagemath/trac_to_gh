Open to different ideas about this, but here's a proposal for better handling of tests that have the possibility of eating up all memory (such as the test toward the beginning of `matrix_mod2_dense.pyx`:

```
            sage: import resource
            sage: if resource.RLIMIT_AS == getattr(resource, 'RLIMIT_RSS', None):
            ....:     # Skip this test if RLIMIT_AS is not properly
            ....:     # supported like on OS X, see Trac #24190
            ....:     raise RuntimeError("matrix allocation failed")
            ....: else:  # Real test
            ....:     MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2^30)(1)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: matrix allocation failed
```

This fixes #25884, and also maintains the fix for OSX, since now by default this test will not run on those platforms unless the user explicitly passes `--memlimit=0` for no memory limit on tests.

Except I didn't notice any high memory usage in that module once I tested this.  Perhaps there was a memory leak that was fixed or something else.

"Just" fix the test is not that great either, because the "fix" is a convoluted workaround with the express purpose of effectively *skipping* that test, duplicating logic that is already needed in sage-runtests to check if it actually makes sense to set a memory limit on some platform or other.  This moves all the platform-specific stuff to one place, and sets a flag as to whether or not the test can be safely run.

So I do believe it's a useful addition.  I'm open to different nomenclature.

Isn't it just a matter of checking whether a memory limit was set? You could add a small helper function somewhere for that.

Adding new doctest infrastructure to fix a single broken doctest looks like way overkill to me.

Maybe my problem is that you should make it very clear what the semantics of `high mem` are (and change the name to something that more accurately reflects the semantics, like `# optional - memlimit`). You are giving too much the incorrect impression that `# high mem` is analogous to `# long time`, but for memory instead of running time.

When you write "tests that might run out of memory" in [comment:7], I have the impression that even you don't understand it (and I really don't mean to offend!). It's a test which is specifically written to allocate more memory than available.
