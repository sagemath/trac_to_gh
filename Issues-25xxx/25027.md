In the following plot

```
plot([(x+2)*e^(1/x), x+3], (x, -5, 15), ymax=10, detect_poles='show')
```
the x+3 line is interrupted. I think detect_poles causes this. My current work-around is to use plot_points=1000.

**Keywords:** plot line interrupted

Your issue, I think, is caused by plotting both functions together; apparently it's detecting the other one's pole, which is strange.

The underlying thing is weirder, actually; see [this example](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJxTLsjJL9GI1qjQNtTUSo3TMNTXqNA11NTUUajQNorVUdCo0FHQNdVRMDQFClXmJlbYGhroKKSklqQml8QX5OekFtuqF2fkl6tr8nKBjcJiEvFmaIONANqMXZMmACCHL5g=&lang=sage).

```
plot((x+1)*e^(1/(x-1)), (x, -5, 15), ymax=10, detect_poles=True)+plot(x+2, (x, -5, 15), ymax=10)
```
This allows one to see it slightly better, since it isn't on the y-axis.  Unless this is a separate issue.

This is weird, because I don't see an obvious place in the code where it should do this if the slopes aren't within epsilon of infinity, so to speak, and definitely not in these cases.  Sorry I can't help right away with an obvious fix, because the code was reasonable when put in and I don't recall this particular thing coming up.
