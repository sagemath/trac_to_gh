graphviz color format should be one of the following
- HSV triple such as `".08396, 0.4862,0.8549"`
- RGB triple such as `#DA70D6`
- a color name such as `orchid`
As a consequence the following is broken

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1)])
sage: G.set_latex_options(edge_colors={(0,1): (0.3, 0.9, 0.0)}, format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
```
To make it coherent with matplotlib option as in

```
sage: plot(x, color=(0.3, 0.9, 0))
```
we convert 3-tuples in RGB format using the `to_hex` function from matplotlib.

```

to gain some time at start up?
