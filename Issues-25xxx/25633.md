As briefly discussed on ask.sagemath.org (https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42492/huge-delay-in-sagecryptosboxsbox-method-nonlinearity-introduced-in-v82/?answer=42505#post-id-42505), the implementation for computing the linear approximation table can be speed up.
Similarly, the difference distribution matrix computation should be faster. Maybe the module should just be converted to cython.

Should I fix this within this ticket or create a new one?

<a id='comment:29'></a>Some comments:

- Instead of using `long` and `int`, you should use the more machine-independent `Py_ssize_t` (unless you have a specific reason to limit the size, such as you know these must be small values).

- Replace `[GF(2)(0)]` with `[GF(2).zero()]`.
- Why are you converting to `ZZ` here `X = ZZ([ZZ(i) for i in X], 2)` when `i` is already an `int`?

A list is lightweight compared to a vector and implemented directly into the Python interpreter/language, so it is much faster.

IDK as this is outside of my area of math. If it is the object you return and mathematically it should be in `GF(2)`, then you should keep the conversion. I was merely commenting on your question above returning a list versus a vector.

Micro-optimization:

```python
F = GF(2)
x = [F(i) for i in ZZ(x).digits(base=2, padto=n)]
```
so you do not (re)create `GF(2)` on every call.

<a id='comment:39'></a>No I have no other timing checks. And its also quite late here, so I wont have much time for some experiments in the next few hours..

From my intuition it might be worth to look for optimisations in the `__call__` method. I assume it is the most called method and the current input handling looks like it takes some time.. But I also do not know how to handle this more elegant.

It's basically only a array look up, but for sake of easier handling, we also want to support vector/list/tuple inputs (that encodes the array index as a binary string) or a finite field element (where the coefficient vector encodes the index as binary string, or, equivalent, the return value is the evaluation of the polynomial representation of the sbox).

Currently this is done with this try blocks, but I guess catching exceptions just to handle different input types might not be the fastest option.

In the end I was a bit confused and then forgot about this again. But I think you are right, it should be 1 + a.

When fixing this thou, other doctests that rely on the current behaviour fail:

<a id='comment:62'></a>Yes you are right.

I agree with your changes, that `interpolation_polynomial` should directly use `__call__`.
However, changing the endianness for the finite field input inside the call function breaks a lot of stuff at other places.

Thus, I'd propose to (instead of what suggested by Martin and mentioned by me above) keep the documented behaviour.
