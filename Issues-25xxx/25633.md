As briefly discussed on ask.sagemath.org (https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42492/huge-delay-in-sagecryptosboxsbox-method-nonlinearity-introduced-in-v82/?answer=42505#post-id-42505), the implementation for computing the linear approximation table can be speed up.
Similarly, the difference distribution matrix computation should be faster. Maybe the module should just be converted to cython.

Depends on #25516

In #25708 some SBox class methods were deprecated.
These now throw an error, when called:

```python
sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
sage: S = SBox(7,6,0,4,2,5,1,3)
sage: S.difference_distribution_matrix()
/home/asante/werkstatt/werkbank/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: difference_distribution_matrix is deprecated. Please use difference_distribution_table instead.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/25708 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23

    429
    430     def __get__(self, inst, cls=None):
TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 0 positional arguments (1 given)
```

Should I fix this within this ticket or create a new one?
And does anyone has an idea whats wrong with this deprecation?
The new methods work as expected.

We should fix this within this ticket by not making it an alias but manually issuing the deprecation warning and calling the corresponding function. So something like this:

```python
def difference_distribution_matrix(self):
    """
    Deprecated in :trac:`25708` for :meth:`difference_distribution_table`.
    """
    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
    deprecation(25708, "difference_distribution_matrix is deprecated. Please use difference_distribution_table instead.")
    return self.difference_distribution_table()
```
Since this is slated to be removed, it is not worth the time to add doctests.

Some comments:

- Instead of using `long` and `int`, you should use the more machine-independent `Py_ssize_t` (unless you have a specific reason to limit the size, such as you know these must be small values).

- In `_nterms`, it would be good to mark `total`, `divisor`, and `var_choices` as `Py_ssize_t`. Do you also want `var_choices/divisor` to be floor/integer division? If so, I think it is better to do `var_choices//divisor` to better emphasize this.

- It might be better to not declare `i` to be a `bint` in `from_bits` as you never use that fact (so it avoids extra checks in Cython). Also, why is there even a `swp` function? Would it be better to just do

  ```python
        if self._big_endian:
            x = list(reversed(x))
        return ZZ([i for i in self._rpad(swp(x), n)], 2)
  ```
- Replace `[GF(2)(0)]` with `[GF(2).zero()]`.
- Why are you converting to `ZZ` here `X = ZZ([ZZ(i) for i in X], 2)` when `i` is already an `int`? It might also be good to take care of this comment in `Integer`: `# should probably also have fast code for Python ints...` It actually seems like a good thing to factor the code to construct an integer from a bitstring out into a `cdef` helper function.
- It seems redundant to call `vector` here `return K(vector(GF(2), out))`. Shouldn't `K` be able to handle `out`?
- You could consider making `output_bits` into an array that you manually `alloc`/`free` so you will have better type control and can initialize without having to create a temp object to reverse it.
- You could use the `get_unsafe` operations for `lat` and `act` (once you explicitly cast it as a `Matrix` object).
- This is not correct: `cdef A = []`. I believe you want `cdef list A = []`.
- Add the `cdef list` declaration: `cdef list L = [self(i) for i in range(1 << m)]`.
- I would factor out the `substitute` into a `cdef` function and explicitly declare variable types.

regarding the `cdef Py_ssize_t`, should I also change parts like the following?

```python
cdef int i
x = [GF(2)(i) for i in ZZ(x).digits(base=2, padto=n)]
```


Another thing that comes to my mind, when I see this part: I'm not so sure how helpful it actually is, to convert the digits to GF(2) elements, as we are only returning a list and not a vector.

But I guess changing this could cause some other code to break, so it may not be good to do so?

I don't see the benefit of saying/converting `i` to an `int` because the `GF(2)` element constructor does not use that information. So it essentially adds another useless check. Thus, I would remove the `cdef int i` altogether.

A list is lightweight compared to a vector and implemented directly into the Python interpreter/language, so it is much faster.

IDK as this is outside of my area of math. If it is the object you return and mathematically it should be in `GF(2)`, then you should keep the conversion. I was merely commenting on your question above returning a list versus a vector.

Micro-optimization:

```python
F = GF(2)
x = [F(i) for i in ZZ(x).digits(base=2, padto=n)]
```
so you do not (re)create `GF(2)` on every call.

Yes, that is good (both for reviewing and history, makes it easier to find when bugs might have been introduced; I am not as good as I should be with granularity of my commits...).

Indirect doctests are good. Strictly speaking, I think our policy is `cdef` functions/methods do not need doctests, but it is better to have them when can be meaningful.

```
sage: L = list(map(GF(2), [1,0,1,0,1]))
sage: %timeit k(vector(L))
The slowest run took 896.22 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

No I have no other timing checks. And its also quite late here, so I wont have much time for some experiments in the next few hours..

From my intuition it might be worth to look for optimisations in the `__call__` method. I assume it is the most called method and the current input handling looks like it takes some time.. But I also do not know how to handle this more elegant.

It's basically only a array look up, but for sake of easier handling, we also want to support vector/list/tuple inputs (that encodes the array index as a binary string) or a finite field element (where the coefficient vector encodes the index as binary string, or, equivalent, the return value is the evaluation of the polynomial representation of the sbox).

Currently this is done with this try blocks, but I guess catching exceptions just to handle different input types might not be the fastest option.

Thanks for checking this. I stumbled across this during changing to cython.
In the end I was a bit confused and then forgot about this again. But I think you are right, it should be 1 + a.

When fixing this thou, other doctests that rely on the current behaviour fail:

With my latest changes, I am getting a speedup from your last comment of `72ms` and `36ms` to `60ms` and `<22ms` respectively.

Some other timings of current:
without my last commit:

```
sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox

sage: k.<a> = GF(2^3)

sage: %timeit S(5)

```
vs your branch:

```

Yes you are right.

I agree with your changes, that `interpolation_polynomial` should directly use `__call__`.
However, changing the endianness for the finite field input inside the call function breaks a lot of stuff at other places.

Thus, I'd propose to (instead of what suggested by Martin and mentioned by me above) keep the documented behaviour.
