I've got the suspicion that this is a NTL context mismatch. The danger is that a !Python/Cython destructor is being called at inopportune times and changes the (global) NTL context. This can happen whenever Python objects are being allocated. Its more likely if there is memory pressure, which would explain why I'm seeing this on the buildbot but it disappers when tested in isolation.

In the attached branch I'm introducing `_assert_is_current_modulus()` methods to debug this better. 

In particular, the constructors for the ntl wrappers like `ntl_ZZ_pE` are not entirely safe in that they occasionally change the context away from the context of the NTL object that is being wrapped. Since they are Python objects there is an unavoidable allocation, though they then restore the context in `__cinit__`. But then `__init__` tends to create auxiliary Python objects which can change the context again. There are two possible contracts here

1. Instantiating NTL wrappers can change the context, and the user must restore the context before any further NTL calls that require a context

2. Instantiating NTL wrappers shall not change the context, and any branch in the constructor that potentially causes a gc must be followed up with a context restore.

Setting the NTL context should be quite cheap, so I'm in favor of the the safer option 2. Even though it might cause unneeded NTL context restores.

Actually, this is the only possibility. When `__init__` ends some temporary objects go out of scope and this can trigger a gc, changing the NTL context. So even if you had the correct NTL context at the last line of `__init__`, it can be different once you return to the calling site.
