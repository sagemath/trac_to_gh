```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: is_square((cos(x) + 1)^2)
True
sage: is_square((cos(x) + 1)^2, True)   # WTF?
Traceback (most recetn call last):

TypeError: unable to convert 2 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/24*x^4 - 1/720*x^6 + 1/40320*x^8 - 1/3628800*x^10 + 1/479001600*x^12 - 1/87178291200*x^14 + 1/20922789888000*x^16 + O(x^18) to a symbolic expression
```
And for example, the following should be `False`

```
sage: is_square(cos(x) - cos(x).taylor(x, 0, 20))
True
```

I would suggest to let this method raise `NotImplementedError` whenever it is not possible to call `is_square` on the underlying pyobject.
