For some reason nix's version of python reports

```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("invalid print statement")?
```

while sage expects the message without the suggestion:


```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
```

This patch makes sages doctests accept both versions.
