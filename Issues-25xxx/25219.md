Power series have a `reverse()` method for series of valuation 1.

This enhancement wraps the power series method and makes it available for LaurentSeries of valuation 1.

```
sage: R.<x> = Frac(QQ[['x']])
sage: f = 2*x + 3*x^2 - x^4 + O(x^5)
sage: g = f.reverse()
sage: g
1/2*x - 3/8*x^2 + 9/16*x^3 - 131/128*x^4 + O(x^5)
sage: f(g)
x + O(x^5)
sage: g(f)
x + O(x^5)
```

It is very counterintuitive to have methods whose output type depends on the nature of the answer. If you do `4/2` in Sage you do not obtain an integer but a rational number. I don't understand why `.reverse()` should be any different.

I would suggest to have `reverse` and `reverse_unit`.

I am just asking for your opinion as this is beyond the scope of the ticket.

I chose to mimic the behavior of the existing `reverse` method in `PowerSeries_poly`.  Its docstring states:

    If the leading coefficient is not a unit, we pass to its fraction field if possible

The Laurent series code calls the power series code, and follows its lead.  So the answer to your question is yes, power series really do behave this way:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[[]]
sage: (2*x+x^2).parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: (2*x+x^2).reverse()
1/2*x - 1/8*x^2 + 1/16*x^3 - 5/128*x^4 + 7/256*x^5 - 21/1024*x^6 + 33/2048*x^7 - 429/32768*x^8 + 715/65536*x^9 - 2431/262144*x^10 + 4199/524288*x^11 - 29393/4194304*x^12 + 52003/8388608*x^13 - 185725/33554432*x^14 + 334305/67108864*x^15 - 9694845/2147483648*x^16 + 17678835/4294967296*x^17 - 64822395/17179869184*x^18 + 119409675/34359738368*x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: (2*x+x^2).reverse().parent()
Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field
```

I would tend to think that it should work this way, that `4/2` should return an integer and only `3/2` should return a rational, but I haven't thought about it enough to have a really informed opinion.

It used to fail.  I don't know what changed to fix it, but it was somewhere else in Sage.  I'll bisect the code if you really want to track it down.

Once it was working, I added it as a test case, but forgot that it was already there as a "known bug" example.  Fixed.
