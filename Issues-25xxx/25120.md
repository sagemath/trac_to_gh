AssertionError: r is not a valid format for edge
```

The confusion comes from the fact that the convention for `edge_colors` with `.plot()` is the reverse

```
sage: G.plot?
...
   * "edge_colors" - a dictionary specifying edge colors: each key
     is a color recognized by matplotlib, and each entry is a list of
     edges.
...
```
So is the case for `graphviz_string`

```
sage: G.graphviz_string?
...
   * "edge_colors" -- (default: None) a dictionary whose keys are
     colors and values are list of edges. }
...
```

Hi Vincent,

Ouch, this clash of option format is annoying indeed. I went through the code and patch, and not sure what's the best way out. Especially since I am pretty sure there is code around using `set_latex_options` with `edge_options` already in the graphviz_string format.

I am available for a phone brainstorm this morning if you are available.

What if we rather change the documentation of `sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex.set_option` so that it takes a dict `colors -> list of edges` like the others. Then, this ticket would do some modification of the `tkz_picture` code to revert the dict the other way around?

This way, the dict `edge_colors` would always have the same form as input.

This clash of option was there and will remain after the ticket. I will not try to fix it. Would it be possible to review this ticket (which does fix an issue) without discussing the option clash?

Indeed, I realised soon after that my suggestion would have been backward incompatible.

Once stuff are in Sage we can not change their interface anymore. This is why I am keeping my `TikzPicture` in my personnal package for now, because I am still sometimes changing its interface.

To make sure all the test are tested in the file, I did:

```
sage -t --show-skipped --optional=dot2tex,sage,graphviz src/sage/graphs/graph_latex.py
```

Thanks for digging this problem and fixing this issue. I may have stumble over this many years ago. But, once I realized that `color_by_labels=True` was working and I have always been using this way and forgot about the problem you are fixing.
