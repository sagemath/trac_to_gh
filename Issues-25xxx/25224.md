Keywords: FriCAS

The function `dilog` in the output of an integration using `algorithm='fricas'` has a different meaning than `dilog` when integrating using other algorithms.

These different definitions of dilog can be observed as follows:

```
sage: integrate(log(x)/(1-x),x,algorithm='fricas')
sage: integrate(log(x)/(1-x),x,algorithm='sympy')
dilog(x)
dilog(-x+1)
```

That is, sagemath considers `Li_2(x)=dilog(x)` but fricas uses
`Li_2(x)=dilog(1-x)`. The wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spence%27s_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spence%27s_function) mentions these two alternative definitions.

To exemplify:

```
sage: fricas("dilog(1)")
0
sage: dilog(0)
0
```

I am not sure but it seems like the s=2 polylog is the only mismatch. In the fricas source
code (btw there is a new version 1.3.3 around) I found this in the file combfunc.spad:

```
 if F has ElementaryFunctionCategory then
        if F has LiouvillianFunctionCategory then
            iiPolylog(s, x) ==
                s = 1 => -log(1 - x)
                s = 2::F => dilog(1 - x)
                kernel(opPolylog, [s, x])
        else
            iiPolylog(s, x) ==
                s = 1 => -log(1 - x)
                kernel(opPolylog, [s, x])
    else
        iiPolylog(s, x) == kernel(opPolylog, [s, x])
```
which seems to be the source for the mismatch in the polylog(s,x) definition at s=2 for the name `dilog`. But apparently no other cases like that are present.

And thank you for your work!

Done now. I was actually aware of your fix there because that bug had hit me last week.
