As discussed in #25837, we should add a deprecation notice to sagenb. It has been de-facto replaced (at least the notebook itself, not all of its features) a while ago. However we never really communicated that to the user.

Before we move forward with deprecating the notebook, we should inform the active users of sagenb.

Yeah I think being a bit nagging and not that easily dismissable and forgotten might be considered a feature here.

I would personally prefer a shorter period of one or two releases before the notebook is made optional (assuming the necessary changes can be made in that time). We could then still give that optional package live support for half a year or a year.

I deliberately kept the original proposal short. I am happy with your version. If you think its not too long, we can proceed.

Also is the login screen shown often enough for this to be effective? As I've said I have only ever used the sagenb once, and while testing this I had to actively log out to see this.

+1 for two reasons:

- Some institutional installs of sagenb my bypass the login page to use LDAP authentication or something else.

The German version is a more or less direct translation of my initial proposal. I prefer that one too, but compromised to Erik's version. I forgot to update the German translation.

`@`Erik what do you think?

For the non-german speakers: "Warning: The sage notebook is in the process of being deprecated. Click here to learn more."

Alternatively even shorter (but some people might not like the "soon"): "Warning: The sage notebook will be deprecated soon. Click here to learn more."
