As discussed in #25837, we should add a deprecation notice to sagenb. It has been de-facto replaced (at least the notebook itself, not all of its features) a while ago. However we never really communicated that to the user.

Before we move forward with deprecating the notebook, we should inform the active users of sagenb.

Yes, and I believe at least 1/2 year is standard policy, though a year is probably better here.  Luckily through a sort of process of osmosis this has slowly been communicated for a while.

This would almost certainly need at least some minor changes to sagenb.  One could be fancy and have some javascript with a banner message that disappears and you can ask "don't show this again" but perhaps something more basic just hard-coded in to the main login and list of worksheets page would be easier and more obvious.

+1 for two reasons:

- Some institutional installs of sagenb my bypass the login page to use LDAP authentication or something else.

The German version is a more or less direct translation of my initial proposal. I prefer that one too, but compromised to Erik's version. I forgot to update the German translation.

`@`Erik what do you think?

For the non-german speakers: "Warning: The sage notebook is in the process of being deprecated. Click here to learn more."

Alternatively even shorter (but some people might not like the "soon"): "Warning: The sage notebook will be deprecated soon. Click here to learn more."
