While using the Boost interface to compute the blocks and cut vertices, the output is wrong if the input is a directed graph.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import blocks_and_cut_vertices
sage: rings = graphs.CycleGraph(10)
sage: rings.merge_vertices([0, 5])
sage: blocks_and_cut_vertices(rings, algorithm="Tarjan_Boost")
([[0, 1, 4, 2, 3], [0, 6, 9, 7, 8]], [0])
```

```
sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import blocks_and_cut_vertices
sage: rings = graphs.CycleGraph(10)
sage: rings.merge_vertices([0, 5])
sage: rings = rings.to_directed()
sage: blocks_and_cut_vertices(rings, algorithm="Tarjan_Boost")
([[0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0, 6, 9, 7, 8]], [0, 9, 8, 6, 7])
```

If the input graph is a directed graph, the blocks and cut vertices are computed on the underlying simple graph.
