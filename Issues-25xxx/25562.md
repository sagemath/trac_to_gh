Done now:

- For dimension 1 check if the poset is chain; for dimension 2 check if the incomparability graph is a comparability graph for some other poset. Only then proceed to use MILP and hypergraphs.

- Remove internal check from the function.

Done earlier:

- To doc add a mention about this being NP-complete.

- Add a randomized check to `tests/*`.

To be done later:

- Do at least series-parallel decomposition first, compute by parts.

- For lattices run `irreducibles_poset()` first.

Good points. I used all of them, except one that is quite slow. Btw, there is ready-made posets.StandardExample available.
