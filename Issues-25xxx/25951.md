Put in maps from an order ideal / order filter to the corresponding maximal / minimal antichain. Also, use the antichain iterator to make an order ideal iterator or a function order_ideals which outputs the set of order ideals. (All that exists right now is the command order_ideals_lattice which outputs the set of order ideals and all the lattice relations.)

Is this just going to be minor modification to existing framework, or is this going to be the bigger task of turning antichains and order ideals into their own class?
