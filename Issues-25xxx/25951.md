Put in maps from an order ideal / order filter to the corresponding maximal / minimal antichain. Also, use the antichain iterator to make an order ideal iterator or a function order_ideals which outputs the set of order ideals. (All that exists right now is the command order_ideals_lattice which outputs the set of order ideals and all the lattice relations.)

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Is this just going to be minor modification to existing framework, or is this going to be the bigger task of turning antichains and order ideals into their own class?
