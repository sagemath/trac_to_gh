One of the tests in `src/sage/categories/principal_ideal_domains.py` (lines 80-83) is testing that the following ring is not a UFD

```python
sage: K = QuadraticField(5)
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: O in UniqueFactorizationDomains()
False
```


However, trying rings of integers of number fields, which are UFDs or PIDs still gives false as an answer.

```python
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: O = K.maximal_order()
sage: O in UniqueFactorizationDomains()
False
sage: O in PrincipalIdealDomains()
False
```

That's an interesting example, since the integer ring of `Q(\sqrt(5))` is actually a UFD and a PID.

Looking at the code of `UniqueFactorizationDomains().__contains__` one can see that any non-trivial functionality should go into O.is_unique_factorization_domain(). In this case the implementation could be `return self.class_number() == 1`. However, such a method isn't there, so you're seeing a true/false based on the stored categorical info, and integer rings are not categorically UFDs.

There may be bad ramifications from answering `UniqueFactorizationDomains().__contains__` via a probably very expensive class group computation, so there might be good practical reasons why a more functional `is_unique_factorization_domain` method isn't provided.

In any case, it may be worth changing the example to `K=QuadraticField(-5)` or so. It looks a bit silly to use a mathematically UFD in a setting to illustrate non-UFD behaviour.

I also don't see how `PolynomialRing(O,'x')` can be a PID: the ideal `(7,x)` is really not principal. Were these doctests written by a non-mathematician?
