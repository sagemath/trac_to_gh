is_postcritically_finite returns false for certain PCF functions. 

Below is an example of the code in which PCF fails. I first applied is_postcritically_finite to the function, which output False and then found the finite critical orbits. 

```
sage: P1.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1);
sage: H = P1.Hom(P1);
sage: a = .5; c = 1.5;
sage: f = H([-2*a*x^3+3*a*x^2*y+c*y^3,y^3]);
sage: f.is_postcritically_finite()
False 

sage: f.critical_points()
[(0 : 1), (1 : 0), (1 : 1)]

sage: P = P1(0,1)
sage: f(P)
(3/2 : 1)
sage: f(f(P))
(3/2 : 1)

sage: Q = P1(1,1)
sage: f(Q)
(2 : 1)
sage: f(f(f(Q)))
(2 : 1)


```

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
oops. I missed the fact this was already opened as a ticket. I pushed the fix to #25939. The issue is in canonical height, not in is_postcritically_finite.

If you agree that 25939, fixes the issue in is_postcritically_finite, then mark this as positive-review so that it gets closed as 'duplicate'. If there are still further issues with is_pcf, then we can revisit this ticket for those fixes.
