This object

```
sage: PariGroup(pari([6,-1,"S3"]), 3)
PARI group [6, -1, S3] of degree 3
```
is a `Group` but it doesn't really behave like a group at all. It really doesn't do anything more than just wrapping the PARI object `[6,-1,"S3"]` and adding a few trivial methods.

I added a `cardinality` to `PariGroup` in case someone was using that behavior, and I updated the doctest in `FiniteGroups`.
