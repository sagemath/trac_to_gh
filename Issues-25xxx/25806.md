Conda and Gentoo (and apparently also ArchLinux and Debian) suffer from hangs when talking to R through the pexpect interface on the first invocation in a Sage session. It is unclear what is the underlying issue. Shortening Sage's R prompt seems to fix the issue as does passing `--no-readline` to R.

Is there any reason why we should keep readline support when talking to R with the pexpect interface? Otherwise, we should just pass on that flag even though we do not fully understand why it fixes that particular issue.

See https://github.com/conda-forge/sagelib-feedstock/issues/19#issuecomment-402557595, and https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/dt-r-no-readline.patch.

This makes sense to me.  There is a similar issue #25363 where it was needed to disable prompt_toolkit for Cantor's pexect interface to Sage to work (I believe Cantor is wrong to use pexpect to wrap Sage in the first place, but that's a different story).

I don't know why this would be a problem on some platforms but not others.

#25503 does this already, and should ease downstream packaging (still needs review).

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A5):

> I don't know why this would be a problem on some platforms but not others.

To what i understand, this is not a platform issue, but a version issue: our interface does not work with readline 7.
