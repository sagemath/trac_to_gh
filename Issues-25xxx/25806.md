Conda and Gentoo (and apparently also ArchLinux and Debian) suffer from hangs when talking to R through the pexpect interface on the first invocation in a Sage session. It is unclear what is the underlying issue. Shortening Sage's R prompt seems to fix the issue as does passing `--no-readline` to R.

Is there any reason why we should keep readline support when talking to R with the pexpect interface? Otherwise, we should just pass on that flag even though we do not fully understand why it fixes that particular issue.

This makes sense to me.  There is a similar issue #25363 where it was needed to disable prompt_toolkit for Cantor's pexect interface to Sage to work (I believe Cantor is wrong to use pexpect to wrap Sage in the first place, but that's a different story).

I don't know why this would be a problem on some platforms but not others.

#25503 does this already, and should ease downstream packaging (still needs review).

To what i understand, this is not a platform issue, but a version issue: our interface does not work with readline 7.
