> Thats not a supported platform


What's your definition of "supported platform" and why does this system not satisfy?

Previous versions of Sage worked perfectly with 100% doctests passing and I actually use this machine for serious stuff (i.e. it's not a museum machine that I only use to annoy release managers with bug reports).

PS: I know that I've been messing up with cysignals breakage in this release cycle, but there is always some strange OS quirk that comes up.

Imho supported platform requires having a buildbot

The 2 users of Sage on that arch can just follow the develop branch.

We've seen how easy it is to break something by mucking with signal handlers in this release cycle, so I'm against last minute changes if they can be avoided

Can't argue with that I guess.

If it helps, there are no actual changes to signal handling, only to threading :-)
