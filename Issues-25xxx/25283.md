CC:  sage-combinat @AndrewAtLarge stumpc5 @fchapoton

Keywords: colored permutations, complex reflection groups

Because they are nice enough groups, we can define an algorithm using left descents (in a certain sense) to compute a reduced word for a colored permutation using the standard generating set.
