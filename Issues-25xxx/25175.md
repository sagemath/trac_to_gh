The Ackermann function is important to theoretical CS folks and is a very classic function. 

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function)

Sage can have this function defined.
Possible suggestions/features could look like:

1. There are many variants of the function but it seems pretty natural to include the two-argument Ackermann–Péter variant (this is also detailed in the wikipedia link).

2. Sage can include known values of the Ackermann function for (m,n) pairs eg: $Ackermann(4,2) = 2<sup>265536</sup> − 3$ etc.

3. Its Taylor series expansion is also known. (I don't have a link for this. But I believe Wolfram Alpha displays it.)

Here is another link to some Ackermann function values:

> 2. Sage can include known values of the Ackermann function for (m,n) pairs eg: $Ackermann(4,2) = 2<sup>265536</sup> − 3$ etc.

More generally, since integers in Sage are limited by `2<sup>(2</sup>67)`, we could implement this by a simple lookup:

1. A(0,n) = n + 1

2. A(1,n) = n + 2

3. A(2,n) = 2n + 3

4. A(3,n) = 2<sup>n+3</sup> - 3

5. A(4,0) = 13

5. A(4,1) = 65533

6. A(4,2) = 2<sup>65536</sup> − 3

7. A(5,0) = 65533

8. `raise OverflowError` in all other cases.
