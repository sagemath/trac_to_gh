There is a regression in the computation of the nonlinearity of an SBox introduced from 8.1 to 8.2+

Quoted from https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42492/huge-delay-in-sagecryptosboxsbox-method-nonlinearity-introduced-in-v82/

```sage
sage: for j in range(10):
....:     S = [x for x in range(256)];shuffle(S)
....:     S = sage.crypto.sbox.SBox(S)
....:     %time S.nonlinearity()
```

I expect the cause being the modification of the `linear_approximation_matrix` Method, i.e. the following diff

```diff
-        B = BooleanFunction(self.m)
-        L = []
-        for j in range(ncols):
-            for i in range(nrows):
-                B[i] = ZZ(self(i)&j).popcount()
-            L.append(B.walsh_hadamard_transform())
+        L = [self.component_function(i).walsh_hadamard_transform() for i in range(ncols)]
```

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hi Friedrich,

I have tested the patch and it fixes the problem and pass the doctests. However, I suggest the fix for this ticket should actually be done on the `component_function`. The value `b` in the `component_function` is kept as an integer. The Boolean function for the component function can be computed as

`ret[x] = ZZ(b & self(x)).popcount() & 1`
