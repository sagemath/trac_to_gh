Consider this example

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: print sorted(list(P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=3)))
[(-2 : 1), (-1 : 1), (-1/2 : 1), (0 : 1), (1/2 : 1), (1 : 0), (1 : 1), (2 : 1)]
```
Points of height 3 are not present.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2,QQ)
sage: list(P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=5))
```
here we have some points like `(2 : -4/3 : 1)` which have height=6, if we use enum_projective_rational_field function results are as we would expect. So the underlying definition for height of rational points need to be uniform in all these functions.

Just one comment here. What do you think about using?

```
self.point(c, check=False)
```

It is about twice as fast and since the function is for projective space (not a subscheme) it's not like we need to check that the point is well-defined. It will cause them not to be normalized to the last coordinate to 1 though.

I have the doctests running now, but I don't really expect a failure.
