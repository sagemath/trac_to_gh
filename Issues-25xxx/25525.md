We improve the algorithm computing the critical exponent for words.

For instance, consider the critical exponent of the length-1000 prefix of the Fibonacci word,

```div style="font-size: 80%"
  {{{#!python
  fibo = words.FibonacciWord()[:1000]
  % time fibo.critical_exponent()
  }}}
```

Before it took:

  CPU times: user 1min 19s, sys: 398 ms, total: 1min 19s\\
  Wall time: 1min 20s\\
  173/48

Now, it takes:

  CPU times: user 1.3 s, sys: 64.1 ms, total: 1.36 s\\
  Wall time: 1.34 s.\\
  173/48

This following line can be removed

```
        m = 0
```
(since `m` is later initialized with `m = pft[l-j+k-2]` before it is used)

It would be nice to add a little bit of comment in the code

```python
pft = [0] * wlen         # the prefix function table
queue = [(0, 0, -1, 0)]  # suffix tree vertices to visit for DFS
best_exp = 1             # best exponent so far
```

You can replace `w` with `self` instead of having two variables pointing to the same object.

What should be the critical exponent of the empty word? (I guess the function currently returns `1` but should rather raise an error). There should be a doctest for this.

Is it possible to add a reference in the documentation of the method to the article where this algorithm is defined?

I have time this morning to review the code. Otherwise, I will review it next Thursday.

The algorithm is the **same** as before. It is just more efficiently done. You just go through all factors of the word and compute the exponent. The version in this branch is better because
- instead of running through the factors it performs a depth first search in the suffix tree
- it does not build the factors, it simply updates the prefix function table

> I have time this morning to review the code. Otherwise, I will review it next Thursday.


[comment:8 comment:8] should be addressed before review (status is needs_work).
