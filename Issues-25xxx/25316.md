Python bug https://bugs.python.org/issue5755 won't be fixed in 2.7. it seems: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/7476

Because of that, Sage patches Python.

I don't know what the policy for that is, but at least in my opinion hard patches of dependencies (especially big ones such as Python) should be avoided if possible.

In this case it is possible: We can instead monkey-patch `build_extensions` to always remove the `-Wstrict-prototypes` argument. That's a bit of a hack of course. But it doesn't have any practical disadvantages to the Python patch and removes one patch from Python.

Two general comments:

1. This patch fixes a *warning*, it should not affect functionality. Are there any problems building Sage without this patch?

2. There are plenty of patches to Python in Sage. I don't think that all of them can be replaced by a monkey-patch, so how does it help if this one patch is removed?

Not building, but it causes the doctests to fail.

> 2. There are plenty of patches to Python in Sage. I don't think that all of them can be replaced by a monkey-patch, so how does it help if this one patch is removed?

Its not *that* much. I only had to adopt two: `re_match_index-issue_27177.patch` (apparently `re` is impossible to monkey-patch) and `descr_ref-issue_25750.patch`.

The re patch was accepted upstream but unfortuantely not backported to 2.7.

The other one is currently in an upstream PR and seems likely to be accepted.

So after that one is accepted, only one patch is needed. I think just because 0 patches can't be archived doesn't mean the amount shouldn't be minimized.

Its a matter of priorities: every patch to sages dependencies makes packaging sage a bit more painful. In my mind reducing that hurdle is more valuable than the \"purity\" gained by patching python instead. If upstream doesn't recognize the bug, I think its best to work around it if possible.\n\nIts not *that* important to me anymore: I already have a working patch for sage that probably won't be too hard to maintain.

I get where you're coming from. Its a matter of priorities: every patch to sages dependencies makes packaging sage a bit more painful. In my mind reducing that hurdle is more valuable than the "purity" gained by patching python instead. If upstream doesn't recognize the bug, I think its best to work around it if possible.

Its not *that* important to me anymore: I already have a working patch for sage that probably won't be too hard to maintain. But it is one more annoyance if somebody wants to create a sage package for another distro.

This is the part that I disagree most with. In my view, it's Python who is at fault here, not Sage.

Maybe I should just open a real pull request for the upstream Python issue?

Does that make any practical difference? Distutils will always be there anyways and while I haven't run any benchmarks, I can't imagine that it significantly impacts sages startup time.

Well its just a warning after all, so practically it mostly matters to fix the doctests.

That honestly exceeds my pthon knowledge.

Exactly my point.

We could instead just drop the patch entirely and fix the few failing doctests.

I think its very valuable to have the doctests pass. Sages doctests may be a bit brittle, but very valuable
nonetheless.
