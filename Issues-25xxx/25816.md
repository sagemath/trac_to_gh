This is a problem that has been plaguing me for a few months but I haven't taken much time to work out the source of the problem yet.

It might also be dependent on the package version of Cygwin's git pacakge, but when using the system git from Cygwin in a `./sage -sh` shell, it's broken.  A workaround is to put `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH` in front.  So it seems maybe some library installed as part of Sage is incompatible with the system git.

This is a problem, in particular, for `pip install`ing packages from a git repo, for example.

I'm not sure much can be done about this from the Sage end of things.  Perhaps for the Sage-for-Windows build I can ensure that some DLLs are copied into `/usr/libexec/git-core/` in order for git to function properly.

This works as a general solution.  I'll add it to the [Cygwin64Port](../wiki/Cygwin64Port) wiki page:

```
for dllname in $(cygcheck.exe /usr/libexec/git-core/*.exe | grep 'sage\\local' | sed 's|.*\\\(.\+\.dll\)|\1|' | sort | uniq); do
    cp /usr/bin/$dllname /usr/libexec/git-core/
done
```

This might also be worth mentioning upstream in the Cygwin git package, since this is a bit fragile.

Well, one thing we could do is prefer not to build those libraries in the first place.  That, of course, is being worked on...
