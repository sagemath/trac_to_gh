This is a problem that has been plaguing me for a few months but I haven't taken much time to work out the source of the problem yet.

It might also be dependent on the package version of Cygwin's git pacakge, but when using the system git from Cygwin in a `./sage -sh` shell, it's broken.  A workaround is to put `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH` in front.  So it seems maybe some library installed as part of Sage is incompatible with the system git.

This is a problem, in particular, for `pip install`ing packages from a git repo, for example.

**Status:** new

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25816

It could be some subtlety about the DLL order?  That remains unclear at the moment.  I need to take a closer look at the DLL dependency trees.

This works as a general solution.  I'll add it to the [Cygwin64Port](Cygwin64Port) wiki page:

```
for dllname in $(cygcheck.exe /usr/libexec/git-core/*.exe | grep 'sage\\local' | sed 's|.*\\\(.\+\.dll\)|\1|' | sort | uniq); do

```

This might also be worth mentioning upstream in the Cygwin git package, since this is a bit fragile.
