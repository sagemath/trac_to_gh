matrix/matrix_space.py (and maybe other modules) use a very inefficient way to check for the presence of object attributes, using try/except. For example, in change_ring you will find:

```
try:
    return self.__change_ring[R]
except AttributeError:
    self.__change_ring = {}
except KeyError:
    pass
```
Checking for presence via hasattr() is about 3 times faster, and more idiomatic:

```
if hasattr(self, '__change_ring'):
    if R in self.__change_ring:
        return self.__change_ring[R]
    else:
        self.__change_ring = {}
```

**Keywords:** matrix

The author should probably back this up with an explicit report on how these results were obtained.
For

```
class T(object):
    def __init__(self,a=None,b=None):
        if not(a is None):
            self.a=a
        if not(b is None):
            self.b=b
    def lookup1(self):
        try:
            return self.a
        except AttributeError:
            return self.b
    def lookup2(self):
        if hasattr(self,'a'):
            return self.a
        else:
            return self.b
A=T(a=1)
B=T(b=1)
```
I'm finding:

```
%timeit A.lookup1()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop
%timeit A.lookup2()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 221 ns per loop
%timeit B.lookup1()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.27 Âµs per loop
%timeit B.lookup2()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 550 ns per loop
```
So while the `hasattr` approach is faster than the `try/except` approach for a "miss", the "try/except" wins quite significantly for the "hit". I'm pretty sure the code in question purposefully tries to optimize that scenario.

I agree. The code in `matrix_space.py` is really doing some kind of caching, where you want to optimize for the case that the object is in the cache.

Concerning the ticket, I don't understand why `__change_ring` is not created in the constructor of matrix spaces!

As for your comment, using `try/except` is much faster in case of success than a double lookup with `hasattr`.

I don't know if it's justified as an optimization, but not allocating and initializing the `__change_ring` attribute [which would probably be a dictionary access, but it could be a slot] saves time when creating matrix spaces. Many matrix spaces never undergo changering operations, so it may well make sense to avoid the initialization overhead in general, at the expense of the special case. Matrices get used A LOT and need to be fast. They also get created of all kinds of different sizes, so creating the parents might happen more than is typical for parents in general.

So: if you want to investigate if it's worth changing this, go ahead, but I'd be very cautious in changing it.
