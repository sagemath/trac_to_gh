A while-we-are-at-it: can you change the header to use the standard copyright?

Bikeshedding: I find it better to break the 80 char/line guideline for code to avoid small breaks like this:

```diff
-        return super(FreeZinbielAlgebra, cls).__classcall__(cls, R, n, tuple(names))
+        return super(FreeZinbielAlgebra, cls).__classcall__(cls, R, n,
+                                                            tuple(names))
```

Bikeshedding nitpick:

```diff
-        - ``x`` and ``y`` -- two words
+        - ``x``, ``y`` -- two words
```

If you disagree with my comments, then I will be happy to set this to a positive review.
