Currently, the following fails in https://github.com/MCLF/henselization

```
sage: from henselization import *
sage: K = QQ.henselization(5)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: F = (x^2 + 1).factor()
```

The problem is an obvious `sort=False` that is missing in the valuation framework, i.e., factorizations get sorted (for no good reason) but some of the element in the henselization namespace do not support sorting.

I can't really write a doctest for this. There are no rings that support the valuation framework but can not decide equality (say lazy p-adics) in Sage yet. It's kind of obvious that `sort=False` should be there just like everywhere else in that file.
