The `prime_pi` function is currently a symbolic function that can hold its argument as in

```
sage: n = SR.var('n')
sage: prime_pi(n)
prime_pi(n)
```
that also contains the Cython code for evaluating it

```
sage: prime_pi(13543)
1603
```
Unfortunately, it is buggy, see #24960 (fixed in #32894, using this ticket). We will promote the spkg `primecount` to standard and use it instead. This ticket does this part, and reverts deprecations from #32412. It also removes obsolete deprecation warning, and the corresponding no longer available parameter.


Upstream patch: https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/pull/107 (rejected)

---
Below is the original part, no longer too relevant.

---
We move the evaluation part as a standalone function in `arith/` and provide alternative implementations
- using `PARI/GP` (only efficient in the range of tabulated primes)
- using the different algorithms in the library primecount that is packaged in #24966

<a id='comment:4'></a>The package `primecount` has been provided with Sage since version 8.3, has been updated several times and is already outdated https://repology.org/project/primecount/versions

Is it time to start using it?

Because `sage.libs.primecount` uses an optional library, in the modularization of sagelib it would have to be split out to a separate package. But since `src/sage/libs/primecount.pxd` and `src/sage/interfaces/primecount.pyx` do not depend on Sage at all (except for a use of `sage.misc.superseded`), it would be best to make it a standalone Python library, like you did with `pplpy`.

reading https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/-/blob/master/setup.py does not make me wiser, and anyway it's not a good example, as we're building it as a part of sagelib, anyway.

As primecount isn't always available as a system library, there should be some need for configuring paths, etc. 

That all that can be done in 10 minutes is, hmm, a joke.

As this ticket is making `primecount` a standard package, removing the `sage_setup: distribution` annotation is OK.

OK, here I need a shell programming advice. The problem I don't know how to solve is that cmake triggers an exit if it fails, so it teminates spkg-install script in case of failure. But I just want to know the result, and try something different if it fails.

I hoped something like this would work:

```
primc_config() {
echo "Configuring primecount: building primesieve $1"
sdh_cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON \
          -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF \
          -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
          -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
          -DBUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE=$1 \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/cmake \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY=BOTH \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL \
          ${EXTRA_OPTS} && echo OKOKOK && sdh_make_install
}

set -e
primc_config OFF || primc_config ON
```

but no, if the 1st call to primc_config fails in cmake, it just terminates the script.

Yes, soon, I'd say.
It would just feel a bit excessive to do so just for a single function.

I'll see if the failure on `debian-jessie` is as easy to fix as the other failures were. If not, we can drop `debian-jessie` in 9.5 already, it seems to have a particularly messy compiler.

<a id='comment:81'></a>IMHO the patch for `std:align` should go into `gcc` spkg, not here.
Test if it's there, if not, put it into `std` namespace, instead of patching around all the C++ code
affected by it.

While strictly speaking putting new functions into namespace `std` is undefined behaviour, with gcc is just works (IMHO).
