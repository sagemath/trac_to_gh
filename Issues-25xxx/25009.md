The `prime_pi` function is currently a symbolic function that can hold its argument as in

```
sage: n = SR.var('n')
sage: prime_pi(n)
prime_pi(n)
```
that also contains the Cython code for evaluating it

```
sage: prime_pi(13543)
1603
```
Unfortunately, it is buggy, see #24960 (fixed in #32894, using this ticket). We will promote the spkg `primecount` to standard and use it instead. This ticket does this part, and reverts deprecations from #32412. It also removes obsolete deprecation warning, and the corresponding no longer available parameter.


Upstream patch: https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/pull/107 (rejected)

---
Below is the original part, no longer too relevant.

---
We move the evaluation part as a standalone function in `arith/` and provide alternative implementations
- using `PARI/GP` (only efficient in the range of tabulated primes)
- using the different algorithms in the library primecount that is packaged in #24966

The package `primecount` has been provided with Sage since version 8.3, has been updated several times and is already outdated https://repology.org/project/primecount/versions

Is it time to start using it?

Because `sage.libs.primecount` uses an optional library, in the modularization of sagelib it would have to be split out to a separate package. But since `src/sage/libs/primecount.pxd` and `src/sage/interfaces/primecount.pyx` do not depend on Sage at all (except for a use of `sage.misc.superseded`), it would be best to make it a standalone Python library, like you did with `pplpy`.

I am not sure whether there is much value in the branch `u/vdelecroix/25009-draft`, 
as functions mentioned there are no longer in `primecount.hpp`, they are in `primecount-internal.hpp`, cf. https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount

That is, they are not for public consumption. Let us use this ticket to update and promote the package to standard.

reading https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/-/blob/master/setup.py does not make me wiser, and anyway it's not a good example, as we're building it as a part of sagelib, anyway.

As primecount isn't always available as a system library, there should be some need for configuring paths, etc. 

That all that can be done in 10 minutes is, hmm, a joke.

OK, we actaully should spin off the library primesieve (https://repology.org/project/primesieve/versions) - which is a dependency here, and (by default primecount vendors it, but has an option not to).

Many distros package primesieve separately, so in particular for using system packages it makes perfect sense. (Perhaps primesieve has potentially independent uses in Sage).

Matthias, what is

```

We actually have a catch-22 situation - we cannot reliably configure standard packages with `cmake`, as we don't guarantee its presence at the moment.

So cmake must be promoted to a hard pre-requisite.

I don't mind this, though...

OK, here I need a shell programming advice. The problem I don't know how to solve is that cmake triggers an exit if it fails, so it teminates spkg-install script in case of failure. But I just want to know the result, and try something different if it fails.

I hoped something like this would work:

```
primc_config() {
echo "Configuring primecount: building primesieve $1"
sdh_cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON \
          -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF \
          -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
          -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
          -DBUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE=$1 \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/cmake \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY=BOTH \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL \
          ${EXTRA_OPTS} && echo OKOKOK && sdh_make_install
}

set -e
primc_config OFF || primc_config ON
```

but no, if the 1st call to primc_config fails in cmake, it just terminates the script.

Yes, soon, I'd say.
It would just feel a bit excessive to do so just for a single function.

I'll see if the failure on `debian-jessie` is as easy to fix as the other failures were. If not, we can drop `debian-jessie` in 9.5 already, it seems to have a particularly messy compiler.

IMHO the patch for `std:align` should go into `gcc` spkg, not here.
Test if it's there, if not, put it into `std` namespace, instead of patching around all the C++ code
affected by it.

While strictly speaking putting new functions into namespace `std` is undefined behaviour, with gcc is just works (IMHO).

the compiler is OK in this case, it's STL that it's not.

If I recall correctly, that's how we patched STLs for CGAL back in 1999:

All you need to to is to put `-I foo/bar/` into CXXFLAGS, and put into `foo/bar` a file named `memory`, where one puts `#include <memory>` and an implementation of `align()` inside `namespace std {...}` block.
