CC:  swewers

As a followup to #25397, let's try to shrink coefficients even further, using the ideas from https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/pull/60/files.

This also speeds up things overall. All the valuation tests took 406s on my machine before and now take 314s.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25607

Btw., the doctests in `mclf` still works with this. Very few outputs change because the centers of affinoids are now sightly simpler.

```
Failed example:
    Y.etale_locus()
Expected:
    Affinoid with 3 components:

    Elementary affinoid defined by
    v(x + 7) >= 5/4
    Elementary affinoid defined by

Got:
    Affinoid with 3 components:
    Elementary affinoid defined by 
    v(x) >= 3/4
    Elementary affinoid defined by 
    v(x - 2) >= 5/4
