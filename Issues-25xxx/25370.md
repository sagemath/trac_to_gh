In function `prime_to_m_part(m,n)` from `misc.py` the examples in docstrings 
don't call the function but call an instance method instead.


```
sage: 240.prime_to_m_part(2)
15
```

should be 

```
sage: prime_to_m_part(240,2)
15
```

Note also that integers also have a method with the same name::

    sage: 240.prime_to_m_part(2)

The aim of the documentation is multiple: doctest + user documentation.
