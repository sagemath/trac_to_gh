We are regularly asked by users to provide our documentation
in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The attached branch enables
is an experimental step in this direction, enabling to build
our Sphinx documentation as a collection of cross-linking 
notebooks with:

    sage -pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter
    make ipynb

This uses the following Sphinx plug-in:

    https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter/

which does a much better job than rst2ipynb (in particular it supports crosslinks etc.)

Note that there is still some unavoidadble degrading in the process, given that RST documentation page have intrinsically a tree structure while notebooks are intrinsically linear. Typically nested code blocks within lists or notes are not rendered perfectly.

Future steps:
- [ ] Try the branch and check that it actually works
- [ ] Check the output documentation to evaluate how much we are affected by the degrading
- [ ] Document `ipynb` as build rule and docbuild target
- [ ] Build and publish the notebooks on Sage's web page / binder
- [ ] Build the notebooks by default?
- [ ] Add links to the jupyter notebooks from the HTML documentation and/or from the Jupyter Help menu?
