There are various instances in Sage of code like

```
someclass.ParentMethods.method.__func__
```
This is because we typically want to get the actual function from the `ParentMethods` body without binding to `ParentMethods`. This may apply to more general descriptors besides functions.

To solve this, I propose a new function `rawattr()` which is like `getattr()` but without binding.

Hi Jeroen,

I agree that the idiom is not great :-)
(though it makes explicit that something non trivial is happening)

Do you have a way to implement your proposition without having to specify a super class or metaclass in each and every `XXXMethods` class?

I don't think so. My idea would be to replace

```
class ParentMethods:
```
by

```
class ParentMethods(Namespace):
```

Of course, the current code works so it's not required to do that change everywhere. I would suggest to do the change only when needed.

Thanks for investigating this. I definitely see the point of trying to improve the idiom which expose an implementation detail about bound/unbound methods.

The risk is that a developper will see the idiom (without `__func__`) in the target class, try to replicate it, without noticing that there is something special to be done in the original class.

I would be more in favor of a local and explicit idiom like:

```
    foo = unbind(Bars.ParentMethods.foo)
```
or

```
    foo = get_unbound(Bars.ParentMethod, "foo")
```

where we would use `unbind` to hide the implementation details and support any kind of object,
not just methods.

What do you think? Opinions anyone else?

This wouldn't simply because you cannot "unbind" arbitrary objects. Imagine

```
class X:
    @property
    def answer(self):
        return 42
```
There is no way to unbind `42` to the `property` object `X.answer`.

`get_unbound` would work: it's essentially a one-liner to implement that because it's exactly what the C API function `_PyType_Lookup` does. It gets the bare attribute from a class and it doesn't fancy stuff like `__get__` or `__getattr__` or metaclass shenanigans.

This would only help to implement fake inheritance, it wouldn't help to check for inheritance for example.

What I like about `rawattr()` is that it's very general: it works both on instances (which would give bound methods) and on classes (which would give unbound methods).

So what's wrong with

```
def getattr_raw(obj, attr, default=None):
    return obj.__dict__.get(attr, default)
```
?

(I think the real implementation is a little more complicated than that but not by much).  Incidentally I prefer a name that still contains `getattr` making it clearer that it's like `getattr` but more direct.  The problem with "rawattr" IMO is there's no verb in the name.  That's a triviality though.

I'm not sure I understand your question.

If your question is "why don't you simply implement `rawattr` (whatever the name) like this?", then my answer is:

1. It doesn't get attributes from subclasses.

2. It only looks up the attribute in the instance, not in the class.

If your question is "why does `rawattr` need to support subclasses?", then my answer is: that's what normal attribute lookup also does.

If your question is "why does `rawattr` look both in the instance and in the class?", then my answer is: it makes it convenient to replace `__func__` regardless of whether the method was bound or unbound.

I don't like anything referring to "bound" since that's very specific to methods.  It could also apply to other descriptors (e.g. I have written descriptors that are "bound" to a specific instance of a class when accessed through the instance).  But that's just one pattern for descriptors and isn't necessarily applicable in all cases.

I can't recall where, but I've seen this spelled `raw_getattr()` before.  Similarly, Sphinx has a `safe_getattr()`, but that serves a different purpose.

This is partly why I'm also confused about how this function is documented:

```
+    Like ``getattr(obj, name)`` but without binding the attribute to
+    the object. This can be used to easily get unbound methods or other
+    descriptors.
```

There's nothing about `getattr()` that has to do with "binding the attribute to the object".  That wording is really confusing to me and makes me not understand what this is supposed to do.  It's somewhat applicable to methods but not to all attributes by any means.

I guess my own reading is influenced by the first line of the 
[Descriptor How To](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html):

```
    In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding behavior”
```

No idea what the average reading will be though.

I am starting to think that a `super`-like syntax might be better: something like `namespace(obj).attr` instead of `raw_getattr(obj, "attr")`.

Advantages:

1. It allows specifying the attribute name in a more natural way, not as string.

2. `namespace(obj)` is an object which can be created once (and even stored or passed around) in case that you need to access many raw attributes of the same object.

3. Usable as class decorator to create namespace "classes" (whether this would still be a class or not remains to be seen).

The main disadvantage is that it would be more complicated to implement and slower.

Did you forget that 2.7 is still the default and only supported version?


EDIT: I guess you meant 3.x with x < 3.

I don't think that there is anything wrong with using `_PyObject_GetDictPtr`. It does exactly what I want. I don't need to create the dict when it's not there and I don't need exceptions thrown when the object does not support `__dict__`.

And it only works on Python 3, so it would only complicate the code.

If you insist, I will use it though.

Yes, it **could** be written in Python. It **could** also be written in C.

You seem to find it a problem that it's implemented in C but I don't understand why. I would argue that the C implementation is conceptually simpler than the potential Python implementation because Python doesn't have the equivalent of `_PyType_Lookup`.
