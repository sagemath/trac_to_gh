There are various instances in Sage of code like

```
someclass.ParentMethods.method.__func__
```
This is because we typically want to get the actual function from the `ParentMethods` body without binding to `ParentMethods`. This may apply to more general descriptors besides functions.

To solve this, I propose a new function `rawattr()` which is like `getattr()` but without binding.

Hi Jeroen,

I agree that the idiom is not great :-)
(though it makes explicit that something non trivial is happening)

Do you have a way to implement your proposition without having to specify a super class or metaclass in each and every `XXXMethods` class?

I don't think so. My idea would be to replace

```
class ParentMethods:
```
by

```
class ParentMethods(Namespace):
```

Of course, the current code works so it's not required to do that change everywhere. I would suggest to do the change only when needed.

Thanks for investigating this. I definitely see the point of trying to improve the idiom which expose an implementation detail about bound/unbound methods. However I am reluctant with the current solution. Somehow it's too unlocal and non explicit. The risk is that a developper will see the idiom (without `__func__`) in the target class, try to replicate it, without noticing that there is something special to be done in the original class.

I would be more in favor of a local and explicit idiom like:

```
    foo = unbind(Bars.ParentMethods.foo)
```
or

```
    foo = get_unbound(Bars.ParentMethod, "foo")
```

where we would use `unbind` to hide the implementation details and support any kind of object,
not just methods.

What do you think? Opinions anyone else?

This wouldn't simply because you cannot "unbind" arbitrary objects. Imagine

```
class X:
    @property
    def answer(self):
        return 42
```
There is no way to unbind `42` to the `property` object `X.answer`.

`get_unbound` would work: it's essentially a one-liner to implement that because it's exactly what the C API function `_PyType_Lookup` does. It gets the bare attribute from a class and it doesn't fancy stuff like `__get__` or `__getattr__` or metaclass shenanigans.

So what's wrong with

```
def getattr_raw(obj, attr, default=None):
    return obj.__dict__.get(attr, default)
```
?

(I think the real implementation is a little more complicated than that but not by much).  Incidentally I prefer a name that still contains `getattr` making it clearer that it's like `getattr` but more direct.  The problem with "rawattr" IMO is there's no verb in the name.

I'm not sure I understand your question.

If your question is "why don't you simply implement `rawattr` (whatever the name) like this?", then my answer is:

1. It doesn't get attributes from subclasses.

2. It only looks up the attribute in the instance, not in the class.

If your question is "why does `rawattr` need to support subclasses?", then my answer is: that's what normal attribute lookup also does.

If your question is "why does `rawattr` look both in the instance and in the class?", then my answer is: it makes it convenient to replace `__func__` regardless of whether the method was bound or unbound.

Hi Erik, Jeroen,

The `rawattr` approach sounds more explicit, versatile and local than the class decorator.

Nice point to have an idiom analoguous to one that many developers will already know (`getattr`); it helps build quickly a mental model. So maybe a good name could be something like `getattr_unbounded`, or `get_unbounded_attr`.

I don't have a strong opinion for whether it should lookup just the class or also the super classes. In the use cases I met the former is sufficient, but the latter would not hurt. Performance does not matter, since the code will be executed just a couple times when reading the file. The latter hides an implementation detail (where exactly the method is implemented), enabling to move it up when appropriate; that's good. And if we decide to rely on the analogy with `getattr`, we might as well be as analogous as possible.

Cheers,
                      Nicolas

Ah, right, good point:-) I somehow confused myself with documentation lookup where 'a.foo?' actually gets the object by name and therefore can retrieve the unbound object.

I don't like anything referring to "bound" since that's very specific to methods.  It could also apply to other descriptors (e.g. I have written descriptors that are "bound" to a specific instance of a class when accessed through the instance).  But that's just one pattern for descriptors and isn't necessarily applicable in all cases.

This is partly why I'm also confused about how this function is documented:

```
+    Like ``getattr(obj, name)`` but without binding the attribute to
+    the object. This can be used to easily get unbound methods or other
+    descriptors.
```

There's nothing about `getattr()` that has to do with "binding the attribute to the object".  That wording is really confusing to me and makes me not understand what this is supposed to do.  It's somewhat applicable to methods but not to all attributes by any means.

I guess my own reading is influenced by the first line of the 
[Descriptor How To](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html):

```
    In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with “binding behavior”
```

No idea what the average reading will be though.

I don't think that the implementation is complicated at all. I actually think it would be *more* complicated in pure Python since pure Python has no equivalent for `_PyType_Lookup`.

Sorry, yes, I should clarify "complicated".  In part I mean that it's implemented in C, though I don't believe that alone makes it complicated.  I'm more concerned about the over-reliance on undocumented internals.

I could just as easily write this function in pure Python, and I *would* be interested in a performance comparison between a pure python version and this C version, but I could try doing that myself.

To be clear I'm otherwise +1 on this--that's my only misgiving at this point.

I am starting to think that a `super`-like syntax might be better: something like `namespace(obj).attr` instead of `raw_getattr(obj, "attr")`.

Advantages:

1. It allows specifying the attribute name in a more natural way, not as string.

2. `namespace(obj)` is an object which can be created once (and even stored or passed around) in case that you need to access many raw attributes of the same object.

3. Usable as class decorator to create namespace "classes" (whether this would still be a class or not remains to be seen).

The main disadvantage is that it would be more complicated to implement and slower.

Did you forget that 2.7 is still the default and only supported version?

Yes, it **could** be written in Python. It **could** also be written in C.
