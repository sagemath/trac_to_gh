In #17851 we disabled Cython caching. We should fix the underlying issues:

* ~~https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1397~~
* ~~https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1399~~
* ~~https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1393~~
* and move the cython cache to a Sage specific directory #25293

And then enable caching again :)

See #25292 for the Cython upgrade (when it comes out)

Depends on #25292

Depends on #25293

I have no problem if sage-the-distribution upgrades to Cython 0.29; I just think it shouldn't *depend* on it unconditionally.  E.g. it would be good to use a version check before enabling features like this that depend on a specific Cython version.
