There is 

```
.. MATH::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{align}
      1+...+n &= n(n+1)/2\\
      &= O(n^2)\\
   \end{tabular}
```

See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#section-latex-typeset

The word `tabular` should be replaced by `align` in the doc block, as it is in the corresponding interpreted latex block.
