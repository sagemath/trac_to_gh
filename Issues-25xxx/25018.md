Here is the command that I entered to trigger this bug

```
sage: list(Words(1,1)[0].shuffle([2]))
[None, None]
```
The class sage.combinat.words.shuffle_product.ShuffleProduct_w1w2 tries to cast the output of the call in the parent of `w1` but if it fails, it outputs `None` rather than something else.

Of course what we should see in that example is

```
sage: list(Word([1]).shuffle([2]))
[word: 12, word: 21]
```
The problem is the parent of `Words(1,1)[0]` is

```
sage: Words(1,1)[0].parent()
Finite words over {1}
```
and the output of the shuffle contains 1 and 2 and so the offending code in `ShuffleProduct_w1w2`

```
        try:
            return self._w1.parent()(res)
        except ValueError:
            # Special situation: the parent of w1 is too
            # restrictive to be cast on res.
            if isinstance(self._w1.parent(), Compositions_n):
                return Compositions(res)
```
has the problem that since it can't make `[1,2]` into a `finite words over {1}` and it isn't a composition, then it doesn't do anything.

The simple solution is just to add the line `return res` (which will just be a list in the case that the other checks fail) at the end of the except clause.

We could also check that `isinstance(w1.parent(),FiniteWords)` and if that is the case call `return Word(res)` and if it fails then just `return res`.

I think I will take a little more care with this.  This code is generating bad parents right now and this could just push the error down the road.

```
sage: A = Compositions(6, inner=[2,3])[0]
sage: [B in B.parent() for B in A.shuffle_product([1])]
[False, False, False]
```

If I am not mistaken, this is actually a problem with the `Composition` code since this isn't right:

```
sage: Compositions(6, inner=[2,3])([2,2,2,2,2])
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
sage: _.parent()
Compositions of the integer 6 satisfying constraints inner=[2, 3]
```

TBH I prefer a new doctest rather than editing the old one. But I don't have an opinion on the parent issue... this is a design issue. How do `Partitions' do it? Do their parents also reflect all the restrictions that were placed when they were generated?

sage: B = Partitions(4,max_part=2)([3,1])
sage: B in B.parent()
False

Please look carefully at the lines I changed and at the lines just above those.  The same doc test was repeated twice so I have not removed anything.  Instead I changed the second doctest so that it does what the sentence says it does.  In between the two repeated doctests, it was written (just above where I changed it):

```
        Sage is no longer confused by a too-restrictive parent
        of `I` when shuffling two compositions `I` and `J`
        (cf. :trac:`15131`)::
```
So I corrected the doctest below that sentence so that it does what that sentence says.

I am 99.9% sure that this is what the original author of those lines (you) meant to put there before and unfortunately it was just missing the 3-4 characters that would have triggered the bug.

If you want, I can add a different doctest.
