<a id='comment:2'></a>
You have too much data in your `__hash__`:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f0 = 4*x^5 - 30*x^3 + 45*x - 22
sage: C0 = HyperellipticCurve(f0)
sage: P.<x> = RR[]
sage: f1 = 4*x^5 - 30*x^3 + 45*x - 22
sage: C1 = HyperellipticCurve(f1)
sage: C1 == C0
True
sage: hash(C1) == hash(C0)
False
```
So you definitely have to remove `_PP` from the hash, and I would probably remove both the `__class__` as subclasses are not used in the `__eq__` comparison.

My understanding behind the default hash is that every object has a `repr` and generally two objects that compare equal have equal `repr` output.

I don't use/know this code, so we probably have to ask someone who understands it better to confirm if you're worried enough.

I had the same doubt before.  There's some inconsistency throughout Sage about when some objects defined over different fields are considered equal under `==`.  In some cases it's quite deliberate, in other cases it's not clear until and unless the original author chimes in.

I agree with Alex: to be equal the fields of definition should equal and the defining polynomials identical.  This is the case with elliptic curves:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,1])
sage: E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1 over Rational Field
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: EK = E.change_ring(K)
sage: EK
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 1 over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: E == EK
False
sage: hash(E)
8741953973726
sage: hash(EK)
8741951786400
```
I don't know what this hash function actually does: it calls hash_by_id, whatever that is.  I also don't know how to find out what function is being called by E==EK either!

I propose a solution : simply remove `__eq__`, `__ne__` and `__hash__` here.

Then they are all provided by the general setting of projective subschemes, which seems to be a good idea. This will compare ambient spaces and defining ideals, which amount to compare base field and polynomials.

True.  Is that case common enough to merit a special case?  Are there cases of ideals of rings over these types of p-adics whose ideal would be generated by more than one polynomials (and hence would still crash on the existing code)?

What I'm saying is just, why not:

```python
try:
    same_gens = set(self.gens()) == set(other.gens())
except TypeError:
    same_gens = False

if same_gens:
    # Do whatever we do currently
else:
    # Do whatever is necessary to compare the gens (construct a GB, etc).
```

Certainly:  in ZZ_p[X] the ideal generated by p and X.  But the number of gens will always be small, so why not sort the gens, however many there are?

This is an example of a common problem in Sage and other systems.  If I define two ideals (or other structures) in different ways and ask whether they are equal then the test may be very expensive.  But here we just test whether they have been presented in the same way (or with trivial changes such as changing the order of the generators).

That could still crash.  I don't know the math well enough to construct an interestingexample case, but say you have two copies of the same ideal, but their generators just happen to be in a different order, as in:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: R.ideal(x, y).gens()
[x, y]
sage: R.ideal(y, x).gens()
```

This is the sort of case, as John wrote, that the `set()` call is intended for in the first place.  But if the elements `x` and `y` are not hashable, then the first test will still fail, and then the second test will be evaluated and will crash.

IMO this comparison of gens() is just a special case shortcut which is fine as-is, but it should account for the possibility that some elements just aren't hashable, that's all.
