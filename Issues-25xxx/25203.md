Something like this takes forever:

```
sage: GF(2^1000).zeta(3)
```
This is because `k.zeta()` is implemented by taking the power of a multiplicative generator, but computing a multiplicative generator can take a very long time (it requires factoring `q-1`).

Instead, we implement a new function `_element_of_factored_order` and implement both `zeta` and `multiplicative_generator` using that.
