Something like this takes forever:

```
sage: GF(2^1000).zeta(3)
```
This is because `k.zeta()` is implemented by taking the power of a multiplicative generator, but computing a multiplicative generator can take a very long time (it requires factoring `q-1`).

Instead, we implement a new function `_element_of_factored_order` and implement both `zeta` and `multiplicative_generator` using that.

The doctest

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^2000)
sage: p = 8877945148742945001146041439025147034098690503591013177336356694416517527310181938001
sage: z = k.zeta(p)
sage: z ^ p
1
```
is not wonderful as it might well be that `z = 1`. Sadly `z.multiplicative_order()` does not terminate.
