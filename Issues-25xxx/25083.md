Among other improvements in these bugfix releases, the
[IPython 5.x release notes](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/5.x/whatsnew/version5.html)
mention that

- IPython should start faster, as it no longer looks for all available
  pygments styles on startup ([PR #10859](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10859/)).

- Update inspecting function/methods for future-proofing (a patch meant for Sage).

Such Github-auto-generated "releases" are just an export of the git repo. They are typically **not** suitable as source tarball. For Python packages, the authoritative source is PyPI.

Okay, I didn't realize that. I'll keep it in mind.
The release notes and PyPI releases are at:

- http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version5.html
- https://pypi.org/project/ipython/#history

Do we have any indication whether 5.8 is soon to be released?
