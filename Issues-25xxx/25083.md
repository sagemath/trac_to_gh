- IPython should start faster, as it no longer looks for all available
  pygments styles on startup ([PR #10859](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10859/)).

- Update inspecting function/methods for future-proofing (a patch meant for Sage).

Okay, I didn't realize that. I'll keep it in mind.
The release notes and PyPI releases are at:

- http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version5.html
- https://pypi.org/project/ipython/#history

Do we have any indication whether 5.8 is soon to be released?
