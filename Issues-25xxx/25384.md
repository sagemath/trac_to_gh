```
We should make it so that `sage --jupyter` calls the `jupyter`
shipped by Sage, and thus make it possible to do things like

```
sage --jupyter kernelspec install /path/to/some_jupyter_kernel
```
and so on.

Likewise, the following converts a ipynb file to a html slides presentation:

```
sage -ipython nbconvert filename.ipynb --to slides 
[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | Subcommand `ipython nbconvert` is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | You likely want to use `jupyter nbconvert` in the future
```
and it would be nice to be able to run

```
sage --jupyter nbconvert filename.ipynb --to slides
```
but it currently gives the following error:

```
sage-run received unknown option: --jupyter
usage: sage [options]
Try 'sage -h' for more information.
```

The list of external programs we can run with `sage -<program>`
or `sage --<program>` is obtained by running

```
sage --advanced
```

It's not that `jupyter nbconvert` is not known, it's that we don't provide
