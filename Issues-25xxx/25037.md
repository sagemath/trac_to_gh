I think that this

```
     # Touch all includes such that dependency checking works properly:
     # the timestamp of the includes should be *now*, not the time when
     # the NTL package was created.
-    touch "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/NTL/*
+    touch "$SAGE_DESTDIR_LOCAL"/include/NTL/*
```
is actually fixed by your changes to the tarball extraction, fixing the timestamps to the time of installation.
