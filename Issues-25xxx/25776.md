```
sage: G
Genus of
[ 2  0  0]
[ 0  2  0]
[ 0  0 64]
Genus symbol at 2:    [2^2]_1 :[64^1]_1
```

The correct symbol is

``` 
[2^2]_2:[64^1]_1 
```
Moreover the signature should be printed and 
if the representative is very large it can be suppressed.

Keywords: genus

I just noticed another bug:

```
sage: a=matrix.diagonal([1,3])
sage: b=matrix(ZZ,2,[2,1,1,2])*2
sage: c = matrix.block_diagonal([a,b])
sage: Genus(c)
Genus of
[1 0|0 0]
[0 3|0 0]
[---+---]
[0 0|4 2]
[0 0|2 4]
Genus symbol at 2:    [1^2]_02^2 
Genus symbol at 3:     1^2 3^2
``` 
Here
`Genus symbol at 2:    [1^2]_0 2^2 `
is better.

Also it would be good to print the signature of the quadratic form and
moreover if the representative is greater than ``20 x 20`` or something to suppress it - just like our matrices.
