If `a` is an element in a finite extension `K` of `Qp`, the call `a.minimal_polynomial('x')` returns the minimal polynomial of `a` over `K` (which is always a polynomial degree `1`) whereas it should return the minimal polynomial of `a` over `Qp`.

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(5^3)
sage: a.minimal_polynomial('x')
(1 + O(5^20))*x + 4*a + 4*a*5 + ... + 4*a*5^19 + O(5^20)

sage: L.<pi> = Qp(5).extension(x^2-5)
sage: pi.minimal_polynomial('x')
(1 + O(pi^40))*x + 4*pi + 4*pi^3 + ... + 4*pi^39 + O(pi^41)
```
