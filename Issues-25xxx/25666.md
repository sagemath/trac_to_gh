<a id='comment:19'></a>Done.
Performance check has been done with :

```
sage: f(x,a) = 1/(a+x^2)
sage: %time l=[numerical_integral(f, 1, 2, max_points=100000, params=[n]) for n in range(10000)]
CPU times: user 2.93 s, sys: 176 ms, total: 3.11 s
Wall time: 3.1 s
```

And as you predicted the modification seems to be harmless.

Tell me if you have an example to maximize the number of sample points required.

I give positive review to commits `39e4ea2`, ​`99e76a3` and `4e3eafc`.
