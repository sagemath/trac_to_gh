This meta-ticket lists tickets opened for failing doctests involving **internet**, **optional** and/or **external** packages as discovered by running:

```
sage -tp --optional=sage,optional,external --all
```

Many issues are related to internet (running them is activated by the tag `external` in the above command) which can be specifically tested with the following command:

```
sage -tp --optional=sage,internet --all
```

**Tickets**

Still open tickets:

* #34683 1 **internet** doctest failing in repl/interpreter.py

**Reports**

Many of the above tickets originated in reports of failing doctests
on the sage-release mailing list, after the release announcement for
various development versions of Sage. See for instance:

- [sage-release thread for Sage 8.3.beta6](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/P6weuTHdIbE/X3G-tIcpBgAJ)
- [sage-release thread for Sage 8.3.beta3](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/l635YEuT7Hs/WkHCnmWhAQAJ)
