Currently, the iterator looks like this. 

```
def __iter__(self):

    from sage.sets.recursively_enumerated_set import RecursivelyEnumeratedSet
    return iter(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds=[self.one()],
                successors=lambda g: (g._mul_(h) for h in self.gens())))
```

Perhaps it would be faster to use a strong_generating_system to iterate through the group.

I added an alternative suggestion `__iter_alt__` in the patch. However, sometimes calculation the  strong_generating_system takes much longer than actually iterating with the standard iterator above. Here are some timing experiments:

```
sage: p = [(i,i+1) for i in range(1,601,2)]
sage: q = [tuple(range(1+i,601,3)) for i in range(3)]
sage: A = PermutationGroup([p,q])
sage: A.cardinality()
60000
sage: time len(list(A))
CPU times: user 441 ms, sys: 58 ms, total: 499 ms
Wall time: 478 ms
60000
sage: time len(list(A.__iter_alt__()))
CPU times: user 3.39 s, sys: 690 ms, total: 4.08 s
Wall time: 4.1 s
60000
sage: P = PermutationGroup(SymmetricGroup(10).gens())
sage: time len(list(P))
CPU times: user 9.06 s, sys: 182 ms, total: 9.24 s
Wall time: 9.24 s
3628800
sage: time len(list(P.__iter_alt__()))
CPU times: user 3.64 s, sys: 144 ms, total: 3.79 s
Wall time: 3.79 s
3628800
```

Any suggestions? What are good other groups to do benchmarking?

You can probably get some more speed by doing the initial step in the `__iter__` function and then do the remaining steps with `SGS` being explicitly given. It is probably faster to also do

```sage
            S = SGS.pop()
            if not SGS:
                for g in S:
                    yield g
            else:
                for s in elements(self, SGS):
                    for g in S:
                        yield s._mul_(g)

I don't quite follow. We would still have to compute SGS in this case, won't we? This seems to be the slow part, at least in the first example above with 60000 elements.

That makes it a little faster, thanks!

done.

I also made some tests and think that the permutation group method `strong_generating_system` is much slower than necessary (see the above example where this algo is slower than the brute force). In particular, there is a lot of talking back and forth between sage and gap. Anyway, for my purposes, this is a non-issue. `@`Dima, do you know how to **easily** make this method fast?

Could you provide a code snippet in the above example of how to do that?

> And why not using StrongGeneratorsStabChain that is builtin in GAP?

Because this provides a list of strong generators for the stabilizer chain, but not a list of coset reprs:

```
gap> P := Group([(1,2),(1,2,3,4)]);
Group([ (1,2), (1,2,3,4) ])
gap> S := StabChain(P);
<stabilizer chain record, Base [ 1, 2, 3 ], Orbit length 4, Size: 24>
gap> CosetsStabChain(S);
[ [ () ], [ (), (3,4) ], [ (), (2,4,3), (2,3,4) ], [ (), (1,4)(2,3), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4) ] ]
gap> StrongGeneratorsStabChain(S);
[ (3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2)(3,4), (1,4)(2,3) ]

Historically, little attention was paid to the problem at hand, and indeed, iteration over all the elements of a group G, rather than doing something more intelligent, is almost surely an indication of something done without enough thought. 

E.g., 

* would knowing the coset representatives of a subgroup H<G and generators for H suffice?
* would knowing the words in generators rather than permutations suffice?
* can an adavntage be taken of a short [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(group_theory)) for G?

Before comparing any of these functions, we should have a way to fast translate gap permutations to sage permutations. Otherwise, this would even much more so spoil the use of the gap function `Elements` which then results in all permutations to be translated from gap to sage.

Here are some preliminary timings for the Coxeter group of type `E7`:

In gap, the iteration needs 9.2 secs:

```

while in sage, it only takes 4.3 secs of which 0.7 secs are spend constructing the strong generating system:

```
sage: P = CoxeterGroup(["E",7], implementation="permutation")
sage: %time X = P.strong_generating_system(P.base())
CPU times: user 632 ms, sys: 71.6 ms, total: 703 ms
Wall time: 718 ms

sage: P = CoxeterGroup(["E",7], implementation="permutation")
sage: %time len(list(P.__iter_alt__()))
CPU times: user 4.11 s, sys: 208 ms, total: 4.32 s
Wall time: 4.34 s
2903040
```
So I expect this to go down below 4 sec if we speed the strong generating system.

Do you know that GAP actually has iterators?
With P as in comment 31:

```
gap> si:=IteratorStabChain(StabChain(P));
<iterator>
gap> l:=[];;
gap> for i in si do Add(l,i); od;

```
is about 30% faster than `Elements(P)` - the latter actually will also sort the elements, perhaps that's why.

Moreover, in `for i` loop about 60% of time is taken by `Add()`.
(I measured this by replacing `Add()` by a counter increment).

> I suspect it won't work correctly if SGS's elements are not involutions.

This is not correct if I understand it correctly. In particular, the elements in the SGS are usually not only involutions, for example

```
sage: S = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3)])
sage: S.strong_generating_system()
[[(), (1,2,3), (1,3,2)], [(), (2,3)], [()]]
```
and the SGS is **not** a generating set for the group itself.
Another example of a cyclic group is

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2,3,4)])
sage: for elt in P.__iter_alt__(): print elt
()
(1,4,3,2)
(1,3)(2,4)
(1,2,3,4)
```
and the stabilizer chain is trivial (i.e., the chain of cosets is a single coset of the trivial subgroup).

Sorry, I am slightly lost now in what you are asking -- let me try to answer anyway.

Let S be a permutation group in sage. The current iterator `for g in S` iterates by a brute force algorithm through the elements keeping the complete group in memory to check if an element was seen before.

The new algorithm reimplements the algorithm used in gap, and indeed takes the important ingredients from gap. gap computes a chain ` e = S1 in S2 in ... in Sk = S` of subgroups (obtained using the Schreier-Sims algorithm) for which the cosets of `Si` inside ` S{i+1} ` are particularly easy to compute.
This yields a sequence of cosets `[e]=C1, C2, ..., Ck` such that every element in `S` has a unique representation `g = g1*...*gk` for `gi in Ci`.

In sage, the new algorithm is to

* directly compute in gap the list `C1, C2, ..., Ck`
* translate the elements in all these lists to sage (this takes too long and should be improved)
* produce an iterator for all elements in `S` by iterating over all products of elements in these lists.

Let me know if you meant something else...

No, `S = SGS.pop()` so `S = Ci` is the next layer of coset representatives. Let us go through the code with the notation as above:

```
        def elements(SGS):
            S = SGS.pop()
            if not SGS:
                for g in S:
                    yield g
            else:
                for s in elements(SGS):
                    for g in S:
                        yield s._mul_(g)
```
Given such a sequence `SGS = C1,C2,...,Ci`, `elements(SGS)` iterates over all elements in `Si`. This is done by recursively doing the computation for `C1,C2,..,C{i-1} ` and then yielding all elements in `S{i-1} ` multiplied with all elements in `S=Ci`.

`if not SGS` means that we have reached the trivial subgroup and `S = [()]`. So the first `for g in S: yield g` could be replaced with `yield S[0]`.

You can have a look at [CossidentePenttilaGraph()](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/854f9764d14236110b8d7f7b35a7d52017e044f8/src/sage/graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py#L1222) for the use of `libgap.function_factory` (so that you can basically call your own GAP function via libgap).

So you can change your code as follows:

```
gap_cosets = libgap.function_factory("""function ( S0 )
    local   CosetsStabChain;
    CosetsStabChain := function(S)  # for the recursive call
    local   cosets,             # element list, result
            new_coset,          #
            pnt,                # point in the orbit of <S>
            rep;                # inverse representative for that point

    # if <S> is trivial then it is easy
    if Length(S.generators) = 0  then
        cosets := [ [S.identity] ];

    # otherwise
    else

        # compute the elements of the stabilizer
        cosets := CosetsStabChain( S.stabilizer );

        # loop over all points in the orbit
        new_coset := [];
        for pnt  in S.orbit  do

            # add the corresponding coset to the set of elements
            rep := S.identity;
            while S.orbit[1] ^ rep <> pnt  do
                 rep := LeftQuotient( S.transversal[pnt/rep], rep );
            od;
            Add( new_coset, rep );
        od;
        Add( cosets, new_coset );
   fi;

   # return the result
   return cosets;
   end;
   return CosetsStabChain(S0);
end;""")
```
Now one can do

```
sage: G=libgap.AlternatingGroup(4)
sage: S=G.StabChain()
sage: gap_cosets(S)
[ [ () ], [ (), (2,4,3), (2,3,4) ], [ (), (1,4,3), (1,3,4), (1,2,4) ] ]
```

another useful thing is syntax like `G=libgap(PermutationGroup([(1,2)]))` to convert
from Sage's group (implemented with pexpect GAP, I gather) to libgap.

Thank you, Dima! I did these changes together with tons of small changes that had a huge impact on the running time.

Beside this, I arrived at the following, and wonder if this is okay doing: Given I have

* a `PermutationGroupElement` "sample" and
* a `list` "new_perm" representing a permutation in one-line notation in the *same permutation group* as "sample"

It seems that, oddly, we do not have a fast way of generating new permutations from these lists, despite the fact that we can multiply permutations very fast. I thus provide a new `PermutationGroupElement` method `_generate_new` that basically takes a copy from the given `PermutationGroupElement` and only overwrites its underlying c list. The code is basically copied from `_mul_`.

An example would be

```
sage: S = PermutationGroup(SymmetricGroup(4).gens())
sage: sample = S([2,3,4,1])
sage: lst1 = []
sage: lst2 = [2,1]
sage: lst3 = [4,3,2,1]
sage: pi1 = sample._generate_new(lst1); pi1
()
sage: pi2 = sample._generate_new(lst2); pi2
(1,2)
sage: pi3 = sample._generate_new(lst3); pi3
(1,4)(2,3)
```

I set this to "needs review" for a technical review of the code where I still hope for input for improvements (which will not only be relevant for my particular purpose!).

Once this is settled, I propose to use the now `PermutationGroup` iterator per default (and I would also be interested in examples where the old iterator is still faster).

Let me remark that the biggest performance boost came from generating new permutation group elements from old using the new `_generate_new` method. The use of libGAP also played a role, though.

> i.e. that mul call on permutations in `__iter_alt__`, is it actually in (lib)GAP?

No, this is pure cython and uses `PermutationGroupElement._mul_(left, _right)`, no (lib)GAP involved here.

Since both algorithms are the same, and the strong generating set in the Sage version is taken through libGAP, I suspect that the time advantage of Sage really comes from this superfast cython multiplication of permutation group elements.

> I thought that libgap has a fast method to convert GAP permutations to Sage

This is not the case: libgap uses `GapElement_Permutation.sage` which returns `PermutationGroupElement(libgap.ListPerm(self).sage())`, so it goes through the ordinary permutation group element constructor that is **very** slow because of tons of checks. This is why I wrote `_generate_new` that just uses the data from a given element and overwrites its c array containing the permutation:

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4)])
sage: one = P.one()
sage: l = [4,3,2,1]
sage: %timeit P(l)
1000 loops, best of 3: 579 µs per loop
sage: %timeit one._generate_new(l)
The slowest run took 39.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 203 ns per loop
```

OK, thanks - it's not immediately clear with all that methods using `_gap_` in that class.

Anyhow, I don't understand why libGAP creates `PermutationGroupElement` rather than 
a `Permutation`.
It would be natural to me to have this as the default,
mostly as it does not involve constructing a parent (GAP permutations don't really have parents in GAP, they are all in every `SymmetricGroup()` of degree at least `LargestMovedPoint()` of the permutation.
Then your hack can be used for fast libgap->Sage conversion of permutations.

I agree, this would get down the speed quite a bit

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)])
sage: l = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
sage: %timeit P(l, check=False)
The slowest run took 7.58 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 44.3 µs per loop

The slowest run took 7.85 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.74 µs per loop
```
but my hack would not work in this case because it uses the c structure underlying `PermutationGroupElement` which doesn't exist (caution: haven't rechecked!) for `Permutation`, and this hack is possibly still an order of magnitude faster

```
sage: one = P.one()
sage: %timeit one._generate_new(l)
The slowest run took 128.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 241 ns per loop
```

Okay, now everything is as fast as I was expecting it to be possible! I now do not create a sage list from the libgap list and then fill a `<int*>` with this data, but create the latter directly from the libgap list entries. This removes all the overhead!

Here are the new timings:

```
sage: p = [(i,i+1) for i in range(1,601,2)]
....: q = [tuple(range(1+i,601,3)) for i in range(3)]
....: A = PermutationGroup([p,q])
....: A.cardinality()
....: 
60000
sage: i=0
sage: %time for _ in A.__iter__(): i+=1
CPU times: user 512 ms, sys: 40.3 ms, total: 552 ms
Wall time: 543 ms
sage: i
60000
sage: i=0
sage: %time for _ in A.__iter_alt__(): i+=1
CPU times: user 132 ms, sys: 23.7 ms, total: 156 ms
Wall time: 137 ms
sage: i
60000
sage: %time X = A.strong_generating_system(A.base())
CPU times: user 3.5 s, sys: 675 ms, total: 4.17 s
Wall time: 4.22 s
sage: [ len(x) for x in X ]
[600, 100]
sage: %time Y = A.strong_generating_system(implementation="gap")
CPU times: user 38.3 ms, sys: 129 µs, total: 38.5 ms
Wall time: 38.2 ms
sage: [ len(y) for y in Y ]
[1, 100, 600]

I consider it **wrong** to define (as I did) the method `_generate_perm(self, old)` for `libGAP_List` (handing over a `PermutationGroupElement old`. I think it should rather exist a method `_generate_new_libgap(self, gaplst` for `PermutationGroupElement` that takes as input a `libGAP_List gaplst`.

I was not able to do that due to import errors and my ignorance how to properly cast the objects into the correct types, but this seems only a matter of proper coding in `cython`. `@`Travis or `@`Dima, could you help with this?

I think once this is settled, the code is ready for review!

`@`Moritz: rather incredible speedup compared to your original call of `strong_generating_system`, hm?

I am still waiting for someone to have a look at this...

In principle, I think this implementation is a strong improvement to permutation groups in Sage, and since I am not very good in optimizing in cython, there might a few simple improvements left to be found. I don't think it is ready for a positive review, but it certainly is for a review of the technical details.

Could you post a branch with this import problem?
It'd be much quicker to see what's going on this way?
(it need not become the new branch on this ticket, certainly)

compiling, or also running sage? I got the import error as in [comment:80](#comment%3A80) only when running sage.

> Does one really need to make it cpdef? Perhaps start with cdef, make a cpdef wrapper then?

I could try this, but it seems so simple: I have a cpdef function on class A that takes an element of class B as second argument, and I want to move this to a cpdef function on class B that takes an element of class A as second argument...

you see there libgap.so.4, so it can find the symbols there...

Surely it's some declaration missing somewhere, and that's all.
Or, perhaps, the corresponding GAP function should somehow be blessed in libgap extension.

No, this just means we have to ask people who know Cython better.
It must be totally trivial to fix.

I have an idea how it is done via setup.py, but here it's done in some other way, and cannot see any trace anywhere of how and why libgap.so extension gets linked to the correct dynamic library.

No, I want to obtain an optimized way to create a `PermutationGroupElement` from a `GapElement_Permutation` given that I have given a permutation group element of the same parent. This thus became a method for `PermutationGroupElement` with argument `GapElement_List`. In particular, I have this method now for python lists and for gap list.

As a byproduct, one may call this from the `one` of the parent if only the parent is given but not the element.

See that this later is indeed slower:

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)])
sage: one = P.one()
sage: perm = libgap.eval('[]')
sage: %timeit one._generate_new_GAP(perm)
The slowest run took 138.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 174 ns per loop
sage: %timeit P.one()._generate_new_GAP(perm)
The slowest run took 77.00 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 220 ns per loop
```

I chose the first because it was slightly faster. Also I wanted to keep

```

```
to see the other but slower ways to do this.

```
-            in the two algorithms, and is not even guaranteed to always
-            be the same for one of the two.
```
This now depends on gap behaviour, also I prefer not to guarantee that I will not change the output when changing the implementation. Anyways, if you prefer to remove it, that's fine too.

I get the latter is faster:

```
sage: A = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)])
sage: %timeit libgap.Group(A.gens())
The slowest run took 13.32 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 53.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit libgap(A)
The slowest run took 4.21 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.6 µs per loop
```

Commented out code gets removed quite quickly by other people and looks bad to put slower code. The data is in the history if someone wants to look it up.

If a particular version of GAP is consistent, than no comment is necessary (a number of doctests typically change when GAP upgrades). We have never guaranteed an output order for group iteration, so I don't see any point in mentioning it.

Currently, the slow iteration using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` uses depth first search with generators being the group generators. Which of the following would you prefer:

I would think that bfs would be a more natural ordering, especially for small groups that you actually look at and see how the Cayley graph is propagated. Using also inverses is another question and I don't actually have a preference. Sometimes generating sets for Cayley graphs are expected to also contain inverses, sometimes not.

yes, and even more is true: some doctest pick out some unspecified element

```
         sage: SGA.group()
         Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group
         sage: SGA.an_element()

+        () + (1,2,3,4) + 2*(1,3)(2,4) + 3*(1,4)(2,3)

do stuff with it

```
 
             sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4).algebra(QQ)
             sage: G.retract_plain(G.an_element(), 3)
-            () + 2*(1,2)
+            ()
```
which might be boring for other elements (such as here), or even pick special elements with intended properties from it

```
     sage: D = DihedralGroup(5)
     sage: elements = D.list(); elements
-    [(), (1,5)(2,4), (1,2,3,4,5), (1,4)(2,3), (1,3,5,2,4), (2,5)(3,4),

Dear Christian,

Thanks very much for the cc on the changes to Judson's AATA.  I'll be able to do a diff and even more quickly discern what has changed.  I'm waiting on 8.3 to do a new update for the book, so this may miss that cut-off, but that should not be a crisis by any means.  Thanks everyone for your work keeping this code working well.

I have rebased it to 8.4.beta1 and over #26045. However, let's let this run on some patchbots to see if there is any machine dependency (in addition, if some of the other people here can do so). If there are no doctest failures, then we are safe to assume the SGS iterator is not machine dependent. With that, I would be okay setting a positive review.

I suspect that is just a leftover from the test not being run. I doubt it is machine-dependent, so the fix I just pushed should take care of it.

That is libGAP code on that line (comes from the `libgap.function_factory("""`), so it is not Python3 incompatible.

I think I forgot to run the `--long` when I checked this locally (and so I concluded that it was a spurious patchbot fault). However, I did confirm this locally. It seems like the group is too large to pass to libgap:

```
sage: libgap(aut)  # the group from the test in question
python2: libgap.c:184: libgap_get_input: Assertion `strlen(libGAP_stdin_buffer) < length' failed.
```
It has 1152 generators! However `gap` handles this fine.

So I just reverted the first change on [comment:115](#comment%3A115), and that seems to fix the problem. I can see how that is more safe as I am surprised `libgap` is passing things by strings. Which might account for the fact that `@`stumpc5 and me got different timing results.

If you fix the base to be used, you'd have less variance, but still there could be randomisation involved in choosing the ordering of the base elements.

We should not tweak algorithms in order to make testing easier, we should tweak tests, anyway.

I don't think this is a right fix. Any new version of GAP might mess this up...
How about

```
sage: set(list(P))
{(), (2,3), (1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,3)}
```
or

```
sage: sorted(list(P))
[(), (2,3), (1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,3)]
```

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A183):
> I added a `rel tol` in case there ends up being other slight numerical differences in the future.

The digits after `2.18169499` are not right, for the exact evaluation gives
`2.18169499062...`.

```
sage: (5/12*sqrt(5) + 5/4).n()
2.18169499062491
```
That's why I'd prefer truncation as I suggested.

Okay, that is not quite the right terminology. It still suggests that there is significantly more variation in the doctest than what it really has. However, I changed it because I want this to get in and don't want it cut from the next stable release.

There could be more variation coming from a yet another CPU used. E.g. if you have a better FPU then you might get closer to the correct value, which would again break the doctest if it had too much numerical noise left.
