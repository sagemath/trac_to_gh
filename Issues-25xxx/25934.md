Since the field discriminant is less than `10^6` the string function calls gens_reduced, and that is taking the time.  Specifially the call to self_cache_bnfisprincipal() is.

That's such a special case, I'm not convinced that it's worth it.

Indeed. So I would say that this heuristic bound of the discriminant is not sufficient to predict that the class group is easy to compute.

There is something strange here.  Nothing to do with the representation if ideals really.  For this field, if you construct its pari_bnf, it takes ages to return even with no output:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 - x^5 - 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 3*x - 1)                                                                                 
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                    
CPU times: user 1min 11s, sys: 128 ms, total: 1min 11s
Wall time: 1min 11s
```
but in a fresh Sage session, if I interrupt the second line immediately and then rerun it:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 - x^5 - 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 3*x - 1)                                                                                 
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                
<interrupt after <1s>
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                                                                                                  
CPU times: user 36 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 36 ms
Wall time: 37.2 ms
```

Also, after this, displaying K.ideal(1,1) is instantaneous.  So I think that there *is* a bug in here, though I cannot tell what is happening.

Simplifying further:

```
sage: y = polygen(QQ, 'y')                                                                                                                             
sage: f = pari(y^6 - y^5 - 5*y^4 + 4*y^3 + 6*y^2 - 3*y - 1)                                                                                            
sage: %time f.bnfinit() 
CPU times: user 1min 9s, sys: 144 ms, total: 1min 9s
Wall time: 1min 9s
```
while again, interrupting immediately and reissuing the last line gives the output immediately.

Lastly, 

```
sage: %gp                                                                                                                                              

  --> Switching to PARI/GP interpreter <--

pari: K = bnfinit(y^6 - y^5 - 5*y^4 + 4*y^3 + 6*y^2 - 3*y - 1);                                                                                        

pari: ##
