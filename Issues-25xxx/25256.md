Enhancements to sage's built-in unit distance graphs.

1. Change the embedding of the Moser spindle to be a unit-distance embedding, and add a test to the docstring.

2. Add the Golomb graph, another small unit-distance graph of chromatic number 4.

The changes make these the first and only graphs in smallgraphs.py to have exact algebraic position dicts (using Rational objects and the sqrt function). If inexact floats are preferable for some reason this can be changed and the doctest changed to check that the distance between adjacent vertices is very close to 1 rather than exactly 1.

Keywords: **graphs, graph generators**

Hello and welcome to Sagemath.

I have some comments on your patch:

- `Returns the Golomb graph.` -> `Return the Golomb graph.`

- Instead of putting a lot of examples, you could add a text like: `The Golomb graph is a planar and Hamiltonian graph with 10 vertices and 18 edges. It has chromatic number 4, diameter 3, radius 2 and girth 3. It can be drawn in the plane as a unit distance graph.`

  Then you can keep the test showing that it's a unit distance graph.

- It might be better to refer to the wikipedia page like that:

```
-    For more information, see this
-    `MathWorld article on the Golomb graph <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GolombGraph.html>`_.
+    See :wikipedia:`Golomb_graph` for more information.
```

- For the test for unit distance graph, I think this is equivalent and simpler

```
sage: dist2 = lambda u,v:(u[0]-v[0])**2 + (u[1]-v[1])**2
sage: all(dist2(pos[u], pos[v]) == 1 for u, v in G.edge_iterator(labels=None))
```

You will have to rebase your patch on last develop branch.

I did some corrections directly in your patch to be more efficient. You can push modifications to the new branch as it is in `public`.

What I did:
- use rational field `QQ` instead of defining `ratlit`
- move import of `sqrt` and `QQ` at the top of the file
- remove some trailing white spaces
- some [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) cleaning

If you agree with thoses changes, you can set this ticket to positive review on my behalf.
