```
I often want `number_field_elements_from_algebraics()` to return a morphism that goes back to the same field as the elements that I passed in.

For example:

```
sage: number_field_elements_from_algebraics(QQbar(2))
(Rational Field, 2, Ring morphism:
   From: Rational Field
   To:   Algebraic Real Field
   Defn: 1 |--> 1)
```

Notice that the morphism comes back to `AA`, not `QQbar`.

I've added an option to get the behavior that I want:

```
sage: number_field_elements_from_algebraics(QQbar(2), same_field=True)
(Rational Field, 2, Ring morphism:
   From: Rational Field
   To:   Algebraic Field
   Defn: 1 |--> 1)
```

Perhaps this should be the default, but it broke enough regression tests that I left it as an option.

This is the only troublesome one:

```
sage: a = QQbar((-1)^(1/4)); b = AA(a^3-a); t = b.as_number_field_element()
```

It raises an exception with the new code (if `same_field=True` is the default).

The problem is that without `minimal=True`, the generated number field might be complex, and thus unable to map back to `AA`.

So, if the elements are from `AA`, `same_field=True` might not work without  `minimal=True`, and I wasn't inclined to change that default.
