In 8.3 beta 7:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
sage: PD = da.PartitionDiagrams(3/2)
sage: PD.list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
sage: [[-2,-1],[2,1]] in PD
True
```

The fix is to remove the individual `__contains__` methods, and correct the generic one, and optimize afterwards.  However, to avoid a mess, I'd like to wait for the dependencies.

I do not understand these doctests:

```
 sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: PA = PartitionAlgebra(2, x, R, 'P')
            sage: PA([]) == PA.one()
            True
            sage: D = da.DiagramAlgebra(2, x, R, 'P', da.PartitionDiagrams(2))
            sage: D([]) == D.one()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ValueError: invalid input of []
```

Why is `PA([])` supposed to give the identity, but `D([])` throw an error?  Is it because of `UnitDiagramMixin` magic?

Put differently, the `check` method of `AbstractPartitionDiagram` explicitely allows the empty diagram, irrespective of order.  Should `[] in PartitionDiagrams(2)` return true or false?

Started reviewing:
1. 

```
+            obj = self._element_constructor_(obj)
```
I think here `self(obj)` is the correct way to do as this includes the shortcuts for elements with the "correct" parent.

2.

```
+        if self.order not in ZZ:
+            # check that k and -k are in the same block
+            k = ZZ(self.order + ZZ(1)/ZZ(2))
```
I have no glue when the order is not in ZZ (apperently it can have half values, but is this always the case? (I am a bit scared about this code...)

So, either someone tells me, where this is explained or someone else takes a look (I'd prefer the latter).

Rest looks good AFAICS.

Wow, that was quick - thank you!

OK, I admit I don't know about the first one, so I simply tried and it looks OK.  If I understand correctly, `self(obj)` will invoke `__call__`, which in turn calls `_element_constructor_`, right?  I did not check whether there is a performance penality.

The second one is by design of this class (which is not myself).  For the partition algebra, it makes algebraically a lot of sense to have half-integer order.  Combinatorially, this simply implies that the final elements of the top and the bottom row, by convention k and -k, are in the same block.

By design, all other diagram algebras are currently regarded as sub-algebras of the partition algebra.  This may be up to debate, but is certainly outside the scope of this ticket.

No because there is no patch to provide. What I am saying is that I do not think your proposed change is the way forward with reasoning why. Although I did see one typo above that I have fixed.

It is definitely the way to go because it has better separation-of-concerns (checks are localized to each part), it is faster, and it should not be hard to do. If you want to make it work, then fix it properly.

The `__contains__` method should be fast as a general rule. Moreover, general code is usually more complicated as it has poorer separation-of-conerns. This is why we have subclasses. We also already have implementations that mostly work. I see this proposal as 1 step forward, 2 steps back.

A few questions, comments and a clarification:

1.) I actually did propose to implement efficient methods once the generic check works, and as need arises.  As you know I spent quite a bit of time speeding up the code for diagram algebras, because it was too slow for my computations.  Thus, I think you could trust me that I care about speed and thought about how to achieve it.

Fun fact: removing the "specialised" `TemperleyLiebDiagrams.__contains__` results in a factor 0.8 **speedup** of the following test:

```
sage: r=5; td = da.TemperleyLiebDiagrams(r); l = da.PartitionDiagrams(r).list()
sage: %timeit sum(1 for d in l if d in td)
```
I am guessing that this is because it first checks whether the candidate is in `BrauerDiagrams`, thus duplicating a lot of work.

2.) I do think the general rule is to go for correctness first, and then optimize.  (This is not saying that my patch is perfect, of course.  In particular, I think I should have removed the `__contains__` from `TemperleyLiebDiagrams` and `PlanarDiagrams`, too.)

In the case at hand I think it is particularly important to have a well working generic check, to make it less work to implement new diagram algebras.  In particular, #25637 moves three from `partition_algebra.py` to this module, using the same generic `__contains__` method.

I do not see what "separation-of-concerns" has to do with my approach: I am simply determining containment by trying to construct the diagram.

3.) I understand that you think "it is definitively the way to go", but I do not see why.  I think your argument about speed is invalid, because the current implementation is buggy, and duplication of code is often a source of bugs.

Probably. That is an interesting data point.

I feel that is a bit of a misrepresentation of those `__contains__` as we are deprecating those classes.

You are taking things that should be in separate classes and pulling them to one class. The containment check for being a Brauer diagram should be done by the Brauer diagram parent class after it has been determined that it is a partition diagram by the partition diagram class. Each class tests what it is suppose to be.

> 3.) I understand that you think "it is definitively the way to go", but I do not see why.  I think your argument about speed is invalid, because the current implementation is buggy, and duplication of code is often a source of bugs.


That does not make it invalid. It just means we need to fix a bug. We are only arguing about how to fix the bug. IMO, your fix makes the code less clear, harder to optimize in the future (as any optimization would undo your change), and likely generically makes the code slower (but I have not run timings yet).

There is also very little duplication of code. The only part that is duplicated is the part that converts a non (abstract) partition diagram to an object of the parent. If you are worried about that, you can make that into a function. However, the meat of the issue has no duplication.

I wonder if the only thing that is going wrong is this part:

```
# check that k and -k are in the same block
```

reciprocally.

No.  Those classes (rooks, planar rooks and permutations) are migrated to the better framework in `diagram_algebra.py`, only the old implementations are deprecated.

> You are taking things that should be in separate classes and pulling them to one class. 


No. This is absolutely not what the patch does. I am only removing code.

Besides:

> I believe you also get `None` in `PartitionDiagrams(0)` returning `True` [...]


No.  I agree it is a good idea to check this corner case!

Anyway.  My offer is as follows:

* remove the `__contains__` here
* do #25637, so that all algebras are in this class
* discuss and implement a better `__contains__` machinery - but *after* having migrated the other classes from `partition_algebra.py` to `diagram_algebra.py`.

A final question:

I don't really know.  The logic is (for my brain) scattered over too many places.

> The containment check for being a Brauer diagram should be done by the Brauer diagram parent class after it has been determined that it is a partition diagram by the partition diagram class. Each class tests what it is suppose to be.


However, I think it would make sense to swap the `__contains__` and `check` methods: the meat of the check could be in `__contains__` of the parent classes, and the `check` method could be generic in `AbstractPartitionDiagram`.

The advantage is speed, the cost is that one probably looses some information for the error message.  For example, `TemperleyLieb` is the intersection of `Brauer` and `Planar`.  Currently the user is told whether the diagram has bad blocks, and if all blocks are OK, whether the diagram is planar.  A generic `check` could probably only say "This is not a Temperley-Lieb diagram".

The other way to gain performance and remove duplication of code is probably to remove `AbstractSetPartition`.

This is the sticking point and what I disagree with doing. How about we fix the actual bug?

#25637 is basically independent of this and those old classes are meant to be deprecated. So that is irrelevant to this discussion.

This is not a good strategy. Fix the problem at hand. It sounds like you are suggesting to remove code just to add it back in. If you are not sure and feel it warrants a full design discussion, then let us fix the bug using the current framework, which should be easy, and then have the discussion.

Are you saying you are unable to debug this with the current implementation?

I generally agree with this, but your proposed change actually goes the opposite direction of this.

> The advantage is speed, the cost is that one probably looses some information for the error message.  For example, `TemperleyLieb` is the intersection of `Brauer` and `Planar`.  Currently the user is told whether the diagram has bad blocks, and if all blocks are OK, whether the diagram is planar.  A generic `check` could probably only say "This is not a Temperley-Lieb diagram".


In properly optimized code, there would be no speed advantage to having a generic method. Generic code needs to work generically, and so it cannot take advantage of special structure.

> The other way to gain performance and remove duplication of code is probably to remove `AbstractSetPartition`.


Removing ABCs is usually independent of performance, and it generally involves more code duplication because there is less commonality with related classes.
