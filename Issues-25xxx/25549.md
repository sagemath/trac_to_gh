Mainly to be on the safe side. I have no idea what the C API does with subclasses of `bytes`.

Whenever a real use case for `bytes` subclasses comes up, we can always revisit this.

OK.

Apart from that, the code looks fine to me, all tests pass, and you added a test that shows that the bug is fixed.

I guess I don't mind, but what even is the use case for this:

```
cython('''from sage.cpython.string cimport str_to_bytes''')
```

?

IMO `str_to_bytes()` is just a convenience utility for use within Sage, and not otherwise.  It's very easy to implement similar wrappers for one's own purposes.

This may be. However, Cython currently doesn't provide it.

In fact I did try to use `from sage.cpython.string cimport str_to_bytes` in a third-party package for Sage. So, the reason for this ticket was an actual use case.

True, but I think this demonstrates that there's a case for it.  You can also write such code with normal `if` statements as well, but I think it goes without saying that it's better to compile away such branches if possible.
