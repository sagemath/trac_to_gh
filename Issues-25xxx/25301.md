This function in the `sage.modular.modsym.relation_matrix_pyx` takes a set as input, and gives different results depending on the iteration order of the set (which is arbitrary, and often different on Python 2 vs Python 3).

While this in itself is not at all a bug, but a feature of the algorithm, this has far reaching effect on the results of other computations, resulting in tests that fail on Python 3 since the set ordering is definitely not the same (but the same tests could just as easily fail on Python 2 in principle).

Not sure yet what the best approach is to this.

So the question is : 

should we just change the doctests or try to make them more robust ?

The opinion of some experts in modular symbols and Hecke operators is required..

**PLEASE**, opinion from experts of modular symbols is required on the failing doctests!

Tell us if either

(1) the current change only modifies the bases of modular symbols and is harmless. We just need to change the doctests.

or

(2) at least some of the failing doctests are real failures, with bad and wrong answers

And this fixes all doctests in 14 files in python3.

So I am extremely tempted to give it a positive review...

There's a still a comment saying "should be sorted(rels)" when now it *is* that.

That is just the sort of test I was going to suggest, but 4691 is prime and that is a very special case, so I suggest (as you have the new and old code up and running I think it is easier for you than for me right now) that you also try the following levels:  N with several prime factors (e.g. 2310), larger prime powers, and a combination of the above such as 1680.
