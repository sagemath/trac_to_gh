IIRC I've had this problem for a while but never made a report of it.

It works if I run `SAGE_DEBUG=no make ecl`.

I see, `Dl_info` is not defined unless the `_GNU_SOURCE` macro is defined--this the default on Linux, but on Cygwin it is not defined by default.  This should be fixed upstream, but we can also easily add it in.

Fairly trivial fix.  In this case I deliberately did not bump the package version for a few reasons:

1) The main purpose of doing so would be for testing on buildbots, however there is still not yet an automated Cygwin buildbot (ironically, this issue was hit in the process of trying to test and configure one).

2) It only affects Sage on Cygwin--there is no need to waste buildbot time on other platforms that won't be affected by this change.

3) Even on existing builds on Cygwin it is not necessary to re-build ECL due to this change; this will only fix an issue on systems where ECL could not be built in the first place.

I'm happy to bump it anyways if anyone suggests otherwise, but I believe these are good arguments not to in this case.

I've had a number of private conversations about possibilities for hosting such things.  The problem has consistently been that Cygwin under a virtualized host can be rather slow.  This slowness can be mitigated significantly with appropriate control over the VM host, but with cloud services we frequently don't even have that.  I tried setting up a VM on Azure, for example, and it was still rather slow.\n\nAnyways, we now (or will soon) have a buildbot running on a VM once all these blocker issues are fixed.  In the meantime the best thing is having a dedicated host.  We have had discussions about purchasing a machine with OpenDreamKit funds, but I don't know where that's at right now.",

It may or may not.  I've had a number of private conversations about possibilities for hosting such things.  The problem has consistently been that Cygwin under a virtualized host can be rather slow.  This slowness can be mitigated significantly with appropriate control over the VM host, but with cloud services we frequently don't even have that.  I tried setting up a VM on Azure, for example, and it was still rather slow.

Anyways, we now (or will soon) have a buildbot running on a VM once all these blocker issues are fixed.  In the meantime the best thing is having a dedicated host.  We have had discussions about purchasing a machine with OpenDreamKit funds, but I don't know where that's at right now.

I was not hit with this, but Sage builds on my cygwin just fine with this and it doesn't affect other systems. So I am setting this to a positive review.
