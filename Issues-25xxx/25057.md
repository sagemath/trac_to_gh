IIRC I've had this problem for a while but never made a report of it.

It works if I run `SAGE_DEBUG=no make ecl`.

I see, `Dl_info` is not defined unless the `_GNU_SOURCE` macro is defined--this the default on Linux, but on Cygwin it is not defined by default.  This should be fixed upstream, but we can also easily add it in.

<a id='comment:10'></a>
Fairly trivial fix.  In this case I deliberately did not bump the package version for a few reasons:

1) The main purpose of doing so would be for testing on buildbots, however there is still not yet an automated Cygwin buildbot (ironically, this issue was hit in the process of trying to test and configure one).

2) It only affects Sage on Cygwin--there is no need to waste buildbot time on other platforms that won't be affected by this change.

3) Even on existing builds on Cygwin it is not necessary to re-build ECL due to this change; this will only fix an issue on systems where ECL could not be built in the first place.

I'm happy to bump it anyways if anyone suggests otherwise, but I believe these are good arguments not to in this case.

I was not hit with this, but Sage builds on my cygwin just fine with this and it doesn't affect other systems. So I am setting this to a positive review.
