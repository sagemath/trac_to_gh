Either I'm incredibly "lucky" or #24735 really triggered this for me. Observations until now:

- only happened with the nix package, not sage-the-distribution. But since I only incremented the singular version and added the #24735 patch, it should not be a packaging issue

- doesn't happen if the test is run individually

- doesn't happen if I unroll the loop (manually copying the assert 29 times)

I don't think that it's any of those changes in particular. This is a kind of non-local bug that I've seen in the past. Most likely it has something to do with precise memory (de)allocations: an unrelated change in Sage triggers some garbage collection which subtly changes something which eventually leads to this bug.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A10):
> Looks like only integer arithmetic is involved; Might be a corrupted mpir limb in the pool due to a preceeding interrupt test.


As far as I can see, there is no such test in that file. The doctester tests every file in a separate process, so there can be no interference from interrupt tests in other files.
