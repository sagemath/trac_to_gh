The doctest framework itself should not depend on matplotlib or sympy. This is because some other packages (`p_group_cohomology` for example) use the Sage doctest framework but do not otherwise require those packages.

There is harm if the **Sage doctesting framework** requires two of **Sage's** standard packages to run tests because the Sage doctesting framework is used for non-Sage tests too in #18514.
