The doctest framework itself should not depend on matplotlib or sympy. This is because some other packages (`p_group_cohomology` for example) use the Sage doctest framework but do not otherwise require those packages.

I'd find it very good if one could use the SageMath doctest framework with as few prerequisites as possible. So, if this branch makes it so that sympy and matplotlib are not required to run doctests, I am +1!

There is harm if the **Sage doctesting framework** requires two of **Sage's** standard packages to run tests because the Sage doctesting framework is used for non-Sage tests too in #18514.
