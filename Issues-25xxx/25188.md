If `./configure` detects an existing GCC installed in Sage (`SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=exists`) then it should keep gcc selected among the packages to be installed as part of the distribution.  Otherwise it basically deselects gcc which is the wrong thing to do (with any package).

I don't think anything's really being obscured here.  The old hard-coded makefile didn't expand those variables either so if you suspected something to do with them you've lost nothing.

Right, I didn't think you were doing that.  I'm just explaining that that capability exists (even if it's sometimes not a good idea), and that that's nothing new.

<a id='comment:19'></a>It's resolving the thing I at least thought you were confused about.

Say you want to install gcc in Sage (whether explicitly, or by requirement of configure):

```
$ SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes ./configure
```

then `./configure` correctly outputs:

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0
...
```

Then you install the gcc SPKG (explicitly or otherwise):

```
$ make gcc
```

And in the Makefile you see

```
BUILT_PACKAGES =\
...
gcc \
...
```

and

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

However, if you then re-run `./configure` (without explicitly supplying `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`):

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
...
```

it now says gcc spkg will not be installed (even though it is in fact already installed, and should continue to be installed).  Furthermore this means:

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gcc \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

so the stamp file for the gcc spkg is now `$SAGE_SPKG_INST/.dummy` and not the real stamp file for the actual installed gcc.  This obviously isn't the intended behavior, nor the behavior for any other package.  This bug is just unique to the gcc package because of how its installation state is being managed by the configure script.

<a id='comment:29'></a>This seems like a reasonable change to me. Feel free to set this to positive review from my end. What's the current status here embray?

I think, with this patch, that still would not happen, but I need to make sure.

Either way, I don't think pretending that sage-gcc is not selected is a good way to deal with this.  Better to see if a special case can be made for toolchain dependencies (as in the more recent ticket #25857).
