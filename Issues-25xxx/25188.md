If `./configure` detects an existing GCC installed in Sage (`SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=exists`) then it should keep gcc selected among the packages to be installed as part of the distribution.  Otherwise it basically deselects gcc which is the wrong thing to do (with any package).

I think the problem has more to do with the oddities of how gcc is being handled, especially since #24703.

I was confused because you wrote that "gcc is also installed", but in your Makefile it has `gcc` in `DUMMY_PACKAGES` implying that it was not selected for installation.  Yet all the packages have `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc` as dependencies implying that it was installed at some point.

I think that what #24703 missed is that even if `$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = exists` it needs to be setting `needs_to_install_gcc = yes` (this doesn't actually mean it will reinstall gcc if it isn't necessary to--this just means gcc is selected for possible installation in Sage, pending checking of its prerequisites by make).   Since that isn't happening, the build system gets into a funny state where Sage's gcc *is* installed, but the build system doesn't really think it should be.

I don't think anything's really being obscured here.  The old hard-coded makefile didn't expand those variables either so if you suspected something to do with them you've lost nothing.

<a id='comment:19'></a>
It's resolving the thing I at least thought you were confused about.

Say you want to install gcc in Sage (whether explicitly, or by requirement of configure):

```
$ SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes ./configure
```

then `./configure` correctly outputs:

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0
...
```

Then you install the gcc SPKG (explicitly or otherwise):

```
$ make gcc
```

And in the Makefile you see

```
BUILT_PACKAGES =\
...
gcc \
...
```

and

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

However, if you then re-run `./configure` (without explicitly supplying `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`):

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
...
```

it now says gcc spkg will not be installed (even though it is in fact already installed, and should continue to be installed).  Furthermore this means:

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gcc \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

so the stamp file for the gcc spkg is now `$SAGE_SPKG_INST/.dummy` and not the real stamp file for the actual installed gcc.  This obviously isn't the intended behavior, nor the behavior for any other package.  This bug is just unique to the gcc package because of how its installation state is being managed by the configure script.

It's not that it's recompiling GCC.  It's a reminder that GCC is supposed to be installed in Sage in the first place.  It's really wrong--it means that if you delete `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/gcc-*` then the gcc package won't get rebuilt.  You *do* want that because otherwise the package is for all intents and purposes broken.  I also don't know why you would want to treat gcc differently from any other package in this regard.

The only way I could see this remotely making sense is if proper uninstallation were also implemented.  Otherwise you're effectively saying "gcc is not part of this Sage distribution" even though it is installed.

Because GCC tends to give cyclic build dependencies: GCC depends on MPIR but MPIR depends on GCC.
