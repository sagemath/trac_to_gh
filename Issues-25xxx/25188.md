If `./configure` detects an existing GCC installed in Sage (`SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=exists`) then it should keep gcc selected among the packages to be installed as part of the distribution.  Otherwise it basically deselects gcc which is the wrong thing to do (with any package).

Depends on #25857

I think the problem has more to do with the oddities of how gcc is being handled, especially since #24703.

I was confused because you wrote that "gcc is also installed", but in your Makefile it has `gcc` in `DUMMY_PACKAGES` implying that it was not selected for installation.  Yet all the packages have `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc` as dependencies implying that it was installed at some point.

I think that what #24703 missed is that even if `$SAGE_INSTALL_GCC = exists` it needs to be setting `needs_to_install_gcc = yes` (this doesn't actually mean it will reinstall gcc if it isn't necessary to--this just means gcc is selected for possible installation in Sage, pending checking of its prerequisites by make).   Since that isn't happening, the build system gets into a funny state where Sage's gcc *is* installed, but the build system doesn't really think it should be.

I haven't reviewed the patch, but it would really be useful if `DEBUG_RULES=1` would show *everything* that ends up in the `Makefile`. In particular, the expansions of the `inst_FOO` variables are currently missing.

This is precisely the sort of thing why I opposed #21524: the `Makefile` rules are too obscure to understand what is broken.

Yes, I meant "gcc has been installed at some point in the past". `configure` correctly detects that `gfortran` should not be installed, but it's still being installed anyway.

I don't think anything's really being obscured here.  The old hard-coded makefile didn't expand those variables either so if you suspected something to do with them you've lost nothing.

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
It's resolving the thing I at least thought you were confused about.

Say you want to install gcc in Sage (whether explicitly, or by requirement of configure):

```
$ SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes ./configure
```

then `./configure` correctly outputs:

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0
...
```

Then you install the gcc SPKG (explicitly or otherwise):

```
$ make gcc
```

And in the Makefile you see

```
BUILT_PACKAGES =\
...
gcc \
...
```

and

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

However, if you then re-run `./configure` (without explicitly supplying `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`):

```
checking package versions...
...
    gcc-7.2.0 not installed (configure check)
...
```

it now says gcc spkg will not be installed (even though it is in fact already installed, and should continue to be installed).  Furthermore this means:

```
DUMMY_PACKAGES = \
    curl \
    gcc \
    gfortran \
    git \
```

so the stamp file for the gcc spkg is now `$SAGE_SPKG_INST/.dummy` and not the real stamp file for the actual installed gcc.  This obviously isn't the intended behavior, nor the behavior for any other package.  This bug is just unique to the gcc package because of how its installation state is being managed by the configure script.

I think the affected users would prefer not to recompile gcc if they can avoid it... Though I'll leave it to you two to figure it out. But if there is no resultion real soon (TM) then it won't be in 8.2.

I think, with this patch, that still would not happen, but I need to make sure.

Either way, I don't think pretending that sage-gcc is not selected is a good way to deal with this.  Better to see if a special case can be made for toolchain dependencies (as in the more recent ticket #25857).

I had to make a small change over the previous fix, but I'm pretty confident this works.  I also had to merge in the fix from #25857 in order to be able to be able to test this at all without breaking things too much.

You can install sage-gcc, then packages that gcc depends on like mpir can be reinstalled and updated as much as you want.  This isn't a problem because, in part, all of gcc's dependencies are listed as prerequisite-only.
