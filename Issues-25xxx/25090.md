<a id='comment:18'></a>I am current in Osnabr√ºck with Winfried, and perhaps now would be a good time to refresh this ticket, now that the version 1.12 and other update of Normaliz are already in the box...

There will be a new version of Normaliz released in the next few days, so I would wait until the upstream is updated and then change the ticket. I would do the same with pynormaliz and then go ahead to test it.

Further, with that release, it will make it easier to work with the algebraic polytopes ticket.

<a id='comment:22'></a>I guess now this ticket needs proper review and testing.

It is a really good corner stone for the next steps in #25091 and #25097.

Please install on your platforms and check if it compiles...

There are a few new features along with the new versions.

<a id='comment:31'></a>I could figure out where the segfault occurs and with which input:

```
# Calling PyNormaliz.NmzCone(**{'inhom_equations': [], 'inhom_inequalities': [[0]]})
# ----8<---- Equivalent Normaliz input file ----8<----
amb_space 0
inhom_equations 0

 0
# ----8<-------------------8<-------------------8<----
```

The problem occurs in the `_init_from_Hrepresentation`, where we get the normaliz data: `{'inhom_equations': [], 'inhom_inequalities': [This is the Trac macro *0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0-macro)}`

Somehow normaliz/pynormaliz does not like that?

I believe that dealing with the empty polyhedron at the normaliz level might help here?

Oh, interesting, so probably this would be a good way to initialize the empty polyhedron from the H-representation to pass it to normaliz.

<a id='comment:40'></a>How to properly get the 0-dimensional polytope consisting of the origin only in the 0-dimensional ambient space using the V-representation input consisting of `subspace`, `vertices` and `cone` in normaliz?

```
# Calling PyNormaliz.NmzCone(**{'subspace': [], 'vertices': [[1]], 'cone': []})

Somehow normaliz does not like the above, which is the format that sage currently gives to normaliz to create the `.zero()` element of the parent.

<a id='comment:42'></a>Ok, I do not have the latest "normaliz" on my computer... 

I do not know exactly how to make sage use a different normaliz than the one installed _within_ sage when doing the usual `sage -i normaliz`.

Anyhow, if it is possible to get the empty polyhedron and the 0-dim polytope in the latest version of normaliz. Then these problems should be fixed. Would it be reasonable to have a tiny release of normaliz soon and we could update this branch?
