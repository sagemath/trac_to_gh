The current version of Jmol in Sage is broken on newer JRE versions.  In particular it relies on a `sun.audio` package that [apparently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49051745/how-to-use-sun-audio-with-java-9), has been removed from newer versions of Java.  This causes Jmol to crash at startup.

The newest version fixes that issue, and presumably others.

The doc build process and the doctesting stress jmol quite a bit already.

I'm starting to think perhaps jmol is just not well tested yet against the latest JRE and it's best to downgrade.  Let me see if I can't find a workaround though...

It's more complicated that that. I happen to follow Debian testing quite closely, and I have presently the following JVM/JDK combos available :

```
root@asus16-ec:~# update-java-alternatives --list
java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64       1081       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64       1091       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64
java-gcj-4.8                              /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj-4.8
java-gcj-4.9                              /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj-4.9
```

When I do `update-java-alternatives --set java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64`, I get the reported problem (i. e. no suitable java...). When I switch to `update-java-alternatives --set java-1.9.0-openjdk-amd64` //during the very same Sage session//, java (and jmol) work(s).

Tentative conclusion : Java 9 is broken at least when packaged by Debian...

One more data point in the same direction : the new jmol viewer (installed by the present ticket) works when one uses Java 8 (in my case, `java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64`).

So I'll rephrase my tentative conclusion as "Java 9 is broken WRT our new jmol engine, at least when packaged by Debian".

I have reported this as Debian Bug [894570](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=894570).

It could be interesting to know if some user of the Debian Sage package has hit this bug when following testing.

No other part of my system seems perturbed : LibreOffice , notoriously Java-greedy, works as advertized.

However, starting from my $SAGE_ROOT:

```

charpent@zen-book-flip:/usr/local/sage-P3-2$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Note: SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-P3-2
(sage-sh) charpent@zen-book-flip:sage-P3-2$ /usr/local/sage-P3-2/local/bin/jmol/jmol
Jmol.jar not found in /usr/local/sage-P3-2/local/share/jmol

(sage-sh) charpent@zen-book-flip:sage-P3-2$ exit
exit
Exited Sage subshell.

```

The installation procedure //may// miss something, it seems... I have uploaded the installation log (resulting from `sage -f jmol`).

==> `needs_work`.

Since you used the wrong `spkg-install`, you may have to do the following cleanup before retrying:

```
rm -rf /usr/local/sage-P3-2/local/bin/jmol
```

Replying to [comment:29 charpent]:
> RuntimeError: jmol cannot run, no suitable java version found


You should install the `default-jre` package.

Are you saying that, when `local/bin/jmol` is run from the Sage shell (`sage -sh`), you do not see  the menu ?

Works well on Python 3 as well, so i can not reproduce your issue.

Could you try to bypass the `is_jvm_available()` test and see if you get something ?

Could you tell more about your configuration so that i try to simulate it in a VM ?

Could someone else test the branch as well ?

I do get a `jmol` display behaving as expected.

OK, great, so the issue is very narrowed now.

What is the output of 

```
java -version
```

in a terminal ?

I was thinking on which distro/release/arch, java packages, and options passed to compile Sage, but given the previous answer, i think we do not need that anymore.

Very weird, it should be accepted by the test. Within a Sage command-line, what is the output of:

```
sage: from sage.cpython.string import bytes_to_str
sage: import subprocess, re
sage: version = bytes_to_str(subprocess.check_output(['java', '-version'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT))
sage: version
```

Followed by:

```
sage: java_version = re.search(r'version.*([1][.][789]|"[\d.]+")', version)
sage: bool(java_version)
```

- Fetched the current branch
- Downloaded tarball
- `sage -f jmol`
- Drew successfully a polyhedron with jmol (my original problem)

Works on debian buster with openjdk version "11.0.4" and Sage8.9rc0 with python3.

Any things else I should test?

While we are at it, it is not a hard task to add the 0.X.Y form.

If you know which one, why not.

The benefit of having a (working) version-based test, is that we can also fix some upper bound (the previous version of jmol was not working for java > 8).

Right. In fact I - clueless about java - misunderstood the meaning of the `version` part of the output of
`java -version` - it's not really implementation-dependent, it's apparently indicating 
`java.version` (a "system property" of the JVM). There are two possible formats for `java.version`:

Java 8 or lower: 1.X.A_B, 1.X.Y  (X<9)

Java 9 or higher: X.Y.Z (X>8)

I could not find anywhere any stipulaton of what `java -version` should print, but
it appears very plausable that every implementation puts `java.version` there.

One certainly can write a bit of Java code to test `java.version`, this would be a fool-proof way. So a future ticket can just do this.
