Currently, Sage can only compute the component group invariants and tamagawa numbers for optimal quotients. This is done as a result of William Stein by reducing it to the case of an ambient Jacobian so it should not be hard to implement it. This is the goal of the ticket.

Keywords: **tamagawa, component group, modular jacobian**

Component: **modular forms**
