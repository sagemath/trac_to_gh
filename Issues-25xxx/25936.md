This ticket implements some improvements regarding integrated curves on manifolds, first appearing in #22951.

It adds `scipy.integrate.ode` as an integration solver. The main advantage is that it supports basic event handling, making it possible to detect frontiers of charts. This allows for integration on multiple charts, as shown in [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FlorentinJ/Sage_examples/blob/master/solve_across_charts%20example.ipynb) notebook, which can be particularly useful to avoid singularities, or in manifold which cannot be represented by a single chart, like in [this one](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FlorentinJ/Sage_examples/blob/master/solve_across_charts%20example%202.ipynb) (not commented).


A side effect of this new method is that the time needed for the integration can be reduced (a lot!) by using objects created with `fast_callable` instead of symbolic expressions. This is used in [this](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FlorentinJ/Sage_examples/blob/master/kerr_geodesic_minimal.ipynb) notebook to compute the shape of a geodesic in a Kerr spacetime. Speed test shows a x700 speedup compared to the default integration method "rk4_maxima".

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
Some little things:

- You have `$` in docstrings which should be <code>\`</code>.
- Sometimes it is better to break PEP8 80 char/line, e.g.:

  ```
  -        for ichart in set(initial_pt._coordinates.keys()).\
  -            intersection(charts):
  +        for ichart in set(initial_pt._coordinates.keys()).intersection(charts):
  ```
- This is confusing to read and needs more whitespace padding on the subsequent lines:

  ```
                res += self.plot_integrated(chart=chart,
             ambient_coords=ambient_coords, mapping=mapping, prange=prange,
             interpolation_key=interpolation_key+"_chart_"+str(i),
             include_end_point=include_end_point,
             end_point_offset=end_point_offset, verbose=verbose, color=color[i],
             style=style, label_axes=False, display_tangent=display_tangent,
             color_tangent=color_tangent, across_charts=False,
             plot_points=nb_pts, **kwds)
  ```
- Please remove a lot (all) of these blanklines:

  ```diff
  +            sphinx_plot(fig)
  +
  +
  +
  +
  +        """
  ```
- PEP8:

  ```diff
       def solve_across_charts(self, charts=None, step=None, solution_key=None,
  -              parameters_values=None, verbose=False):
  +                            parameters_values=None, verbose=False):
  ```
- `euclidean` -> `Euclidean`.
- `Let's also Add restrictions` -> `Let us also add restrictions`.
- You're not always consistent with your periods/full-stops at the end of verbose messages.

Otherwise I think I am good with the current branch as it seems to work as claimed. Eric, any other comments?
