This fixes several doctests, and a few APIs that involved returning dict iterators from `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()`, or `dict.items()`.  All existing code assumes that these methods return `lists` containing copies of data from the dict, whereas on Python 3 they return live views into the dict, which makes for some rather different behavior (and in some cases different doctest output).

This probably isn't exhaustive, but is the majority of such bugs I could find in a recent run of the test suite on Python 3.

At least using Python2 it is faster to do `list(D.items())`

```
sage: import six
sage: D = {i:i for i in range(10)}
sage: %timeit list(six.iteritems(D))
The slowest run took 88.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(D.items())
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 µs per loop
sage: D = {i:i for i in range(100)}
sage: %timeit list(six.iteritems(D))
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.27 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(D.items())
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.65 µs per loop
```
Granted, it is not necessarily memory efficient, but I think speed in `functor.pyx` is more important. Same comment can be applied for the other similar changes, including `values()`.

Why do you still use `keys()` in `generic_graph.py`?

In `matrix_generic_sparse.pyx`, I don't think you need the `list`:

```
for key in list(entries):
```
Similar for `reset.pyx`, `conway_polynomials.py`, and `polydict.pyx`. Likewise, I don't understand the need for the change in `decorators.py`.

No specific reason--I guess i wasn't sure if the return value there was actually a dict or not, but it's harmless either way.  In this case I think having the `.keys()` is almost better from a documentation perspective.

You do--in all those cases the dict being looped over is modified in the loops so you must make a list first.
