Only for those matrix groups which are inherited from ParentLibGAP a `subgroup` method is available. But for other matrix groups such as classical groups over rings other than finite fields or ZZ this makes sense as well.

Example:

```
sage: G = GL(2,QQ)
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [[3, 0],[~5,1]])
sage: S = G.subgroup([m])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'LinearMatrixGroup_generic_with_category' object has no attribute 'subgroup'

I add the `subgroup` method to the MatrixGroup_base class, but I avoid overwriting the code from ParentLibGAP. In analogy to the permutation groups I also modify the `__repr__` method such that for a subgroup the ambient group is referred. But for instances of ParentLibGAP this would change existing behavior and many doc-strings. Therefore, I exclude this case, even though I would prefer a corrected representation string in that cases, as well.

With respect to the `ambient` method I don't distinguish the case ParentLibGAP, since this a just a few lines of identical code. Maybe, this better should be moved to the categorial framework.

Sorry for letting this ticket drop off my radar. Some comments:

- It is not good practice to have a bare `except:`. Could you give what error(s) you expect it to raise?
- Error messages should start with lower case letters (following a Python convention).
- `SubGroup` -> `subgroup` for PEP8.
- `if ambient_group == None:` -> `if ambient_group is None:`.
- Is the `if hasattr(self, '_ambient'):` test really necessary?
- In general, is that entire block even necessary? I feel like there shouldn't be a need to not extend this output. Or is there a reason I am not seeing?

Sorry! I should read the PEP8 more often, since much of it is contrary to what I am used to. You will find such things in #27302, as well. Please wait with that ticket until I have fixed them. But there are conventions in PEP8, the purpose of which I really don't understand. For example that about blanklines. IMO that reduces readability of the code. If you kwow a reason, please let me know. That would make it more easier to follow this convention.

I inserted the block, since I was not sure if I should change the previous behaviour that much. Removing that block will change the representation string of subgroups of finite groups, as well. Of course, it will be improved:

If you agree I will remove the block and fix all that doctests. But, will this be o.K. for external code (packages,..), as well?

No problem. I think it is fine to wait for a review before making such changes anyways.

They are guidelines, so no need to follow them exactly. Use your judgement to what you think makes the code the most readable (including consistency with other code in Sage).

I think it is good for those tests to change as it gives more information about the groups in question and are otherwise trivial changes. So +1 to the change in behavior.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

I had a thought/question. I think we should consider putting the generators of the subgroup first then the ambient group after it in the repr. Maybe something like

```
Subgroup with <n> generators (
<generators>
) of <ambient_group>
```
That way the most pertinent information is first and it is a little easier to parse. What do you think?

Also, some little details more:

```
        TESTS:

            sage: TestSuite(G).run()
            sage: TestSuite(S).run()
```
should be `TESTS::`

What type of error are you expecting here:

```
            try:
                return ParentLibGAP.subgroup(self, generators)
            except:
                pass
```
It is better to be explicit about what errors you want to handle.

`raise ValueError("Generator %s is not in the group"%(g))` to lowercase `generator` (this is a Python convention that we try to follow).

Sorry again, I was sure to have those things fixed, but unfortunately I've lost them since my nice mint coloured `Acer One Happy` was damaged last week (the display crashed because of a full brake application in the subway). I think I lost these changes when migrating to the new computer.

One last little thing: could you change the doctests in the `tests/books/judson-abstract-algebra/*` to be close to how they were previously? This way we fit (close to) the 80 char/line. For example

```
Subgroup generated by
[(2,18)(3,17)(4,16)(5,15)(6,14)(7,13)(8,12)(9,11),
 (1,10)(2,11)(3,12)(4,13)(5,14)(6,15)(7,16)(8,17)(9,18)]
of (Dihedral group of order 36 as a permutation group)
```
Once all of those are changed, you can set this to a positive review.

Rob, I am cc-ing you since you were the one who originally added these book tests.
