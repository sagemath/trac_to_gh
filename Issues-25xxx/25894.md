Only for those matrix groups which are inherited from ParentLibGAP a `subgroup` method is available. But for other matrix groups such as classical groups over rings other than finite fields or ZZ this makes sense as well.

Example:

```
sage: G = GL(2,QQ)
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [[3, 0],[~5,1]])
sage: S = G.subgroup([m])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'LinearMatrixGroup_generic_with_category' object has no attribute 'subgroup'
```

I add the `subgroup` method to the MatrixGroup_base class, but I avoid overwriting the code from ParentLibGAP. In analogy to the permutation groups I also modify the `__repr__` method such that for a subgroup the ambient group is referred. But for instances of ParentLibGAP this would change existing behavior and many doc-strings. Therefore, I exclude this case, even though I would prefer a corrected representation string in that cases, as well.

With respect to the `ambient` method I don't distinguish the case ParentLibGAP, since this a just a few lines of identical code. Maybe, this better should be moved to the categorial framework.

Sorry for letting this ticket drop off my radar. Some comments:

- It is not good practice to have a bare `except:`. Could you give what error(s) you expect it to raise?
- Error messages should start with lower case letters (following a Python convention).
- `SubGroup` -> `subgroup` for PEP8.
- `if ambient_group == None:` -> `if ambient_group is None:`.
- Is the `if hasattr(self, '_ambient'):` test really necessary?
- In general, is that entire block even necessary? I feel like there shouldn't be a need to not extend this output. Or is there a reason I am not seeing?

Sorry! I should read the PEP8 more often, since much of it is contrary to what I am used to. You will find such things in #27302, as well. Please wait with that ticket until I have fixed them. But there are conventions in PEP8, the purpose of which I really don't understand. For example that about blanklines. IMO that reduces readability of the code. If you kwow a reason, please let me know. That would make it more easier to follow this convention.

I inserted the block, since I was not sure if I should change the previous behaviour that much. Removing that block will change the representation string of subgroups of finite groups, as well. Of course, it will be improved:

They are guidelines, so no need to follow them exactly. Use your judgement to what you think makes the code the most readable (including consistency with other code in Sage).

I think it is good for those tests to change as it gives more information about the groups in question and are otherwise trivial changes. So +1 to the change in behavior.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

I had a thought/question. I think we should consider putting the generators of the subgroup first then the ambient group after it in the repr. Maybe something like

```
Subgroup with <n> generators (
<generators>
) of <ambient_group>
```
That way the most pertinent information is first and it is a little easier to parse. What do you think?

Also, some little details more:

```
        TESTS:

            sage: TestSuite(G).run()
            sage: TestSuite(S).run()
```
should be `TESTS::`

What type of error are you expecting here:

```
            try:
                return ParentLibGAP.subgroup(self, generators)
            except:
                pass
```
It is better to be explicit about what errors you want to handle.

`raise ValueError("Generator %s is not in the group"%(g))` to lowercase `generator` (this is a Python convention that we try to follow).

Sorry again, I was sure to have those things fixed, but unfortunately I've lost them since my nice mint coloured `Acer One Happy` was damaged last week (the display crashed because of a full brake application in the subway). I think I lost these changes when migrating to the new computer.

One last little thing: could you change the doctests in the `tests/books/judson-abstract-algebra/*` to be close to how they were previously? This way we fit (close to) the 80 char/line. For example

```
Subgroup generated by
[(2,18)(3,17)(4,16)(5,15)(6,14)(7,13)(8,12)(9,11),
 (1,10)(2,11)(3,12)(4,13)(5,14)(6,15)(7,16)(8,17)(9,18)]
of (Dihedral group of order 36 as a permutation group)
```
Once all of those are changed, you can set this to a positive review.

Rob, I am cc-ing you since you were the one who originally added these book tests.
