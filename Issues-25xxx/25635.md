note that `clear_denominators` assumes that its input is monic

and also the output are in reversed order.

timing comparison with th branch here:

```
sage: %timeit make_monic(x^2 + x/2 + 1/4)

But i=0 is for the leading coefficient, no ?

If I run in my mind the code when i=0, I got den=1, and nothing happens..

EDIT: I mean, not in the final creation of the polynomial, but in the main loop.

And maybe the main loop should use range(1,n+1) in fact ?

No, the constant coefficient, the coefficient of degree 0.
