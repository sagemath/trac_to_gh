note that `clear_denominators` assumes that its input is monic

and also the output are in reversed order.

timing comparison with th branch here:

```
sage: %timeit make_monic(x^2 + x/2 + 1/4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 96.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit clear_denominators(x^2 + x/2 + 1/4)
10000 loops, best of 3: 109 µs per loop
sage: make_monic(3*x^3 + 14*x^2 - 7*x + 5)

sage: %timeit make_monic((3*x^3 + 14*x^2 - 7*x + 5)/3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 112 µs per loop
sage: %timeit clear_denominators((3*x^3 + 14*x^2 - 7*x + 5)/3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 155 µs per loop

It is certainly slower when the denominators are large: computing the radical of N means factoring N.

What do you mean? Surely we need to look at the constant coefficient too (image the polynomial is `x + 1/2`).

But i=0 is for the leading coefficient, no ?

If I run in my mind the code when i=0, I got den=1, and nothing happens..

EDIT: I mean, not in the final creation of the polynomial, but in the main loop.

And maybe the main loop should use range(1,n+1) in fact ?

No, the constant coefficient, the coefficient of degree 0.
