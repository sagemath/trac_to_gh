It is certainly slower when the denominators are large: computing the radical of N means factoring N.

But i=0 is for the leading coefficient, no ?

If I run in my mind the code when i=0, I got den=1, and nothing happens..

EDIT: I mean, not in the final creation of the polynomial, but in the main loop.

And maybe the main loop should use range(1,n+1) in fact ?
