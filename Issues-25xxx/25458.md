This is one possibility. Maybe there is a another possibility that would fix the default display format without using the radical display format.

To my knowledge (I reviewed #25210), the default behavior was not affected by #25210. Moreover, on 8.0 and on [sagecell](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?q=mlfmio) currently running 8.2, I am able to reproduce the inconsistency. Therefore, it seems on the contrary that the bug was present *before* #25210:

So do you have any idea to fix the print inconsistency?

Making

```
sage: AA.options.display_format = 'radical'
```
the default is a solution, but maybe it should be discussed on sage-devel first?

The elements print differently depending on how they are represented internally (see `AlgebraicNumber_base._repr_`).

1. This element is represented exactly as an element of `QuadraticField(-1)`:

  ```
  sage: QQbar(1 + I)
  I + 1
   ```

2. This element is represented implicitly as a root of a polynomial, so the `CIF` approximation is used for printing:

  ```
  sage: QQbar(2*I)^(1/2)
  1 + 1*I
   ```

3. If the display format is `radical`, the representation as a radical symbolic expression in `SR` is printed instead:

  ```
  sage: (QQbar(2*I)^(1/2)).radical_expression()
  I + 1
   ```
   (This is rather inefficient in general, so should not become the default.)

It is difficult to unify these three cases. It would not be too hard to change the order of real and imaginary part in (1) to appear the same as (2), but then (3) would look different. The radical expressions in `SR` in (3) are not in general written in terms of real and imaginary part, so this cannot easily be changed to look like (2); for example:

```
sage: QQbar(sqrt(2) + I).radical_expression()
sqrt(2*I*sqrt(2) + 1)
```

On the other hand, making (2) look the same as (1) is also not trivial, as it would require special cases if the imaginary part is exactly 1 or -1, and even then, there are more differences between the representations, for example:

```
sage: QQbar(1 + I) * 2^60
1152921504606846976*I + 1152921504606846976
sage: QQbar(2*I)^(1/2) * 2^60
1.1529215046068470?e18 + 1.1529215046068470?e18*I
```
