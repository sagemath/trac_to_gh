I know this is close to bikeshedding, but I think a slightly more descriptive name would be more appropriate, such as `get_coeff` or `get_coeff_c`, would be better in the long-term for code readability.

Have you also run some timings?

I will also push some further changes that are micro-optimizations (mostly avoiding extra calls to `degree()` by using `get_unsafe()` because we have already checked the degree is non-negative).

Fine with me.

No micro-benchmarks, but this change seems to speed up the “real-world” code I was profiling by ~3%.

I chose `get_coeff_c` to be more explicit that it is a C-level method and so that there would be less chances of accidental conflicts with subclasses.

All of the other changes I did should be micro-optimizations as they avoid checks, multiple calls to other functions (e.g., `degree()`), have more direct paths. I didn't do every possible place because I felt the code clarity outweighed a (very) micro speed gain. Unfortunately there were a few places where having the field with 1 element made it so we had to have different cases (the unit code in particular).

Marc, could you run your "real-world" example again against the code on your branch to see if you notice any differences?
