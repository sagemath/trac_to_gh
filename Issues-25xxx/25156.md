Keywords: latex, multivariate power series, beginner, gsoc2018

Multivariate power series ring elements don't use latex formatting for infinite precision objects.

Currently:

```
$ sage -v; sage -q
SageMath version 8.1, Release Date: 2017-12-07
sage: R.<x, y> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
sage: latex(1 + y^10)
1 + y^10
```

Notice the lack of braces around the number 10. One would expect:

```
sage: latex(1 + y^10)
1 + y^{10}
```

I'm just starting to use Trac, and I'm not sure if my github-linked account is setup right.

I think I just pushed a git patch to fix this defect, but I expected to see some kind of notification here and haven't.

I got an error message during the push "remote: error: hook declined to update"

If you don't have the patch, please let me know.

When you do a reviewer patch, someone else needs to review your patch.

In this case, a blank line is missing in the formatting of the doctest,
and the wording could be improved.

Instead of

```
        See :trac:`25156`::
            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```
we should have

```
        Check that :trac:`25156` is fixed::

            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```
(note the blank line after `::` and before the start of the doctest block).
