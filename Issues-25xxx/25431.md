The patchbots time out with some lattice precision tests https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-20-generic/petitbonum/2018-05-11%2012:03:31?short. I have also seen the same issues with [GitLab](GitLab) CI tests.

The test suite takes too much time, more precisely `_test_matrix_smith`.

```
sage: R = QpLC(7, label='init')
sage: %time TestSuite(R).run(skip='_test_teichmuller')
Wall time: 2min 59s
sage: %time R._test_matrix_smith()
Wall time: 2min 56s
```
