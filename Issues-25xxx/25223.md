With reference to #25123 ticket, this ticket is created.

I have changed the location of the simple_bfs function, make all command is successfully executed, please let me know if any modifications are needed.

Instead of `uint32_t n, uint32_t ** p_vertices`, could you try to pass `short_digraph g, ` instead. 
Then, inside the method, you can add shortcuts to `n` and `p_vertices`.

It's not a trivial change, since you will certainly have to report it inside `distances_all_pairs.pyx`, but in the end it will be a better code, and consistent with other methods. Thanks.

Sure I will write a comment in distances_all_pairs.pyx code that `Simple_BFS` is shifted.

I have my final exam on 26th April after that I will be more active. \\
Update you as soon as possible.

I have updated the `Simple_BFS`, now it will take `short_digraph g` instead of `n` and `p_vertices` but it's leading to change the definitions of \\ 
1. `c_eccentricity_bounding` \\ 
2. `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` \\
3. `diameter_iFUB` \\ 

In which `c_eccentricity_bounding` create `short_digraph g` of `G` so no problem with it but `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` functions take input in terms of `n` and `p_vertices`.

So what do you suggest me to do? go ahead and do necessary changes(may `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` will have future dependencies)?

Completed necessary changes and able to generate executable file i.e `sage`.
Comments are updated only in `Simple_BFS` function. \\
`diameter_lower_bound_multi_sweep` defination is also changed.

Let me know anymore changes required and is comment `g (short_digraph) -- The input graph.` is enough? if yes than shall I update same for remaining functions?

Apparently we should not declare inline method inside a .pxd file.

So could you remove `inline` in .pxd and may be .pyx file as well.

More precisely, it makes no sense to *declare* an inline function. You have two choices for using inline

- *define* it in a pxd, so that they are available from other Cython modules with standard cimport
- *define* it in a pyx, in which case it is only internal to the file

Both situations are in use in Sage.

Thank you for the clarification.

So here we should just remove inline in .pxd and .pyx for this method.
