Instead of `uint32_t n, uint32_t ** p_vertices`, could you try to pass `short_digraph g, ` instead. 
Then, inside the method, you can add shortcuts to `n` and `p_vertices`.

It's not a trivial change, since you will certainly have to report it inside `distances_all_pairs.pyx`, but in the end it will be a better code, and consistent with other methods. Thanks.

Sure I will write a comment in distances_all_pairs.pyx code that `Simple_BFS` is shifted.

I have my final exam on 26th April after that I will be more active. \\
Update you as soon as possible.

I have updated the `Simple_BFS`, now it will take `short_digraph g` instead of `n` and `p_vertices` but it's leading to change the definitions of \\ 
1. `c_eccentricity_bounding` \\ 
2. `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` \\
3. `diameter_iFUB` \\ 

In which `c_eccentricity_bounding` create `short_digraph g` of `G` so no problem with it but `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` functions take input in terms of `n` and `p_vertices`.

So what do you suggest me to do? go ahead and do necessary changes(may `diameter_lower_bound_2sweep` and `diameter_iFUB` will have future dependencies)?

Completed necessary changes and able to generate executable file i.e `sage`.
Comments are updated only in `Simple_BFS` function. \\
`diameter_lower_bound_multi_sweep` defination is also changed.

Let me know anymore changes required and is comment `g (short_digraph) -- The input graph.` is enough? if yes than shall I update same for remaining functions?

Shall I add @dimpase for review? \\

Yes, you must 1) rebase it on top of this ticket, 2) perform necessary changes, 3) don't forget to add the dependency in the ticket description.

More precisely, it makes no sense to *declare* an inline function. You have two choices for using inline

- *define* it in a pxd, so that they are available from other Cython modules with standard cimport
- *define* it in a pyx, in which case it is only internal to the file

Both situations are in use in Sage.
