NumberField previously evaluated integral powers in the NumberField, and evaluated all fractional powers in the symbolic ring.

This patch makes NumberField attempt to evaluate the fractional power within the field, and only falls back on the symbolic ring if this fails.

There's a few interesting changes in the test suite.

Old code:

```
sage: QQbar((2*I)^(1/2))
1 + 1*I
sage: (2*I)^(1/2)
sqrt(2*I)
sage: I^(2/3)
I^(2/3)
```

New code:

```
sage: QQbar((2*I)^(1/2))
I + 1
sage: (2*I)^(1/2)
I + 1
sage: I^(2/3)
-1
```

The first change is just cosmetic.  The second makes good sense, as Sage is now evaluating an expression it didn't before.  The third change is more troubling.

The explanation lies in the definition of I:

```
sage: I.parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: I.pyobject().parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
```

In this number field, there is a single cube root of `I` (`-I`).  Squaring `-I` gives us `-1`, so `I^(2/3)=-1`.

My opinion is that the new behavior of NumberField is correct and preferred, but perhaps `I` should be defined in QQbar, not in a NumberField.

I think this is **very** unfortunate. In Sage, QQ[i] automatically comes with a complex embedding, for which i<sup>2/3</sup> (= exp(iπ/3)) is perfectly well defined. It is really confusing to have a basic operator like `^` (whose evaluation normally uses the coercion framework) that is incompatible with the embedding.

See #30783.
