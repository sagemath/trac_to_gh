I am little out of my depth mathematically here, but it seems to me that the `hl_creation_operator` method for symmetric function elements does the wrong thing when passing in a tuple with the last entry negative. According to the paper referenced in the documentation, [SZ2001], Remark 2 (4), when given a tuple `(\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_k)` with `\nu_k < 0`, one should get `H_\nu^q 1 = 0`. However, this is not the case.

```python
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).s()
sage: elm = s.one()
sage: elm.hl_creation_operator([-100])
-100*s[]
sage: elm.hl_creation_operator([2,1,-100])
(-100*t^2+t+2)*s[]
```

I find this behavior totally bizarre, but it happens because:

```python
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t']).s()
sage: s([-100])
-100*s[]
sage: s([2,1,-100])
(-100*t^2+t+2)*s[]
```

which is also, in my opinion, a very odd choice, but maybe justified somewhere? However, I cannot find this behavior documented anywhere in the symmetric function documentation. I would write some extra documentation myself, but I do not know where this behavior comes from. Any ideas? Thank you!

So the behavior here:

In other words, this takes the same code path as `s(2)`.

From the doc, it is supposing `nu` is a partition, so technically this is bad input from my perspective. However, I will let Mike comment on what the implementation assumes.

There is a formula which can be used in this case to compute the operator when it has negative parts, but it isn't implemented.  I think that Travis has correctly identified what is happening for this particular output.

What is implemented here is equation (12) from [SZ2001] (arXiv version equation numbers) which has as a hypothesis that all entries are non-negative.  But the actual definition of the operator does work for `{\mathbb Z}^k`.  We could (a) raise an error if `nu` is not a partition (b) document what happens if `nu` is not a partition (c) implement the operator for `nu` when it is not a partition.

My two cents:

Having `s([2, 1])` return `s[2, 1]` and `s([1, 2])` return `(2*t+1)*s[]` is inconsistent behavior and can lead to a lot of confusion.

Since `[1, 2] != QQ['t']([1, 2])`, I think it is too much of a stretch to have `s([1, 2]) == s(QQ['t']([1, 2]))`.  A user should need to explicitly cast to the base ring before casting to `s`.

All things considered, I think the desired behavior for `s([1, 2])` at the moment is (a).  Sage should simply raise an error complaining that it doesn't know how to convert it's input into something reasonable.

Very strong -1. This is completely unnatural unless you do not want conversions to the base ring, fraught with corner cases, impossible to maintain. Also -1 on putting a warning for basically the same reasons.

For instance, what if you are doing Macdonald q,t computations, but have a HL in t. Then this is no longer automatic to construct scalars in the HL basis without an explicit base ring conversion. (You need to convert from `QQ[q,t]` to `QQ[t]`; you cannot coerce.) Most likely this will break a lot of code in the wild.

You should not be constructing scalars by using lists, but it is not the job of the code to police all bad user input (garbage-in, garbage-out), especially when such checks require complicated checks and hacks.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

If there is intention to eventually implement (c), then I don't see why we don't do it.  Its only a change of a few lines.  Here is an implementation of `hl_creation_operator` for all sequences of integers rather than just partitions.

The problem is that it might slow down the calculation a bit because it can't take advantage of Proposition 5 from [SZ2001].  I don't know if it is significant enough to worry about, but we could add an `if nu in Partitions():` then calculate with Proposition 5, `else:` use this more general but slightly slower formula.

For the case of `basis(list_of_integers)` I added a line which raises a `NotImplementedError` when that list is not a partition.

Should I just remove those lines and force the user to check `basis(list_of_integers)` or did you mean that I should change the `else:` line to handle that check?

I think that it was not a good idea to have it do calculations in `QQ['t']` and then have it map into the base ring.  Any time that there is not a map from `QQ['t']` to the base ring or if `QQ['t']` doesn't commute with some of the operations in the symmetric functions, you will get incorrect answers.  Former behavior:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(ZZ['t'].fraction_field()).inject_shorthands(verbose=False)
sage: s[2].hl_creation_operator([3])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: only know how to compute plethysms between symmetric functions or tensors of symmetric functions
```
New behavior is that if `t` is not in the base ring than it raises an error and says `TypeError: unable to convert 't' to a ***` and (for example, it is mostly faster to compute in `ZZ['t'].fraction_field()` than `QQ['t'].fraction_field()`):

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(ZZ['t'].fraction_field()).inject_shorthands(verbose=False)
sage: s[2].hl_creation_operator([3])
s[3, 2] + t*s[4, 1] + t^2*s[5]
```

I know you didn't write the test, but if you could break the one very long doctest output for `s([3,2]).hl_creation_operator([2,1,1])`, I would appreciate it.
