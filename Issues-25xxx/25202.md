With #25139 it becomes possible to fully uninstall all files associated with a package, which is done before upgrading that package to a new version.

This would just as easily allow creating a *backup* of the package by moving its files to a temporary location rather than deleting them.  If the package upgrade fails, the old version could then be restored.

One could even imagine keeping backups that can be restored even after a seemingly successful upgrade (e.g. the upgrade succeeds building, but causes runtime regressions).  One could easily get carried away with something like this though and end up re-implementing [hashdist](https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist) (which honestly wouldn't be such a bad thing to have built into Sage...).

But to keep things focused I think this ticket should just consider rollback on build failures to start with.

Depends on #25139

Just FYI in case you didn't know: our release manager is one of the main contributors to hashdist. The project looks pretty dead though: the last commit on github was 2 years ago.
