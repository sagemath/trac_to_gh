http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html says "Anybody (e.g. you) can do this job for somebody else’s ticket."

But I understand if you want to wait for a more established dev to take a look at this.

Btw., it would be great if you could add your real name to trac.sagemath.org.
