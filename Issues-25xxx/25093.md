Looks good to me, thanks for doing this and all the other tickets! I am not a Sage dev though so not sure I can officially "pass" the review. However, I will for sure add it to the Debian package when I next touch that.

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html says "Anybody (e.g. you) can do this job for somebody elseâs ticket."

But I understand if you want to wait for a more established dev to take a look at this.

Btw., it would be great if you could add your real name to trac.sagemath.org.

You can. But the author should set the ticket to needs_review first.
