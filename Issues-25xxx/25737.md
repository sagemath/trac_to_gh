We change the base class of `ParentWithGens` to `Parent` and do some optimizations. Also makes it now use `element_class` and makes the classes work with subclassing:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial_ring import LaurentPolynomialRing_univariate
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial import LaurentPolynomial_univariate
sage: class Foo(LaurentPolynomialRing_univariate):
....:     class Element(LaurentPolynomial_univariate):
....:         pass
sage: F = Foo(QQ['x'])
sage: type(F(2))
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate'>
```
