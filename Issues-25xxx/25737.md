We change the base class of `ParentWithGens` to `Parent` and do some optimizations. Also makes it now use `element_class` and makes the classes work with subclassing:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial_ring import LaurentPolynomialRing_univariate
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial import LaurentPolynomial_univariate
sage: class Foo(LaurentPolynomialRing_univariate):
....:     class Element(LaurentPolynomial_univariate):
....:         pass
sage: F = Foo(QQ['x'])
sage: type(F(2))
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.laurent_polynomial.LaurentPolynomial_univariate'>
```

With my current new branch:

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p = (1 + x)^20
sage: q = (x^-1 + 1 + x)^10
sage: %timeit p * q
The slowest run took 20.04 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.84 µs per loop
```
versus old

```
sage: %timeit p * q
The slowest run took 18.42 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.72 µs per loop
```
