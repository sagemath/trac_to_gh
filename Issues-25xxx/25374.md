I am not sure i understand the rationale in favor of such a move:

- installing `pycryptosat` from `pypi` still requires that we ship `cryptominisat` binaries, so we just add one dependency without removing work on our side (worse, i guess we will have to ensure that the `pycryptosat` shipped by the author in the tarball is *not* installed)

- relying on `pypi` + `pierrev` (the anonymous maintainer of `pycryptosat` in `pypi`) adds 2 intermediates, for which the web of trust is not very clear to me

- if `pycryptosat` shipped by `pypi` stops being updated, then we are locked to update `cryptominisat`

Or do you mean that we should make 2 spkg with different names (`cryptominisat` and `pycryptosat`) with the same upstream tarball, one with `sdh_make` and one with `sdh_pip_install` ?

OK. It seems nontrivial since the `python/README.rst` in the tarball states:

```
The pycryptosat python package compiles while compiling CryptoMiniSat. It
cannotbe compiled on its own, it must be compiled at the same time as
CryptoMiniSat.
```

So, perhaps the way is to keep a single spkg, compile the whole, and then install the various stuff according to the respective variables SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_VENV ?

That wouldn't work so well because of the way how we keep installation records for packages.

I think we should try to split it into two packages and just build, but not install, the library a second time.

I suspect a variable is empty when it shouldn't. It may just be a matter of an extra option, but it could be a windows special.

This is where cmake says it fails

```
string(REPLACE "\n" " " PY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG ${PY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG})

If shared linking doesn't make sense on cygwin, it is not looking good.

<a id='comment:79'></a>Thanks. I always forgot how those two files are usually useless. I don't think we can easily build the python interface on cygwin. Mostly because to build the python module it wants dynamic flags - on linux for example

```
-- Found python interpreter, libs and header files
-- Building python interface
-- Python CFLAGS:  '-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG'
-- Python LDFLAGS: '-ldl  -lm'
-- Python LINKFORSHARED flags: '-Xlinker -export-dynamic'
-- Python module installation prefix: --prefix=/usr
```
If we can hand feed an appropriate `-DPY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG=...` to cmake on cygwin, we may be able to get something. The other option is to turn off python support on the platform :(

Anyone wanting to test flags can do so by running

```
EXTRA_OPTS="-DPY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG='$my_flags'" ./sage -i cryptominisat
```
courtesy of the cmake configure line in `spkg-install.in`

I ran this and it also did not work for me. Maybe the key bit in the log is this:

```
[cryptominisat-5.8.0] -- Python CFLAGS:  '-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall'

Hi, this is upstream talking :) Yep, that is a big mess. Sorry. So, I fixed it up, and it's waaaaay more modern now. Also, there is a Python package, with pip install working etc:

https://pypi.org/project/pycryptosat/

Auto-builds the binary package using [GitHub](GitHub) actions so that's sweet. Let me know how it could be changed to be better. However, I think it should be a lot closer to "good" than the previous setup.
