With this branch, `make cryptominisat` and `sage -i cryptominisat` succeed.

They used to fail with Sage 9.x for the previous version of the package.

Tested on Debian 10 buster and macOS 10.14.6 Mojave. Cygwin testing needed.

New doctest failure (both on Debian and macOS):

```bash

Currently we build cryptominisat including its Python bindings (`pycryptosat`).
This is slightly problematic for the plan to separate non-Python packages (`SAGE_LOCAL`) from Python packages (`SAGE_VENV`), see #29013 (and #30534 for `pynac`).

But there is also https://pypi.org/project/pycryptosat/, which can be installed separately.  Its release history seems to be out of sync with cryptominisat.

I am not sure i understand the rationale in favor of such a move:

- installing `pycryptosat` from `pypi` still requires that we ship `cryptominisat` binaries, so we just add one dependency without removing work on our side (worse, i guess we will have to ensure that the `pycryptosat` shipped by the author in the tarball is *not* installed)

- relying on `pypi` + `pierrev` (the anonymous maintainer of `pycryptosat` in `pypi`) adds 2 intermediates, for which the web of trust is not very clear to me

- if `pycryptosat` shipped by `pypi` stops being updated, then we are locked to update `cryptominisat`

Or do you mean that we should make 2 spkg with different names (`cryptominisat` and `pycryptosat`) with the same upstream tarball, one with `sdh_make` and one with `sdh_pip_install` ?

Yes, this part at least would be a useful step, as the package will then work with the new separation of SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_VENV (see for example #32442)

OK. It seems nontrivial since the `python/README.rst` in the tarball states:

```
The pycryptosat python package compiles while compiling CryptoMiniSat. It
cannotbe compiled on its own, it must be compiled at the same time as
CryptoMiniSat.
```

So, perhaps the way is to keep a single spkg, compile the whole, and then install the various stuff according to the respective variables SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_VENV ?

That wouldn't work so well because of the way how we keep installation records for packages.

I think we should try to split it into two packages and just build, but not install, the library a second time.

I suspect a variable is empty when it shouldn't. It may just be a matter of an extra option, but it could be a windows special.

This is where cmake says it fails

```
string(REPLACE "\n" " " PY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG ${PY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG})
```
If shared linking doesn't make sense on cygwin, it is not looking good.

Thanks. I always forgot how those two files are usually useless. I don't think we can easily build the python interface on cygwin. Mostly because to build the python module it wants dynamic flags - on linux for example

```
-- Found python interpreter, libs and header files
-- Building python interface
-- Python CFLAGS:  '-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG'
-- Python LDFLAGS: '-ldl  -lm'
-- Python LINKFORSHARED flags: '-Xlinker -export-dynamic'
-- Python module installation prefix: --prefix=/usr
```
If we can hand feed an appropriate `-DPY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG=...` to cmake on cygwin, we may be able to get something. The other option is to turn off python support on the platform :(

Anyone wanting to test flags can do so by running

```
EXTRA_OPTS="-DPY_LINKFORSHARED_CONFIG='$my_flags'" ./sage -i cryptominisat
```
courtesy of the cmake configure line in `spkg-install.in`

```
sdh_cmake -DUSE_GAUSS='ON' $EXTRA_OPTS
```

I was talking about https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/issues/684 which I guess means there were no `CFLAGS`.

Hi, this is upstream talking :) Yep, that is a big mess. Sorry. So, I fixed it up, and it's waaaaay more modern now. Also, there is a Python package, with pip install working etc:

https://pypi.org/project/pycryptosat/

Auto-builds the binary package using [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) actions so that's sweet. Let me know how it could be changed to be better. However, I think it should be a lot closer to "good" than the previous setup.
