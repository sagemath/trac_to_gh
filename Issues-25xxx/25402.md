Using Sage 8.3.beta2:

```
sage: L = EllipticCurve("24a1").modular_form().lseries(); L
L-series associated to the cusp form q - q^3 - 2*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: L(-1)
0.000000000000000
sage: L.taylor_series(-1, 3)
-0.702565506265199 + 0.638929001045535*z + 0.526515658001218*z^2 + O(z^3)
```
The terms of the Taylor series appear fine, just shifted:

```
sage: def D_n(f):
....:     return lambda x: (f(x+10^-4)-f(x))/10^-4
....: 
sage: D_n(L)(-1)
-0.702501608100647
sage: D_n(D_n(L))(-1) / 2
0.639086906100705
sage: D_n(D_n(D_n(L)))(-1) / 6
0.526090199182150
```
Not sure if this is a problem in the underlying Pari code or, maybe, the !Sage/Pari interface.

Another 1 line fix it seems :)!

Yes I think so, I'll try and email Tim Dokchitser.
Funnily enough  while I don't know what the problem is for sure, I have a fix in this case, changing the line in `sage/ext/pari/dokchitser/computel.gp.template` that reads `gmser=fullgammaseries_$i(ss,der)/t^(S+ss);` to `gmser=fullgammaseries_$i(ss,der + 1)/t^(S+ss);` and remaking everything (I don't know how to properly just update this script in `SAGE_EXTCODE`...) gets us nice taylor expansions around 0, e.g.

```
sage: L2 = EllipticCurve("37a1").modular_form().lseries(); L2
L-series associated to the cusp form q - 2*q^2 - 3*q^3 + 2*q^4 - 2*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: L2.taylor_series(0,4)
0.000000000000000 - 0.357620466127498*z + 0.273373112603865*z^2 + 0.303362857047671*z^3 + O(z^4)
sage: L2.taylor_series(0,1)
O(z^1)
sage: L2(0)
0.000000000000000
```
It seems that dividing by `t^S` makes fullgammaseries not have as many terms as it thinks it should? So that the next line fails to get the coefficient of `O(S^der)`, so computing 1 extra term to begin with saves us?

Also when I googled the error message I found [https://www.few.vu.nl/~sdn249/modularforms16/SageMathIntro.pdf](https://www.few.vu.nl/~sdn249/modularforms16/SageMathIntro.pdf) where the same error occurs for a different example so I have cc'd pbruin in case he also thought about this before or was interested.
