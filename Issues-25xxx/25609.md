```
This is a side improvement of #25477, as seen there in comment 62 (please properly link if possible):

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)])
sage: l = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
sage: %timeit P(l, check=False)
The slowest run took 7.58 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 44.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Permutation(l, check_input=False)
The slowest run took 7.85 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.74 µs per loop
```

So creating a new permutation is much faster than creating a permutation group element. If we know which permutation group we live in, there is even a faster way:

```
sage: one = P.one()
sage: %timeit one._generate_new(l)
The slowest run took 128.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 241 ns per loop
```
