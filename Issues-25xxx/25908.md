Keywords: printing, padicIMA

We make the print representation of p-adic extensions shorter and clearer (in order to prepare #23218).

For example, the different outputs below from before this ticket:

```
sage: R.<a> = ZqCR(25, 40); R
Unramified Extension in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
with capped relative precision 40 over 5-adic Ring

sage: R.<a> = ZqCA(25, 40); R
Unramified Extension in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
with capped absolute precision 40 over 5-adic Ring

sage: R.<a> = ZqFM(25, 40); R
Unramified Extension in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
of fixed modulus 5^40 over 5-adic Ring

sage: R.<a> = ZqFP(25, 40); R
Unramified Extension in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
with floating precision 40 over 5-adic Ring
```
become the same shorter outpout after this ticket:

```
sage: R.<a> = ZqCR(25, 40); R
5-adic Unramified Extension Ring in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2

sage: R.<a> = ZqCA(25, 40); R
5-adic Unramified Extension Ring in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2

sage: R.<a> = ZqFM(25, 40); R
5-adic Unramified Extension Ring in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2

sage: R.<a> = ZqFP(25, 40); R
5-adic Unramified Extension Ring in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
```
