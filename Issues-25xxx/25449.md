The following code fails for all primes between 46349 and 65521, i.e., the primes between `sqrt(2^31-1)` and `2^16`.

```python
sage: k = GF(55667)
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(k)
sage: R.<t> = k[]
sage: t(x)
TypeError: Cannot convert sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int64 to sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int
```

```

You could try to use a lazy_import instead?

Otherwise the code looks perfectly reasonable.

Ok the reason for some of the doctest failures on my machine (any maybe the patchbot)
