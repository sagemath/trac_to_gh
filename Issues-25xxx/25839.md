We can initialize a ProjectiveSpace object as follows:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```

However, we get a strange, unclear error when we try

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```

A univariate or multivariate single variable polynomial ring should both construct a projective space of dimension 0. The univariate case fails.

Actually, I think the fix here should be the univariate ring does construct a dim 0 projecive space (which is just a single point). For example, for single variable multivariate polynomial rings everything works just fine

```
P=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,0)
R=P.coordinate_ring()
ProjectiveSpace(R)
```

So I think the line

```
if is_MPolynomialRing(n) and R is None:
```
just to needs to be an `or` for is_Poly or is_MPoly

 sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
 ```
 
-The error should be clear on why this fails. Namely we can't construct a ProjectiveSpace given only a univariate polynomial ring, since that would imply the construction of a projective space of dimension 0.
+A univariate or multivariate single variable polynomial ring should both construct a projective space of dimension 0. The univariate case fails.
