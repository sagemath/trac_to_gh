We can initialize a ProjectiveSpace object as follows:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```

However, we get a strange, unclear error when we try

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(R)
```

A univariate or multivariate single variable polynomial ring should both construct a projective space of dimension 0. The univariate case fails.
