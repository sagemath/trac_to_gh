I think it is good to put a comment in there explaining why this test is the way it is.

Also, I am presuming `total >= 0` (otherwise, there would be a bug when `terms = 0` and `total < 0`).

Sounds good.

> Also, I am presuming `total >= 0` (otherwise, there would be a bug when `terms = 0` and `total < 0`).

`total` is defined by `counts, total = self._precomp_counts(n, degree)`, and according to the documentation, `total` is a sum of cardinalities, so it had better be nonnegative.
