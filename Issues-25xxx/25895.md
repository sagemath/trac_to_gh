Done this. If `Lats` is a list of all 10-element lattices, then the time for

```
sum(1 for L in Lats if L.is_uniform())
```

drops from 26 seconds to 9 seconds with this patch.

Because the test for distributive is relatively expensive (and a stronger property?), I would not do it. One possibility is putting a `.. NOTE::` in the doc saying something like in your comment: that the distributive test is faster but more likely to fail. (Although perhaps stronger properties are easier to test for in general?)

Maybe... But that might depend on use case.

No, for example testing for semimodularity is faster that testing for modularity. But of course one can always test for a stronger property to get sure "yes"-answer, test for a weaker property to get sure "no"-answer, and only when needed to proceed testing the original property.
