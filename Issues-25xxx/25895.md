Done this. If `Lats` is a list of all 10-element lattices, then the time for

```
sum(1 for L in Lats if L.is_uniform())
```

drops from 26 seconds to 9 seconds with this patch.

Maybe... But that might depend on use case.

> (Although perhaps stronger properties are easier to test for in general?)


No, for example testing for semimodularity is faster that testing for modularity. But of course one can always test for a stronger property to get sure "yes"-answer, test for a weaker property to get sure "no"-answer, and only when needed to proceed testing the original property.
