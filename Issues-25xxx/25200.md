The long element is wrong:

```
sage: SP = SignedPermutations(5)
sage: SP.long_element()
[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
```
It should be

```
[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
```

It would be nice if the test would be against the theoretical known value.

I mean, if such a mistake was there, maybe the longest expression is not even the real longest element. After all, we know the length, so why not check against that value?
