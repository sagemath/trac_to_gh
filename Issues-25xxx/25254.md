Given a tensor field *T* on some differentiable manifold *M*, a differentiable manifold *U* and a differentiable map *F: U --> M*, this ticket implements the computation of the tensor field *t* along *U* with values in *M* that obeys 

forall *p* in *U*, *t(p) = T(F(p))*. 

If *F* is an immersion, *t* can be viewed as the tensor field *T* along the immersed submanifold *(U,F)*.

This work is part of the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), see #18528 for an overview.
