I'm fine with adding an spkg for it.  I think there should be one as some libffi versions *do* have bugs that could theoretically affect us.

But I do think there should be a configure-time check for it to avoid needlessly installing the spkg.  I would like to start adding this for all new packages.  For now it could go directly in `configure.ac`, but if *some* version of #24919 ever gets merged then the check might be moved.
