On a side note, the cygwin patchbot is unhappy with it

> Afaik libffi has been a de facto dependency of ecl (and, therefore, Sage) for a long time. We could just document said dependency...

I'm fine with adding an spkg for it.  I think there should be one as some libffi versions *do* have bugs that could theoretically affect us.

But I do think there should be a configure-time check for it to avoid needlessly installing the spkg.  I would like to start adding this for all new packages.  For now it could go directly in `configure.ac`, but if *some* version of #24919 ever gets merged then the check might be moved.

Odd that libffi puts its headers in `lib/libffi-3.2.1/include/`.  I found this to be the case on Cygwin and on Linux.  I guess it's not really a problem since `pkg-config` reports that location correctly, and I bet there's probably a good reason for it.  Just...odd.
