Unfortunately `find_library` doesn't work with nix (see [this](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/7307) issue) and apparently is only supposed to return the library filename (not the path) anyways.

To make it possible to use sage when find_library fails, this patch adds `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` as a fallback.
