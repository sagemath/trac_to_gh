In a few places in Sage, there are statements(!) of the form

```
A._coerce_(x)
```
where the result is not used.

The purpose is to check whether a coercion exists from `parent(x)` to `A`. Instead, this should be replaced by `has_coerce_map_from`. This is needed for porting to the new coercion model.
