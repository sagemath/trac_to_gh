This clearly works.

However, which parameters are usefull from graphs? Should we have just `certificate`-option?

Another thing, is it faster to compare `_hasse_diagram` instead of `hasse_diagram()`?

While I agree with Jori that it probably should be `_hasse_diagram`, that is outside of the scope of this ticket. (In fact, there are probably a few things that should be tweaks with that and/or have it lifted to the category.)

However, I think the generic `**kwds` is better than anything explicit because it is more future-proof and gives the user more flexibility.

One nitpick: could you add a reference to this ticket as part of the `TESTS::`?
