This continues the work in #20382 and #25835.

To test this I ran `./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages,database_cremona_ellcurve $( git diff --name-only HEAD~2 )`.

Next steps in getting rid of `is_package_installed` etc.:
- #30746 `sage.doctest.control`: Replace use of `sage.misc.package.list_packages`
- #30747 Deprecate all of `sage.misc.package` except for `PackageNotFoundError`

That would have the advantage that there would be only one way to get that information. Otherwise, it will be easy for future code to use the variable from `env.py` instead.

But there would be the disadvantage that it wouldn't be as easy anymore to figure out which variables can be set to configure locations.

@kiwifb as you were involved with `env.py`, do you have an opinion about that?

I added a mechanism to `StaticFile` that takes an environment variable as an override for `search_path`. It will then also notify the user of the existence of that search path when the file is not found. I like that solution even better than the `env.py` one.

For the record: I think `resolution()` should be refactored to return a list of lines for easier extensibility. The variable `resolution` should be removed because users can just override `resolution()` if they want to change the message. But that is out of scope of this ticket.

Also in the future I hope `search_path_override` could be replaced by a key in a configuration file instead of an env var.
