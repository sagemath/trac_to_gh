This continues the work in #20382 and #25835.

To test this I ran `./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages,database_cremona_ellcurve $( git diff --name-only HEAD~2 )`.

Next steps in getting rid of `is_package_installed` etc.:
- #30746 `sage.doctest.control`: Replace use of `sage.misc.package.list_packages`
- #30747 Deprecate all of `sage.misc.package` except for `PackageNotFoundError`
