This continues the work in #20382 and #25835.

To test this I ran `./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages,database_cremona_ellcurve $( git diff --name-only HEAD~2 )`.

Next steps in getting rid of `is_package_installed` etc.:
- #30746 `sage.doctest.control`: Replace use of `sage.misc.package.list_packages`
- #30747 Deprecate all of `sage.misc.package` except for `PackageNotFoundError`

That should probably use the environment variable I introduced in #25309 though. So that'll have to be merged first.

Yes, it's hardcoded in two different places which is bad design. There should be single source for it.

<a id='comment:30'>Comment 30:</a>
I'm not sure if features are the right choice / intended for that use case. In general I think detecting time at runtime usually causes problems. Would that feature then only provide a path?

CC'ing fbissey because this is related to #25309, which apparently created problems for him.

I think it should be a feature in particular because we should not handle the large database differently from the mini database.

The feature would tell you whether the mini database is present (which must be true) and provide its path. I think for the cremona DBs that's all we need.

That would have the advantage that there would be only one way to get that information. Otherwise, it will be easy for future code to use the variable from `env.py` instead.

But there would be the disadvantage that it wouldn't be as easy anymore to figure out which variables can be set to configure locations.

@kiwifb as you were involved with `env.py`, do you have an opinion about that?
