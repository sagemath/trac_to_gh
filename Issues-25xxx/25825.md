This continues the work in #20382 and #25835.

To test this I ran `./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages,database_cremona_ellcurve $( git diff --name-only HEAD~2 )`.

Next steps in getting rid of `is_package_installed` etc.:
- #30746 `sage.doctest.control`: Replace use of `sage.misc.package.list_packages`
- #30747 Deprecate all of `sage.misc.package` except for `PackageNotFoundError`

What do you mean by "discover"? It looks to me like the path to the database is just as hardcoded in the feature. Am I reading that wrong?

That should probably use the environment variable I introduced in #25309 though. So that'll have to be merged first.

Yes, it's hardcoded in two different places which is bad design. There should be single source for it.

It's a standard package in Sage-the-distribution but it still makes sense to use the feature infrastructure as it might make things easier for (us) packagers. Even if we always ship it we can rely on the features detecting the correct paths for things.

I think it should be a feature in particular because we should not handle the large database differently from the mini database.

The feature would tell you whether the mini database is present (which must be true) and provide its path. I think for the cremona DBs that's all we need.

Should I then remove `CREMONA_{LARGE,MINI}_DATA_DIR` entirely from `env.py` and instead read the variable directly (with fallback) in the feature?

That would have the advantage that there would be only one way to get that information. Otherwise, it will be easy for future code to use the variable from `env.py` instead.

But there would be the disadvantage that it wouldn't be as easy anymore to figure out which variables can be set to configure locations.

@kiwifb as you were involved with `env.py`, do you have an opinion about that?
