This continues the work in #20382 and #25835.

To test this I ran `./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages,database_cremona_ellcurve $( git diff --name-only HEAD~2 )`.

Next steps in getting rid of `is_package_installed` etc.:
- #30746 `sage.doctest.control`: Replace use of `sage.misc.package.list_packages`
- #30747 Deprecate all of `sage.misc.package` except for `PackageNotFoundError`

Should I then remove `CREMONA_{LARGE,MINI}_DATA_DIR` entirely from `env.py` and instead read the variable directly (with fallback) in the feature?

That would have the advantage that there would be only one way to get that information. Otherwise, it will be easy for future code to use the variable from `env.py` instead.

But there would be the disadvantage that it wouldn't be as easy anymore to figure out which variables can be set to configure locations.

@kiwifb as you were involved with `env.py`, do you have an opinion about that?

I added a mechanism to `StaticFile` that takes an environment variable as an override for `search_path`. It will then also notify the user of the existence of that search path when the file is not found. I like that solution even better than the `env.py` one.

For the record: I think `resolution()` should be refactored to return a list of lines for easier extensibility. The variable `resolution` should be removed because users can just override `resolution()` if they want to change the message. But that is out of scope of this ticket.

Also in the future I hope `search_path_override` could be replaced by a key in a configuration file instead of an env var.
