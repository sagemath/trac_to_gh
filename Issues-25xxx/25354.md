Since in nix every python package is in its own directory (as opposed to all python packages being in the python directory), I need to add the cysignals dir to include_directories.

Debian [adds](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/58bbba93a807ca2933ca317501d093a1bb4b84db/debian/patches/d0-libgap-sage.patch#L84) a custom libgap path.

This patch makes it possible to extend the `include_directories` by setting a `PATH`-like, colon seperated environment variable `SAGE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.

So how does this work? Are all those directories then added to `sys.path`?

I have some doubts about your patch because it should just work even if cysignals is installed in a different directory. So I'd like to see exactly what fails when you don't add any new include directories.

For simple python packages yes. A wrapper script is generated that adds all dependencies to `sys.path`. If non-python software depends on python packages, its also possible to generate a python environment with those dependencies. A python environment is a symlink tree with the python interpreter and all the specified packages symlinked together.

Now that I think about it its a bit weird, because I chose the second (symlink tree) option for sage (necessary because sage interfaces with the `python` binary). Even if my use-case didn't exist, there would still be the debian use case.

I don't have any build results cached, so I'll have to do a full rebuild to find the exact error. So that'll take a while.

That's a test for a deprecated file, so you might as well ignore that failure. It's not worth the effort to fix it.

If that's your only motivation for this ticket, I prefer to close this as "wontfix".

It should (haven't tried yet, but I don't see why not) fix the test failure. Is the cysignals include dir really not needed anywhere else except in that test? If so, that fixes my problem.

If I needed to patch sage anyways, I might as well add the include.
