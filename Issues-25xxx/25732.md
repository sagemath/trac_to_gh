So...don't do that?  The proper way to "clean" a previous package installation is to run `make clean-pkgconf`.  Just deleting the stamp file doesn't mean the previous installation is removed.

Replying to [@embray](#comment:1):
> So...don't do that?

So what if

(1) the wrong data is written to `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf` due to a bug?

(2) the uninstaller didn't work due to a bug?

(3) something crashed and the filesystem state is no longer consistent with `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf`

As shown on #25731, (1) has happened already and (3) is certainly possible.
