So...don't do that?  The proper way to "clean" a previous package installation is to run `make clean-pkgconf`.  Just deleting the stamp file doesn't mean the previous installation is removed.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A1):
> So...don't do that?

So what if

(1) the wrong data is written to `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf` due to a bug?

(2) the uninstaller didn't work due to a bug?

(3) something crashed and the filesystem state is no longer consistent with `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf`

As shown on #25731, (1) has happened already and (3) is certainly possible.

How to handle a bug in the packaging system in general?  You know there's no one right answer to that.  If the system is in an inconsistent state that it may require some untangling.  The problem with Sage's software "distribution" is that it's historically never really had a well-defined consistent state in the first place.
