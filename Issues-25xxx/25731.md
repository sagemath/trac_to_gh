In `build/sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py` there is

```
            print("Warning: Directory '{0}' not found".format(
                cur_dir), file=sys.stderr)
```
but the variable `cur_dir` is not defined.

More concretely, Rebecca Miller got this error:

```
sage-spkg-uninstall pkgconf '/Users/RebeccaMiller/sage-develop/local'

Uninstalling existing 'pkgconf'

Warning: File '/share/man/man1/pkgconf.1' not found

Error during uninstallation of 'pkgconf': global name 'cur_dir' is not defined

I've seen this when upgrading from 8.3.beta6 to 8.3.beta7 – see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/H5pcrftzR8c/MxNx2dlEBwAJ – but in my case, it did not result in the `make` process ending.
