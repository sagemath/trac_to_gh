My reasoning (cf. the commit message) was that Karatsuba's algorithm performs more additions in the base field, but additions in a fraction field are slower than multiplications—typically at least, I can't promise that this holds 100% of the time!

Just a thought, how does extracting a common denominator, multiplying over the base integral domain (presumably with Karatsuba then), and putting the common denominators compare in general? That might be a useful approach for general fraction fields?

For comparison I get

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
....: Q.<y> = Frac(P)[]
....: foo = ((-2*x^2 - 2*x + 3)/(x^2 + 1/3*x + 1/4))*y^20 + (-3/2/(-4/5*x^2))*y^19 + ((2/3*x + 4)/(1/
....: 8*x^2 - x - 1/7))*y^18 + ((1/16*x^2 + x - 1)/(-x^2 + 2*x - 5))*y^17 + ((-5/716*x^2 - 1/4*x + 1/
....: 4)/(-1/2*x^2 + x - 1))*y^16 + ((-x^2 - 13*x)/(x^2 - 8*x - 2))*y^15 + ((x^2 + 4/5*x - 1)/(x^2 -
....: 1/14*x + 1/145))*y^14 + ((-2*x^2 - 1/2*x - 1/2)/(x^2 + x + 1))*y^13 + ((-x^2 + 14*x - 1)/(-6*x
....: + 1/4))*y^12 + ((2*x^2 + 3*x - 2)/(-x^2 + 3*x - 2))*y^11 + ((-x + 1)/(1/4*x + 1/3))*y^10 + ((-1
....: /8*x + 1/45)/(-x^2 - 1/4))*y^9 + ((-9/11*x^2 - 2/7*x + 2/5)/(-4*x - 1))*y^8 + ((-x^2 + 1/2*x -
....: 1)/(-x^2 + 7*x - 28))*y^7 + ((-3*x^2 + 2/25*x - 2)/(7*x^2 + 3/28*x))*y^6 + ((1/14*x^2 - x + 2/5
....: )/(-14*x^2 + 1/6))*y^5 + ((-3/2*x^2 + 3*x)/(1/43*x - 3))*y^4 + ((6*x^2 - 5*x + 1/27)/(1/20*x^2
....: + 3*x + 3))*y^3 + ((x^2 - 5*x - 4/5)/(2/5*x^2 - 2/9*x - 11/6))*y^2 + ((-1/10*x^2 + x)/(-1/4*x^2
....:  + 6*x - 1/2))*y + (43*x^2 + x + 1/3)/(-17/4*x - 6/7)
....:
sage: %time t = ((foo*foo.denominator())^4)/foo.denominator()^4
CPU times: user 451 ms, sys: 2.66 ms, total: 454 ms
Wall time: 463 ms
sage: %time t = foo^4
CPU times: user 1.79 s, sys: 15.7 ms, total: 1.81 s
Wall time: 1.84 s
```

I didn't try your non-karatsuba version on my laptop yet but given that the speedup is a factor of 4 in this example I believe it is better for this case at least. Maybe this is better on another ticket at any rate?

I also tried something like that—In fact, I have a draft branch to implement polynomials over fraction fields that use this representation throughout, but I didn't manage to make it fast. But yes, I do think some variant fo that is the way to go!
