There is a t-deformation of multiplicities of imaginary roots in a Kac-Moody root system that appears in a correction factor in many p-adic formulas. 

Implement generalized Peterson algorithm for computing these deformed multiplicities. This involves using or producing the data of real roots. 

For details on the correction factor containing this t-deformation as well as the algorithm, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05212 and  https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05209

Attached code only works in hyperbolic types, and is inefficient about producing the data of real roots. The enumeration of the real roots is the main problem outside hyperbolic type.
