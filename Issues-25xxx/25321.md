In `build/pkgs/coxeter3/spkg-install`, the line

```
sed -i "s|@SAGE_LOCAL@|$SAGE_LOCAL|g" directories.h
```
does not work under macOS because `sed -i` is not portable. (It prints an error and continues, and it does not change the file `directories.h`.) Under macOS, the following works:

```
sed -e "s|@SAGE_LOCAL@|$SAGE_LOCAL|g" -i '' directories.h
```
but I'm not sure this works with GNU sed.

Does someone know a portable invocation of sed that would work here?
Otherwise, could we detect the OS, and use an appropriate invocation?

The [answer by kine](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22084103) to that
StackOverflow question creates an extra file that then needs to be deleted.

The [answer by nwinkler](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51060063) there
might be better, but it has had no upvotes at StackOverflow.
