Combinatorial class of packed words

These object are trivially in bijection with Ordered set partitions. (counted by the Fubini numbers (A000670))

(use in the Hopf algebra WQSym)

This ticket is a replacement for the old ticket #15611 which should be closed.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I can't provide any useful feedback on the math, but here are a few minor nitpicks:

```diff
+#       Copyright (C) 2012 Jean-Baptiste Priez <jbp@kerios.fr>,
```

I assume you'll want to update this to 2018

```diff
+    :func:`sage.combinat.permutation.to_standard`) for *packed words*.
+    EXEMPLES::
```

EXEMPLES -> EXAMPLES; also I think normally there should be an additional blank line before the "EXAMPLES" heading.

```diff
+    for set in li:
+        for p in set:
+            dic[p] = i
+        i += 1
```

Please try to avoid using Python built-ins like `set` as a variable name.  It's reasonably unambiguous here, but can still be confusing (especially to editors).  If you're hell-bend on naming the variable "set", I'll sometimes do something like `_set` or `set_`.

```diff
+    return PackedWord(dic.values())
```

For Python 3 compatibility please make sure that `PackedWord` can accept an arbitrary iterable its argument.  I believe this might already be the case for `ClonableArray` and subclasses thereof, but I'm not positive.  Otherwise, this would have be something like `list(dic.values())` unfortunately.

```diff
+            #sage: PackedWord([2,2,1,0,4])
+            #Traceback (most recent call last)
+            #...
+            #AssertionError: This is not a packed word
```
this is commented out for some reason?

```diff
+        assert(len(s) == 0 or (max(s) == len(s) and min(s) == 1)
+            ), "This is not a packed word %s" % str(self)
```

`str(self)` is unnecessary; it can just be `self` (the `str()` is implied by the `%s` format code).  I think we're mostly preferring new-style string formatting these days, but I don't think there's a policy either way.

```diff
+        import collections
```

Please avoid in-line imports unless it's absolutely necessary.  I guarantee `collections` is already being imported elsewhere in Sage, so there's no reason not to put it at the top-level of the module.

There are some other in-line imports elsewhere you might want to check on.  For imports from Sage this is sometimes more necessary to avoid circular imports or slow import times, though a lot of that can also be avoided using `LazyImport` instead.

```diff
+        return [Set(d[k]) for k in sorted(d.keys())]
```

`.keys()` is unnecessary here; just `sorted(d)` will work.

```diff
+    def combinatorial_class_of_size(self, size):
+        assert(size >= 0), "size (%d) must be a positive integer" % size
+        return PackedWords(size)
```

Missing docstring here.

```diff
+        if res.size() != self._size:
+            raise ValueError, "Wrong size of word"
+        return res
```

This is old-style `raise` syntax which should not be used.  Instead use `raise ValueError("Wrong size of word")`.

General comment: Please also use spaces around operators such as `>` and `+` and after commas more often than not, in PEP-8 style.

<a id='comment:11'></a>* I think it would be better to avoid `Set` in library code.  It comes with great performance penalty.

* A proposal for a replacement of the introductory text:

```
Packed words are a way to represent ordered set partitions.
A word `w` with letters in `\{1,...,n\}` is a packed word if for each number `k > 1` appearing in `w`, the number `k - 1` appears in `w` too.

Thus, `w` can be obtained from an ordered set partition by setting `w_i=j` if `i` belongs to the `j`-th block.
```

<a id='comment:17'></a>Minor docstring comments:

* Lots of docstrings that should be sentences are missing periods.

* check() method docstring should be 'Check that' not 'Checks that' (there may be a few other minor grammatical things like that).

* to_ordered_set_partition() docstring should start 'Build an' not 'This method build an'

* to_composition() should mention what a parikh vector is.

* In the docstrings for inversion and coinversions, I'm not sure if the use of the individual character for an exponentiated 2 will work in general

*left_weak_order_greater docstring should say 'information' not 'informations'

* packed_word_size __init__ method doesn't have a doctest.

<a id='comment:25'></a>First of all, thank you Travis for all the improvements.

Your remarque on inversions make me rework on it. I think it is better to based it on 1 because it is that way on permutations and the coherence is important.

Also I have some other remarques and questions :
* The terme **coinversion** is not good so I think it's better to name it **inversions_value_left**, **inversions_position_right**...
* But now I'm realizing that it might be better to use options like //inversions(side="right",support="position")//. What do you think ?
* An other question is : is it a good convention to return the (greater,lower) when thes are **values** and (lower,greater) when thes are **positions** ?

<a id='comment:38'></a>I think this ticket is now ready for a deeper-than-superficial glance.

**Two questions for Hugo:**

* Is there a quick way to check whether or not something is greater / lesser
   in right- or left-weak order? E.g., for ordinary weak order, `pi < sigma` if 
   the inversions of `pi` (or `pi.inverse()`) are a subset of that of `sigma` (or `sigma.inverse()`)

* Doing some computations, it looks like the left and right posets are graded. Is that so? If so, I think it would be better to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` to search for elements in the interval [u1, u2] instead of building all of `u1.right_weak_order_greater()`

If either of the above are true, then I believe you can speed-up your interval code.

And **one question for others** regarding check/contains/element_constructor/eq:

* is this the right convention?: 
   we want `a in B` is "True" if and only if `a == B(a)` is "True"   

I didn't actually check this yet, but thought I'd ask.

Well, for `a == B(a)`, that also runs a coercion, so it (generically) roughly does `B(a) == B(a)`. What you are really after is does `B(a)` fail or not (but often `B(a)` does the containment check before proceeding).

.

I'm not quite sure what I'm after, but thought the equality test might be part of the story...

I see very different behavior within `Partitions`, `SetPartitions` and `OrderedSetPartitions`:

```
sage: [2,1] in Partitions()
True
sage: [{1,2},{3}] in SetPartitions()
False
sage: [[1,2],[3]] in OrderedSetPartitions()
True
sage: [[1,2],[3]] in OrderedSetPartitions(3)
False
sage: [set([1,2]), set([3])] in OrderedSetPartitions(3)
TypeError: X (=set([1, 2])) must be a Set
```

I'm not sure which convention to follow. And consequently, I'm not sure how to divvy up the tasks of creating elements between `check`, `__contains__`, and `_element_constructor_`.

<a id='comment:45'></a>Mostly looks good. Some comments:

IMO, it is better to not have as much shorthand, so ``\forall i <= d < j, u_i > u_j`.` -> ``u_i > u_j` for all `i \leq d < j.``

Formatting change

```
    TODO:

        - perhaps reformat the display of packed words of sizes 0..3.
          (I need to look at the documentation to see.)
```

```
    .. TODO::

        Perhaps reformat the display of packed words of sizes 0..3.
```
or is that a todo for yourself before including it into Sage?

```diff
-        ``osp`` -- an object or iterable (e.g., a list of lists)
-        that defines an ordered set partition.
+        - ``osp`` -- an object or iterable (e.g., a list of lists)
+          that defines an ordered set partition
```

The `TODO:` in the `_element_constructor_` does make sense to do and can be removed.

`.. rubric::` -> `.. RUBRIC::`

I don't understand why there is a `.. rubric` in the `OUTPUT:` of `inversions`. It looks more like it is just in the wrong place.

```diff
-        - ``side`` -- "left" or "right": the side of the weak order of inversions
-        - ``support`` -- "position" or "value": the support of the result
+        - ``side`` -- ``"left"`` or ``"right"``; the side of the weak order of inversions
+        - ``support`` -- ``"position"`` or ``"value"``; the support of the result
```

<a id='comment:61'></a>Okay, this wasn't too hard to track down (see below). I should have a fix pushed today.

```
sage: P = PackedWords()
sage: w = P.an_element(); w
[]
sage: pw = P(w); pw
[]
sage: w.parent()
Packed words of size 0
sage: pw.parent()
Packed words
sage: w == pw
False
```

<a id='comment:71'></a>Hi, I made some tests and I found an other unexpected result : 

```
sage: p = PackedWords(3).random_element()
sage: p == PackedWord(p)
False
sage: type(p)
<class '__main__.PackedWords_size_with_category.element_class'>
sage: type(PackedWord(p))
<class '__main__.PackedWords_all_with_category.element_class'>
```

One solution I found to prevent this is to replace the last line of the file

```
return self.element_class(self, osp.to_packed_word(), check=False)
```
by 

```
 return PackedWord(osp.to_packed_word())
```
But it might not be the best solution.

About the questions above, it goes beyond my skills.

In the method `pack`, replace `uniq(li)` with `sorted(set(li))`. You can also remove the associated import for `uniq`.

TestSuite is having an issue with `add_constraints`, though I can't tell what it's trying to do well enough to guess what it may be.
