```
g = DiGraph({0: [1]}, immutable=True)
sage.graphs.comparability.is_comparability(g)
```

outputs `IndexError: list index out of range`. Works with `immutable=False`.

This follows from this:

```
g = DiGraph({0: [1]}, immutable=True)
print g.neighbors(1)

g = DiGraph({0: [1]}, immutable=False)
print g.neighbors(1)
```

which outputs `0` and `1`.

LGTM modulo two trivial things:

- Could you add a test showing the need for the `seen` set (to help prevent regressions)?
- Why the `print` in this test: `print(g.neighbors_in(1))`?
