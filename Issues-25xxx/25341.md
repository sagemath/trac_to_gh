This updates cddlib to the latest version available at

    ftp://ftp.math.ethz.ch/users/fukudak/cdd/cddlib-094i.tar.gz

Unfortunately there is one small regression I don't quite understand: The doctest introduced in #14479 (then checking for an exception) and amended in #13026 (no longer an exception) throws an exception again.

Thus I had to revert 269c1e1551285.

The patch for 0.94g -> 0.94h was taken from debian.
