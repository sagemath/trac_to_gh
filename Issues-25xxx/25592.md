enum_affine_rational_field function misses some points, consider the example shown below.

```
sage: A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(2, QQ)
sage: C = Curve(x^2+y-x)
sage: enum_affine_rational_field(C, 10)
[(-2, -6), (-1, -2), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, -2), (3, -6)]
```
but 

```
(-2/3, -10/9)
(-1/2, -3/4)
(-1/3, -4/9)
(1/3, 2/9)
(1/2, 1/4)
(2/3, 2/9)
(3/2, -3/4)
```
also lie on the scheme, and satisfy height bound.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This looks fine. Although I made a slight change to be more memory efficient. We don't need to create and store the entire list of points in the rational case. I think that is worth the slight penalty of the 'if' we must check once per dimension.

If you think new version is fine, I'll mark this positive.

I think there would be a trade off between memory and time, which one would be significant would be deciding.
