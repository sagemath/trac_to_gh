enum_affine_rational_field function misses some points, consider the example shown below.

```
sage: A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(2, QQ)
sage: C = Curve(x^2+y-x)
sage: enum_affine_rational_field(C, 10)
[(-2, -6), (-1, -2), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, -2), (3, -6)]
```
but 

```
(-2/3, -10/9)
(-1/2, -3/4)
(-1/3, -4/9)
(1/3, 2/9)
(1/2, 1/4)
(2/3, 2/9)
(3/2, -3/4)
```
also lie on the scheme, and satisfy height bound.

This looks fine. Although I made a slight change to be more memory efficient. We don't need to create and store the entire list of points in the rational case. I think that is worth the slight penalty of the 'if' we must check once per dimension.

If you think new version is fine, I'll mark this positive.

Sir, but isn't that calling range_by_height function every time would have some time penalty? (it calculates `gcd` for `H^2` times each of which would have a complexity of `log(m) + log(n)`).

I think there would be a trade off between memory and time, which one would be significant would be deciding.
