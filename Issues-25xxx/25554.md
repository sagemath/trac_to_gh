The code for `RingMap_lift` uses some internal functions of the old coercion model (`Parent_old`). There is an example involving matrix spaces which breaks with #25319 because `MatrixSpace` becomes a new-style parent.

Instead, we should implement `RingMap_lift` using proper coercion maps, which are supported by the old and new coercion model.
