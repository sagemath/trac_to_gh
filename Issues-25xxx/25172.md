This ticket will implement the basis of the quasi-symmetric functions (and the dual basis in the non-commutative symmetric functions) called the Young quasi-Schur basis. 
 It is described in section 5.2 in http://www.math.ubc.ca/~steph/papers/QuasiSchurBook.pdf .  It is related to the quasi-Schur basis by `YQS(al) = QS(al.reverse()).star_involution()` .

It will also add the Zassenhaus bases to the shorthands in non-commutative symmetric functions.
