Yes, why not... I'm not sure it is worth the pain now—I'm not really trying to make this operation as fast as possible, just to avoid the worst of the overhead (especially in the Karatsuba range). So I'm not going to implement your suggestion now, but perhaps later, and in any case I can review the implementation if you want to do it yourself.

Thanks for you comments in any case!

Running the same test as in the description.

8.3.beta0:

```
sage: %timeit p*q
The slowest run took 2129.02 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.02 µs per loop
```
Your branch:

```
sage: %timeit p*q
The slowest run took 9.36 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.78 µs per loop
```
My branch:

```
The slowest run took 8.63 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.21 µs per loop
```
So my changes get us an extra ~20%.
