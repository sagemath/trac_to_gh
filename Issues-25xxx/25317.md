Yes, why not... I'm not sure it is worth the pain now—I'm not really trying to make this operation as fast as possible, just to avoid the worst of the overhead (especially in the Karatsuba range). So I'm not going to implement your suggestion now, but perhaps later, and in any case I can review the implementation if you want to do it yourself.

Thanks for you comments in any case!
