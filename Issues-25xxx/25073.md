Maybe add coordinates to vertices (at geographical center of states? or at capital's coordinates maybe)

Removed. I added it as a parallel to two other maps, but new states have not been added to USA for some time.

> Maybe add coordinates to vertices (at geographical center of states? or at capital's coordinates maybe)

Something like that can be added later. I don't know if coordinates are needed, but instead some natural value for edge labels for neighbors. That could be usefull to demonstrate some function ("cheapest travel by rain from Nevada to..." as an example to `shortest_path` etc.) However I haven't figured out anything natural and constant enought.
