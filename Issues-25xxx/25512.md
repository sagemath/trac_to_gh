While this

```python
return (True, LaurentPolynomial_univariate(self._parent, r, self.__n // 2))
```
is okay for now, it is not future-proof if we have a subclass of `LaurentPolynomial_univariate`. It would be better to do

```python
return (True, type(self)(self._parent, r, self.__n // 2))
```

Bikeshedding (so feel free to ignore), but I'd rather see `elif root:` -> `if root:` to better indicate that the previous block is meant to stop.

On the other hand, all other methods create new Laurent polynomial this way. I don't have any strong opinion on the way it should be done but I have a strong opinion on the fact that it should be the same in all methods.

For this I don't agree. It is much easier to read a `if/elif/elif/else` rather a `if/if/if/if` where you have to think whether the other blocks meant to stopped.

I have a strong opinion that it should be done this way and to not to make things worse on new code. Doing things a bad way just because it was done that way in the past is not a good argument.
