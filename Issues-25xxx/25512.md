While this

```python
return (True, LaurentPolynomial_univariate(self._parent, r, self.__n // 2))
```
is okay for now, it is not future-proof if we have a subclass of `LaurentPolynomial_univariate`. It would be better to do

```python
return (True, type(self)(self._parent, r, self.__n // 2))
```

Bikeshedding (so feel free to ignore), but I'd rather see `elif root:` -> `if root:` to better indicate that the previous block is meant to stop.

On the other hand, all other methods create new Laurent polynomial this way. I don't have any strong opinion on the way it should be done but I have a strong opinion on the fact that it should be the same in all methods. If you feel like it has to change, it would better be part of another ticket as I don't want to modify other methods.

For this I don't agree. It is much easier to read a `if/elif/elif/else` rather a `if/if/if/if` where you have to think whether the other blocks meant to stopped.

I have a strong opinion that it should be done this way and to not to make things worse on new code. Doing things a bad way just because it was done that way in the past is not a good argument.
