The following lines currently occur:

```
sage: A = polytopes.associahedron(['A',3])
sage: face = A.faces(2)[3]
sage: face
<6,8,9,10>
sage: face.as_polyhedron()
/home/jplabbe/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:590: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: 'Associahedra_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute '_cartan_type'

```

The construction `as_polyhedron` initializes the new (face-)polyhedron via `P.__class__(parent, Vrep, None)`. In the case of the associahedron, this does not give a valid object, as the associahedron requires a cartan type as well.

Same (or similar problem) with:

- `minkowski_sum`,
- `minkowski_difference`,
- `translation`,
- `dilation`,
- `convex_hull`,
- `intersection` (actually even worse as coercion fails),
- `polar`.

We fix the initialization of the associahedron to now require the cartan type on `__init__` (before it was assumed to be set after initialization).

Further we have `__new__` return the correct parent class such that e.g. the face of an `Associahedron_class_ppl` is constructed as `Polyhedron_ppl`.

We fix `_coerce_map_from_` to take into account that no general polyhedron can be coerced to an associahedron.

We manually set the correct pushout of polyhedra over ZZ and associahedra (over QQ) to be polyhedra over QQ.

Feel free to change it, alter it, abonden it, etc.

Maybe there is a better way to obtain the correct parent, i.e. improve the following lines:

```
156             for typ1 in ancestors_of_associahedron:
157                 if typ1 in mro:
158                     return typ1(parent, Vrep, Hrep, **kwds)

<a id='comment:13'></a>I don't have any comments on the Cartan side as you are not really doing anything with them. However, I do have one comment about this code block:

```python
            for typ1 in ancestors_of_associahedron:
                if typ1 in mro:
                    return typ1(parent, Vrep, Hrep, **kwds)
```
My understanding is there is no subclass relations among the classes in `ancestors_of_associahedron`. So I think it is faster to make that a `set` object and test

```python
            for typ1 in mro:
                if typ1 in ancestors_of_associahedron:
                    return typ1(parent, Vrep, Hrep, **kwds)
```
as `set` containment check is much faster and these classes are likely to be higher in the MRO. It also has a side effect of making all of these classes run in the same time. For example, imagine if you are looking for a `Polyhedron_polymake`, that means it has to check the through the entire MRO 4 times (and a bit more to actually find it). So this could become really expensive if you create lots of (temporary) associahedra.
