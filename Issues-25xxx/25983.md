Initial report:

> The output of `divisors(n)` for integer `n` appears to be sorted.

>
> If true, this should be documented, so users don't unnecessarily call `sorted(divisors(n))`.

>
> Same for `prime_divisors` and `squarefree_divisors`.


It turns out that for integer `n`, both `divisors(n)` and `prime_divisors(n)`
are sorted in increasing order.

On the other hand, for `squarefree_divisors(n)` the order comes from
using powerset of the list of prime divisors of `n` and in general will
not coincide with the increasing order.

This ticket makes sure the documentation documents that.

<a id='comment:12'></a>This ticket was opened to document that divisors are returned sorted
in increasing order.

Should we review that, and open one (ore more) follow-up ticket(s) to

- make `divisors` and `prime_divisors` return unsorted output by default
- provide an iterator variant for `divisors` and `prime_divisors`

I'm also happy if this ticket is repurposed to something more useful...
but I would not know where to start for that, and I'm afraid this stays stalled.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Thanks for these comments. I took them into account.

For `squarefree_divisors(n)` the order comes from using powerset of
the list of prime divisors of `n` and in general will not coincide with
the increasing order.
For example, the list of prime divisors of 30 is [2, 3, 5], and the
powers can be [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], giving the squarefree divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 10, 15, 30.

The order that squarefree divisors of an integer are returned in can
be described as follows. 

Denote by `p` the list of prime divisors of `n` sorted in increasing order,
and let `k = len(p)`; then there are `2^k` squarefree divisors of `n` to list.

Let `s` be their list, so that these divisors are `s[j]` for `j` ranging from
`0` to `2^k - 1`.

If `b` is the bit sequence corresponding to `j`,
so that `j = sum(2^b[i] for i in range(k))`,
then `s[j] = prod(p[i]^b[i] for i in range(k))`.

Should this be stated in the documentation?

In the current implementation, squarefree divisors of `n` are
yielded in increasing order exactly when each prime divisor of `n`
is greater than the product of the smaller prime divisors of `n`.
