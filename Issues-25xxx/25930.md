For now I'm steel working on having a first correct base, I've chosen the H basis, but I'm confronted to some complexity issues that I think is due to the convertions into `PackedWords`...
I have a lot of comments in french but the main problem is that in this version there is this test 

```
sage: t0 = time.time(); m4HQ = matr_chgmt_base_osp(H,Q,4); print time.time() - t0; m4QH = matr_chgm
....: t_base_osp(Q,H,4); print time.time() - t0
16.4242839813
51.6398468018
```
and in my personel version where I've impleted WQSym on `Packed Words` I have these times :

```
sage: t0 = time.time(); m4HQ = matr_chgmt_base_pw(GL,L,4); print
....:  time.time() - t0; m4QH = matr_chgmt_base_pw(L,GL,4); prin
....: t time.time() - t0
6.23473000526
13.2976300716
```

I do not really know how to get around the problem...

I thought my method was cached but you are right, it was only this... Thank you for suggesting it!
Do you think this solution of `new_rank` is a good solution ?

I thought it was a great idea! Yet, it didn't give you much speedup? 
In your original code (implemented with packed words), do you have the change of basis method cached or not?

Perhaps it would be good to use `%prun` or `runsnake` to see where most of the time is being spent? ([Profiling](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/profiling.html))
