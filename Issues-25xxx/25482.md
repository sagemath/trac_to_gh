For example, the following test fails:

```
sage -t src/sage/parallel/decorate.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/parallel/decorate.py", line 564, in sage.parallel.decorate.fork
Failed example:
    print("this works"); g()
Expected:
    this works...
    <BLANKLINE>
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unhandled SIG...
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    'NO DATA'
Got:
    this works
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    'NO DATA'
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  18 in sage.parallel.decorate.fork
    [90 tests, 1 failure, 31.67 s]
```

This is due to https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/83 which is fixed in Cysignals.  I tested that an update Cysignals fixed the test.  So we just need to make sure to release a new Cysignals and update Sage to it for 8.3.

I wouldn't really consider this a duplicate.  This issue is not identical with the fix in this case.  But whatever, it's not too important.
