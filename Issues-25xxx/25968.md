Since a fix for #25790 hasn't emerged in time for the release, we should at least mark the failure as known.

This change is intended for the 8.3 release. If it is not applied, users might

- expect this to work
- experience test failures
- spend time debugging this
- report this repeatedly

Since it only disables one doctest, it cannot cause any new failures.

I don't want to start another process discussion here, but for the record:

I think it would be a better policy in these cases to first notify those involved in the ticket ("I don't think this should block the release"). Then give it at least a day for discussion. If agreement can't be reached, bring it to a vote on sage-devel.

It used to reliably happen on my NixOS (linux) laptop. At the same time it wouldn't happen on my desktop with the exact same dependencies and in the same sandbox.

I just tried reproducing it with 8.4.beta6 on my laptop and I cannot. So maybe it is fixed, maybe the conditions triggering it have changed a bit.
