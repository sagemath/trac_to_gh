It used to reliably happen on my NixOS (linux) laptop. At the same time it wouldn't happen on my desktop with the exact same dependencies and in the same sandbox.

I just tried reproducing it with 8.4.beta6 on my laptop and I cannot. So maybe it is fixed, maybe the conditions triggering it have changed a bit.
