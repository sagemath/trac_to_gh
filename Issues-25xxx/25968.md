This change is intended for the 8.3 release. If it is not applied, users might

- expect this to work
- experience test failures
- spend time debugging this
- report this repeatedly

Since it only disables one doctest, it cannot cause any new failures.

I don't want to start another process discussion here, but for the record:

I think it would be a better policy in these cases to first notify those involved in the ticket ("I don't think this should block the release"). Then give it at least a day for discussion. If agreement can't be reached, bring it to a vote on sage-devel.

It used to reliably happen on my NixOS (linux) laptop. At the same time it wouldn't happen on my desktop with the exact same dependencies and in the same sandbox.

I just tried reproducing it with 8.4.beta6 on my laptop and I cannot. So maybe it is fixed, maybe the conditions triggering it have changed a bit.
