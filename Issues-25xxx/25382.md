I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

> Maybe an intermediate thing to being an optional package (which is very bad for the kind of end users who would need sagenb!)


Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

> would be to formally change the default interface to being Jupyter, with VERY clear instructions for how to continue conversion after that point sprinkled everywhere.


I agree.

There is probably a way to script it but it's just no one really want to take that job. I may have to do it for them at some point but that will be a tough sell.

    "body": "<a id='comment:28'></a>\nSo, you can define tags in reST which Sphinx will then pay attention to, for example\n\n```\n.. only:: my-tag\n\n    stuff\n```\nThen if you run Sphinx with the option `-t my-tag`, `stuff` is included in the document. My first approach was to have tags `Python2` and `Python3` and run Sphinx with the corresponding `-t Python[2|3]`. Unfortunately, the text in `stuff` seems to be read even if the tag is not active, so any references to, for example, `reference/notebook` eventually lead to problems with Python3.\n\nThe only way I can think to get around this is to have two different `index.rst` files, one for use with each version of Python, and then create a symlink to the appropriate one when building the docs.

So, you can define tags in reST which Sphinx will then pay attention to, for example

```
.. only:: my-tag

    stuff
```
Then if you run Sphinx with the option `-t my-tag`, `stuff` is included in the document. My first approach was to have tags `Python2` and `Python3` and run Sphinx with the corresponding `-t Python[2|3]`. Unfortunately, the text in `stuff` seems to be read even if the tag is not active, so any references to, for example, `reference/notebook` eventually lead to problems with Python3.

Looks good to me. I'll modify https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/README.rst
to point to SAGELOCAL/share/doc/sagenb as the location for docs.

We should also find a way to put it up to doc.sagemath.org, but this is also not for this ticket.

This is however not at all reflected in the reference manual. I'm not sure how to achieve this with sphinx. By relative paths, like `../../` ?
