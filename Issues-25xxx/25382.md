Just to give proper credit: Volker started that project and did most of the work. It's true that I also worked on it in order to make it the default interface, fixing various bugs and adding the "run SageNB" option.

I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

> would be to formally change the default interface to being Jupyter, with VERY clear instructions for how to continue conversion after that point sprinkled everywhere.

I agree.

I think that the decision of whether to remove the docs for SageNB in Python 2 belongs on sage-devel, not here. There is also the larger question of whether SageNB should be (or is?) officially deprecated. That also belongs on sage-devel. I don't think the few participants on this ticket should be making such policy decisions on our own.
