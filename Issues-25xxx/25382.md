I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

> would be to formally change the default interface to being Jupyter, with VERY clear instructions for how to continue conversion after that point sprinkled everywhere.


I agree.

sagenb docs are installed in SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/, among with many others.

This is however not at all reflected in the reference manual. I'm not sure how to achieve this with sphinx. By relative paths, like `../../` ?
