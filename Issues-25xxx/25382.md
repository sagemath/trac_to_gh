Just to give proper credit: Volker started that project and did most of the work. It's true that I also worked on it in order to make it the default interface, fixing various bugs and adding the "run SageNB" option.

I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

> Maybe an intermediate thing to being an optional package (which is very bad for the kind of end users who would need sagenb!)

Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

> would be to formally change the default interface to being Jupyter, with VERY clear instructions for how to continue conversion after that point sprinkled everywhere.

I agree.

What @kiwifb said was exactly the point I was also trying to make. sagenb is very much deprecated (as in no new features, minimal support, referred to as `legacy` in the docs) but still supported for now. #25837 discusses the future status of that.

But independently of that, I don't see why sagenb has special status. We don't include the docs of other dependencies either. We could just explain the user where he can find the docs of sagenb, which are shipped separately (as part of sagenb).
