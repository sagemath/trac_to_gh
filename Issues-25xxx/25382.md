Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A13):
> I don't think that anyone would be having it come up by default, the default is Jeroen's converter and pretty soon most people's default ends up the Jupyter.

I think that is even more of a reason to work towards making sagenb optional.

> Maybe an intermediate thing to being an optional package (which is very bad for the kind of end users who would need sagenb!)

Are we sure there even are users that keep up with the latest version of sage (e.g. aren't using 6.0 forever or something) *and* still use sagenb? And even making sagenb optional wouldn't immediately make that impossible, it would just make it a tiny bit more inconvenient. That might be a good thing because then they might either complain here (showing us that there are such users) or realize that it might be time to look into the jupyter notebook.

> would be to formally change the default interface to being Jupyter, with VERY clear instructions for how to continue conversion after that point sprinkled everywhere.

I agree.

I think that the decision of whether to remove the docs for SageNB in Python 2 belongs on sage-devel, not here. There is also the larger question of whether SageNB should be (or is?) officially deprecated. That also belongs on sage-devel. I don't think the few participants on this ticket should be making such policy decisions on our own.
