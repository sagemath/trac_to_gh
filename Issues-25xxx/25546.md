The Sage Jupyter kernel is unconditionally installed in `sys.prefix`. However, this should instead be the `install_data` directory. This defaults to the installation prefix, which in turn defaults to `sys.prefix`. So the default won't change, but it allows customization.

The reason for choosing `install_data` is to be compatible with other Jupyter packages, which use the `data_files` option to `setup()` for installing Jupyter files (see for example https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/widgetsnbextension/setup.py#L203).
Those files are installed in the `install_data` directory.

I can't even find the default value of that variable by grepping through the distutils source. However as long as it is relative to `--prefix`, thats fine by me and should solve #25328.
