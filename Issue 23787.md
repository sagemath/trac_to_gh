This is a meta-ticket for tickets that address updating other packages to use the helper functions in `sage-dist-helpers` where possible.  There are
a few advantages to doing this:

* In general it simplifies these scripts and reduces a lot of boilerplate.  As more functions get written even more boilerplate can be removed, but even the existing functions help a lot.
* Although this requires irritating bulk updates to packages now, it reduces the overall need for such bulk updates in the future, since many packages that have similar build and installation steps can be be updated at once by updates to the applicable helper functions.

The second bullet point is especially motivated right now by #22509.  Since it requires updates to nearly every package in Sage anyways, it makes more sense to update most packages to use the helper functions, and then add `DESTDIR` support through the helper functions.  In particular, the vast majority of Python and autotools packages can be given `DESTDIR` support en masse by this approach.

Note that for #22509 there will have be a second round of updates to DESTDIR support for some packages that manually copy files to locations in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  However, making these updates first still significantly reduces that number of packages that will require additional treatment.

Replying to [comment:8 jdemeyer]:
> cysignals should be easy... it is only unusual because it uses autoconf in a Python package but `sdh_configure` should just work anyway.

Indeed.  Most of them *are* easy and are already done in my old branch for this.  The only reason many of these packages were separated out from #24025 is that they required one or two more other changes.
