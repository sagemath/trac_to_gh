# Issue 15907: Transducer.cartesian_product: additional example (11 blocks minus 10 blocks)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16144

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-04-12 04:47:40

CC:  dkrenn skropf

Keywords: finite_state_machine

In order to illustrate the use of the version of `Transducer.cartesian_product` introduced in #16016 combined with the common transducers introduced in #16142, I added an additional example to the docstring of `Transducer.cartesian_product`. It computes the number of 11 blocks minus the number of 10 blocks over the alphabet [0, 1].
