I noticed a few remaining typos in the diff:

Grammatical error in src/sage/algebras/free_zinbiel_algebra.py:

```python
`@``@` -95,7 +95,7 `@``@` class FreeZinbielAlgebra(CombinatorialFreeModule):
     .. WARNING::
 
         Currently the basis is indexed by all words over the variables,
         including the empty word. This is a slight abuse as it is suppose
         to be the indexed by all non-empty words.
```


replace "it is suppose to be the indexed by" with "it is supposed to be indexed by"


A typo in src/sage/combinat/integer_vectors_mod_permgroup.py:

```python
`@``@` -523,7 +523,7 `@``@` class IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup_All(UniqueRepresentation, SearchForest):
         r"""
         Element class for the set of integer vectors of given sum enumerated modulo
         the action of a permutation group. These vector are clonable lists of integers
         which must check conditions coming form the parent appearing in the method
         :meth:`~sage.structure.list_clone.ClonableIntArray.check`.
```


replace "These vector" with "These vectors", "must check conditions coming form" with "must satisfy conditions coming from"; and similar changes in `IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup_with_constraints`.

done. I allow myself to set this back to positive. You can add your real name as a reviewer if you want.

There's still a grammatical error in `free_zinbiel_algebra.py`; replace "to be the indexed by" with "to be indexed by". (Feel free to set to positive_review afterwards)
