# Issue 27803: SageMath docker image long to start because of initialization

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28040

Each time the docker image is launched in a container, [SageMath](SageMath) creates .pyc files for each file in the sagemath library and perform some copy. It takes a serious amount of time (~10 secs). Could it be possible for this preprocessing to be made in the image? In other word, run [SageMath](SageMath) once in the build process.

Though, as answered in [issue #35 on sagemath/docker-images](https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images/issues/35) this might not be a good idea (bigger image).
