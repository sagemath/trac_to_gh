This looks okay to me. Any reason to worry about using `__repr__` to define the hash? Is there a better option here?

I'll mark it as positive review, and anyone who objects can change it back.

I think a better value to use for hashing is something like: `(self.__class__, self._prec)` since that's closer to, for example, how the object would be reduced for pickling.

Well I didn't *make* you do it, but I think it makes more sense this way.
