This looks okay to me. Any reason to worry about using `__repr__` to define the hash? Is there a better option here?

I'll mark it as positive review, and anyone who objects can change it back.

I think a better value to use for hashing is something like: `(self.__class__, self._prec)` since that's closer to, for example, how the object would be reduced for pickling.

Here it is. The 32-bit hash needs to be checked. I just took the 64-bit hash mod `2**32`.

Hmm... just an aside, I didn't realize the doctester had a way to specify different results for 64-bit vs 32-bit.  It would be good to have other platform specifiers too, or perhaps general support for platform markers https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers

That said, I don't know if it makes enormous sense to test the hash value, since the details of how specific objects are hashed in Python is implementation-specific and can change between Python versions and generally isn't guaranteed.  Instead, I would just test that `hash()` of two instances compares equal when it should.

Raah, you made me change the hash, and now the new hash does not make sense.. Can I set it back to use `_repr_` ?

Well I didn't _make_ you do it, but I think it makes more sense this way.  In any case the actual numerical hash value is completely implementation and system dependent and shouldn't be tested unless you're actually testing the hash algorithm itself.  Instead just ensure that two immutable(?) instances of the same class have the same hash--which it seems you did.
