# Issue 20486: Clean up "kwds" use in sage/homology

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2016-05-30 21:24:33

CC:  tscrim

Goal: replace

```
def f(blah, **kwds):
```

with

```
def f(blah, kwd1=x, kwd2=y, ...):
```

There are many uses of the former in `sage/homology`, and they make it confusing as to which keywords are passed to subroutines, and they also make it hard to catch typos (`X.homology(algorith='auto')`, for example).
