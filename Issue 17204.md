CC:  @bhutz

If a SchemeMorphism_polynomial is defined with fraction field elements, change ring fails; in that case, change_ring should be called on the numerator and denominator:


```
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(QQ,2)
H=Hom(A,A)
f=H([3*x^2/y,y^2/x])
f.change_ring(RR)
```

This looks good except for one minor thing. In the code you have


```
if isinstance(f,FractionFieldElement) == True
```


Make this


```
if isinstance(f, FractionFieldElement):
```
