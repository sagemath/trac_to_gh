True, and building gp2c should also fail since we don't know where pari.cfg is. Like the comment says, "If we can't find pari.cfg, gp2c isn't going to work."

What was the original `./configure` command, and what did it output? What does it output after the message was changed to a warning? Something is fishy.

Ok, there are two things weird:

1. Why is it trying to install the (optional) gp2c package when you haven't enabled it with `--enable-gp2c`?
2. Why can't it find your system `pari.cfg`?

The real problem is the first item... but, I'm curious. Your config log shows...


```
configure:17361: checking for gp
configure:17379: found /bin/gp
```


Is that really where `gp` lives, or is it a symlink to `/usr/bin/gp`? Perhaps `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`? We use that path when guessing the location of `pari.cfg`, so having it return `/bin/gp` instead of `/usr/bin/gp` would throw a wrench into things. It's an easy fix however.

(But regardless, you haven't enabled gp2c at all, so you shouldn't be hitting this problem.)
