Thanks for doing this Nathann. My first commit fixes the failing doctests and give a reason why I wanted this constructor. The other commit is an attempt by me to make the `[V, E]` constructor better differentiate between the list of edges input. If you disagree with it, feel free to just revert back to the first commit and set a positive review.

No, sorry. No linear-time test to detect an input format.

Scuse me, that's actually quadratic. Just no.
