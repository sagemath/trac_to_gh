# Issue 20833: comparison with wildcard raises error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21070

```
sage: w = SR.wild()
sage: {a*w+b: 0 for a in [1, 2] for b in [1, 2]}
```

results in a TypeError

```
...
TypeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```


This seems to be a problem with comparison as:

```
sage: w = SR.wild()
sage: bool(w == 1)
```

results in the same error.

Up to now noone thought about what happens if wildcards are compared. That Python's `dictcomp` calls `Expression.__nonzero__` is problematic is nothing, new but it was just a performance problem. Now we need to make sure in the Maxima interface that no wildcards slip through.

Better still, in `__nonzero__` check early for wildcards in equations and use `(lhs-rhs).is_trivial_zero()`.
