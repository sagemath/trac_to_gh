Keywords: quiet

In a fresh git clone of Sage 9.2.beta6, `./configure -q`
printed two lines to stdout and one to stderr.

```
$ ./configure -q
11.4.3
1.5.3
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```


To figure out where these come from, I ran `./configure`
in non-quiet mode, redirecting stdout to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-output.txt
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```

and again, redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-output.txt
$
```


The corresponding lines when running without `-q` seem to be:

```
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG ntl...
...
checking NTL version >= 10.3... 11.4.3
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG mpfi...
...
checking MPFI version >= 1.5... 1.5.3
...
checking for the package system in use... (ignoring conda
because no environment is active) homebrew
...
```

The `(ignoring conda ...)` part seems to go to stderr instead of stdout.

I did not know to run `./bootstrap` and don't know much about it.

I thought `./bootstrap` was automatically run by `./configure`.

I guess that is what happens on a fresh clone.

Now I realise `make distclean` does not clean all the way to the fresh clone state.

Thanks to your hint I now ran the following and quiet mode works!

```
$ ./bootstrap

`configure` does not run it, but `make` runs it when the `configure` script does not exist or is older than its sources files (`configure.ac` and various stuff in `m4`, `build/pkgs`).

In that case, we could send them directly to `AS_MESSAGE_FD` or `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` instead of passing through `stderr`?

Yes, all messages that should be shown to the user need to be sent to `AS_MESSAGE_FD`. That's what all the autoconf macros for printing do.

`AC_RUN_IFELSE` redirects stderr to `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD`. This is how compiler warnings/errors end up in `config.log`. I have the test program print to stderr for this reason. Neither compilers nor test programs have any business of printing to stdout. `AC_RUN_IFELSE` does not redirect stdout.

No, I want it to go the log, not to the terminal: At the terminal, only "yes" or "no" is needed. The user will need the detail of what specific version was found (and determined to be insufficient) only for diagnostic purposes; hence, the log. So `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD`, not `AS_MESSAGE_FD`.

I was thinking of


```
fprintf((FILE*)]]AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD[[,...
```


but now that I've tried it, it was nonsense to begin with. The file descriptor from the parent shell is meaningless in the newly-compiled program, and we don't have a way to append `>&AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` to the command-line. So everything's fine here.

That's right.

Glad to clear this up!

On Debian 10 "buster" I observed one more such "leak" when

```
checking whether we have a properly patched Symmetrica version... 
```

which outputs blocks of size 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 looking like

```
[1:0:0]
[1:1:0]
[1:2:1]
```

Fix that here or in a follow-up ticket?

The file `build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-configure.m4` is not similar
enough to the NTL and MPFI ones that I can figure out a fix.
In passing, its indentation mixes tabs and spaces.

the output is done by symmetrica's function `println()`. A hopefully suitable replacement is called `fprintln()` - I never tried it, but you're welcome to dig up the docs on it and try.

Thanks Dima, I tried and indeed, on top of previous changes on this ticket, changing line 18 of file `build/pkgs/symmetrica/spkg-configure.m4` as follows

```
-            [println(b);]
+            [fprintln(stderr, b);]
```

does the trick. Should I push a commit here or in a new ticket depending on this one?

A new ticket with the branch based on this one is better.
