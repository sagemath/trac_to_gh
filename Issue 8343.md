While working on #7630, I discovered that even if a user has confirmed an email address, if the user changes it on the Account Settings page, the new address is marked as "confirmed" even though no re-confirmation email is sent out.

I don't know if we want to re-send confirmation emails every time a user changes their email address, but at least we should mark the address as unconfirmed.
