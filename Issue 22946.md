Like we do for `PowerSeriesRing_generic`. There will also be some other cleanup on the file to better handle inputs.

This code doesn't seem like it has been touched in a long time. I cleaned up the `laurent_series_ring.py` and I started to do for the element and realized there was so much there that needed work. I had to stop for today and go do math. If you want to do more cleanup, go ahead, or want me to do more, just let me know.
