# Issue 13077: lrs_volume is broken by polyedral refactoring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13249

Original creator: mhampton

Original creation time: 2012-07-13 16:28:14

Assignee: mhampton

CC:  vbraun

Keywords: polyhedra, lrs_volume, geometry

The recent changes to the geometry/polyhedra module broke support for the lrs_volume() method of the Polyhedron class.  This is not tested usually because it relies on the lrs optional package.  The fix is very simple, just a couple of imports needed to be added.

We came across this exact issue today when exploring the polyhedra functionality in Sage at Sage Days 45. And we came up with the same fix, except that we put the import statements directly in the `lrs_volume` method.

Sounds good. Can you include a commit message? Just edit the patch with a text editor...

I've added the commit message to Frank's patch. I think thats the version to go with since its less global imports. I'm giving positive review to his patch. If one of you guys could review mine then we can ship it...

I have made a small review patch, including a clean up of the unused or missing import statements (found using pyflakes)

If you are happy with my review patch, and when the bot turns green again, you can set a positive review
