I rebased, since in the examples I had added a different `some_elements` method, this triggered an error in `_test_jacobi` where it was not checked if an element was zero in the super case. A fix for this is also added.

I think this is good. I actually didn't know Sage's doc automatically handled the alignment (I thought it needed a `\begin{aligned}`).

Just add your name to the authors and you can set a positive review.
