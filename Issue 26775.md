Keywords: function field

This ticket enhances the new function field code (Trac #22982) to add a construction functor and support the `construction` method:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: K.construction()
(FunctionField
 Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)

sage: from sage.rings.function_field.function_field import FunctionFieldFunctor
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: FunctionFieldFunctor()(Frac(R))
Rational function field in x over Rational Field
```

Don't think this needs 22892 as a dependency; it seems to commit fine with `8.5` as a base.

I'm not sure where `FunctionFieldFunctor` should go.  Right now, it's in `function_field.py` in the `src/sage/rings/function_field` directory.

Perhaps we should add a new file in that directory called `functors.py`?  There's going to be at least one more `ConstructionFunctor` in the function field code, for constructing spaces of differentials.

While your patch looks sensible to me, that's not how things currently work for number fields. Instead, number fields are constructed directly from their base field by an `AlgebraicConstructionFunctor`. Can you explain why you are deviating from that model? (This may be a stupid question, I basically don't know anything about function fields.) And if your approach is better, should we use it from number fields too?

Also, you may want to add a couple of example of new coercions discovered thanks to the new construction, if there are any.

I don't know if it's any better this way.

Well, the coercions I wanted it to discover, it couldn't, so I ended up coding them by hand (Trac #26993).  I created this ticket because I didn't want to just throw this code away, but I don't know if it does anything useful.
