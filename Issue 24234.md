The `OptionalExtension` mechanism (see `src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py`) allows for Cython modules to be cythonized but not compiled by distutils (by some logic in the `sage_build_ext` build command).

Instead of just skipping the build of those extensions, they should really never be added to `ext_modules` in the first place. This affects `clean_install_dir` because optional-but-non-built extensions should not be importable.

Makes sense to me.  It might be nice to have a test for this but that would involve adding more tests for `sage_setup` in general--something I know we've been meaning to do for a while.

The problem is that it's not really possible to test `sage_setup` without `setup.py`. So that would require that most logic of `setup.py` would be moved to the `sage_setup` module such that it can be imported for testing. I agree that this makes sense, but not for this ticket.
