# Issue 10521: implicit multiplication setting should be added to the FAQ

This is a frequently requested feature that is not at all obvious, so it should be in the FAQ.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This is already said at https://wiki.sagemath.org/sage_mathematica. I suggest that we close this as wontfix, so that FAQ will not be too long.

I disagree; I think this feature should be some place a bit more prominent.

Hmm... OK. Can we doctest this? Currently this just gives `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

I would do something similar to the docstring of `implicit_multiplication`:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: preparse('2x')
'Integer(2)*x'
sage: implicit_multiplication(False)
sage: preparse('2x')
'2x'
```

with perhaps some very mild explanation about preparse.

Not nice. But here it is.

Your docstring and doctest do not match.

After thinking a while I think this is best to left untested to get better documentation.

I think you should at least do a little bit of explanation that it is preparsing the input (especially if there ends up being some strange syntax error message when someone uses this in some perverse way).

Comment by jmantysalo created at 2017-02-10 15:59:05

Hmm... Something like "This is done in the preparser. It may not work in all complicated situations."?

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-02-10 20:38:47

How about "This is preparsed by Sage into Python code. It may not work in a complicated situation."?

Sounds good, changed.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-02-11 15:21:33

Two things. The first I think we should give an example of the preparsing. The second, and more important, is to turn back off implicit multiplication.

Like this?

IMO the right solution is to have support for `implicit_multiplication(True)` in the testing framework.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-02-15 15:22:01

Yep, that looks good. Thank you.

I'm actually somewhat surprised that it did result in an error in the doctest framework since that does run the preparser... *shrugs*
