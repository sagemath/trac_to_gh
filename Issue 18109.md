This ticket addresses the following problem:

    In the `CGraph` backends, three `cdef` functions are used all the time to
    deal with vertex labels, i.e. `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`,
`check_vertex`. They are always called with the same arguments, which are
    all attributes of the backend that calls it. They should be method, so that
    the arguments are not needlessly repeated.

What this branch does:

- The `CGraph` backends (i.e. `SparseBackend`, `DenseBackend` and
  `StaticSparseGraph`) and `GenericGraphBackend` are turned into cdef classes.

- The three functions `get_vertex`, `vertex_label`, `check_vertex` become
  methods of `CGraphBackend`

- It adds a method `CGraphBackend.c_graph()` to get the two cdef attributes
  `_cg` and `_cg_rev`. Turns out that some code in Sage accesses directly
  `G._backend._cg`.

This should have been sufficient, but there were (unexpected) consequences:

- There is no automatic pickling for cdef classes (as instrospection does not
  work), and the doctests do not pass if that does not work. Consequently, I
  implemented a unique `__reduce__` function in `GenericGraphBackend` which
  handles the pickling for all backends (sparse/dense/static/networkx). It also
  removes some duplicated code as a result.

This makes the code a bit clearer (and it is needed). Also, moving this pickling
function above is good for the future, for there will be many modifications in
the future to the data structures in Sage: I plan to merge `CGraph` and
`GenericBackend` into only one class (but that's for later).

Hello,

1. Would it be bad to access directly the `._cg` or `._cg_rev` attributes? (ok it seems to be for python code)

2. Is there a description somewhere of the attributes `vertex_ints` and `vertex_labels`?

3. In a cython file, there is no need to declare `cdef object x` or `object x`, just do `x`.

Hello,

> 1. Would it be bad to access directly the `._cg` or `._cg_rev` attributes? (ok it seems to be for python code)


I do not think that it is if you do not modify them. Some functions (like isomorphism test) use it directly. The guy who wrote the code that does that knew what he was doing, unfortunately he is the only one `:-P`

> 2. Is there a description somewhere of the attributes `vertex_ints` and `vertex_labels`?


Not that I know. I am not sure that I remember exactly what they do either. What I remember is that not all vertices have an associated label, so that you don't spend your time playing with a dictionary when your graph is defined over integers.

This being said, I plan to rewrite all this (and of course the new code will have a proper documentation). I spent several hours thinking of how this should all be done, and my hardest constraint was that the changes should be "reviewable". Which is not very easily achieved when you plan to merge two classes together `:-P`

The 'first step' was #18185, the second is this one (or #18317, but that's only doc). Then I will turn NetworkX backend into a CGraph, and deprecate a lot of things in there. And then... Merge the classes `O_O;;`

> 3. In a cython file, there is no need to declare `cdef object x` or `object x`, just do `x`.


Okay. Well, I don't think I did anything like that but I may have met such a line somewhere. Really, this does not matter for the moment: this code will be heavily rewritten.

Actually you do since `get_vertex` or `vertex_label` are intensively used everywhere. And those methods do check if their argument belongs to some dictionary as a first step! But if I understand well, the aim of the ticket is precisely **not** to upgrade these two methods but just to move them.

Hum

```diff
+ cdef int get_vertex(self, object u) except ? -2
+ cdef object vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```
this would better be

```diff
cdef int get_vertex(self, u) except ? -2
cdef vertex_label(self, int u_int)
```

The aim of this ticket is to merge CGraph and Backend together. All that "backend" does is forward everything to CGraph. But I certainly cannot do all of this at once, it would be impossible to review. Plus because of the problems I met when writing this branch, I know that I should be wary of the isomorphism test code which works at a lower level than I expected.

Well, if you can turn it into an independent function in some other module (something integer-related) then no problem. This code is much more in need of clarity than nanoseconds at the moment `:-P`

The proper solution to "convert" a Python object `u` into a long is

```
cdef long u_long = PyNumber_Index(u)
```
