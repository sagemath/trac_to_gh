There is a series of "with_" commands that do row operations on a matrix and return a new matrix.  The set looks complete, except row and column swapping seems to be missing.  Patch adds them in.

Thanks, Alain!  I'm about to build a constructor to create elementary matrices, so I've been hoping this would go in soon.
