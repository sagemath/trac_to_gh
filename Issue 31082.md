Keywords: Partitions

Creating the integer partitions of an integer N with parts restricted to a list L takes much longer than creating the weighted integer vectors of N with weights in L. In principle one should be able to translate between these two constructions, so perhaps it would be better to compute Partitions(N, parts_in = L) by calling WeightedIntegerVectors(N, L) and then transferring the results accordingly? Below are two examples where this manifests:

This code sees how far Sage can compute in 100 seconds with respect to both functions:

```
import time
a = time.time()
i = 0
L = []
while time.time()-a < 100:
    i+=1
    L.append(len(WeightedIntegerVectors(i,[1000,1001])))
print(len(L))
######################################
a = time.time()
i = 0
L = []
while time.time()-a < 100:
    i+=1
    L.append(len(Partitions(i,parts_in = [1000,1001])))
print(len(L))
```

The result of the first block is 321269, whereas the second is 41686 (for me).

Another example: this code computes the Frobenius number of [1000,1001] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem) by starting at the naive upper bound and working downwards: 



```
import time
a = time.time()
for i in range(1000*1001, 0, -1):
    if any(_ for _ in WeightedIntegerVectors(i, parts_in = [1000,1001])):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
        break

###################################
a = time.time()
for i in range(1000*1001, 0, -1):
    if any(_ for _ in Partitions(i, parts_in = [1000,1001])):
        pass
    else:
        print(i)
        break
```



The first code block runs in 0.8315746784210205 seconds whereas the second takes 249.9559507369995 seconds to evaluate (for me).

A very basic attempt at a fix for this would be something like 

```
def PartitionPartsIn(N, L):
    sortL = sorted(L, reverse=True)
    for wIV in WeightedIntegerVectors(N,sortL):
        a = []
        for i in range(len(sortL)):
            a+=[sortL[i]]*wIV[i]
        yield(a)
```

Of course this would have to be adapted into the Partitions class, but it seems like that should be no issue as long as the parts_in flag is taken into account. Even this crude fix gives me much better performance on the two tasks above.

You can make this even faster by using the `iterator_fast` function in `integer_vector_weighted.py`. That way you don't have an additional transient element, just lists being returned. So I would do it like this:

```python
        from sage.combinat.integer_vector_weighted import iterator_fast
        sorted_parts = sorted(parts, reverse=True)
        for vec in iterator_fast(n, sorted_parts):
            yield sum([pi] *  multi for pi, multi in zip(sorted_parts, vec), []
```

This should be the fastest way to do things.

This probably can be easily modified to work for k-regular/restricted partitions as well, but that can be a separate ticket.
