Needs the following change:


```diff
diff --git a/src/bin/sage-coverage b/src/bin/sage-coverage
index fba827328f..80b3b0eca6 100755
--- a/src/bin/sage-coverage

     if not args.filename:
         coverage_all(os.path.join(os.environ["SAGE_SRC"], 'sage'))
     elif len(args.filename) == 1:
-        coverage_all(args.filename)
+        coverage_all(args.filename[0])
     else:
         print("sage-coverage: error: --all only accepts one filename argument")
         sys.exit(1)
```


because `args.filename` is a list and then `sage --coverage --all src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does not work anymore.

Once done, you can put this on positive review on my behalf.
