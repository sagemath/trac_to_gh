```
$ mkdir "path with whitespace"
$ touch "path with whitespace"/xyz.py
$ tox -e doctest -- "path with whitespace"
doctest run-test: commands[0] | tox -c /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/src/tox.ini -e doctest -- 'path with whitespace'
doctest run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='1503375210'
doctest run-test: commands[0] | sh -c '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/src/../sage -t -p 0 ../path' with whitespace
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

Also `sage -startuptime` seems to get in an infinite loop when receiving a filename containing spaces

Needs the following change:


```diff
diff --git a/src/bin/sage-coverage b/src/bin/sage-coverage
index fba827328f..80b3b0eca6 100755
--- a/src/bin/sage-coverage
+++ b/src/bin/sage-coverage
@@ -60,7 +60,7 @@ if args.all:
     if not args.filename:
         coverage_all(os.path.join(os.environ["SAGE_SRC"], 'sage'))
     elif len(args.filename) == 1:
-        coverage_all(args.filename)
+        coverage_all(args.filename[0])
     else:
         print("sage-coverage: error: --all only accepts one filename argument")
         sys.exit(1)
```


because `args.filename` is a list and then `sage --coverage --all src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does not work anymore.

Once done, you can put this on positive review on my behalf.
