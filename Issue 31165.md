Needs the following change:


```diff
diff --git a/src/bin/sage-coverage b/src/bin/sage-coverage
index fba827328f..80b3b0eca6 100755
--- a/src/bin/sage-coverage

     if not args.filename:

     elif len(args.filename) == 1:
-        coverage_all(args.filename)

     else:

because `args.filename` is a list and then `sage --coverage --all src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does not work anymore.

Once done, you can put this on positive review on my behalf.
