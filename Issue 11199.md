The (English) knapsack documentation in the thematic tutorial for MILP has an "oops" moment.

```
p.add_constraint(sum(weight[o] * taken[o] for o in L) <= C)
```

does not have the correct corresponding typeset thing, which instead has the sum of usefulness times taken less than or equal to C.  

Perhaps this was introduced in the translation process?  Anyway, should be easy to fix.

That's perfectly right `^^;`

The typeset version of the LP did not even depends on the weights....Fixed !

And there was also a variable named "divers" which I guess does not mean anything outside of french ... Thanks ! `:-)`

Don't worry about the divers; in English, it's an old spelling of "diverse", or various - presumably from the time that Old/Middle French was busy turning Anglo-Saxon into Middle English... :)

Then, do you think I should turn it back to "divers", is "random_stuff_" better or worse to an english tongue ? `:-)`

No, random stuff is definitely better than 'divers'!  Just sayin' that it was at least plausible to a sufficiently well-read English speaker.
