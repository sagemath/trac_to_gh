The bundle coerce_7 contains patches 1-5 (but not 6 yet), as well as all previous work.

Rather than posting bundles and patches, it will be easier to push and pull from http://sagemath.org/coercion/hgwebdir.cgi/sage-coerce/ based on Sage 2.10.1. I can set enable push for anyone who wants it.

The repository has moved to http://cython.org/coercion/hgwebdir.cgi/sage-coerce/ (I was having difficulty pushing to the repo when it was directly under sagemath.org)

The latest repo is at 

http://cython.org/coercion/hgwebdir.cgi/sage-coerce-3.0.3/

and based on the 3.0.3 release.

Cheers,

Michael

I am closing this ticket as wontfix since the coercion rewrite is being merged piece by piece.

Cheers,
