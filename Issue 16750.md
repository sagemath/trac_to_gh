Needs some rebase.

Couldn't you split this in two tickets?
 1. new spkg with interface
 2. new features to schemes
Would be easier to review.

Is there a link with Chow by C. Sorger

Maybe we could open a ticket for the integration of Chow ? After contacting the authors, of course.
I think I had a preliminary contact with Sorger before he got his current important official duties.

I have split the database part (available as branch public/16987-database).

But the database link in the ticket description is not longer valid. Volker, could you please update it ?

I don't have the tarball any more.

But http://boxen.math.washington.edu/ still exists. Are you sure that your home directory there has been destroyed ?
