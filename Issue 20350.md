A dependency for #20564 had been added to the ticket. I have removed this because, as far as I am aware, this ticket is independent of #20564.

I thought I had seen something that would have conflicted with #20564 (although it might still have some conflict, but that's now trivial). However, you have (likely inadvertently) based this off #20618, so I think it would be a good idea to separate those out rather than make #20618 a dependency.

Damn! It looks like I have somehow hooked #20618 into my version of the develop branch. Will have to figure out how to get rid of it...

I would create a new branch and then use `git cherry-pick` to merge in the non-trivial commits.

Would you like me to do it?

The last commit was to remove trac:20618, which I mistakenly added to the ticket

I've made my way through most of this ticket in some detail, but there are a number of issues.

- The first is that the `degree` and `p_Degree` methods need better documentation. I tried to change it to what I interpreted them as, but I realized I have no idea what it should say.
- There are a number of places with incorrectly formatting docstrings, such as the first sentence not being "short"/"one-line", a few run-on sentences, and unclear `INPUT:` blocks.

However, the code looks good; so getting this finalized is just a matter of putting on some polish.

Thanks Travis! I'll fix these and look through all of the documentation. 

There were some comments on sage-dev about some source files becoming overly large so I was wondering also whether it would be better to put the residue sequence code into its' own file. I think that `StandardTableaux_residue` and `StandardTableaux_residue_shape` need to stay in tableau_tuple but  the other classes could go into a tableau_residue file. On the other hand, tableau_tuple is already quite specialised so perhaps it doesn't matter. What do you think?

I think `tableau_tuple.py` is nowhere near as long as a number of other files, but it would be easier to find documentation/code-wise if it was in a separate file, as well as avoid one import loop between `partition_tuple.py` and `tableau_tuple.py`. So, I think it would be good to move it.

I also realized I did not properly indent the tests I moved into `ResidueSequence.__init__`. Moreover, one other doc note is `blocks` has a partial sentence.

FYI - It looks like you forgot to `git add tableau_residues.py`.

I think that I have addressed all of the problems with the documentation, as a few other things to boot!

Looks good. I just made one more pass through and did some adjustments and fixed a few typos. If my changes are good, you can set a positive review.
