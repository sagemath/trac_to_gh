I've made my way through most of this ticket in some detail, but there are a number of issues.

- The first is that the `degree` and `p_Degree` methods need better documentation. I tried to change it to what I interpreted them as, but I realized I have no idea what it should say.
- There are a number of places with incorrectly formatting docstrings, such as the first sentence not being "short"/"one-line", a few run-on sentences, and unclear `INPUT:` blocks.

However, the code looks good; so getting this finalized is just a matter of putting on some polish.

Thanks Travis! I'll fix these and look through all of the documentation. 

There were some comments on sage-dev about some source files becoming overly large so I was wondering also whether it would be better to put the residue sequence code into its' own file.
