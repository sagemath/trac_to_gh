# Issue 14974: Link p-adics tutoiral from number theory tour

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15211

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2013-09-18 17:36:08

As requested by a user, it would be nice to have a link from `tour_numtheory.html#adic-numbers` to `doc/reference/padics/sage/rings/padics/tutorial.html`.

the link would ideally go to the internal reference manual entry, rather than to URL, IMHO.

I cannot reproduce this. Did you rebuild docs after applying the patch?

re-tested, it works.

Still fails, duh. E.g. http://build.sagedev.org/release/builders/%20%20slow%20AIMS%20%20%28Debian%208%2032%20bit%29%20incremental/builds/450 but really fails on the whole buildbot.

And yes we do `make doc-clean`

oops, indeed. It'd really a bug in sphinx, IMHO, that one needs to clean docs for such an update to go through. Anyway.
