Florent and Jean-Baptiste, 
Can you take a look at this patch and make sure that it will be useful for implementing algebras like PQSym.  Do you have any other feedback?
-Mike

Hello, there seems to be an unused import:

```
sage/combinat/parking_functions.py:73: 'Composition' imported but unused
```

Hello,

you should not use

```
assert isinstance(n, (Integer, int)) and n >= 0, '%s is not a non-negative integer.' % n 
```

but rather write a test that raise a ValueError

Similar problem for all the other assert in your patch

Well, nothing works..

You have made a mistake in changing one of the assert into a test (you forgot to add a *not*)

Please run sage -t to catch the errors, before posting patches here.

Dorota, the new version of your patch does not change the /doc/en/reference/combinat/index.rst file  to insert the line `sage/combinat/parking_functions`.  I think you will need to make this change.

The patch trac_14086-parking-review-mz.patch makes a number of minor changes to the documentation and contains all of the changes from trac_14086-parking-review-fc.patch since it needed to rebased against the lastest version.
