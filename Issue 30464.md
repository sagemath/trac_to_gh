What's the value of `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` at that point? The only way I can reproduce that error is to put something non-empty and non-integer into that variable in the following script:


```/bin/sh

#SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED=""

if [ "${SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED}" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "SUCCESS"
else
  echo "FAILURE"
fi
```


When the variable is empty or `1` (the only legal values?), no error is raised.

`-ne` is for comparing integers. Empty string is not portably an integer expression.

Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]:

Could you reproduce the problem? Since I can't, I just wanted to be sure that `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` isn't somehow winding up with junk in it. If your branch fixes the problem, it's clearly more correct, so feel free to rubber stamp it on my behalf.

I haven't tried to reproduce it. It's clear that this variable is either unset or set to 1. So, one needs to use the correct test.

The change makes sense, but I can't reproduce this on OS X:

```
% echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
% cat junk.sh
export STR1=""

if [ "${STR1}" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "hello"
fi

% source junk.sh
hello
% . ./junk.sh
hello
```

Any ideas how Volker got it?

My guess is through some secret `bootstrap` invocation in an unconfigured source tree.
