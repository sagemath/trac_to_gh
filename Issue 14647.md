This patch fixes a typo in qmu_save. Without it the function does not work whenever the quiver has 0<m!=n frozen vertices.

Hi Salvatore,

thanks for the fix! I'll give it a positive review if you change the header line of your new doctest:


```
Make sure we can save quivers with `m != n` frozen variables
```

to

```
Make sure we can save quivers with `m != n` frozen variables, see :trac:`14851`::
```
