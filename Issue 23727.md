the `substitute` command does not work with `I`:

```
sage: f = sin(x*I)+I*x^2+cos(exp(I))
sage: f.subs(I=0)
I*x^2 + cos(e^I) + sin(I*x)
```

The documentation: `Substitute with keyword arguments (works only with symbols):`. For you `I` is a symbol but for Pynac it's numeric. Just use dictionary or relational syntax:

```
sage: f = sin(x*I)+I*x^2+cos(exp(I))
sage: f
I*x^2 + cos(e^I) + I*sinh(x)
sage: f.subs({I:0})
I*x^2 + cos(1) + I*sinh(x)
sage: f.subs(I==0)
I*x^2 + cos(1) + I*sinh(x)
```

As you can see the `I` inside `cos(e^I)` is now replaced. I agree that the other `I`s not being replaced is a bug. The bug is independent of which numeric is to be substituted:

```
sage: f = sin(x*2)+2*x^2+cos(exp(2))
sage: f
2*x^2 + cos(e^2) + sin(2*x)
sage: f.subs({2:0})
cos(1) + sin(2*x) + 2
```

btw it is strange that you get `I*sinh(x)` since with Sage 8.0 I get `sin(I*x)`, i.e., this term is unchanged.

Why should `(I*x).subs(I=0)` work? This `I` isn't a variable, it's a complex number. Would you expect `(2*x).subs({2:3})` to give `(3*x)`?

Well, `subs` was always about termwise substitution. Maxima does it too:

```
(%i3) subst(%i=y,%i*x);
(%o3)                                 x y
(%i4) subst(2=y,2*x);
(%o4)                                 x y
