If a tarball does not match the checksums, it is silently deleted by `sage -i`. This is very confusing. A warning should be shown prominently. 

We see this over an over again, e.g. on #23898.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23972

First of all, it's not *silently* deleted, there is a message:

```
[zlib-1.2.11] Found local metadata for zlib-1.2.11
[zlib-1.2.11] Invalid checksum for cached file /usr/local/src/sage-config/upstream/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz, deleting
```


I think the auto-deleting was implemented by Volker to make things easier for bots. If a bot has a wrong tarball in `upstream` for some reason, then it's easiest to simply re-download it.

Maybe the best solution would be to only delete the existing tarball when a correct one was successfully downloaded.

I think this solution works: do not *delete* the bad tarball, just ignore it and download a new version replacing the bad version.

If the tarball does exist on the mirrors, the result should be the same as now. If the tarball does *not* exist on the mirrors, it is simply left in place.
