# Issue 16063: upgrade setuptools to 2.2b1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16300

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-05-07 08:58:21

Keywords: setuptools

This is critical for patchbot runs.

Frequently patchbot runs fail, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/7acENsAQeXo . It is probable this was introduced with setuptools-2.0.1 because only those runs based on versions >6.1.1 show this behaviour. Also first tests with 2.2b1 are encouraging, so it seems right to open this upgrade ticket.

This upgrade indeed seems to solve the problem; my patchbot failed more than half of the time before and not at all after making the same changes as in this patch.

Please don't attach tarballs in the future, we'd rather not store binary blobs in the trac database forever.
