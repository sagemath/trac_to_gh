For various reasons, having a method `expansion.exact_part` that returns the asymptotic expansion that consists of all `ExactTermÂ´-summands would be very useful.

This ticket provides such a method.

I'd prefer to copy the expression and to delete all non-exact elements. In general, this should be more efficient than recreating a poset with almost all elements --- after all, in general, there will be more exact terms than error terms.

I agree, this strategy seems to be more efficient than building the entire expansion again. I've adapted the implementation.
