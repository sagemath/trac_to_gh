Keywords: Dirichlet character Gauss sum

In SageMath 6.9.beta2:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(13, K)
sage: chi = G([z^2])
sage: chi.gauss_sum()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce zeta52 into Cyclotomic Field of order 8 and degree 4
```

This arises because `chi` is actually defined over a smaller cyclotomic field.  It can be fixed by letting `gauss_sum()` minimize the base ring.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19060

You are right, done.

I prefer to have the doctest output reflect the actual output (on some system) as closely as possible, and I have never seen `0.0*I` in these tests (of course it would be the ideal answer).
