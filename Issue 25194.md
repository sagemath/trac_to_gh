The patchbots time out with some lattice precision tests https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/18.04/x86_64/4.15.0-20-generic/petitbonum/2018-05-11%2012:03:31?short

I have also seen the same issues with [GitLab](GitLab) CI tests. The timeout is in `padic_lattice_element` here:

```
sage: R = ZpLC(2, label='init') # indirect doctest ## line 868 ##
sage: R ## line 869 ##
2-adic Ring with lattice-cap precision (label: init)
sage: sig_on_count() # check sig_on/off pairings (virtual doctest) ## line 871 ##
0
sage: R = ZpLC(7, label='init') ## line 878 ##
sage: TestSuite(R).run(skip='_test_teichmuller') ## line 879 ##
```


and in `padic_base_leaves` here

```
sage: TestSuite(R).run(skip=['_test_teichmuller']) ## line 13 ##
```
