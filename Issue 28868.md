# Issue 28868: Add gentoo package information, extend dockerfile generator to gentoo

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29105

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-01-30 02:29:56

CC:  mjo fbissey dimpase @sheerluck

As a followup to #29053, in analogy to the work done for debian/fedora/arch/conda, we
- add files `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/gentoo.txt` to keep track of equivalent distribution packages
- extend `build/bin/write-dockerfile` to generate a Dockerfile for a gentoo "prefix" build.

This is a part of:
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

Creating a dockerfile for setting up sage prerequisites on a Gentoo "prefix" was previously discussed in #28905.

An attempt (incomplete) is at https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/28905/Dockerfile-sage_gentoo and would need help from Gentoo experts.

`compiler can't create executables` in a configure phase of gcc typically means the compiler can't find libgmp and al. Do you have a log for me to review? Prefix on ubuntu is definitely supported. The only thing I can think of is that the bootstrap usually object being run as root.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-30 03:36:24

Thanks, yes, turns out this was not specific to the gentoo prefix installer. I had to add some more packages. Let me see how far I get with this.

OK... this is where I got now. The `./bootstrap-prefix.sh` script was claiming to bootstrap some packages - such as xz and patch - and succeeded with that; but then it was missing "xz" to unpack the Python sources. I think something is wrong there, but I added xz&patch in ubuntu. This is attached Dockerfile-sage_gentoo and log from 'docker build' with that. 

As you can see in the log, now it's complaining about a module missing in the Python that it just built:

```
  File "/gentoo/var/tmp/python-3.6.10/Python-3.6.10/Lib/xml/parsers/expat.py", line 4, in <module>
    from pyexpat import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyexpat'
make: *** [install] Error 1
Makefile:1102: recipe for target 'install' failed
??? Python failed to install *sigh* continuing anyway
* Python bootstrapped
http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots
```

and then dies with:

```

`xz` is rearing up its head again. Yes it should be an early one. Because many more sources are in .xz I am not shocked that it should be a pre-requisite along with patch. The pyexpat stuff is weird. I'll do some experimenting later. I haven't really touched prefix since ppc64 was retired (because I didn't want or could maintain it long term).

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-03-04 00:59:21

This tickets needs help from someone who actually uses Gentoo. I found the instructions for installing stuff inadequate.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-03-04 01:09:04

I use Gentoo, but neither prefix, not docker.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-03-04 01:10:07

I need to make time for this. I cannot give you a time frame.

After installing a docker client, it only takes 

```
docker run -it gentoo/stage3-amd64
```

This gives you root prompt. I would need instructions on what to do next to install relevant gentoo packages here.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-03-04 01:41:49

If I understand well you have a minimal gentoo image running now. What do you want to install? Do you have a list somewhere?

The equivalent of the lists in  build/pkgs/debian-bootstrap.txt and build/pkgs/debian.txt (minimal requirements for bootstrapping and building) -- which would be added in #29273 as well since gentoo packages are being added there.

I can try either this or Gentoo in lxc container, if such a thing exists somewhere.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-03-05 20:31:35

Docker please because that's what my tox.ini infrastructure uses.
If we want to do the same with lxc instead of docker, why not, but perhaps one step at a time?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-03-18 03:13:43

I have created ticket #29283 for the goal of lxc containers for testing, in case someone wants to work on that.

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-15 17:34:10

When I run `tox -e docker-gentoo` I get half-baked `sage/.tox/docker-gentoo/Dockerfile`, I need a way to shove the hand-crafted `Dockerfile` instead (for debugging purposes). What is the best way to do it?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-15 17:45:50

Does your handcrafted Dockerfile work with `docker build` already?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-15 17:47:47

You could insert a line before `    # From https://hub.docker.com/r/multiarch/ubuntu-core/
`
that says

```
    docker-gentoo:  bash -c 'whatever command to create a handcrafted {envdir}/Dockerfile'    

```



---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-15 17:51:43

So right after

```
docker:        bash -c 'build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh  ... > {envdir}/Dockerfile'
```

Thank you!

It does not exist. Someone have to decide where to store an image. I have no idea, my docker-fu is weak.

Also, at the end of `configure`, I see:

```
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc eclib gp2c isl lcalc libsemigroups pandoc pari pari_elldata pari_galdata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata pari_seadata_small perl_cpan_polymake_prereq perl_term_readline_gnu r yasm
checking for the package system in use... gentoo
configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure: # install the following packages: sci-mathematics/eclib[flint] sci-mathematics/gp2c dev-libs/isl app-text/pandoc sci-mathematics/pari sci-mathematics/pari-data XML-Writer XML-LibXML XML-LibXSLT File-Slurp dev-perl/Term-ReadLine-Gnu JSON SVG dev-perl/MongoDB dev-perl/Term-ReadLine-Gnu dev-lang/R
```

Could you update `build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command` so that an actual installation command is displayed?


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-19 06:17:58

I added `gentoo.txt` and `gentoo-bootstrap.txt` and updated `sage-print-system-package-command` and I am going to refresh `sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4:latest` with additional packages (except `pandoc`) and after testing I will push in `u/gh-sheerluck/gentoo` branch

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-19 12:54:02

Now `configure` says "configure:   $ sudo emerge sci-mathematics/eclib[flint] sci-mathematics/gp2c app-text/pandoc sci-mathematics/pari sci-mathematics/pari-data XML-Writer XML-LibXML XML-LibXSLT File-Slurp dev-perl/Term-ReadLine-Gnu JSON SVG dev-perl/MongoDB dev-lang/R" although everything is installed in `sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4:latest` (except `pandoc`)


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-19 15:12:52

For `sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]`, please check whether this syntax does whatever was intended there. See previous discussion in #29273.

`config.log` should give information on why a particular package was rejected by `configure`.


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-19 17:53:24

Reading `config.log` is fascinating.

For example,  "cbc >= 2.9.4" might refer to `sci-libs/coinor-cbc-2.10.5` (https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)

`USE=flint sudo emerge sci-mathematics/eclib`? I am not completely sure `USE` is passed to the `sudo` environment that way. I am not sure how many people use `sudo` on their Gentoo system either. It is not quite the default. I would go

```
USE=flint su -c "emerge sci-mathematics/eclib"
```



---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-06-19 20:42:02

You can leave off the sudo/su command. It's understood that you should have root privileges to use it, and if not, emerge itself will tell you.

The `emerge a[foo] b[bar]` syntax isn't right but there is no one-line command that does what we want. The closest thing is `USE="foo bar" emerge a b`, but the next time the user updates his system those `USE` flags will be lost. It also has the side effect of enabling `USE=foo` for `b` and `USE=bar` for `a`, which may not work. What should really be done is to place


```
a foo
b bar
```


in `/etc/portage/package.use`, or whatever is equivalent for pkgcore (the other Gentoo package manager). Pkgcore has its own, different, installation commands too.

The `a[foo]` syntax does make sense in users' heads, so to keep things simple, we could probably just have it say "install the following packages: a[foo] b[bar]", or something like that.


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-19 21:06:01

Do not worry about USE flags. Every USE flag in `sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4:latest` already is correct, because Dockerfile uses "sage-on-gentoo" overlay. If suddenly we need `sys-devel/bc[foo]` I will go to https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues, wait for `@`fbissey and then refresh latest image. There is no need to have two conflicting places for USE flags, overlay is enough


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-06-19 21:09:24

I was referring only to,

> Now configure says "configure: $ sudo emerge sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]

which won't work =)


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-19 21:16:35

I also thought it won't work but I tried and it works. Maybe there's a bug in portage =)


---

Comment by mjo created at 2020-06-19 21:35:59

Ok, you got me, I had no idea that worked!

It still won't automatically enable the USE flag if it's not set, you get something like


```
$ emerge -pv1 sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]
...
The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
# required by sci-mathematics/eclib[flint] (argument)
>=sci-mathematics/eclib-20190909 flint
```


but that's fine. It's telling you to do the right thing.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-06-20 01:19:50

That's interesting it is basically processed like an atom dependency from an ebuild. It is probably designed so the dependency list can be feed as is to emerge.

I read `m4/sage_spkg_configure.m4` and created `build/pkgs/numpy/spkg-configure.m4`

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([numpy], [
    if build/bin/sage-system-python -c 'import pkgutil; exit(not pkgutil.find_loader("numpy"))'; then
      sage_spkg_install_numpy=no
    else
      sage_spkg_install_numpy=yes
    fi  
    if test x$sage_spkg_install_numpy = xyes; then
      AC_MSG_RESULT([using Sage's numpy SPKG])
    else
      AC_MSG_RESULT([using numpy library from the system])
    fi  
])
```

and `tox -e docker-gentoo-standard` shows

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG numpy...
using numpy library from the system
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG numpy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
numpy-1.16.6:                using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```


I can copy and paste that `spkg-configure.m4` for all `dev-python/*` packages
from the list above. What do you think? Should I proceed?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-22 16:19:49

Please don't. Sage-the-distribution does not use the system Python's site packages. We have a ticket for future work on that: #29023. It will definitely NOT go through spkg-configure.m4.

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-22 20:55:22

I have hard time describing `git diff 9.2.beta1..u/gh-sheerluck/gentoo` , not much was implemented, most of the work is in https://github.com/sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-22 20:57:20

It would be enough to just update the sentence starting with "In this ticket,"


---

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-23 09:45:42

My mistake was I tried only `tox -e docker-gentoo-standard`

I never tried 

`tox -e docker-gentoo-minimal -- build doc-html ptest`

`tox -e docker-gentoo-standard -- build doc-html ptest`

`tox -e docker-gentoo-maximal -- build doc-html ptest`

I'm working on it

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-06-25 06:32:17

Next week in addition to existing `Dockerfile_gentoo-20.06-gcc9-py37`

I plan to make

`Dockerfile_gentoo-20.07-gcc9-py37` (with tags `20.07` and `latest`)

`Dockerfile_gentoo-20.07-gcc9-py38` (with tags `py38-20.07` and `py38-latest`)

And maybe even

`Dockerfile_gentoo-20.07-clang10-py37`

`Dockerfile_gentoo-20.07-clang10-py38`

gcc-10 is not ready for this kind of fun yet

Last error from https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions, namely this one: 

```
It might be possible to solve this slot collision
by applying all of the following changes:
   - sci-libs/m4ri-20200125 (Change USE: +png)
   - sci-libs/brial-1.2.8 (Change USE: +png)

The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
# required by sci-libs/brial-1.2.8::sage-on-gentoo
# required by sci-libs/brial (argument)
>=sci-libs/m4ri-20200125 -png

is solved with `png` for `sci-libs/brial` in `latest` image

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-07-12 10:16:19

I've created `latest-gcc10` in addition to `latest`. For fun. 


```
 version in            latest         latest-gcc10
====================================================
 sys-devel/gcc         9.3.0          10.1.0-r2
 sci-libs/arpack       3.1.5          3.5.0
 sci-mathematics/gp2c  0.0.11.2-r1    0.0.11.3
 app-misc/rlwrap       0.42           0.43
```


But `tox -e docker-gentoo-gcc10-maximal -- build doc-html doc-pdf ptest` says 

```
checking gcc version... 10.1.0
checking g++ version... 10.1.0
configure: Installing GCC because g++ -std=gnu++11 is g++ version 10.1.0, which is too recent for this version of Sage 
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gcc
```


Sage is not ready for gcc10 yet...

but if anyone wants to play with `latest-gcc10` it's available on hub.docker.com


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-07-12 10:22:07

Thanks. A related latest annoyance is that on macOS Homebrew provides gcc package, which is gcc-10, and this breaks things (even though only gfortran is used, not gcc).

Comment by @sheerluck created at 2020-08-04 17:22:10

Good news, everyone!
We used one `latest` image, now we have two images:
 * `latest` with python-3.8.5
 * `latest-py37` with python-3.7.8



```
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... no, Python 3.8.5 is too recent
```


no changes to tox.ini is required, unless we want to be prepared for #29023 when most of installed packages would be used, in that case we can have both "gentoo" and "gentoo-py37" in tox.ini

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-08-04 17:25:01

Great! You may want to test with #27754, which aims for Python 3.8 compatibility


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-08-04 21:06:45

For the record sage-on-gentoo enables building with python 3.8 since 9.2.beta7. Building of the documentation with it may currently be failing though (but I managed a build between beta6 and beta7 somehow).

Please mask `brial-1.2.9` there are issues with it and it will be replaced by 1.2.10 in short order.

```
checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules ...  
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... yes
```


Although overlay `cschwan/sage-on-gentoo` is not ready for `python-3.9` yet, 
`develop` branch of `sagemath/sage` accepts `python-3.9`.

So as if two images weren't enough, I used some ugly hacks to create third image -- `latest-py39`

If someone finds it usefull to play with python-3.9, tox.ini may be changed this way:

That bug has ruined monthful of latest https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/ :(

I'm going to post a branch that removes the memlimit and then turn off my computer for a month while people yell at me.

`latest` image contains `clang-12.0.1` for `tox -e docker-gentoo-maximal`

At https://github.com/orlitzky/sage/runs/3851208039?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:11493 I see **Pytest is not installed, skip checking tests that rely on it.**

Well, that is not true, `latest` image got `/usr/bin/py.test` and `/usr/bin/pytest`

you need pytest in sage's venv.

e.g.

```
make pytest
```

will do the trick
