CC:  @orlitzky @kiwifb @dimpase @sheerluck

As a followup to #29053, in analogy to the work done for debian/fedora/arch/conda, we
- add files `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/gentoo.txt` to keep track of equivalent distribution packages
- extend `build/bin/write-dockerfile` to generate a Dockerfile for a gentoo "prefix" build.

This is a part of:
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29105

Creating a dockerfile for setting up sage prerequisites on a Gentoo "prefix" was previously discussed in #28905.

An attempt (incomplete) is at https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/28905/Dockerfile-sage_gentoo and would need help from Gentoo experts.

As you can see in the log, now it's complaining about a module missing in the Python that it just built:

After installing a docker client, it only takes 

```
docker run -it gentoo/stage3-amd64
```

This gives you root prompt. I would need instructions on what to do next to install relevant gentoo packages here.

You can leave off the sudo/su command. It's understood that you should have root privileges to use it, and if not, emerge itself will tell you.

The `emerge a[foo] b[bar]` syntax isn't right but there is no one-line command that does what we want. The closest thing is `USE="foo bar" emerge a b`, but the next time the user updates his system those `USE` flags will be lost. It also has the side effect of enabling `USE=foo` for `b` and `USE=bar` for `a`, which may not work. What should really be done is to place


```
a foo
b bar
```


in `/etc/portage/package.use`, or whatever is equivalent for pkgcore (the other Gentoo package manager). Pkgcore has its own, different, installation commands too.

The `a[foo]` syntax does make sense in users' heads, so to keep things simple, we could probably just have it say "install the following packages: a[foo] b[bar]", or something like that.

Ok, you got me, I had no idea that worked!

It still won't automatically enable the USE flag if it's not set, you get something like


```
$ emerge -pv1 sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]
...
The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
# required by sci-mathematics/eclib[flint] (argument)
>=sci-mathematics/eclib-20190909 flint
```


but that's fine. It's telling you to do the right thing.
