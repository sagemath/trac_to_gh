AFAIK the "error messages" are suboptimal as well, i.e., at least in some cases exceptions get raised (e.g. `KeyError` IIRC) and tracebacks printed instead of "`Error: <informative text>`".

I think Python tracebacks are more useful than manual error messages, not less. Of course os.system() doesn't raise exceptions so some amount of manual error messages is unavoidable.

I'd rather keep working on packaging Atlas 3.9.x, any further frobnicating the old package is a waste of time imho.

I don't think "I'm working on a new version of feature X" is ever a good excuse to not fix the old feature X.

Besides, I think the changes here are likely good for ATLAS-3.9.x also.

Needs review.

ATLAS-3.9.x is sufficiently different that it requires major changes. The shared library stuff is completely different for starters. I'm happy to apply the changes that still apply in the next version but I'm not going to spend time reviewing this ticket.
