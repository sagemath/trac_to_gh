AFAIK the "error messages" are suboptimal as well, i.e., at least in some cases exceptions get raised (e.g. `KeyError` IIRC) and tracebacks printed instead of "`Error: <informative text>`".

I think Python tracebacks are more useful than manual error messages, not less. Of course os.system() doesn't raise exceptions so some amount of manual error messages is unavoidable.
