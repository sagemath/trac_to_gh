# Issue 14144: Implement cycle index of combinatorial logarithm (virtual) species

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: agd

Assignee: agd

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: cycle index, species

The semiring of species can be completed to form the ring of "virtual species", which are certain equivalence classes of formal differences of species. Among other benefits, this allows the "compositional inverse" of a species to be defined. It turns out that virtual species have well-defined cycle index series (which may have negative coefficients).

This patch adds code to compute the cycle index of the "combinatorial logarithm" virtual species, which is the compositional inverse of the species of nonempty sets. Among other things, this can be used to extract the cycle index of a species of "connected F-structures" from the cycle index for the species F. (The standard example is the case of the species G of simple graphs.)

I believe this code is functional and complete.

* Every function must be doc-tested. You should add doc and examples to auxiliary functions too.

I've uploaded a new version for the patch which includes docstrings and EXAMPLES:: doctests for all methods.

Thanks for the feedback!

If you are happy with the little changes in my review patch, you can set a positive review in my behalf.

Thanks for the patch! As you can see, I don't quite have the hang of the doctest system yet.

The patch is not a proper patch file, patches should be generated using hg export tip. Also make sure you have `.hgrc` set up, see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/)

Whoops! Thanks for the tip.

I've added a new version of the patch created using "hg export tip". This version includes the adjustments suggested by chapoton. (Is this correct form? Should I leave those changes in a separate patch?)

yes, its ok (but it was not necessary) to include my changes in your patches.
