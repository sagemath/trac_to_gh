That's a neat addition, but I don't quite like lattice name decoration and I think it will not look nice with repeated direct sums. Unfortunately, I am not sure what would be better.

One solution is to replace default names with "N3" for a 3-d lattice N, with `N^{3}` for LaTeX purposes so that `N^3_\RR` looks nicely. This is actually handy when one works with many lattices of different dimensions, and we can then shorten the current `_repr_` of lattices from "3-d lattice N" to just "N3" with cones printed as "2-d cone in N3". I think I am in favour of such a change, the major problem here is that we'll have to fix a lot of doctests, but better now than later ;-)

As a lazier alternative I propose not to change names at all - if a user does not like names "N+N", there is an option to provide custom ones.

In the P2xP2 example I'd say that one should expect the product fan to live exactly in `N+N` so I think that

```
        rank = self.rank() + other.rank()
        if self._name==other._name:
            name=None
            dual_name=None
        else:
            name = make_name(self, other, False)
            dual_name = make_name(self.dual(), other.dual(), False)
        if latex(self)==latex(other):
            latex_name=None
            latex_dual_name=None
        else:
            latex_name = make_name(self, other, True)
            latex_dual_name = make_name(self.dual(), other.dual(), True)
        return ToricLattice(rank, name, dual_name, latex_name, latex_dual_name)
```

can be replaced with

```
        rank = self.rank() + other.rank()
        name = make_name(self, other, False)
        dual_name = make_name(self.dual(), other.dual(), False)
        latex_name = make_name(self, other, True)
        latex_dual_name = make_name(self.dual(), other.dual(), True)
        return ToricLattice(rank, name, dual_name, latex_name, latex_dual_name)
```

for simplicity and consistency. Note that if the user makes "lattice N" explicitly, then

```
sage: myN = ToricLattice(3, "N")
sage: myN.dual()
3-d lattice N*
```

so if I try to take the sum `N + myN`, the result has names

```
N, M, N, M
```

but `N.dual() + myN.dual()` will give

```
M+N*, N+N, M \oplus N^*, N \oplus N
```

in particular, the sum of duals is not the dual of the sum. With the simpler code that does not try to be intelligent, the first set of names would be

```
N+N, M+N*, N \oplus N, M \oplus N^*
```

and the duality will work nicely.

Since duality is important not just for pretty printing, but also for action on lattices, I now strongly feel that the sum should always be called just "left+right".

Of course, it is not difficult to add a few more checks to your code to avoid the above problem. One can also ask if we should identify 4-d N with 2-d N + 2-d N or treat these lattices as different. I guess with my suggestions they will be different, but 2-d N + 2-d N would be the same as 1-d N + 3-d N.

Kind of a compromise would be to allow user to provide all names as optional input to `direct_sum` and if any names were given - pass them to the lattice constructor instead of concatenating existing names. But as a default I still think `N+N` is the best.

Minor point: it seems that there is no need to import `LatexExpr` inside the sum function.

Hi Volker,

Technical note: the patch applies almost fine on top of 4.6.2.rc0+10522+10675 which are positively reviewed. "Almost" disappears if the very first hunk in your patch for cones is removed. Since it is just a white space issue, I propose that you remove it and this ticket becomes next in line after 10675.

I was unifying documentation and optimizing code, so now you need to review the result ;-) Changes that I have made:
1. Ray collections can compute their products and the result is used by cones and fans.
2. Default dual lattices are now `ZZ^n`, as we have agreed to do on some ticket but it was never done.
3. Fans are now computing their product using "internal representation of fans" rather then products of cones. This should be much faster and more memory efficient then constructing all separate cones and then using them to generate a fan. I have also included optimization for products of complete fans (the product will know that it is complete as well).
4. CPR-Fano toric varieties can now handle products with common toric varieties.
5. It is possible to give custom names to variables of the product varieties.

I also thought that `Cartesian_product` is more in the spirit of other names in our modules, but I have discovered that toric varieties already have `CartesianProduct` and `cartesian_product` inherited from general categories framework. I think that it would be confusing to add `Cartesian_product` as well. I also don't quite feel comfortable overriding `cartesian_product` with something that has nothing to do with the base method (I mean - they both are Cartesian products, but treated quite differently). So, I am not quite sure what to do... What are your thoughts about it? Did you know about these methods? Maybe new methods should be called just `product`? Once we settle on something, I will update my patch.

Judging from what Nicolas said on sage-combinat-devel, I don't think that we should cover generic `cartesian_product`.

So as a somewhat dirty but quick solution I propose changing names of new methods to just `product`.

As a potentially better but longer alternative I think we should
* Learn a bit more about current Cartesian products framework.
* Implement classes `CartesianProductOfToricVarieties(ToricVariety_field, maybe-some-standard-product-class)` and `CartesianProductOfCPRFanoToricVarieties(CPRFanoToricVariety_field, CartesianProductOfToricVarieties)` that will behave like varieties but at the same time will know their product structure and in particular have projection methods.
* Make `cartesian_product` methods return objects of these classes.
I think such functionality would be great, but I'd rather leave its implementation to the future...
