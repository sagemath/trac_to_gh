# Issue 34060: GAP interface hangs waiting for prompt

Recently, the Sage testsuite started timing out on the NixOS aarch64 builder for no discernible reason. Investigation revealed that many tests were stuck on a `select()` syscall waiting for an external program's prompt. Almost all of the stuck test runners were waiting for `gap` (moreover, every time Python was waiting on a non-`gap` program, such as `Singular`, the `pid` property on the `SageSpawn` object didn't match any running process). Unfortunately, although I could reproduce this every time on an Oracle Cloud aarch64 machine, I was initially unable to reproduce the issue locally (but see below).

Reading the source code a bit, I found a comment on [src/sage/interfaces/expect.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/interfaces/expect.py?h=9.6&id=bf6aeb906d0b7cfb12b5dab90f4f096a6192ff43#n71) saying that code that sends data and waits for a result should temporarily disable the garbage collector by using a `with gc_disabled():` block. The `gap` interface didn't seem to be doing this, so I decided, as an experiment, to add `with gc_disabled():` blocks around communication code in `interfaces/gap.py` in the most ham-fisted way I could ([here is the hacky patch I used](https://github.com/collares/nixpkgs/blob/8af8cb3eef1de2af881694de7a1575b5f3449b45/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/disable-gc-gap.patch)). To my surprise, this made every test that uses gap hang indefinitely at [this line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/interfaces/gap.py?h=9.6&id=bf6aeb906d0b7cfb12b5dab90f4f096a6192ff43#n524), even on my x86_64 computer.

I would also be happy to apply further patches to get extra debugging output.

This was reproduced both with ptyprocess 0.5.1 and 0.7.0, by the way.

Does the output of the gap process give any insights? For example by using `sage.interfaces.gap.gap = Gap(logfile="LOG")`

An old version of the description had some invalid information. I've since edited it to fix the problems.

After updating to GAP 4.12 and applying the patch in #34391, this no longer happens on Nix's aarch64 builders. For some weird reason, this still happens on an Oracle Cloud free tier box, but I don't know how to debug that (and, given that it might be some interaction with Oracle's cloud monitoring tools, I don't really care).
