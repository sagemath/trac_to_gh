Keywords: textcell unicode

In a TextCell (shift+click on the blue line) I write some letters:

after I save it. It looks fine:

but when I double click on it to edit, then I get:

That's the problem. I could not find out what (Python or TinyMCE) converts the special characters to html entities (for example Ã© to &eacute;), but it does not convert all of them.

The patch solves the problem. Without it the html code looks like:

using the patch everything's fine. The html code after applying the patch:

The Ticket 6464 is nearly the same. I suggest the solution of 6464 to use.
