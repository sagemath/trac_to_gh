Can you explain somewhere how this works and what needs to be running?   Is it some server you setup somewhere?

There's a 100-line server at http://trac.sagemath.org:12000/ (source /home/robertwb/github-trac/listen.py) that listens for github web hooks https://developer.github.com/webhooks/. I'm just running it manually now, long term we'll probably want to incorporate it into apache (via mod_wsgi). Right now it has the github user password in the source, and uses my ssh keys (on trac.sagemath.org) to push to trac, so we'll need to straighten that out before pushing the code somewhere more public.

I'm using the github web hooks for the buildbot and they usually work but don't seem to be 100% reliable. Though might be something wrong on our side, too. Just FYI
