It's okay as is stands, but perhaps this slight tweak:

```
The issue: ``plot(h(x), 0, 4)`` plots the line `y=x−2`, not the multi-line
function defined by ``h``. The reason? In the command ``plot(h(x), 0, 4)``,
first ``h(x)`` is evaluated: this means plugging the symbolic variable ``x``
into the function ``h``. So the inequality ``x < 2`` evaluates to ``False``
first, and hence ``h(x)`` evaluates to ``x - 2``. This can be seen with
