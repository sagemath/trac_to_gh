In [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/DQQrnFdhoAo) there was a mention of a confusing sentence. We correct it here.

It's okay as is stands, but perhaps this slight tweak:

```
The issue: ``plot(h(x), 0, 4)`` plots the line `y=x−2`, not the multi-line
function defined by ``h``. The reason? In the command ``plot(h(x), 0, 4)``,
first ``h(x)`` is evaluated: this means plugging the symbolic variable ``x``
into the function ``h``. So the inequality ``x < 2`` evaluates to ``False``
first, and hence ``h(x)`` evaluates to ``x - 2``. This can be seen with
```

to better emphasize the order in which things occur.

Not every utf-8 dash is a minus sign:

```

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

l.1689 ...plot(h(x), 0, 4)} plots the line $y=x−
                                                  2$, not the multi-line
? 
! Emergency stop.

Sorry... I did a stupid copy paste. I double check that it is pure ascii.

All right. I wondered what was this cryptic ".. link", now I see (and I should have look to the developer manual).

I ran the long tests on the whole tutorial and it is fine.
