It can be useful to query the free variables in an expression.  SR's `variables()` and `arguments()` return all variables in an expression, whether free or bound.  For example:


```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: function('f')
f
sage: e = limit( f(x,y), x=0 )
sage: e
limit(f(x, y), x, 0)
sage: e.variables()
(x, y)
```


I would like to have a `free_variables()` method that returns only `y` in this case.  Is there a recommended way to get this information from an expression?

These are practically all variables, minus the one(s) the limit is over?
