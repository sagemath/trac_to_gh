# Issue 19942: add a free_variables() method?

It can be useful to query the free variables in an expression.  SR's `variables()` and `arguments()` return all variables in an expression, whether free or bound.  For example:


```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: function('f')
f
sage: e = limit( f(x,y), x=0 )
sage: e
limit(f(x, y), x, 0)
sage: e.variables()
(x, y)
```


I would like to have a `free_variables()` method that returns only `y` in this case.  Is there a recommended way to get this information from an expression?

These are practically all variables, minus the one(s) the limit is over?

The free variables in an expression are all its variables excluding any that are bound, for example, in limits, sums, products, or integrals.

See for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables for a definition.

Implemented in pynac git master. Will be in the upcoming Pynac-0.7.6.

This is not ready for review because it doesn't work as expected but at least the interface is there now.

The problems seem resolved, now that there is a symbolic limit, and code in Pynac master that recognizes it and its bound symbols.

Is this ready for review? If so, then you can set it to positive review on my behalf.

Yes, I usually wait until the merge of the Pynac upgrade because not all reviewers want to go through the hassle of manual Pynac install. Thanks.
