# Issue 12548: Add speed regression database to doctesting

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12720

Currently there's no systematic way of detecting whether a change to the sage library drastically slows down some function (perhaps even the function that's being updated in a ticket).

This ticket aims to add features to the new doctesting code at #12415 that provide the option to run doctests in a mode where they add timing data to a database.

Could monitoring Sage's startup time be incorporated into this?

Now that #12415 is in Sage, I'll be working on this some.  It will probably be at least a few weeks though (I'm going to be working on p-adics and the git transition first).

In the mean time, I've updated the patches to apply against #12415 (actually, rebased against #13278).  There's still a lot to be done to make them work well.

roed, I believe that this should probably be closed. The approach of rolling our own system for doing something that asv does very well is probably not appropriate anymore. What do you think?
