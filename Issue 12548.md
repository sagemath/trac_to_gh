Currently there's no systematic way of detecting whether a change to the sage library drastically slows down some function (perhaps even the function that's being updated in a ticket).

This ticket aims to add features to the new doctesting code at #12415 that provide the option to run doctests in a mode where they add timing data to a database.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12720

Now that #12415 is in Sage, I'll be working on this some.  It will probably be at least a few weeks though (I'm going to be working on p-adics and the git transition first).

In the mean time, I've updated the patches to apply against #12415 (actually, rebased against #13278).  There's still a lot to be done to make them work well.
