This is a meta ticket giving a road map for the cleanup of CombinatorialFreeModule

 - Provide an implementation of ModulesWithBasis using a FreeModule_sparse internally with a ranker (as was done in MuPAD)

 - #10671: Extend FreeModule(K, n, sparse=True) to accept n=infinity

 - Rename CombinatorialFreeModule to something more appropriate in sage.modules, and leave a temporary alias with deprecation warning for backward compatibility

 - Make FreeModule(base_ring, enumerated set) call CombinatorialFreeModule
   Strongly related to #10672

 - #10672: Put FreeModule in the category ModulesWithBasis()

 - #9370: customize printing of elements in CombinatorialFreeModules

I don't how how it is related to this roadmap but #10007 still make hard to mix current sage FreeModule(...) and categories. As this kind of roadmap go further than my skills (English and overview of Sage), just mind this comment as a pointer to this last problem. Update the description if you think #10007 should do inside...

Some thoughts for renaming `CombinatorialFreeModule`:

- `FreeModule_indexed`
- `FreeModule_indexed_basis`
- `IndexedFreeModule`
- `FreeModuleIndexedBasis`

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
