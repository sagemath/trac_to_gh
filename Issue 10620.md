This is a meta ticket giving a road map for the cleanup of CombinatorialFreeModule

- Provide an implementation of ModulesWithBasis using a FreeModule_sparse internally with a ranker (as was done in MuPAD)

- #10671: Extend FreeModule(K, n, sparse=True) to accept n=infinity

- Rename CombinatorialFreeModule to something more appropriate in sage.modules, and leave a temporary alias with deprecation warning for backward compatibility

- Make FreeModule(base_ring, enumerated set) call CombinatorialFreeModule
  Strongly related to #10672

- #10672: Put FreeModule in the category ModulesWithBasis()

- #9370: customize printing of elements in CombinatorialFreeModules

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10673
