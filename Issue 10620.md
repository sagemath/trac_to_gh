This is a meta ticket giving a road map for the cleanup of CombinatorialFreeModule

- Provide an implementation of ModulesWithBasis using a FreeModule_sparse internally with a ranker (as was done in MuPAD)

- #10671: Extend FreeModule(K, n, sparse=True) to accept n=infinity

- Rename CombinatorialFreeModule to something more appropriate in sage.modules, and leave a temporary alias with deprecation warning for backward compatibility

- Make FreeModule(base_ring, enumerated set) call CombinatorialFreeModule
  Strongly related to #10672

- #10672: Put FreeModule in the category ModulesWithBasis()

- #9370: customize printing of elements in CombinatorialFreeModules

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10673

I don't how how it is related to this roadmap but #10007 still make hard to mix current sage FreeModule(...) and categories. As this kind of roadmap go further than my skills (English and overview of Sage), just mind this comment as a pointer to this last problem.
