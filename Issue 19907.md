I think it is a good idea to have the catalog referenced in some place in the top-level doc for the algebras (which includes making sure it gets built). So if you agree with my change, then this is a positive review. Thank you for doing the grouping!

Thanks for looking at that, Travis.
Did you mean to duplicate the catalog entry ?
I kept only the top one, and moved `group algebra` in the section "named algebras".
Do you agree ? Can I set to positive review ?

No, I did not. I completely didn't see that. *facepalm*

I agree, but you cannot set a positive review because I have already done so. And now my evil plan is complete! muhahaha. :P
