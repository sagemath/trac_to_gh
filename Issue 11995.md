There is absolutely no reason for `$SAGE_ROOT/ipythonrc` to be in the root repo.  It would better be moved to `$SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/dotsage/ipython`.  The idea then being that the whole contents of `extcode/dotsage` would be copied to `$DOT_SAGE`.

Did you mean instead

```
local/lib/python/site-packages/IPython
```


The `ipython` files currently in `SAGE_ROOT` actually differ quite a bit from the files in that directory, so I'm not sure we can simply copy the files from `ipython`.

Also, there is a file `$SAGE_ROOT/ipython/ipythonrc-scipy` which isn't anywhere else (not even in the scipy spkg).

I'm tempted to make #12719 a prerequisite for this: we should update to IPython 0.12, and this will require (I think) revising the formats of the configuration files.  While doing that, we can also move them elsewhere, or just create a single Sage config file and put it somewhere sensible.
