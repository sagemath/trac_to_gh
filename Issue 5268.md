There are a lot of design issues which concern combinatorial classes. They are currently discussed on the mailing list and on the wiki. See
    http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/
    http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/fbf6d9c2ba7cac15
    http://wiki.sagemath.org/CombinatorialClass 
Someones has to lead/moderate these discussions, to summarize the result and to incorporate it into sage doc. After this we should emit a bunch of tickets to update the various combinatorial classes to this design.
