I'd like to look at this - can you confirm that you are giving positive review to Eviatar's original changes?  If so, I think I only need to give this one more good look and try out some more numerical things to confirm it's ready to go.

By the way, I note some inconsistency (probably due to my relative unfamiliarity with elliptic integrals).  I see

```
This returns the value of the "incomplete elliptic integral of the
    second kind"
