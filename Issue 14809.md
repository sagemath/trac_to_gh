Need to get full doctest coverage.

Changing keywords from "" to "special, functions".

This is now ready for review.

BTW, is Maxima not able to solve the resp. integrals?

```
sage: integrate(sqrt(1 - m*sin(x)^2), x, 0, phi)
sage: integrate(sqrt(1 - m*sin(x)^2), x, 0, pi/2)
sage: integrate(1/sqrt(1 - m*sin(x)^2), x, 0, phi)
```

With this `MaximaFunction` is no longer used. I tend to put it in its own source file in `functions`. Comments?

Do you mean it isn't used _at all_?  Wow!  I guess that is a good thing, though.

I'd like to look at this - can you confirm that you are giving positive review to Eviatar's original changes?  If so, I think I only need to give this one more good look and try out some more numerical things to confirm it's ready to go.

By the way, I note some inconsistency (probably due to my relative unfamiliarity with elliptic integrals).  I see

```
This returns the value of the "incomplete elliptic integral of the
    second kind"
```

in two places, `EllipticE` and `EllipticEU`.  Since [the Maxima manual](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_16.html#Item_003a-elliptic_005feu) clarifies the relationship, we should too.  Indeed, there is a bunch of stuff in here which assumes familiarity with syntax for the Jacobi functions `dn` or `sn` or the rest which should be clarified.  Maybe a link in internal documentation to that file, or perhaps some Wikipedia refs would also not be amiss?  Just throwing out doc ideas, as long as we implement a little more it will be fine.

Sage startup time increased by 0.3%, why?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-15 01:07:18

I am pretty sure that is from a bad startup time test batch. Also, could you break the longer lines to ~80 characters?

Comment by rws created at 2016-06-15 06:25:28

I didn't break all the lines. If you insist I'll try again. Anything else?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-15 13:34:41

I would prefer if the doctest output lines were split, probably 1 term per line should be good (or more if they are shorter). Once you do that, you can set a positive review on my behalf

I couldn't break lines at `abc*xyz` (bug?) but it worked at `abc - xyz` and `abc + xyz` so I succeeded in most of the cases.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-15 15:35:55

Thanks. What you did is exactly what I was looking for and plenty good. The reason why `abc*xyz` cannot split is because there is no whitespace around the operator (and newlines get counted as whitespace, which the doctest framework ignores all after one whitespace char).

Resolution: fixed
