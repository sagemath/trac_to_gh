# Issue 20120: Expose matroid union functionality to user

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20357

Original creator: Stefan

Original creation time: 2016-04-04 19:11:44

Matroid union was implemented in sage.matroids.union_matroid . It would be nice to expose this functionality to users as:

1) a method Matroid.union()
2) By importing MatroidUnion in sage.matroids.advanced

This ticket appears to overlap with #19069 

There is some discussion there about how to best categorize this and related functions.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
