Failed example:
    oeis('beaver', max_results=4, first_result=2)     # optional -- internet
Expected:
    0: A131956: Busy Beaver variation: maximum number of steps for ...
    1: A141475: Number of Turing machines with n states following ...
    2: A131957: Busy Beaver sigma variation: maximum number of 1's ...

Got:
    0: A131956: Busy Beaver variation: maximum number of steps for a 2-state, 2-symbol Turing machine running on a tape which is initialized with the number n in binary and 0's everywhere else. The machine is started at the rightmost bit in the number n.
    1: A141475: Number of Turing machines with n states following the standard formalism of the busy beaver problem where the head of a Turing machine either moves to the right or to the left, but none once halted.
    2: A131957: Busy Beaver sigma variation: maximum number of 1's on the final tape, for a 2-state, 2-symbol Turing machine running on a tape which is initialized with the number n in binary and 0's everywhere else. The machine is started at the rightmost bit in the number n.
    3: A333479: Busy Beaver for binary lambda calculus: the maximum normal form size of any closed lambda term of size n, or 0 if no closed term of size n exists.

1 item had failures:
   1 of   5 in sage.databases.oeis.OEIS.find_by_description
    5 webbrowser tests not run
    0 tests not run because we ran out of time
