CC:  vdelecroix dimpase

This branch adds resolvable_bibd.py to combinat/designs/. It contains a couple of constructions for resolvable (v,k,1)-BIBD when k=3,4.

Not all RBIBD with k=3,4 can be built, but I have on my computer the general construction for RBIBD with k=3. This is part of it, and the rest will follow in small pieces, as there are many "design questions" involved.

Hello Nathann,

1) What's the point of

```
-Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD)
+(BIBD) Balanced Incomplete Block Designs
```

I prefer the former.

2) Do you know if difference family/difference set can be used to generate RBIBD? (It seems to be no, I will think about it)

will continue later.

Oh. I made that change because ultimately it will be easier to read in this page:

The lines will begin with BIBD/BIBD,GDD, i.e. the signs that we are used to see and spot easily.

Depends.. In the constrution I have on my computer for KTS there are several designs built from difference families.

They are resolvable, but then some new points are added to build larger designs. Well, you will see.

For the moment it is not a Sage patch because there are many things in `needs_review`, and that writing the commit now will mean a lot of conflicts to solve later.

Hello,

See my commit at `u/vdelecroix/17581`.

1) Why not return an object with type `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`. That way you can add to the examples `.is_resolvable()`. (moreover, contrarily to the others `v_4_1_rbibd` does!?)

2) The lines

```
bla.extend([a**(i+j0),a**(i+j1),a**(i+j2)] for i in a_big_list])
```

are ugly... I changed a bit one of them but I am still not happy to have a quadratic complexity when linear is doable.

3) I used `discrete_log` where you did a `while` loop... should be faster.

Looks good. About the example of KTS at the beginning of the doc: I tried to write it in such a way that it is both informative and readable by users. Yours is prettier indeed, but.. Clearly harder to read. Anyway let's talk about this before it is changed, next time.

> 1) Why not return an object with type `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`. That way you can add to the examples `.is_resolvable()`. (moreover, contrarily to the others `v_4_1_rbibd` does!?)

I do not understand your sentence. Where isn't a `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` object returned?

> 2) The lines
> {{{

AHahah. Well compared to the complexity of other parts of the algorithm I am sure that it makes no difference. By the way isn't it a `nlog(n)` complexity ? Exponents are cheap.

> 3) I used `discrete_log` where you did a `while` loop... should be faster.

Oh thanks, I did not know that we had that. There must be some other spot where it is needed in the code then, for I am sure that I missed it once at least.

Assuming that you see nothing else to change, I set this ticket to `positive_review`. Thanks for your help again, there would be no design code in Sage if not for that `^^;`

look at the case for `k=2` in `resolvable_balanced_incomplete_block_design`. And by the way

```
sage: KTS = designs.resolvable_balanced_incomplete_block_design(8,2); KTS
