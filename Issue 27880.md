# Issue 27880: Implement function that returns binomial transform of sequence

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28117

Original creator: @sheareralexj

Original creation time: 2019-07-04 17:18:01

CC:  kdilks

This ticket adds the binomial transform and inverse binomial transform functions for sequences. For example, this enables:

```
sage: binom_trans([fibonacci(n) for n in [0..9]])
[0, 1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, 377, 987, 2584]
```


```
sage: binom_trans_inv([4^n for n in [0..9]])
[1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683]
```

* I don't see any particular reason to use abbreviations in the method names, they can just be spelled out as `binomial_transform()` and `binomial_transform_inverse()`.

* The `SEEALSO:` blocks need to be `.. SEEALSO:`.

* I don't like the choice of `a` as the input, it doesn't stick out as being the name of a variable when you don't have additional formatting available (like reading doc in the terminal).

* I would manually program in a hack that would allow 'n' to be a negative integer, and when is 'n' is negative, it gives you the `len(a)-n+1`st element of the transform (so it matches Python convention of the -1 giving you the last entry of a list.

* I don't think the OUTPUT strings should have capitalized "OR", I think a comma and lowercase would suffice.

I will hopefully be able to make these changes this week during Sage Days, but typing them out so I don't forget.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Thanks for the edits, Kevin. I updated the documentation a bit as well.

I would suggest not to have this in the global namespace, but rather as a method of "oeis" so that one can do something like "oeis.binomial_transform".

EDIT: or maybe this is not a good idea. But not imported by default in the global namespace please

Perhaps link it as a method on a univariate (lazy?) formal power series or `Sequence` object? I am not as convinced as you about not having this in the global namespace, but I do lean towards not having it imported there.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Having the simplest method (besides writing it yourself) to do a binomial transform being a method on lazy power series is a bit user-unfriendly. Putting it in ``Sequences`` would make sense. There's also https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/calculus/transforms/dft.html . I don't think it's the best place, but if you put `binomial_transform` in ``Sequences``, it would be natural to continue with Stirling transforms, convolutions, and then you start to run into multiple methods doing the exact same thing as in `Indexed_Sequence` with no clear reason for the duplication.
