Found a small oversight in latex functions for Function_sum and Function_prod :

```
sage: latex(sum(sin(X(j)),j,1,p))
{\sum_{j=1}^{p} sin(X(j))}
```

whereas what is sought is something along the lines of `{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \sin\left(X\left(j\right)\right)`}

Yet another note :

`sum()` expands its first argument. I'm not sure that this is pertinent. Compare :

```
sage: sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2,j,1,p)
sum(X(j)^2 + 2*X(j)*Y(j) + Y(j)^2, j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum(((X(j)+Y(j))^2),j,1,p)").sage()
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p)
```


I have implemented (in a private branch), an "expand" option controlling if `distribute()` should expand its first argument (default) or not (might come in handy in some situations). This allows :


```
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute()
sum(X(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(2*X(j)*Y(j), j, 1, p) + sum(Y(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute(expand=False)
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
```


But this currently works only from sum expressions cast from Maxima ; Sage-built sums get expanded //volens nolens//, as seen above, and the resulting expansions can't be factorized back by `factor()`.

Possible solution : an "expand" keyword argument to sum (default=True) controlling the expansion ? What do you think ?

The same goes, of course, for products.

This has been rebased over 8.0.beta7 (which incorporates #22937). Three fixes :
* Latex generation for symbolic sums and products.
* A `.prod()` method for symbolic expressions.
* A public `product()` function (I wanted to nmae it `prod`, but this clashes irreconciliably with the existing `prod` function for lists and others. I you see how to implement this, you're welcome...).

Passes `ptestlong` with the usual transient `sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py` failure, which is transient.

Indeed : giac is now standard...

Indeed.

But I'm not so sure : the Mathematica interface has other (serious) problems, that can be triggered also in sums and products. This, IMHO, is a distinct problem, and should be fixed by someone knowing what it does with Mathematica (I don't...). 

Is it reasonable do document a (good) way to use a (flaky) interface ? I let you judge...

Right...
