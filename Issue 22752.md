Continued from #17505 this ticket fixes LaTeX, documentation, and doctest issues around the symbolic product.

BTW, Maxima can give back some "interesting" results:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: symbolic_product(1+(-1)^(x+1)/x,x,1,oo)            
...
ValueError: power::eval(): pow(1, Infinity) is not defined.
```

Can't pull this branch in mine : I've rebased on 8.0.beta6,and this one has a modification on `src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py` incompatible with yours.

I ended up using your branch and resolve the conflict, so this depends on #22937.

Found a small oversight in latex functions for Function_sum and Function_prod :

```
sage: latex(sum(sin(X(j)),j,1,p))
{\sum_{j=1}^{p} sin(X(j))}
```

whereas what is sought is something along the lines of `{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \sin\left(X\left(j\right)\right)`}

Patch suggestion :

```

         """

 symbolic_sum = Function_sum()

             sage: latex(sprod(x^2, x, 1, 10))
             {\prod_{x=1}^{10} x^2}
         """
-        return r"{{\prod_`}={`^`` {}}}".format(var, a, b, x)
+        return r"{{\prod_`}={`^`` {}}}".format(latex(var), latex(a),
+                                                       latex(b), latex(x))
 
 symbolic_product = Function_prod()
```


Simple-minded but correct (I think).

Yet another note :

`sum()` expands its first argument. I'm not sure that this is pertinent. Compare :

```
sage: sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2,j,1,p)
sum(X(j)^2 + 2*X(j)*Y(j) + Y(j)^2, j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum(((X(j)+Y(j))^2),j,1,p)").sage()
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p)
```


I have implemented (in a private branch), an "expand" option controlling if `distribute()` should expand its first argument (default) or not (might come in handy in some situations). This allows :


```
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute()
sum(X(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(2*X(j)*Y(j), j, 1, p) + sum(Y(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute(expand=False)
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
```


But this currently works only from sum expressions cast from Maxima ; Sage-built sums get expanded //volens nolens//, as seen above, and the resulting expansions can't be factorized back by `factor()`.

Possible solution : an "expand" keyword argument to sum (default=True) controlling the expansion ? What do you think ?

The same goes, of course, for products.

Please take take ASAP of the apply/python3 issue introduced in #22937.

The branch is fine.

This has been rebased over 8.0.beta7 (which incorporates #22937). Three fixes :
* Latex generation for symbolic sums and products.
* A `.prod()` method for symbolic expressions.
* A public `product()` function (I wanted to nmae it `prod`, but this clashes irreconciliably with the existing `prod` function for lists and others. I you see how to implement this, you're welcome...).

Passes `ptestlong` with the usual transient `sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py` failure, which is transient.

==> `needs_review`

As of the day before yesterday, the patchbots started giving an error in building g2fx that I don't understand a bit...

Ca some kind sould enlighten me on the possible causes (and possible remedies ?)

some comments:
- the `(optional) use Giac` should be just `use Giac`
- ``'mathematica'`` - (optional) use Mathematica is missing
- add a SEEALSO block pointing to the new `symbolic_product` in the top level `prod` (`misc_c.pyx`)

if you don't mind, i can add these minor things myself and review asap.

Indeed : giac is now standard...

> - ``'mathematica'`` - (optional) use Mathematica is missing

Indeed.

But I'm not so sure : the Mathematica interface has other (serious) problems, that can be triggered also in sums and products. This, IMHO, is a distinct problem, and should be fixed by someone knowing what it does with Mathematica (I don't...). 

Is it reasonable do document a (good) way to use a (flaky) interface ? I let you judge...

> - add a SEEALSO block pointing to the new `symbolic_product` in the top level `prod` (`misc_c.pyx`)

Right... 

> if you don't mind, i can add these minor things myself and review asap. 


Please go ahead ! Do you need me to review your review ?

done. for `mathematica` unfortunately i also don't have it so cannot test, but i do think it's good to mention as a valid option.

i'm having an issue with the `hold` option:


```
sage: k, n = var('k, n')
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_product(k, k, 1, n)
factorial(n)
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_product(k, k, 1, n, hold=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-1fc22673b8c7> in <module>()
----> 1 sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_product(k, k, Integer(1), n, hold=True)

/Users/forets/sage-src/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/calculus/calculus.pyc in symbolic_product(expression, v, a, b, algorithm, hold)
    868
    869     if hold == True:
--> 870         from sage.functions.other import symbolic_prod as sprod
    871         return sprod(expression, v, a, b)
    872

ImportError: cannot import name symbolic_prod
```


let me fix it by changing `symbolic_prod` to `symbolic_product` in line 870

We are suppose to be supporting an interface to Mathematica, so I think we should document it. Doing so will both increase our user base and help find bugs from people using said interface.

symbolic product works and html doc builds, tests in relevant modules pass.
