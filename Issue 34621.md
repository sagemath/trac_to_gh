So no more sdist specific code in setup.py so simplification and make sure stuff is properly included in the manifest.

I am wondering if it is possible to first use a global include and then prune some of the files that are collected by that global include. I am just thinking we should explicitly list as few files as we can. It is a risk, because someone will forget to include them in the manifest when they create a new one - or delete one.

Yes, that's what the MANIFEST.in is doing. We do have to distinguish between the Cython-generated C/C++ files and actual C/C++ source files. Adding new such files is a relatively rare event

I am very much in automation these days. While it is relatively short, maintaining this list by hand is a hazard. Which is why this ticket add 3 explicit files to `MANIFEST.in`. I am going to fill that under ideas to develop.

For the rest it looks good to me but I see #34859 has not been reviewed yet.
