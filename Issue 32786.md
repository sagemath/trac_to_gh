but of course I'm just now noticing that the `--disable-cvxopt` branch I was so careful to add doesn't work at all.

Can you use `set_random_seed()` within a sage session to reproduce the failing test manually? And then let us know what the matrix is? The problem may be somewhere else entirely.

For posterity wrt the aarch64 situation: It seems like this is just GSL's normal behavior for complex numbers. For a while, GSL failed its own test suite on non-x86 archs (see https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2018-04/msg00000.html, https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2019-08/msg00006.html), and this was fixed by increasing the testsuite tolerance (if I understand correctly). In Sage, this leads to the following:

```
sage: n = 2
....: A = matrix.random(CDF, n, sparse=True)
....: I = matrix.identity(CDF, n, sparse=True)
....: B = A*A.conjugate_transpose() + I
sage: B.is_hermitian()
False
sage: A
[ 0.06399592195624204 + 0.9759063101371459*I   -0.6225535439278806 - 0.936748411534233*I]
[0.7034249681768727 + 0.025995399537690478*I   -0.530996200711682 - 0.9527074580528845*I]
sage: A.conjugate_transpose()
[ 0.06399592195624204 - 0.9759063101371459*I 0.7034249681768727 - 0.025995399537690478*I]
[  -0.6225535439278806 + 0.936748411534233*I   -0.530996200711682 + 0.9527074580528845*I]
sage: A[0,0] * A.conjugate_transpose()[0,0]
0.9564886041925287 + 2.9640823241848024e-19*I
```

I can't reproduce this particular problem on amd64, but I am happy the main problem was caught so quickly. Thanks for the speedy diagnosis and fix!
