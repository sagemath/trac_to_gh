CC:  @jplab @laisrast

To make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron` we change the following names.

`length_Hrepr` -> `n_Hrepresentation`
`length_Vrepr` -> `n_Vrepresentation`

In `FaceIterator`:
`length_atom_repr` -> `n_atom_rep` (note that #28608 changes `repr` to `rep`)

In `CombinatorialFace`:
`length_Vrepresentation` -> `n_ambient_Vrepresentation`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28614
