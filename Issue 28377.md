# Issue 28377: CombinatorialPolyhedron: length_* to n_*

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28614

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-16 07:14:49

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

To make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron` we change the following names.

`length_Hrepr` -> `n_Hrepresentation`
`length_Vrepr` -> `n_Vrepresentation`

In `FaceIterator`:
`length_atom_repr` -> `n_atom_rep` (note that #28608 changes `repr` to `rep`)

In `CombinatorialFace`:
`length_Vrepresentation` -> `n_ambient_Vrepresentation`

Actually due to merge conflict, this ticket depends on #28606 as well.

do not import anything `from __future__` in pyx files

otherwise, looks good
