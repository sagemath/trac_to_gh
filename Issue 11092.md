# Issue 11092: sage/combinat/iet/strata.py is the last place in sage to use the deprecated type.__cmp__ operator, easy fix.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11264

type.__cmp__ has been removed from python-2.6.5 and later and is only used in one place in sage. It can be safely replaced by cmp. This will be needed to upgrade python.
