Hi, I think there has to be a change in line 77 here :
https://github.com/sagemath/documentation/blob/gh-pages/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/hyperbolicity.html

Should I send a PR on Github ?

No, all changes go through this trac system here. The documentation is embedded into SageMath's code and therefore it requires a change in the source code of the software. That way, we have doctests, etc.

Compare the website you referenced with

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/graphs/hyperbolicity.pyx

oh, sorry. It was simpler than that.. I was talking about the field here in trac. Let me do this for you.

Oh, that escaped my sight. I am new to this development environment (trac server), I am actually a normal user of Sage. Sage has helped me at times, so I thought it is time to return back the favor, so I am here around fixing small issues !
