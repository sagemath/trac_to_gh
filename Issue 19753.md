I'd still add that the description in the doc deviates from the reference, otherwise it's not fair to anyone who'd decide to dig it all up.

To be honest I don't even know where that construction is in the paper. I see 'sigma' being defined differently alright, but I don't see the rest of the construction.

Is this ready to go ?

Maybe there is a typo "with zer diagonal" ?

Please use the `:doi:` role (same syntax as `:trac:`) for the doi link

once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf if you want
