# Issue 12011: absolute and relative norm functions for number field elements

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: MvanBeek

Original creation time: 2011-12-18 16:34:17

Assignee: tbd

Although number_field_element.pyx has a norm method, it does not have absolute_norm() and relative_norm(). This would be a useful shorthand to have.

I've applied the patch and did all the tests for rings (all passed). I've also done some computation of my own. I've looked at the code and it looks fine. I've built the documentation and it looks fine.

Monique, you should put a proper commit message to your patch.  If you use Mercurial queues (which you do), this can be done using

```
hg qrefresh -e
```

and then

```
hg export tip
```

as usual.

Add 12183_5.patch without any of the previous patches. Made the code of Monique a bit shorter and added a commit.

The patch needs a proper commit message (use `hg qrefresh -e` for that).

The patch should also be rebased to sage-5.12.beta2.

The patch doesn't actually need rebasing. The problem here is that Michiel made a new patch [attachment:12183_5.patch], and Angelos gave a positive review to that patch, but the ticket description still said "apply [attachment:12183.3.patch]". I have corrected the ticket description, and verified that the latest patch does have a proper commit message and applies without fuzz to the latest 5.12.beta2.
