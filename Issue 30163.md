Keywords: Finite topological spaces

This ticket provides a class for finite topological spaces and methods dealing with properties in general topology. It is expected to create a second ticket to add algebraic topology properties.

I have added the file finite_topological_spaces.py in ~/sage/src/sage/homology. I think this is a correct place to put it because different methods dealing with homotopy types and weak homotopy types will be added in next commits, but the discussion is open and I accept other suggestions in order to put it in the correct place.

The issue is that these sets may print in different orders, and I think it's more or less random.

By the way, it's better to say `if E is None` instead of `if E == None`.

Thanks for the suggestions, I have changed the files in order to include the improvements.

I see... I think it depends on the implementation of sets in [SageMath](SageMath), do I have to impose an specific order for printing or it is not necessary?

One place that violates this is in the docstrings. Don't work too hard to get the doctests under 80 characters, but the paragraphs of text should satisfy this.\n- I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on. The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement) says that `assert` statements should be used for debugging.

My apologies for the delay, I am going to try working on this ticket. Some style comments:
- Preferred Sage style is to keep lines under 80 characters when possible. One place that violates this is in the docstrings. Don't work too hard to get the doctests under 80 characters, but the paragraphs of text should satisfy this.
- I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on. The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement) says that `assert` statements should be used for debugging. (I think these statements are currently used throughout the Sage library, and maybe we should start a campaign to eliminate them. In the meantime, we shouldn't add more.)
- I'm getting doctest failures of the form `cannot import name '__convertarray__' from ...`. I do not have Kenzo installed; I think those doctests should be marked `optional - kenzo`. See below for some fixes, although I may have been too aggressive in applying the tags.
- I'm getting other doctest failures from `E = random.sample(X, k)` with a deprecation warning:

```
    DeprecationWarning: Sampling from a set deprecated
    since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.
```

- The documentation isn't building, but I think I've fixed that. See below.

> - Preferred Sage style is to keep lines under 80 characters when possible. One place that violates this is in the docstrings. Don't work too hard to get the doctests under 80 characters, but the paragraphs of text should satisfy this.

I tried my best to do it, I have shortened the lines that didn't satisfy the rule.

> - I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on.

(I think these statements are currently used throughout the Sage library, and maybe we should start a campaign to eliminate them. In the meantime, we shouldn't add more.)

The `assert` statements have been completely changed to conditional statements.

> - I'm getting doctest failures of the form `cannot import name '__convertarray__' from ...`. I do not have Kenzo installed; I think those doctests should be marked `optional - kenzo`. See below for some fixes, although I may have been too aggressive in applying the tags.

The `optional - kenzo` mark has been added to the required lines. Also, some functions have been added directly to `src/sage/interfaces.kenzo.py`.

> - I'm getting other doctest failures from `E = random.sample(X, k)` with a deprecation warning:

I have changed "sampling from a set `X`" by "sampling from a `list(X)`" in order to fix these warnings.

I think the attribute `T.elements()` has no a good name, I think I should change it to `T.topogenous_sorting()` or something like that. If the user want to obtain the set of elements of the space, the attribute `T.underlying_set()` could be the best option.

> Is there a ticket for the new Kenzo?

The Trac query for [tickets whose summary includes "kenzo"](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~kenzo)
reveals:

- #29617: Support system installations of ECL and fix the kenzo SPKG build

which upgrades from Kenzo 1.1.9 to Kenzo 1.1.10
and udates the "upstream" info to point to

- https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo

It got positive review in early April 2021,
and was rebased on 9.4.beta0 in late May 2021.

Other Kenzo sources seem more outdated, mentioning only Kenzo 1.1.7:

- the [homepage](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/)
  and former [Kenzo GitHub repo](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo)
  and its [releases page](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo/releases)
  and [wiki](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo/wiki).

Thankfully,
