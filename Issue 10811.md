Hi Volker,

The patch is quite easy, as `preimage_cones` were already implemented, but in order to make everything shiny it would be nice to improve handling of degenerate cases. For this I need to resolve the situation with trivial fans, namely: is an empty set a fan, or it must include at least the origin? Fulton and Cox-Little-Schenck don't mention it explicitly, but from the point of view of nice correspondence to toric varieties it seems that completely empty fans should be prohibited as they seem to correspond to empty varieties, but then they don't really contain a torus.

Right now it is possible in Sage to create a fan without cones, I propose to automatically add the origin of the provided lattice in this case and treat it as the generating cone. Any objections?

Regarding `preimage_fans(cone)` it would imply that usually it is generated by `preimage_cones(cone)`, but some of them maybe unnecessary for generation (e.g. in the case of blow-up, described in the documentation), i.e. generating cones of `preimage_fan(cone)` are a subset of `preimage_cones(cone)`. However, if `preimage_cones(cone)` is empty, then `preimage_fan(cone)` will have an "extra" generating cone, namely the origin.

After some thinking, I have decided to make `kernel_fan` live in the kernel sublattice. The drawback is that currently sublattices don't work extremely well as ambient ones for cones and fans, but that should eventually change. I have made some changes improving the situation, but dual objects still don't work and so one cannot ask for cones of this kernel fan (the doctest is marked as not tested). I propose to include it nevertheless, since the constructed fan is still correct and will be completely functional once other part are improved. (And the "old" version is still available as explicit `preimage_fan` of the origin.)

I have also tweaked the fan constructor a little to ensure adding at least the origin cone and allowing one to specify the fan lattice which is different then cone lattices, as long as it is possible to do the conversion:

```
sage: P2 = toric_varieties.P2()
sage: f = P2.fan()
sage: f
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
sage: Fan(f.generating_cones())                             
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice N
sage: Fan(f.generating_cones(), lattice=f.lattice().dual())
Rational polyhedral fan in 2-d lattice M
```

If the lattice is not given explicitly, no conversion will be made and all cones must belong to the same lattice. But giving the lattice explicitly may be quite handy for switching between lattices/sublattices/quotients and the above example with "switching to dual" is sometimes used when one wants to compare fans of polar polytopes and think of them as fans in the same lattice.

Ready for review!

I am having second thoughts about preimage fans: shouldn't they be full fans that are mapped into a given cone? Rather then be generated by cones whose relative interior is mapped into the relative interior of the given one. I am convinced now that `preimage_cones` does the correct thing, but for `preimage_fan` it seems a bit weird.

The reason why I didn't think enough about it before is that for the moment I only needed the kernel fan where both approaches give the same result.
