Keywords: sage-combinat, equality, inheritance

I think one should always at least one of `__ne__` and `__cmp__` on a class when one defines `__eq__`, unless one really wants to have `!=` to behave differently from the negation of `==` (or one is happy with the `__ne__` inherited from the superclass; but then why would one redefine `__eq__` to begin with?):


```
sage: ContreTableaux(4) == ContreTableaux(4)
True
sage: ContreTableaux(4) != ContreTableaux(4)
True
```


or also (here the `!=` is inherited from `CombinatorialObject`):


```
sage: Core([1,1],3) != Core([1,1],4)
False
sage: Core([1,1],3) == Core([1,1],4)
False
```


Here is a result of searching for this antipattern in the sage/combinat subfolder:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/lca1yfw1qsz6ycy/ne.txt
Some of these do define `__cmp__`, but redefining `__ne__` might lead to a speedup, so I kept them in the file even if these are not bugs per se.

Should we just fix them all robotically?

Thanks for investigating this! It's certainly annoying.

In principle TestSuite includes some checks about this. So it would be interesting to see whether TestSuite was run on those failing examples.

Whenever possible, I would vote for including a trivial implementation of `__ne__` by negation of `__eq__` as high up in the class hierarchy (e.g. `CombinatorialObject`) to minimize the change and make it more likely for future classes to not fall in the trap.

On the parent. The methods `_test_elements_eq` and friends from the Sets.ParentMethods category
does this kind of checks, and it will be interesting to see if the heuristics there are enough to catch some or all of what you detected. If not, it can be a good occasion to invent new heuristics :-)

+1.

> This wouldn't, however, solve all the issues here. For example, `ContreTableaux` only inherits from `Parent` (BTW: why does `ContreTableaux.category()` raise a TypeError?), while `CombinatorialSpecies` inherits from `SageObject`, etc.

Yup. I have always been of the opinion that SageObject should really be handling this for us; but if I recall correctly there are some Python versus Cython classes issues, since the protocol varies slightly from one to the other.

Hmm, there actually *is* a noticeable amount of CombinatorialObjects which redefine neither `__eq__` nor `__ne__` (tableaux, permutations, Dyck words, partition tuples, ...), so we might want to check for speed regressions. But they'll probably be insubstantial (for most combinatorial operations, there should be no need to check for inequality).

Where can I learn how to use clonable lists?

`sage.structure.list_clone?`

also available as:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/structure/sage/structure/list_clone.html

See in particular the demo examples.

`TestSuite(parent(c)).run()`

Good to know.

So yes, this can be closed, even for the classes that have not implemented a `__ne__`.
