Is there any chance [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-packaging/CtiTkXDxWF0) test error may be caused by the cysignals upgrade? It occurred shortly after I committed the cysignals 1.8.0 update (on 2018-12-15). Since cysignals is involved and I don't see any other mention of this error, it seems likely that the bug was introduced by this update.

[The build server has recovered by now](https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixpkgs.sage.x86_64-linux), so the error is not reproduceable.

The code in cysignals dealing with dying processes has not changed in the latest upgrade. So I don't see any immediate reason why this upgrade would cause that Nix testing error.

It seems like a pretty big coincidence that this happened on the second rebuild after the cysignals update while it was never reported before. But it may be just that, a coincidence.

See my reply in sage-packaging: it really was just a coincidence

It turns out that a few tweaks were needed to cysignals to support #24986, leading to version 1.8.1
