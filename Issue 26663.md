Is there any chance [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-packaging/CtiTkXDxWF0) test error may be caused by the cysignals upgrade? It occurred shortly after I committed the cysignals 1.8.0 update (on 2018-12-15). Since cysignals is involved and I don't see any other mention of this error, it seems likely that the bug was introduced by this update.

[The build server has recovered by now](https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk-combined/nixpkgs.sage.x86_64-linux), so the error is not reproduceable.
