# Issue 25213: Expose sign formula for hypergeometric motives

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: hypergeometric motives, functional equation

The function computing the Euler factors of a hypergeometric motive has embedded in it a formula (imported from Magma) for the sign of the functional equation. The goal of this ticket is to expose this formula as a separate method.

Well. Please use `return sign` with no parentheses. Once done, you can set to positive.

While I was at it, I found a few other places that had `return(x)` where x is a simple expression and changed them all to `return x`. (There is one of the form `return(x-y)` which I left alone.)
