Keywords: schemes, Jacobian

This shouldn't return an error:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
sage: X = P.subscheme([])
sage: X.Jacobian_matrix() # This works
[]
sage: X.Jacobian() #This doesn't
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'reduce'
```

I think the mathematically correct answer is that X.Jacobian() should again equal X (i.e., P viewed as a closed subscheme of itself). However, this is not consistent with the definition in the docstring:

```
  * the `d\times d` minors of the Jacobian matrix, where `d` is
    the :meth:`codimension` of the algebraic scheme, and

  * the defining polynomials of the algebraic scheme. Note that
    some authors do not include these in the definition of the
    Jacobian ideal. An example of a reference that does include
    the defining equations is [LazarsfeldJacobian].
```

In this case d=0, and the unique 0 by 0 minor of any matrix (empty or not) is equal to 1.

In fact, the problem seems to be that the 0 by 0 minor of a matrix is returned as 1 in the ring of integers, not the base ring of the matrix. Retitled and reclassified accordingly.

All done. Also, I noticed that my fix wasn't actually sufficient: in `algebraic_scheme`, the `Jacobian_matrix()` method also needs to be forced to produce a matrix in the correct ring. The last commit does this.
