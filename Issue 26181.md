Doesn't work on Python 3 since `int` cannot be safely cast to a C `long`.

A hint for next time: it would have been better to just use the coercion framework for this: `__pow__` should be replaced by `_pow_` or `_pow_int`.

To this day I still don't have a solid understanding of how the coercion framework works and when to use `_pow_` versus `__pow__` for example.  

In this case it was fixing an already existing `__pow__` but if you think this should be changed (and I don't disagree; I just don't know why) perhaps there should be a ticket for that.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
