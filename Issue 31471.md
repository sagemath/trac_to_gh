ok, looks good

maybe `Stack ``self`` on top of ``other``.` should become 
`Stack ``self`` on top of ``bottom``.`

if you agree, once done, you can set to positive

Thank you. I made one other minor change: I removed the column equality check since that is done in the `stack()` method and other `_stack_impl` methods make the same assumption. Could you please check it?
