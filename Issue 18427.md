Hey Amy and Franco,

You will need to rebase this off the latest `develop` and make sure all functions have doctests (some don't have docstrings). I would also just move the `_register_coercion_` method into the `__init__` (so really you're removing that method). Also the `_to_complete_on_generator` has a misaligned docstring. I'd also change the `if n == 0 or n == 1:` to `if n <= 1`.

I would also use:

```python
def _from_complete_on_basis(self, I):
    n = I.size()
    m = self._complete_to_zassenhaus_transition_matrix(n).invers()
    C = Compositions(n)
    i = C.rank(I)    # this is typically faster than list(C).index(I)
    return self._from_dict({comp: m[i,j] for j,comp in enumerate(C)})
```

Actually, since you only use the inverses, I would cache the inverse matrices instead.

On a more optimization point (which is not necessary to handle now):

```python
for partition in Partitions(n):
    if len(partition) > 1:
        ...
```

I would instead do this:

```python
P = Partitions(6)
it = iter(P)
it.next()
for p in it:
    ...
```

If you really wanted to go crazy with optimization, I'd use

```python
from sage.combinat.partitions import ZS1_iterator
it = ZS1_iterator(n)
it.next()
for p in it:
    d = {}
    for part in self:
        d[part] = d.get(part, 0) + 1
    coeff = prod(factorial(d[e]) for e in d)
    ...
```

Yet as I said, that's going crazy.

It will probably run faster if you register algebra_morphisms (to and from the complete) as coercions rather than module morphisms.  I made this change in #18415 for a number of the multiplicative bases so you can use that as a model.  There have also been a number of changes in #18447 so it is best (as Travis suggested) if you rebase this off the development branch.

Are you guys working on this right now or should I review?

Hello Darij, I would to review until the comments by Travis and Mike are addressed. I've set this to "needs work".

Amy, did you want to address these?

The proposed changes are slightly beyond what I know how to do. Would you have time to help me with them when I'm back in Montreal? Or perhaps Travis, Mike or some other experts can lend me a hand during FPSAC? Thanks.

I'm guessing it is the rebasing that is giving you trouble, right? I can walk you through the changes off-list. Also I will be at FPSAC, so we can figure out a meeting time for that too.

I suggest to use your time more strategically/productively while you are at FPSAC. We can work on this when you get back.

two methods or functions are lacking doctests, see patchbot report

I've done the remaining polish for this. It would be great if we could get this in.

Review committed (new branch!). But can't test, since Sage is compiling (again...).

My sage is broken ("ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20')") and I don't know the correct way to import "next" from future, so someone else will need to fix this :(


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-02-21 20:28:21

The fix is very simple: just replace `it.next()` by `next(it)`.


---

Comment by darij created at 2017-02-21 20:30:33

Oh, without any extra imports? That's neat, will do so.
