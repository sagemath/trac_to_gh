#19290 documented two issues. This ticket is to deal with the second issue: PartitionMatroid should accept empty partitions.


```
sage: from sage.matroids.advanced import *
sage: M = PartitionMatroid([])
```

currently gives an error, but should return a matroid on 0 elements.

Just change `if len(P2) != 0:` to `if P2:` (the latter is faster) and full author name. You can set a positive review on my behalf after.
