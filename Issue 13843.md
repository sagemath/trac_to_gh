# Issue 13843: AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'conjugate'

Issue created by migration from Trac.

In sage 5.5 I see the following behaviour:


```
sage: Matrix(AA, [This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)).gram_schmidt()
[…]
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'conjugate'
sage: AA(1).conjugate()
[…]
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'conjugate'
sage: conjugate(AA(1))
1
```


So I'd say either gram_schmidt (or its backends) should be modified to use the `conjugate` function instead of the `conjugate` method. Or the base class for real algebraic numbers should be changed to provide that method. The latter would be more likely to resolve issues similar to this one, in existing and future code, shipped with sage or written by third parties. The former might help for other fields which don't support a `conjugate` method either.

Changing keywords from "" to "conjugate, AlgebraicReal".

The algebraic reals should definitely have a conjugate method, so I've added that. I also added a doctest in gram_schmidt to test that it now works with algebraic reals (I used the example for QQbar that only has integers and doing the computation with algebraic reals instead of QQbar is in fact faster!).
