# Issue 23197: move subscheme code to respective folders

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23434

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2017-07-14 13:25:00

CC:  rlmiller

The algebraic_scheme.py file in the schemes folder currently contains the code for all types of subschemes (affine, projective, products of projective space, toric). This makes the file quite large. This ticket splits the subscheme functionality by type into their respective folders; i.e. affine subscheme functionality will now live at affine/affine_subscheme.py

There is no functionality change with the ticket, just a re-organization and some minor doc cleanup.

setting to needs-review so the patch-bot picks it up. All tests passed for me locally and the docs build, I just want to be sure I didn't miss an import/reference somewhere.

Looks like it passed the patchbot before I updated it to rc2. So this is actually ready review now.

Fixed the merge conflict. Seems there was a minor change in projective subschemes

If you can produce a fixed branch just after a beta release I can merge that first...

I can do that, but it may not be the next beta. I'm traveling the next 10 days or so.

Changing priority from minor to major.


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2017-09-22 19:07:46

I had to make a couple non-trivial changes to projective_subscheme.py as well as a couple imports in dynamical systems to get the interaction between subschemes and dynamical systems correct.  Sorry, but those changes are mixed into the merge. You'll need to look at the diff on those specific files to see them.


Switching the priority to major as this is a significant change that keeps getting conflicted with other small changes.
