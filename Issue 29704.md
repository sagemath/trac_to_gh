This package would package at least the following:
- `sage.repl` (and hence depends on on basic rings such as `ZZ`, hence on `sage-categories` (#29865))
- `sage.doctest` (which depends on `sage.repl`)
- `sage.misc.sage_input`
- ??

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29941
