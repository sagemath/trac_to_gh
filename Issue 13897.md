The dependency on #14772 is some fuzz due to editing of cython files in symmetrica.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-07-10 08:19:29

There is a minor dependency in `integer_vector_weighted.py` from #13589.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-07-18 11:21:16

Removed fuzz caused by #14907 (I think).


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-07-19 10:59:20

I also fixed the error with `SkewTableau.to_chain()`.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-07-19 13:24:43

Fixed corner case of `to_chain()`. Thanks for catching that Mike.

1) Why does this depend on #14907?

2) 

```
sage -t devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/ribbon_tableau.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/ribbon_tableau.py", line 201, in sage.combinat.ribbon_tableau.RibbonTableaux

This seems to be a bug with the doctesting framework, which thinks of empty lines as EOM. Just replacing "print" by "print 'some_nonempty_string'" does the trick.

Fixed the above (all one has to do was add `<BLANKLINE>`) and added the comment that Arthur and I talked about via email.

The doctest works now; positive review then?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-07-20 09:46:09

Arthur had wanted me to change some documentation, so he'll set the positive review once he's looked that over.

Travis, 
    No problem. Thanks for your help.

There is fuzz applying to 5.11.beta3


```
applying trac_14101-remove_cc_skew-ts.patch
patching file sage/combinat/tableau.py
Hunk #10 succeeded at 1486 with fuzz 2 (offset -52 lines).
now at: trac_14101-remove_cc_skew-ts.patch
```


None of the dependencies touch tableau.py. Can you please rebase to see if that will fix the fuzz?

Thanks,
Jeff

Try it with #7983. I'm not getting any fuzz (in the combinat queue).


---

Comment by jferreira created at 2013-07-23 10:03:35

Travis,

Yes that worked. It now applies without any fuzz. Thanks.

I get a warning when building the doc:


```
[combinat ] /Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/ribbon_tableau.py:docstring of sage.combinat.ribbon_tableau.RibbonTableau:23: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.

Trivial rebase over changes in `sources.py` in #14772.
