CC:  egourgoulhon tscrim

We introduce a parent class for `Components`, called `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` (although it won't be a module yet as of this ticket). 

We move symmetry attributes, frame, and output formatter there.

This is a step toward #30307.

The basis is fixed, and a `Components` instance does not even know which indices are covariant and which are contravariant positions, so I don't think any claims how things transform are made.

This module would be just like a `FreeModule` or a `MatrixSpace`. Note that a matrix also does not know how it should transform - whether as the matrix of a linear map or as the matrix of a quadratic form.

To add to this, the information how things transform is stored in the morphism from the `TensorFreeModule` to the `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis`, not in the module.

In the context of some of the other recent tickets: This morphism is exactly the `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis` (#34427).

Indeed, but the very name `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` suggests that we are dealing with the components of a tensor on a free module, while the connection coefficients are no such thing. In particular, the set of affine connections on a given manifold is usually not endowed with a module structure: there is no meaning in adding two affine connections, and the multiplication by an element of the (potential) base ring --- the algebra of smooth scalar fields, would not lead to another affine connection.

It would be worthwhile to think about whether we should make it possible to create a `MatrixSpace` or `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` in a larger category than `ModulesWithBasis`, perhaps just `Sets`, and in that case use an element class that does not provide the module operations (`_add_`, `_lmul_` etc.)

It looks less severe here than in #30245: as you pointed out, the connection coefficients in a given basis can be considered as elements of a tensor module and one can performed module operations of them (after all, the class `Components` defines `__add__` and `__rmul__`), simply these operations do not correspond to operations on the connections themselves, so that they will not be used in an actual code.

A possible concern about moving to the `Parent/Element` scheme is about the efficiency with respect to the pure array-like structure. The class `Components` is at the root of the calculus on manifolds and one should make sure that introducing parents does now yield some significant slow down. But this is something we can check and benchmark.

Ah I see, you let the parent handle the frames. Then, at least mathematically, it should be fine.

But from the programming viewpoint I see a problem with `UniqueRepresentation`.
