CC:  egourgoulhon tscrim

We introduce a parent class for `Components`, called `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` (although it won't be a module yet as of this ticket). 

We move symmetry attributes, frame, and output formatter there.

This is a step toward #30307.

I am not convinced about the tensor module structure for the parent, because, in some cases, `Components` is used to store data that do not behave as tensor components under a change of basis, namely the [coefficients of an affine connection](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/affine_connection.html#sage.manifolds.differentiable.affine_connection.AffineConnection.coef) on a differentiable manifold.

The basis is fixed, and a `Components` instance does not even know which indices are covariant and which are contravariant positions, so I don't think any claims how things transform are made.

This module would be just like a `FreeModule` or a `MatrixSpace`. Note that a matrix also does not know how it should transform - whether as the matrix of a linear map or as the matrix of a quadratic form.

To add to this, the information how things transform is stored in the morphism from the `TensorFreeModule` to the `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis`, not in the module.

In the context of some of the other recent tickets: This morphism is exactly the `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis` (#34427).

Indeed, but the very name `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` suggests that we are dealing with the components of a tensor on a free module, while the connection coefficients are no such thing. In particular, the set of affine connections on a given manifold is usually not endowed with a module structure: there is no meaning in adding two affine connections, and the multiplication by an element of the (potential) base ring --- the algebra of smooth scalar fields, would not lead to another affine connection.

It would be worthwhile to think about whether we should make it possible to create a `MatrixSpace` or `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` in a larger category than `ModulesWithBasis`, perhaps just `Sets`, and in that case use an element class that does not provide the module operations (`_add_`, `_lmul_` etc.)

A possible concern about moving to the `Parent/Element` scheme is about the efficiency with respect to the pure array-like structure.

Ah I see, you let the parent handle the frames. Then, at least mathematically, it should be fine.

But from the programming viewpoint I see a problem with `UniqueRepresentation`.
