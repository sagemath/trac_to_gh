# Issue 33877: PowerSeriesRing errors out on quotient ring of polynomials over fields like CC or AA

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34114

Original creator: @maxale

Original creation time: 2022-07-04 16:32:35

The following code produces a bunch of errors:


```
P.<x,w> = PolynomialRing(CC)
R = P.quotient_ring([x*w-1])
S.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(R)
```


It also errors out if `CC` is replaced with `AA`, but it works fine if it's replaced with `QQ`.

works fine for me in 9.7.beta3. Which version of sage do you use ?

I'm using Sage 9.6. The issue is also reproducible in https://sagecell.sagemath.org/

I see the same issue in [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.7.rc0
