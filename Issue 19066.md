# Issue 19066: Spurious docstring reference to polyhedron.interior_point()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19303

The docstring of `polyhedron.center()` refers to `polyhedron.interior_point()`, which does not exist. The correct function name is `polyhedron.representative_point()`. The branch fixes this.
