A lot of conflicts:

I don't have `product` in my version of Sage, but by replacing that line with

```
sage: values = [S(list(t)) for t in cartesian_product([[0,1/2,1,2],] * 5)]
```

I was able to reproduce the issue. I need a fix for this in order to deal with hashes of ideals; see #21297.

To make this more specific, in case this helps to chase this down:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: u = 2*t^3 + t^2; v = t^3 + 2*t + 1
sage: hash(u), hash(v)
(29698519856292282, 29698519856292282)
```

The key bit of code is in the function `hash_c` (omitting some comments):

```
for i from 0<= i <= self.degree():
    if i == 1:
        # we delay the hashing until now to not waste it on a constant poly
        var_name_hash = hash(self._parent._names[0])
    c_hash = hash(self[i])
    if c_hash != 0:
        if i == 0:
            result += c_hash
        else:
            # Hash (self[i], generator, i) as a tuple according to the algorithm.
            result_mon = c_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ var_name_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ i
            result += result_mon
```

which seems just not to work at all. Probably a complete rethink is in order here.

Ping. Something has changed in the interim, as my example from comment:4 is no longer applicable:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]

```
sage: S.<t> = QQ[]
sage: from itertools import product
sage: values = [S(t) for t in product((0,1/2,1,2), repeat=5)]
sage: len(set(map(hash,values)))

Replying to [comment:13 kedlaya]:
> Ping. Something has changed in the interim, as my example from comment:4 is no longer applicable:

This is because of the switch to Python 3, as strings (of the variable names) are hashed differently. With a Python 2 based Sage, it still behaves as before.

----

Also note that this

```
            # Hash (self[i], generator, i) as a tuple according to the algorithm.
            result_mon = c_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ var_name_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ i
            result += result_mon
```

essentially copies the implementation of [hashing of tuples in Python 2](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Objects/tupleobject.c#L344-L351). This was found to have many collisions on simple input and was replaced by a better hash function (xxHash) in Python 3.8; see [https://bugs.python.org/issue34751](https://bugs.python.org/issue34751).

This is probably difficult to avoid in general, since the hashing function for polynomials should incorporate the hash values of its coefficients. As the hash values of -1 and -2 are the same, all polynomials that differ only in terms of coefficients of -1 or -2 will necessarily have the same hash.

Cython automatically returns -2 if a hashing function returns -1, so to avoid this, one would have to add a separate hashing function (which Cython does not know about) to the elements of all coefficient rings – or find some other way of obtaining hash values of -1.

Nevertheless, the problem in the ticket description is independent from this -1/-2 issue, so hashing could still be improved a lot for polynomials not involving coefficients of -1.
