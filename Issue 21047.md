A lot of conflicts:

```
sage: S.<t> = QQ[]
sage: values = [S(t) for t in product((0,1/2,1,2), repeat=5)]
sage: len(set(map(hash,values)))
565
sage: len(values)
1024

I don't have `product` in my version of Sage, but by replacing that line with

```
sage: values = [S(list(t)) for t in cartesian_product([[0,1/2,1,2],] * 5)]
```

I was able to reproduce the issue. I need a fix for this in order to deal with hashes of ideals; see #21297.

To make this more specific, in case this helps to chase this down:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: u = 2*t^3 + t^2; v = t^3 + 2*t + 1
sage: hash(u), hash(v)
(29698519856292282, 29698519856292282)
```

The key bit of code is in the function `hash_c` (omitting some comments):

```
for i from 0<= i <= self.degree():
    if i == 1:
        # we delay the hashing until now to not waste it on a constant poly
        var_name_hash = hash(self._parent._names[0])
    c_hash = hash(self[i])
    if c_hash != 0:
        if i == 0:
            result += c_hash
        else:
            # Hash (self[i], generator, i) as a tuple according to the algorithm.
            result_mon = c_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ var_name_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ i
            result += result_mon
```

which seems just not to work at all. Probably a complete rethink is in order here.

Ping. Something has changed in the interim, as my example from comment:4 is no longer applicable:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]

(-7745487741690187698, -7745487741690187694)
```

but there is still an overall issue:

```
sage: S.<t> = QQ[]
sage: from itertools import product
sage: values = [S(t) for t in product((0,1/2,1,2), repeat=5)]
sage: len(set(map(hash,values)))
491
sage: len(values)
1024

Replying to [comment:13 kedlaya]:
> Ping. Something has changed in the interim, as my example from comment:4 is no longer applicable:

This is because of the switch to Python 3, as strings (of the variable names) are hashed differently. With a Python 2 based Sage, it still behaves as before.

----

Also note that this

```
            # Hash (self[i], generator, i) as a tuple according to the algorithm.
            result_mon = c_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ var_name_hash
            result_mon = (1000003 * result_mon) ^ i
            result += result_mon
```

essentially copies the implementation of [hashing of tuples in Python 2](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Objects/tupleobject.c#L344-L351). This was found to have many collisions on simple input and was replaced by a better hash function (xxHash) in Python 3.8; see [https://bugs.python.org/issue34751](https://bugs.python.org/issue34751). I guess we could just adopt this new tuple hash here to get better collision resistance.

This is probably difficult to avoid in general, since the hashing function for polynomials should incorporate the hash values of its coefficients. As the hash values of -1 and -2 are the same, all polynomials that differ only in terms of coefficients of -1 or -2 will necessarily have the same hash.

Cython automatically returns -2 if a hashing function returns -1, so to avoid this, one would have to add a separate hashing function (which Cython does not know about) to the elements of all coefficient rings – or find some other way of obtaining hash values of -1.

Nevertheless, the problem in the ticket description is independent from this -1/-2 issue, so hashing could still be improved a lot for polynomials not involving coefficients of -1.
