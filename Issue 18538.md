For some reason the wikipedia page about the truncated tetrahedron reports 120 automorphisms, and Sage computes 24. I will try to figure this out.

I have done the Icosidodecahedron in #18225...

Oh. Well, then we will update one of the two tickets once the other is merged. I don't care where it comes from, I just want to have it in Sage.

So what do we do?

We can:
1) Review+merge this one and adapt yours
2) Review+merge yours (much longer, as you have more code) and adapt mine

I have found a typo: in the line

```
+    The truncated icosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid with 12 vertices and
```

it should be "truncated tetrahedon".

And may I request a little pep8 effort ?

Thanks, fixed.

> And may I request a little pep8 effort ?

I have no idea what pep8 is about, and I do not intend to read (nor to follow) a document that tells me where I should put spaces before/after the '=' signs. Call me careless, but I find tickets #18904 way more important/urgent. Why people care more about spaces than things like that is beyond me.

ok, I understand.

Positive review.

I you have some time for a quick review, there is #10922 which is just about doc formatting.
