That code has minimum distance 3 so it can't correct two errors: it's not supposed to work. If you want to fuzz the generated code, say, you need to guard against the code having minimum distance less than 5. 

Note that the existing doctest *is* already fuzzy in that it injects a random error of weight two.

How could `r = Chan(c)` have injected an error of 3?

That is a bug, isn't it?

The existing doctest has only been tested for `set_random_seed(0)`. This is how the doctesting framework is currently set up, see #29935.

Sorry, I think I understand now.

This can be fixed in #29935 I guess. What fix do you suggest?

```diff
-D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 2)
+D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 1)
```

Or do you want the last line of the test to be random?

This is a strange test for the method, because it really is only applied in a situation, where it might or might not work.

Or is it just testing that the result of `D.decode_to_code` is well-defined?

> That code has minimum distance 3 so it can't correct two errors: it's not supposed to work.


The real question is: Why is it a doctest, if it is not supposed to work.

There is the doctest

```
sage: G = Matrix(GF(3),[
....: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1],
....: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
....: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
....: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1]])
sage: C = LinearCode(G)
sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 2)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), 2)
sage: c = C.random_element()
sage: r = Chan(c)
sage: c == D.decode_to_code(r)
True
```

in `src/sage/coding/linear_code.py`. Why is it there? What is supposed to illustrate?

Ah, you're right, that's a bug in the doctest! I had not looked up the doctest (you hadn't given me a file/linenumber), so I incorrectly assumed that you had fuzzied the code matrix.

Indeed, the code can only correct one error. One fix would be

```
sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 1)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), 1)
```

Then the channel always creates only one error, which is uniquely correctable with the code.

Best,
Johan

One more bug or wrong doctest:

This is a doctest in `src/sage/coding/grs_code.py` and it fails (for some reason in the doctest environment one needs a different random seed, but that shouldn't matter here):

```
sage: set_random_seed(164)
sage: F = GF(59)
sage: n, k = 40, 12
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: D = codes.decoders.GRSErrorErasureDecoder(C)
sage: c = C.random_element()
sage: n_era = randint(0, C.minimum_distance() - 2)
sage: Chan = channels.ErrorErasureChannel(C.ambient_space(), D.decoding_radius(n_era), n_era)
sage: y = Chan(c)
sage: D.connected_encoder().unencode(c) == D.decode_to_message(y)
```

For convenience:

```
