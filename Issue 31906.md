sage: f[1].sage()
```

does not return.

The reason is that there is the lack of a suitable equivalent for implicitly defined roots in the presence of extra variables.

So you are looking for a generalization of the function `sage.functions.other.complex_root_of`?

Yes, that's another way to put it.

I am not very familiar with the `SymbolicRing`, my `root_of` object does not really need to be able to do anything.  Of course, it would be nice if one could compute with it (e.g., plugging it into the polynomial could give zero, and similar simplifications), but that is not necessary.

Yes, that's how `complex_root_of` behaves - it stays unevaluated until forced to be numerically evaluated.  Currently it is only backed by a sympy function that only handles the case of polynomials with constant coefficients.
