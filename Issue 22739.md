CC:  dkrenn behackl

Keywords: characteristic polynomial, charpoly, linear algebra

I suggest to give a hint, in the wiki/doc, that sage returns the characteristic polynomial in this way:

det(xI-A)

But there is also another definition:

det(A-xI)

which returns the same polynomial, but with different signs.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22976
