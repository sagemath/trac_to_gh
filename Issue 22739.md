# Issue 22739: Characteristic polynomial documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22976

Original creator: daholzfeind

Original creation time: 2017-05-10 17:57:40

CC:  dkrenn behackl

Keywords: characteristic polynomial, charpoly, linear algebra

I suggest to give a hint, in the wiki/doc, that sage returns the characteristic polynomial in this way:

det(xI-A)

But there is also another definition:

det(A-xI)

which returns the same polynomial, but with different signs.

- Write a note-block in all charpoly-methods (not only for symbolic matrices)
- Maybe: Rephrase note block to "The characteristic polynomial is defined as..." to avoid repetition of the one-line description.
