# Issue 28796: Support minimal system Python version 3.6

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29033

With #29032 it is possible to use an existing Python 3.7 on the system to build and run Sage.  This is designed to work with Python 3.7 (and < 3.8) since that's what's currently used by sage-the-distribution and is best-tested.

However, it turns out an existing Python 3.6 can work just fine as the minimum Python version with a few small fixes (sage-the-distribution used Python 3.6 until last year, so the degree to which we diverged from supporting it was minimal).

I think this would be a nice-to-have, if not strictly necessary.  Maybe since Sage is less tested with 3.6, there could be a warning against using it.  But actually I'd be happy to keep running a Python 3.6 patchbot for a while until/unless it becomes untenable to support Python 3.6.

Related to the question of what Python versions are good is #26457 - "Do not depend on a patched Python"

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

This would need rebasing

Edited description to clarify that this is about the venv python3, not sage-system-python.

LGTM if those tests pass.

C.UTF-8 locale is a Debian-specific thing (and maybe Fedora). Please don't assume that it is available. On Arch, this causes lots (as in, one every other line in the compilation output) of warnings 

```
/bin/sh: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (C.UTF-8)
```

on another ticket, fixing docbuild on non-EN locales, someone using Arch complained that `LANG=C` causes a lot of warnings.

Sorry about that, I didn't realize that Gentoo's glibc was patched (the patches are in an unusual place). It looks like discussion is still ongoing for glibc:

https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-June/115224.html

Musl, on the other hand, already supports it I think?

https://wiki.musl-libc.org/functional-differences-from-glibc.html

In any case, we should probably revert to `C` in the meantime.

the locale issue is being dealt with on #30053

This has introduced an unfortunate bug related to a weird search order in `AC_PATH_PROGS_FEATURE_CHECK()`, which has the outer loop over `PATH` entries.
Thus, a python on the list `[python.foo python.baz ....]` of pythons that comes first in `PATH` and has all the features will be picked, not the first python on the list.

As modifying `PATH` to put the best python 1st might be error-prone (think about Conda, Homebrew, etc), this should be fixed.

This is of course an autoconf bug, too, as `AC_PATH_PROGS()` has a sane order, ie. its outer loop is over the list entries.

Follow up regarding `centos-7`:
> (because a dependency of python3 is too old):
>  - `centos-7` (3.6.8): `sqlite` is too old (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/743789990)

After #30559, `sqlite` is no longer the problem, but python3 is still not accepted on this system because of `zlib` -> `libpng`:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG zlib...
checking for inflateEnd in -lz... yes
checking zlib.h usability... yes
checking zlib.h presence... yes
checking for zlib.h... yes
checking for LIBPNG... no
checking for inflateValidate in -lz... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG zlib
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG libpng...
checking installing zlib? ... yes; install libpng as well
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG libpng
```

#31009 is taking care of this.
