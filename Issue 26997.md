# Issue 26997: Implement method `gap` of class `PermutationGroupElement` properly.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27234

Original creator: soehms

Original creation time: 2019-02-07 22:47:39

Keywords: libgap, permutation

This is a follow up ticket of #26750. In that ticket the method has been implemented as synonym of `_gap_`, since at that time libgap produced an error for large permutations.


```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 8.5, Release Date: 2018-12-22                     │
│ Using Python 2.7.15. Type "help()" for help.                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: P = PGU(8,2)
sage: p1, p2 = P.gens()
sage: libgap(p1)
python2: libgap.c:184: libgap_get_input: Assertion `strlen(libGAP_stdin_buffer) < length' failed.
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Aborted
```


This error has been fixed in 8.6.beta0. Therefore, we may have `gap` using `libgap`, right now!
