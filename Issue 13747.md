Keywords: local heights

Computing local heights uses functions that are only available when the base field is a NumberField, and not over the RationalField:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -36, 0])
sage: P = E(-3, 9)
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'places'
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height()
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'factor'
```

Note: at the moment this bug only shows up for non-torsion points because of a different bug (asking for local heights of torsion points always returns 0, which is in general incorrect).

For global heights over QQ we just call pari, but here I suggest that we call the local height functions implemented over number fields, which should be straightforward (but not completely trivial).   Must be based on #12509.  I should have time to do this next week if no-one else does it first.

A second comment, of a different kind:  how can it have happened and never been noticied that these related functions are all spelled wrong!  It is "archimedean" and not "archimedian" (think "Archimedes").

I don't think I will be able to resist correcting all these: about 24 occurrences including doctests.  Interestingly, in almost all places the word is spelled correctly in comments.  But should we just deprecate the old spelling?  I will consult sage-devel.

1. In line 2858 of the patched file I removed the division by K.degree() since that is 1.  This appeared to cut the time to doctest this file (with --long) by a few seconds, but that might have been a freak!

2. The global height function would now work without calling pari, hence with no special case needed for K==QQ.  Alternatively, we could easily add an "algorithm" parameter which could be either "sage" or "pari", with "pari" the default.

3. The non-arch. height has a parameter "weighted" which is not documented and should be, with doctests shoing its use.  Similarly with the is_minimal parameter.  And for consistency, surely the arch. height should also have a weighted parameter?

Sorry to be awkward;  mathematically the patch is certainly ok!

I have a second patch which deals only with (1) spelling corrrections, but no deprecation warning, (2) not dividing by K.degree() when it is 1.  I can add to that after this discussion, so will not upload it yet.

One easy solution would be to rely on the fact that K.places() returns the r_1 real embeddings followed by the r_2 complex embeddings:


```
r1, r2 = K.signature()
pl = K.places()
return (sum(self.archimedian_local_height(pl[i], prec) for i in range(r1))
        + 2 * sum(self.archimedian_local_height(pl[i], prec) for i in range(r1, r1 + r2))) / K.degree()

```
This leaves the job of distinguishing real and complex places to the NumberField code.  I just tested this and it appears to work

I agree with the spelling "archimedean".  (It is "archimedisch" in German and Dutch, and "archimédien" in French, but in these cases the "i" is part of the suffix.  Similarly, "Euclidean geometry" vs. "géométrie euclidienne" etc.)

If we are changing the spelling anyway, should we also write "non_archimedean_local_height" instead of "nonarchimedean_local_height" for readability?

I also noticed that "independent" is spelled "independant" in three places in the documentation.

Yes, the division by K.degree() should clearly be omitted.

As far as I can see the doctest verifying that the height equals the sum of the archimedean and non-archimedean local heights is not there yet, but there should certainly be one!

Yes, that sounds reasonable.

For non-arch. places the default, only relevant for a single place,  is weighted=False but when it adds up all the non-arch contributions it puts in the weightings as that is needed for the global height.  When weighting is False the local height is divided by the local degree.  Now for arch. places there is currently no weighting for individual places but we multiply by the local degree when adding up all the arch. contributions.  So I think that the consistent thing to do would be have weighting=True mean that at complex places the local height would be multiplied by 2, then again the total arch. contribution would be obtained by adding up the individual ones, weighted, but the default for a single place would be to have weighting=False and return the same as now.\n\nThe only thing about all that which puzzles me is that in the non-arch. case we divide by the local degree when weighting=False, while for arch. places we multiply by it when weighting=True.  This suggests to me that our conventions for the non-weighted local heights are inconsistent.  What do you think?",

It seems to me that the parameter "weighted" still makes sense if v = None: we should take the weighted sum of the local heights at all (non-)Archimedean places, and if weighted = False, we divide this sum by the degree of K.

Although it would certainly be good to have a parameter "weighted" for archimedean_local_height, the drawback is that we would again need to distinguish between real and complex places.  With the above way of eliminating the local_degree function, this is only avoided because we know which one it is because of our position in the list of all places.

The current conventions for the return values of (non)archimedian_local_height are consistent.

Peter, this is ready for review again.  It would be useful if you could review the changes I made before we ask a 3rd party;  I am sorry that because of the rebasing, by patch is not separate.

I did not add a weighted parameter to the archimedean height, for the reasons discussed.

I was about to add a normalised parameter to the global height, defaulting to True, but changed my mind since that would require having two different cached values, one normalised and one not, and I was lazy.

By the way, I did verify using independent code in eclib that the examples you added (local heights over QQ) give the correct values.
