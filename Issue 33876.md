This ticket makes it possible to draw Schlegel diagrams for 4-polytopes.
In particular, it implements the function `_tikz_4d_schlegel` of the class `geometry.polyhedron.plot.Projection` and makes it accessible for polytopes.

Example:

```
sage: C = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: Image = C.tikz([-0.0444,-0.6012,-0.7979], 173.25, 2, edge_color="blue", facet_color="black", vertex_color="green")
```

Great addition!

Last week, I worked on #33002. I think there will be a conflict between the two tickets. Which ticket should rebase on the other one? Does anybody of you want to review #33002?

I think this ticket should be rebased on your ticket. Thus I will switch this ticket to `needs_work`.
