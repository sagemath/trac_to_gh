The example in the ticket now gives:

It's "only" a hack that will give us bare symbolic bigoh. Realistic behaviour must be added on Pynac level, it's simply not there at the moment, if I understand correctly.

You see you cannot do arithmetics at all with symbolic series:

```
sage: s = SR(1/(1-x)).series(x,5); s
1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + Order(x^5)
sage: 2*s
2*(1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + Order(x^5))
```

For that reason it would be helpful if someone could at least review those tickets that deal with symbolic<-->dedicated ring conversion (#10846, #16203, #17402 and maybe #17400 and #17659). I cannot do this: I am the author 8P

Replying to [comment:8 rws]:
> It's "only" a hack that will give us bare symbolic bigoh. Realistic behaviour must be added on Pynac level, it's simply not there at the moment, if I understand correctly.
No, it's there but the user is asked to apply `series` again:

```
sage: (2*s).series(x,5)
2 + 2*x + 2*x^2 + 2*x^3 + 2*x^4 + Order(x^5)
```

So, it's not as bad as thought, and the patch could go in without having to fix a bigger issue.
