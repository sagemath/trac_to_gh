An upgrade to `primecount` 7.2 does not fix the problem.

Changing priority from blocker to major.

With #32894, which adds the conda package information, at least the `conda-forge-standard` configuration can be built, so we can defer this issue to the Sage 9.6 series.

```
wget https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/compare/v7.2...ab54277.patch 
```

`v7.2...ab54277.patch` applies to `primecount-7.2.tar.gz` just fine

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I have instead modified our build script

It might be better to backport the upstream patch for this one release. Not every compiler that supports `std=c++` will support `std=gnu++`.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-02-18 18:34:16

We are using this in other packages too. All compilers on all supported platforms support this.

Note that the upstream fix just disables 128 bit support when "std=c++.." is in use. So this is not what we want.

Needs review.

Yes, but this branch _already_ does,


```
sed "s/-std=c++/-std=gnu++/g"
```


and that could just as easily be


```
sed "s/-std=c++//g"
```


I was also thinking that this ticket was responsible for `-DWITH_POPCNT=OFF`, but it looks like that came from elsewhere. Nevertheless, there's an upstream fix for it that doesn't cause a performance degradation:

  https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/commit/b5a8286e5d3757bcc4b41c0ea6240f14403c379d

The `CMakeLists.txt` says "POPCNT instruction is very important for performance", so using the upstream patch would be an improvement over the unconditional OFF.

No, this doesn't work because the compiler without the -std flag may not be using a sufficiently new standard.

Yes, #33082.

https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33082#comment:4 explains that our fix also does not lead to performance degradation.

...when `__GNUC__` is defined. Now that there's a proper upstream fix, that too is unnecessarily compiler-specific. Moreover if we used the upstream patches, we'd be forced to remove these hacks for the next version of primecount; as it is, they may linger for years.

But okay. This isn't a ticket worth arguing over all night.
