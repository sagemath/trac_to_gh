# Issue 27972: Coding Theory Documentation Update

With the changes to the coding theory framework (#28073) and new additions (#21226), some of the bigger documentation files need changing. These are the thematic tutorials on [coding theory](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/coding_theory.html#coding-theory) and [creating a class in coding theory](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/structures_in_coding_theory.html#structures-in-coding-theory), as well as the [linear code construction documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/constructions/linear_codes.html). It might also be a good idea to add new tutorials on how to create a generic code/rank-metric code.

This ticket should depend on #28073 and #21226, not the other way around. I.e. we first need to green-light #28073 and #21226, and then we can make some updates to the tutorials.

Regarding the documentation in the linear code class, we should update that already in #28073 or #21226 only if it is very misleading. Consider the state of [SageMath](SageMath) if those two tickets were merged but this one wasn't: is the documentation in linear code then somewhat reasonable or completely wrong?

The documentation in `linear_code` should be completely reasonable, I changed it along the way as I was working on `AbstractCode`. The only issue are the bigger documentation files - maybe it would be best to temporarily take them out of Sage before they are edited so they don't confuse anyone?

I think it's OK to have such inconsistencies as long as they don't make it into a stable release, which probably won't happen before Sept.

I made necessary changes to the documentation in the coding module as well as some of the thematic tutorials.

For the thematic tutorials, I mostly tried to keep them as they were, correct things that were not relevant and add some new examples. I tried a few different things, but keeping in mind the audience for these tutorials, I decided to still keep the focus on linear codes over the Hamming metric. 

In `Coding Theory`, I just added a new section explaining that there are other classes supporting codes which are not necessarily linear and/or over the Hamming metric, and added an example of a rank metric code.

In `Structures in Coding Theory`, I kept the main example of the repetition code throughout the tutorial. I added a section on the structure of the abstract classes in the beginning and also added a small example of a non-linear code family.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
