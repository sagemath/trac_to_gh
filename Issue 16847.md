I not in favor of changing the `i not in self.index_set()` to raise an `IndexError` for two reasons:

1. This is user input into a function, not a key or an index of a sequence.
2. In the crystals code, there are related methods which do the check `i not in self.index_set()` which currently raise a `ValueError`. I think overall we should be consistent. If you feel that it should be an `IndexError`, we should change all of those as well.

I don't hold such a strong opinion on the first, but I'm more concerned about the second. The other changes are okay with me.
