In this ticket, I'd like to introduce vector valued forms with values in a vector bundle by using a generalization of the class `sage.tensor.modules.comp.Components` allowing its element to be more general elements (in this case differential forms). In a next step, a bundle connection is introduced having vector valued forms as coefficients (see: connection matrix).

This is also useful for characteristic class on vector bundles and a corresponding embedding is easily handled.

Since I am really short of time, I'm afraid this ticket have to wait.

This sounds very interesting. I hope you'll find time to work on this soon.
