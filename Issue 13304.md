# Issue 13304: deprecate jsmath_avoid_list etc.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

In #9774, we removed methods `jsmath_avoid_list` and `add_to_jsmath_avoid_list` in favor of similar methods with `mathjax` in their name. We should deprecate the jsmath versions instead of just removing them.

Thanks John! You can set a positive review on my behalf as soon as we have a confirmation that all test pass (from the patchbot or you or ...)

I don't know what's going on with the patchbot, but all tests pass for me on several platforms, and the relevant files pass tests on a few other slower platforms (where I didn't feel like running full tests).
