As discussed in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24039/showing-both-input-and-output/?answer=24040), there is no hold parameter for integration:


```
sage: integral(x^2, x, 0, 3, hold=True)
TypeError: integrate() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hold'
```


However `definite_integral` and `indefinite_integral` support this paramter:


```
sage: from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
sage: definite_integral(x^2, x, 0, 3, hold=True)
integrate(x^2, x, 0, 3)
sage: latex(_)
\int_{0}^{3} x^{2}\,{d x}
```


Since `integral` basically calls the previous functions, we should transfer this parameter.
