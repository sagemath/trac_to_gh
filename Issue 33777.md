We fix all issues raised by `./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- src/sage/graphs/pq_trees.py`. In particular, we turn the lambda functions to functions.

When turning the lambda functions to actual functions, I have not added any documentation/doctest. The reason is that I don't know what could be a suitable documentation.

I have renamed the functions adding a `_` to avoid considering them in the module's documentation.
