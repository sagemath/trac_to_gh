# Issue 28657: Move most important attributes of FaceIterator to a structure.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28894

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-12-18 09:47:57

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, face iterator, f-vector

This ticket is part of a series of tickets trying to parallelize the f-vector for polyhedra.

python classes may not be accessed in `nogil`. To access important attributes of the class `FaceIterator`, we move those attributes to a structure, which can be accessed in `nogil`.

In the dual case the n_atoms/n_coatoms where initialized wrong in the face iterator. This made doctests in #28982 fail.
