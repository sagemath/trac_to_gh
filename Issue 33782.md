I didn't know that we could check '3 in range(5)`. Good to know.

In `src/sage/combinat/designs/orthogonal_arrays_find_recursive.pyx` you could add the missing space before `#` 

```diff
-    for r in [1] + list(xrange(k+1, n-2)): # as r*1+1+1 <= n and because we need
+    for r in [1] + list(range(k+1, n-2)): # as r*1+1+1 <= n and because we need
```


In `src/sage/combinat/subword_complex.py`, isn't it better to turn `r` to a set ? I don't know if testing membership to a range is faster or not.

```diff
-        if not all(i in list(range(len(Q))) for i in F):
+        r = range(len(Q))
+        if not all(i in r for i in F):
```

voila,j'ai rajouté un ou deux espaces, malgré ma barre d'espacedéfaillante

pour le secondpoint, j'ai laissé tel quel.Jesais pas si ca serait mieux avec set ou carrement avec `0<=i<=k`

merci. Pour info:

```
sage: r = range(40)
sage: s = set(r)
sage: %timeit 34 in r
2.52 µs ± 34.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit 34 in s
197 ns ± 31.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit 0<=34<40
244 ns ± 2.08 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```

It's surprising that set is the fastest here. Interesting.
