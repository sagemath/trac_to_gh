I've actually had this problem for a long time, but never got around to reporting it--importing several modules in sage results in an `ImportError`.  For example:


```
>>> import sage.rings.integer_ring
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sage/rings/integer.pxd", line 7, in init sage.rings.integer_ring (/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer_ring.c:14483)
  File "sage/rings/rational.pxd", line 8, in init sage.rings.integer (/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:48888)
  File "sage/rings/fast_arith.pxd", line 3, in init sage.rings.rational (/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/rational.c:36668)
  File "sage/libs/pari/gen.pxd", line 6, in init sage.rings.fast_arith (/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/fast_arith.c:8273)
  File "sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx", line 90, in init sage.libs.pari.gen (/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/libs/pari/gen.c:134407)
  File "/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/infinity.py", line 227, in <module>
    from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
ImportError: cannot import name ZZ
```


This demonstrates the cycle directly: `sage.rings.integer_ring -> sage.rings.rational -> sage.rings.fast_arith -> sage.libs.pari.gen -> sage.rings.infinity -> sage.rings.integer_ring`

but the same crash can be invoked indirectly by almost anything that imports `sage.rings.integer_ring`.

Making sure to import `sage.all` first works around it, since I guess it makes sure to import modules in a very specific order so that this doesn't occur.  But that shouldn't be necessary--it should be possible to directly import modules without failure.  Either the import cycle should be broken, or it should be handled automatically at import time (such as in `sage.rings.__init__`) rather than having to import the `all` module manually.

This is a much more general problem: imports in Sage are a huge can of worms: they have to be done in a very specific order or they break.

We often try to work around this problem by importing inside methods/functions:

```
def foo():
    import something
    something()
```

instead of

```
import something

def foo():
    something()
```

or various tricks with lazy/late imports.

And Cython makes it even harder than it would otherwise be, since Cython's imports are always done first, before anything else.

I am sure that there are others, possibly many.

If you remember to import `sage.all` first, it's not such a big deal. In fact, external packages should import directly from `sage.all` if possible (`from sage.all import ZZ`).

I guess more precisely what I'm saying is that `sage.all` (and the related submodules) are serving a double purpose.  On one hand they're importing nearly *everything* and setting up the global namespace that one expects to find in the sage repl.  On the other hand they're also doing some critical setup required for modules to even work properly (such as carefully ordered imports and some other things).

The latter stuff should happen in `__init__` modules, which should only import what they need to do that setup and nothing else.

I'd like to push the priority on this one. #22747 totally breaks down when import cycles are involved because Cython does things in a different order with #22747.

Do you know of a structural solution to breaking import cycles? I'm afraid it will be a lot of work by hand to move things around.

Definitely a lot of work by hand to move things around.  Would you like me to take a stab at it?

One thing that is ugly, but that you can often get pretty far with, is moving some imports to the bottom of the module.  I'm not sure how that will play with Cython though.

For Cython that doesn't matter. Cython mostly ignores the order of the source files, it does things in its own order.

My plan is to use lazy imports a lot more. I created #22751 to improve support for lazy imports in Cython code.
