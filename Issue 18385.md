For both `coerce.pyx` and `element.pyx` in the lines

```
-cdef add, sub, mul, div, iadd, isub, imul, idiv
-from operator import add, sub, mul, div, iadd, isub, imul, idiv
+cdef add, sub, mul, div, truediv, iadd, isub, imul, idiv
+from operator import add, sub, mul, div, truediv, iadd, isub, imul, idiv
```

you inserted `truediv` but not `itruediv`.
Was this done for a reason?

Well, inplace optimizations are disabled anyway (see #1069), so it doesn't really matter.

Obvious question: did you run `make`?

Well ... I always do `./sage -b;./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-tp4-all-long-18622-2.log` ... but this time `./sage -b;` was missing ... I don't know how ...
Mea culpa - grrr
