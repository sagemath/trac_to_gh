# Issue 11470: Rewrite/improve/fix SQLDatabase and SQLQuery objects

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11642

Original creator: ohanar

Original creation time: 2011-08-02 00:07:35

Assignee: was

CC:  cremona was

Keywords: sqlite

Currently the `SQLDatabase` object in sage has a number of bugs (adding columns to a database when initializing it, keyword parsing for the `SQLQuery.show` method to name a few). There is also some missing functionality (uniqueness of non-index columns, columns of unspecified types). Also, a lot of code can be refactored/removed.

I've attached 2 patches that depend upon #11640. The is a rewrite of these objects, and moves them to `sage.databases.sql_db` and the second makes the necessary changes to `sage.graphs.graph_database`.
