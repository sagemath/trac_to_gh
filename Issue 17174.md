# Issue 17174: Added colored and signed permutations

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Keywords: permutations, complex reflection groups

Currently we do not have classes for colored nor signed permutations. Implemented as a group by using the wreath product construction.

Hi Travis,

I think it is needed to have `._gap_()` implemented on all these wreath product constructions. I am trying to do that right now.

Hey Vincent,

I agree that we probably should have a `_gap_` method. Were you able to add that code?

See also #16010 for specialized code on signed permutations.

Fixed (failure was due to Coxeter groups better understanding their category).

Let me know if what you're doing/done counts as a review and if so, when you're done (thus far, I'm good with your changes).

OOps, sorry. I just realized that I had pushed without giving my name or commenting.
Yes, I am more or less doing a review. In my spare time, so this may take longer..

No worries. Thank you for all the recent reviews you have been doing.

Comments so far:

* Make 'number_reflecting_hyperplanes' 'number_of_reflecting_hyperplanes', because that's the way permutation statistics names methods.
* Documentation should mention somewhere that \ell is the number of degrees is the rank. Some docstrings just refer to \ell, and maybe you could look back and see that \ell is the number of degrees, but then nothing mentions that the number of the degrees is the same as the rank.
* Why just left descent and not right descent?
* Colored permutations should have an inverse operation.
* There should be element constructors `ColoredPermutation` and `SignedPermutation`.
* For `m=2`, there should be a way to get between thinking of something as a `SignedPermutation` and a `ColoredPermutation`.
* Codegree documentation needs a `.. Math::` around the formula.
* Preliminary docstring/index of functions would be nice, but possibly a task for another ticket.
