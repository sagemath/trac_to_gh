Great.

Jeroen, why did you rename `OpenBLAS` to `openblas` while the former allows to download directly from upstream without having to rename ?

As far as I know, the only "releases" that OpenBLAS provides are packed github tarballs which are named like `v0.3.5.tar.gz`. So renaming is needed in any case.
