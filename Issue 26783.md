Apparently, you forgot the branch ! Note that clicking on the github link leads to a file named `OpenBLAS-0.3.5.tar.gz`, which is consistent with the `checksums.ini` file.

Great.

Jeroen, why did you rename `OpenBLAS` to `openblas` while the former allows to download directly from upstream without having to rename ?

As far as I know, the only "releases" that OpenBLAS provides are packed github tarballs which are named like `v0.3.5.tar.gz`. So renaming is needed in any case.

The link points to a file named `v0.3.5.tar.gz`, but at least for me (and apparently others) the browser automatically detects the filename as `OpenBLAS...` and saves it under that name. Not sure what is going on there.

I still prefer download locations that do not require special browser tricks.

Anyway, I'll remember for the next time to use `OpenBLAS` but for this ticket, it doesn't really matter.

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.
