This is a push to be able to use and doctest sage without SAGE_ROOT being defined. This is mainly useful for distro or if you import sage from python directly without running sage-env first.

* `sage/misc/persist.pyx` is dealt with in #27192
* in `sage/misc/citation.pyx` `SAGE_ROOT` is replaced with `""` but for all cases I have seen `SAGE_LIB` would be correct. I have only gone for `SAGE_LOCAL` in case something in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` needs to be picked up.
* in `bin/sage-notebook` and `sage/misc/package.py`, `SAGE_ROOT` is imported but not used. So I removed it while I was at it.

This ticket doesn't deal with `SAGE_ROOT` used in `src/sage/misc/copying.py`.

1. For `DOT_GIT`, I would prefer to see that added to `sage/env.py` (maybe rename it to `SAGE_ROOT_GIT`). Note that you'll need to rebase the branch to #27040 then or wait for the next beta. I'm also not convinced that we can rely on the fact that `os.path.isdir("")` returns `False`, I would prefer an explicit check for `None` there.

2. In `src/sage/misc/misc.py`, you can use `sys.executable` instead.

This is an odd way to test for `None`:

```
        try:
            have_git = os.path.exists(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        except TypeError:
            have_git
```
What's wrong with

```
        if SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None:
            have_git = os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        else:
            have_git = False
```
or even

```
        have_git = (SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None) and os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)

Well it seemed to me the pythonic way is `try:... except:` but I won't be religious on that and arguably it is not testing for `None` so yes, I could go back to the way I originally did it.

As for `python_executable` I'll admit I thought of removing it and ended up going with minimal changes.

Must be. `env.py`'s default doesn't have one and my own sage-on-gentoo `sage-env` defines `DOT_SAGE` without a trailing slash.

I think both issues are totally irrelevant now because of other changes. Although I will study #12221 because I have a issue with pari's testsuite in Gentoo's portage that may be totally related.

In this particular case I guess we need to make sure to "normalize" the path tested so it doesn't end up with a slash. Is there a python function for that?

All right, a very good question.

* `env.py` has default values for most variables but those default will be overridden if the variable is already defined in the running environment - by `sage-env` for example.
* `sage-env` is loaded by the `sage` start up script. Depending on the arguments it may actually start other scripts rather than sage itself. Those scripts may need environment variables to be set (look at `sage-cython`, `sage-ipynb2rst` ...).
