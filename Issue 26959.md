# Issue 26959: make sagelib work and doctest even if SAGE_ROOT is None

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27196

Original creator: fbissey

Original creation time: 2019-02-01 01:45:26

This is a push to be able to use and doctest sage without SAGE_ROOT being defined. This is mainly useful for distro or if you import sage from python directly without running sage-env first.

* `sage/misc/persist.pyx` is dealt with in #27192
* in `sage/misc/citation.pyx` `SAGE_ROOT` is replaced with `""` but for all cases I have seen `SAGE_LIB` would be correct. I have only gone for `SAGE_LOCAL` in case something in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` needs to be picked up.
* in `bin/sage-notebook` and `sage/misc/package.py`, `SAGE_ROOT` is imported but not used. So I removed it while I was at it.

I don't think that this actually depends on #27192.

1. For `DOT_GIT`, I would prefer to see that added to `sage/env.py` (maybe rename it to `SAGE_ROOT_GIT`). Note that you'll need to rebase the branch to #27040 then or wait for the next beta. I'm also not convinced that we can rely on the fact that `os.path.isdir("")` returns `False`, I would prefer an explicit check for `None` there.

2. In `src/sage/misc/misc.py`, you can use `sys.executable` instead.

I came to think I wasn't very pythonic as well. I should have used `try:...expect:` blocks instead of conditionals. Before #27040 there was a `SAGE_ROOT_GIT` I guess that would mean restoring it. Should we do that when it is only used in a single file as far as I can tell?

Sure. I just removed it because I wasn't used. :-)

Sure, why not? It's cleaner that way.

OK, that's a plan. Do you have any comments about `citation.pyx`?

This is an odd way to test for `None`:

```
        try:
            have_git = os.path.exists(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        except TypeError:
            have_git
```

What's wrong with

```
        if SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None:
            have_git = os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        else:
            have_git = False
```

or even

```
        have_git = (SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None) and os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-02-04 06:18:50

Also little reason to use an extra variable here:

```
        sage: python_executable = sys.executable
        sage: sage_makedirs(python_executable)
```

Why not

```
        sage: sage_makedirs(sys.executable)
```

Well it seemed to me the pythonic way is `try:... except:` but I won't be religious on that and arguably it is not testing for `None` so yes, I could go back to the way I originally did it.

As for `python_executable` I'll admit I thought of removing it and ended up going with minimal changes.

I think that mainly applies when the condition is either expensive to check or when the condition might change independently (e.g. checking for existence of a file).

Cool, that means I won't have to do it tomorrow :) your comment is more comprehensive. I guess `isdir` is a more precise test as well. Someone could have fun creating a file `SAGE_ROOT/.git` and see what breaks.

Good point, this has never actually worked.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-02-10 01:28:56

I get a doctest failure in `src/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py`:

```
Failed example:
    os.getcwd() == DOT_SAGE
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

The issue is that there is a trailing slash in `DOT_SAGE` but not in `os.getcwd()`. Does this come from `src/bin/sage-env`?

```
    # In theory, DOT_SAGE is not required to have a trailing slash.
    # But since there are some issues (#11924, maybe #12221),
    # we add a slash for safety.
    DOT_SAGE="${DOT_SAGE}/"
    export DOT_SAGE
```

Must be. `env.py`'s default doesn't have one and my own sage-on-gentoo `sage-env` defines `DOT_SAGE` without a trailing slash.

> {{{

I think both issues are totally irrelevant now because of other changes. Although I will study #12221 because I have a issue with pari's testsuite in Gentoo's portage that may be totally related.

In this particular case I guess we need to make sure to "normalize" the path tested so it doesn't end up with a slash. Is there a python function for that?

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-02-10 02:49:44

Would using `os.getcwd() ==  os.path.normpath(DOT_SAGE)` (provided the right imports before hand) instead work?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-02-10 05:00:35

OK `normpath` works. `samefile` would be nice but is not available on windows apparently, so that could cause trouble on cygwin. 

Extra question: what should we do about that difference between `sage-env` and `env.py`? Should we have trailing `/` at all?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-02-10 05:06:57

I don't understand the comment in `sage-env` about #11924, since that ticket was explicitly trying to set things up so a trailing backslash would not be necessary. For this ticket I would just use `os.path.normpath`, but we should also (probably on a different ticket) try removing the trailing slash. I don't know the relationship between `src/sage/env.py` and `src/bin/sage-env`: do we need to deal with `DOT_SAGE` in `sage-env` if we set it in `env.py`?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-02-10 06:40:44

All right, a very good question. 

* `sage-env` contains many things and does overlaps with `env.py`
* `env.py` has default values for most variables but those default will be overridden if the variable is already defined in the running environment - by `sage-env` for example.
* `sage-env` is loaded by the `sage` start up script. Depending on the arguments it may actually start other scripts rather than sage itself. Those scripts may need environment variables to be set (look at `sage-cython`, `sage-ipynb2rst` ...).
* `env.py` has default that means sage will start if you load it directly from python. With this ticket and a few others, it will just work even if no environment variables are loaded from `sage-env` before hand. Except for `sage/misc/copying.py` (which isn't doctested).

Now, a lot of the stuff in `sage-env` is about the building of sage. Some other stuff is about the self containment of sage. For example, sage change the default ipython folder to `.sage/ipython` so there is no interference with a system package. This is of course moot for sage-on-distro. Finally there is stuff that is really for running sage and that is mostly redundant with `env.py`.

Finally I should plug myself [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-packaging/X-cMW8fFfso](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-packaging/X-cMW8fFfso). Note that I still have `DOT_SAGE` in `sage-env` because of some scripts called from the sage starting shell script (`sage-cleaner` and `sage-runtests` being the most concerning).
