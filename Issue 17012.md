# Issue 17012: Redundant question after assumption in integration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17249

CC:  jakobkroeker

From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/L75JgocZc3I verbatim:

```
a,b=var('a b');
assume(4*b^2-4*a^2<0);
assume((b-a)*(b+a)<0);
integrate(1/(a-b*sin(x)),x,-oo,oo)
```

> It complains and asks whether (b-a)*(b+a) is negative or positive.

Seems fixed meanwhile (sage 7.6 beta4). Add a test?
