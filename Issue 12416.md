Assignee: @burcin

Keywords: absolute value, symbolic

We have

```
sage: abs(pi*I)
I*pi
```
which is wrong. The result should be `pi`.

(see [this long discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/6j-LcC6tpkE) as to connections to derivatives).  As long as that's intentional, fine.

In the original [discussion leading to this ticket](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/KLvQSnja21c), we have this example, which is still around.

```

Again, just wondering if that is intentional, should be another ticket, belongs here... etc.  It seems to relate to whether something is a "constant" or just in SR.

```
sage: abs(euler_gamma*I)
euler_gamma
sage: abs(5*I)
5
sage: abs(e^5*I)
abs(I*e^5)
```
I guess this would, in principle, belong to this ticket as well, though I understand not wanting to hold up on #18537 since these are sort of intertwined.  I don't have any other objections to this, though.

That's because the product's factors are separated into real constants and the rest. If the rest is constant, take `abs` of it, else `abs().hold()`. Then multiply together. Here `I*x` has symbols so it is held.

> {{{
> sage: abs(log(2)*I) 
> abs(I*log(2))
> }}}

This is because `log(2)` is a function expression.
> {{{
> abs(I*e^5)
> }}}

Here `exp(5)` is just printed as `e^5` but is a function expression as well.

I haven't thought about how to efficiently determine if an expression with held function values is constant, but I have opened https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/56. However I'd suggest not to hold up this ticket for this.

Anyhow, since `abs(I)` already in current Sage gives `1`, the expression `abs(I*x)` should be simplified to `abs(x)`.
