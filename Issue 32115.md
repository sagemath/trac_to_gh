I made some changes to improve the speed by creating fewer transient objects and using more efficient code paths. I also tweaked the doctests so that everything is tested on systems without coxeter3 and all tests pass both with and without coxeter3. I also tweaked the documentation accordingly and hid the internal computational methods. If my changes are good, then positive review.
