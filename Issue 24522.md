# Issue 24522: Sort the repr of PolyDict by its dict keys

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24759

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-02-16 16:49:39

This is one of those cases where a class has a `dict` representation embedded in its repr, so where IPython would normally pprint the plain `dict` it does not pprint the embedded `dict`.

The `PolyDict` class is only used internally so this should be a low impact change, but that enhances its testability (especially in moving to Python 3).

Interesting. I never heard about `pprint`.

positive review if tests pass.

Huh, thanks for fixing those additional tests.  Those must be new since I first made this change (which was actually quite a few weeks ago now).
