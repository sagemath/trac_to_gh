It is silly that the default for equation systems over GF(2) as produced by `mq.SR` is !Singular and not PolyBoRi.

The attached patch fixes that and also changes the default term ordering to "deglex" which is a PolyBoRi native ordering ("degrevlex" is not).

This patch depends on #13847 which removes some deprecated code.

I wouldn't do so, because it's a completely unrelated problem (as far as I understand). So for documentation reasons this should be a new ticket.

BTW: the fix itself is trivial: one just has to remove the corresponding lines of the form `n = self._n`.
