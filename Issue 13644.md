# Issue 13644: mq.SR: use deglex and polybori (if GF(2)) by default

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13848

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2012-12-19 13:58:37

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  polybori alexanderdreyer cosh

It is silly that the default for equation systems over GF(2) as produced by `mq.SR` is !Singular and not PolyBoRi.

The attached patch fixes that and also changes the default term ordering to "deglex" which is a PolyBoRi native ordering ("degrevlex" is not).

This patch depends on #13847 which removes some deprecated code.

The patch is fine. When bot green-lits, I can give a positive review.

Maybe one can also use this patch to correct the following things (found by pyflakes):

```
sage/crypto/mq/sr.py:2453: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
sage/crypto/mq/sr.py:3180: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
```

I wouldn't do so, because it's a completely unrelated problem (as far as I understand). So for documentation reasons this should be a new ticket.

BTW: the fix itself is trivial: one just has to remove the corresponding lines of the form `n = self._n`.

I agree with AlexanderDreyer, this is out of scope. Feel free to open a new ticket though.

Can we set this to positive review? It holds up #13849 and I just got another bug report that is due to #13849.

Hi Martin! Of course, my intention was to give a positive review then.
