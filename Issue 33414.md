This is how we can read out the `kernel_spec`.

```
sage: from jupyter_client.kernelspec import get_kernel_spec
sage: spec = get_kernel_spec('sagemath')
sage: spec.argv[0]
'/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-gcc11/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/bin/sage'
```

Minor edits.

With my limited tests, it works well. I am positive.
