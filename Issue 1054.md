The reference manual chapter on number fields only lists number fields and their elements as sections.  It should also list orders, class groups, etc.  I.e., because of code refactoring.

This is just a few lines added to the ref repository.

Can this be closed now as fixed? The chapter [Algebraic Number Fields](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/number_fields.html) in the reference manual contains sections on various topics on number fields.
