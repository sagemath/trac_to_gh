I'm not sure about this one: if I understand right, inplace arithmetic methods were included in the coercion model for the reasons outlined in #624. The optimization described there apparently has been disabled at some point, but are you sure that the idea couldn't be made to work?

To be more precise: in #1038 and #18772.

It seems really hard: it seems that the reference count is not accurate enough to make it work.

Okay, indeed, it doesn't make much sense to keep these methods after #18772, and the arguments in the thread you linked to sound convincing.
