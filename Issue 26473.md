# Issue 26473: interact `text_control` should use HTMLMath not HTML

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26710

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2018-11-18 01:41:57

`text_control` in the following does not typeset `$A$` in `text_control`.

```
@interact
def _(a=text_control("Put a matrix $A$"), b=input_grid(2,2, default=[[1,2],[3,4]], label='')):
    m = matrix(b)
    print(m)
```


Sage in jupyter use `HTML` widget to render `text_control`. The widget `HTML` does not typeset maths. We should switch to `HTMLMath`.

By the way,  the above example reveals abother defect. `label` with empty string does not make the label of the `input_grid` blank, unlike as expected.

"An HTML" sounds strange to me, but I'm not a native English speaker...

Replying to [comment:4 jdemeyer]:

Neither am I, but from //StackExchange//, 

    An html but a hyper text...
    Similarly, an MBA but a Masters of Business....

because "html" begins with a vowel, echh-tee-em-el. 

Thanks!

OK, I thought that "H" was pronounced starting with an "h" sound (more like haitch) but apparently not...
