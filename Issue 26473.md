`text_control` in the following does not typeset `$A$` in `text_control`.

```
@interact
def _(a=text_control("Put a matrix $A$"), b=input_grid(2,2, default=[[1,2],[3,4]], label='')):
    m = matrix(b)
    print(m)
```


Sage in jupyter use `HTML` widget to render `text_control`. The widget `HTML` does not typeset maths. We should switch to `HTMLMath`.

By the way,  the above example reveals abother defect. `label` with empty string does not make the label of the `input_grid` blank, unlike as expected.

Neither am I, but from //StackExchange//, 

    An html but a hyper text...
    Similarly, an MBA but a Masters of Business....

because "html" begins with a vowel, echh-tee-em-el. 

Thanks!
