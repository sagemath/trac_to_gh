David Zywina pointed out to me that the docstring for the Sage function clearly states: "Return True if the mod-p representation is surjective onto Aut(E[p])=GL2(Fp).  False if it is not, or None if we were unable to determine whether it is or not."   
So according to the docstring, if the functions returns either True or False, then it returns the right answer.  The documentations suggests that if the function returns None (which is completely different than True/False in Python), then you have to re-call it with a bigger parameter.  That said, I just looked through the actual source code, and this simply isn't true at all!

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('147b1')
sage: rho = E.galois_representation()
sage: rho._is_surjective??
...
    while ell < A:
        ell = arith.next_prime(ell)
        if Np % ell != 0:
            ...
    return False    #, signs
```


That "return False" at the end should be "return None" according to the docstring.  So this is a serious bug in the Sage documentation or in the function.  The options for a fix are:

1.  Probably the function as is can never ever prove non-surjectivity, except in various special cases.   It should be changed to a better one that can prove non-surjectivity maybe following [1], or at least using division polynomials (since p<=37 anyways). 

2. Change the lying docstring a lot to agree with the code.    NOTE: One should probably also change the docstring for the deprecated "E.is_surjective()" which is also misleading. 

[1] http://www.math.upenn.edu/~zywina/papers/EffectiveModl.pdf

I could imagine doing 2 above quickly, then opening another ticket for 1, or even having 1 as part of #11270 later. 

I'm marking this as "critical" since it is a major misleading mathematical bug, and it is functionality that gets used as a hypothesis for computational papers a lot (though in practice always in the direction that is safe, but who knows?).

Finally !! I corrected this. 

So I decided to change the code. It now returns True False or None, depending if the algorithm can prove that it is surjective, can prove that it is not or if it is indecisive. I think this is more useful than the previous version.

Of course, I also altered the documentation to make sure the issue with 2 and 3 is correctly stated.

As discussed above. After this ticket a natural step would be to implement Zywina's bounds and criterions in his paper. I have tried so and that is documented on the ticket #12270 and should not concern this ticket any more. The ticket #11276 should be closed as a duplicate.

Reviewer's comments (not only on the proposed changes, sorry):

1. The functions `_splitting_field()` and `_division_field()` would be used a lot if they were more visible!  Please please please open two tickets dependent on this one to move these!

2. There are quite a few little typos in the docstrings and comments (and at least one verbose message).  Worth taking this opportunity to fix.

3. It is very dangerous to store the underlying elliptic curve as G.E and the return it when asked since it can be changed!

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: G = E.galois_representation()
sage: G.E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
sage: G.is_surjective(5)
False
sage: G.E = EllipticCurve('14a1')                                                                               
sage: G
Compatible family of Galois representations associated to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 + 4*x - 6 over Rational Field
sage: G.is_surjective(5)                                                                                        
False
```

I don't know how to make a data field read-only, so I think the way to do this is to return copy(E) in the function elliptic_curve().

4. G.reducible_primes() only returns a list of the primes p for which there is a p-isogeny from E to some other curve, so ignores the CM case.  This should be corrected, or at least the documentation changed!

```
 sage: E = EllipticCurve('27a1')
sage: E.has_cm()
True
sage: G = E.galois_representation()
sage: G.reducible_primes()
[3]
```

Of course it is not clear what the output should be here.  We could follow the LMFDB route (see http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/27.a3) and only list the primes up to 37, with proper documentation of course.  Otherwise we could try to be too clever and return (in that example) [3, Mod(1,3)].

More comments to follow -- I don't trust trac not to lose all thet I have written so far...

OK. 
1) Opened a new ticket
2) I found a few misprints in the documentation.
3) I changed .E to ._E and returned copy for .elliptic_curve(). I hope that is what you had in mind.
4) no change as explained above
5) I don't think it makes a big difference. I would rather leave the well-tested current version even if it is slightly too complicated. It is still easy to read from the code what it does. If you insist, I can change that, too, but it will be in the new year.

Sorry, just a stupid mistake on my part.

I don't know of a rule, but one has to be careful.  Similarly, elliptic curves used to cache their a-invariants as a list and return them which meant that they could be changed;  to avoid that the invariants are cached as a tuple which is immutable.  But here it is the curve itself which is being cached.  I also realise that the same problem exists with, for example, the period lattice of an elliptic curve.  Sometimes people use a double underscore attribute name (e.g. `EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup` has an attribute `__E` to store its curve, but that in itself does not stop it being maliciously (or by mistake) changed.

We may need to consult experts on this.

OK, it is fairly harmless but if #11270 is stalled then perhaps it is worth changing here.  Later: no need, it is harmless.

OK, thanks -- sorry I was lazy and did not give line numbers.
