# Issue 17138: Maxima should not need a working C compiler to run

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17375

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2014-11-21 10:16:01

CC:  nbruin vbraun

Keywords: maxima

It turns out that after the upgrade to Maxima 5.34.1 (#16908), a working C compiler is needed to run Maxima on ECL, which is of course inacceptable.  The problem is caused by the compilation of four regular expressions on startup.

As a workaround until this is fixed upstream, we revert the Maxima commit introducing this compilation.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Thanks for the quick diagnosis.   I'm trying this right now.  For full testing, someone should test this on a system which does NOT have the compiler - though I don't know how such a person would get the branch!  (Maybe move gcc after compiling?)

I would almost say this earns a "bug fix only release", at least for the purpose of making binaries, though unfortunately this branch is based on beta0.  After all, it breaks a lot of calculus!   Volker, what do you think?

I'm happy with this, it solves the problem of the extra messages and hence presumably the compiler, passes tests, _and_ I have tested that moving the Sage gcc out of the way when this is not applied causes the problem with `GAZONK` when running `sage -maxima`, but doing so after this branch is applied causes no problems.

So I think we are cool here.  Anything I might have missed?  Again, I think it is quite reasonable to have a bug fix with just this commit cherry-picked as Sage 6.4.1 (after all, no new spkg needed) while _also_ including this in the normal Sage 6.5.beta1 so as not to worry about history.

Thanks for the quick review!

This also sounds good to me.

Well, having calculus work for non-developers is a fairly high priority for me ;-)

Hopefully our release manager will concur, though it will probably be a little extra annoying.

Anything that you want in a hotfix must be based on 6.4, otherwise it'll drag in the whole beta. Cherry-picking would just lead to merge conflicts later, its akin to rebasing.

Here is a (one-commit) branch with the same content but now based on 6.4.

Thanks for doing that!

Volker, you can still add this commit in the next beta as well, correct - the conflicts only would happen the other direction, I guess?

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-11-23 11:17:01

Conflicts happen if you put the same change to the source under more than one commit, I don't understand what you mean by direction. There is only one direction in git, and that is forward ;-)

Just FYI this has been [fixed upstream](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/9a450c2a330366a5ba3308176e8d51f5ee5b8ff4/tree/src/commac.lisp?diff=2527b32568302de0b619e21e658cfdf86f6b7c8e), so when we upgrade again, we can remove this patch.

An improved fix by Nils has now been committed upstream: http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2848/
