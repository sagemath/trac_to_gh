It turns out that after the upgrade to Maxima 5.34.1 (#16908), a working C compiler is needed to run Maxima on ECL, which is of course inacceptable.  The problem is caused by the compilation of four regular expressions on startup.

As a workaround until this is fixed upstream, we revert the Maxima commit introducing this compilation.

Well, having calculus work for non-developers is a fairly high priority for me ;-)

Hopefully our release manager will concur, though it will probably be a little extra annoying.

Volker, you can still add this commit in the next beta as well, correct - the conflicts only would happen the other direction, I guess?
