# Issue 13035: Please consider updating to gfan 0.5

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13207

Original creator: pcpa

Original creation time: 2012-07-05 15:41:11

Assignee: tbd

As far as I checked, the sagemath gfan spkg patches are already applied to gfan 0.5.

I made a few changes to the package in a RFE (request for enhancement) to the gfan 0.5 fedora package at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=837857. Most noticeable one should be that I added a gfan-permissive.patch to make it work if called as `gfan` instead of erroring out and telling to call it `gfan_bases`. But it could be changed to be called as 'gfan_bases' in `sage/interfaces/gfan.py`.

The major issue I noticed is that, the first previous doctest failure due to it wanting to be called `gfan_bases` now gives a different result in one of the tests:


```
