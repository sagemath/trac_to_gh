Here (and in similar cases)

```
+.. [BIANCO] L. Bianco, P. Dell‘Olmo, S. Giordani
```

you need to add a backslash before the first initial.

```
+.. [BIANCO] \L. Bianco, P. Dell‘Olmo, S. Giordani
```

for obscure sphinx technical reasons. Otherwise Sphinx thinks that this is an letter-numbered item.

I think it would be good to have the references still referenced in their original location (at least for those methods that do not have an explicit reference otherwise).

To clarify: do you mean, for example, the very last change in the current set of commits, where the reference `[EPW14]` is removed from `sage/combinat/posets/posets.py`? I agree, somewhere in that docstring, we should have "See [EPW14]_" or something similar.

But it has. "We follow the definition given in [EPW14]_. Let G denote - -".

I may have make mistakes, but my intention was not to remove any reference.

I thought I saw a few that were missing, but looking again, I cannot find them. LGTM.

Thanks. Maybe it was graphviz link. It is still there, but not as a "reference" as IMO it differs from other links given as references.
