Here (and in similar cases)

```
+.. [BIANCO] L. Bianco, P. Dell‘Olmo, S. Giordani
```
you need to add a backslash before the first initial.

To clarify: do you mean, for example, the very last change in the current set of commits, where the reference `[EPW14]` is removed from `sage/combinat/posets/posets.py`? I agree, somewhere in that docstring, we should have "See [EPW14]_" or something similar.

But it has. "We follow the definition given in [EPW14]_. Let G denote - -".

I may have make mistakes, but my intention was not to remove any reference.
