Here (and in similar cases)

```
+.. [BIANCO] L. Bianco, P. Dell‘Olmo, S. Giordani
```

you need to add a backslash before the first initial.

```

```

for obscure sphinx technical reasons. Otherwise Sphinx thinks that this is an letter-numbered item.

To clarify: do you mean, for example, the very last change in the current set of commits, where the reference `[EPW14]` is removed from `sage/combinat/posets/posets.py`? I agree, somewhere in that docstring, we should have "See [EPW14]_" or something similar.
