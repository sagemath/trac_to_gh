# Issue 23565: Ncurses crash with x.abc? on OpenSuSE

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23802

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-09-08 06:06:39

Any attempt to get online help (for example `x.n?`) crashes Sage. I'm assuming this is system-specific because noone has reported it yet. Gdb backtrace:

```

It might be relevant to mention which kind of terminal you use.

And does the problem occur with all terminals (say, `xterm` or pure console session at `/dev/tty1`)?

This completely disappeared, somewhat after I deleted my `$HOME/.sage` directory (which I did because I could no longer start Sage). So I guess the cause was corruption of one of the files in that directory.
