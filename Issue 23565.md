And does the problem occur with all terminals (say, `xterm` or pure console session at `/dev/tty1`)?

This completely disappeared, somewhat after I deleted my `$HOME/.sage` directory (which I did because I could no longer start Sage). So I guess the cause was corruption of one of the files in that directory.
