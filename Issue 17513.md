# Issue 17513: Random failure in sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker.__dealloc__

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17750

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2015-02-09 00:15:34

CC:  ncohen

Keywords: random_fail

This sometimes fails (to be expected, not a safe way to test for memory leaks):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/genus.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/genus.pyx", line 136, in sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker.__dealloc__
Failed example:
    get_memory_usage(t) <= 0.0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  10 in sage.graphs.genus.simple_connected_genus_backtracker.__dealloc__
    [61 tests, 1 failure, 21.14 s]
```

just a comment: don't expect a 10 minutes fix for this one, I have no idea how that code works.

...

Oh. Just a stupid doctest. I see.

What do you think should be done with this doctest ? Simply removed ? I don't see how I could make it work.

still happens.

Should be removed if it can't be made to work reliably.
