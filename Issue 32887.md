How about editing spaces in the examples while we are at it?

> How about editing spaces in the examples while we are at it?
Can you give me a hint on what I have to look for? I don't think I get what are you refering to.
Do you mean?

```
        sage: from sage.plot.point import Point
-       sage: P = Point([1,2],[2,3],{'alpha':.5})
+       sage: P = Point([1 ,2],[2, 3], {'alpha':.5})
```

I guess I meant 

```diff

There are more of such lines.

Usually you are free to set back to positive review after resolving simple merge conflicts. But in this case, let us wait for documentation build.
