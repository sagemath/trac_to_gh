As far as I can see almost all the changes are cosmetic / white space in code or docstrings, which I am quite happy with.  (I think I wrote a lot of the affected code in 2007 as my very first contribution to Sage.) As long as the docs build with no errors and look OK, I am happy with all that,.  As for the new-style comparison code, if the tests still pass then I am happy with that too.

Thank you, John. 

Patchbot is green, so all doctests pass and doc builds. I am therefore setting to positive review.
