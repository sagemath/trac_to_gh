A trivial case, but it should work anyway:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[]])
sage: P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.integral_points()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good. I pondered a bit over the "single point in zero dimension", but well. Sounds like a valid convention.

Thanks,

The zero dimensional vector space consists of one element: the zero element. There are two polytopes in this space: the empty polytope and the polytope with one vertex, namely the zero element.

Resolution: fixed
