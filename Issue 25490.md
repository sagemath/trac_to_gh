# Issue 25490: Prevent giac from giving localized output

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: arojas

Original creation time: 2018-07-01 10:59:38

CC:  jdemeyer chapoton tmonteil slelievre vdelecroix

Running the tests in a system with Spanish locale gives some failures, such as

```
File "src/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1506, in sage.calculus.calculus.laplace
Failed example:
    laplace(t^n, t, s, algorithm='giac')
Expected:
    laplace(t^n, t, s)
Got:
    integrar(t^n*e^(-s*t), t, 0, +Infinity)
```


This is caused by giac returning localized output depending on the system locale.

The fix makes sense, but wouldn't it be better to add to _all_ interfaces? Say in `src/sage/interfaces/expect.py` around line 480.

Anything else needed here? There are still a few spurious doctest failures on systems with Spanish locale in 8.4, would be good to get this in.

This became a much bigger problem now that #27958 is in and some integrals are computed using giac. For instance, this doesn't work in 8.9.beta4 with LANG=es_ES:


```
sage: integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x)
integrar(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
```


as opposed to the expected


```
1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
```

This seems to be the right fix in the case of giac, because giac apparently reads the `LANG` environment variable directly to choose the names used in its output instead of calling `setlocale()`. However, with other interfaces, setting `LANG=C` may not be enough (I expect), because the user may have set `LC_MESSAGES`, which takes priority over `LANG`. So I think you probably should set `LC_ALL` (or maybe just `LC_MESSAGES` and `LC_NUMERIC`?) in addition to `LANG`.

Are you aware of any other interface affected by this? This branch is meant to fix a very concrete issue with giac, perhaps it can be extended in the future if some other interfaces are found to misbehave with non-English LC_MESSAGES. I'd rather not risk running into potential unexpected side effects of modifying additional env variables.

Changing priority from major to blocker.

setting as blocker as per comment:6

No.

But then your original version that only applied to the giac interface makes more sense to me.

Yes, you have a point there. jdemeyer: should I revert back to the original commit or extend it to LC_ALL?

Since Jeroen seems to be busy with other things, I took the liberty of reverting the branch to the version dealing only with giac and giving the ticket positive review. Please feel free to undo that if you disagree!
