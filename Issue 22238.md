# Issue 22238: weird behaviour of ; in sage console

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: aurel

Original creation time: 2017-02-28 23:21:20

CC:  chapoton jipilab

Keywords: days84

In the following code

```
sage: 1
1
sage: 1;
sage: 1; 2
1
2
sage: 1; 2;
```

I would expect the third input to only print the 2.

Changing keywords from "days84" to "days84, days100".

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
