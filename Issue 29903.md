# Issue 29903: remove deprecated method set_planar_positions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30140

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-07-14 12:57:14

This method is deprecated since 3 years (#24494) and its documentation says "This method is deprecated since Sage-4.4.1.alpha2.". So it's time to remove it.

ok, allons-y.

Note : On m'a parfois imposé d'attendre 12 mois après la première version stable qui suit l'inclusion de la déprécation.
