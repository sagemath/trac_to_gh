Replying to [comment:4 chapoton]:
> ok, but next time try to avoid creating very long lines

Actually, I used the pycodestyle linter of vscode and I believe that the max line length was set to 160 (this is the max lentgh before a warning appears), but I have no objection of fixing the long lines for this ticket (max 79).
