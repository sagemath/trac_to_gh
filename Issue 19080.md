Do you really need the whole Golay code for this? This graph has vertex-transitive automorphism group, Mathieu(24), acting on certain 12-subsets. Or you can use `AtlasGroup`:


```
sage: g=libgap.AtlasGroup("M24",libgap.NrMovedPoints,1288)
sage: G=Graph()
sage: G.add_edges(libgap.Orbit(g,[1,2],libgap.OnSets))
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(1288, 495, 206, 180)
```

You can add a commit if you prefer. I admit that I prefer it the way it is written, as you can explain the construction a bit better than just "some orbit will work". I don't mind either way.

"some orbit will work", as it is a rank 3 permutation representation of `M_{24}`.
You can refer to Conway et al. Atlas of Finite Group. It was certainly well-known long before the reference you provide.

It's also mind-boggling the way it is given, that it works. In fact, it's a property of the extended Golay code (i.e. `sage.coding.code_constructions.ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()`), that it only has words of length 0,8,12,16, and 24), so you can relate the graph vertices to certain 1288 partitions of the 24-set into 12+12, with `M_{24}` acting in the natural way (`onSetsSets` ?).

You work with the shorter (length 23) code, on which `M_{24}` acts as a linear group, so this is less transparent.

Sorry Dima, I already wrote this code once and it works, now if you prefer a different set of 4 lines of code and a different documentation please add a commit, I will not mind.

Anyway, if you take the symmetric differences of size 8, not 12, you will get the complementary graph - less edges, quicker to build, no?

and how about this doctest?

```
    A realizable set of parameters that Sage cannot realize (help us!)::

        sage: graphs.strongly_regular_graph(1288, 495, 206, existence=True)
        True
        sage: graphs.strongly_regular_graph(1288, 495, 206)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        RuntimeError: Andries Brouwer's database claims that such a (1288,495,206,180)-strongly
        regular graph exists, but Sage does not know how to build it.
        ...
```


shouldn't you change it? (feel free to take the example on 378 vertices from Muzychuk's paper, this is not something we will have very soon...)

Well, as we hope to fill all those cases in a couple of months,  thought that we would be better without it `:-/`

Why? We need all of them!

how about my comment 7?

It saves around .3s over a 1.7 seconds computation. If that interests you, you are welcome to change all the figures in this function, change its name and the doc to get it.

oh well, this is not too far from "forgetting to zip up" stage :-)
