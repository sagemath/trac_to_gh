# Issue 1004: basic discrete dynamical systems functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/1004

Original creator: mhampton

Original creation time: 2007-10-26 16:46:57

Assignee: mhampton

Keywords: dynamical, cobweb, orbit

Native sage dynamical systems functions for cobweb plots and orbit diagrams.  Needs a lot of work, but more fun than incorporating PyDSTool, PyCont, or AUTO. Eventually someone needs to get AUTO included.
