Speaking of which: I would vote for including the tikz-graph and tikz-berge style file in the Sage distribution, in particular so that latex runs from Sage would find them. Each time I tried to install them myself, it was a pain (including finding them) ...

They are very small, and this would improve quite some the user experience.

What do you think?

The current TeX-live distribution contains tkz-graph and tkz-berge. Do (current versions of) other TeX distributions already contain it? They didn't a few years ago, but maybe now we don't have to distribute it, and maybe now we should also just point the user to some popular TeX distributions. The links in the documentation could certainly be changed to the CTAN pages http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-berge and http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph.
