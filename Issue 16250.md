# Issue 16250: Fix ascii art of tableaux

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2014-06-16 19:22:56

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat boussica

Keywords: tableaux, convention, ascii art

Currently it only prints in French convention for non `repr` formats:

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]])
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="compact")
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="table")
sage: ascii_art(t)
+---+---+
+---+---+---+
+---+---+---+
```

It seems that you ignore number greater than 9 ;-)

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,15,7],[12,5,6],[8,10],[9]])
sage: ascii_art(t)
+---+
+---+---+
+---+---+---+
+---+---+---+---+
+---+---+---+---+
```

| 9 |
| 8 | 10 |
| 12 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 | 2 | 15 | 7 |
I cced Adrien Boussicault which also wrote code for that.

In the message above, the code was tested on sage3.beta3 while I got the following with your branch

```
sage: sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,15,7],[12,5,6],[8,10],[9]])
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="table")
sage: sage: ascii_art(t)
+---+---+---+---+
+---+---+---+---+
+---+---+---+
+---+---+
+---+
```

A bit disturbing.

Now that should be a lot better (plus faster to test, `tableau.py` was taking some 70s to test each time...with 4 cores).

Okay, I've fixed all the little issues/errors I came across.

Hi Travis,

In my proposed commit I simplified the loops and used the nice string `.format()` method.

I do not think we should go further as Adrien's code can print a tableau of tableaux with centered cell... and even more complicated stuff!! I hope he will submit his code soon (hint).

If you are happy with my review commit, set to positive review.

Vincent

I like the use of `format()`, but I changed it to the centering format specifier `^`. So now we get:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1,2,3,10,15],[12,15,17123231]])
sage: print T._ascii_art_table()
+----+----+----------+----+----+
+----+----+----------+----+----+
+----+----+----------+
sage: print T._ascii_art_compact()
```

If this is good for you, then positive review.
