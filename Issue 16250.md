CC:  sage-combinat boussica

Keywords: tableaux, convention, ascii art, sd58

Currently it only prints in French convention for non `repr` formats:

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]])
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="compact")
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="table")
sage: ascii_art(t)
+---+---+

Hi Travis,

In my proposed commit I simplified the loops and used the nice string `.format()` method.

I do not think we should go further as Adrien's code can print a tableau of tableaux with centered cell... and even more complicated stuff!! I hope he will submit his code soon (hint).

If you are happy with my review commit, set to positive review.

Vincent
