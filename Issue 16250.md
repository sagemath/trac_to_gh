Keywords: tableaux, convention, ascii art

Currently it only prints in French convention for non `repr` formats:

```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]])
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="compact")
sage: Tableaux.global_options(ascii_art="table")
sage: ascii_art(t)

Hi Travis,

In my proposed commit I simplified the loops and used the nice string `.format()` method.

I do not think we should go further as Adrien's code can print a tableau of tableaux with centered cell... and even more complicated stuff!! I hope he will submit his code soon (hint).

If you are happy with my review commit, set to positive review.

Vincent

I like the use of `format()`, but I changed it to the centering format specifier `^`. So now we get:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1,2,3,10,15],[12,15,17123231]])
sage: print T._ascii_art_table()
+----+----+----------+----+----+
+----+----+----------+----+----+
