I am happy with this change, but a lot more documentation is needed. Likely you will want to move most of the doc from the `FreeModuleFactory`.

The `construction()` will need a doctest.

I have taken out the commit that adds it; I will continue with that on #30235.

Doctest failures in `src/sage/structure/factory.pyx` according to the patchbot.

patchbot plugin complains about this:

```
+       EXAMPLE::
+       EXAMPLE::
+       EXAMPLE::
```

These are headers for a single example each. Should this be changed, or do we just ignore this plugin message?

I think the convention is to always use `EXAMPLES` (plural) even for a single example, hence the patchbot complaint.

Thank you. One minor nitpick:

```diff
-        TODO: replace the above by ``TestSuite(...).run()``, once
-        :meth:`_test_pickling` will test unique representation and not
-        only equality.
+        .. TODO::
+
+            Replace the above by ``TestSuite(...).run()``, once
+            :meth:`_test_pickling` will test unique representation
+            and not only equality.
```

Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
