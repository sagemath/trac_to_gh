underscore should be used as a variable loop only iff its value is not used

otherwise, one should use a normal variable

green bot, but not sure if this is a good idea. Maybe only the first commit ?

Code golf! These list-of-empty-list loops can all be sped up a little if you avoid creating the (unused) int objects:


```
sage: %timeit [[] for _ in range(1000)]
206 µs ± 11.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
sage: %timeit [[] for _ in repeat(None,1000)]
163 µs ± 13.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```


The numbers vary, but the `itertools.repeat` version is always better.

Thanks `@`mjo for that tip! Modulo that, I like both commits.

typos fixed, green lights again. Good to go ?

I think you missed a few range->repeat conversions in `tableau_tuple.py`? It's not a big deal to me but it looks like you tried to change all of the others.

For another small optimization, I see you touched a few lines of the form `prod([iterator])`. Those can be sped up by removing the intermediate list, since `prod()` is happy to use the iterator. For example:


```
sage: %timeit prod(ZZ(i) for i in range(1,10000))
16 ms ± 108 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit prod([ZZ(i) for i in range(1,10000)])
18.7 ms ± 76.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```


You can set it to positive review on my behalf when either you make those changes or you choose not to. They're minor.

Replying to [comment:2 chapoton]:

I'm not a huge fan of using the underscore for unused variables (it makes the line harder to read in your head), but it's a well-known python convention, and PEP 640 to provide an explicit alternative was rejected. I think it's fine to do now and then later (if anyone cares) decide whether or not we want to adopt or outlaw the convention within sage.

thanks, let's keep further changes for other tickets.
