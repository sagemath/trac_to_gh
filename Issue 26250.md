Depending on how ambitious one is, this is either a documentation bug or a missing feature. It seems that `isogenies_prime_degree` only finds separable isogenies, so it never finds the Frobenius. It does find the Verschiebung for ordinary elliptic curves (where it's found multiple times somehow) but not for supersingular elliptic curves.

Ordinary:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(5), [1,1])
sage: E.trace_of_frobenius()
-3
sage: L = E.isogenies_prime_degree(5); L
[Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 5,
 Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 5,
 Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 5,
 Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 5,
 Isogeny of degree 5 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 5 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 5]
sage: L[0] == L[1]
True
```


Supersingular:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(5), [0,1])
sage: E.trace_of_frobenius()
0
sage: E.isogenies_prime_degree(5)
[]
```
