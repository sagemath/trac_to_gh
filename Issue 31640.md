I personally don't like adding `RealSet` to `TopologicalSpaces`. Imo the difference between `RealSet` and `OpenInterval` should be exactly that: seeing them as sets or manifolds (i.e. top. spaces).

Then a forgetful functor would also make more sense.

Just because it comes with a natural topology doesn't mean it is the topology the user wants.

If you argument like that, every set must be seen in the category of topological spaces, because every set is endowed with a topology.

`RealSet` provides constructors for certain subsets of the reals. The "set" of real numbers comes with a distinguished topology, which is reflected by the names of the `RealSet` constructors for intervals such as `open`, `closed`. 

In #31881 (`RealSet`: Extend constructors so that they can build manifold objects) I plan to add a `category` keyword argument. Then also the rather specialized use case that a subset of the real numbers is to be treated merely as a set can be achieved by passing `category=Sets()` to the constructors.

Just because it acts as the identity on parents, doesn't mean it is the identity functor. Be very careful with confusing abstract and concrete mathematics. If I said `ZZ` the set is the same as `ZZ` the ring, would you agree or disagree? Or would you be like Bill Clinton and state "That depends on what the definition of 'is' is."? The forgetful functor does carry some information, and that is the category you obtain at the end. It could also be used as a base class when you do have some more canonical implementations, but currently it doesn't seem to be used.

By being in the category of topological spaces, you are stating there is a preferred topology. This is akin to the `WithBasis` category saying there is a distinguished basis. This is why `TopologicalSpaces` is constructed as a functor construction category.

For the manifold code, while it is dynamic, each manifold is not meant to be treated as something that can change. So if you go from differentiable to topological, you either are actually constructing a different object because the maximal atlas is different or it has the same maximal atlas and you still require the maps to be differentiable. We just may not have provided enough information yet to see that difference.
