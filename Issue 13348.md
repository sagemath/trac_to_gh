Hi, This ticket is about entering a comment in finite_class.py to no longer use it, and instead use 

finite_class.py (FiniteCombinatorialClass) is derived from CombinatorialClass, which has the comment:
   946     """
   947     This class is deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all derived
   948     classes in Sage's library will have been fixed. Please derive
   949     directly from Parent and use the category :class:`EnumeratedSets`,
   950     :class:`FiniteEnumeratedSets`, or :class:`InfiniteEnumeratedSets`, as
   951     appropriate.

We should have a similar type of comment under finite_class.py which directs them to use/develop FiniteEnumeratedSets instead........

Ouch, I did not intend to change the owner to "was"! Not sure how to fix it now; I seem to be unable to remodify. Anyway, I only hope I have not done any harm.
