I think it is better to have the comment on the other side.

```diff
-        elem = [[top]] # Make a list of lists of elements in the interval divided by rank.
-                       # List will be flattened at the end
+        elem = [[top]]
+        # Make a list of lists of elements in the interval divided by rank.
+        # List will be flattened at the end
```


Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
