Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: pari sig_on interrupt exception

From `sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx`:


```
# unfortunately I can't get signal handling to be good enough
# to properly catch error (and clean up) when trying to
# compute inverse, so we have to compute rank.  This does add
# time... (!) :-(
```
