Vanilla glpk 4.65 frequently prints a warning message "Long-step dual simplex will be used". Sage patches its glpk to skip this, and some distros use a patched glpk as well, but not all of them. For the systems where there is only an unpatched glpkg, we should ignore this warning message in doctesting.

By the way, I see (with and without the ticket):

```
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx", line 2287, in sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend.print_ranges
Failed example:
    p.print_ranges()
Expected:
    glp_print_ranges: optimal basic solution required
    1
Got:
    1

this is perhaps one more message to add to ignoring list.
Probably due to glpk not built with GMP support, IIRC.
