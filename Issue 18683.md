this would fix some bugs, e.g. as reported [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/OJAN4pk4dwQ/FJRxra67EbwJ).

 * get Maxima [here](https://github.com/andrejv/maxima) (then `git checkout 5.36.0.1`) and
 * ECL [here](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl.git).

For info, I have been using ecl 15.3.7 for a while in sage-on-gentoo. That part is a straight upgrade as far as I can see. I do not remember having tried a newer maxima but it usually breaks a lest a couple of doctest.

I tried maxima 5.36.0 and reverted (that was with ecl 15.3.7) , not tried 5.36.1 (5.36.0.1 whatever the version number is actually).

The branch is currently not working; to build the new ecl pkg, one has to move `patches/implib.patch` out of the way; I tried porting the latter patch to the new ecl, but it produces a makefile error that I don't understand; anyway, it is cygwin-specific.

I cc its author now. J.-P., any ideas?

What I don't understand is whether some patches are in fact results of running autoconf/automake/aclocal on patched configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc. 

If yes, then these should be split from the "real" ones to allow for fully automatic creation (and commands needed to run autotools need to be spelled out somewhere in the pkg docs). If no, then I don't see the point of patching configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc in the first place.

Look at spkg_src. autotools are not run. But may be the impl platch was copied from an autotool run. The gmp patch deals with the removal of gmp sources from the upstream tarball (the configure script of ecl checks for stuff in that subdirectory so those checks have to be diverted). the impl patch deals with cygwin stuff.

Getting real autoconf patch and running autotools wouldn't be a bad idea but that means you will need to have autotools installed to run spkg-src. spkg-src will need to be amended accordingly.

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-07-19 10:10:21

I notice that the gmp patch is against `configure.ac` while implib is against `configure.in` the last one is probably wrong.

spkg-src is outdated anyway.

No, I mean that it is silly and error-prone to rebase by hand patches that are better obtained directly from diffs to output of autoconf/automake/aclocal.

The latter should not be bundled together with the "real" one.

Sorry I have been too busy today to look further into this. I can reproduce your problem with your branch on my mac. I haven't quite identified yet the guilty makefile. I think the problem is not in the top makefile but in one of the subfolders but I haven't identified which one yet.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-07-20 08:37:35

To complete the answer you got from upstream: automake is not used (not a crime) but ecl also ship some of its dependencies in the pristine tarball and those come with their own build systems which can use automake. Apart from `ffi` we don't want to care about these I think.

Comment by dimpase created at 2015-07-20 11:27:52

arrghh, that was me mixing of tabs and spaces in `src/Makefile.in` patch...
Now all seems to work. I'll post an update soon.

OK, and for the record, `src/configure` is generated by autoreconf, that is, one does not need to rebase the corresponding patch manually.

Is it easy to fix?

No, it is not very easy to fix. We rewrite `li[n](` to `polylog(n,` and the same for `psi[n](` to `psi(n,`. This string matching obviously completely breaks if maxima starts spelling this as `(li[n])(x)`. Quite frankly, that's an insane spelling, so perhaps the preferred approach is to clarify with the maxima folks if they really intend this. It might be an unforeseen byproduct of some other change that they prefer to fix themselves, in which case we shouldn't waste time.

If they insist this is a reasonable spelling, I think we can work around it, but it'll be a bit of real work. Note that we can handle calls to parenthesized functions:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
sage: sefms('(sin)(x)')
sin(x)
```

so as long as we ensure that expressions like `li[n]` and `psi[n]` themselves get parsed to callable functions, we should be OK. Something like this would be OK:

```
sage: sefms('li[n]')
curried_polylog(n)
sage: sefms('li[n]')(x)
polylog(n,x)
sage: sefms('(li[n])(x)')
polylog(n,x)
```

Since we cannot really handle square brackets, we'd need to do the `li[n]`->`curried_polylog(n)` via a string substitution, but that should be OK. The `curried_polylog(n)` would just create a symbolic function that, when called with a single argument, would create the appropriate polylog.

The binary conversion `sr_to_max` in `maxima_lib.py`  shouldn't be affected, unless they have changed their internal representation of polylogarithms.

This is bad:

```


Bootstrapping should ideally be done by upstream. Alternatively, it should be done in `spkg-src`, but certainly not in `spkg-install`. Autotools are not a Sage prerequisite.

I am acutely aware of this; upstream is not doing bootstrapping in the release in question.
Also, note that the ticket status is "new". I'll sort this out after the bigger issues are fixed.

with sf.net back online, one finds there version 5.36.1. Not sure yet how much different it is from 5.36.0.1, which is not official...

5.36.1 has the same issue with too many ()...

They say the change is a [by-product to fix another bug](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2998/#09b6). Obviously it is a low priority for them to make the output backwards compatible. I wonder if we should just fully switch to `maxima_lib.py` and do not try to deal with this in some other way?

Robert isn't making any statement there about priority. I would not think it's a very low priority, because the current behaviour is tantamount to writing `(sin)(x)`, which is silly. I would not be surprised if in the next couple of weeks, when he has had a chance to think about a solution, he will have a fix. I'm sure it's not hard to fix. It just needs some thought to fix it properly and efficiently.

In terms of total amount of work, I would think introducing "curried" poylog and psi will be less work than eliminating any dependence on string parsing from maxima.

For calculus use, we're already moved entirely to maxima_lib. The library instance just allows two interfaces back and forth: a strings-based one and the binary `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr` one.
Moving calculus entirely to `sr_to_max` is a nice idea in general, and that's a worthwhile project that should be quite doable (we're halfway there already and it didn't take much work to do that).
It would mean identifying all remaining places where calculus triggers string conversions and replace those sites with mechanisms comparable to sr_integral, sr_limit, sr_sum etc.

I think it's worthwhile if somehow we do maintain the pexpect interface to maxima as well, even if we don't need it for the calculus functionality in sage proper (and since the strings-based interface in maxima_lib shares nearly all its code with that, we might as well keep that too). Having the pexpect interfaces in sage is a useful feature for communicating with other computer algebra systems.

he replied, saying that he does not see a way to fix this, and that Sage has to put up with this for the time being. 

I'd rather see this fixed im maxima, of course, but this is probably a nontrivial job for a Lisp hacker we don't have...

Quick workaround:

```
ecl_eval("(defprop $LI 210 rbp)")
ecl_eval("(defprop $PSI 210 rbp)")
```

it certainly avoids the extra parentheses around `li` and `psi` invocations. I've reported this workaround on the maxima bugtracker too. Hopefully Robert will comment there about any possible adverse effects. Including these statements in the maxima_calculus initialization in `maxima_lib.py` might do the trick (and possibly the change is accepted upstream!)

*EDIT:* A better and more universal change is probably:

```
ecl_eval("(defprop MFUNCTION 190 lbp)")
```

This way it applies to all "MQAPPLY" calls. That could be problematic, of course, but it doesn't seem to be, probably because 190 is still high enough. Things go wrong if you go too low:

```
sage: maxima_calculus("(a+b)(t)")
(b+a)(t)
sage: ecl_eval("(defprop MFUNCTION 1 lbp)")
<ECL: 1>
sage: maxima_calculus("(a+b)(t)")
b+a(t)
```

Comment by nbruin created at 2015-08-05 20:14:56

Of course, the expression type that gets constructed for `li` and `psi` is more general:

```
sage: maxima_calculus("a[1](x)")
a[1](x)
sage: maxima_calculus("a[1](x)").ecl()
<ECL: ((MQAPPLY SIMP) (($A SIMP ARRAY) 1) $X)>
```

but we already fail with that (because we carefully only convert `li[` and `psi[`):

```
sage: SR(maxima_calculus("a[1](x)"))
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'a[1](x)' in Sage
```

Since square brackets are really part of Maxima's expression syntax, the proper solution would be to have a parser that can handle them. The following seems valid maxima:

```
sage: maxima_calculus("(sin(x)+cos(y))[tan(u)[3/(a+b)]+log(w)](t)")
(cos(y)+sin(x))[log(w)+tan(u)[3/(b+a)]](t)
```

and parsing that with anything less than parser support for `[` will be. Of course, without `[]` support on the side of pynac, we'd have to parse `a[n]` to something like `get_item(a,n)` but that would be fine (and then `get_item` can have the right logic to actually resolve in relevant cases, but this would be more an extension of our symbolic expressions before it's a parsing issue for maxima)

The maxima ticket [https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2998/](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2998/) is now marked as resolved, so with any luck, the extra parentheses issue will not occur with the new maxima release.

The fix implemented is indeed `ecl_eval("(defprop MFUNCTION 190 lbp)")`, so if you do not want to wait for the next maxima release, just put this command in the initialization section of `maxima_lib`.

I tried upgrading to Maxima 5.37.0 (released 17 August).  The formatting problem is fixed, although some of the output still looks slightly different (more/fewer parentheses, different ordering of terms in some polynomials).

However, there is a serious bug in the function `eigenvectors` causing too few eigenvectors to be returned:

```
(%i1) M: matrix([1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 2]);
                                  [ 1  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
(%o1)                             [ 0  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ 0  0  2 ]
```

Maxima 5.35.1 computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors correctly:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)           [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [This is the Trac macro *[1, 0, 0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#[1, 0, 0-macro), [This is the Trac macro *0, 0, 1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0, 0, 1-macro)]]
```

In Maxima 5.37.0, the eigenvector `[0, 0, 1]` is missing:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)                  [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [This is the Trac macro *[1, 0, 0* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#[1, 0, 0-macro)]]
```

I found this out through several doctest failures in Sage.

It seems that version 5.38 was released a few months ago, and we are currently at 5.35.1. I think we can upgrade now since the reported bug was fixed.

Note that the bug fix is only in the development branch, not in 5.38.1.  We can of course add the relevant upstream commit (3e4e107) as a patch.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-26 20:53:29

Shall we then move forward then with upgrading to 5.38.1 with backporting 3e4e107 as a patch? Or should we ask the Maxima team to see how close they are to cutting a 5.38.2?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-08-29 10:06:21

it's about time. Should I have a go at it?


---

Comment by thansen created at 2016-10-27 12:36:58

Please do. We have to make sagemath 7.4 work with maxima 5.38.1 in Debian and it would help if we had a patch that we could backport.

So far, only the relevant commits from the old branch are rebased. I still have to fix patches to Maxima sources -- they don't apply cleanly.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-28 01:34:46

We'll also want to move to maxima 5.38.1 at least.

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-10-28 05:05:15

this seems to be a change:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py", line 210, in sage.interfaces.maxima
Failed example:
    g.taylor('x', 0, 3)
Expected:
    x+x^3/6+(3*x^5)/40+(5*x^7)/112+(35*x^9)/1152
Got:
    f/(k^4*x^4)-(2*f)/((3*k^2)*x^2)+(11*f)/45-((62*k^2*f)*x^2)/945
```

there `f` is defined as `f=maxima(`1/x^2`)`, so this no longer works, defining maxima
functions this way.

Anyhow, I'm pushing the other doctest changes for this file, and few other.

the following looks to me like a regression (or perhaps it's not really, as if one picked the right branches of the corresponding complex variable functions, it would be correct) :

```
File "src/sage/calculus/tests.py", line 107, in sage.calculus.tests
Failed example:
    integrate(log(1-x^2)/x, x)
Expected:
    1/2*log(x^2)*log(-x^2 + 1) + 1/2*polylog(2, -x^2 + 1)
Got:
    log(-x)*log(x + 1) + log(x)*log(-x + 1) + polylog(2, x + 1) + polylog(2, -x + 1)
```

and another regression of sorts: despite `besselexpand` set to False, one gets

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py", line 66, in sage.interfaces.maxima_lib
Failed example:
    sum((-x)^n/(factorial(n)*factorial(n+3/2)),n,0,oo)
Expected:
    bessel_J(3/2, 2*sqrt(x))/x^(3/4)
Got:
    -1/2*(2*x*cos(2*sqrt(x)) - sqrt(x)*sin(2*sqrt(x)))/(sqrt(pi)*x^2)
```


Perhaps it's a deficiency of our test, which is too simple for `besselexpand` to kick in.

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-10-28 13:31:29

and this one is puzzling on the Sage side:

```

Failed example:
    _ = integrate(y, x, -1000, 1000)

```

and comes from a regression in Maxima/ECL version combo (I did check that with Maxima 5.38.1 running on SBCL 1.3.6 this integral computes just fine).

this one needs an expert opinion:

```
File "src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py", line 853, in sage.schemes.projective.projective_morphism.SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space.dynatomic_polynomial
Failed example:
    f.dynatomic_polynomial(2)

Got:
    2.00000000000000*x^2 + 0.999999999999999*y^2
```

The output is clearly different, but perhaps it's OK, I don't know---I suspect it's OK, as we must be interested in the projective points where it vanishes(?) - documentation talks about "roots" though, and these, projectively, remain the same.

Robert Dodier has traced this down to a problem with ECL, see
https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/299

ECL has a problem comparing their own (there is no Common Lisp standard for this)

this workaround turned out to be buggy, and anyway ECL has released a fix for this problem, making the workaround not necessary. (But it would need an update of our ECL package, as it does depend upon a number of changes, see https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/299; they promise a new release by the end of the year). 

Should we wait, or should we proceed?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-08 15:09:30

I think we should either backport the fix as a patch to ECL or perhaps take a development cut.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-11-08 15:12:34

I would go for the first option which looks easier: just put the ECL patch into `build/pkgs/ecl/patches`.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-11-08 15:13:38

There is the issue that you have to force an ECL rebuild. Add a `p(n+1)` suffix in `package-version.txt`?

Replying to [comment:73 jpflori]:

a single patch is not  enough. In fact, it hangs the ECL build if I do this. ECL people say the have worked on a number of related things, that is support of IEEE floats, since the release, so the latest fix relies on these. A proper ECL update is the only way I think.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-11-08 22:29:01

We may have to wait. I could try a git snapshot in sage-on-gentoo to see how things are going but I am overloaded as it is. I have to draw the line somewhere.

Comment by infinity0 created at 2016-11-12 19:26:54

Hi, we're following this ticket very closely in Debian. I notice that the following two patches are still applicable to 5.38.1:

* https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/0001-taylor2-Avoid-blowing-the-stack-when-diff-expand-isn.patch
* https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/matrixexp.patch

Have these patches been forwarded upstream yet? Would they be suitable for other users of Maxima, or are they only useful for Sage?

this one comes from upstream, from here: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2520/#e3a5
(so it's sort of unfinished digging on the maxima side; it's definitely useful outside of Sage)

this is also from upstream (updated somewhat):
https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/

again, upstream still has it open.

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

Some of these doctests are solely Maxima's regressions, one is fixable via a ECL update.
I can just mark them appropriately and proceed, if this is acceptable.

This is both #17892 and #20191, because the result changed, presumably to something more correct that needs these symbolic functions we don't have atm.

I think this one is a new Maxima bug: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3237/ - still under investigation by Maxima people.

That's odd. The doctest skipped to the next result line which is of course different.

Looking more closely, I agree.

`ecl` 16.1.3 is out. I haven't checked yet if all we want is in there but I will look int it.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-12-20 07:21:55

If possible, do the ECL upgrade in a new ticket.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-12-20 08:25:05

Considering the havoc it wrecks in the building of the documentation it deserves its own ticket. Surprisingly, I haven't spotted `libecl` in the numerous backtraces produced before the build petered out. But that's the only thing I changed from one successful build to this one.

This works at the prompt (with a good plot, too):

but dumps core in testing:

I think I need an idea what's wrong here, before being able to go forward. This discrepancy between testsuite vs prompt is really odd.

here is a bad one - reproducible on two different systems;
I don't understand what's going on here; it appears that computing `g(x)`,
the Taylor expansion of `log(x)`, breaks `log(x)` plotting (in case the leftmost
interval point is 0).

Probably this initialises some symbolics, breaking handling of infinity in the
process...

Further entry point - the crash does not happen if I revert back to ECL 16.1.2.
(and keep new Maxima version).
That is, it seems that the call to `taylor` loads ecl+maxima, and sets up some stuff
that is responsible for handling infinities.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-01-16 22:53:14

I think a number of things point back to `ecl-16.1.3` so it may belong to #22191. I remember having a lot of similar stuff when changing just `ecl` without change `maxima` (still need a rebuild though) in sage-on-gentoo. Right now I am just locked on 16.1.2.

still a couple of SIGFPEs to figure out, but otherwise does not look too bad. I'll post ptestlong results later today.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-01-17 16:00:18

SIGFPEs are of the same sort as above:

```
sage: g(x)=taylor(log(x),x,1,6) # this initialises ECL/Maxima
sage: q = (2^53) * 2^971/1
sage: float(q) # boom, instead of "inf" as the answer.
...
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred.
...
```

which I traced down to the call to `ldexp` at `sage/rings/rational.pyx:3799`.
Note that this is with `​ac8348c	` commit already in (and so `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE` = 0), so there is more of the same kind of story as above, but harder. I don't see what's going wrong here now.

This is a different to division by 0 kind of FPE, so this is perhaps the reason.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-01-17 16:02:09

ecl-16.1.3+Maxima 5.39.0


---

Attachment

I've decided to stick to ECL 16.1.2 for this ticket. (ECL 16.1.3 has a problem that cannot be fixed quickly, and benefits of using it here are pretty minimal).

With this branch, the following remains to be fixed (or marked as known bugs):

1) this appears to be a Maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3276/):

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
******************************************************************
****
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 10600, in sage.symbo
lic.expression.Expression.solve

    [Q == 1/sqrt(-sqrt(2) + 1), Q == 1/sqrt(sqrt(2) + 1)]
Got:
    [Q == -sqrt(-sqrt(2) - 1)]
```


2) this is weird (sage interface problem?) --- scratch this, it's a typo!

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py
******************************************************************

**********************************************************************
```


3) this looks like a maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3275/):

```

Got:
    log(-x)*log(x + 1) + log(x)*log(-x + 1) + dilog(x + 1) + dilog(-x + 1)
```


4) this is a known Maxima issue [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3237/):

Instead of removing this doctest:

         In some cases there may be infinitely many solutions indexed
         by a dummy variable.  If it begins with ``z``, it is implicitly
```

I would instead mark the previous solution as `# known bug` or at least keep the solution. Same in `calculus/tests.py`.

On Debian testing (Core i7 + 16 GB Ram), on a branch where R 3.2.2 is merged with the latest released Sage, a parallel test (`MAKE="make -j8"`) gives :

This latter bug is known, not really a bug and has its own ticket.

Furthermore, Maxima 5.38.1 (Debian testing current version) fixes one of my pet peeves :


```

                                      /2
```


Whereas Sage's Maxima gives :

```

taylor: unable to expand at a point specified in:
'integrate(f(x),x)
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
```


So, we have :
* already known problems with parallel testing ;
* one already reported and ticketed test failure ;
* one not already reported problem, that continues the previous behaviour of Maxima-in-Sage, whereas this behavior has been fixed in 5.38.1.

None of these seem to impede giving this ticket a `positive_review`. Which I'd do unless you think that the behavior of the `taylor(integrate(...)...)` should/could be fixed with this issue.

However, I think the objection of Thierry Scrim (?) valid, and I think it is more important, since it points out a case where Maxima's answer is incomplete. Hence ==>`needs_work`.

Actually I believe Maxima is not to blame here, and in the bug report the dev says "not technically incorrect". See #17892 for our symbolic limit ticket.

As a minor point, when reviewing documentation tickets I always ask that lines be kept to about the same length. I would appreciate if you could break the long lines here, especially in the tutorials. Thanks.

This time, three failures in a parallel `ptestlong` :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 110.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 110.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 110.0 src/sage/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


Olny the firs one persists when run standalone, and is our old aquaintance... The other two are transient (race conditions ?)

Since the explanation given in #22191 show that the problem I signaled before is in ECL's realm, not Maxima's, there is no reason not to give this a `positive_review`.

Aaaaahhhhh !

what? so it did quietly vanish? IMHO the whole git tree is fcked:

```
$ git push trac HEAD:public/maxima5390bis 
error: unable to push to unqualified destination: public/maxima5390bis
The destination refspec neither matches an existing ref on the remote nor
begins with refs/, and we are unable to guess a prefix based on the source ref.
error: failed to push some refs to 'git`@`trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
```


EDIT: this went through on a 3rd attempt

Could please a reviewer compare the new branch with the old one he has locally? E.g. as follows:

```
git fetch trac public/maxima5390bis
git diff FETCH_HEAD trac/public/maxima5390
```

if this `diff` returns nothing we're good to go.


---

Comment by charpent created at 2017-01-21 19:01:59

I use git-trac (nice !...), so I did :

```
charpent`@`asus16-ec:/usr/local/sage-7$ git fetch trac public/maxima5390bis
Depuis git://trac.sagemath.org/sage
 * branch                  public/maxima5390bis -> FETCH_HEAD
charpent`@`asus16-ec:/usr/local/sage-7$ git diff FETCH_HEAD t/18920/public/maxima5390 
charpent`@`asus16-ec:/usr/local/sage-7$ 
```

So, unless I'm mistaken, "we're good to go"...

HTH,

It says `makeinfo not found`. Great, we always had a few for maxima's documentation but I thought `makeinfo` was a requisite.

I cannot find anything there, the interface is pretty impossible to use for me.
Can I have a link to the log file I can download?

I'd say, just add `makeinfo` to the list of pre-reqs.
It has been necessary to have it to build Maxima 
for years, see e.g. https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2878/

And it looks like the latter Maxima ticket did not fix anything :-)

I think we may have some workaround by touching the right file. It is not in the current spkg-install, so we have dropped it at some point. You are right to point to upstream that they have a regression. For info:

perhaps our workound + Maxima's workarond + no makeinfo == error... :)

I'll check this.

I am not convinced whether it's at all possible to build Maxima 5.39.0 and its docs without `makeinfo`. We are on our own here, as the official upstream pre-req for the build includes autotools.

Instead of wasting time on this academic issue, I'd like to rather include `makeinfo` into Sage pre-reqs.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-01-22 15:52:52

I have opened a new [Maxima ticket](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3278/) on the `makeinfo` question.

Seconded, on basic principles :

[ The following rant is not gratuitous. It's just a lemma. Bear with me for a while... ]

Our "batteries included" so-called philosophy has pushed us to include more and more software of peripheral interest at best up to the point where Sage is now a small-scale, highly specialized Linux distribution.

This distribution is of great interest to sage **builders** (i. e. potential developpers). It is at best an hindrance (read "pain in the *ss") to what should be one of our primary targets : the potential **users** of Sage. And no, this cannot be restricted to research mathematicians specializing in number theory...

For example, going to the pain to build our own GCC collection seems to me pushing consistency exigences a bit too far. Requiring from an //installer// (i. e. potential developper) to take the pain to install a matching set of decently recent compilers does not sound too much to me.

Corollary : our **binary** tarballs/packages should be sound enough to satisfy the largest possible number of potential **users**. That means that our users should not be requested to install and manage a virtual machine setup, nor a complicated installation on "exotic" platforms. An undergraduate or even high school student, a practising engineer, etc... should be able to install a precompiled binary and go use Sage as he uses a word processor, without having to install a $#!+load of tools he/she'll never use for anything else.

Therefore, if we need autotools to build Maxima, let's use existing autotools distributions, and do not try to avoid it. Or maintaining our own port. Maintaining our ports should be limited to the cases where there is a mathematical reason to do so.

[ End of rant. Now for its consequences : ]

Therefore, I think that wiggling away from one more tool to build Sage amounts to trying to alleviate the load of **developers**. Which is the wrong target. Our primary goal should be to alleviate the load  imposed on **users**.

Those two sets were largely overlapping in the begionning of Sage, which as long been targeted on a certain research community. This is no longer the case. Sage now needs a lot of **users**, able to report problems, if we want to be able to fix them.

So, in the present case, if autotools is needed to build Maxima, let's depend on it **for building Sage**. But users of a binary distribution of Sage should not have to bother themselves with that.

In other (shorter) words : I'm not bothered by one more build dependency, if I can lighten the run dependencies... This seems the case here.

Corollary : the time spent on arguing and nitpicking over autotools would have been better spent helping Eric Bray's Cygwin port //cum// Windows installer, which opens us a quite large pool of potential users...

autotools are not needed to build Maxima, but makeinfo apparently is. 

Perhaps one can build Maxima without makeinfo if autotools are available, I didn't check, for this is even more academic question...
 
makeinfo is a very easy pre-req, as it is available on every system we build Sage on, and included in XCode too.

I think this is enough. 

I have now re-introduced the `makeinfo` workaround and my logs says it is safe to use on a `makeinfo`-less system.

I appreciate the feeling Emmanuel but the place for it is sage-devel - of course nothing is likely to happen for it in the short term. The reality is now there are plenty of "user space" package management solution around (not so many when sage was started) and most of them do a better job than the sage packaging system. The other reality is those other packaging system usually don't play well with sage. We pick problems regularly from users with a default installation of brew on OS X for example.

Users of binary distributions of Sage should still be able to install optional and experimental packages. Since there is no binary distribution of optional packages, build-time tools need to be included.

I would propose to add a standard package that includes (a current version of) texinfo (which provides makeinfo). Note that our autotools spkg packages only an ancient version of texinfo (4.13) (see #21196 for a discussion).

It should not be; the bug is that the necessary TeX files are not included in the tarball.  Even if the user does not have makeinfo, there should be no problem because the configure script will set $(MAKEINFO) to a command that does nothing.  There is at least one place where a Maxima makefile uses `makeinfo` instead of `$(MAKEINFO)`.  In #17514 I fixed this specific one, but I seem to remember another problem of this kind in newer Maxima versions.  Anyway, the only way to really fix this is if the Maxima developers make sure that all TeX files are in the distribution.

I have got a funny failing doctest in sage-on-gentoo but I am not completely sure this ticket is responsible (I am testing from the current develop branch of Volker's fork where he is testing this now)

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/functions/special.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/functions/special.py", line 232, in sage.functions.special.SphericalHarmonic._eval_
Failed example:
    spherical_harmonic(3,2,1,2*pi/3)
Expected:
    1/240*sqrt(30)*(-15*I*sqrt(7)*sqrt(3)
     - 15*sqrt(7))*cos(1)*sin(1)^2/sqrt(pi)
Got:
    -1/240*sqrt(30)*(15*I*sqrt(7)*sqrt(3) + 15*sqrt(7))*cos(1)*sin(1)^2/sqrt(pi)
**********************************************************************
```

As you can see they are actually identical...
