What I don't understand is whether some patches are in fact results of running autoconf/automake/aclocal on patched configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc. 

If yes, then these should be split from the "real" ones to allow for fully automatic creation (and commands needed to run autotools need to be spelled out somewhere in the pkg docs). If no, then I don't see the point of patching configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc in the first place.

Look at spkg_src. autotools are not run. But may be the impl platch was copied from an autotool run. The gmp patch deals with the removal of gmp sources from the upstream tarball (the configure script of ecl checks for stuff in that subdirectory so those checks have to be diverted). the impl patch deals with cygwin stuff.

Getting real autoconf patch and running autotools wouldn't be a bad idea but that means you will need to have autotools installed to run spkg-src. spkg-src will need to be amended accordingly.

No, I mean that it is silly and error-prone to rebase by hand patches that are better obtained directly from diffs to output of autoconf/automake/aclocal.

The latter should not be bundled together with the "real" one.

No, it is not very easy to fix. We rewrite `li[n](` to `polylog(n,` and the same for `psi[n](` to `psi(n,`. This string matching obviously completely breaks if maxima starts spelling this as `(li[n])(x)`. Quite frankly, that's an insane spelling, so perhaps the preferred approach is to clarify with the maxima folks if they really intend this. It might be an unforeseen byproduct of some other change that they prefer to fix themselves, in which case we shouldn't waste time.

If they insist this is a reasonable spelling, I think we can work around it, but it'll be a bit of real work. Note that we can handle calls to parenthesized functions:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
sage: sefms('(sin)(x)')
sin(x)
```

so as long as we ensure that expressions like `li[n]` and `psi[n]` themselves get parsed to callable functions, we should be OK. Something like this would be OK:

```
sage: sefms('li[n]')
curried_polylog(n)
sage: sefms('li[n]')(x)
polylog(n,x)
sage: sefms('(li[n])(x)')
polylog(n,x)
```

Since we cannot really handle square brackets, we'd need to do the `li[n]`->`curried_polylog(n)` via a string substitution, but that should be OK. The `curried_polylog(n)` would just create a symbolic function that, when called with a single argument, would create the appropriate polylog.

The binary conversion `sr_to_max` in `maxima_lib.py`  shouldn't be affected, unless they have changed their internal representation of polylogarithms.

with sf.net back online, one finds there version 5.36.1. Not sure yet how much different it is from 5.36.0.1, which is not official...

5.36.1 has the same issue with too many ()...

In terms of total amount of work, I would think introducing "curried" poylog and psi will be less work than eliminating any dependence on string parsing from maxima.

For calculus use, we're already moved entirely to maxima_lib. The library instance just allows two interfaces back and forth: a strings-based one and the binary `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr` one.
Moving calculus entirely to `sr_to_max` is a nice idea in general, and that's a worthwhile project that should be quite doable (we're halfway there already and it didn't take much work to do that).
It would mean identifying all remaining places where calculus triggers string conversions and replace those sites with mechanisms comparable to sr_integral, sr_limit, sr_sum etc.

I think it's worthwhile if somehow we do maintain the pexpect interface to maxima as well, even if we don't need it for the calculus functionality in sage proper (and since the strings-based interface in maxima_lib shares nearly all its code with that, we might as well keep that too). Having the pexpect interfaces in sage is a useful feature for communicating with other computer algebra systems.

Quick workaround:

```
ecl_eval("(defprop $LI 210 rbp)")
ecl_eval("(defprop $PSI 210 rbp)")
```

it certainly avoids the extra parentheses around `li` and `psi` invocations. I've reported this workaround on the maxima bugtracker too.

Of course, the expression type that gets constructed for `li` and `psi` is more general:

```
sage: maxima_calculus("a[1](x)")
a[1](x)
sage: maxima_calculus("a[1](x)").ecl()
<ECL: ((MQAPPLY SIMP) (($A SIMP ARRAY) 1) $X)>
```

but we already fail with that (because we carefully only convert `li[` and `psi[`):

```
sage: SR(maxima_calculus("a[1](x)"))
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'a[1](x)' in Sage
```

Since square brackets are really part of Maxima's expression syntax, the proper solution would be to have a parser that can handle them. The following seems valid maxima:

```
sage: maxima_calculus("(sin(x)+cos(y))[tan(u)[3/(a+b)]+log(w)](t)")
(cos(y)+sin(x))[log(w)+tan(u)[3/(b+a)]](t)
```

and parsing that with anything less than parser support for `[` will be. Of course, without `[]` support on the side of pynac, we'd have to parse `a[n]` to something like `get_item(a,n)` but that would be fine (and then `get_item` can have the right logic to actually resolve in relevant cases, but this would be more an extension of our symbolic expressions before it's a parsing issue for maxima)

I tried upgrading to Maxima 5.37.0 (released 17 August).  The formatting problem is fixed, although some of the output still looks slightly different (more/fewer parentheses, different ordering of terms in some polynomials).

However, there is a serious bug in the function `eigenvectors` causing too few eigenvectors to be returned:

```
(%i1) M: matrix([1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 2]);
                                  [ 1  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
(%o1)                             [ 0  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ 0  0  2 ]
```

Maxima 5.35.1 computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors correctly:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)           [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[[1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 1]]]]
```

In Maxima 5.37.0, the eigenvector `[0, 0, 1]` is missing:

```
(%i2) eigenvectors(M);
(%o2)                  [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[[1, 0, 0]]]]
```

I found this out through several doctest failures in Sage.

there `f` is defined as `f=maxima(`1/x^2`)`, so this no longer works, defining maxima
functions this way.

Anyhow, I'm pushing the other doctest changes for this file, and few other.

this workaround turned out to be buggy, and anyway ECL has released a fix for this problem, making the workaround not necessary. (But it would need an update of our ECL package, as it does depend upon a number of changes, see https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/299; they promise a new release by the end of the year). 

Should we wait, or should we proceed?

I think we should either backport the fix as a patch to ECL or perhaps take a development cut.

There is the issue that you have to force an ECL rebuild. Add a `p(n+1)` suffix in `package-version.txt`?

a single patch is not  enough. In fact, it hangs the ECL build if I do this. ECL people say the have worked on a number of related things, that is support of IEEE floats, since the release, so the latest fix relies on these. A proper ECL update is the only way I think.

We may have to wait. I could try a git snapshot in sage-on-gentoo to see how things are going but I am overloaded as it is. I have to draw the line somewhere.

Hi, we're following this ticket very closely in Debian. I notice that the following two patches are still applicable to 5.38.1:

* https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/0001-taylor2-Avoid-blowing-the-stack-when-diff-expand-isn.patch
* https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/matrixexp.patch

Have these patches been forwarded upstream yet? Would they be suitable for other users of Maxima, or are they only useful for Sage?

this one comes from upstream, from here: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2520/#e3a5
(so it's sort of unfinished digging on the maxima side; it's definitely useful outside of Sage)



> * https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/maxima/patches/matrixexp.patch

this is also from upstream (updated somewhat):
https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2596/

again, upstream still has it open.

Some of these doctests are solely Maxima's regressions, one is fixable via a ECL update.

This works at the prompt (with a good plot, too):

```
sage: plot(bessel_Y(1,x), (x,0,5), color='blue')
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```

but dumps core in testing:

```
sage -t src/sage/functions/bessel.py
...

here is a bad one - reproducible on two different systems;
I don't understand what's going on here; it appears that computing `g(x)`,
the Taylor expansion of `log(x)`, breaks `log(x)` plotting (in case the leftmost
interval point is 0).

Probably this initialises some symbolics, breaking handling of infinity in the
process...

Further entry point - the crash does not happen if I revert back to ECL 16.1.2.
(and keep new Maxima version).
That is, it seems that the call to `taylor` loads ecl+maxima, and sets up some stuff
that is responsible for handling infinities.

SIGFPEs are of the same sort as above:

```
sage: g(x)=taylor(log(x),x,1,6) # this initialises ECL/Maxima
sage: q = (2^53) * 2^971/1
sage: float(q) # boom, instead of "inf" as the answer.
...
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred.
...
```

which I traced down to the call to `ldexp` at `sage/rings/rational.pyx:3799`.
Note that this is with `​ac8348c	` commit already in (and so `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE` = 0), so there is more of the same kind of story as above, but harder. I don't see what's going wrong here now.

This is a different to division by 0 kind of FPE, so this is perhaps the reason.

With this branch, the following remains to be fixed (or marked as known bugs):

1) this appears to be a Maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3276/):

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
******************************************************************
****
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 10600, in sage.symbo

Got:
    [Q == -sqrt(-sqrt(2) - 1)]
```


2) this is weird (sage interface problem?) --- scratch this, it's a typo!

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py
******************************************************************
****
File "src/sage/interfaces/maxima.py", line 210, in sage.interfaces

**********************************************************************
```


3) this looks like a maxima regression [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3275/):

```
sage -t src/sage/calculus/tests.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/calculus/tests.py", line 107, in sage.calculus.tests

Got:
    log(-x)*log(x + 1) + log(x)*log(-x + 1) + dilog(x + 1) + dilog(-x + 1)
```


4) this is a known Maxima issue [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3237/):

```

This latter bug is known, not really a bug and has its own ticket.

Furthermore, Maxima 5.38.1 (Debian testing current version) fixes one of my pet peeves :


```

Whereas Sage's Maxima gives :

taylor: unable to expand at a point specified in:

```


So, we have :
* already known problems with parallel testing ;
* one already reported and ticketed test failure ;
* one not already reported problem, that continues the previous behaviour of Maxima-in-Sage, whereas this behavior has been fixed in 5.38.1.

None of these seem to impede giving this ticket a `positive_review`. Which I'd do unless you think that the behavior of the `taylor(integrate(...)...)` should/could be fixed with this issue.

However, I think the objection of Thierry Scrim (?) valid, and I think it is more important, since it points out a case where Maxima's answer is incomplete. Hence ==>`needs_work`.

I am not convinced whether it's at all possible to build Maxima 5.39.0 and its docs without `makeinfo`. We are on our own here, as the official upstream pre-req for the build includes autotools.

Seconded, on basic principles :

[ The following rant is not gratuitous. It's just a lemma. Bear with me for a while... ]

Our "batteries included" so-called philosophy has pushed us to include more and more software of peripheral interest at best up to the point where Sage is now a small-scale, highly specialized Linux distribution.

This distribution is of great interest to sage **builders** (i. e. potential developpers). It is at best an hindrance (read "pain in the *ss") to what should be one of our primary targets : the potential **users** of Sage. And no, this cannot be restricted to research mathematicians specializing in number theory...

For example, going to the pain to build our own GCC collection seems to me pushing consistency exigences a bit too far. Requiring from an //installer// (i. e. potential developper) to take the pain to install a matching set of decently recent compilers does not sound too much to me.

Corollary : our **binary** tarballs/packages should be sound enough to satisfy the largest possible number of potential **users**. That means that our users should not be requested to install and manage a virtual machine setup, nor a complicated installation on "exotic" platforms. An undergraduate or even high school student, a practising engineer, etc... should be able to install a precompiled binary and go use Sage as he uses a word processor, without having to install a $#!+load of tools he/she'll never use for anything else.

Therefore, if we need autotools to build Maxima, let's use existing autotools distributions, and do not try to avoid it. Or maintaining our own port. Maintaining our ports should be limited to the cases where there is a mathematical reason to do so.

[ End of rant. Now for its consequences : ]

Therefore, I think that wiggling away from one more tool to build Sage amounts to trying to alleviate the load of **developers**. Which is the wrong target. Our primary goal should be to alleviate the load  imposed on **users**.

Those two sets were largely overlapping in the begionning of Sage, which as long been targeted on a certain research community. This is no longer the case. Sage now needs a lot of **users**, able to report problems, if we want to be able to fix them.

So, in the present case, if autotools is needed to build Maxima, let's depend on it **for building Sage**. But users of a binary distribution of Sage should not have to bother themselves with that.

In other (shorter) words : I'm not bothered by one more build dependency, if I can lighten the run dependencies... This seems the case here.

Corollary : the time spent on arguing and nitpicking over autotools would have been better spent helping Eric Bray's Cygwin port //cum// Windows installer, which opens us a quite large pool of potential users...

autotools are not needed to build Maxima, but makeinfo apparently is. 

Perhaps one can build Maxima without makeinfo if autotools are available, I didn't check, for this is even more academic question...
 
makeinfo is a very easy pre-req, as it is available on every system we build Sage on, and included in XCode too.

Users of binary distributions of Sage should still be able to install optional and experimental packages. Since there is no binary distribution of optional packages, build-time tools need to be included.

I would propose to add a standard package that includes (a current version of) texinfo (which provides makeinfo). Note that our autotools spkg packages only an ancient version of texinfo (4.13) (see #21196 for a discussion).
