Those bits should have gone when I "normalised" clang for building sage on OS X. We were probably planing to remove them at a later stage and forgot.

Well, the opportunity is clearly now.

When Apple's compiler is invoked as `clang` instead of `gcc`, it does not understand the same flags. So #27122 leads to build errors.

R does not use `-march=native` anyway.
`python/spkg-build.in` is set up a bit different. `$CFLAGS` contains other stuff and `$EXTRA_CFLAGS` is contains the old `$CFLAGS`, so we need to set `$EXTRA_CFLAGS`.

Anyway, I think the main problem is that we run `testcfags.sh` before setting the compiler.
We might as well run this for `$CFLAGS` as well after possibly changing the compiler.
