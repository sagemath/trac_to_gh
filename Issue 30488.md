Those bits should have gone when I "normalised" clang for building sage on OS X. We were probably planing to remove them at a later stage and forgot.

When Apple's compiler is invoked as `clang` instead of `gcc`, it does not understand the same flags. So #27122 leads to build errors.

That's right. The issue arises from the `spkg-install` scripts changing the compiler to `clang` and continuing to use CFLAGS that have been determined by the configure script for a different compiler (`/usr/bin/gcc`).

R does not use `-march=native` anyway.
`python/spkg-build.in` is set up a bit different. `$CFLAGS` contains other stuff and `$EXTRA_CFLAGS` is contains the old `$CFLAGS`, so we need to set `$EXTRA_CFLAGS`.

Anyway, I think the main problem is that we run `testcfags.sh` before setting the compiler.
We might as well run this for `$CFLAGS` as well after possibly changing the compiler.

My tests finished. Not very sucessfull though. Looks like zlib failed for many mac runs.

Also ubuntu-bionic-minimal and debian-buster-minimal failed because somehow ssl wasn't available and the pytest failed (or the server did not reply).
