Keywords: SR, CIF, representation

We have

```
sage: x+CIF(RIF(-2,2), 0)
x
```

and

```
sage: x + CIF(RIF(-2,2),RIF(-2,2))
x
```

which are wrong representation strings. Anyhow, the result themselves are correct since, for example, we have

```
sage: z = (x+CIF(RIF(-2,2),RIF(-2,2)))
sage: z - x
0.?e1 + 0.?e1*I
```


In contrast, the following things work:

```
sage: x+RIF(-2,2)
x + 0.?e1
sage: x+CIF(RIF(3.14,3.15), RIF(3.14, 3.15))
x + 3.15? + 3.15?*I
sage: CIF(RIF(-2,2),RIF(-2,2))
0.?e1 + 0.?e1*I
sage: x+CIF(RIF(3.14,3.15), 0)
x + 3.15?
```
