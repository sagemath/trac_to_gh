CC:  slelievre

this was reported to me by Alexandre Casamayou (checked with Sage 9.1):

```
sage: var('z')
sage: solve(i*z^2-2*conjugate(z)+2-i, z)                                        
[z == (-2*I - 1), z == 1]
```

The answer `z == (-2*I - 1)` is wrong, since it gives `-8*I` and not zero.

It turns out `solve` ignores `conjugate`.

No problem, thanks for reporting, better twice than not.
Duplicate tickets are cheap and easy to close.

I found the other ticket using Trac's query engine:

- tickets whose summary contains "solve": https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~solve
- then search for "conjugate" (with ctrl-F) in the page of results

The reverse works too:

- tickets whose summary contains "conjugate": https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~conjugate
- then search for "solve" (with ctrl-F) in the page of results

Otherwise searching for "solv" or "conjugat" would also catch
solving, conjugation...
