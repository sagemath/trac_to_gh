# Issue 18018: remove silly Brun constant

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2015-04-20 06:57:11

CC:  kcrisman

`brun` fails horribly:

```
sage: brun.n()
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun?
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun??
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
```

and this leads to sporadic failure of `random_expr`, falsifying patchbot test results.

Changing priority from critical to minor.

It makes patchbot runs useless. Certainly not minor.

Really, why?


---

Comment by rws created at 2015-05-11 13:13:13

As in the ticket description this leads to sporadic failure of random_expr.

This is not a sporadic random failure

Do you really want to remove the Brun constant itself? The problem is not with `brun`, the problem is with `LimitedPrecisionConstant`.


---

Comment by rws created at 2015-05-12 14:59:50

So we add `brun = whatever` in `all.py` and get bug reports when a new decimal place is discovered?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2015-05-12 15:05:43

The Brun constant looks like something that we have no idea about excepted its existence... Even the decimals given on oeis do not seem to be proven exact. Do you have a reference for the associated computations? If not, I would rather remove it.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-05-12 18:33:01

The decimals are certainly not proven correct, as far as I know it's even an open question whether `brun < 2`.

So I get your point...


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-12 19:31:26

Having it in Sage _is_ nice with regard to the Pentium bug, though... (that is, demonstrating even wacky theory has applications).

But then it should not be called `brun`. What about `brun_as_conjectured_by_XYZ`? If we had any way to compute it (even very slow) I would be happy to keep it.

It's not a conjecture, it's an estimate.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-12 20:37:29

I wonder how many failures it would make - running `TestSuite` would be instructive, if scary.

> The decimals are certainly not proven correct, as far as I know it's even an open question whether `brun < 2`.

Interesting!  (Do you have a reference?  I can only find references to estimates using twin primes < 10 to the something.)

Are there any (other?) constants known to some number of bits only of potential interest?  I bet there are, but maybe it's not worth keeping the class around for that.

(Deprecation?  Just asking.)

Wrong question. It should rather read: will I review and set positive if you add deprecation?


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-13 14:21:06

No, because I don't feel qualified to address the question of whether this class should exist.  I asked about deprecation because this would be a rather unusual case where the class may not have been meaningful enough to keep around even in deprecated format (bugs aren't deprecated).


---

Comment by rws created at 2015-05-13 14:31:48

If I understand correctly you are of the opinion that deprecation is likely not necessary. Well, I agree.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-13 14:37:00

On the other hand, perhaps someone should check first whether this is in other systems (think mission statement).  I'm not sure whether [this](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=brunâ€™s+constant) indicates anything about it in Mma or not.


---

Comment by rws created at 2015-05-13 14:53:22

You mean they have a named string that contains "`~2`"? Let's pretend they have, would we want to copy it?


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-15 17:21:46

Well, I just meant whatever they did have - perhaps just for reference.  But you are probably right, the whole class is probably not (currently) useful.  (But it could be later - maybe we could keep the class, not the constant, in as commented?  But again, I'm not feeling qualified to give positive review to any of that - I would certainly support e.g. Jeroen if he did, though.)

The class is buggy, which was the original reason that this ticket was created. If you remove the constant and keep the class, you are just hiding that problem.


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2015-05-18 12:22:14

I meant just to comment it out but keep it there in commented state so it would be easier for someone to fix.  But I don't really care that much, whatever `@`jdemeyer says is fine with me, because of the unusual case.  Where was this even added (rhetorical question)?

Yeah, Volker, the branch is green... can you at least let us know which ticket?

possibly with something that I unmerged, or maybe wrong ticket
