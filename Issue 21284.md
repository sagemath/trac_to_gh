Jeroen, does Cython make a difference between `range` and `xrange`? I recall reading that Cython special cases iterations `for i in range(x)` to `for(int i=0; i<x; ++i)` (possibly with a `cdef int i`).

The other changes look good to me.

Yes. I explained that on another ticket that I cannot recall.

Yes, this happens when the iteration variable is some C type.

But even for Python loops (where the iteration variable is a Python variable), `xrange()` is better than `range()` so that change makes sense anyway.

I will try to remember that. Hopefully Cython also special cases that like `range()`...
