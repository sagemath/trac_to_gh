At least a while ago, running ecllib in sage with thread support was rather fundamentally not possible: when threads are enabled, ecl will have a separate thread for signal handling (and garbage collection). Furthermore, it will use some very strange signals for syncing processes around garbage collection.

Sage will swap signal handlers when entering/exiting ecllib. That's fundamentally incompatible with a multi-threaded approach.

I think before changing the doctest to just pass, I think you should submit some evidence that these problems do not arise anymore. We could even extend the doctests to more properly test if garbage collection in ecl acts nicely with multithreading in sage now (I have trouble imagining how it could).

Good news! I looked up the particular configuration option:

https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/static/manual/re97.html#table.boot_options

and it's only the *signal number* that would be used for thread communication in ECL, should multiple threads exist. I don't think we ever should have multiple threads in ECL within sage, because the signal handling would get completely screwed up. However, this option doesn't particularly seem to influence whether we do. I think it might be a bit of a red flag if this option does have a special value (because it might indicate an ECL build that has thread support), but that in itself is not necessarily indicative of problems. Also, with the work on #11752 it seems that just having thread support in ECL built doesn't necessarily trigger problems. So it might be OK to not test this option.

On the other hand, "ECL_OPT_SIGNAL_HANDLING_THREAD" really should be checked to be 0. If it isn't we can really expect trouble.
