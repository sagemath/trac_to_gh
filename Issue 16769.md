as the title says, the index of plane curves is a long list, which we should split up so that it is easier to navigate.

I wrote it on top of #16806 to avoid merging problems.

I really only restructured the index of plane_curves. Included one more file lseries_ell and made a few cosmetic changes. 

Of course, it is not perfect, but it is an improvement and for now that is what I am willing to put in as time to improve it.
