In this ticket, we fix most of the compilation warnings that can be seen while running `./sage -b` after touching `sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi`.

We can certainly do better as I'm not completely sure of the best types to choose.
Also, for many modules, we could go deeper and change the type of some variables that are not well chosen.

Some warnings are remaining, like "unreachable code" and "incompatible pointer types" that should be fixed in another ticket.
