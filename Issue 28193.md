# Issue 28193: Polyhedron: Preserve backend for barycentric subdivision

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28430

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-08-30 14:22:49

CC:  jipilab vdelecroix

Keywords: polyhedron, polytopes, barycentric subdivision, backend

This is a follow up of #27926. `barycentric_subdivision` was forgotten there.

Currently we have

```
sage: polytopes.simplex(backend='field').barycentric_subdivision().backend()
'ppl'
```


The backend should not be changed with this construction, so the desired output in this case is `'field'`.

Is that a positive review JP?

At the moment that I wrote the lines, I was thinking about a potential improvement of the method, but it turns out it is a bit more involved, so I'd say yes, it is a positive review.
