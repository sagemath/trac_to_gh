Applies against 3.0.2.alpha0 and passes tests.  Looks good to me.

Merged 3286.patch in Sage 3.0.3.alpha0. The difference between the two patches seems to be that Mike's patch is a proper mercurial patch while Jason's is a diff. I edited Mike's patch so that Jason gets credit in the log which I assume is the intent here. 

Cheers,

Michael
