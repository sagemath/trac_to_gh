Dirichlet groups use a generic dictionary to cache objects (instead of UniqueRepresentation or UniqueFactory). This ticket replaces this generic cache with a UniqueFactory implementation.

Looks good (although I haven't tested it yet).  Two questions:
- why include `base_ring` in `key`?  It can be recovered as the parent of `zeta`, and isn't used in `create_object()`.
- could you add a doctest to show that it works as intended, i.e. really creates a unique instance?

Nice, I hadn't thought of the fact that two roots of unity can still compare as equal when they are in different fields!  Now testing.
