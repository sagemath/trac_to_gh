# Issue 15504: Deprecate FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis and friends from being in the global namespace

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15741

Thanks to #10963 that introduces axioms and in particular the notation:

```
    Sets().Finite()
```


it will be possible to unclutter the global name space from all the
following::


```
FiniteSets
FiniteEnumeratedSets
InfiniteEnumeratedSets

FinitePosets
FiniteLatticePosets

FiniteSemigroups
FiniteMonoids
FiniteGroups
FinitePermutationGroups

CommutativeAlgebras

MonoidAlgebras
GroupAlgebras

CommutativeRingIdeals
CommutativeAlgebraIdeals

ModulesWithBasis
AlgebrasWithBasis
CoalgebrasWithBasis
BialgebrasWithBasis
HopfAlgebrasWithBasis

FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis
FiniteDimensionalAlgebrasWithBasis
FiniteDimensionalCoalgebrasWithBasis
FiniteDimensionalBialgebrasWithBasis
FiniteDimensionalHopfAlgebrasWithBasis

GradedModules
GradedAlgebras
GradedCoalgebras
GradedBialgebras
GradedHopfAlgebras

GradedModulesWithBasis
GradedAlgebrasWithBasis
GradedCoalgebrasWithBasis
GradedBialgebrasWithBasis
GradedHopfAlgebrasWithBasis

FiniteCoxeterGroups
FiniteWeylGroups
AffineWeylGroups

HighestWeightCrystals
RegularCrystals
FiniteCrystals
ClassicalCrystals
```


The purpose of this ticket is to deprecate them, or at least a good
number of them, from the global name space as a first step toward
removal.

The following might become candidates too, by introducing appropriate
axioms / constructions.

```
RingIdeals
AlgebraModules
AlgebraIdeals

LatticePosets  ???
HopfAlgebras   ???
BiAlgebras
```
