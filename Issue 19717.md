This is a series of ticket about `QQbar` cleaning. In this first one we:
- get rid of `ANRootOfUnity` descriptor
- get rid of special casing for 'zero', 'rootunity', 'imaginary'
- move the 34-gon commented function as a doctest

By doing so we slow down the code for `minpoly` but this will be fixed in subsequent ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19954

The `sage_input` is just intended to reconstruct the object. It is the very same with

```
sage: A = identity_matrix(4)
sage: sage_input(A)
matrix(ZZ, [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
```
the answer is hopefully not `identity_matrix(4)`!

Before this ticket, the algebraic numbers used to remember the way they were constructed. Which is a complete nonsense.

the description at the top of the documentation still refers to

```
Algebraic numbers exist in one of the following forms:

a rational number
the product of a rational number and an nâ€˜th root of unity
etc
```
The second line should be removed, no ?

ok, this seems to be good to go.

One can note that there is the `UniversalCyclotomicField` for people only caring
about the abelian closure of `QQ`.
