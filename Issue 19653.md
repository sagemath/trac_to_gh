Improvement of the standardization computation

- the current one:

```
sage: sage: w = list(Words(100, 100000).random_element())
sage: sage: from sage.combinat.permutation import to_standard
sage: sage: %time sig = to_standard(w)
CPU times: user 4min 42s, sys: 2.65 s, total: 4min 45s
Wall time: 4min 53s
```

- using the merge sort algorithm:

```
sage: sage: w = list(Words(100, 100000).random_element())
sage: sage: from sage.combinat.permutation import to_standard
sage: sage: %time sig = to_standard(w)
CPU times: user 2.33 s, sys: 147 ms, total: 2.47 s
Wall time: 2.5 s
```

That is quite the improvement. Here are some comments and suggestions:

- Why do you import `imap`? You don't seem to use it.
- Are you going to delete the old algorithm or keep it and add an `algorithm` option? I would at least keep the old (naive) algorithm around in a doctest for testing.

}}}
Here is my reasoning:

- I do not think you should have a default for `i` since you almost always call it with an argument. I would just make the one place where you use the default argument (the `for` loop in the main function) explicitly pass `0`.
- The `if not shelves` is faster than calling `len` and comparing to `0`.
- Moving the `n = len(shelves)` call up typically avoids an extra call to `len` and variable allocation is faster than a function call.
- We should use `//` for integer division.
- If we start at 0, we avoid a number of unnecessary `+1`'s and keeps it more in line with standard python code.
- Standard Python formatting should only have `if` (and `else`) statements on one line.
- By not having the `it` variable and the distinct `for` loops, IMO it makes the code more clear as there are less variables to chase around (and it has the same length).

If you agree and make these changes, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Sorry, it is a mistake... I was to fast and I forgot to remove that.

I deleted the old below and I had it in doctest!
