# Issue 26426: clean connectivity.pyx (part 8) - connectivity

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26663

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2018-11-08 16:00:19

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

Here we clean methods related to connectivity: `steiner_tree`, `edge_disjoint_spanning_trees`, `edge_cut`, `vertex_cut`, `multiway_cut`, `max_cut`, `longest_path`, `hamiltonian_path`, `traveling_salesman_problem`, `hamiltonian_cycle`, `feedback_vertex_set`, `flow`, `nowhere_zero_flow`, `_ford_fulkerson`, `multicommodity_flow`, `_build_flow_graph`, `disjoint_routed_paths`, `edge_disjoint_paths`, `vertex_disjoint_paths`, and `dominating_set`.
- PEP8 cleaning
- avoid using `.vertices` and `.edges` whenever possible, or use `.edges(sort=False)` in some cases
- in method `longest_path`, add a `key=...` to a `sorted`
