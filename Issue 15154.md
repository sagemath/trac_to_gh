Hi Maria, The code looks good. A couple of the doc tests failed, though. After you edit the permutation.py file, you can run the doc tests by typing from the command line:
sage -bt permutation.py

(the -b builds sage and the -t runs the doc tests in the file you specify)

This rebuilds sage with your code inserted and runs the doc tests. I fixed the syntax on your doc tests so that they work and pushed the changes to trac.

nice work. If you're fine with my changes, set this to positive_review. Unfortunately, a (trivial, I hope) conflict resolution might become necessary once my #15174 is merged into Sage.

Hi Maria,

I was just looking at it now too. Yes, you should switch to your local branch and pull the changes from the trac server. I believe the commands are:

git fetch origin

pull --ff-only

```

After you pull, you can look at the new code, but if you want to test the features in Sage, you need to build sage:

sage -bt permutation.py

But for me, it's taking a long time to build, probably because it's upgrading to a new beta version. (Is this to be expected, Travis?)

Anyway, once you're happy with it, you can set it to positive review.
