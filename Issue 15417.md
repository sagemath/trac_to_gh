CC:  pbruin

This is weird and bad:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZpFM(3,10))
sage: p = ((x-1)^50 + x)._pari_init_()
sage: %time pari(p).poldisc()
CPU times: user 59.20 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 59.21 s
Wall time: 59.35 s
2*3 + 3^4 + 2*3^6 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)
sage: %time gp(p).poldisc()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.16 s
2*3 + 3^4 + 2*3^6 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 2*3^9 + O(3^10)
```


The problem isn't PARI itself (given the speed of `gp`), it's somehow the PARI interface in Sage.

I'm fine with this change.  I'm not yet familiar with reviewing SPKG changes using the new directory layout.  Why is SPKG.txt deleted in this commit?
