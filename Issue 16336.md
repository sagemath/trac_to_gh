# Issue 16336: Animations saved without visible effect

One can pass an argument called `show_path` to learn about the chosen path, or an argument called `savefile` to specify the name explicitely. But the version without arguments seems rather confusing to me.\n\nTherefore I suggest to change the code, and have it return the name of the generated file. The `Animation.png` method already returns the path of the directory it created, so in a sense this would be consistent. Notebook users would see some feedback indicating what actually happened.

At the moment, the methods `Animation.gif` and `Animation.ffmpeg` will, when called without arguments, create a new temporary file in some temporary directory without telling anyone about it. Apparently, in previous versions the file was created in the current working directory, where the notebook would pick them up. But this is no longer the case.

Therefore I suggest to change the code, and have it return the name of the generated file. The `Animation.png` method already returns the path of the directory it created, so in a sense this would be consistent. Notebook users would see some feedback indicating what actually happened.

Since #16645 the methods will store their files in a location where the notebook will pick them up. So in the embedded case, there is a visible effect. I wonder whether we should cater for the non-notebook case as well. I'm not convinced myself.
