# Issue 27262: some failure on a large link

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27499

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2019-03-15 20:20:55

Trying this in 8.7.b7

```
LS = Link([[6, 10, 1, 7],[8, 18, 7, 19],[11, 6, 12, 5],[17, 12, 18, 13],[4, 16, 5, 17],[15, 11, 16, 14],[14, 4, 13, 3],[20, 2, 19, 1],[2, 9, 3, 8],[9, 20, 10, 15]])
LS.braid()
```

(coming from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3132525/)
gives the error:

```
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    665                             C1 = newPD[newPD.index(heads[a])]
    666                             C1[C1.index(a)] = newedge + 1
--> 667                             C2 = newPD[newPD.index(tails[b])]
    668                             C2[C2.index(b)] = newedge + 2
    669                             newPD.append([newedge + 3, a, b, newedge])

ValueError: [9, 20, 10, 15] is not in list
```

Changing component from geometry to algebraic topology.

Changing keywords from "" to "knot, link".

The PD code used to enter the enter the link is not valid, since it is not compatible with an orientation of the strands. A correct one does work:



```
sage: LS = Link([[6, 10, 1, 7],[7, 19, 8, 18],[11, 6, 12, 5],[17, 12, 18, 13],[4, 16, 5, 17],[15, 11, 16, 14],[13, 3, 14, 4],[19, 1, 20, 2],[2, 9, 3, 8],[9, 20, 10, 15]])
sage: LS.braid()
(s0*s1^-1)^2*s0*(s2*s1^-1)^2*s2
```

ok, thanks. Strange that it works in Snappy though.

Let us close the ticket.

By the way, have you seen my revival of #21863
