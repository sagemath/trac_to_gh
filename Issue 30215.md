It's certainly true that `./sage --startuptime src/sage/homology/simplicial_set.py` raises an error without this branch and doesn't raise an error with it, but with this branch it produces no output. What is it supposed to do?

By the way, it makes me a little uncomfortable to use the same loop variable twice like this:

```
for module_arg in cmdline_args:
    ...
    for module_arg in matching_modules:
        ...
```

On the other hand, `./sage -startuptime src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does produce output. I'm confused.

I would also recommend an explicit `import os` statement. I'm not sure why the script works without it. Edit: I guess it's being imported from `sage.all`, but it would be better to make it explicit at the top.

Without this ticket `./sage --startuptime sage.homology.simplicial_set` gives

```
[]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/src/bin/sage-startuptime.py", line 148, in <module>
    raise ValueError('"' + module_arg + '" does not uniquely determine Sage module.')
ValueError: "sage.homology.simplicial_set" does not uniquely determine Sage module.
```

Before working on this ticket, I had never used these scripts. I don't really know whether the above is expected, or a result of undetected bitrot over the years.

I think that it only works for modules that are loaded when `sage.all` is loaded.

Is it worth printing a message if the file or module is not loaded when `sage.all` is loaded, rather than being completely silent?
