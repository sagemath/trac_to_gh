Keywords: matrix, subdivisions


```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)                                                
sage: A._subdivisions                                                           
sage: A2 = A.change_ring(RDF)                                                     
sage: A2._subdivisions                                                          
( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```

We should also disregard when being passed no subdivisions:

```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)
sage: A._subdivisions
sage: A.subdivide(A.subdivisions())
sage: A._subdivisions
( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```

Oh, now I see that I had not fully understood the problem before, but I agree with the goal of this ticket now. This branch also fixes the problem in #31234, but nevertheless it still seems to be consistent to return a mutable matrix there. Sorry that I rushed it a bit.

Thank you for solving this so quickly. This looks good to me â€“ I just have a very small suggestion:


```diff
-        if row_lines == [] and col_lines == []:
+        if not row_lines and not col_lines:
```
