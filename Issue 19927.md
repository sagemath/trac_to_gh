I only removed the menu from the interface builder, there might be an implementation to remove as well. Though I didn't see anything, its just generic calls to scripts I think.

LGTM.  It's hard to review changes when nibs change, but I didn't see anything obviously wrong when I opened things up in XCode.  :-)

There's no implementation that needs to be removed.
