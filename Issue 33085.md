The slightly unusual output is from #32981.

I set the limit at 30 seconds of cputime on this run so there may be others that should arguably be tagged. (The developer's guide says that even "long time" tests should run in under 5s, but it's referring to "wall time" which is pretty meaningless.)

That was fast =)

Most of those (except maybe the first) do inherently take a long time. But there's another problem: the feature detection takes a long time. So as soon as you mark "the first" imagemagick test `# long time`, some other imagemagick test becomes the first one to get executed. And then that test performs the feature detection, and takes a long time....

So ultimately they all need to be marked `# long time` to avoid the first one taking an unusually long time when `--long` is not used.

You're right, the feature test itself is relatively short. I think I just had bad luck, combined with a few tests that just happen to hover around 30s.

As soon as I applied the patch, two different tests started running long. So I fixed those; then another one. Fixed that, and another one. Then I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

I think this is all of the remaining ones:
