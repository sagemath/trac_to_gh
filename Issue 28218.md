# Issue 28218: 1 doctest failing in src/sage/databases/oeis.py with tag internet

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28455

With sage-8.9.beta9, the command 

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```


gives


```
sage -t --long src/sage/databases/oeis.py

keeping from 0 to 6 would have been enough I think, but let's go with 11.
