So basically you undid my work and then assigned me a ticket to redo it? Ok, thanks.  <== (Sorry, that wasn't meant to be sarcastic; having the ticket is actually helpful).

Since I'm back from vacation now can you just let me fix this for 7.5?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-12-29 10:01:26

I'll take full responsibility for the undoing. I don't know what is Volker timing for 7.5, I must say, but it was on my mind that we couldn't get 7.5 in that state. Blame me if it was put forward.

You may want to make it a blocker if you want to attract Volker's attention.

7.5 isn't released yet so I don't know why it can't wait.

"I don't know what is Volker timing for 7.5"

Yeah neither, it seems, does anybody.  Maybe Sage should have some kind of release schedule...

Here's a workaround that deals with the issue without running code at the setup.py module level.  It's related, somewhat, to #21682, which should now depend on this.

I still see this as something of a stop-gap solution.  My longer-term plan is to implement something that allows Sage's individual sub-packages to provide configuration details on a per-package basis, to be collected by the main setup.py in a consistent manner (similar to, but not exactly the same as http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/building.html#customizing-setup-build-for-subpackages).  This will make it easier for individual packages to inject steps into the build process (sort of like sub-makes) at the appropriate build stages.

Personally, I am really against pushing this to 7.5.

The current 7.5.rc1 is working fine, I would not want to risk to break stuff again. Especially build-system issues might take a while to be discovered.

I also don't see the urgency for this ticket. I agree that something needs to be done, but surely it can wait for Sage 7.6?

To be fair, we only undid your work because it broke stuff.


---

Comment by embray created at 2016-12-30 11:52:07

Yeah, it's fine.  I don't think it's urgent now.

I made some cosmetic changes.

One more thing: is it a problem if some packages appear more than once? Should we do something like

```python
for pkg in autogen_all():
    if pkg not in self.distribution.packages:
        self.distribution.packages.append(pkg)
```

Comment by embray created at 2017-01-02 16:00:02

I thought about that too, and even had that in an earlier version, but concluded that it's not a problem.  If you find some case where it is a problem it could be changed.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-01-03 07:56:38

Given that we both thought about it, you should add a small comment explaining that duplicated entries are potentially a problem but actually aren't a problem.

If this branch actually works (I have not tested it sufficiently yet), this can get positive_review from me.

Comment by embray created at 2017-01-03 09:45:31

Well, you changed the branch to your branch so you're free to do that.  It seems to me like a silly thing to comment on--at that point you might as well put the check in anyways just in case.

OK, let's do that then.

Comment by embray created at 2017-01-03 11:19:25

Will you do it or shall I?  I don't mind, it's just you already switched to your branch.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-01-03 11:56:54

I'm currently doing other things. So if you have time, please go ahead.
