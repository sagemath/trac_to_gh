I find it quite discouraging that no one ever reviewed the 1.58 spkg.  The biopython project is very active, well maintained, and well tested.  It would be nice if these upgrades could be reviewed more quickly.

New spkg is up at:

The new spkg builds and passes tests on several platforms. It's an easy update of an spkg: just drop in a new upstream source. The newest version has a few small cleanups to the spkg structure, as well.
