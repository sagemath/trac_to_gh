I don't think that this `__cmp__` method is used anywhere anyway. It looks to me as though it only checks the base ring, not the rest of the structure, so I think it's broken. Before switching to this branch:

```
sage: A = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a', 'b', 'c'])
sage: B = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['w', 'z'])
sage: A == B # should be false
False
sage: A.__cmp__(B) # should not be zero!
0
sage: A.__cmp__(A)
0
```

I have been told by Travis elsewhere that classes that inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` also inherit from `EqualityById`, with a very fast test of equality, that make the presence of `__cmp__` superfluous.

I agree.
