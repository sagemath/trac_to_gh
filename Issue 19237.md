Keywords: categories, enumerated sets, OOP

See the `map` method in `src/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py`. We want to deprecate combinatorial classes, so let's not use them here.

Might be a good idea to rename/alias this as `direct_image` and make this a functorial construction that works for various other categories.
