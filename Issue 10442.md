I was a bit worried this fixing would change the result of other doctests, but it passed a -testall -long (short of unrelated errors).... Positive review, and thank you for your patch ! `:-)`

I rebased the patch and fixed the first failure, though oddly the changes brought by the second one are already present in apha0... `:-)`

Mike, could you check this new patch ?

This does not happen anymore with a 4.7.rc0 and #10549 applied .... So as it is several months old, can it be closed ? :-)
