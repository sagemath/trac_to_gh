# Issue 28438: Redirect import of GraphicsArray

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28675

Original creator: egourgoulhon

CC:  was kcrisman

Keywords: GraphicsArray

#27865 has refactored the class `GraphicsArray` and has moved its definition from  `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` to `src/sage/plot/multi_graphics.py`. As pointed out in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/eTl4DHcwnOo/uQSOtstWAwAJ, this has broken Sage's API: the import via

```
from sage.plot.graphics import GraphicsArray
```

does not longer work. This ticket makes it work by redirection to the module `sage.plot.multi_graphics`.

The merge conflict solved above was due to the introduction of #27866 in Sage 9.0.beta4.

I like the spirit of this.  Can you actually view this array and do the usual (old) methods with it for now?  (I regret that I cannot actually test this due to time constraints - a sad refrain the past few years.)  Anyway, if so and green patchbot, this is probably the best way to deal with this situation, unless William has other improvements he would suggest.

Yes absolutely, since the object constructed from `sage.plot.graphics.GraphicsArray` is actually a
`sage.plot.multigraphics.GraphicsArray`.

The patchbot is still green...
