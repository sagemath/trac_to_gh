Yes, that solves it for now. I thought, a long term goal is to do as was done for `latte_int`. Or I am mistaken?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.

See #30647 for a new idiom - `lazy_import` with feature - that could replace code like this:

```
        PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
        import PyNormaliz

I do understand what is the goal of this ticket.

Do we want to make `pynormaliz` a standard package?

Or is this this new lazy import idiom better for python package that can also be installed via other sources (e.g. a pip install)?

It seems that `igraph` should be `PyNormaliz`.

Other than this, it looks good to me.
