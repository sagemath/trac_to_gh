You can just write 

```
from sage.features import PythonModule
if PythonModule("PyNormaliz").is_present() ....
```

Yes, that solves it for now. I thought, a long term goal is to do as was done for `latte_int`. Or I am mistaken?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

See #30647 for a new idiom - `lazy_import` with feature - that could replace code like this:

```
        PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
        import PyNormaliz
```

throughout `backend_normaliz.py`.

I do understand what is the goal of this ticket.

Do we want to make `pynormaliz` a standard package?

Or is this this new lazy import idiom better for python package that can also be installed via other sources (e.g. a pip install)?

It seems that `igraph` should be `PyNormaliz`.

Other than this, it looks good to me.

You may remove `PythonModule` from

```
    from sage.features import FeatureNotPresentError, PythonModule     
```
