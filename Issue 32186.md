These updates:
- `numpy` 1.22.0 https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.22.0-notes.html
- `scipy` 1.8.0 
will require us to drop python 3.7 support.

Is the fix for the deprecation warning also OK for early scipy?
Then it's better to put it on a separate ticket that can be merged earlier.

(I think I would want to hold off on the scipy 1.8 upgrade for a little while - maybe it should go into Sage 9.7, not 9.6)
