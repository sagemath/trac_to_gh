implicit_plot3d allows for a region to be specified. No such option exists for implicit_plot. The attached patch provides this option in contour_plot (and therefore in implicit_plot). This is achieved using a feature of matplotlib: masked entries in an array are not plotted.

My attached diff may not be in the recommended form because I am having
difficulty using the sage revision control system. I can try to generate it that way, but I would need some help then.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12813

I added a doctest, but I am not totally sure if sage is actually building it, since my installation seems to be acting up.

I also was wrong about the required form of the region function, but I think the new
documentation should clear that up.
