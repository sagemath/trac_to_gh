# Issue 12641: contour_plot region option

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12813

Original creator: aerusso

Original creation time: 2012-04-05 21:46:12

Assignee: jason, was

implicit_plot3d allows for a region to be specified. No such option exists for implicit_plot. The attached patch provides this option in contour_plot (and therefore in implicit_plot). This is achieved using a feature of matplotlib: masked entries in an array are not plotted.

My attached diff may not be in the recommended form because I am having
difficulty using the sage revision control system. I can try to generate it that way, but I would need some help then.

Great start.  Here are some things to keep in mind with a revision.
 * We want examples in the documentation!  To show off this new functionality :)
 * You seem to have a lot of extra whitespace in the doc part of the patch - maybe unneeded extra line breaks?
 * Does the numpy solution cause any horrible timings?  I assume not, but we wouldn't want using the `region` keyword to slow things down so much that it's not usable.
 * Is there any way to use an `assert` statement to ensure that `region` is in the right form?  Just curious, maybe it's too cumbersome. 
 * You _should_ be able to use [the developer guide instructions](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html) to produce your patch.  Mainly, this is to make sure the patch includes your information (for credit and contact) and has at least a short description of what this patch fixes in the commit message.  Feel free to put any specific instructions that aren't working here.
 * Oh, and put your "real name" in the Author section so that when your contribution is included you are properly acknowledged - this is very important for us to give credit where it's due.

I added a doctest, but I am not totally sure if sage is actually building it, since my installation seems to be acting up.

I also was wrong about the required form of the region function, but I think the new
documentation should clear that up.

Nice!  I rebased the patch to sage 5.0beta12, and removed the trac number from the commit message (it's added in automatically when the patch is merged).  Passes tests, the code looks good, and adds nice functionality!  Thanks!

Make sure to update the Author's field of the ticket with your real name for credit.

I assume only the second patch is needed.

The documentation doesn't build correctly:

```
docstring of sage.plot.contour_plot.contour_plot:257: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
```


Lines 463-465 should be changed to

```
    One can also plot over a reduced region::
```
