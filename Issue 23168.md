LGTM, although it would be nice to have some sort of changelog between these versions.

What is the status of #20393 wrt these upgrades?

Also, there might be some interest in #13426.

Thanks Travis!

I have no idea, and I am indeed totally happy with it being experimental and prefer to keep the freedom. If it becomes optional, then people might use it in doctests and it will be my responsibility to not break anything when upgrading gap3.
