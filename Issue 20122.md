The Sage version of the Sphinx `autodoc` extension and the upstream version have diverged significantly. As a first step to make them converge again, move some changes from upstream Sphinx to Sage.

I don't exactly know what are the included upstream changes but the looking at the diff between the previous and the new doc, the new doc is better at a few specific spot. Moreover we are closer to the upstream file which is definitely better. I'm giving it a positive review.
