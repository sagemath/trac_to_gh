See the discussion at #18238 - there are several options for dealing with things like

```
sage: show(sphere(), heyheyhey=35) # works, should it?
```

* Do checking in `show`
* Do checking in viewers
* Do no checking

Anyway, this ticket is about resolving this issue, which has been around since at least 6.4.1 and probably much longer.

Also, the *handled* options should have their value checked, and not just fail when they are in the process of being drawn on the screen.

The right solution imoh is by introducing infrastructure for "option dictionaries with validation". I made a simple version for the display preferences, for example

```
sage: from sage.repl.rich_output.preferences import DisplayPreferences
sage: d = DisplayPreferences(text='latex')
sage: d
Display preferences:
* graphics is not specified
* text = latex
sage: d.text
'latex'
sage: d.text = 'coocoo'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 d.text = 'coocoo'

/home/vbraun/Code/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/preferences.pyc in setter(self, prefs, value)
    230         if value not in allowed:
    231             raise ValueError('value must be unset (None) or one of {0}, got {1}'
--> 232                              .format(allowed, value))
    233         setattr(prefs, self.underscore_name, value)
    234
