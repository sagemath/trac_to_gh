Keywords: sage-combinat, tableaux, promotion

The doc of the `symmetric_group_action_on_values` method on `Tableau` has a "left" that should be a "right".

While at that, I've documented the helper functions too, since I found myself using them. If I had more time, I'd also expose the `symmetric_group_action_on_values` through the `Word` class.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27068
