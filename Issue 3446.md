Make a forgot password page.

User enters username. The Notebook checks if the user's e-mail has been confirmed.

If the e-mail has been confirmed then a new password is generated in the form of a numeral. That password is e-mailed to the user.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3446
