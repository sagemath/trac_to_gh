# Issue 11309: LLL for degenerate matrices crashes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11481

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2011-06-14 15:40:16

Assignee: jason, was

CC:  novoselt jason spancratz stumpc5 rbeezer

Keywords: sd31

For zero-column matrices, LLL crashes:

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,0,2).LLL()
^C^C^C^C^C
```

Its particularly annoying that keyboard interrupt does not work.

Interesting.  On sage-4.7.1.alpha3, I actually get:

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,0,2).LLL()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

In my previous post, I clearly meant _without_ the patch.

The patch is missing a proper commit message.

Sorry, forgot in the heat of the moment. The updated patch only adds the commit message.

Small remark: for simply changing the commit message, I think there is no need for review.  You can set back positive_review directly.
