Helloooooooooo !!!!

Because of a cyclic reference (the LP pointed toward the LP variables, and the LP variables toward the LP), the LP objects were not immediately deallocated at the end of functions using them. That produced memory problems that have been reported there [1, 2] and there [3].

Thanks to the wonderful people one can find among Sage developpers who always have a perfect answer ready for you, here is a patch to fix it. It's actually quite straightforward (one of the two references was not even necessary, nor even used) when you know where it comes from, but without the good hint you can search for a long time `:-D`

Hi Nathann,

it seems to me that your solution is the cleanest (if a reference is not needed, then avoid it).

A general remark: Python's garbage collector is able to deal with cyclic references. There is only one exception I know of: If one or more of the objects involved in the cycle has a `__del__` method, then Python is not sure where in the cycle the collection should start.

So, if a reference cycle can not be avoided (e.g., a polynomial ring R=ZZ['x','y'] points to its generators R.0, R.1, but the generators are elements and thus point to their parent R), then one could also solve the problem by not introducing `__del__` methods.

`__dealloc__` (in Cython) is fine, though; but it would only be called *after* all Python attributes of the object are gone.

Concerning your patch: Any bug fix ought to be doc tested.

So, could you add a test that demonstrates that the leak is fixed? This could be along the following lines:

```
sage: C = the.class.of.the.object.that.was.leaking
sage: import gc
sage: _ = gc.collect()  # avoid side effects of other doc tests
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,C)])
0
sage: <some code that would create leaking C instances without your patch>
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,C)])
0
```

Of course, it should then also be checked that the last line does not return 0 without your patch.

Hi Nathann,

is it really safe to do

```
sage: just_create_variables() 
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,C)]) 
```

without a garbage collection between the two lines?

Of course, the variables created inside `just_create_variables` are deleted when it is done. However, there is no guarantee that a deleted object is immediately garbage collected. In general, garbage collection can happen between any two Python calls -- sooner or later.

Hence, it could be that the doc test example runs into a racing condition, and it could happen that the test randomly fails when Python decides that it is not in the mood for an immediate garbage collection. I suggest to insert

```
sage: _ = gc.collect()
```

between the two lines, just to be on the safe side.

Replying to [comment:7 ncohen]:

Then there is either no memory leak, or the leaking object is not `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`. 

> Using gc.collect() was actually Volker's first answer to the sage-devel thread which totally solved the problem : the instances of MixedIntegerLinearProgram are indeed deallocated by the garbage collector when it is *called*, which is not done systematically when the function ends.

That's just the usual behaviour of garbage collection.

Hm. Difficult.

When you say "memory leak", I expect something like

```
sage: for p in prime_range(10^5):
....:     K = GF(p)
....:     a = K(0)
....:     
```

Here, the line `a = K(0)` creates a coercion from `ZZ` to `K`, and without #715 and #11521 coercion maps *together with domain and codomain* are cached and will thus stay in memory forever, soon eating up your computer's brain.

But when you say that the garbage collector can successfully collect the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` when explicitly do the collection, then it should be the case that sooner or later it will be collected automatically.

In fact, it is the case:

```
sage: def just_create_variables():
....:     for n in range(1000):
....:         p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram() 
....:         b = p.new_variable() 
....:         p.add_constraint(b[3]+b[6] <= n)
....:         p.solve() 
....:         print n,get_memory_usage()
....:         
sage: just_create_variables()
0 842.51171875
1 842.671875
2 842.671875
3 842.671875
4 842.671875
5 842.8359375
6 842.8359375
...
993 846.75
994 846.75
995 846.75
996 846.75
997 846.75
998 846.75
999 846.75
```


OK, the memory consumption mildly increases, but the instances of the mixed integer linear program are collectable:

```
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,MixedIntegerLinearProgram)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/SimonKing/<ipython console> in <module>()

NameError: name 'gc' is not defined
sage: import gc # Oops...
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,MixedIntegerLinearProgram)])
8  # only 8, even though 1000 were created!!
sage: gc.collect()
100
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,MixedIntegerLinearProgram)])
0
```


That is with vanilla sage-4.8 on sage.math. So, I'd say there was no leak!

In the ticket description, you mention a few reports on memory leaks. Is the objective of this ticket to fix all of them?

If this ticket fixes at least one of them, then it can be turned into a doc test (by the same blahblah with `gc.get_objects()` as before).

For instance, does your patch fix the following memory leak (sorry, can't test it myself right now)?

```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
for count in [1..100000]:
    if count % 5000 == 0:
        print count
        print get_memory_usage()
        gc.collect()
        print get_memory_usage()
    test = g.independent_set()

```

Here, you are just calling `g.independent_set()` repeatedly - but apparently some objects won't be garbage collected. That would really be a memory leak.

Well, the objective of this ticket was to fix this memory leak as *when I created the ticket* I believed the memory leak came from non-deallocated MixedIntegerLinearProgram objects.

The memory leak that is given in the report actually has two causes : 
* the problem this very patch adresses 
* a memory leak in the interface with Cliquer that is being fixed in #12622. By the way, I wrote to Jason about that and it looks like the patch will actually be a total rewriting of Cliquer's interface with Sage.

Hi Nathann,

Replying to [comment:12 ncohen]:
> > In the ticket description, you mention a few reports on memory leaks. Is the objective of this ticket to fix all of them?

I think I stand corrected in what I said about Python's garbage collector.

If I am not mistaken, the garbage collector is involved *only* if there are reference cycles. Hence, if an object deleted and is not contained in a reference cycle, it will be immediately removed, even if garbage collection is switched off:

```
sage: class C:
....:     def __del__(self):
....:         print "deleting the object"
....:         
sage: class D:
....:     pass
....: 
sage: c = C()
sage: import gc
sage: gc.disable()
sage: del c
deleting the object
```


Hence, since your patch destroys one reference cycle, it makes sure that a deleted mixed integer linear program will be immediately removed.

Here is an example in which garbage collection comes in. The slight problem is that if one has a `__del__` method in the cycle, then the garbage collector does not know what to do. Hence, in my example, I am creating a cycle of instances of D, with a pointer to an instance of C, such that one sees when things are deleted:

```
sage: d1 = D()
sage: d2 = D()
sage: d1.d = d2
sage: d2.d = d1
sage: c = C()
sage: d1.c = c
sage: del d1
sage: del c
sage: del d2
```

Nothing happens! The `__del__` method of c is not called!! Hence, with garbage collection disabled, the reference cycle `d1 <--> d2` can not be removed.

Let's do the collection manually:

```
sage: gc.collect()
deleting the object
681
```

Aha! The reference cycle, and thus the last reference to c, has gone.

The last example shows that we must not have `__del__` in the reference cycle:

```
sage: d = D()
sage: c = C()
sage: d.c = c
sage: c.d = d
sage: del c
sage: del d
sage: gc.collect()
4
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,C)])
1
```

So, c is not deleted and will not be deleted! That would be a memory leak.

What does that mean for your patch?

- I still believe it is a good idea to avoid reference cycles, when possible. However, I don't think that your patch fixes an actual leak.
- By now, I think that your example *does* demonstrate the fix, and that it works stably.

So, let me run doctests, and if they pass, I give it a positive review.

Sorry, but the patch does not apply to sage-5.0.prealpha0, and that's the latest version that I have on my laptop. The three mismatches happen in sage/numerical/mip.pyx.

Actually, that was the first thing I thought when I read your patch: It not only changes code but also changes a lot of white space - which makes it very likely that mismatches happen, and they did happen.

For example, your patch tries to replace a line formed by 8 white spaces with an empty line (namely in line 214 of mip.pyx). These 8 white spaces are not present in sage-5.0.prealpha0. 

However, the patch does apply to sage-5.0.beta6, and I found that the white space has been introduced in #11606.

So, I am adding it as a dependency.
