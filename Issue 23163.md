It sounds like you have two branches that have the "equivalent" commits but are based off two different branches. So they are not the *same* commits and git then has to deal with these conflicts.

No, this is not what my problem came from. And I did cherry-pick. See example below.

> Don't forget to also do `git merge --abort` when you want to stop doing a merge, 

I did.

Just for testing git, I created the following toy example:
- git init in some folder.
- create `my_file`, that contains the alphabet, one lower-case letter in each line. Add that file and commit. That's the starting point.
- create two branches A and B.
- In branch A, change the letter j in my_file to J (upper-case) and commit. Let's call this "commit xyz".
- In branch B, change all vowels to upper-case letters, and commit.

Now I am on branch B, and I want to apply the changeset from xyz. This could be tried by either "git merge A" or by "git cherry-pick xyz"; it turns out that the resulting problem is the same.

Of course the changeset from xyz cannot be applied, as the changeset's context contains one line with the lower-case letter i, but is being applied to a file where there is an upper-case letter I. So, of course, there is a conflict.

Therefore, after "git merge" resp. "git cherry-pick", we do "git mergetool". Result: meld opens with three versions of my_file. The left column is from branch B (vowels are upper-case, j is lower case). The middle column, which will eventually contain the result of the merge, is the common ancestor of A and B (*all* letters are lower-case). The right column is from branch A (only J is upper-case, the rest is lower-case).

Consequently, in order to merge, I need to *manually* change all vowels in the middle column to upper-case, and also change j to upper-case. In other words, I need to manually apply all changes.

And I really wonder why git makes me do 6 changes (5 vowels plus j), when 4 of these changes (namely the vowels a,e,o,u) are outside of the changeset.

To me, it seems obvious that in the middle column we should start with B (perhaps even after applying the hunks from the changeset that cleanly apply), because that's what we want to apply the changeset to. And then, we can solve the problem by focusing on the changeset: Change i into I and j into J. Done.

So, what is git's rationale for not doing the obvious? How to do better?

because I have this in my .gitconfig:

Argh.

After kdiff3's successful automatic merge, I did "git commit". To be on the safe side, I wanted to repeat the test. So, I did "git reset --hard HEAD~".

Then, the following happened when retrying:

```
$ git merge A
Auto-merging my_file
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in my_file
Resolved 'my_file' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

These are conflicting messages: It says the it resolved the problem using previous resolution, but also stated that the automatic merge failed.

Therefore, I had a look at my_file, which looked fine: The conflict was correctly resolved. However, "git log" showed that the commit from A has in fact not been merged.

Therefore, I tried "git commit". Result:

```
$ git commit 
U	my_file
error: commit is not possible because you have unmerged files.
hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.
fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
```


Since there seem to be unresolved conflicts, I did

```
$ git mergetool 
No files need merging
```

WTF? There are unresolved conflicts, thus, I cannot commit, but no files need merging? Let's see the status:

```
On branch B
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   my_file

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	my_file.orig
```

Hm. Very very strange (to me, at least). Can you explain what is happening here?

I don't use it for my workflow, but I would say it depends on what works best for you.

I don't know the policy about dependencies. #23411 is a dependency of #21437 and merges cleanly into #21437; however, the branch from #21437 doesn't contain all of #23411. Should it?
