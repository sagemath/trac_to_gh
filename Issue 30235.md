# Issue 30235: Change remaining all-caps SAGE to Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30472

Original creator: slelievre

Keywords: beginner, typo

Originally Sage was called SAGE (in all-caps).

Many code comments, docstrings or error messages
still have the all-caps version.

This ticket is to fix that.

To locate all-caps `SAGE` not preceded or followed
by underscore, change to the Sage root folder and run:


```bash
$ git grep '\([^_]\|^\)SAGE\([^_]\|$\)' src
```


This leaves alone environment variables
such as `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_SRC` etc.

Can someone suggest a better regular expression to

- also avoid `MESSAGE`, `USAGE`, `SAGEDIR`, `$SAGE`
- not capture adjacent characters

```
git grep -w SAGE src/sage
```

(words only)

We may want to add these patterns to those in #30467... so that also future code is checked against them and these bad patterns do not creep back in.

Use `\b` for word boundaries

In `src/sage/schemes/plane_conics/all.py` and elsewhere, while we are at it:


```diff
-#   Sage: System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation
+#   Sage: Open Source Mathematical Software
```


In `src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx` maybe un-all-caps this comment:


```diff
-        # REMNANT OF THE OLD CODE THAT WAS NOT YET TRANSLATED
-        # TO Sage'S GRAPH ISOMORPHISM. POTENTIAL SPEEDUP?
+        # Remnant of the old code that was not yet translated
+        # to Sage's graph isomorphism. Potential speedup?
```


In `src/sage/symbolic/todo.txt`, properly capitalize other software names too?


```diff
-* Maybe change Sage's Ginac to make a call to a cython gcd function, then use
-singular, since singular's gcd over QQ is much better than ginac's, I think,
-and ginac *only* does GCD over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in normal.cpp
-be implemented via Singular, probably...
+* Maybe change Sage's GiNaC to make a call to a Cython gcd function, then use
+  Singular, since Singular's gcd over QQ is much better than GiNaC's, I think,
+  and GiNaC *only* does gcd over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in
+  normal.cpp be implemented via Singular, probably...
```


That todo file should really go, see #30482.

Thanks!

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Changing priority from minor to critical.


---

Comment by slelievre created at 2020-10-11 16:38:10

Marking critical since it's been so long this name change happened.

I really want this to be in Sage 9.2 so we turn that page.
