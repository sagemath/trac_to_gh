CC:  @fchapoton @slel

Keywords: beginner, typo

Originally Sage was called SAGE (in all-caps).

Many code comments, docstrings or error messages
still have the all-caps version.

This ticket is to fix that.

To locate all-caps `SAGE` not preceded or followed
by underscore, change to the Sage root folder and run:


```bash
$ git grep '\([^_]\|^\)SAGE\([^_]\|$\)' src
```


This leaves alone environment variables
such as `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_SRC` etc.

Can someone suggest a better regular expression to

- also avoid `MESSAGE`, `USAGE`, `SAGEDIR`, `$SAGE`
- not capture adjacent characters

We may want to add these patterns to those in #30467... so that also future code is checked against them and these bad patterns do not creep back in.

In `src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx` maybe un-all-caps this comment:
