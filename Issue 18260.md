The given branch misses some dependencies (babel, snowballstemmer). Installing them via pip makes Sphinx build. But documentation failed to build.

Any ideas how to fix

```


without changing

```
.. automethod:: _super_categories
```

to

```
.. automethod:: Category._super_categories
```

because there are a lot of these warnings.

While building sphinx I get:

```

wget works just fine in downloading `snowballstemmer` from `pypi.python.org/simple/snowballstemmer`

Comment by strogdon created at 2015-09-08 04:26:58

The inability to download `snowballstemmer>=1.1` seems to be because of

```
export http_proxy=http://192.0.2.0:5187/
```

in `build/bin/sage-spkg`. This was supposedly fixed in #14243. Am I the only one getting this?

I don't see how #14243 is related. The proxy is obviously intentional, read the comment.

You're right about #14243 not being related. I was a bit hasty. And I realize the proxy is intentional. But what's the work-around here to allow Sphinx to install correctly? If I'm not mistaken, the proxy is blocking `snowballstemmer` download. But maybe there is something else.

Add a `snowballstemmer` package.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2015-11-17 00:23:34

This works for me, but not perfectly. In addition to the changes here, I used `sage --pip install` to install `snowballstemmer` and `alabaster`. I also had to change `exclude_trees` to `exclude_patterns` wherever it occurred in doc/common: `exclude_trees` was deprecated before and has now been removed. (This was in `src/doc/common/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf.py`, `src/doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`.)

I ran into the issue mentioned in comment:3, so I made those references more explicit (changed `_blah` to `Category._blah`, etc.). Then the file `sage/lfunctions/zero_sums.pyx` was giving me errors I didn't understand, for example

```
OSError: [lfunction] docstring of sage.lfunctions.zero_sums.LFunctionZeroSum_EllipticCurve:0: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "class".
```

So I removed it from the reference manual. I'll keep looking at that file, though.

Then in the second pass through the reference manual, the build stopped with complaints about missing references or citations. Maybe Sphinx is pickier now, and wants the reference before any citations to it, so I moved some of them to the top-level docstring in the file, and that helped. There is a few cross-file references, and I don't know what to do about that one except to run Sphinx again and hope it resolves the reference. The build completed this way.

By the way, Sphinx 1.3.2 (a bug-fix release) is supposed to be released in a few days.

Comment by strogdon created at 2015-11-17 00:57:27

I have tried the same (I missed the `exclude_trees` deprecation) and I too see in the build log

```

```

And I have been searching high and low to figure out the issue. Also, if `alabaster` is not needed then `sphinx` will have to be patched to prevent it from being imported. Something like:

```

I have created a branch for testing purposes which does this and the other changes I outlined above. It is not at all ready for review. Issues:

- removing this "parallel" decorator is probably not a good idea.
- `snowballstemmer` needs be added as a new package.
- Maybe `alabaster`, too? I don't see why not.
- The issue with missing references needs to be resolved.

When I first started making changes to deal with the issue mentioned in comment:#3 I only had to make changes to these files

```
sage/categories/category.py
sage/categories/category_with_axiom.py
sage/sets/cartesian_product.py
sage/combinat/permutation.py
```

I thought this odd and suspected that something else was the reason requiring the changes.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2015-11-17 06:45:40

I wouldn't be surprised if something else was causing those problems. I didn't do a careful case-by-case test to see which changes were necessary.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-11-17 08:27:14

The huge change to `sage_autodoc.py` really scares me a lot. I already have several tickets concerning the docbuilding sitting in needs_review and this ticket here will almost certainly cause a lot of conflicts.

I would much prefer to stick with the current version of Sphinx (unless you have a good reason to upgrade) and first clean up the Sphinx mess.

If this ever gets up steam again it appears that the `inline-latex.patch` may no longer be needed. The following

https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1480
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2188

are supposedly addressed in 1.3.5 (actually fixed in 1.3.4).

Also, sphinx still tries to load `alabaster` even though it is not installed because of `no_alabaster.patch`. In `Sphinx-1.4/sphinx/application.py` there is


```
        # for now, sphinx always load a 'alabaster' extension.
        if 'alabaster' not in self.config.extensions:

So, using `MAKE=make -j1` the first failures/warnings are:

```

```

And all occur where there is

```
    .. automethod:: __call__
```

which is the same type of error we had way back when. So what's the `fix` - to include the `class` name with the `method` name?

The html-docs do build once I deal with `alabaster`.

```
[tensor_fr] Extension error:
[polynomia] Extension error:
[repl     ] Extension error:
[tensor_fr] Could not import extension alabaster (exception: No module named alabaster)
```


It seems to me that that either `alabaster` must be included as a package or it must be neutered (see comment:42). Also there is a typo in `/build/pkgs/sphinx/patches/Makefile.patch`, `epdflatex` should be `pdflatex` which halts building of the latex-docs.


---

Comment by strogdon created at 2016-04-22 19:12:30

I might add that I find it amazing how this has progressed. Initially it was a nightmare.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-04-22 20:20:42

The generated documentation doesn't look bad either, there is not much difference with the old version. One thing I noticed is that the `sage:` prompts are no longer syntax highlighted in a special way. This is probably a bug, in any case it makes the documentation look more boring.

Perhaps getting a bit ahead but if I force building the pdf-docs I get


```
                $
l.6285 \($\prod
               _j=1^{i-1} m_j^{-1} (mod m_i)$\)
```

which seems to come from

```
local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/rings_standard/rings_standard.tex
```


The associated math formulas in

```
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/rings_standard/sage/ext/multi_modular.html
```

don't look correct.

WikiFormatting is not working properly for me here. I can't get what I want inside a ``...``

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2016-04-24 00:56:49

Is this the formula on line 710 of `multi_modular.pyx`? That looks like it has extra backticks or dollar signs: the formula should have one or the other, not both.

I fixed this problem by simply installing `alabaster`. It's a small package, so it's not worth the trouble to patch Sphinx for it. Also, while Sage doesn't use alabaster, maybe other packages do use it.

Yes, that's it. And there is a similar problem in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` around line 8830.

```
 There are two square roots of `$(x + 1)^2$`
```

It appears this version of Sphinx is exposing some sphinx syntax issues in the documentation that now appear when generating the latex files for building the pdf-docs. The older sphinx -> latex must be a bit more forgiving.

Feel free to add commits to fix such issues. I will stop rebasing this branch to make it easier for other people to push fixes.

Sage now builds and all doctests pass with this branch. On first sight, the documentation looks good too.

Also, I see two of


```
! LaTeX Error: Lonely \item--perhaps a missing list environment.
```


in `docpdf.log`. After grepping through `latex/en/reference` it's because of `combinat/combinat.tex` and `graphs/graphs.tex` where there is


```
}, \footnote[2]{\sphinxAtStartFootnote%\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item {}
Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.

\end{enumerate}
```


I suspect this should be


```
}, \footnote[2]{\sphinxAtStartFootnote%
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item {}
Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.

\end{enumerate}
```


which does work. And since this is auto-generated, I suspect a bug?

Replying to [comment:72 strogdon]:
> And since this is auto-generated, I suspect a bug?

The real problem is that docutils interprets this as a list item (and that's a feature!):

```
E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```

This should work:

```diff
-.. [2] E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
+.. [2] \E. Assmus, J. Key, Designs and their codes, CUP, 1992.
```

Is this ready for review?

So I've finally been able to build the pdf-docs without error.

Let's say it's ready for review then.

This looks good. Everything builds here. I do see

```
Makefile:27: recipe for target 'all-pdf-ja' failed
make[2]: [all-pdf-ja] Error 255 (ignored)
for f in *.tex; do platex -kanji=utf8  $f; done
```

when building the Japanese pdfs (the two Japanese pdfs are generated and, as far as I can determine, look OK). Perhaps a consequence of my system Japanese lang installation which took some effort to get it to work.

`@`jhpalmieri (John) add your name if you concur.

I never managed to get the Japanese docs working, so I cannot fully test that either.
