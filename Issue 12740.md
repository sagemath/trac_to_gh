Investing further,
bruhat_interval explicitly destructs the C++ list which is defined
earlier in this method and passed to Coxeter3's `interval` function.  Is
it really needed? If we comment it out, there is no more segfault.  So
the destruction must somehow corrupt Coxeter3's internal state (though
it's strange that the segfault occurs upon constructing a new group)

Some evidence why it might not be needed:

- It's a list, not a reference to a list; so c++ should destruct it at
  the end of the function, right?

- Assignment/copy operators seem to be appropriately defined in
  Coxeter3 for CoxWord element to be put in a list and be destructed
  properly.

- The pointcare_polynomial does very similar things but does not call
  this destructor at the end (so at least one of the two is wrong).

- There does not seem to be a memory leak when one comments out the
  destructor, at least not after the third call:

  {{{
    sage: sage: from sage.libs.coxeter.coxeter import CoxGroup as CoxGroup
    sage: W = CoxGroup(['A',7])
    sage: w0 = WeylGroup(['A',7]).long_element().reduced_word()
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    sage: 911.23046875
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5972.0
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
  }}}

  This is confirmed by looking at the processus memory usage.

Altogether, I guess I vote for commenting out the questionable
destructor call, and consider the issue as resolved for now. We will
see later if any issue arises once we put Coxeter 3 to heavy use.

Mike, what do you think?

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

If we remove the -soname option then it is broke on Anne's machine.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug

The implementation of the parabolic KL polynomials is changed so that it works with infinite Coxeter groups.

I've just reupped an spkg, at:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/coxeter3-1.1.spkg
then.
It now works on cygwin.
The test I used was over quoted...
And it needs $(CXX) to link on Cygwin, not sure why it works elsewher, surely because undefined symbols are allowed.
