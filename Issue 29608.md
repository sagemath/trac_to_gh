# Issue 29608: PEP 517 buildapi for sage_setup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29845

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-06-11 02:25:50

Instead of fixing `setup.py sdist` using `MANIFEST.in` (#21516), we implement a PEP 517 `buildapi` in `sage_setup`. 

This could be done, for example, by customizing flit.
