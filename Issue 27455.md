To get the same repr for a class (without "at ...") in both Py2 and Py3, it may be as simple as defining the classes with `class A(object):`. It looks like the difference in printing is between old-style and new-style classes, and python3 has only new style classes. So, including the `(object)` brings the example in Py2 closer to what it does in Py3.

The problem with "name" might need more work.

At some point I definitely fixed or changed something related to this but I'm wracking my brain to remember where.

IIRC one of the main issues here is that I (?) fixed pickling of nested classes such that `NestedClassMetaclass` is all but unnecessary.  But I might have dreamed it; it's all a bit foggy.

Here it is--it turns out that the issue this is trying to work around just isn't relevant on Python 3, so it makes `NestedClassMetaclass` a no-op to be removed whenever we drop Python 2 support.

There does appear to be a legitimate issue here w.r.t. Sphinx.

In the class `QuasiSymmetricFunctions` the nested class `Fundamental` also has an alias of just `F`.  That is, in the class body it has:


```
F = Fundamental
```


just as a shortcut.  This does not affect the qualified name of the class, which is still correct:


```
sage: QuasiSymmetricFunctions.Fundamental.__qualname__
'QuasiSymmetricFunctions.Fundamental'
```


but for some reason Sphinx is outputting the docs for `QuasiSymmetricFunctions` with this nested class listed as just "F" instead of "Fundamental", whereas in the [current docs](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/ncsf_qsym/qsym.html#sage.combinat.ncsf_qsym.qsym.QuasiSymmetricFunctions.Fundamental) it's listed correctly as "Fundamental".

I think so.  I (or someone) needs to work out exactly what's going on, IIRC in sage_autodoc, such that aliases for some nested classes are being preferred over the class itself.

I think it might just be some dict sorting issue, but it needs to actually explicitly detect cases where an object's attribute name is not the same as its `__name__`.

That is, when looping over the members of, for example, `QuasiSymmetricFunctions`, you'll find a `Fundamental` member and an `F` member which both point to the same object, the class named `Fundamental`.  The docbuild is failing because this member is being listed as just "class F" and not "class Fundamental".
