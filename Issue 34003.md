# Issue 34003: With dot2tex installed, doctesting thematic_tutorials/algebraic_combinatorics/rsk.rst opens an image viewer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34240

At least on OS X, if `dot2tex` is installed, then doctesting the file `thematic_tutorials/algebraic_combinatorics/rsk.rst` opens up the Preview app to display an image, because of line 23:

```
    sage: view(H)  # optional - dot2tex graphviz
```
