Keywords: HyperplaneArrangements,days100

This ticket implements the following changes to the class `HyperplaneArrangementElement`:

* In the method `is_central`, add the argument `certificate=False`. If set to `True`, this will additionally return the center of the arrangement. The center is easily obtainable as a byproduct of the existing calculation. 
* Add the method `center()`. This will return the center of the arrangement as computed by `is_central(certificate=True)`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28245

Here are few schönheitssachen:

- space after comma in the definition (pep8 conventions...)

- swap `(default: False)` and `boolean` in the docstring

- I would use the verb return instead of include

- `is_central` needs the appropriate doctests checking all possibilities.

- `center` needs an example when the hyperplane arrangement is not central.

I would suggest to use the Polyhedra parents and then return `.universe()` and `.empty()` which are less costly to execute in principle.

No need of a bullet list for one element:

```diff
-        If ``certificate`` is False:
-
-        - A boolean
+        If ``certificate`` is ``False``, returns a boolean
```

- Missing empty lines before the doctests (in both functions).

I noted another small thing:

```
+        If ``certificate`` is True, returns a tuple containing:
+
+        1. A boolean
+        2. The polyhedron defined to be the intersection of all the hyperplanes
+
+        If ``certificate`` is False, returns a boolean.
```

True and False should be between two back ticks... Otherwise, looks good. Just waiting that bots go over it again...

Thanks, I was not careful enough with these conventions.

Thank you for sharing these thoughts. If both methods had been new, I probably would have done the `right_kernel` calculation and just decided to return it or not depending on the `certificate` switch. But as `is_central` was already implemented, I considered not slowing down the existing method more important than obtaining a faster computation of the new method `center`. Is this a good approach to deciding such issues?

It sounds reasonable, yes. Though I actually like Travis's idea of not having to recompute the function, however it was called first. Is it hard to switch to this?

As Travis wrote, there are two lines to be inserted and some lines to be deleted, that would be all. If you think the additional computation time for the `right_kernel` and the construction of the `Polyhedron` aren't slowing down `is_central` too much, I could do it.

I would say it is fine yes. 

Unless you find an example where you have tons of hyperplanes (10 000+) I don't think it will take too much time. Just for the record, if speed is really important, you could benchmark the before and after for some relatively big example just to have an idea...
