# Issue 24093: Implement degeneracy maps for GammaH

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24330

Original creator: mderickx

Original creation time: 2017-12-06 17:43:21

Right now one has for example

```
sage: G = GammaH(5*7^2,[197,106])
sage: M = ModularSymbols(G,sign=0)
sage: C = M.cuspidal_subspace()
sage: C.old_subspace()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
```

And this is because the degeneracy maps for GammaH are not implemented yet.

Could this be a duplicate of #21798?
