A ringed tree of level `k` is a fully binary tree with k levels (counting the root as a level) in which all vertices at the same level are connected by a ring. Such graphs have been used for instance in [http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1717](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1717).

Hellooooooooo David !!

Here is a ... reviewer's patch `:-D`

You created a file containing a method "RingedTree", but you called it "families.py"... If we move all the stuff from graph_generators to families.py and other files, would you see a problem with putting Robert Miller's copyright from graph_generators.py at the head of families.py (and we will do the same at the head of the new files we will create) ? Otherwise it would be a bit like stealing the copyright just by moving the code around `^^;`

If you agree with the patch you can set the ticket to "positive review". And we will handle all that stuff when we will move the code around !

You have fully rewritten the function in a much smarter way. Thanks!
I was not aware of the circle embedding function. Nice.

You are perfectly right. We could may be already put his name and remove mine.

Well.. This one is reviewed already, so let's settle this with a big nasty patch that will totally destroy the graph_generators file `:-D`

Yeah !

It's perfect as it is `:-)`

By the way, I'm living in a shared flat right now, for something like a month or so. This way I can see what life is like in Paris, including the loooooong commuting toward Orsay. Well, I'll be looking for a new flat in a couple of weeks and the rents here are really expensive (750~800 for a "studio"), but the city is real nice.... `;-)`
