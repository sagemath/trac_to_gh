The Cplex Backend (cplex_backend.pxd) allows CPLEX to invoke the [ maximum number of threads on the system. This might be quite difficulty on a cluster, e.g. condor managed system.]

Already found the parameter its:

int CPX_PARAM_THREADS = 1067

PXsetintparam(....,CPX_PARAM_THREADS, #Params);

We could add a parameter to MixedIntegerLinearProgram(..., solver_parameter=Params(#Threads...)...)?

This could be made *much* easier with #10785, which has been waiting for a review for 9 months now `:-p`

We can close this one, because [#10785](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10785) does it even better.

To catch the release manager's attention, you need to set it to positive review, IIRC.

That's totally wrong, I'm told one needs to sing and dance around a fire until the Release Manager comes `:-)`

*and* put the milestone to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix please, so I know there is nothing to be done besides closing this ticket.
