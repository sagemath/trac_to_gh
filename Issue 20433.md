# Issue 20433: let the user define their own polynomial for Fq in givaro

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20670

Givaro does not allow Fq to be defined with a user-supplied polynomial. This patch, taken from Macaulay2, allows to do this; in particular, this would allow Macaulay2 building using Sage-supplied givaro.

Why do you think that?

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: k
Finite Field in a of size 3^2
sage: k.modulus()
x^2 + 1
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>
```

Do you know how to do this on C++ level?

At least, that's what Macaulay2 people came up with, that patch in the ticket branch.
Perhaps they should have done this differently?

In `givgfq.h`, there is

```
template<typename Vector>
GFqDom(const UTT P, const UTT e, const Vector& modPoly);
```

right above the line added by Macaulay2.

Note the subtle difference: it does not take a `generatorPoly` argument in case that matters.

well, yes, indeed, in Macaulay2 one can specify a primitive element along with a modulus. So with this patch Sage can do the same (although I don't see how to override `k.multiplicative_generator()`; I thought I can just specify `self.__multiplicative_generator` in `FiniteField_givaro`, but it does not work...)

It seems that `FiniteField_givaro` isn't even used, and the whole class structure is a mystery to me here.

Are you sure that Macaulay2 really requires a custom primitive element and a custom polynomial or is that just an implementation detail?

Given a modulus (or not), it can certainly compute a primitive element, although it does have an [option to supply a custom primitive element](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.7/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/___Primitive__Element.html). And to do this it uses givaro backend with the patch in question.

This is one of the two patches (another one is for ffpack) needed to build and run Macaulay2 v1.9 (the current version, with an adaptation of Sage's pari/mpir workaround --- after I told them about Sage's pari/mpir workaround related to memory allocators) within Sage.

The patch should have some sort of documentation (ideally in the patch header)

my hope is to implement a possibility to supply a primitive element to `GF()`, using this patch as a backend. But I got lost trying to figure out how the current implementation uses givaro.

Could anyone point me to the right place in the code?

I am told that the patch on the branch is in givaro 4.0.2.

Indeed, the patch has been merged upstream in [https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/pull/18](https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/pull/18) and released in 4.0.2 that is now in #17635.

I have to re-open this, but is it possible without opening a new ticket?


---

Comment by embray created at 2017-01-19 17:38:35

Yes, (under action).  I think you have the permissions to do that but I'm not sure.  I've been yelled at before for doing this but in this case I was the one who closed the ticket so I don't mind reopening it too if you think it should be.

Ping - I have been recently asked how to define a custom primitive element (Magma can do it, so they have to use Magma because of this, and better support for Zech transform)
