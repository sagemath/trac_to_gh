Givaro does not allow Fq to be defined with a user-supplied polynomial. This patch, taken from Macaulay2, allows to do this; in particular, this would allow Macaulay2 building using Sage-supplied givaro.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20670

Why do you think that?

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: k
Finite Field in a of size 3^2
sage: k.modulus()
x^2 + 1
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>

right above the line added by Macaulay2.

Note the subtle difference: it does not take a `generatorPoly` argument in case that matters.

Given a modulus (or not), it can certainly compute a primitive element, although it does have an [option to supply a custom primitive element](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.7/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/___Primitive__Element.html).

my hope is to implement a possibility to supply a primitive element to `GF()`, using this patch as a backend. But I got lost trying to figure out how the current implementation uses givaro.
