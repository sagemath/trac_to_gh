# Issue 6417: Unicode in LaTeX

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/6417

Original creator: mora

Original creation time: 2009-06-25 21:53:59

Assignee: cwitty

Keywords: unicode LaTeX

In a %latex cell I couldn't use any accentuated letter. I had to write \"o to get รถ.

Using this patch I can write unicode characters directly. For example Hungarian chars:

This feature is important because most of the world uses more than the first 128 characters of ANSII.

Looks good to me except that it doesn't pass doctests.  Apply the patch at #6434 and you're good to go.

So this patch depends on #6434; modulo that, positive review.

`sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/misc/latex.py"` fails after applying this patch.

As my comment says, doctests don't pass until you apply the patch at #6434.  Once #6434 gets in, this one is ready to go.  Is there some way to label this besides "positive review" to indicate this?

My bad, wasn't paying enough attention.

See #6464 for a related issue. It concerns Unicode in Notebook worksheets.
