# Issue 20171: BinaryQF solve_integer can crash

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20408

Original creator: Eric119

Original creation time: 2016-04-09 22:38:34

This was observed on SageMathCloud cloud.sagemath.com, on April 9, 2016. The solve_integer method of BinaryQF crashes in some cases. For instance,


```
BinaryQF([1, 0, 4]).solve_integer(10)
```


produces the error report


```
Error in lines 1-1

Can close as invalid, because this no longer gives an error.
