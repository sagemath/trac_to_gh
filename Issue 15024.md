CC:  uri @vbraun

See #14962.  We have to either fix the newest version checking in brian or (better) get rid of it completely.

This would be an ideal time to upgrade brian to a new version and use the patch file instead of the py file for the one fix that is in it.

Updated spkg:
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/brian-1.4.1.p0.spkg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15261

Here's my current diff.  I won't have time to upgrade and test today, but hopefully tomorrow.  Note that 

```
$ diff -Naur src/brian/units.py patches/units.py
```
actually returns a lot of whitespace changes so this is better from that standpoint as well.

I may have to change the `p1` to something else or change the patch file slightly.

Sorry, I didn't even look - usually I see an announcement here or only after the release (here, apparently 5.13) is actually released.  But if it was earlier, great!
