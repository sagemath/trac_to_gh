I have made some reviewer changes, but I was wondering if you could explain the `TODO` note and why we can't do that here.

In real types, you see that I don't create the matrix and do the multiplication directly. This is the factor 10 speedup. For crg's I first wanted to properly get the left/right and primal/dual space actions correctly before considering to do the multiplication directly. But since the simple roots do not form a basis, I would need to also multiply with the base change matrix. So I removed the todo note...
