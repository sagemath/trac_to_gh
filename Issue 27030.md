I have started getting a handful of Segfaults on Cygwin.  Most of them look like this, in `isprime`:


```

I also get this one:

This probably started with #26442 but I'm still confirming.

Are these problems reproducible? Do they occur when running the tests individually?

It would also be good to know the precise value of the pari stack size (`pari.default("parisizemax")`). Does changing the value of `sizemax` in `src/sage/libs/pari/__init__.py` affect the crashes?

It's completely reproducible and deterministic, at least when running the test suite.  I haven't tried putting together a simpler way to reproduce it.  But it was definitely introduced by #26442, and it's caused by an infinite recursion, apparently, in `remove_from_pari_stack()`:

Would it be possible to check if it's an *infinite* recursion or just a very deep recursion, for example by increasing the process stack size (if this is possible on Cygwin)? GC is known to introduce deep-but-finite recursions (the Python trashcan mechanism was invented to deal with that).

> On Linux (at least the laptop that I'm writing this on), the default stack size is 8MB. So either programs under Cygwin use much more stack or there is indeed something else.

Just to compare I compiled / ran this little program on Linux and Windows:


```c
#include <stdio.h>


void recurse() {
    static int depth = 0;
    char c;
    printf("recursion depth: %d; stack at: %p\n", depth, &c);
    depth += 1;
    recurse();
}


int main(void) {
    recurse();
    return 0;
}
```


The major difference, between minor calling convention details, is that on Linux the `recurse` function has the preamble:


```
  40052d:       55                      push   %rbp
  40052e:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
  400531:       48 83 ec 10             sub    $0x10,%rsp
```


whereas on Windows it begins:


```
   1004010e0:   55                      push   %rbp
   1004010e1:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
   1004010e4:   48 83 ec 30             sub    $0x30,%rsp
```


where the extra 32 bytes reserved on the stack are a requirement of the Microsoft x64 calling convention.  And indeed, when I run the program on both systems with the stack limit set to 2MB, the Linux version was able to get just a little over 2 times deeper before overflowing.

That's just a trivial example though; not sure exactly how the numbers shake out with `Gen.__dealloc__()`/`remove_from_pari_stack()` recursions.  I would think the difference would e less extreme in that case.

So, 32MB should have been more than enough, and yet it wasn't.  I'll try once more with 64 MB just out of curiosity, but then I'll check if it's something else that's wrong...

I'll see if it fixes the problem here, and if so I can accept option 2 as well.

Okay, right. Increasing the stack size did appear to fix the crash in a few tests, such as


```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal.pyx
```


which now works, but did not with a smaller stack.

However, I'm still getting segfaults in `Gen.isprime` like


```
File "src/sage/libs/libecm.pyx", line 111, in sage.libs.libecm.ecmfactor
Failed example:
    N.is_prime()

this appears to be a totally separate issue from the stack overflow issue.  Here's the "interesting" part of the stack trace.  I'll have to build a debug version of PARI to find out more:
