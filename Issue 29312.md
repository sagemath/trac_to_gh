(from dimpase on #27823)

Bruno Haible says on [bug-autoconf](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2021-01/msg00033.html) that one should use gnulib's iconv module to install `config.rpath` etc. Indeed, 

```
gnulib-tool --import iconv
```

will install `config.rpath` into `config/` (among with other things that probably can be ignored).
So this is something to try in order to get rid of the hacky `install_config_rpath()` in comment:18

any reason for gnulib not being on `homebrew`?

upstream says: just use git to get `gnulib`, as there is nothing to build.
