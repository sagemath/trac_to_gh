this backend was partially just a warm-up for the CVXOPT SDP interface.

Besides, if you wanted to solve your LPs with an interior-point method, CVXOPT was the only way. Is it still the case?

I think the answer is yes; neither the GLPK backend nor the CPLEX backend seem to have support for these solvers' interior point algorithms.

Hello,

You should explain in the ticket description what is not working... and also provide doctests to show that it works now!

I am not sure that `NotImplementedError` is the right error for PPL `add_variable` method. PPL is precisely intended to solve problems over rationals number. I would rather use a `ValueError`.

PPL is a rational MIP solver, not just an LP solver. It's only the Sage backend that does not support setting variables to be integer-constrained.
That's why it's a `NotImplementedError`. I've created a ticket (#20351).

looks good. Do not forget to remove `NotImplementedError` from PPL backend once it can do integer/binary vars from #20354.

I tested CBC, but no CPLEX or GUROBI.
