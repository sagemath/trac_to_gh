Starting from current develop (6.3beta5), builds cleanly after make distclean, passes make ptestlong with "All tests passed".

Unless there are more python-specific tests I'm not aware of. it seems good.

Emmanuel, you should add yourself to the trac front page. Or be consistent in filling out the author/reviewer field ;-)

I'm afraid you're right (consistency is not a fully solved problem in statistics:-). However, since my knowledge of python is quite limited I thought that another reviewer, more versed in Python's mysteries (a. k. a. corner cases) should re-review this, without bothering with the basics I've covered. And *(s)he* should be listed as the (main) reviewer.

IMHO there is nothing to review. Upstream made a bugfix release, and we should update asap as long as our tests pass.

They do. Therefore it's good to go. It shold be marked as "solved" and merged in the next beta|rc.

(btw, ditto for 16629...)

I wonder if we'll ever get Python to pass its self-tests...
