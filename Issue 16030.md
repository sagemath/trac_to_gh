I have reviewed this patch, doctests pass, documentation builds. This is a positive review from my side, however, I keep the status as `needs_review` for the time being as this is not really my area in sage.

I add Robert Bradshaw to Cc as he was the last to change the most affected line ([2f182b](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=2f182bb14b55dc8abd2a783025419a34cd2d25bc)).

If there are no further comments, I'll set this to positive_review in a week.
