# Issue 31210: list_plot labels don't indicate exponential notation by default

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31447

Original creator: DavidLowry

Keywords: list_plot, plot

The plotting snippet ` list_plot([2**n for n in range(100)]) ` shows a plot that is almost right, except that the y-labels are incorrect. They show `1`, `2`, ... instead of something like `1e30`, `2e30`.

This might have to do with #30176, updating matplotlib to 3.3, and the different behavior of `OldScalarFormatter` and `ScalarFormatter` in matplotlib, but I'm not sure.

This was pointed out to me by Tom Hulse.

Possibly a duplicate of #30983. Give positive review if you think so.

That ticket links to reports on Ask Sage, where some workarounds are provided.
