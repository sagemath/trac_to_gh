This is the second instance of a known bug in integrate (see also #11590/#12731).

See #12691 for a background on stopgaps.

Similarly to my comment at #12731, I don't see how putting in a stopgap for #11493 is realistic.  We can't just tell people the integration code is buggy, because no matter how how many integrals you can do, there will always be some the pattern recognition misses... again, unless someone can do a detailed pattern search for things with `exp` with operands that are quadratic and then multiplied by something unusual...
