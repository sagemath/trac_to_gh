Zero does not hash there to zero, contrary to many other rings.

```
sage: hash(UniversalCyclotomicField().zero())
3713081631936575706
sage: hash(ZZ(0))
0
sage: hash(QQ(0))
0
```

one quick question in this context: is the following correct behaviour:

```
sage: for n in range(-3,2):
....:     print n,hash(n)
....:     
-3 -3
-2 -2
-1 -2  # this seems weird!
0 0
1 1
```

This is the choice made by python, and we stick with it.
