Instead of relying on running in an environment set up by `sage-env`, we should set up specific environment variables whenever we invoke executables. This will be configurable through `sage_conf`.

This is so that Sage is fully functional even when not being run from within `sage-env`.  This continues what was done in #29038/#30563 for Maxima.

As this ticket removes some hard-coded paths depending on `SAGE_LOCAL` from sagelib, it will reduce the need for patching for downstream packaging.
