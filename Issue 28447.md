# Issue 28447: Fixing precision of Tate elliptic curves over Qp

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28684

While reviewing #28645, I noticed a couple of problems in the file:

`src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_tate_curve.py`

1- We are always hitting `AttributeError` in the `try` blocks in `def parameter`, `def curve`, and `def _Csquare`, as it should be calling `precision_absolute` instead of `absolute_precision`

2- We should be checking `precision_relative`

3- If one fixes the above, the code would return the items with perhaps more precision than desired.

I have fixed the 3 items

Sorry about that. I changed the code a bit more and fixed the tests.

I added some small improvements to the documentation while we are at it. I tested the code and I am happy with it. If the new version is ok on the patchbot, I set it to positive review.
