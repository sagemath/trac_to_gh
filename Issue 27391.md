There are a couple of failures of teh sort

It's not due to this ticket (nothing to do with `pagerank`) but to #27480 which adds `pagerank`. We forgot to tag doctests as `# optional - python_igraph`, and I believe it's too late so we must wait for next beta, right ?

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-04-14 16:41:41

Can we set this ticket back to positive review ?

I changed the way we check if igraph is installed to avoid a pyflakes error.

looks good to me.

Well, let's do a follow up ticket since this is getting merged properly right now. Please refrain to introduce anymore call to `is_package_installed`, especially when checking for a python package. There is a proper python way to do this, like in the other sections of code using `igraph`- from `sage/graphs/digraph.py` line 693 onward

```
            try:
                import igraph
            except ImportError:
                raise ImportError(...)
```

replacing the `ImportError(...)` with `PackageNotFoundError` is acceptable.

`is_package_installed` is a big problem for sage-on-distro and it is a filthy quick and dirty hack that shouldn't ever have been included.

how about a ticket for getting rid of `is_package_installed()`? Or at least making sure it's not used on importable things? 

I wonder what pyflakes error one sees on a seemingly good try/except.

It is already on its way out. The only place it is not replaced by feature or something else at runtime is in `sage/databases/cremona.py` and there is a ticket for that. 

It is currently impossible to totally remove it. doctesting with `--option=all` relies on it (or other features of `packages.py` which is just as bad) :( and building with some optional package still depends on it look in `sage_setup/optional_extension.py `. In both case replacement are not easy.

Resolution: fixed

There is an issue with igraph on the arando patchbot with 8.8.b4 and 8.8.b5:

one can use a tag like `# abs tol 1e-12` and make the data 

```
    {0: 0.25, 1: 0.25, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.25}
```
