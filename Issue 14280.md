5.8 as on the "KAIST" online server: In webkit 1.10, at least, cells in the notebook often malfunction in that pressing "backspace" anywhere in the cell joins the cell with the preceeding one and hitting "enter" evaluates the cell. This happens at random, mostly. Though once an individual cell has started exhibiting this behaviour, it's practically impossible to get it back to function normally.
