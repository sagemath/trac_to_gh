CC:  vbraun dimpase kcrisman jhpalmieri

An important feature is to still be able to handle old `.sws` worksheets because a lot of pedagogical material was written on that format. With `9.0.beta8` (Python 3 by default), when i try:


```
sage -sws2rst worksheet.sws
```


i got:


```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sagenb'
```


Fair enough, i can still install `sagenb`. But then, the same command leads to:


```
ImportError: BeautifulSoup must be installed.
```


If try to install `BeautifulSoup`, which seems Python2 specific, i got:


```
"You're trying to run a very old release of Beautiful Soup under Python 3. This will not work."<>"Please use Beautiful Soup 4, available through the pip package 'beautifulsoup4'."
```


I can install `beautifulsoup4`, but it does not solve the issue since it is for Python 3.

Of course `sagenb` is written for Python 2, and migrating it to Python 3 would require too much work.

So, i guess the best solution would be to extract and translate the required material from `sagenb` to `sage` that would let `sage -sws2rst` work.

Jupiter's nbconvert provides conversion to rst. https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Thus, once sws is converted to jupyter, one can convert further, and the package created here is not needed.

At this point, unknown.  I think this would be a small enough constituency if Dima's suggestion is good that we could use that.  So if someone tested a few nontrivial `sws` worksheets and the result was usable and had roughly the same structure, I would think we could then provide this in documentation (perhaps adding something to the `sagenb_export` public-facing doc).

Of course, if this ticket is actually ready to go, maybe that's a moot point.

I added one of the test worksheets from Karl-Dieter.

After `sage -i tox`, the code can now be tested with it using 

```
./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sage_sws2rst/src && tox -v -v)'

It will need adjustments for python 3 and for the beautifulsoup 3->4 upgrade.

It is true, that sometimes it does not translates the html properly. For instance, the following paragraph appears in the file CIRM_Tutorial_3.rst:


```
`Project Euler Problem 6 <http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=6>`_

```


but I am quite sure it was the same problem before. From me it is a positive review.

Let's deal with blockquote and other missing styles in another ticket if somebody finds it desirable.
