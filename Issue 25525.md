Keywords: days94

As said in the title, the following is OK:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: sage_input(R, verify=True)
# Verified
ZZ['x']
```


But not the following:


```
sage: S.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: sage_input(S, verify=True)
AssertionError: Expected Sparse Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring == Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: sage_input(S)
ZZ['x']
sage: sage_input(S) == S
False
```
