Using Sage, you are missing a feature of the Magma command line interface. In Magma, if you enter a line found in history using up arrow key and then press down arrow key, then the next line in history is fetched. This feature allows you to fetch as many successive lines in history as you like. However, Sage does not have a similar feature. The  IPython command prompt uses the readline library (via pyreadline), which evidently does not support this feature. Magma has its own custom “readline-like” library, which does support this feature. (Since so many people have requested this feature, if anybody can figure out how to implement it, then such an implementation would certainly be welcome!)

This ticket addresses the above implementation.

Yes. I created this because I found no way to trigger the patchbot for the patch in #10289. I hope the patchbot works for this duplicate ticket.

I will add a comment on #10289 right now.

I have an `inputrc` file and several other customizations that I thought might be interfering, but could never figure it out.  Today I finally took the time and so I'm putting it here in case others have the same problem.  Below is what happens as best I understand it.  I'm on OS X 10.6.

Did you add the relevant lines into the "ipythonrc" as indicated in the documentation? You don't modify `inputrc` file in your home folder.


```
To bind these commands with keys, insert the relevant lines into the ``$DOT_SAGE/ipython/ipythonrc``
file. Note that ``$DOT_SAGE`` is ``$HOME/.sage`` by default. For example,

::

    readline_parse_and_bind "\C-o": operate-and-get-next
    readline_parse_and_bind "\e[A": history-search-backward-and-save
    readline_parse_and_bind "\e[B": history-search-forward-and-save

binds the three commands with the control-o key, the up arrow key, and the down arrow key,
respectively.           
```

This patch does not chanage anything before you put some relevant lines to the "ipythonrc" file in your dot_sage folder.

Yes.  I tried both and several other variations as well.  My problem was due entirely to the fact that somewhere `stty iexten` (or the equivalent) was being called and so it was impossible to get the `C-o` binding to work in any terminal application.
