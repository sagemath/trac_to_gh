Jean-Philippe, this is a preliminary version of the functionality you're currently using in jmol. The menu option "Camera Info" has been changed to "Get Viewpoint". When selected it will copy a string of the form "[x,y,z] angle" to your clipboard, which you can then paste directly into the Sage command.

RIght now there is no visible confirmation that the functionality is working. We could also have a pop-up alert with the same string, but I'm not particularly fond of those because they break the flow and create extra work.

Try it out for a few examples and let me know if this is close to what you want. The projection in the tikz images appears to be orthogonal, so it doesn't look exactly the same to me as the web page graphic.

Hi Paul,

I'm currently on the road for another week. I will test this as soon as I get some time; if not then right when I get back to the office.

Amazing!!!! It works perfectly in sage9.1beta2. I will be able to update the tutorial with this. The user experience will be much more simple! It's great!

For the orthogonal projection: yes that's how it works... Unfortunately, perspective is not really featured in tikz AFAIK.

Sorry for the delay it took... I put it in needs review for the sake of the patchbot. Once it has the green light, I believe it is good to go!
