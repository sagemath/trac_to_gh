`q1` and `q2` are isomorphic so they should have the same automorphism group 

```
sage: q1 = BinaryQF(0,2,1)                                                       
sage: q1.automorphism_group()                                                    
Matrix group over Integer Ring with 1 generators (
[-1  0]
[ 0 -1]
)
sage: q1                                                                         
2*x*y + y^2
sage: q2 = BinaryQF(1,2,0)
