# Issue 32767: BinaryQF fix a bug in automorphism_group

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33004

Original creator: sbrandhorst

`q1` and `q2` are isomorphic so they should have the same automorphism group 

```
sage: q1 = BinaryQF(0,2,1)                                                       
sage: q1.automorphism_group()                                                    
Matrix group over Integer Ring with 1 generators (
[-1  0]
[ 0 -1]
)
sage: q1                                                                         
2*x*y + y^2
sage: q2 = BinaryQF(1,2,0)                                                       
sage: q2.automorphism_group()                                                    
Matrix group over Rational Field with 2 generators (
[-1  0]  [ 1  2]
[ 0 -1], [ 0 -1]
)
```
