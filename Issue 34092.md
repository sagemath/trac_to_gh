In `src/sage/functions/bessel.py` and `src/sage/functions/jacobi.py`, why not creating the dictionary before the call to `BuiltinFunction.__init__` like that ?

```diff
+.       conversions = {'mathematica': 'SphericalBesselJ',
+                       'maxima': 'spherical_bessel_j',
+                       'sympy': 'jn'}
         BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, 'spherical_bessel_J', nargs=2,
-                                 conversions=dict(mathematica=
-                                                  'SphericalBesselJ',
-                                                  maxima='spherical_bessel_j',
-                                                  sympy='jn'))
+                                 conversions=conversions)
```


You should not touch `src/sage/parallel/ncpus.py` due to #34328.

en effet, merci

voici une nouvelle branche qui evite de toucher le fichier modifié par #34328

j'ai aussi defini le dictionnaire "conversions" à deux ou trois endroits
