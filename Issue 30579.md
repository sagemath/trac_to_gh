Keywords: maxima, integral

When computing this integral, Maxima asks whether 1 is zero or nonzero:

```
sage: var('x1,x2,y')
sage: assume(x1 > 0, x2 > 0, cos(y) != 0)
sage: f = sqrt(x1^2 - 2*x1*x2*cos(y) + x2^2)
sage: f.integrate(x1, algorithm='maxima')
...
ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax
 is 'assume(1>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is 1 zero or nonzero?
```


Attempting to add this as an assumption fails:

```
sage: assume(SR(1) > SR(0))
...
ValueError: Assumption is redundant
```

I get a slightly different behavior, but still buggy. Working w/ Maxima 5.44.0 on macOS.

With `domain: real` (default), I get "Is 1 zero or nonzero?" for the question, and if I respond `nz`, then I get a result (I didn't check it):



```
(-(x2^2*cos(y)^2*log(2*sqrt((-2*x1*x2*cos(y))+x2^2+x1^2)-2*x2*cos(y)+2*x1))/2)
 +(x2^2*log(2*sqrt((-2*x1*x2*cos(y))+x2^2+x1^2)-2*x2*cos(y)+2*x1))/2
 -(x2*cos(y)*sqrt((-2*x1*x2*cos(y))+x2^2+x1^2))/2
 +(x1*sqrt((-2*x1*x2*cos(y))+x2^2+x1^2))/2
```



With `domain: complex`, I get the same question and same result.

Not sure where the question is coming from. I will try to investigate a little.

`trace(?asksign1)` and then trying it again shows the expression which confuses asksign is `4*x2<sup>2*cos(y)</sup>2-4*x2^2`. In a fresh session, I get the buggy behavior with just


```
(%i1) asksign (4*x2^2*cos(y)^2-4*x2^2);
Is x2 zero or nonzero?

nz;
(%o1)                                 pos
(%i2) assume(x2 > 0);
(%o2)                              [x2 > 0]
(%i3) asksign (4*x2^2*cos(y)^2-4*x2^2);
Is 1 zero or nonzero?

nz;
(%o3)                                 pos
(%i4) asksign(4*x*cos(y)-4*x);
Is x positive, negative or zero?

p;
(%o4)                                 pos
(%i5) assume(x>0);
(%o5)                               [x > 0]
(%i6) asksign(4*x*cos(y)-4*x);
Is 1 zero or nonzero?

nz;
(%o6)                                 pos
(%i7) asksign(x*cos(y)-x);
Is 1 zero or nonzero?

nz;
(%o7)                                 pos
```

That's the simplest example I found. The presence of `cos(y)` seems important; without it I don't see the bug:

```
(%i8) asksign(x*y-x);
Is y - 1 positive, negative or zero?

p;
(%o8)                                 pos
(%i9) asksign(x*foo(y) - x);
Is foo(y) - 1 positive, negative or zero?

p;
(%o9)                                 pos
```

Just to be clear, `assume(x > 0)` is enough; assumptions on other variables, and the setting of `domain`, and the presence of `integrate` aren't required.
