This function leaks in via `sage.interfaces.all`.

I have used this function only for testing. But it seems people use get_display_manager to set display preferences in jupyter. It would be inconvenient if it should be imported first from an obscure place.

Perhaps we still need a deprecation warning about the change of import location?

I'd say we don't, according to the leak theory

Sorry, but what is the leak theory?

One argument for no deprecation warning might be that we already made an announcement that no library code should import from `all` modules. Is this what you meant?

I still don't know the leak theory. But I now agree that we don't need a deprecation warning.
