A similar enhancement could distribute symbolic products over the factors of their first (product) argument, but symbolic products are currently broken (see #22914).

This first implementation follows the guidelines [suggested](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/wLo2RQ-KSag/uyimvFsoCAAJ) by Ralf Stephan. It is probably highly perfectible :
* The implementation is "pure Sage" : I am aware of the possibility of speeding it considerably by declaring types to the necessary functions and their arguments, but I'm unsure about the relevant types (I'm quite novice in Cython...).
* I am not sure that this distribution should occur in every expansion : one could add a keyword to the `expand()` method/function, with edault value being either True or False (to be discussed).
* Since the `expand()` method essentially dispatches the work to the components of the `Expression`, This specialized expansion could (should ?) take place as a method of `Function_sum`, but I'm currently unablke on how to do this (this is my first ever attempt to work on the Sage symbolics in the library).

Suggestions, criticisms, even lazzi are welcome as long as they are constructive...

I'm not marking this as `needs_review`, since the documentation remains to be written. I may push a documentation patch and mark it `needs_review` soon.

Indeed...

But I'm beginning to have misgivings. "Distribute symbolic sums over sums" isn't lthe only case where this might be useful. We have also :
* Distribute symbolic products over products (when we have symbolic products...).
* Distribute sums (symbolic and add_vararg) over derivation (I currently get nonsense, BTW...)
* Ditto for integration.
and I may forget other "obvious" cases which are not obvious to me...

I'm starting to think that we may need a `distribute` method (with possibly optional arguments allowing to specify what should distributed over what), rather than (over)-extending the `expand` method.

What do you think ?  I'm setting this ticket to `needs_work` while expecting your comments

For what it's worth, Maxima has `declare(foo, additive)` (also `outative` and `linear`) which seems to have the desired effect. E.g.


```
    (%i2) 'sum(f(i) + g(i), i,1,n);
    (%o2) 'sum(g(i)+f(i),i,1,n)

    (%o4) 'sum(g(i),i,1,n)+'sum(f(i),i,1,n)
```


That's handled by the global simplifier, so it's all or nothing -- you can't expand one expression and not another. Dunno if that's an issue. Also, this action is purely formal -- if it's an infinite sum, the simplifier happily plows ahead without testing convergence.

There is also a more general mechanism for distributing operators and functions over other operators and functions, via the symbol property DISTRIBUTE_OVER. This is used to distribute some functions over lists, matrices, and equations. The declaration has to be in Lisp, e.g. `:lisp (setf (get 'mfoo 'distribute_over) '(mbar mbaz mquux))` which says that operator MFOO distributes over MBAR, MBAZ, and MQUUX. Again the general simplifier puts that declaration into effect.

Dear Robert,

Sorry, I didn't see your (quite enlightening) answer until right now (tywo weeks later).

I've implemented (part of) what I want in #22937. But I'll consider comparing tgis implementation with changing the relevant properties on-the-fly to the same effect.

Anyway, the present ticket is abandoned. I just forgot to close it.
