I'm translating a FAQ which changed completely since the Italian translation and I found the word "vendor" used as a verb.
I can sort of guess its meaning, but looking online on English dictionaries "vendor" is only used as a noun. Can someone clarify this point?

Moreover, the online version of the FAQ (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-general.html#wouldn-t-it-be-way-better-if-sage-did-not-ship-as-a-gigantic-bundle) is different from the one shipped with 9.2.beta6. Is this due to recent changes or is the website outdated?
