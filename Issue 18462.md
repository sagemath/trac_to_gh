Turns out that at least some progress was made at ​http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n/Italian toward this goal. Maybe it can get in eventually?

Great! Now, it suffice to 
- put those files to the `$SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/it/` directory (with the same structure as for the english directory)
- configure your git and git-trac (see the developer'd manual)
- create a git branch related to this ticket `git trac checkout 18699`)
- add the file to the stagging area (`git add <file>`)
- commit your changes (`git commit -m '<message>'`)
- push your changes (`git trac push`)
- set this ticket to `needs_review`

Ivo, if you feel like fixing at least the FAQ portion of this, it would be great contribution from a native speaker.


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-01 09:26:37

What's sage stand on accent marks?
I see that in this branch `è` is written as `e'`, `\`e` and `e\``. If I'm not wrong Sphinx can handle utf-8 characters.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-01 09:28:07

Go full utf-8, sure.

I'm translating a FAQ which changed completely since the Italian translation and I found the word "vendor" used as a verb.
I can sort of guess its meaning, but looking online on English dictionaries "vendor" is only used as a noun. Can someone clarify this point?

Moreover, the online version of the FAQ (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-general.html#wouldn-t-it-be-way-better-if-sage-did-not-ship-as-a-gigantic-bundle) is different from the one shipped with 9.2.beta6. Is this due to recent changes or is the website outdated?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-01 14:01:10

"to vendor" (software) means to make a copy for the project rather than use what is provided by the system

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-01 14:42:57

I rebased on 9.2.beta6 and done some FAQ. 
Do we have the 80-column rule on .rst files?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-01 15:12:52

not really, but please no extra long lines.

that is to say, a line should fit on screen, also so that diffs are reasonably short.


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-03 08:04:04

In the faq-usage file (English version as well), is stated that Sage ships with Python 2.6.x.
If I recall correctly, Sage 9.x should ships with 3.7.3.
Am I right?

See FAQ https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#how-do-i-import-sage-into-a-python-script


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-03 09:13:04

9.2 will ship with 3.7.x

3.8.x is in the works, though.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-03 09:14:45

please also do this change on English FAQ - and remove the section on OSX 10.4 please, too.

is this now ready to be merged? Or there are still parts that have not been touched for more than a year?


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-06 08:02:32

The FAQ are done. It would be nice to have someone else check for typos.
I also started looking at the other files (although I'm giving priority to other tickets) but it will take a while before I get through all of them.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-06 08:17:55

Can we create a separate ticket with Italian FAQ (so that it can be merged quickly)?

I doubt the urgent need for Dev manual in Italian (there are no other translations AFAIK)

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-08-13 19:37:18

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.


---

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-08-13 19:37:18

There is already #19025 for the developer guide.

Please remove the following code from the branch. It breaks the patchbots, causing them to run out of disk space, so I am detaching the branch from the ticket for now.

```
.. code-block:: python

    sage: cython('while True: print("Hello")')
```



---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-14 07:49:22

what was the branch name?


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-14 07:57:37

public/18699

I'm on it. I've removed the develop guide (since we have #19025) and also the FAQ (#30301).
Now I'm building the documentation to check that everything works

(also updating to 9.2.beta8)

Thank you. The current branch does not seem to differ from develop now.

Ivo, you forgot to add the good changes!

where actually was that code, in what files/commits?


---

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2020-08-15 10:09:26

It was in `src/doc/it/developer/coding_in_cython.rst`, see for example [3d92c396bfd528b4d](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=3d92c396bfd528b4d6b451c4c18b1541c1f4f706).

Since there is #30301 for the FAQ and #19025 for the developer guide, it seems there is nothing else to do here, so let us close this as duplicate.
