Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: CyclotomicField

Something strange is happening with the command CyclotomicField and the order of the associated generator. Everything works very well for n which is different from 2 mod 4 but does not work for n =2 mod 4 as seen in the following lines.


{{{sage: k.<s>=CyclotomicField(7)

sage: gap(s) 

E(7) 

sage: k(_) 

s

sage: k.<s>=CyclotomicField (6) 

sage: gap(s) 

E(3) 

sage: k(gap(s)) s - 1

}}}
