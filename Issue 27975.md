# Issue 27975: Optimizing all_periodic_points() for small periods

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28212

Original creator: @Zopherus

Keywords: SI2019

Currently, the all_periodic_points() method uses an algorithm that reduces the function modulo p and checks for possible cycle lengths and lifts. This method may be slow in certain cases, such as x^2 - 3/4, where we resort to calling the periodic_points() method which solves for the dynatomic polynomial.

This ticket depends on ticket #28109 so it needs to be added to dependencies.

This optimization is already done in #28109 as part of the major overhaul of the periodic point functionality.
