You added a doctest to `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx` but the polynomial is over `QQ`.

I confirm the hash are correct, and that the bug also existed over the integers.

Since the bug is considered as [very serious](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/fu1De-Cy9nw), it might be worth being in production in a bug-fix release (with other serious bugs such as #17806).
