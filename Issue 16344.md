Hi Miguel,

Why did you include tides in source instead of making a spkg? The sources of packages are not under git management. You would better follow the instructions at [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html).

EDIT: I see it is at #16578... sorry for the noise

COMMENT: in the list of commit above it is **very** hard to see which are the one associated to that ticket!!

Hi. I'm Marcos Rodriguez, a developer of TIDES.

Thank you very much for the reviewing effort.

In the numerical computation of a differential equation, the bottleneck is at the computation of the taylor series coefficients (code generated by the parser). Therefore, this scheme should be as much optimized as possible via compiler. So, a dynamical function call for this part would slow down the computation significantly.

Besides, the original goal of MathTIDES (the parser written in Mathematica) was the generation of C of Fortran code which compilation and execution is independent of the symbolic preprocessor (Mathematica in this case) so that it can be tweaked or integrated in other C or Fortran codes for different purposes.

We think that the natural extension is to compile, execute and display this code in a free symbolic preprocessor.

Hello.

Do you think that after the changes, a possitive revision can be given (with possible minor changes), or it would need a complete rewrite.
The reason for me to ask is that we are writing a paper about TIDES and integration using Taylor Method and we would like to include comparisons using Sage-tides and anounce the Sage version of the package as a completely free version of the software.

Thank you very much.
