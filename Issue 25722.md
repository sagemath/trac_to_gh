# Issue 25722: Vector tuples: linear algebra with vectors that aren't encoded as lists

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25959

Original creator: @darijgr

Original creation time: 2018-07-27 17:29:31

Keywords: linear algebra, vectors, combinatorialfreemodule, sagedays@icerm

Nicolas Thi√©ry and I have two rather different "packages" (at this moment, badly documented research code) that implement various operations on lists of vectors which are not given as lists of numbers but rather in other forms (CombinatorialFreeModule, PolynomialRing, etc.). Such lists can be used to model finitely generated vector subspaces, and one can e.g. compute the intersection of two such subspaces.

At the moment, the main tasks are the following:

**1.** Clean up & document my code ( https://github.com/darijgr/sage-subspace ).

**2.** Clean up & document Nicolas's code ( https://hackmd.io/nASHoTekSqK3Yxb-x-S5dg#Darij%E2%80%99s-suggested-abstract-class ).

**3.** Write an abstract base class ("AbstractVectorList") that both of the above should inherit from. Current status: https://cocalc.com/projects/4d9989aa-aaf2-4ee2-8a08-c40a10c40048/files/Projects/subspace/subspace.py (SageDays-internal; should probably be put on the above repo?).

**4.** Write glue code to make this work with existing structures -- e.g., polynomial rings, matrices etc.

I imported all my code in sage_subspace (with no refactoring yet), and made the latter a pip installable package, with demo notebook and binder support.

For the features, see the doc:

Darij: I am now taking of for vacations. You may want to add a brief example of use of subspace to the demo, to attract attention and also as a way for you to see the current interface.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

I also have related preliminary code, for infinite-dimensional vector spaces (and algebras) generated by indicator functions of polyhedra and finite- and infinite-dimensional subspaces thereof.

Changing keywords from "linear algebra, vectors, combinatorialfreemodule, sagedays@icerm" to "linear algebra, vectors, combinatorialfreemodule, sagedays@icerm, sd109".

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
