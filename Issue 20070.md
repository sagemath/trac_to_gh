`cython`'s upgrade is to be dealt with at #20192. Note that the patch has been dropped.

Just to get this straight, because there will be another Cython release in the future we are not updating to the latest currently released version?

For some reason I thought you had `0.24` in there. Probably not completely in the action when I first looked at it. That and for some reasons I thought `0.23.5` and `0.24` had been released almost together but `0.24` is indeed still in beta.
