# Issue 33628: direct computation of .formal()[1] for elliptic-curve morphisms

Follow-up to #33216: We can compute `.formal()[1]` directly, i.e., without going through `.formal()`. This is beneficial as the latter uses the rational maps, which can be very expensive.

* Composite isogenies have multiplicative `.formal()[1]`.
* Isogenies using Vélu's or Kohel's formulas are normalized, hence `.formal()[1] == 1`. We only need to account for pre- and post-isomorphism.
* Weierstrass isomorphisms `(u,r,s,t)` have `.formal()[1] == u`.

Same example as for #33216:

```sage
E = EllipticCurve(j=GF(431^2)(4))
phi = E.isogeny(2^99*E.gens()[0])
_ = phi.dual()
%timeit phi._EllipticCurveIsogeny__dual = None; phi.dual()
```


Sage 9.6:

```
537 ms ± 6.75 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```


This branch:

```
294 ms ± 1.71 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

This looks great, and well worth doing.  My only comment is that all these `_scaling_factor()` methods should be user-acessible, i.e. not have the underscore, since this is a useful number associated to an isogeny -- one that I have often needed to access.

At the same time, perhaps we can have in the docstring a definition of this "scaling factor".  I would say something like this:  it is the factor u (in the base field) such that $\phi^*\omega_2 = u \omega_1$, where $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ is the isogeny and for $i=1,2$, $\omega_i$ is the standard Weierstrass differential, i.e. $dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)$.

[Sorry, I forgot that trac does not understand latex.]

Thank you for the suggestion! I changed it to `.scaling_factor()` and added your definition (with minor tweaks) to the documentation.

Sorry about the delay in coming back to this.
I would give a positive review, but do not understand the "test fail" flag.  I looked at the logs and tere were no failing tests, the log just stops in the middle.

Is it possible to get the test to re-run?

The patchbot log here on Trac is fully green and looks complete over here. Maybe your browser hadn't finished loading it all the way to the end?

On [GitHub](GitHub) Actions (the source of the alarmingly red "Build & Test | failing" icon), there is a single test failure, but it seems entirely unrelated to this patch:

Thanks for the quick help.  I do now see the whole log file.  I'll give this a positive review then.
