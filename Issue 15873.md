I have made a standalone branch available as u/chapoton/16110

Of course, it still depends on set factories, but not *in the branch*.

here is a branch that applies, your was not applying anymore.

Adrien, is this "needs review" ?

Bonjour à tous,

Sage does not start with the branch applied.

```

To solve some merge/rebase difficulties. I create a new branch with all the
code present in the branch (e467677f92400e46cb27142e0623e693aa5db2ac).

I add the parallelogram polyominoe in the documentation.

Still need more doc, every function must be documented:

```
combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py: 80.9% (72 of 89)
```


Some error in doc formatting:

```
+[dochtml] [combinat ] /home/worker/sage-patchbot/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py:docstring of sage.combinat.parallelogram_polyomino.default_tikz_options:10: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.

```


The function "breadth_node_paths_generator" has been given another name in #16204. So doctests here do not pass.

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-07-30 13:25:39

I have made a refreshed branch. There still remains 

1) to have full and clean documentation

2) to adapt to the new standard of global options introduced by #18555

you should not use xrange but range

you should use python3 syntax for print, namely print("stuff")

And also should be lazy-imported.

Comment by slabbe created at 2017-06-15 12:21:48

Two small comments to start:

1. I would change `to_parallelogram_polyomino_Boussicault_Socci` to `_to_parallelogram_polyomino_Boussicault_Socci` since it is available through the method `to_parallelogram_polyomino`.

2. I suggest to support Python 3 syntax as most as possible for any new module to get into sage for example by adding the following line at the top of the module:

```
# Support of Python 3
from __future__ import division, absolute_import, print_function, unicode_literals
```



---

Comment by slabbe created at 2017-06-15 12:53:49

Some more comments (just looking at the code, no test done yet):

3. `_get_path_in_pair_of_tree_from_box` similar methods do not have doctests.

4. (many occurrences) References format do not follow the conventions:


```
+        By default, we use the bijection from the following article :
+            Ref. Delest, M.-P. and Viennot, G.
+            "Algebraic Languages and Polyominoes Enumeration."
+            Theoret. Comput. Sci. 34, 169-206, 1984.
+            (the bijection is described in the previous article on page 179 
+            and 180. An example is given in Figure 6)
```


See [this page of the developper's manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings):


```
All bibliographical references should be stored in the master bibliography file,
 SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst, in the format [...]
```


5. Out of curiosity, why does the `class _polyomino_row:` needs to be inside the class instead of simply in the module?

6. The class


```
class _drawing_tool:
    r"""
    Technical class to produce TIKZ drawing.
```


is of larger interest than just the parallelogram polyominoes (I often need such thing). But I think it is anormal to


```
sage: from sage.combinat.parallelogram_polyomino import _drawing_tool
```


I think you should rather create a new module:


```
sage: from sage.misc.tikz import DrawingTool
```


I have the idea of geting my module [TikzPicture](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe/blob/develop/slabbe/tikz_picture.py) into sage in the future. The class `DrawingTool` and `TikzPicture` could go in the same module. I let you create that module first into Sage.

For example if you install my package with `sage -pip install slabbe`, you may do:


```
sage: L = [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
sage: from slabbe import TikzPicture
sage: TikzPicture(latex(pp)).pdf()
'[...]/62669/tikz_mZXN3H.pdf'
```

Comment by slabbe created at 2017-06-15 13:33:15

7. `bounce` and `bounce_path` methods have no `INPUT` block.

8. Use one line instead of three in the example of `area`, `bounce` and `bounce_path` methods (other occurrences?):


```
sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(
....:     [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
....: )
sage: pp.area()
1

sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(
....:     [[1], [1]]
....: )
```


9. bad REST formatting in method `box_is_root` (missing :: maybe)

10. In `from_dyck_word`, add ```` around the string `'Delest-Viennot'`

11. In `from_dyck_word`, it says the default is foo, but it is `None`.

12. In `get_node_position_from_box`, mention the default value:


```
nb_crossed_nodes – a list containg just one integer.
```


13. INPUT block is missing in `is_k_directed`.

14. In `to_binary_tree` and `to_dyck_word` and `to_ordered_tree`, documentation does not follow the convention:


```
!diff
-- ``bijection`` – None (default) The name of bijection to use for 
-  the convertion. The possible value are, ‘Aval-Boussicault’.
+- ``bijection`` -- string or ``None`` (default: ``None``) The name of bijection to use for 
+  the convertion. The possible value are ``None`` or ``'Aval-Boussicault'``.
```


15. The string starting with `This global option contains all the data needed by the Parallelogram classes to draw, display in ASCII, compile in latex a parallelogram polyomino.` should contain an `EXAMPLE::` block. Similarly with the string starting with `    This is the default TIKZ options. This option is used to configurate element of a drawing to allow TIKZ code generation.`.

16. coverage is still not 100%:

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage/combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py: 93.8% (90 of 96)
```

17. (this is a preference of myself, you may prefer to ignore it if you want). I prefer

this

```
sage: L = [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
sage: pp=ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
```

or

```
sage: A = [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]
sage: B = [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]
sage: pp=ParallelogramPolyomino([A, B])
```

to

```
sage: pp=ParallelogramPolyomino(
....:     [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
....: )
```


18. Also, the Python convention says to add space here:

```diff
-sage: pp=ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
+sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
```

19. `sage: ParallelogramPolyominoes?` should mention in the INPUT and EXAMPLES blocks the case `size=None`.


---

Comment by slabbe created at 2017-06-15 13:50:39

20. This is strange:


```
sage: P = ParallelogramPolyominoes()
sage: P.is_finite()
True
```


21. This does not work (but maybe it is okay to not work):


```
sage: P = ParallelogramPolyominoes()
sage: len(list(P.some_elements()))    # this works
100
sage: P.random_element()
...
TypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'PlusInfinity'
```



---

Comment by slabbe created at 2017-06-15 13:56:29

Changing the status to needs work (oups, it was already!).

Other than that, I get

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py
    [484 tests, 3.09 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

Tell me when it needs a next round of review.

In think it is a bug of set_factories. 
This example show the problem : 


```
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories import *
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories_example import *
sage: XYPairs()
AllPairs
sage: APS = XYPairs()
sage: APS.is_finite()
True
```


I will report that bug.

Now we have 100% of coverage.

In ParallelogramPolyominoesFactory, I have commented the function add_constraint() that become nonImplemented, because i don't use them in the set_factory. I don't know if it is a good way to solve the problem, but I don't use that function, so, I don't know how to test it.

Comment by chapoton created at 2017-06-15 19:56:37

This is not correct :

```
+            EXAMPLES::
+
+            sage: PP=ParallelogramPolyomino
```

because you must indent the test lines by 4 spaces.

This is not correct :

```
+        EXAMPLES::
+            sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(
```

because you must have an empty line after `EXAMPLES::`

This is not a correct way to add a doctest :

```
         Return a default policy.
+
+        sage: ParallelogramPolyominoes._default_policy
```

because you have forgotten `EXAMPLES::`

You can just remove "add_constraints(self, cons, args_opts):", I think.

Comment by mantepse created at 2017-12-26 16:48:42

I would like to see this merged!  Here are a few comments concerning docstrings:

* the error messages in `check` need spell- and semantic checking :-)

* the references should be moved to `sage-develop/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`

* I do not understand the docstring in lines 819-821:

```
    `@`staticmethod
    def __classcall_private__(cls, *args, **opts):
        r"""
        Ensure that parallelogram polyominoes created by the enumerated sets
        and directly are the same and that they are instances of
        :class:`ParallelogramPolyomino`.
```


* docstrings of `widths` (line 1702) and `heights` (line 1843) should begin with imperative.

* concerning `val` (line 1976): this looks like a useful function, why not make it public?  It's docstring should be `Determine whether the cell at the given position is inside the parallelogram polyomino.`

* docstring of `_polyomino_row` could be `This is an internal class representing a single row of a parallelogram polyomino.`

* `diagramme` in line 2434 should be `diagram`.

There is no particular reason. Just to highlight that this class is a small tool dedicated to ParallelogramPolyominoe.

Merging All Drawing Tools coming from you tikz package and the drawing tools of ParallelogramPolyomino is a big work : 
 - we need to list all the needed functionality
 - we need to merge the ParallelogramPolyomino codes and the code of your package
 - we need to integrate the result on sage
 - we need to make tests and documentation

I think its better to open a new ticket in order to close this one.
We will treat that new ticket after this one.

I opened that new ticket : ticket #26508

I don't find what is the problem. Can you expand on that remark ?

All the corrections of comment 85 was done.

The function __classcall_private__ needs to be implemented to work with SetFactory.
With that function, the parent method will work correctly.

1. I just reviewed the code. Looks good to me. I did some trivial modifications while I was looking at it. I allowed myself to push a commit on top of the public branch.

2. Using Sage with Python 3, I get 3 failures (see below). So I change the status to needs work because of that:

3. The branch now contains more than 70 commits including lots of merge with the most recent develop branch of Sage. I would suggest to rebase the branch on top of the most recent develop version of sage so that the history tree do not get to dirty because of this ticket. You may try `git rebase -i HEAD~3` to rebase the last 3 commits for instance (this is usually what I do). Of course, rebasing the branch will change the hash of all involved commits. So this is okay only if nobody have code depending on that branch.
