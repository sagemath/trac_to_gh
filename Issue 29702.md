In `src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py` there have been four doctest claiming to be precice up to `1e-9` for random geodesics.

Unfortunatly, this assumes `set_random_seed(0)` and the claim is far from true for many "random" values. In #29936 we specified the precision for which this does hold, which is not much. This should be fixed.
