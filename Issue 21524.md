The Chow ring of a matroid was implemented in ticket #19587.  However, there is a small error in the set of quadratic relations.  The line 

    Q = [gens[i] * gens[i+j+1] for i,F in enumerate(flats) for j,G in enumerate(flats[i+1:]) if F < G or G < F]

should read

    Q = [gens[i] * gens[i+j+1] for i,F in enumerate(flats) for j,G in enumerate(flats[i+1:]) if not (F < G or G < F)]

since the quadratic relations are imposed when two flats are incomparable.
