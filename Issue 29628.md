Okay.  I was going to say, it seems like sage-objects still depends too heavily on too much of `sage.categories`.  For my purposes I would want it to be as light-weight as possible.

I think it might also be worth it to further divide `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` into some `SageObjectBase`, `ParentBase`, and `ElementBase` that only provide the minimal C-level type structs necessary to bootstrap the rest of the hierarchy.

For `SageObject` this is trivial because its type struct is empty.  For `Parent` and `Element` the `Base` classes need to consist primarily of any cdef attributes which define the type struct.  Anything else is optional and can be bolted on in a subclass.

It seems that there is not much to do with just categories with no constructible objects. This is of course expected.

I have the doctest failures of `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` on develop branch. So they seem not related with the present branch.

Then what are these messages starting with ===.... test session starts ...===, which shows some failure?

I tested with the branch of this ticket, perhaps from a user point of view. I finds it works well, as advertised in the description. So I am positive with the branch.

But I am not capable of reading the code, most of which looks to me cryptic, to give any useful comments. So I leave this task to other reviewer well versed with sage build system and python build tools.

However, if no one gives more comments, then I will set positive review once we have a green bot, as this ticket needs to be closed before sage 9.5 release.
