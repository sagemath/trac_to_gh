Something seems to get very confused about values from sysconfig as it tries to replace `xcrun` by `g++`.

Find and execute the named command line tool from the active developer

The active developer directory can be set using `xcode-select`, or via the
DEVELOPER_DIR environment variable. See the xcrun and xcode-select manual
pages for more information.

Options:

Upstream python does have a bad history of compiler/linker support (especially differentiation between C and C++ actually).

There was already a test that the system python (in the venv) is able to build a C extension.
The change tightens this check by imposing the configured `CC` (and `CXX`) values -- because this is what the actual build will be running.
It also adds the same test for building a C++ 11 extension.

It's probably the old problem of not having the right perl modules present and Sage's polymake build system failing to recognize that. The instructions in polymake's SPKG.txt are no longer valid.

In any case, the polymake problems should be dealt with at #29054.
