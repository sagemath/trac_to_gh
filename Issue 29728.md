in `sage/graphs/connectivity.pyx`, you added `# known bug`, but the issue is fixed in #29958.

in `sage/graphs/generators/random.py` it might be better to do

```diff
-    EXAMPLES: We show the edge list of a random graph with 3 backbone
+    EXAMPLES:
+
+    We check a random graph with 12 backbone
     nodes and probabilities `p = 0.7` and `q = 0.3`::
```
