Note that the Python wrapper `symengine.py` uses CMake to find the library (via the CMake metadata installed in `local/lib/cmake/symengine`) - so that's what `spkg-configure.m4` should use too. Of course, this assumes that system `cmake` is available; but I think it's fine to only use system `symengine` when also system `cmake` is present.

This requires writing cmake config script, i.e. `CMakeLists.txt`, as far as I can see.
Integrating this into `spkg-configure.m4` is above my pay grade...

If we need a specific feature in newer versions of symengine, we can test for that feature instead of the version. And if nobody knows what features we need... then as a last resort, we can accept any version of symengine, and any consequent bug reports will tell us what we should have checked for.

There's a `symengine_version()` C function that you can call to get it.
Or you can use the following program to see if it compiles,

```
#include <symengine/symengine_config.h>
#if (SYMENGINE_MAJOR_VERSION*10000 + SYMENGINE_MINOR_VERSION*100 + SYMENGINE_PATCH_VERSION < 00700)
# error "SymEngine 0.7.0 or newer is required"
error

Just create a directory `conftest.dir` and generate the file in there
