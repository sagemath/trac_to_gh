Families of charts on a manifold are quasiordered by set inclusion of domains, ignoring `coord_string`.  Subqosets can be defined by filtering by `coord_string`; an optional argument of `Manifold.chart_poset` will do this.

As in #31736, the poset quotients by the equivalence relation, so its elements are finite families of charts that have the same domain.

Probably perfect substitute for the current `display` implementation of scalar fields.

I think this quasi order is exactly what we need for presheaves.

Since the set of frames as well as of charts each constitute a presheaf, what if we wrap this up in #31703?

Besides, what do you mean with "Subqosets"?

But when we take `coord_string` into account again, shouldn't this become a poset? So you mean subqosets that are actual posets, right?

Two subsets with a different name can turn out to be equal. If two restrictions of a chart are defined on these two subsets, then I think these will be distinct but equal elements of the qoset as well.

Sure, that would work; perhaps you can expand that ticket's description a bit.
