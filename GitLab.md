Some [SageMath](SageMath) development is also happening on [GitLab](GitLab).

We run a read-only [mirror of the official branches](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/) , a read-only [mirror of the branches that people work on on trac](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac/) , and a [collaborative workspace](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/) (contact any of the developers there if you want to get access.)

Currently, images for â€‹https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sagemath/sagemath are not built automatically anymore. The main issue seems to be that there are no dedicated runners registered there anymore.

There are likely other problems since the [GitLab](GitLab) Pipeline has not been running for ages now. There does not seem to be a real interest in using [GitLab](GitLab) for [SageMath](SageMath) development.
