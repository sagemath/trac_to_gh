As deduced from [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47620/stopiteration-raised-during-geulerian_circuit/):


```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_vertex(0)
sage: G
Graph on 1 vertex
sage: G.eulerian_circuit()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 G.eulerian_circuit()

/opt/sagemath/sage-source/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in eulerian_circuit(self, return_vertices, labels, path)
   4001                     edges.append(e if labels else (e[0], e[1]))
   4002             else:

   4004 
   4005                 if next_edge[0] == v:  # in the undirected case we want to

StopIteration:
