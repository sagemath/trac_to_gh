Original creator: jhpalmieri

The following tickets relate to building Python 3 and some Python-related packages on OS X; many of the changes are also relevant to other platforms:

- #22756: Python 3 build is broken on OS X
- #22764: remove the symlink `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python`
- #22770: do not build `functools32` when `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` (also related: #22582, which includes the change in #22770)
- #22772: Sage's configuration of `matplotlib` tries to write ascii in binary mode, leading to problems with Python 3

All of the relevant tickets are now fixed. Does someone need to review this, or should it just be closed?

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
