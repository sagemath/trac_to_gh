This distribution package would provide `sage.libs.ntl` and all functionality that Sage draws from NTL, mostly:

 - `rings.padics`
 - `rings.polynomial`
 - `rings.finite_rings`
 - `rings.number_field`
 - `matrix.cyclo_dense`, `.integer_dense`.
 - a few more random places

There are a few places from which we can eliminate the dependency on NTL as a preparation:

 - #29910: `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro`: Remove dependency on NTL
 - `sage.rings.polynomial.evaluation`

------

This is part of Meta-ticket #29705: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (distutils packages). The modules are recombined with the rest of sagelib via the native namespace package functionality.
