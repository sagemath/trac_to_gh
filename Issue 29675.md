This distribution package would provide `sage.libs.ntl` and all functionality that Sage draws from NTL, mostly:

- `rings.padics`
- `rings.polynomial`
- `rings.finite_rings`
- `rings.number_field`
- `matrix.cyclo_dense`, `.integer_dense`.
- a few more random places

There are a few places from which we can eliminate the dependency on NTL as a preparation:

- #29910: `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro`: Remove dependency on NTL
- `sage.rings.polynomial.evaluation`

------

This is part of Meta-ticket #29705: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (distutils packages). The modules are recombined with the rest of sagelib via the native namespace package functionality.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29912
