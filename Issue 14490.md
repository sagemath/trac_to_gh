OK, I check on a vanilla 5.12.beta1 and there is one more doctest failure as with 0.7.2 on sage-on-gentoo:

```

```

Why did you change

```
(x^y-z).integrate(y,algorithm="sympy")
```

to

```
(x*y-z).integrate(y,algorithm="sympy")
```

One needs a good reason to remove doctests.

Because now SymPy returns a `Piecewise` object for that integral, which can't be converted back to Sage. Making the conversion work would actually require a change in SymPy, since currently we look for the `_sage_` method in SymPy objects, which isn't defined for `Piecewise`.

I couldn't think of anything else to do except modifying the doctest, at least until the conversions are fixed upstream. What do you suggest?

At least, mark the existing doctest `# known bug`.

I would catch instead of changing it so we can know when it is fixed. In any case I will contact sympy upstream shortly about it.

Thank you Aaron, I will see if I can submit a pull request adding `_sage_` methods. It would be good for SymPy and Sage to interface better to each other.

New patch added. How does this one look?

When marking a test `# known bug`, you should add the doctest result what you **want** to get, not what you actually get. In other words, just add `# known bug` without changing the result of the test.
