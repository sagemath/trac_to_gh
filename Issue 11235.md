Patch does not apply to 5.0.beta11, I'm afraid

Message for Florent:

For information, your patch does not commute with mine about enumeration modulo the action of a permgroup. I try to push back my patch in the queue but i didn't manage to do it without breaking the queue... Sorry for that...

Hello Florent,

I rebased the patch on 5.8 but then sage fails to compile with the following messages.

```
sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Overriding final methods is not allowed

sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Only final types can have final Python (def/cpdef) methods
```


It seems that the problem is with the `__exit__` method.

Hey Florent,

Looks good minus the one missed change in the review patch I've uploaded. After you give it a quick check, and you set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
