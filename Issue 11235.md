Hello Florent,

I rebased the patch on 5.8 but then sage fails to compile with the following messages.

```
sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Overriding final methods is not allowed

sage/structure/list_clone.pyx:1826:10: Only final types can have final Python (def/cpdef) methods
```


It seems that the problem is with the `__exit__` method.
