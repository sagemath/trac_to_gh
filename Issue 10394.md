# Issue 10394: add pexpect interface to sbcl

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10447

Original creator: jrp

Assignee: was

Keywords: sbcl, lisp

I added a pexpect interface to sbcl.  It is similar to the ECL lisp interface.  This was requested by Sara Billey.


```

sage: sbcl(3)*sbcl(8)
24
sage: sbcl.eval('(* 5 5)')
'25'
sage: sbcl_console()
This is SBCL 1.0.40.0.debian, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

* (* 5 5)

25
* sage: sbcl.set('x',10)
sage: sbcl.get(x)
'10'
sage: sbcl.read("a.lisp")
sage:
```

Is the data/extcode part tracked somewhere else? I would like to have them all in one patch.

Changing component from interfaces to interfaces: optional.
