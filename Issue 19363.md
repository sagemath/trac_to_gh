Just a note,

`egrep -R 'EX...+::' src/sage | fgrep -v EXAMPLES:: | fgrep -v EXAMPLE:: | fgrep -v 'EXAMPLES ::'`

also founds `EXAXMPLES` and `EXMAPLES`.

(E: And `egrep -R 'PLES ?::' src/sage | fgrep -i -v example` founds `EXAPLES`.)

it's too late to correct them there, because of positive review.

please open another ticket, and do the job.
