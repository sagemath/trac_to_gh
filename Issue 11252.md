# Issue 11252: Build Integer from Unicode

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2011-06-03 12:50:20

Assignee: vdelecroix

Keywords: Integer, unicode

Currently, Sage fails to build Integer from Unicode

```
sage: Integer(u'1')
TypeError Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'unicode'> to an integer
```


The two lines patch attached to this ticket, allow such feature

```
sage: Integer(u'1')
1
```

Patch fixes the reported problem.  Did 'make testlong' and all tests passed.  Positive review!

1. The commit message of the patch should be changed.
 2. Could you give a less trivial example in the doctest?  At least something with more than one digit and something hexadecimal (`Integer(u'0x2A')`) or so...
