Primarily just because the main 'website' page has an em-dash to start if off.

Was trying something much harder that is actually useful, but this is all I was able to accomplish concretely right now, and it's coherent.  Have fun!

I'm going to make these just a bit less tiny, and now probably worth actually reviewing.  This still shouldn't be done by hand, really #17478 would be better and these would be auto-generated by some dictionary giving info about each document, but this is an easy step in the right direction.

Hello !

Well, now the title does not begin with a dash but read "Sage documentation -- Sage documentation v6.5beta4". That's probably better anyway, since all you see in a browser tab is "Sage documentation" anyway `;-)`

Good to go !
