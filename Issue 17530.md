The only minor downside is that the order of Cythonization is random, no longer in the alphabetical order specified in `module_list.py`.

Thanks for looking at these!

The order is not random, it's (1) pyx files that were modified themselves, then (2) extensions that directly depend on modified files, then (3) everything else. This lets you catch errors early. Within each subgroup things are sorted alphabetically. (That should already be happening.)

Since this commit, `misc/darwin_utilities.pyx` (which should only be included on Darwin, see `module_list.py`) is included on all platforms (and, incidentally, fails on cygwin). Should it be moved to a directory of its own?

I concur with sebastien (who I guess also noticed some new modules should be linked to gmp)...
Maybe we could use the `skip_build` thingy from #18145 to solve the darwin thing.

This has indeed been solved by #18145 (see also #17961).

The missing links to gmp are in #17962.
