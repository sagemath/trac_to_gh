See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/7n5xtT9Dw2g

We add a method `element_ring` to `FreeModule` and `FreeModuleElement` indicating the ring from which the entries `v[i]` come. Example:

```
sage: M = (ZZ^2) * (1/2)
sage: v = M([0,1/2])
sage: v.base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: v.element_ring()
Rational Field
```

I noticed this in one of the commits:

```diff
- from sage.categories.all import FreeModules
- category = FreeModules(base_ring.category())
+ from sage.categories.all import Fields, FreeModules, VectorSpaces
+ if base_ring in Fields():
+    category = VectorSpaces(base_ring)
+ else:
+    category = FreeModules(base_ring)
```

It's important for performance and and memory-leaking that categories do *not* refer to their base rings. This information is already stored in the parent. Thus, the `FreeModules(base_ring.category())` is quite intentional. Please keep it in.

Furthermore:

```
sage: FreeModules(Fields())
Category of vector spaces with basis over fields
```

so the category code does the fields check already. No need to do it twice.

Nils, I agree that it's a mistake (probably by merging, since I didn't intentionally make that change).

But currently I'm waiting for #17584 to be reviewed before continuing with this ticket.

I'm also wondering whether I should wait or not for #10513: if I wait, then this ticket might never get finished.

Hi Jeroen,

Did you saw the weirdness in #13304 that I mentioned related to #11751? Could we get rid of the `.basis()` in the initialization of free module elements here?

No, but this ticket *does* fix one of the issues mentioned in #13304.
