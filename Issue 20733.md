A Linear Gabidulin Code Gab[n,k] over F_{q<sup>m</sup>} of length n <= m and dimension k <= n is the set of all words, formed by the operator evaluation of a q-degree restricted skew polynomial (with frobenius endomorphism and a finite field) f(x) \in S_{F_{q<sup>m</sup>}}[x].

i.e. Gab[n,k] = {(f(g_0), f(g_1),..., f(g_{n-1})) = f(g): deg(f) < k}

where g_0,...,g_{n-1} are fixed elements belonging to F_{q<sup>m</sup>} and are linearly independent over F_{q}

This ticket proposes a new class for Gabidulin Codes along with encoders and decoders for it.

A few points:
1. I've not added the tests and documentation for now since the code design is still in flux.
2. The file compiles successfully and one can create the code and codewords in vector form, i.e. F_{q<sup>m</sup>}<sup>n</sup>.
3. One problem right now is that, although the dual code and the parity check matrix that are constructed are correct (verified by trying G*H<sup>T</sup> = 0, as well as checking linear independence of h_0, h_1,..., h_{n-1}), I am using a random element from the right kernel of the coefficient matrix (Equation 2.28 of Antonia Wachter-Zeh's PhD thesis). And so dual of the dual code does not give me the original code. `solve_right` returns the trivial (all-zeros) solution. 
4. Should there be a `def generator_matrix` method within the code class itself?

Hello,

To answer your question (`4.`), for now, yes, I guess you need to have such a method.
Later on, when the abstract class to manage rank-metric codes will be implemented we can 
replicate the design used in `AbstractLinearCode`, but for now, copy-pasting `generator_matrix` 
from `AbstractLinearCode` and put it in `GabidulinCode` is fine. 

Some remarks:

1. You don't have to use backslashes to jump lines when you're in a parenthesis/square bracket block.
   For instance, you can write:

```
% (self.length(), self.dimension(), \
self.minimum_distance(), self.base_field())
```

 as

```
% (self.length(), self.dimension(),
self.minimum_distance(), self.base_field())
```


2. Lines 19-34 are more or less copy-pasted from `relative_finite_field_extension.py`, and are not necessary. Take lines 19-20 for instance: it's a carbon copy of lines 116-117 of `relative_finite_field_extension.py` (except you replaced `must be` by `has to be` in the error message)... Which basically means you run the same sanity check twice: first time on lines 19-20 and second time line 49 when calling the constructing a `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension`. I think you should just remove all those tests and let `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` do its job on sanitizing.

3. In the same vein: you copy-pasted a lot of getter from `relative_finite_field_extension.py`, and I'm not sure it makes sense. The user might be a bit puzzled by `absolute_field_power` which returns something of little relevance wrt. the Gabidulin code. Furthermore, if the user desperately needs to access this value, they can still access it by the `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` returned by `relative_finite_field_extension` (this one we should keep). 

4. There's some kind of naming conflict: `evaluation_points` and `linearly_independent_elements` are the same (see line 68), but while the user has to write `linearly_independent_elements=stuff` at construction time, they have to write `my_code.evaluation_points()` to access them from the constructed code. I think you should choose one name and stick to it. I vote for `evaluation_points` for consistency with `grs.py`.

5. Remember to not call methods in for loops except it's absolutely necessary. You do this on lines 96-97, 180-184 and 212. E.g. line 182, as return value of `p.coefficients()` never changes throughout the iterations, I would store it in a local variable and use this local variable instead.

Otherwise it seems good.

Best,

David

Also, avoid "log" if you can:

- `s = log(q,p)` should be `s = relative_field.degree()`. Similar with `sm`.
- `m` should be `sm / m`. Check if the division goes well.

Hi Arpit,

Just saw your Gao decoder, and I have a few initial comments:

- `r_` (perhaps `R` is a better name) is an interpolation polynomial: construct it using your new `interpolation_polynomial` method instead of what you're manually doing right now (which is much slower).

- After you have performed the division and checked that `rem` is zero (use `if rem.is_zero()`), then you need to check that `quo` indeed corresponds to the message of a codeword close to `r`. See how the Gao decoder for Reed-Solomon codes does this with a helper function, covering both `decode_to_message` and `decode_to_codeword` in an efficient way.

- You `_partial_xgcd` would be more readable in a compact form, IMO. Say you call `r_current -> r_c` and `r_previous -> r_p`, then you can replace the loop body with:

   {{{
       (quo, r_c), r_p = r_c.right_quo_rem(r_p), r_c
       u_c, u_p = u_p - q*u_c, u_c
       v_c, v_p = v_p - q*v_c, v_c
   }}}

Best,
Johan

I'm also pretty sure it "just works". But it will have terrible performance in the Euclidean algorithm because of unmitigated coefficient growth.

OK for not supporting infinite fields for now. (And I agree that there are issues with growing of coefficients. By the way, do you know if there exists an analogue of subresultants for skew polynomials?)

To answer your last question:


```
sage: q = 5^2
sage: k.<a> = GF(q^2)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism(2)
sage: Frob.fixed_field()
(Finite Field in a_fixed of size 5^2, Ring morphism:

I've looked through the code in overview, and it looks good! Some comments on the structure:

- Constructor of Gabidulin code: you require both `subfield` and twist map. I've thought a bit more about it, and I think that the `subfield` should always be the fixed field of the twist map: if it is smaller than the fixed field, then the code is not MRD, and if it is larger, then the code is not linear.

If `subfield` is given but twist map is not, then default to Frobenius of that field extension. If both twist map and `subfield` is set, then throw an exception if the twist map has a method `fixed_field` and it does not return the given `subfield`.

- You don't have an example using `field_extension`.

- Your `parity_check_matrix` is strange. Why not simply `return self.dual_code().generator_matrix()`?

- What's the point of `_vector_space` and `def vector_space`?

- You shouldn't override `generator_matrix` and `random_element`.

- What's the point of `GabidulinCode.message_space`?

- Doc: There's no such thing a as a q-degree of a skew polynomial. The doc
  should mention that over finite fields, the skew polynomials are very similar
  to linearized polynomials (isomorphic when the twist map is power-by-q).

> There are two issues that remain. One is `def parity_evaluation_points` where the problem is to find a concrete, non-trivial solution for the equation `Ax = 0` where `A` is the coefficient matrix. I am not sure how to do that in Sage.

Just proceed exactly as you have done, until you get `solution_space`. Then a non-zero element is `solution_space.basis()[0]`, assuming that `solution_space` is not empty.

That should be a method on `AbstractLinearRankMetricCode`. It could be called `field_extension_degree`.

Replying to [comment:28 arpitdm]:
> What do I do if both `subfield` and `twist_map` are not given?

Then take `twist_map` to be absolute frobenius, i.e. frobenius wrt. the prime field, and `subfield` to be the prime field.

> Also, should I remove the dependency on #21088?

Oh, yeah I guess you can, since finite fields are already formally supported without #21088.

I've just realised that since #24170, `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` is no longer necessary and is available in the much nicer interface `F.vector_space()`.

Indeed, #24279 is in review and removes the `RelativeFiniteFieldExtension` from `sage.coding`.
