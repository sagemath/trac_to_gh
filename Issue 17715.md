# Issue 17715: Actually remove c_lib files

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17952

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-03-13 21:25:44

Since many tickets of #17854 have been fixed, we can now finally remove almost all of `c_lib`. Only `interrupt`, `ntl_wrap` and `cc_object` (the latter is just a header file) remain.
