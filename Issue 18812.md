- reduce the number of iterations of the test `for i in range(100): # long time`. 10 is enough.
- replace reference [CCL12] with [CCL15]: N. Cohen, D. Coudert, A. Lancin. On computing the Gromov hyperbolicity. ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics, 20(1.6):1-18, 2015. [`<http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2780652>`_] or [`<https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01182890>`_]
- I think it is better to write `for b in range(D-1,-1,-1):` than `for b from D > b >= 0:` although the later is easier to read. see http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/language_basics.html#integer-for-loops
- Instead of `c = a`, `a = b` and `b = c` you can write directly `a,b = b,a`
- When you `# We reset acc_bool`, it might be easier to use `memset`. This part has negligeable impact on the computation time anyway.

Hello!

Replying to [comment:4 dcoudert]:

Done!

Done! I used the first link.

Done!

Done!

Not done! In my opinion, it has impact on the computation time. Indeed, when we fix a pair (a,b), the algorithm does the following:


```
for c in decreasing order of ecc(c)-d(a,c):
    if ecc(c)-d(a,c) >= 3*(h+1)-2*d(a,b):
        ... other tests to check if v is acceptable and/or valuable
    else:
        break # All other vertices c are not acceptable and not valuable

for c in valuable:
    for (c,d) pair before (a,b), with d acceptable:
        h = max(h, delta(a,b,c,d))

for c in acceptable:
    acc_bool[c] = 0

```

Here, the first for loop is performed as many times as the number of vertices satisfying `ecc(c)-d(a,c) >= 3*(h+1)-2*d(a,b)` (let's say, 100, if the graph has with 10000 vertices). The second for loop needs time O(acceptable * valuable), where acceptable is, let's say, 10, and valuable is 5. The total time is 50.

The last loop takes time 10, as it is, while it takes time 10000 if we use memset (I know memset is very fast, but here we are talking about two orders of magnitude).

Did I convince you?

This is weird. I have tried both on a 64bits and a 32 bits computer all the graphs for which we have the list of edges and my computers reports no error. 
I cannot reproduce the failing example with BA graphs, but a long test on the ticket is successful on my computer.
I have no clue where the problem may comes from :(
