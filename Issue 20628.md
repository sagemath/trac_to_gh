CC:  mmadeu

The code in #812 added the new functionalit to sage that permits to use Pollack-Steven's method to compute p-adic L-function of elliptic curves and more general modular forms.

However the code is far from optimal and is currently very slow.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20865
