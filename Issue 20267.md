Regarding

```
print("Sage requires Python 2.5 or newer", file=sys.stderr)
```


I'm pretty sure that Sage requires Python 2.7. But honestly, I would just remove that check, I don't see the point of it.

Another point: if you're making changes to the division anyway, you might as well use `//` and add `from __future__ import division`.

+1, I am fairly sure that when we upgraded to python 2.7 in sage 5.0 a few changes where incompatible with earlier python, and it just pilled on from there.

hmm. It seems that importing `print_function` here gives us a lot of places where print must be corrected. Maybe this should be undone and redone in another ticket ?

Is comment:5 similar to why you did not add `from __future__ import division`?

I have not tried, but I would say yes. Probably inserting any future import here would trigger it for all files. This will be good, once all tests pass, to keep things ok by
just inserting one import here.
