    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: for polyhedra with floating point numbers, the only allowed ring is RDF with backend 'cdd'
```


should be replaced by "ValueError: the only allowed inexact ring is RDF with backend 'cdd'"

Wouldn't it be good, if it automatically detected `AA`? (Perhaps not..)


```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[sqrt(2)]], base_ring=AA)
sage: P.vertices()

I don't want to special case input coming from the symbolic ring in the polyhedron code. This is the kind of thing that would have to be repeated everywhere. So either `sqrt(2)` should be a proper number field element (possibly AA) or this will stay as it is.

Forcing the base ring to be algebraic numbers is a bit "DWIM"... so I would allow it as it is above. If the user is lazy and still puts the base ring to be `AA` with square roots everywhere... it's still nice to be able to get what you want, but it should not allow to simply but symbolic stuff at all.
