This is not a good fix. All of these packages should be modified (with proper upstreamable patches) so that they look for upstream's official new header name `cddlib/cdd.h` in the normal user-provided include path.

I think I got it figured out for latte now: https://github.com/latte-int/latte/pull/23

There is a couple of scenarios that could happen:

- System cdd in:
  - inclusion directory
  - `cdd/`
  - `cddlib'`
- Sages cdd in:
  - inclusion directory (of sage)
  - `cddlib/` (once cdd is upgraded)
