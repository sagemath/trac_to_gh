```
Some functionality can be provided by
either one of two SPKGs.

For such pairs (A, B) of SPKGs, configuring with

```
./configure --without-system-A --without-system-B
```
or equivalently

```
./configure --with-system-A=no --with-system-B=no
```
can result in both A and B being built.

Some cases are solved after the removal
of one of the spkgs in the pair.

- `gmp` vs `mpir`: remove `mpir` #32549, #32727
- `atlas` vs `openblas`; remove `atlas` #30350
- full `boost` vs `boost_cropped`; remove full #31575;
  m4 files use cropped #31871

Remaining cases:

- gfortran can be provided by the `gcc` or `gfortran` SPKGs
- some database packages have `SPKG` vs `SPKG_small` pairs

**gfortran**

Both `gcc` and `gfortran` built after

```
./configure --with-system-gcc=no --with-system-gfortran=no`
```

- [sage-devel report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/YyB2zk2Lbtg/4YTwKlMJAgAJ)

**SPKG_small**

```
  --with-system-pari_seadata={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system pari_seadata
  --with-system-pari_seadata_small={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system pari_seadata_small
```

Overall, we need a better solution for such pairs of packages.

The only reason that comes to mind is that at least one package uses an mpir-specific interface: #30325.

For Sage 9.3, I would be reluctant to remove MPIR completely. But it would be good to remove this trap in our configure script.

Reworded ticket description (removing some bits
reproduced below) after

- ATLAS removed in #30350.
- MPIR removed in #32549 and #32727.
- work on boost and boost-cropped:
  - #31871: replace boost by boost_cropped in m4 files
  - #31575: Remove full boost package
  - #31250: Upgrade: boost_cropped 1.78.0

For gmp/mpir, we have:

```
  --with-system-gmp={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system gmp
  --with-system-mpir={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system mpir
  --with-mp=system        use the system GMP as multiprecision library, if
                          possible (default)
  --with-mp=mpir          use the Sage SPKG for MPIR as multiprecision library
  --with-mp=gmp           use the Sage SPKG for GMP as multiprecision library
```
The first two are automatically generated and do not work properly. The `--with-mp` option is legacy and works properly but does not fit well with the systematic naming scheme. Removing `mpir` in #32549 removes this case.

Same for BLAS (as reported most recently in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/pqnhfUJYS-Q/m/lOQJ3EtYBwAJ):

```
  --with-system-atlas={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system atlas
  --with-system-openblas={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system openblas
  --with-blas=openblas    use OpenBLAS as BLAS library (default)
    --with-blas=atlas       use ATLAS as BLAS library
``` 
Removing `atlas` in #30350 removes this case.

And to a lesser degree for these ones:

```
  --with-system-boost={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system boost
  --with-system-boost_cropped={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system boost_cropped
```
