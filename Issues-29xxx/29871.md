Keywords: mixed_forms, manifolds

At this stage, the not equal comparison fails:

```
sage: M = Manifold(4, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y,z,t> = M.chart()
sage: Form0 = M.mixed_form(comp=([0,0,0,0,0]))
sage: Form1 = M.mixed_form(comp=([1,0,0,0,0]))
sage: Form0 != Form1
False
```

(reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52409/why-doesnt-or-work-for-mixed-forms/)

I already spotted the error: originally, `richcmp` is checked separately on each component and returns `False` if the check fails for at least one element. But for the inequality, it is enough when the check succeeds for at least one element because then both mixed forms are already unequal.

This bug gets fixed in this ticket. Furthermore, an equality check between mixed forms and differential forms will be possible.

This sounds like a good idea, except maybe when efficiency matters, like for `ManifoldPoint`, since points are parameters of `UniqueRepresentation` objects, namely tangent spaces.
