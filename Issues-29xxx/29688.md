I'm not entirely happy about raising a `NotImplementedError` in the unsigned case, but I couldn't think of anything better. `ValueError` and `SignError` don't work, because the `BuiltinFunction` `sign` doesn't take either of those as the final word, and tries other ways to calculate the value, which results in an error message that is confusing.
