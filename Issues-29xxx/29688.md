How would you make a ring with signed finite numbers ?

By definition [InfinityRing](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/infinity.html) consists of five elements; all their signs are known, but apparently the `sign` function does not know them all.

I think this PR solves the problem.

```
sage: sign(InfinityRing(3))
1
sage: sign(InfinityRing(0))
0
sage: sign(InfinityRing(-3))
-1
sage: sign(UnsignedInfinityRing(3))
...
NotImplementedError: sign of number < oo is not well defined
```
I'm not entirely happy about raising a `NotImplementedError` in the unsigned case, but I couldn't think of anything better. `ValueError` and `SignError` don't work, because the `BuiltinFunction` `sign` doesn't take either of those as the final word, and tries other ways to calculate the value, which results in an error message that is confusing.
