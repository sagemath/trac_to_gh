The ci-cygwin*.yml files right now are the result of copy+paste. It should really be generated. 

  (a) A simple macro language should do. m4 can do the job. Or write the generator in bash or python. 

  (b) Extra credit for automating the splitting into nodes and stages from package dependencies and compilation time data. This is a stochastic scheduling problem with precedence constraints.

3. (from #29929)

python detection - see #30177
Use tar --ignore-failed-read to work around trouble on cygwin (​[#25993 comment:107](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25993#comment:107))
