```
sage: vector([-1, 0, 2, 0]).length()  # should be 2
4
```

According to the documentation of `length` from `modules_with_basis.py`:

```
Return the number of basis elements whose coefficients in "self" are nonzero.
```

This is solved by overwriting `length` in `FreeModuleElement`.


Depends on #34509

The method is also broken for matrices:

```
sage: matrix(QQ, 4).length()
...
TypeError: object of type 'sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense' has no len()
```
This would be useful for sparse matrices in particular.

What would you suggest to do with matrices then? Should it return the number of rows?

Given that the method does not currently work for matrices, it would not break anything if we make it return the length of the support, except that it is inconsistent with vectors.

Still broken in 9.7.rc1. This must be some strange Cython-related effect:
