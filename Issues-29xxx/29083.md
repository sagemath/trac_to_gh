This ticket is creating a lot of churn in the revision history of files, but the benefit of the change is not argued. Is it really the case that functions in classes should have their first argument named "self"? It's indeed the case that on instances, these functions will be wrapped in bound methods that have their first argument as "self", but that doesn't necessarily say that the intent of the routine is best expressed by naming that parameter "self".

It may well be the case that the unbound functions do get called as well, in which case there isn't an obvious "self".

For instance, if you look in `sage/structure/element.pyx`, you can find plenty of routines that quite consistently name their arguments "left" and "right" (for coercion operations). In the style of `__rmul__`, it could well be that those arguments are swapped in order!

It could well be that the changes in this ticket have taken into account the subtleties that can arise and has only changed cases that benefit from using "self", but currently no such argument is made, which makes it look like the commit just blindly enforces "first argument of a method must be named self".

Please clarify in what way this commit improves the code base.

As pep8 explains, these are *guidelines* not *rules*. It may be that the instances that this commit changes arose from uninformed copying of using "not self" in other places, in which case changing them might make sense.

But I know that at least in the coercion framework, there are places where using "left" and "right" was done very consciously to emphasize that the order of the arguments might NOT have a "self" first and/or because the code expressed intent better with more semantic naming.

In a method that doesn't change attributes on "self", it can be pretty irrelevant if the first argument is the instance the wrapper through which the function is called is bound to.

As PEP8 points out: "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". I think there is a real possibility that (some of) the instances changed in the commit here are intentionally deviating from the general quideline. Perhaps putting a comment with them "first argument named "left" for a reason" helps future PEP-8 fervour.

(spacing etc. is less controversial in my mind, but if you're changing names in code, you're actually messing with the expression of semantics the original author put there. You want to make sure that you're informed about such those before making a decision. That probably means it's not worth PEP8-ing this stuff).

**EDIT:** Looking at some of the examples, I think changing to "self" does make sense in some cases, but then the naming of the other variables would need to be balanced too: "left/right" should be changed to "self/other" to have a balanced naming scheme. It's actually helpful in that code to have a correspondence between the naming of the two parameters. Similarly, the example of "I/J" can be changed to "self/other", but "self/J" is actually less clear in my opinion, because the similarity between the parameters is lost. There may be cases there where "left/right" really is better! I can't tell.
