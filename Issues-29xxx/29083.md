Let's just tag it `# optional - twisted`. I don't see a need to keep `twisted` standard just cause of this.

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.

Are there other dependencies to be removed from being standard? like babel ?
