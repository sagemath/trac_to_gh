Currently, Hyperplane arrangements only use the default backends for related polyhedral objects.

We should make it possible to use backends. For example:

```
sage: K.<q> = CyclotomicField(9)
sage: L.<r9> = NumberField((q+q^(-1)).minpoly(),embedding = AA(q+q^-1))
sage: norms = [[1,1/3*(-2*r9^2-r9+1),0],[1,-r9^2-r9,0],
               [1,-r9^2+1,0],[1,-r9^2,0],[1,r9^2-4,-r9^2+3]]
sage: H.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(L)
sage: A = H(backend='normaliz')
sage: for v in norms:
....:      a,b,c = v
....:     A = A.add_hyperplane(a*x + b*y + c*z)
sage: R = A.regions()               # optional - pynormaliz
sage: R[0].backend()                # optional - pynormaliz
'normaliz'
```

This is just a first version to make it work with regions.

Probably, one should think about whether it is desirable to have an underlying backend when one deals with an hyperplane arrangement... Because it is annoying to add it as an option in each method...

Not everything you would do with a hyperplane arrangement requires the polyhedron code. So I am a little more inclined to keep it being an option to each method than something passed to the consturction. The other option I think could be good is implement a global option to hyperplane arrangements for a default polyhedron backend.

One issue discussed with gh-kliem is the case that one has two methods that use stored polyhedra, but then the desired backend is not the one of the precomputed data.

Yes, this sounds reasonable, simply have an option that specifies the wished backend to do the polyhedral computation. This makes sense to me. I'm starting to make these changes.

Less important, but because I saw it when you changed the line: There is also a global instance of `Fields()` nailed in memory under the name `_Fields` (see `rings/ring.pyx`; although this seems to be done in multiple places...), so I would import that and do

```diff
-        if base_ring not in Fields:
+        if base_ring not in _Fields:
```
because it is a faster check.
