Thank you. Note that there are some changes like this, in addition to removing the SAGE_LOCAL check:

```diff
 sdh_pip_install .
-
-if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
-    exit 1
-fi
-
```
I did not carefully search for these, but if I saw them and was touching that file anyway, I cleaned it up. There are probably more instances of this, but the whole thing was enough of a patch bomb that I didn't want to make it worse.
