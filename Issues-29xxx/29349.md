I think it's much better to make "-j" an option for users. It is already advertised in the top-level README.md file and also in the Sage installation guide:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#step-by-step-installation-procedure
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#environment-variables

Note also that if someone is using a shared machine, it may not be appropriate for them to use all of the machine's available processing power. Finally, `nproc` is not available on OS X. I don't know how widely it is available or what other options there are. The script `src/bin/sage-num-threads.py` is a cross-platform replacement.
