As `@`gh-zlscherr reports in #31326, upgrading to gcc 9.3 does NOT fix the issues on macOS Big Sur.

homebrew:
- uses this patch for GCC 10.2: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/formula-patches/6a83f36d/gcc/bigsur_2.patch
- notes in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/gcc.rb#L53: "Patch for Big Sur, remove with GCC 10.3 - https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=98805"

Not sure if anyone has a backport to the GCC 9.x series

I had thought that staying for a while on the GCC 9.x series would be useful - given how many fixes were necessary in packages for the 10.x series, there may still be optional/experimental/user packages that cannot be built with GCC 10.

But it looks like this is not going anywhere, so let's move on and continue in #29703 with an upgrade to 10.x
