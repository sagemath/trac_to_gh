<a id='comment:29'></a>I guess it is `≤` somewhere in the text.

```
1005	Chapter 45.
1006	! Missing $ inserted.
1007	<inserted text> 
1008	                $
1009	l.1955 ≤
1010	          6.
1011	?
1012	! Emergency stop.
1013	<inserted text> 
1014	                $
1015	l.1955 ≤
1016	          6.
```

This one?

```
$ grep -R "≤" src/doc/
src/doc/en/reference/spkg/database_jones_numfield.rst:≤6.
```

So one would need to modify this package, don't know how.
