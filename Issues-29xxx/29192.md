```markdown
At present, when using [interact](https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact) with three.js plots in the Jupyter notebook, the camera gets reset to its default position each time the plot is regenerated. If the default camera position isn't ideal for whatever is being plotted, it's cumbersome to have to re-adjust the camera after every change.

This MR adds a boolean `persist` viewing option for three.js that will persist the camera state between viewings of the plot using local storage. In a Jupyter notebook, it's keyed off of the current notebook and cell; otherwise the URL. It defaults to `False` so as not to interfere with the existing behavior that users may rely upon.

Without persist, if you don't like where you've moved the camera to, it's easy enough to reload the page or regenerate the plot to get back to the default. With persist, however, that becomes more difficult; so this MR also adds a "Reset Camera" feature to the bottom-right pop-up menu . (+ some minor hover highlighting and cursor fixes to the menu)

Hi Paul!

Yes, a `viewpoint` option does seem like it would solve the use case I mentioned (keeping a fixed camera with `interact`). 

Another reason I implemented this feature is because I've been experimenting with adding support for three.js-based animation to Sage: discrete keyframes like the existing `animate` function at present, with the goal of adding some interpolation or image morphing between the frames later on. I'd like to be able to persist the playback state of the animation as well, preferably tied to the same `persist` option.

Laying the foundation with a persistent camera first seemed the way to go. With the animation state changing on its own every frame, a manual approach similar to `viewpoint` would be more cumbersome.

I'm open to scrapping persistence for the camera and re-introducing it for the animation. Of course, that presumes that the animation stuff gets accepted later on; there may be better alternatives that I'm unaware of. Or perhaps a hybrid approach: if a `viewpoint` has been provided, then ignore `persist` as regards the initial camera state?

Thanks for taking a look at this. :)

I don't speed a lot of time in the Jupyter notebook, preferring the console, except recently in order to use `interact`, so I wasn't sure what the commons workflows in it might be and whether this change could interfere with them. So, I opted for the cautious route.

Joshua, just took a look at your animation branch on [GitLab](GitLab). Looks like you're deep into it! Are there any active examples online? And don't forget that Three.js has an animation system already, which you don't appear to be using.

Although keyframes are one way to approach the topic, keep in mind that we can manipulate data directly using JavaScript. We haven't yet added a basic spin animation, but that's easily done by updating the rotation parameters of the object.

For more complex alterations, we could pass in a function describing the locations of all vertices over time. Lots of possibilities without thinking in terms of saving a movie frame by frame.

Please also try not to add anything to the viewer that will be dependent on a given environment, in this case a Jupyter notebook. I'd rather the viewer be as portable as possible.

Paul, I gathered the examples I've put in my documentation so far and thrown them up on [GitHub](GitHub) pages: 

[https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/](https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/)

I opted not to use Three.js's animation system since I wanted to support multiple "times", one per variable being animated. Three.js would allow me to use multiple mixers to blend linearly between several sets of keyframes, but that wouldn't be appropriate for plotting a function f(x,y,...) that's not some linear combination c1*f1(x)+c2*f2(y)+...

Agreed that keyframes aren't necessarily the best approach, but it has two enourmous benefits:

1. It was quite easy to work into the existing Graphics3d system. No need to, for example, go into the implicit_plot3d code and modify the algorithm (marching cubes I think) to produce a mesh suitable for morphing. Nor worrying about topological changes like holes forming or components pinching off. I love math, but I'm a software developer, not a mathematician!

2. It's very general: it can animate a rigidbody moving along a trajectory up to a vector field representing fluid flow with the same amount of code on both the back- and front-ends.

Perhaps I should create a new ticket for the animation to continue the conversation there? I'll hold off on the persistence stuff then if it's not desired.

Thanks!

Joshua, here at long last is the `viewpoint` option we discussed above. Use the 'Get Viewpoint' menu option to obtain the value that is passed as a string in the graphic object.

Hi Paul, I've verified that setting the `viewpoint` option to a string containing the output of *Get Viewpoint* correctly re-creates that camera orientation in the new plot.

I'm wary of passing structured data like this as a string parameter, though. It works fine for the *Get Viewpoint* use case, but one may imagine wanting to set the viewpoint to a specific axis-angle or have the axis-angle computed in some way. In the former case a typo (like forgetting a comma) would produce a blank plot instead of a syntax error, and in the latter case you'd have to take the extra step of building up a string.

As *Get Viewpoint* is currently implemented, we have to surround its output with something to avoid a syntax error, but why not parentheses instead of quotes? `([x,y,z],angle)` opposed to `"[x,y,z],angle"`. That way Python can validate the syntax, and we can validate the types/contents.

While testing, I forgot to surround the output with quotes a... non-zero... number of times. Ideally, and I apologize for not thinking of this when reviewing the code that introduced it, *Get Viewpoint* would do the surrounding for us to avoid this perhaps not uncommon occurrence among some subset of users ;)

Also, do we want the zoom / camera distance to be included as well? Perhaps by letting the length of the axis vector represent the zoom/distance?

Many thanks!

One very minor note: the documentation still states "string of the form...". Otherwise looks good and can give positive review.
