```markdown
At present, when using [interact](https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact) with three.js plots in the Jupyter notebook, the camera gets reset to its default position each time the plot is regenerated. If the default camera position isn't ideal for whatever is being plotted, it's cumbersome to have to re-adjust the camera after every change.

This MR adds a boolean `persist` viewing option for three.js that will persist the camera state between viewings of the plot using local storage. In a Jupyter notebook, it's keyed off of the current notebook and cell; otherwise the URL. It defaults to `False` so as not to interfere with the existing behavior that users may rely upon.

Without persist, if you don't like where you've moved the camera to, it's easy enough to reload the page or regenerate the plot to get back to the default. With persist, however, that becomes more difficult; so this MR also adds a "Reset Camera" feature to the bottom-right pop-up menu . (+ some minor hover highlighting and cursor fixes to the menu)

Hi Paul!

Yes, a `viewpoint` option does seem like it would solve the use case I mentioned (keeping a fixed camera with `interact`). 

Another reason I implemented this feature is because I've been experimenting with adding support for three.js-based animation to Sage: discrete keyframes like the existing `animate` function at present, with the goal of adding some interpolation or image morphing between the frames later on. I'd like to be able to persist the playback state of the animation as well, preferably tied to the same `persist` option.

Laying the foundation with a persistent camera first seemed the way to go. With the animation state changing on its own every frame, a manual approach similar to `viewpoint` would be more cumbersome.

I'm open to scrapping persistence for the camera and re-introducing it for the animation. Of course, that presumes that the animation stuff gets accepted later on; there may be better alternatives that I'm unaware of. Or perhaps a hybrid approach: if a `viewpoint` has been provided, then ignore `persist` as regards the initial camera state?

Thanks for taking a look at this. :)

I don't speed a lot of time in the Jupyter notebook, preferring the console, except recently in order to use `interact`, so I wasn't sure what the commons workflows in it might be and whether this change could interfere with them. So, I opted for the cautious route.

Paul, I gathered the examples I've put in my documentation so far and thrown them up on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) pages: 

[https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/](https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/)

I opted not to use Three.js's animation system since I wanted to support multiple "times", one per variable being animated. Three.js would allow me to use multiple mixers to blend linearly between several sets of keyframes, but that wouldn't be appropriate for plotting a function f(x,y,...) that's not some linear combination c1*f1(x)+c2*f2(y)+...

Agreed that keyframes aren't necessarily the best approach, but it has two enourmous benefits:

1. It was quite easy to work into the existing Graphics3d system. No need to, for example, go into the implicit_plot3d code and modify the algorithm (marching cubes I think) to produce a mesh suitable for morphing. Nor worrying about topological changes like holes forming or components pinching off. I love math, but I'm a software developer, not a mathematician! So that kind of stuff is beyond my paygrade. :) Instead, I just plot the keyframes, sum them all up into a single Graphics3d object, attach some metadata as to when each object should be visible, and voila!: animation.

2. It's very general: it can animate a rigidbody moving along a trajectory up to a vector field representing fluid flow with the same amount of code on both the back- and front-ends.

Perhaps I should create a new ticket for the animation to continue the conversation there? I'll hold off on the persistence stuff then if it's not desired.

Thanks!

Hi Paul, I've verified that setting the `viewpoint` option to a string containing the output of *Get Viewpoint* correctly re-creates that camera orientation in the new plot.

I'm wary of passing structured data like this as a string parameter, though. It works fine for the *Get Viewpoint* use case, but one may imagine wanting to set the viewpoint to a specific axis-angle or have the axis-angle computed in some way. In the former case a typo (like forgetting a comma) would produce a blank plot instead of a syntax error, and in the latter case you'd have to take the extra step of building up a string.

As *Get Viewpoint* is currently implemented, we have to surround its output with something to avoid a syntax error, but why not parentheses instead of quotes? `([x,y,z],angle)` opposed to `"[x,y,z],angle"`. That way Python can validate the syntax, and we can validate the types/contents.

While testing, I forgot to surround the output with quotes a... non-zero... number of times. Ideally, and I apologize for not thinking of this when reviewing the code that introduced it, *Get Viewpoint* would do the surrounding for us to avoid this perhaps not uncommon occurrence among some subset of users ;)

Also, do we want the zoom / camera distance to be included as well? Perhaps by letting the length of the axis vector represent the zoom/distance?

Many thanks!

I checked that the viewpoint is still set correctly, that lists/tuples are both supported, and that a helpful warning message is displayed if the `viewpoint` option is not of the correct form.

One very minor note: the documentation still states "string of the form...". Otherwise looks good and can give positive review.

Thank you for adding this option. Will make using `interact` in notebooks with three.js plots much more convenient.
