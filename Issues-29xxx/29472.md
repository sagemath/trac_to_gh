```
As we allow sage to use a system pari from version 2.11.1 we modify the doctests such that they pass with both pari versions.

All of those failures are due to different choices of representation or to small differences in precision.

Currently, there are failing doctests in debian-sid [https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/560405581](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/560405581), which is (correctly) not fixed by #29445 (debian sid uses pari (2.11.4~pre1-1), which contains no serious bug that we are aware of).

Follow up: #29313.

I'm surprised this works:

TESTS:

We test the above doctest. The representation depends on the PARI version::

    sage: [x] = [K.uniformizer(P) for P,e in factor(K.ideal(7))]
    sage: x in (t^2 + 3*t +1, t^2 - 4*t +1)
    True
```

I thought that `::` cleared the global `K`. In any case, I would recommend reconstructing `K` here so that the test doesn't break if someone adds another example to the end of the `EXAMPLES:` block above it (and likewise for the other "test the above doctest" tests).

I do this in many places, as in 

```

A polyhedron::

    sage: P = polytopes.cube()

The f-vector::

    sage: P.f_vector()
    (1, 8, 12, 6, 1)
```

However, this can be really annoying when you have tests in the test section that rely on stuff way above. So I changed it. It is also easier to read the tests in that way.

No such decision has been made.
I think you should make a decision which versions to support based on your knowledge about the details of these doctests.

ubuntu eoan has pari 2.11.2-2 and this seems to work perfectly fine with our doctests.

[https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/560405517](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/560405517)

The doctests in this ticket are all about representation, I have to admit that I trusted our code in some ways:

- I haven't looked all the way into `optimized_representation`, but both choices seem fine to me,
- `/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py`, `S.S_class_group([])`: from the documentation I understand that any `QQ`-base exchange is fine
- for the global integral model I'm completely relying on `is_global_integral_model`

So for our doctests pari 2.11.2 or patched pari 2.11.3 work fine (or pari 2.11.4 beta). There are probably other bugs, but I have no clue.

Since it only takes two people to make a change, and since there are two antipodal views on which changes should be made, it would be good to come to an agreement even if we have to vote on it on sage-devel. I'm de-motivated to work on this stuff when it's just Matthias and I who want to do opposite things, but I would suck it up if the consensus is against me.

The question is, essentially: should we have/add doctests for upstream bugs in/to the sage library?

If yes, we tend to force the latest (and possibly patched) versions of sage's dependencies, because every new version of a dependency likely fixes *some* math bug that we can add a doctest for. The upside is that we can ensure that users who download and build sage themselves (even if they have to build a bunch of custom SPKGs) get a known quantity.

If no, then we can accept slightly older system packages and sage's test suite will still pass. This saves a lot of time while building sage, but can delay bugfixes until distributions ship them or upgrade their packages. In other words, system dependencies are the responsibility of packagers, but if you don't like that you can use the SPKG instead.

Case in point: this equivalence I posted on #29494 should be symmetric, but isn't.

```
sage: M1 = matrix(ZZ,[[16,6],[6,10]])
sage: M2 = matrix(ZZ,[[4,3],[3,10]])
sage: Q1 = QuadraticForm(M1)
sage: Q2 = QuadraticForm(M2)
sage: Q1.is_globally_equivalent_to(Q2)
False
sage: Q2.is_globally_equivalent_to(Q1)
True
```

That bug was fixed in pari-2.11.3. The first view says we should add a doctest for that, and thereafter bump the minimum required version of pari to the latest (patched) 2.11.3. The second view says that the bug is fixed upstream and isn't going to come back, so we don't need to test it in sagelib, and it's OK if users who have installed pari-2.11.2 on their system experience the bug until they upgrade (i.e. we should still let them use 2.11.2 if that's what they have).

This ticket is only relevant in that it emphasizes how doctests are a side-channel for introducing version constraints.

As it is, the ticket still appears to be working.

Mathematically our own doctests are correct with pari 2.11.2 and pari 2.11.4 and this ticket merely acknowledges this.

I think this ticket is still valuable, because now we can update pari to 2.11.4 without having to modify the doctests (and therefore leading to annoying failures with older versions). So the decision to update pari and to reject older version is then independent.
