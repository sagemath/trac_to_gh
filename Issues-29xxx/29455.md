The `incidence_matrix` method of a 0-dimensional `CombinatorialPolyhedron` returns an error:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[0]]); P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: C = P.combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: C.incidence_matrix()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-dab311ba238f> in <module>()
----> 1 C.incidence_matrix()
...
ValueError: ``output_dimension`` must be the dimension of proper faces
```

We fix this and make the `0`-dimensional case consistent with `Polyhedron_base`.

Also we make `incidence_matrix` a `chached_method`.
