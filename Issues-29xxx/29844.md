Currently, Sage does not offer support for any Berkovich space. 

This ticket works towards getting a basic implementation of Berkovich space over `Cp` into Sage. As a special case of the general Berkovich construction, this seems feasible. However, as support for extensions of the padics is limited, the points of Berkovich space over `Cp` that can be represented will be limited. The aim is have an implementation which can easily be made to handle more general extensions of the padics, if/when they are implemented.

This branch is automatically build for binder. To experiment with the changes introduced here, go to https://gitlab-hooks-flau3jeaza-ew.a.run.app/ and replace `master` with what it says above in the `Branch` field.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Here are a few more comments:

- Giving two different error types for basically the same issue

```
R.<s,t>=Qp(3)[]
A= Berkovich_Cp_Affine(Qp(3))
A1=AffineSpace(Qp(3),1)
Q=A1(Qp(3)(5))

A(t,1) #TypeError
A(1,t) #ValueError
```

- why doesn't this make a type IV

```
f(x) = 1/x
g(x) = 1+1/x
A(f,g)
```

- extra space in error message: 

```
ValueError: Sequence of disks does not define a Type IV point as                                 containment is not proper
```


- Seems like this differing type might cause a problem somewhere:

```
A(Zp(3)(2),2).center().parent(), A(Qp(3)(2),2).center().parent()
```

Although I guess the same thing happens here:

```
k = Qp(5)
R.<x> = k[]
l.<w> = k.extension(x^7-5); l
A=Berkovich_Cp_Affine(k)
A(w,power=1).center().parent()
```
Perhaps this is unavoidable until we get Qpbar

- Is this actually right? Doesn't seem like it contains Q2.

```
Q1=A(2,1/3)
Q2=A(9,1/5)
Q1.join(Q2)
Type II point centered at 2 + O(5^20) of radius 5^0
```

- remove

```
_field_center()
```


- In the documentation: The spherical kernel of `self` with `other`.

don't use `self` here. Say `this point` or something like that.



- should describe what the partial order is in the documentation

same with potential kernel, Hsia kernel, etc.

Fixed, these now throw the same type of error

For Type 4 points, the sequence of disks must be decreasing with respect to containment. I added a check for containment, so this now throws an error (as it can't possibly be a Type 4 point)

> - extra space in error message

Fixed.

> Perhaps this is unavoidable until we get Qpbar

For extensions, it is. I changed the check so that the parent is a field, unless it is
an extension of Qp.

> - Is this actually right? Doesn't seem like it contains Q2.

It is

```
Q3 = Q1.join(Q2)
(Q2.center() - Q3.center()).abs()
1
```

So we can recenter to 9 and then containment is immediate.

Done!

> don't use `self` here. Say `this point` or something like that.

Done!

> 
> same with potential kernel, Hsia kernel, etc.

Added descriptions to some functions. The ones I don't understand will have to wait until I talk to Paul.

Here is what I found in a code review. I haven't tried the functionality testing yet. I'll do that after the code is stable.

```
DynamicalSystem_Berkovich in generic_ds/py should not be in this ticket

berkovich_space.py

I'd suggest giving a reference for berkspace.

all examples need ", space" in points. i.e., B(2,9) --> B(2, 9)

INPUT, OUTPUT lines should end with period

"child" as affine or projective seems like a weird variable name

------------------

line 99: documentation for __init__  (see projective_space for example)

line 106, 108: why not both list and tuple?  Seems like you account for that possibility in lines 113,114, but a tuple wouldn't actually get that far.

line 123: what types of things don't have .parent?

***try to pass a multivariate poly as a center function (line 125)

136,167: bugged --> buggy

***try radius as a function but center not a function (143)

??153: how does precision get passed into __init__

179: move import to top

187: self._base_space has not yet been assigned, so this try/except always fails.
	this is assigned in __init__ for affine/berkovich before this is called. So this init
	will always fail

190/192: the except seems to immediate go to raising a ValueError, why are you not just raising in the except. Also, I don't really like universal except. What are you specifically trapping for here?

196: self._base_type has not yet been assigned
	this is assigned in __init__ for affine/berkovich before this is called. So this init

198: ,*space* pAdicBaseGeneric

208: what is this try/except capturing (needs documentation)

212: don't need the extra () around center.scheme()

216: you attempt to coerce in the padic case why not in this case?

218: instead of saying "wrong field", say what field it is not in

221: "cannot be a point of", can you say have a positive statement instead? "must be a point of ..."

239: does this really work calling a member function within __init__??

244-295: same comments as the padic branch

300-354 : same comments again

356, 366: what do you not try to coerce in the number field case?

377: why not if center[1] == 0, raise ValueError instead of a try/except?
378: center.dehomogenize(1) returns something, do you not care what it is?
	These really should just be a check if center == (1,0)

384-390: try/except with flag again

400-411: more try/excepts

432: should have an example/test of each possibility

465: should use .precision() here since that is the function defined. A second test for .prec

I think the space classes should be in a separate file.

somewhere in here should be the discussion of Qp versus number field + ideal. Just saying it is a possibility in the input is not enough.

2388: missing word: is continuous


2451: perhaps I'm misremembering, but I think the prefered way to check if something is a numberfield is to check if it is in the category of number fields.  if base in NumberFields():

how do you get the ideal back that is used?

Addressed issues pointed above. Here are some comments about the less cut and try feedback:

```
***try radius as a function but center not a function (143) 
-- radius can be an expression (a function) to define type II or III points. 
added special exception to handle when creating type II/III point

872: I'm not sure I like the ... in the middle of these strings.
Is there are reason you went with this?
-- since precision is higher than what is being printed

1137: doesn't this just mean to call the generic center. 
If so, it's inherited so you can just delete this whole function
--different, more precise description. is duplicating worth it?

1696: why not just inherit this function instead of recreating? (add the doc tests)
--better documentation

***partial_order returning true/false seems a little weird.
How are other partial orders done in Sage.
--use four different functions for partial orders. lt and gt implemented, partial order removed

involuton maps needs doctests for all code paths
--all but type IV points done, type IV points are currently bugged.
Will fix type IV points in near future.

somewhere in here should be the discussion of Qp versus number field + ideal.
Just saying it is a possibility in the input is not enough.
--added some discussion in affine and projective space description
```

I didn't find much in the way of functionality issues, but I don't feel like I got all the cases covered. I did find this error

```

l.<w> = NumberField(x^7-5); l
A=Berkovich_Cp_Affine(l, l.prime_above(3))
Q=A(2,1)
Q.involution_map()


AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'

I also still don't like the duplicated code just for small tweaks to the documentation. The functions

- center
- diameter
- potential kernel
- spherical kernel

for example all seem basically identical. We should discuss these when we next meet.


The new file is not added to the docs.


My new branch just made a bunch of small changes to documentation/formatting.

No significant issues this time. A couple minor things.

- The scheme overview doc should get Berkovich Analytic Space added to it (../en/reference/schemes/sage/schemes/overview.html)

- There are a few trailing whitespaces at the end of lines.

Fix those two things and I think this is ready to be marked as positive.

bhutz, gh-EnderWannabe, would you mind clarifying why this was not based on the valuation code?

I see that the code still contains TODOs. I think these should be adressed or turned into followup tickets.

I think it would be nice to run the TestSuite for an element constructed here so that e.g. pickling is tested.

> bhutz, gh-EnderWannabe, would you mind clarifying why this was not based on the valuation code?

We used the disk model of Berkovich space over Cp since that is how dynamicists view Berkovich space. There is support for number fields as long as an ideal is specified, which uses valuations.

> I see that the code still contains TODOs. I think these should be adressed or turned into followup tickets.

These are notes for where Qpbar should be put in the code. They can be changed to simple comments.

> I think it would be nice to run the TestSuite for an element constructed here so that e.g. pickling is tested.

Good idea, added.

<div id="comment:59" align="right">comment:59</div>

On the right of each patchbot report, there are small round icons (green or red) that are called "patchbot plugins". They check some points about the documentation, to make sure that it follows the guidelines. For example, the first line of each documentation should use "Return" and not "Returns", and similar little issues.

Here you have bad coverage, unused imports, and wrong use of "Returns".

It is not mandatory to have all of them green, as there are sometimes false red warnings. But at least one should try to get them green if possible.

ah yes, I see those. I thought you were referring to the 32-bit failure.

I think some of those should be addressed and some are ok to fail. The following should be fixed.

coverage failure:

```
schemes/berkovich/berkovich_space.py: 75.0% (12 of 16)
```

pyflakes issues:
