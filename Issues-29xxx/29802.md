On 9.2beta0

```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: min(a,+Infinity)
a
sage: min(+Infinity,a)
+Infinity
```
returning a in both cases would be best, but at the very worst this should consistently throw an error imo.

Keywords: **symbolics, infinity, minimum, maximum**

Component: **documentation**

I am pretty sure we tried doing something along the lines of making this easier to find, but apparently not.  For instance, it could be useful in plot documentation too - see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/4FIp2Qczx40/r2n4sC70uu4J).

As for the suggestion, are there any other [builtins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that we are able to treat in this manner?  Other than things like `repr() = __repr__()`?  I don't see anything about `min` or `max` [in the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization) on custom classes.

Interestingly, we actually do do this for `abs` (see [builtins list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs)), and it causes a problem, because 

```
sage: abs?
Signature:      abs(x, /)
Docstring:      Return the absolute value of the argument.
Init docstring: Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
File:           
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
```
But presumably we want something more than that, such as the content [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/functions/other.py?id=7cef50b2542c2b90e8a60b88beb6fc6d09d0d380#n44).  I'm not sure why this is what is returned.

Anyway - maybe that means we *can* overload `min`/`max` somehow, maybe even as naively as for `abs`.  Though note [#6949 comment:2](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6949#comment:2).
