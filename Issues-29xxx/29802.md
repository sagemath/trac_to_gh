On 9.2beta0

```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: min(a,+Infinity)
a
sage: min(+Infinity,a)
+Infinity
```
returning a in both cases would be best, but at the very worst this should consistently throw an error imo.

Keywords: symbolics, infinity, minimum, maximum

Status: new

This is Python's built-in min. Try `min_symbolic`

`@`mkoeppe, thanks, sorry for the noise, I searched pretty hard for this information (using Google and trac search). I wonder how we could make this information more discoverable?

Perhaps adding a `min` method to `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` to compute the minimum of `self` and `other` in this way?

Interestingly, we actually do do this for `abs` (see [builtins list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs)), and it causes a problem, because 

```
sage: abs?
Signature:      abs(x, /)
Docstring:      Return the absolute value of the argument.
Init docstring: Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
File:           
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
```
But presumably we want something more than that, such as the content [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/functions/other.py?id=7cef50b2542c2b90e8a60b88beb6fc6d09d0d380#n44).  I'm not sure why this is what is returned.

Anyway - maybe that means we *can* overload `min`/`max` somehow, maybe even as naively as for `abs`.  Though note[comment:2](#comment%3A2):ticket:6949.
