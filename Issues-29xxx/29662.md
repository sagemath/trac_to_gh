Right now in [sage stats](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/stats/index.html) there are a few very basic things, and then lots of very technical stuff sampling from e.g. polynomials or for hidden markov modeling!

In this ticket, we deprecate `sage.stats.basic_stats`, which is underdeveloped. Users are usually better off to learn to use other facilities available in Python that provide better coverage and consistency. For example, `mean` happens to work with vectors (which is used in some doctests elsewhere in sage), but `variance` does not.

Note that Python 3 comes with a basic [built-in stats module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html), but much of its functionality is incompatible with Sage's numbers in #28234.

In the deprecation messages, we instead point users to suitable `numpy` and `scipy` functions, as well as to `pandas` (for `moving_average`).

 Right now in [sage stats](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/stats/index.html) there are a few very basic things, and then lots of very technical stuff sampling from e.g. polynomials or for hidden markov modeling!
 
 This ticket is to split the more technical stuff (which presumably may still be used for researchers, but not for the sort of things basic R or pandas data frames would be) into a separate module where it can be taken care of.

this might be an upstream bug.
One should check whether this works with unusual numpy types, by the way. If it doesn't we have a case...

 Right now in [sage stats](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/stats/index.html) there are a few very basic things, and then lots of very technical stuff sampling from e.g. polynomials or for hidden markov modeling!
 
-This ticket is to split the more technical stuff (which presumably may still be used for researchers, but not for the sort of things basic R or pandas data frames would be) into a separate module where it can be taken care of.
+In this ticket, we deprecate `sage.stats.basic_stats`, which is underdeveloped. Users are usually better off to learn to use other facilities available in Python that provide better coverage and consistency. For example, `mean` happens to work with vectors (which is used in some doctests elsewhere in sage), but `variance` does not.
 
-Note that Python 3 comes with built-in stats module.
-https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html
+Note that Python 3 comes with a basic [built-in stats module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html), but much of its functionality is incompatible with Sage's numbers in #28234.
+
+In the deprecation messages, we instead point users to suitable `numpy` and `scipy` functions, as well as to `pandas` (for `moving_average`).

Maybe this is an argument to improve variance, rather than delete it?

I think that having sage versions of `mean` and `variance` in the global namespace are useful to many users. Much more than `EllipticCurve` let say.

numpy and python are floating point focused when it comes to mathematics. This is not what sage tries to teach.

This is in line with other Python packages. 

By the way, one of the worst is currently `sum`, which overloads Python's sum at Sage prompt, but does not do this in the library.

Having said that, nothing then would prevent one from having "classical Sage" module, which populates the global namespace with stuff.

Indeed, and then with `from sage.all import *` people can get a standard set of stuff in their global namespace. And the `sage` command environment should probably preload that, just as the preparser. It's great if sage can work like a python package, but the sage-specific environment is very valuable for quick stuff.
