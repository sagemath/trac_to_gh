This is a prerequisite for #28197 - ipython does no longer honor the DICT_IS_ORDERED variable since 7.10 [1].

[1] https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/dffa2c33dea3ecc09256a66a6ddbc876ce0629a9

For doctesting we overwrite the default pretty print function for dictionaries to sort the keys and behave exactly as before.

The idiom `sorted(D.items())` is already used in several places in the doctests. Alternatively,

```
sage: from pprint import pprint
sage: pprint(D)
```
could be used to print a dict sorted by keys, which also seems to take care of nested dictionaries.

On the other hand, if one really wants to keep the sorted output of dicts in general, another solution would be to add a displayhook during doctests that imitates what is currently done by IPython.

Thanks for the suggestion! The routine I was thinking about already exists!. I think in "examples" doctests, the `pprint` is a little more desirable, because its output looks like a dictionary: reading the example with the printed output barely has any additional cognitive load. For that purpose, it might be worth considering to inject `pprint` in the global namespace by default. I think it serves a real purpose now that IPython dict printing is no longer sorted.

True, but that would cause a deviation between doctest output and the output that the actual example in the command line would give. The `IPython` reason for dispensing with sorting dictionaries is a good one, so I would not be in favour of bringing back that hook in general.

This deviation already exists, as the IPython sorting of dicts is only active during doctests. That said though, I do not have a strong preference for either solution ‚Äì though I agree it is generally desirable to keep doctest output as close as possible to the actual output.

It seems pretty_print aims at a different target: its default is latex output in the command line (that's a bad default), and in general "this function chooses the highest-quality output supported by the user interface", so that doesn't quite hit the goals of doctests (which should be concise and human-readable).

If we do

```
dm = get_display_manager()
dm.preferences.text='plain'
```
we end up with better results for our doctesting purposes. But that would be worse than `from pprint import pprint`.

Making a distinction between `%display plain` and `%display None` is bizarre and seems wrong to me. The usual REPL output at least does not make such a distinction (implemented in `sage.repl.rich_output.display_manager.DisplayManager._preferred_text_formatter`).\n\nShould we add `pprint` to the global namespace then? I am not sure this is the best thing to do, but it seems practical. Or just add explicit `from pprint import pprint` statements in the doctests?",

Replying to [@nbruin](#comment:8):
> It seems pretty_print aims at a different target: its default is latex output in the command line (that's a bad default), and in general "this function chooses the highest-quality output supported by the user interface", so that doesn't quite hit the goals of doctests (which should be concise and human-readable).

I fail to see the rationale behind defaulting to latex, or the intended use case of `pretty_print`. Making a distinction between `%display plain` and `%display None` is bizarre and seems wrong to me. The usual REPL output at least does not make such a distinction (implemented in `sage.repl.rich_output.display_manager.DisplayManager._preferred_text_formatter`).

Should we add `pprint` to the global namespace then? I am not sure this is the best thing to do, but it seems practical. Or just add explicit `from pprint import pprint` statements in the doctests?

I agree that generally doctests should be focussed on testing very specific things rather than entire dictionaries. Rewriting all these doctests case-by-case so that dictionaries are not printed anymore seems like a huge task though.

As the current patch also seems to fail with 32-bit, it still seems to me that the simplest approach to move forward with this is to extend `pretty_print` by a sort keyword. A first step for this is #29136, needing review, which stops `pretty_print` from outputting latex on the command line.

For reference, this problem was discussed in this [thread on devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/fXrv4JC6NEI/LwIcVb5EEwAJ) and there does not seem to be much disagreement about this.

It is a quite economical way to do things. But we have to document somewhere how dictionaries have to tested going forward. As far as I can see people still want or keep testing full dictionaries. Which leaves two options
* `sorted` if we are sure it does the job in every case
* since we are typing the whole dictionary anyway, create a `expected_dict` populated with expected value and compare it to the result dictionary we get. I would hope dictionary comparison doesn't care about sorting.

I am looking at some stuff in .rst file. It is both doctests and documentation. For example in `doc/en/prep/Advanced-2DPlotting.rst`

```
Here are the options for contour plots.

- They are given as an "attribute" \- no parentheses \- of the
  ``contour_plot`` object.

- They are given as a dictionary (see :ref:`the programming tutorial
  <Advanced>`).

::

    sage: contour_plot.options
    {'aspect_ratio': 1,
     'axes': False,
     'colorbar': False,
     'contours': None,
     'fill': True,
     'frame': True,
     'labels': False,
     'legend_label': None,
     'linestyles': None,
     'linewidths': None,
     'plot_points': 100,
     'region': None}
```
the documentation aspect doesn't really care about the sorting. It is just displaying. But this is doctested as well which does. Using an `expected_dict` variable doesn't make sense in this context. If we use `sorted` we have to make a note about it in the documentation that it is just to make presentation consistent. If we just reproduce the output, the order may change unexpectedly.

Can you expand?\n\n> I am -1 a strong on marking things as `# random` and instead replacing them with more meaningful doctests (like comparing the result to a fixed dictionary, or getting specific values in the result, etc.).\n\nWe are talking about only putting `random` in specific documentation where it doesn't matter and ordering would look weird. But even there I would agree on getting as specific as possible to avoid having to do it. For example, in the same file as [comment:28](#comment:28) and after it we have\n\n```\nsage: contour_plot.options[\"fill\"]=False\nsage: contour_plot.options\n{'aspect_ratio': 1,\n 'axes': False,\n 'colorbar': False,\n 'contours': None,\n 'fill': False,\n 'frame': True,\n 'labels': False,\n 'legend_label': None,\n 'linestyles': None,\n 'linewidths': None,\n 'plot_points': 100,\n 'region': None}\n```\nWhere we could look specifically at the concerned dictionary element. But the one in [comment:28](#comment:28) is part of an exposition of a feature. It feels ridicule to compare the output or to to artificially order it as opposed to just mentioning that the elements are not always in that order.\n\nWe have to use some common sense on what is appropriate and what isn't.",

You are losing me here. Can you expand?

We are talking about only putting `random` in specific documentation where it doesn't matter and ordering would look weird. But even there I would agree on getting as specific as possible to avoid having to do it. For example, in the same file as [comment:28](#comment:28) and after it we have

```
sage: contour_plot.options["fill"]=False
sage: contour_plot.options
{'aspect_ratio': 1,
 'axes': False,
 'colorbar': False,
 'contours': None,
 'fill': False,
 'frame': True,
 'labels': False,
 'legend_label': None,
 'linestyles': None,
 'linewidths': None,
 'plot_points': 100,
 'region': None}
```
Where we could look specifically at the concerned dictionary element. But the one in [comment:28](#comment:28) is part of an exposition of a feature. It feels ridicule to compare the output or to to artificially order it as opposed to just mentioning that the elements are not always in that order.

We have to use some common sense on what is appropriate and what isn't.

If you have

```
sage: foo  # random
2 + 2
```
this also will pass even if `foo` is a `dict` or `'fish'` (i.e. I can make `2 + 2 = 'fish'`).

I guess in this case because it is meant to be for an illustrative purpose that it is fine for a `# random` with an explanation.

Maybe removing the sorting of dictionaries isn't necessary. We can just overwrite the pretty print function during testing:

No, I didn't upgrade and it worked for me.

The function `_sorted_for_pprint` that it uses requires iPython at least 5:

If that is a problem or if this is ever removed, we can just copy paste this tiny function.
