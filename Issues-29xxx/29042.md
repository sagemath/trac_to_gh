This is a prerequisite for #28197 - ipython does no longer honor the DICT_IS_ORDERED variable since 7.10 [1].

[1] https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/dffa2c33dea3ecc09256a66a6ddbc876ce0629a9

For doctesting we overwrite the default pretty print function for dictionaries to sort the keys and behave exactly as before.

This is going to be quite fragile, because now you're encoding a rather arbitrary dictionary order into the doctests, where no order matters (in py3 it's probably insertion order; a change in code somewhere that changes insertion order would break tests again!).

Why not introduce a little utility function `print_dict_sorted` that recovers the sorted dictionaries? It would amount to

```
sorted( D.items(), key=lambda t:t[0])
```
but with an appropriate routine you could print the result in a more dict-compatible way so that you can fix each doctest with a single-line edit.

That way you end up with a more future-proof fix, and it makes total sense to insert such a print routine at least into the doctest namespace (but then almost by necessity also in the interactive namespace)

The idiom `sorted(D.items())` is already used in several places in the doctests. Alternatively,

```
sage: from pprint import pprint
sage: pprint(D)
```
could be used to print a dict sorted by keys, which also seems to take care of nested dictionaries.

On the other hand, if one really wants to keep the sorted output of dicts in general, another solution would be to add a displayhook during doctests that imitates what is currently done by IPython. This would be more robust than using `pprint` everywhere, as it is likely that new doctests depending on insertion order would be introduced in the long run otherwise.

Thanks for the suggestion! The routine I was thinking about already exists!.

True, but that would cause a deviation between doctest output and the output that the actual example in the command line would give. The `IPython` reason for dispensing with sorting dictionaries is a good one, so I would not be in favour of bringing back that hook in general.

This deviation already exists, as the IPython sorting of dicts is only active during doctests. That said though, I do not have a strong preference for either solution – though I agree it is generally desirable to keep doctest output as close as possible to the actual output.

It seems pretty_print aims at a different target: its default is latex output in the command line (that's a bad default), and in general "this function chooses the highest-quality output supported by the user interface", so that doesn't quite hit the goals of doctests (which should be concise and human-readable).

If we do

```
dm = get_display_manager()
dm.preferences.text='plain'
```
we end up with better results for our doctesting purposes. But that would be worse than `from pprint import pprint`.

I agree that generally doctests should be focussed on testing very specific things rather than entire dictionaries. Rewriting all these doctests case-by-case so that dictionaries are not printed anymore seems like a huge task though.

As the current patch also seems to fail with 32-bit, it still seems to me that the simplest approach to move forward with this is to extend `pretty_print` by a sort keyword. A first step for this is #29136, needing review, which stops `pretty_print` from outputting latex on the command line.

For reference, this problem was discussed in this [thread on devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/fXrv4JC6NEI/LwIcVb5EEwAJ) and there does not seem to be much disagreement about this.

I am looking at some stuff in .rst file. It is both doctests and documentation. For example in `doc/en/prep/Advanced-2DPlotting.rst`

```
Here are the options for contour plots.

- They are given as an "attribute" \- no parentheses \- of the
  ``contour_plot`` object.

- They are given as a dictionary (see :ref:`the programming tutorial
  <Advanced>`).

::

    sage: contour_plot.options
    {'aspect_ratio': 1,
     'axes': False,
     'colorbar': False,
     'contours': None,
     'fill': True,
     'frame': True,
     'labels': False,
     'legend_label': None,
     'linestyles': None,
     'linewidths': None,
     'plot_points': 100,
     'region': None}
```
the documentation aspect doesn't really care about the sorting. It is just displaying. But this is doctested as well which does. Using an `expected_dict` variable doesn't make sense in this context. If we use `sorted` we have to make a note about it in the documentation that it is just to make presentation consistent. If we just reproduce the output, the order may change unexpectedly.

We have to use some common sense on what is appropriate and what isn't.

If you have

```
sage: foo  # random
2 + 2
```
this also will pass even if `foo` is a `dict` or `'fish'` (i.e. I can make `2 + 2 = 'fish'`).

Ah, I see. I misinterpreted what you were asking about. I was thinking it was being made as a more broad statement. Sorry.

> Where we could look specifically at the concerned dictionary element. But the one in [comment:28](#comment%3A28) is part of an exposition of a feature.

I guess in this case because it is meant to be for an illustrative purpose that it is fine for a `# random` with an explanation.

Maybe removing the sorting of dictionaries isn't necessary. We can just overwrite the pretty print function during testing:

No, I didn't upgrade and it worked for me.

The function `_sorted_for_pprint` that it uses requires iPython at least 5:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/5.x/IPython/lib/pretty.py

If that is a problem or if this is ever removed, we can just copy paste this tiny function.

The function `for_type` has been in their since IPython version 1. So I hope that it is somewhat stable.
