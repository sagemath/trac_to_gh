From https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/WshDn3e_l3k/YInQI_-WAwAJ:

the real issue is that when building iml the libraries are hardcoded to reside at /lib, but in multilib systems this may not be the case. Specifically, in Slackware (see #29798 for slackware-multilib) we have lib for 32-bit and lib64 for 64-bit. I fixed this by changing this line in build/pkgs/iml/spkg-install.in:

SAGE_GMP_LIB="`echo "$SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE" | sed 's|/include|/lib|'`"

to this:

SAGE_GMP_LIB="`echo "$SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE" | sed 's|/include|/lib{$LIBDIRSUFFIX}|'`"

where LIBDIRSUFFIX is specified by our build to be null for 32-bit or 64 for 64-bit.

Upstream IML should be smarter about detecting GMP, it just guesses at `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/lib` by default.

To that end: it would be nice if the pkg-config file for gmp included the `-L/usr/libX` flag needed to link against it in the "Libs" field. But in the meantime we can probably fake it with...

```
$ pkg-config --variable=libdir gmp
/usr/lib64
