I was just going to look at scipy 1.4 (in fact I have doctest run going on). 

Note that setting the reviewers field doesn't actually cc people.

You are talking about networkx, is it safe and better to move to a newer version in your experience? I have 2.4 available in my tree. We'll have to look at matplotlib as well - considering the last two upgrades that may not be fun.

The deprecation warning fixes in networkx and in this ticket are orthogonal - both need to be applied eventually. The networkx fix is not yet in any stable release and the patch is huge and doesn't apply over the latest release [1] - I don't think it's worth the effort of trying to rebase it.

The upgrade to networkx 2.4 it pretty straightforward - there is just one test failure (caused by an expected deprecation warning that no longer happens, ironically). The matplotlib upgrade is also quite painless - there are just a couple of minor test failures related to pixel metric changes, one of which is an issue already with the current version (just not detected by doctests, cf. #28449)

All of these upgrades are python3-only, so I guess they need to wait for the outcome of the python2-support-in-9.1 discussion.

OK the networkx stuff in `graphs/generic_graph.py` is real ugly.

But I think we should be able to fix this one in this ticket

1 item had failures:

    [11 tests, 1 failure, 1.11 s]
```
It is part of a code block

```
    sage: import scipy
    sage: from scipy import integrate
    sage: def f_1(y,t):
    ....:    return[y[1],-y[0]-10*y[1]*(y[0]**2-1)]
    sage: def j_1(y,t):
    ....:    return [ [0, 1.0],[-2.0*10*y[0]*y[1]-1.0,-10*(y[0]*y[0]-1.0)] ]
    sage: x= scipy.arange(0,100,.1)
    sage: y=integrate.odeint(f_1,[1,0],x,Dfun=j_1)
```
I think it is totally fine to add an import of numpy and do the suggested replacement.

Yes that's one issue that started noticing at least a couple of years ago. I have a section in my install script to deal with all sort of unwanted results. I am not particularly sophisticated about that one

```
		# restore .rst.txt file to .rst
		for i in `find build_doc -name \*.rst.txt`; do
			mv "${i}" "${i%.txt}"
		done
```
but now I am testing them too.
