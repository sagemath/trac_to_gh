Sage Allows the user to create a graph and test it various parameters, Instead this time, how about we create a function within Sage which allows the user to create a graph of a particular shape, choose the number of vertices from the inputs to be fit into those shapes, decide whether it is directed or undirected, and then carry out the functions on it? 
My proposed function looks something like this

```
def shape(Graph): 
      input = shape(#the shape of your choice):
        input the start and end, then Also define whether the graph should be directed or not
       if there are insufficient vertices:
            error()
      else:
         proceed
```

You propose a new (di)graph generator, right? This is certainly a good idea, but I don't fully understand your idea. could you be more precise ?

Hello, yes thats what I intend to. See while working with graphs, as a beginner you have an idea of shapes which you would like to implement graphically for better understanding. When you generate graphs with Sagemath, you get a collection of points and then whether you choose directed or undirected. Also, testing graphical algorithms can be easier because sometimes you simply have a cleared idea of what to expect if you know the properties a graph to a large extent
My idea is something like this

```
def shape(G):
  if points <= 2:
       break
  else:
    input = shape()
    input_1.split () #takes in the starting and the ending points
    return Graph
```
This is a very trivial format, however I would soon try and merge this using trac.
Please let me know your comments

sage: p = RDF.pi()

sage: pol.show(aspect_ratio=1)
