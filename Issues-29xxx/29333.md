Sage Allows the user to create a graph and test it various parameters, Instead this time, how about we create a function within Sage which allows the user to create a graph of a particular shape, choose the number of vertices from the inputs to be fit into those shapes, decide whether it is directed or undirected, and then carry out the functions on it? 
My proposed function looks something like this

```
def shape(Graph): 
      input = shape(#the shape of your choice):
        input the start and end, then Also define whether the graph should be directed or not
       if there are insufficient vertices:
            error()
      else:
         proceed
```

My idea is something like this

```
def shape(G):
  if points <= 2:
       break
  else:
    input = shape()
    input_1.split () #takes in the starting and the ending points
    return Graph
```
This is a very trivial format, however I would soon try and merge this using trac.
Please let me know your comments
