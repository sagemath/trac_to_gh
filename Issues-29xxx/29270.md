As far as I can tell, there is not much connection between [the various sage-combinant trees](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/ordered_tree.html#sage.combinat.ordered_tree.OrderedTree) and the "graph theory" ones.  E.g. I couldn't figure out how to get

```
sage: G = graphs.BalancedTree(2,5)
sage: G.show(vertex_labels=False, vertex_size=0, layout='tree', tree_root=0)
```
from the combinatorial ones.

This might just be missing documentation, or an enhancement request to connect them more.

Yes, something like that.  But for some reason not every tree from the combinat had this in the tab-completion.

```
sage: R = RootedTree([[], [[]]])
sage: R.to_undirected_graph()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
AttributeError: 'RootedTrees_all_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute 'to_undirected_graph'
```
Since I was looking for a rooted tree, this seemed like something to try ...

Anyway, I'm not necessarily suggesting this is an actual code thing, maybe documentation.  Then again, I don't see why a tree couldn't be a tree.
