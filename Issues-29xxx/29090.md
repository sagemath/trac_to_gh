This ticket updates implementation and use of `build/bin/sage-system-python`.

1. The script now prefers `python3` over `python`, and in fact checks several more executable names such as `python3.7`.

2. Because `sage-download-file` needs the `urllib` module (which is for example not provided by Debian's `python3-minimal` package), it only accepts a python that provides it.

3. A mistake from #28657 (as reported in #28738) is fixed - `src/bin/sage-location` should use Sage's python, not the system python.

4. Error reporting is improved, it gives a clearer error message instead of messages such as (see #28738 or https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/412019418)

```
/sage/build/bin/sage-system-python: line 24: exec: : not found
```

5. In `configure`, we now call `sage-system-python` and exit with an error if no suitable system python is found.

I am expecting this all to make sense and I don't think it's going to.

Placing "python" later in the list might do weird things on Gentoo, where `eselect python` is used to select the system python (what "python" does). If someone has selected python-3.6 but happens to have 3.8 installed, the script will choose 3.8 instead. I don't foresee a real problem here, just mentioning it for posterity.

I would suggest `$()` in configure.ac over backticks again, but other than it looks OK.
