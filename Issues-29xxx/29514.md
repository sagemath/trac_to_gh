This ticket implements `__format__` for elements in `RDF` and `CDF`. See also #29212 for a related discussion.

The real number format immediately delegates to `float`, whereas the complex format matches the usual `repr` of elements in `CDF` as closely as possible (unlike Python's type `complex`).

```
sage: '{:.4e}'.format(RDF(2/3))
'6.6667e-01'

sage: format(CDF(32/3, 0), ' .4f')
' 10.6667 + 0.0000*I'

sage: format(CDF(-2/3, -2/3), '.4e')
'-6.6667e-01 - 6.6667e-01*I'

sage: format(CDF(0, 2/3), '.4')
'0.6667*I'

sage: format(CDF(2, 0), '.4')
'2.0'
```

For reference: the [format specification](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) in Python.
