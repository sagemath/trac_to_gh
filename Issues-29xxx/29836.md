```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(backend='normaliz')
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: P.dilation(sqrt2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'generator' object has no attribute 'list'
```

The reason for this is simple. With optimization in #29200, it seems that generators are passed down to the normaliz backend and this isn't ready for this yet (when converting the data to the normaliz field).
