```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(backend='normaliz')
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: P.dilation(sqrt2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'generator' object has no attribute 'list'
```

The reason for this is simple. With optimization in #29200, it seems that generators are passed down to the normaliz backend and this isn't ready for this yet (when converting the data to the normaliz field).

In 

```

+            sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)              # optional - pynormaliz

```
the last line needs to be optional as well. If you don't have `pynormalize` you get a nice `NameError: name P is not defined` message in your doctests.
