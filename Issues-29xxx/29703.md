Follow-up from #29674 (fedora-32: If gcc 10 is found, install gcc spkg; fix building gcc (9.2.0) spkg with gcc 10). As noted there, on many systems, building `--without-system-gcc` fails. 

gcc 10.3 was released 2021-04-08.

Potentially helpful for `fedora-34` (released end of April 2021), which uses gcc 11, which our configure script rejects. 

We also need a newer gcc to provide a gfortran for macOS builds (`homebrew-macos-minimal`, `macos-nohomebrew`) on Big Sur
