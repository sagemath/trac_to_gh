To my understanding, the way that current jupyter depends on the ssl module (via `tornado` - see 30674), it is merely a dependency and no SSL is actually spoken to anyone but possibly localhost.

SSL would still kick in when pip packages are installed - but these are all optional and users have been warned.

Currently, the macOS binaries don't have any version of openssl at all.  So there, the choice is 3.0 alpha or nothing, meaning the user is unable to run Jupyter notebooks, which is a pretty core feature of Sage for many users.

I say go for it, the current situation is causing a lot of people problems, see all the posts to sage-support and sage-devel.

On Linux, Sage doesn't need to provide its own copy of openssl, it just uses the system library.  The problem is macOS deprecated openssl in favor of their own APIs and only provides openssl 0.9.8, which is too old to be useful.

I imagine the people that build from source use a decent distribution of packages that includes `openssl` like homebrew, as recommended in the Sage installation documenation.

I do not like the current way as it will install an immature implementation of SSL within Sage for most people, since even on some OS that ship `openssl-dev`, this latter is rarely installed by default, see e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47513/rise-in-jupyter/

The warning are probably not enough (and probably lost among tons of configure lines) since people will just go ahead and "prefer" using the standard `openssl` spkg over installing the lib from their distro.

<a id='comment:30'></a>I'm also uneasy with an alpha stage OpenSSL 3 becoming standard.

Maybe we can create an "openssl3" optional package for now?

We should advertise the `fix_mac_sage` scripts by the 3-manifolds group

- https://github.com/3-manifolds/fix_mac_sage/

that can "fix" a Sage install on macOS by adding SSL and tkinter to its Python.

We should advertise it

- in the README file that is shipped with macOS binaries
- on the macOS download page of the SageMath website
