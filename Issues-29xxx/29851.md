As per the wiki, running 

```

build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh debian "@(standard|optional)" > Dockerfile
```


Generates a Dockerfile, but running the dockerfile fails because Debian (at least) comes with Python3.8, not 3.7. This can be fixed by changing the file build/pkgs/python3/distros/debian.txt, but I don't know if that will have unexpected consequences.

I already noticed the problem. So what this does it just make the workflow go through, even though it coulnd't install python3.7. It will later find out that no suitable python can be found and install python3.7 for sage.
