As per the wiki, running 

```

build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh debian "@(standard|optional)" > Dockerfile
```


Generates a Dockerfile, but running the dockerfile fails because Debian (at least) comes with Python3.8, not 3.7. This can be fixed by changing the file build/pkgs/python3/distros/debian.txt, but I don't know if that will have unexpected consequences.

Yes, this will have to be changed when we support Python 3.8 (#27754). At the moment, we only accept Python 3.7.x in `configure`; ticket #29033 adds Python 3.6.x support.
