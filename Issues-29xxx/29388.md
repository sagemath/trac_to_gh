This ticket is regarding the prototype I am proposing to sage math for the project Fast evaluation of symbolic expressions.

The objective is to make the following work

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: f = cos(x) + 3 * sin(x)**2
sage: g = fast_callable(f, vars=['x'], domain=RDF)
sage: a = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.4], dtype=float)
sage: g(a)    # currently raises a TypeError
array([1.0249043 , 1.21733307, 1.37600093])
```

I need a little clarity regarding the following points,

* I am slightly unclear about the project goals/ Major contributions section, can you please briefly describe the idea behind it.



P.S. i would also love to contribute in Diameter, radius, eccentricities, and distances what should I be doing to get in contact with other mentors?
