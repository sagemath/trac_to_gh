This ticket tries to enable threads in the NTL build, as suggested in #27764.

As of the NTL upgrade ticket #20590, we build the NTL SPKG with NTL_THREADS=off. (On that ticket, it was noted "we cannot take advantage of the threading until a number of things are resolved. Threading requires C++11 and a number of packages are behind the curve.")

Enabling threads in NTL will require work on at least the following:
- Singular - at least on homebrew (see #29339/#29104).
- Flint - see #27764
