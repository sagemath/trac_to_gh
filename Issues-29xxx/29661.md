There are some easy optimzations that speed up the computation of regions of hyperplane arrangements:

- To see if an hyperplane intersects a polyhedron non-trivially can be done by quickly checking the evaluation of the hyperplane normal on the Vrepresentation. This is much faster than computing two new polyhedra every time.
- In case of a linear hyperplane arrangement, we can only consider the upper half space with respect to the first hyperplane and then append to each region the negative.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: from itertools import product
sage: def zero_one(d):
....:     for x in product([0,1], repeat=d):
....:         if any(y for y in x):
....:             yield [0] + list(x)
....:          
sage: K.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(3))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 141 ms, sys: 7.6 ms, total: 148 ms
Wall time: 146 ms
32
sage: K.<x,y,z,w> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(4))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 1.64 s, sys: 18.2 ms, total: 1.66 s
Wall time: 1.66 s
370
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 2min 2s, sys: 298 ms, total: 2min 2s
Wall time: 2min 2s
11292
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 22.7 s, sys: 73.1 ms, total: 22.8 s
Wall time: 22.8 s
11292
sage: K.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(3))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 46.4 ms, sys: 8.03 ms, total: 54.4 ms
Wall time: 53 ms
32
sage: K.<x,y,z,w> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(4))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 1.05 s, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 1.05 s
Wall time: 1.05 s
370
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 22.2 s, sys: 31.8 ms, total: 22.2 s
Wall time: 22.2 s
11292
sage: %time y = tuple(-P for P in A.regions())
CPU times: user 10.7 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 10.8 s
Wall time: 10.8 s
```

The last timing indicates that half of the time in this example is taken just to create the object and cannot be improved (in this method).

One comment:

Probably a comment like

```diff
+                # Determine if all vertices lie on one side of the hyperplane.
+                splits = False
+                direction = 0
```

Would complete the following one:

```diff
+                if not splits:
+                    # All vertices lie in one closed halfspace of the hyperplane.
```

I am a bit perturbed by the for loop followed by an if statement that ultimately modify the value of `splits`. Is there a way to fusion them and keep the efficiency provided by the `break`?

But now that I look at it more, probably it is the best way to do so. Hm.

Another thing: if the algorithm you wrote is described in the article you mention, it should be added in the documentation of the function.

Btw, is there a way to obtain a n-dimensional hyperplane arrangement without concretely specifying the generators?

You mean for example something like a library of hyperplane arrangements?

There is

```
sage: p = polytopes.simplex()
sage: p.hyperplane_arrangement()
Arrangement of 5 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 4
```

Do you mean whether hyperplane arrangements accept other types of input?

Thank you. I applied that.

The backslash in the if clause is needed though.
I also don't understand why I should adjust the alignment the way you suggested.
It looks nicer, but it suggests that the second clause is part of the any-clause, doesn't it?

Replying to [gh-kliem](#comment%3A13):
> The backslash in the if clause is needed though.


Ah right. I miscounted the number of parentheses.

> I also don't understand why I should adjust the alignment the way you suggested.
> It looks nicer, but it suggests that the second clause is part of the any-clause, doesn't it?


See the previous point. I agree with not changing the alignment. If I was coding this, I would have done it like this:

```python
                        if (any(ieq[1:]*r[:]*direction < 0 for r in region.rays())
                            or any(ieq[1:]*l[:] != 0 for l in region_lines)):
```
However, that is my style and my general desire to avoid the `\` so it generates an error if things are not properly matched. So don't feel you have to change it.
