There are some easy optimzations that speed up the computation of regions of hyperplane arrangements:

- To see if an hyperplane intersects a polyhedron non-trivially can be done by quickly checking the evaluation of the hyperplane normal on the Vrepresentation. This is much faster than computing two new polyhedra every time.
- In case of a linear hyperplane arrangement, we can only consider the upper half space with respect to the first hyperplane and then append to each region the negative.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: from itertools import product
sage: def zero_one(d):
....:     for x in product([0,1], repeat=d):
....:         if any(y for y in x):
....:             yield [0] + list(x)
....:          
sage: K.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(3))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 141 ms, sys: 7.6 ms, total: 148 ms
Wall time: 146 ms
32
sage: K.<x,y,z,w> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(4))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 1.64 s, sys: 18.2 ms, total: 1.66 s
Wall time: 1.66 s
370
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 2min 2s, sys: 298 ms, total: 2min 2s
Wall time: 2min 2s
11292
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 22.7 s, sys: 73.1 ms, total: 22.8 s
Wall time: 22.8 s
11292
sage: K.<x,y,z> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(3))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 46.4 ms, sys: 8.03 ms, total: 54.4 ms
Wall time: 53 ms
32
sage: K.<x,y,z,w> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(4))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 1.05 s, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 1.05 s
Wall time: 1.05 s
370
sage: K.<x,y,z,w,r> = HyperplaneArrangements(QQ)
sage: A = K(*zero_one(5))
sage: %time len(A.regions())
CPU times: user 22.2 s, sys: 31.8 ms, total: 22.2 s
Wall time: 22.2 s
11292
sage: %time y = tuple(-P for P in A.regions())
CPU times: user 10.7 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 10.8 s
Wall time: 10.8 s
```

The last timing indicates that half of the time in this example is taken just to create the object and cannot be improved (in this method).

Note that this ticket is motivated by a new implementation in polymake by Lars Kastner and Marta Panizzut, see [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13548.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13548.pdf).

The example to benchmark is taken from their paper.

One comment:

Probably a comment like

```diff
+                # Determine if all vertices lie on one side of the hyperplane.
+                splits = False
+                direction = 0
```

Would complete the following one:

```diff
+                if not splits:
+                    # All vertices lie in one closed halfspace of the hyperplane.
```

I am a bit perturbed by the for loop followed by an if statement that ultimately modify the value of `splits`. Is there a way to fusion them and keep the efficiency provided by the `break`?

But now that I look at it more, probably it is the best way to do so. Hm.

Another thing: if the algorithm you wrote is described in the article you mention, it should be added in the documentation of the function.

Btw, is there a way to obtain a n-dimensional hyperplane arrangement without concretely specifying the generators?

You mean for example something like a library of hyperplane arrangements?

There is

```
sage: p = polytopes.simplex()
sage: p.hyperplane_arrangement()
Arrangement of 5 hyperplanes of dimension 4 and rank 4
```

Do you mean whether hyperplane arrangements accept other types of input?

Thank you. I applied that.

The backslash in the if clause is needed though.
I also don't understand why I should adjust the alignment the way you suggested.
It looks nicer, but it suggests that the second clause is part of the any-clause, doesn't it?

Ah right. I miscounted the number of parentheses.

See the previous point. I agree with not changing the alignment. If I was coding this, I would have done it like this:

```python
                        if (any(ieq[1:]*r[:]*direction < 0 for r in region.rays())
                            or any(ieq[1:]*l[:] != 0 for l in region_lines)):
```
However, that is my style and my general desire to avoid the `\` so it generates an error if things are not properly matched. So don't feel you have to change it.
