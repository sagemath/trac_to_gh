Apparently, the wedge product is not performed on multiple cores when parallel computation is enabled. According to the compontent-wise computation of general tensors, I add this feature for the wedge product for alternate forms, too.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Interestingly, I dropped the summation completely, and still, the computation takes longer than without parallelization. This is odd, isn't it?

Even this modification doesn't improve anything:

```python
        ind_list = [(ind_s, ind_o) for ind_s in cmp_s._comp
                                   for ind_o in cmp_o._comp
                    if len(ind_s+ind_o) == len(set(ind_s+ind_o))]
        nproc = Parallelism().get('tensor')
        if nproc != 1:
            # Parallel computation
            lol = lambda lst, sz: [lst[i:i + sz] for i in
                                   range(0, len(lst), sz)]
            ind_step = max(1, int(len(ind_list) / nproc))
            local_list = lol(ind_list, ind_step)
            # list of input parameters:
            listParalInput = [(cmp_s, cmp_o, ind_part) for ind_part in
                              local_list]

            @parallel(p_iter='multiprocessing', ncpus=nproc)
            def paral_wedge(s, o, local_list_ind):
                partial = []
                for ind_s, ind_o in local_list_ind:
                    ind_r = ind_s + ind_o
                    partial.append([ind_r, s._comp[ind_s] * o._comp[ind_o]])
                return partial
            for ii, val in paral_wedge(listParalInput):
                for jj in val:
                    cmp_r[[jj[0]]] = jj[1]
        else:
            # Sequential computation
            for ind_s, ind_o in ind_list:
                ind_r = ind_s + ind_o
                cmp_r[[ind_r]] += cmp_s._comp[ind_s] * cmp_o._comp[ind_o]
```

If `nproc` is set to 1, the original speed is preserved.

I am fully aware that this leads to wrong results and the summation should be covered within the parallelization, somehow. Nevertheless, this seems strange to me.
