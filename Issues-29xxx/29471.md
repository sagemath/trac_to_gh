During automated testing with [GitHub](GitHub) actions we get the following error on many debian and ubuntu distros:

```
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/r.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/r.py", line 1318, in sage.interfaces.r.R.plot
Failed example:
    r.library("lattice")
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        raise ImportError("R library {} not installed".format(library_name))
    ImportError: R library lattice not installed
```

see e.g. [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655815](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655815).

We fix this by adding the package `r-cran-lattice` to `build/pkgs/r/distros/debian.txt`.

In general this is expected behavior. If you skip the recommended packages of R (on your system) then your R interface in sage will not have all features. The error message is meaningful and the user should know what to do about it.

That is very interesting, and could only have happened as we allows system R now in some circumstances.  I would be willing to bet there are other standard libraries that not every system R has that we configured to build in "our" R - maybe this ticket should be to ensure that system R has *all* of them.  (They are really very standard so it's not a big burden, and if someone really wants to use a system R without them, then they just get failing doctests.)

In any case, don't do this as `not tested`, though - we would still want to test that Sage-the-library built from scratch passes its own doctests.

On Debian and Ubuntu r-cran-lattice is a recommended package for r-base-core https://packages.debian.org/buster/r-recommended (part of r-recommended).

If we require those packages in order to use the system R, we should do so at configure.

If we want this to be optional and still want to keep the doctest, I think we would need some flag like `# optional -- r-recommended`. I don't know if this is even possible.

For context, in the automatic tests defined by `tox.ini` and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` (which is what is run on [GitHub](GitHub) Actions), packages are installed on Debian distributions using `apt-get install --no-install-recommends`. 

If the `lattice` package is important (I don't know as I don't use R), we can certainly add `r-cran-lattice` to `build/pkgs/r/distros/debian.txt`.
