#28095 adds `configure --enable-SPKG`.

As a follow-up, using this new interface we reimplement `sage -i` for optional/experimental packages, falling back to direct invocation of make for all other packages.

Ah, I misread this at first--I thought you were proposing to *replace* `sage -i` as the way to install optional packages.

If I understand correctly though, you are just proposing a change to how it works internally.  If so I'm +1.

With a fully built Sage, running `./sage -i -p_group_cohomology` just ran `configure` once.

Let me clarify about the other case. I took a fresh tarball for *9.1.beta8*, got this branch and ran `git rebase develop`. That's when `configure` ran three times. The first time:

```
% ./sage -i meataxe                           
make -j6 build/make/Makefile --stop
make[1]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
rm -f config.log
mkdir -p logs/pkgs
ln -s logs/pkgs/config.log config.log
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... config/install-sh -c -d
checking for gawk... no
...
```
The second time:

```
real	0m0.206s
user	0m0.156s
sys	0m0.038s
Sage build/upgrade complete!

running ./configure   '--enable-meataxe'
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... config/install-sh -c -d
checking for gawk... no
```
The third time:

```
checking for the package system in use... homebrew
configure: No equivalent system packages for homebrew are known to Sage
make -j6 build/make/Makefile --stop
make[1]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
rm -f config.log
mkdir -p logs/pkgs
ln -s logs/pkgs/config.log config.log
running CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/sh /bin/sh ./configure --enable-meataxe --no-create --no-recursion
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... config/install-sh -c -d
checking for gawk... no
```
If I start with a 9.1.beta7 tarball and use this branch, `configure` only runs twice.
