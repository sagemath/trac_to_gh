From #29415:

```
groebnerCone.cc: In member function 'groebnerCones groebnerCone::tropicalNeighbours() const':
groebnerCone.cc:449:13: error: 'pointsOutwards' was not declared in this scope
         if (pointsOutwards(ray[j]))
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make[9]: *** [Makefile:726: gfanlib_la-groebnerCone.lo] Error 1
this is on Debian, and might be due to using gfan
```

workaround is to do export CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -UNDEBUG" in Singular build script.
