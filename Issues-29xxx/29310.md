As the summary says. It may be good enough to move the targets `clean`, `sagelib-clean`, `build-clean`, `doc-clean`, `doc-src-clean`, and `doc-output-clean` from `build/make/deps` to the top-level `Makefile`.

This would make things faster and more quiet.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Moving the cleaning targets to the top-level Makefile could make sense.

Most of the above lines really don't need configured variables.

For cleaning within `SAGE_LOCAL` (and `SAGE_VENV`):

As you say, `make distclean` unconditionally removes all of `SAGE_ROOT/local`.  But if `--prefix` has been used to set `SAGE_LOCAL` to something else, that tree is not removed (and it should not; see discussion in #21775).

So it only matters what is to be done when `SAGE_LOCAL` has been set to something else.

To run a line such as `rm -rf "$(SAGE_LOCAL)/var/tmp/sage/build"`, we could try to source `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-src-env-config`, which defines the configured `SAGE_LOCAL` and `SAGE_VENV`. If that fails (because `configure` has not run), do nothing.

I'm not sure about `rm -rf "$(SAGE_SHARE)/doc/sage"`. This not only removes build artifacts such as the inventory files, but it also uninstalls the built HTML documentation. I don't think this should be done by any target called `...-clean`.
(see #29097 - `build/make/Makefile.in`: Rename make targets `SPKG-clean` to `SPKG-uninstall`)

```
SAGE_ROOT = $$(pwd)

clean-test:
    echo $(SAGE_ROOT)
```
then `make clean-test` would print

```
echo $(pwd)
/Users/palmieri/....
```
With the current version, if I add the same target `clean-test`, then `make clean-test` prints

```
echo /Users/...
/Users/...
```
It seems safest to have `SAGE_ROOT` defined once, not defined in terms of `pwd` which could change in the middle of a recipe.

The reference to `SAGE_LOCAL` does not work - the syntax $(...) is referring to a Make variable, but you want a shell variable. So `$$...` should be used instead.

Also, for extra safety, best to test that the variable is nonempty before passing it to `rm -rf`...
