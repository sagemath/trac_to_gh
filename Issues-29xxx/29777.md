Currently, padic rings do not support xgcd. In this ticket we add code to implement the (currently mathematically incorrect) padic gcd for padic rings via `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial`, with a warning stating that xgcd could be incorrect.

Replying to [@roed314](#comment%3A4):
> I would check that the precision behavior works as expected, and make sure that it works over `Zp` not just `Qp`.

Precision behavior works as expect, however low precision computations break over `Zp`:

```
sage: R.<x> = Zp(3,1)[]
sage: f = 3*x + 7
sage: g = 2*x + 3
sage: f.gcd(f*g).is_one()
True
```

To fix this, we pass to Qp to do the computation and then clear denominators. This is done in the _xgcd_univariate_polynomial function under pAdicRingGeneric. Incidentally, this also implements xgcd for pAdic rings.

Also, the old gcd function in polynomial_padic_capped_relative_dense is removed, as it is no longer needed.

I've been running of few of the examples in 13439 to see if those work now. For the most part I'm getting the correct answers. However, this seems weird

```
sage: R.<t> = ZpCA(7,20)[]
sage: (t^3).gcd( t^5 )
(1 + O(7^20))*t^3 + O(7^20)*t^2 + O(7^20)*t + O(7^20)
```

```
sage: R.<t> = Zp(7,20)[]
sage: (t^3).gcd( t^5 )
(1 + O(7^20))*t^3
```


A few other minor things

- you need INPUT and OUTPUT blocks

- why do you need args and kwds   (also note the standard spelling of kwds)

- you can use self instead of arg[0]

- first line description of function should end in a period.

Apparently that is t^3:

```
sage: (t^3).gcd( t^5 ) == t^3
True
```

> - you need INPUT and OUTPUT blocks

Done!

> - why do you need args and kwds   (also note the standard spelling of kwds)

Removed!

Done!
