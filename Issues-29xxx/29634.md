```diff
-        if parts in Words() or (len(parts) > 0 and (parts[0] in ZZ or isinstance(parts[0], str))):
+        if parts in Words() or (len(parts) and (parts[0] in ZZ or isinstance(parts[0], str))):
```
Why only `len(parts)` and not simply `parts`?

I would do this

```diff
             return OrderedSetPartitions().from_finite_word(Words()(parts))
         else:
-            P = OrderedSetPartitions( reduce(lambda x,y: x.union(y), map(Set, parts), Set([])) )
+            P = OrderedSetPartitions([reduce(lambda x,y: x.union(y),  # Maybe x.union(frozenset(y))?
+                                             parts, frozenset()))
             return P.element_class(P, parts)
```
as I think we currently require the elements to be hashable and we can let the `OrderedSetPartitions` constructor handle the rest.

-1 on this change:

```diff
-        par = parent(self)
+        par = self.parent()
```
as using the function is actually faster (Cython function versus Python method call).

LGTM modulo these comments.
