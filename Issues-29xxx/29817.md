For system-wide or shared installations, it is unwanted that `sage -i` installs optional packages to the central location. 
This either requires root privileges or in other cases may be completely impossible (e.g. read-only location). 

As a consequence, package maintainers (e.g. for Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu) have even patched out `-i` since it would work against the system's package management. 

It would be ideal to be able to specify a prefix (or have a hardcoded prefix, such as `~/.sage/`) which is user-writable. This is in the spirit of Python virtualenv / venv, NODE_HOME, `~/.go` and other such solutions.
