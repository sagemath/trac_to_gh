This ticket tries to enable threads in the NTL build, as suggested in #27764.

4 years ago, as of the NTL upgrade ticket #20590, we weren't ready to have NTL built with thread safety because of a lack of support for c++11.  (On that ticket, it was noted "we cannot take advantage of the threading until a number of things are resolved. Threading requires C++11 and a number of packages are behind the curve.")

What about now?

```
########## thread safety

NTL_THREADS=on

# Set to 'on' if you want to compile NTL in thread-safe mode.  This requires
# several C++11 features, including atomic types, mutexes, and thread_local
# storage.  Your compiler may not yet support these features.  Setting this
# flag will automatically set the NTL_STD_CXX11 flag (if neither NTL_STD_CXX11
# or NTL_STD_CXX14 is already set). It will also pass -pthread throught to the
# compiler via CXXAUTOFLAGS (if possible).
```

Also do we need to change any cython files? For example, add something like: 
`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -std=c++11`?
