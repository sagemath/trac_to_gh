<a id='comment:4'></a>Do we know which versions of system giac are acceptable? According to our update tickets (see #29552) >= 1.5.0-63 and < 1.6 are fine.

What does the check for `ConvertUTF16toUTF8` in the proposed `spkg-configure.m4` test? Does this test for a minimum version? 

Is there a way to test the patchlevel of giac? `giac --version` does not include this information.
