These simple changes (especially the first one) lead to surprisingly large speed-ups in real computations (larger speedups, in fact, that I'm able to observe in micro-benchmarks!). For instance, using ore_algebra:

9.1.beta0:

```
sage: from ore_algebra.examples import cbt
....: dop = cbt.dop[10]
....: s = dop.leading_coefficient().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
....: %time mat = dop.numerical_transition_matrix([0,s], 1e-30)
CPU times: user 2.45 s, sys: 79 µs, total: 2.45 s
Wall time: 2.45 s
```

with these patches:

```
sage: from ore_algebra.examples import cbt
....: dop = cbt.dop[10]
....: s = dop.leading_coefficient().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
....: %time mat = dop.numerical_transition_matrix([0,s], 1e-30)
CPU times: user 1.65 s, sys: 8.26 ms, total: 1.66 s
Wall time: 1.66 s

I am a little hesitant to use ``@`cached_method` for `gen_embedding` because the embedding could, in principle, originally not be defined and then added. In this case, I think it would be best to implement a custom cache:

```python
if self._gen_emb is not None:
    return self._gen_emb
embedding = self.coerce_embedding()
if embedding is None:
    return None
else:
    self._gen_emb = embedding(self.gen())
    return self._gen_emb
```

Do you mean by misusing `register_embedding()` (which is not supposed to be be called after the parent has been “used”), or is there another mechanism I'm unaware of?

So I can confirm this in an isolated context:

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.x = None
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self):
....:         if self.x is None:
....:             return None
....:         return 5
....:     
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f.bar()
sage: f.x = -2
sage: f.bar()
5
```

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.x = None
....:     @cached_method
....:     def bar(self):
....:         if self.x is None:
....:             return -1
....:         return 5
....:     
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f.bar()
-1
sage: f.x = 0
sage: f.bar()
-1
```
However, the same does *not* hold for ``@`cached_function`

```
sage: x = None
sage: @cached_function
....: def foo():
....:     if x is None:
....:         return None
....:     return 5
....: 
sage: foo()
sage: x = 2
sage: foo()
```
However, I would say this is a bug with ``@`cached_method` because sometimes having a result of `None` is important and a result of a long computation. This is now #29037. So I would be inclined to leave a warning of the effect `This method is cached, so be sure to define the embedding before using it.`
