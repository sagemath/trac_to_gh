These simple changes (especially the first one) lead to surprisingly large speed-ups in real computations (larger speedups, in fact, that I'm able to observe in micro-benchmarks!). For instance, using ore_algebra:

9.1.beta0:

```
sage: from ore_algebra.examples import cbt
....: dop = cbt.dop[10]
....: s = dop.leading_coefficient().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
....: %time mat = dop.numerical_transition_matrix([0,s], 1e-30)
CPU times: user 2.45 s, sys: 79 µs, total: 2.45 s
Wall time: 2.45 s
```

with these patches:

```
sage: from ore_algebra.examples import cbt
....: dop = cbt.dop[10]
....: s = dop.leading_coefficient().roots(QQbar, multiplicities=False)[0]
....: %time mat = dop.numerical_transition_matrix([0,s], 1e-30)
CPU times: user 1.65 s, sys: 8.26 ms, total: 1.66 s
Wall time: 1.66 s
```

Do you mean by misusing `register_embedding()` (which is not supposed to be be called after the parent has been “used”), or is there another mechanism I'm unaware of?
