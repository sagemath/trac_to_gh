```
The documentation for `text3d` suggests that the color of text can be adjusted:
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.html#sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.text3d

But running the example provided results in only black text:

```
text3d("Sage is...",(2,12,1), color=(1,0,0)) + text3d("quite powerful!!",(4,10,0), color=(0,0,1))
```

Inspecting the `threejs_template.html`, in the `addLabel` function, the fill color is hard-coded:

```
context.fillStyle = 'black';
```

Encountered in 9.1.beta3 as well as 8.9.

Keywords: **threejs text color**

The only options currently passed in are text and location:

This commit passes text colors through to the template. Font size isn't being tracked by textures right now, and the entire graphics/keywords system is irritating and needs work, so passing font size should be left for another ticket.

The example above now shows the proper colors. One of the texts is clipped because the underlying Three.js sprite is limited in size. That can be addressed on another ticket as well, after some planned cleanup of sprite processing in the template.

Hi Paul. I was testing out this branch and noticed that the colors weren't displaying in Chrome or Firefox. Looks like the `#` was missing at the beginning of the color string. Prepending it in `base.pyx` fixed it:

```
color = '#' + p.all[0].texture.hex_rgb()
```

I suppose it could also be prepended in the template right before it's used, depending on where you'd prefer to handle it.

Edit: somehow I seem to have changed the commit, though I don't understand how I was able to do that. Maybe because I was browsing the diff while writing this comment?
