Current behavior:

```
sage: G = DiGraph({0: ['a']})
sage: G.incidence_matrix()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```

incidence_matrix method should be able to handle the case when vertices are of mismatched types.

When vertices are of different types, a solution is to give as input an ordering of the vertices

```
sage: G = DiGraph({0: ['a']})
sage: G.incidence_matrix(vertices=[0, 'a'])
[-1]
[ 1]
sage: G.incidence_matrix(vertices=list(G))
[ 1]
[-1]
```
and we will have to proceed with #22349 to stop sorting vertices and edges by default (not easy).

I was wondering why can't we make the following changes:
Instead of calling `self.vertices()`, we can call `self.vertices(sort=False)` which will solve our problem. And then we can modify doc-tests and documentation accordingly.\\

Also, We are kind of expecting the same behavior as above from fixing of #22349
