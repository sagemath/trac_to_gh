Contrary to user expectation, we get:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(5), 3, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
sage: m
[1 2 3]
[4 0 1]
[2 3 4]
sage: m.echelon_form(transformation=True)
[1 0 4]
[0 1 2]
[0 0 0]
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 3, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
sage: m.echelon_form(transformation=True)
[ 1  0 -1]
[ 0  1  2]
[ 0  0  0]
```
No transformation matrix is returned. The docstring of echelon_form() says

* "transformation" -- boolean. Whether to also return the
  transformation matrix. Some matrix backends do not provide this
  information, in which case this option is ignored.

So the default backends does not produce a transformation matrix!

In fact, the "transformation" option is **rarely** supported.

I agree. So we can make backend choice independent from `transformation=True`.

I tried to early detect whether a backend supports transformation matrix. Each backend that does not compute tansformation matrix may raise an exception when given the `transformation=True` argument. If such an exception is raised, then we resort to the default strategy using`extended_echelon_form()` method. But this would add overhead of not much worth to each backend...

It looks to me that this routine gets overridden on a lot of matrix classes, in which the various backends (or "algorithms") are implemented case-by-case. For instance, the one on integer matrices seems to cast an error for certain algorithms if transformation matrix is not specified.

Right.

> Given that the minimal interface seems to be that transformation matrices are *not* supported, I guess the "generic" routine could just do this by augmenting. You'll have to go through all the special cases anyway, and since the backends are explicitly known there, you can just tune for each if augmentation or asking for a transformation matrix is the right thing to do.

I looked through all `echelon_form()` definitions in 

- `matrix_gf2e_dense`
- `matrix_mod2_dense`
- `matrix_modn_dense_template`
- `matrix_cyclo_dense`
- `matrix_integer_dense`
- `matrix_mpolynomial_dense`
- `matrix_rational_dense`
- `matrix_rational_sparse`

My conclusion is that `echelon_form()` basically does not support `transformation` option, except matrices over `ZZ` and uncommon rings.

So I decided to just clarify the misleading docstring.
