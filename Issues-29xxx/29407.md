There is a bug in residue_field method:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(16)
....: F.<x> = FunctionField(K)
....: p = F.places(1)[2]
....: 
sage: p
Place (x + a)
sage: R, from_R, to_R = p.residue_field()
sage: R
Finite Field in a of size 2^4
sage: to_R(x)
a
sage: _.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in a of size 2^4
```

This bug was sneaked in by the recent introduction of function fields of characteristic zero into Sage.

We fix the bug. In addition, we add get_place() method to rational global function fields, which has been already introduced to global function fields in #29154.

If you need more days, how about opening a separate ticket and letting this ticket move on?

<a id='comment:11'></a>OK, I've updated the ticket, but I've got a question.

First, what I've done is return to handling degree one prime ideals as a special case.  I don't see the need for the complexity of `_residue_field_global` in the degree one case.  Do you?

I've also added some test cases to try to catch this bug.

Now, my question: how should `_residue_field` handle elements with non-trivial denominators?  Right now, it just discards the denominator at the end of the function and calls `_to_R` on the numerator.  Is there some reason why this function will only be called on polynomials?

I don't see a significant gain of treating the degree one case separately when the code works for general case. For some situations, the gain might be in performance increase. Here the gain seems negligible. I would revert this change.  

> I've also added some test cases to try to catch this bug.


Ok.

> Now, my question: how should `_residue_field` handle elements with non-trivial denominators?  Right now, it just discards the denominator at the end of the function and calls `_to_R` on the numerator.  Is there some reason why this function will only be called on polynomials?  (I don't see any such restriction.)  


As the docstring says, `_residue_field` treat elements in k[x].

> If not, then I think it should operate on both the numerator and the denominator and raise, perhaps, `ZeroDivisorError`, if the denominator maps to zero.
> Do you agree?


No. Those cases treated in the `residue_field` code for `places`.
