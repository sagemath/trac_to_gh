I will, but I ran into #29449 first.

Replying to [mjo](#comment%3A6):
> What exactly failed?


I see this in the matplotlib log file:

```
                            * The following required packages can not be built:
                            * png
                            * Try installing png with `brew install libpng` and
                            * pkg-config with `brew install pkg-config`
```
and then the build fails.

you say that reinventing the wheel is the correct solution...

Writing tricky autoconf code, where the user can simply do `brew install pkg-config`, seems to be a waste of time to me.
