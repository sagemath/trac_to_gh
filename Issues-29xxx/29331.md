The method `subfield` on number field creates a subfield generated by a single element. We implement a different `subfield_from_elements` which produces a subfield from a list of elements with the two differences that
- it allows a list of elements instead of a single one as argument
- it tries to minimize the minimal polynomial of the generator via PARI polred

The name was choosen by analogy with `sage.rings.qqbar.number_field_elements_from_algebraics`. It might have been better to have a single `subfield` method but the output specifications are different:
- `subfield` returns a pair `(subfield, hom)`
- `subfield_from_elements` returns a triple `(subfield, elements, hom)`
