Follow-up from #29287.

Script packages are installed by special rules in `build/make/Makefile`.

This ticket installs them by `sage-spkg` instead. This enables script packages to participate in the staged installs (`SAGE_DESTDIR`) and uninstallation mechanisms.

This is useful for #29387 to clean up #27870/#29003/#29082, which introduced files in `SAGE_LOCAL` that do not belong to any package and are never uninstalled.

We also make the decision whether `spkg-install` is generated from a template `spkg-install.in` or provided as is in the source tree orthogonal to the distinction `source=script` vs. `source=pip`.
We simply generate `spkg-install` if `spkg-install.in` is present.

Ideally, when done, changing a package's source between script and normal and pip will no longer require running `bootstrap`.
