`build/bin/sage-spkg` already does:

```
        echo "Running the test suite for $PKG_NAME..."
```
and

```
            if [ "$SAGE_CHECK" = "warn" ]; then
                error_msg "Warning: Error testing package $PKG_NAME (ignored)" "make check"
            else
                error_msg "Error testing package $PKG_NAME" "make check"
                exit 1
            fi
```

So we remove the messages printed by individual `spkg-check.in`.
