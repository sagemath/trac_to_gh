Because of the switch to Python 3, the following does not work anymore

```
sage: "{:5}".format(pi)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to
sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.__format__
```

See also [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/6Ms-kNluZyo).

The same `TypeError` is raised in a pure pythonic situation

```
sage: "{:5}".format([1,2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to list.__format__
sage: "{:10}".format(None)
Traceback (most recent call last):

maybe it's just py3 thing. Perhaps it still works with py2-Sage 9.0.

The issue is not limited to symbolic expressions; Sage numbers also suffer from it:
- with Python2-Sage 8.9:

```
sage: "{:5}".format(RR(2))
'2.00000000000000'
sage: "{:5}".format(QQ(2))
'2    '
```
- with Python3-Sage 9.0:

```
sage: "{:5}".format(RR(2))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Python 2, the default implementation of `__format__` implicitly converted the argument to string. In Python 3, one needs to convert explicitly. This was changed because otherwise it would be very difficult to implement `__format__` for an existing class in a backward compatible way because a valid format spec for strings may not be a valid format spec for other classes. See https://bugs.python.org/issue7994. Therefore, implementing a generic `__format__` in `SageObject` by converting to string might not be desirable. Instead, explicitly convert to string:

```
sage: "{!s:5}".format(pi)
'pi   '
sage: "{:5}".format(str(pi))
'pi   '
```

In principle, `__format__` should depend on the type of an object and thus should be implemented for specific classes. For example, I would expect this to work for floating point numbers:

```
sage: "{:.3f}".format(RR(1/3))  # py3
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber.__format__
sage: "{:.3f}".format(RR(1/3))  # py2
...
ValueError: Unknown format code 'f' for object of type 'str'
```
For real numbers, this could be implemented by delegating to `Decimal` which is what [Sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/9aa14250cfcc7b9a62c4c41fa00f90e9f1ce4cfc/sympy/core/numbers.py#L1496) does. For other classes like symbolic expressions, it is less clear what to do.

Then redefine the `__format__` method for integers as `_format_`, and define a `_format_` method for `RR` and some others.

What's the benefit of doing that over just relying on inheritance and overriding `__format__` to achieve exactly the same? It seems to me it's just less efficient: you need to look further up the inheritance tree to retrieve the first `__format__`, and then you need to look up again to find `_format_`; possibly have an expensive failure (do absences of attribute lookups get cached in python?), and then take action.

I know that indirections like `__add__ -> _add_` are required to have the coercion framework hook in, but I'm less sure that `_repr_` and other similar functions have a need. Before copying that design you'd probably first want to have a good reason why it's required.

In the case of `__repr__` this is to support `.rename()`

```
sage: p = Partition([3,2,1])
sage: p
[3, 2, 1]
sage: p.rename("Hello Nils")
sage: p
Hello Nils

Ah good. point. That's a bit of a misfeature in the presence of uniquerepresentation objects, though:

```
sage: M=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: f=M.charpoly()
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R=ZZ['x'] #this ring is constructed completely independently
sage: R.rename("Arrr")
sage: f.parent() 
Arrr
```

Spooky action at a distance ...
