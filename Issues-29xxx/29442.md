File "src/sage/interfaces/tachyon.py", line 175, in sage.interfaces.tachyon.TachyonRT.usage
Failed example:
    t.usage(use_pager=False)
Expected:
    Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version...
Got:
    Usage: tachyon modelfile [options] 
    <BLANKLINE>
    Valid options and accepted formats are as follows (** denotes default behaviour).
    <BLANKLINE>
    Model file formats supported:

```

This seems to have been introduced by using the systems tachyon. It appears that in some cases (depending on the version probably) tachyon does not print out the first lines

Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version 0.98.9

We fix this by testing for the following output:
