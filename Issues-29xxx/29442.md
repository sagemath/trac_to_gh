sage -t src/sage/interfaces/tachyon.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/tachyon.py", line 175, in sage.interfaces.tachyon.TachyonRT.usage
Failed example:
    t.usage(use_pager=False)
Expected:
    Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version...
Got:
    Usage: tachyon modelfile [options] 
    <BLANKLINE>
    Valid options and accepted formats are as follows (** denotes default behaviour).
    <BLANKLINE>
    Model file formats supported:
...
```

This seems to have been introduced by using the systems tachyon. It appears that in some cases (depending on the version probably) tachyon does not print out the first lines

```
Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version 0.98.9   
Copyright 1994-2010,    John E. Stone <john.stone@gmail.com> 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
```

We fix this by testing for the following output:

```
...
Usage: 
  tachyon modelfile [options]...
<BLANKLINE>
Model file formats supported:
  filename.dat ...
```
