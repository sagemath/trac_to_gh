freetype fails to install on `slackware-14.2-minimal`, as can be seen at 
https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/520449598 (via #29354):

```
./builds/unix/libtool --tag=RC --mode=compile windres -o /sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/freetype-2.9.1/src/objs/ftver.lo /sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/freetype-2.9.1/src/src/base/ftver.rc

/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/freetype-2.9.1/src/src/base/ftver.rc:19:20: fatal error: windows.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
windres: preprocessing failed.
```

The upgrade to 2.10.1 fixes it. The upstream tarball URL is in checksums.ini. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" freetype`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.

probably instead of using something meaninful (wget is able to get the file just fine), it uses an improperly set Python-based downloader.

This might be a slackware-specific issue, though.

This seems to solve the problem for slackware standard install.

For minimal install it fails to build git for some reason.

I can also confirm that the upgrade works fine on debian buster and `sage -t --all` passes.
