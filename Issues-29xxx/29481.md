Follow-up from #29113 ("Reimplement `sage -i SPKG` for optional/experimental packages as `configure --enable-SPKG && make build`").

This does not work in some situations as noted in #29418.

We fix it by reverting to the old installation method, but at least print some hints that explain the new configure arguments.

We will revisit this when other aspects of the Makefile have been cleaned up enough.
