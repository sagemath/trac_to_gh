We make `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_LOCAL` optional. If one is unset, we skip setting the various environment variables that depend on it. 

This change hopefully simplifies distribution packaging, with the goal of allowing unmodified scripts `src/bin/sage` and `src/bin/sage-env` to be shipped.

I cannot talk about other distros. I have stopped using and shipping `sage-env` a while back in Gentoo. I only set the following with a patch in the sage executable these days
* SAGE_STARTUP_FILE
* SAGE_RC_FILE
* SAGE_DEBUG
* SAGE_BROWSER

For the rest, whatever is in `env.py` or `sage_conf.py` is enough.

The main issue is that a lot of stuff in there is not that useful at runtime. You need `PATH` properly set and a few other in case you compile something from inside sage but most of the stuff in `sage-env` is not useful anymore once at run-time. I guess you may want to load the sage variables if you start `sage -sh` but that's it.
