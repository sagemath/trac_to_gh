but for the sqrt(5) appearing in the doctests of giac.py I suspect some default configuration that is not dependent of the version of giac. Could it be that the user .xcasrc is taken into account?

Then I think it would be more natural to force the configuration to not use sqrt before the computation with:

`sage: giac.with_sqrt(0);`
NB: this function returns the previous value of this setting so in a doctest it is better to not print the answer)

downgrading giac makes those tests pass again, so there's definitely some change in 1.6 involved.

<a id='comment:16'></a>By the way, it seems that we don't install giac correctly (before or after this update):

The `_latex_` method is broken -- it adds quotation marks

```

I don't know :) - the pexpect interface and the optional giacpy_sage package are the only way to interact with giac right now. I cannot find anything linked with libgiac in sagelib.
But the latex interface in particular? I don't know. The latex spat out for that doctest is different in the currently shipped giac, 1.5.0-63 and 1.5.0-87.
