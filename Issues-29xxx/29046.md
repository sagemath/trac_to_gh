In `GaloisGroup_v2`, rename the method `__call__()` to `_element_constructor_()` to conform to the new coercion model, and improve the formatting of the documentation.  Also, `NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` is re-imported in this method while it has already been imported at the beginning of the module.
