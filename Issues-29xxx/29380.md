This is to fix an installation problem on Debian.

The upstream tarball URL is in checksums.ini. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" e_antic`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.

(from #27952)

I don't get what `upstream_url` does. It doesn't work automatically for me. I still have to manually download the file into upstream.
