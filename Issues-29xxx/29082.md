#29003 introduced 2-stage installation of generated *.pc files, 
via `src/lib/pkgconfig`- but did not provide a way to clean them up at all. And this is a problem (cf. e.g. #29071).
 
Also, in some installations, repeated installations this code leads to 'permission denied' errors when trying to overwrite read-only files:

```

This ticket revises the installation as follows:

- `configure` no longer creates .pc files in the build tree
- Instead it creates rules in `make/Makefile` that create the .pc files in `SAGE_LOCAL`.
- Before pc files are installed into `SAGE_LOCAL`, the targets are removed, to avoid permission problems

This ticket does not solve everything. There may still be problems when switching from a system library to an spkg-provided library. We will use the follow-up ticket #29387 (Complete solution for installing the generated *.pc files) to address this problem.

+- Because the generated files are for sage-the-distribution, not sagelib, they belong into `build`, not `src`.

 This ticket revises the 2-stage installation as follows:
 - Because the generated files are for sage-the-distribution, not sagelib, they belong into `build`, not `src`.
 - Because `configure` (`config.status`) creates them, `make distclean` cleans them.
+- The pc files installed into `SAGE_LOCAL` are uninstalled when necessary - or it is ensured that they are properly overwritten.
 - Code in `build/make/Makefile.in` is removed in favor of creating a new type=script package `sage_system_blas_facade`, whose `spkg-install` does the installation to `SAGE_LOCAL`.
 - `openblas/spkg-configure.m4` sets `SAGE_BLAS=sage_system_blas_facade` if PC files are generated.

-This ticket revises the 2-stage installation as follows:
-- Because the generated files are for sage-the-distribution, not sagelib, they belong into `build`, not `src`.
-- Because `configure` (`config.status`) creates them, `make distclean` cleans them.
-- The pc files installed into `SAGE_LOCAL` are uninstalled when necessary - or it is ensured that they are properly overwritten.
-- Code in `build/make/Makefile.in` is removed in favor of creating a new type=script package `sage_system_blas_facade`, whose `spkg-install` does the installation to `SAGE_LOCAL`.
-- `openblas/spkg-configure.m4` sets `SAGE_BLAS=sage_system_blas_facade` if PC files are generated.
+This ticket revises the installation as follows:
 
+- `configure` no longer creates .pc files in the build tree
+- Instead it creates rules in `make/Makefile` that create the .pc files in `SAGE_LOCAL`.
+- Before pc files are installed into `SAGE_LOCAL`, the targets are removed, to avoid permission problems
+
+This ticket does not solve everything. There may still be problems when switching from a system library to an spkg-provided library. We will use the follow-up ticket #29387 (Complete solution for installing the generated *.pc files) to address this problem.
