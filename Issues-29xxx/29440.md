The doctests in `sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/degenerate_submanifold.py` have problems with time outs.

See for example:
- [[#29104 comment:61](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29104#comment:61)]
- [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ)
- [[#27122 comment:33](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27122#comment:33)]

Part of the problem might be, that the file makes no use of `long time` flags (testing takes 86 seconds on a fast computer without `--long`).

We add those flags and some smaller examples to display functionality of the module. This brings down testing time without `--long`` to less than 30 seconds.
