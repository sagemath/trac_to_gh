In #21533 a convenience function was added to elliptic curves to open the corresponding page on the lmfdb which can contain information which is non-trivial to recompute in sage on the fly.

This ticket adds the corresponding thing for number fields.

Suggestions for other objects both in Sage and the LMFDB where something similar could be added would be great and can be added to this ticket.
