This is a duplicate of #29792.

We added an spkg-configure.m4 for brial in #29369, but had to back it out at the last minute before sage-9.1 in #29490 due to crashes on Fedora 30.

This ticket here is older than #29792. However, as #29792 is already on positive review, I would just leave it like this.
