#29053 adds `tox.ini` to support testing the sage distribution in isolated environments via docker.

This ticket adds toxenvs `local-homebrew-macos-{minimal,standard}` for testing with (best-effort) isolated installations of homebrew on macOS (not using docker).

To test:

```
    brew install tox
    tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard
```

See comments in tox.ini for more examples.

An example run of that is here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/32812271

<a id='comment:26'></a>- mpc should be `libmpc`
- `tachyon` does not seem to be the package we use
- `pari` cannot currently be used by Sage because the pari packages are not in Homebrew
- `glpk` 4.65 should not be used by Sage as long as it is not patched by Homebrew, see #24824

I also have these Homebrew packages installed:

```
cmake freetype gcc git libpng pcre pkg-config openssl xz zeromq
```
Some of these might already be installed automatically as dependencies of others.

Additionally there are:

```
sagemath/science/flint sagemath/science/arb
```
Though, I am not sure about how `flint` in homebrew-core is different from this one.

There seems to be a conflict between `flint` and `sagemath/science/flint`, as `sagemath/science/arb` installs `flint` from homebrew-core as a dependency (which has been added to Homebrew very recently). I am using

```
brew install sagemath/science/flint
brew install --ignore-dependencies sagemath/science/arb
```
as a workaround now, but the arb formula probably needs to be updated.

why? If `AC_FC_FREEFORM` can only be called once, we can move
the call to `AC_FC_FUNC` to the very place it's called.
How about

`homebrew-macos-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/508217500) has many more doctest failures.
Looks like there is some problem with singular.
Some messages from singular:   `univariate factorization depends on NTL(missing)`

In that build, Sage is using the homebrew NTL:

```

```
... but Singular does not find it ....

```

As can be seen in the build logs above, `sagemath/science/arb` installs `flint` from homebrew-core as a dependency. Later, `sagemath/science/flint` is installed only because of `brew upgrade`. This only seems to work because of the coincidence that `sagemath/science/flint` has a higher version number than `flint`, currently. However, `sagemath/science/arb` is only compiled with `flint` (without ntl support) – it is not recompiled after installing `sagemath/science/flint`.

I have opened a [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/homebrew-science/pull/1) to resolve this.

The job `tox-local-homebrew-macos` defined in that file provisions a macOS host, checks out the branch and runs `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard` there. Then it packages up logs and makes them available as an artifact.
