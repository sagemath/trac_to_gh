As reported in #29608, maxima sometimes asks for additional information, but then reports that the information is redundant when an attempt is made to provide the appropriate assumption. The problem seems to go away if the assumption is put inside a `with hold` clause.

```
sage: var('m');
sage: assume(m, 'integer')
sage: D = cos((4 * m + 1)*arcsin(1/sqrt(x^2 + 1)))/sqrt(x^2/(x^2 + 1));
sage: limit(D, x=0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError               Traceback (most recent call last)
    <snip>
RuntimeError: ECL says: Maxima asks: Is cos((4*%pi*_SAGE_VAR_m+%pi)/2) 
positive, negative or zero?

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
    <snip>
ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; 
using the 'assume' command before evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax 
is 'assume(cos((4*%pi*m+%pi)/2)>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is cos((4*%pi*m+%pi)/2) positive, negative or zero?

sage: assume(cos((4*pi*m+pi)/2) == 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <snip>
ValueError: Assumption is redundant

sage: with hold:
....:     assume(cos((4*pi*m+pi)/2) == 0)
....:     
sage: limit(D, x=0)
0
```



Keywords: **maxima, assume**

Component: **symbolics**

I'm no expert, but my guess is that pynac (or somebody else) knows that the left side of the assumption is 0, and decides to be helpful by simplifying it to 0. Thus, maxima receives the assumption `0 == 0`, and quite reasonably rejects this as being redundant.

```
sage: var('m');
sage: assume(m, 'integer')
sage: cos((4*pi*m+pi)/2)
0
```

Suggestions for how to fix this? If my diagnosis is correct, I think pynac (or whoever) should be prevented from messing up assumptions before they are passed to maxima.
