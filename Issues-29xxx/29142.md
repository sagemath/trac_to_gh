sage:t=5.764766515597
sage:numerical_integral(sqrt(diff(f)^2+diff(g)^2),t0,t)
(nan,nan)
```

It works if the first line is changed to

```
sage:var('x')
```

then the output is:

```
sage:numerical_integral(sqrt(diff(f)^2+diff(g)^2),t0,t)
(1.031355273859612e-06, 8.669172196746942e-20)
```

I'm using sage version 9.0 under Arch Linux
My version of gsl is 2.6

Component: **calculus**
