This ticket fixes the `degneglex` term ordering that Sage uses with libsingular.

Using a `degneglex` term order with the libsingular backend gives different results than specified. For example, compare the monomials of degree 4 in increasing order in Sage (left) vs Singular (right):

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex', implementation='generic')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex')
sage: L_R, L_S = [sorted([ring.monomial(*e) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)]) for ring in [R, S]]
sage: L_R == L_S  # should be True
False
sage: [[f.exponents()[0] for f in fs] for fs in zip(L_R, L_S)]  # Sage vs Singular (increasing order)
[[(4, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0)],
 [(3, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0)],
 [(3, 0, 1), (2, 2, 0)],
 [(2, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0)],
 [(2, 1, 1), (0, 4, 0)],
 [(2, 0, 2), (3, 0, 1)],
 [(1, 3, 0), (2, 1, 1)],
 [(1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 1)],
 [(1, 1, 2), (0, 3, 1)],
 [(1, 0, 3), (2, 0, 2)],
 [(0, 4, 0), (1, 1, 2)],
 [(0, 3, 1), (0, 2, 2)],
 [(0, 2, 2), (1, 0, 3)],
 [(0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 3)],
 [(0, 0, 4), (0, 0, 4)]]
```

Sage defines `degneglex` to compare by total degree first, and then by exponents from left to right, so the Singular ordering is wrong.

Additionally, this ticket fixes the conversion of `degneglex` orders from the Singular pexpect interface to Sage.

Moreover, the following issue is fixed:

```
sage: T = PolynomialRing(GF(101^5), 'u,v,w', order=TermOrder('degneglex')).term_order()
sage: T.singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3))
(a(1:%(ngens)i),ls(%(ngens)i))
sage: (T + T).singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3),a(1:3),ls(3))
(a(1:6),ls(6),a(1:6),ls(6))
```

The corresponding order in Singular is defined as `(a(1:3), ls(3))`, which means it uses the [weight vector](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_956.htm#SEC1008) `1,1,1` to compare by degree and then it should use the [local ordering](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_952.htm#SEC1004) `ls`, which also compares left-to-right. This construction looks correct to me.

When using the `neglex`/`ls` ordering, the ordering of the degree 4 monomials is correct, so this looks like an upstream problem.

Actually, using the Singular pexpect interface, instead of libsingular, gives correct results:

```
sage: T = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order=TermOrder('(a(1:3), ls(3))', force=True))
sage: L_T = sorted([singular(T.monomial(*e)) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)])
sage: [f.leadexp().sage() for f in L_T]
[(4, 0, 0),
 (3, 1, 0),
 (3, 0, 1),
 (2, 2, 0),
 (2, 1, 1),
 (2, 0, 2),
 (1, 3, 0),
 (1, 2, 1),
 (1, 1, 2),
 (1, 0, 3),
 (0, 4, 0),
 (0, 3, 1),
 (0, 2, 2),
 (0, 1, 3),
 (0, 0, 4)]
```
So the error must be somewhere between Sage and libsingular.

The libsingular implementation might be using this one:

```
sage: U = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order=TermOrder('(a(1:3), rp(3))', force=True))
sage: L_U = sorted([singular(U.monomial(*e)) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)])
sage: [f.leadexp().sage() for f in L_U]
[(4, 0, 0),
 (3, 1, 0),
 (2, 2, 0),
 (1, 3, 0),
 (0, 4, 0),
 (3, 0, 1),
 (2, 1, 1),
 (1, 2, 1),
 (0, 3, 1),
 (2, 0, 2),
 (1, 1, 2),
 (0, 2, 2),
 (1, 0, 3),
 (0, 1, 3),
 (0, 0, 4)]
```

Ok, indeed that was the problem. I will push a branch soon.

With Sage's specification, `degneglex` and `degrevlex` are equivalent under reversal of variables.

The very very strange thing is I have an example where `degneglex` finishes a computation instantly (before and after this patch), but on the equivalent problem with variables reversed, `degrevlex` is extremely slow. This is why I got interested in this `degneglex` order in the first place.

You are probably aware of this: a "local" monomial ordering is not actually a monomial ordering in the sense of groebner bases on polynomial rings. You can use them to compute in local rings, but then you're computing in a local rings; not a polynomial ring.

I have a naive question on the maths behind this - what's being computed? That's not a Grobner basis, right?

I think Singular's docs are also quite unclear on this point, they don't provide any obvious references to what one gets if this order is selected.

Yes, it does compute Gröbner bases. The ordering `degneglex` as defined by Sage is equivalent to `degrevlex` up to permutation of the variables, namely by mapping `(x_1,…,x_n)` to `(x_n,…,x_1)`. This is what is checked in the doctest I added.

The weight vector `a(1,..,1)` in the ordering has the effect that monomials are first compared by weighted degree, in this case standard degree. Then, for monomials of the same degree, the ordering `ls` is used for the comparison.

Yes, when using a local term ordering, Singular computes in the localization. I am not very familiar with the local orderings in Singular myself. However, for the `degneglex` ordering, you can test that Singular indeed understands that it is a global ordering by checking the `OrdSgn`.

```
sage: %%cython
....: from sage.all import *
....: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular cimport MPolynomialRing_libsingular
....: from sage.libs.singular.decl cimport ring
....: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 3, order='degneglex')
....: cdef ring* S = (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular> R)._ring
....: print(S.OrdSgn)
....:
1        # would be -1 for local orderings
