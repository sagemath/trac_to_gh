This ticket fixes the `degneglex` term ordering that Sage uses with libsingular.

Using a `degneglex` term order with the libsingular backend gives different results than specified. For example, compare the monomials of degree 4 in increasing order in Sage (left) vs Singular (right):

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex', implementation='generic')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex')
sage: L_R, L_S = [sorted([ring.monomial(*e) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)]) for ring in [R, S]]
sage: L_R == L_S  # should be True
False
sage: [[f.exponents()[0] for f in fs] for fs in zip(L_R, L_S)]  # Sage vs Singular (increasing order)
[[(4, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0)],
 [(3, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0)],
 [(3, 0, 1), (2, 2, 0)],
 [(2, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0)],
 [(2, 1, 1), (0, 4, 0)],
 [(2, 0, 2), (3, 0, 1)],
 [(1, 3, 0), (2, 1, 1)],
 [(1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 1)],
 [(1, 1, 2), (0, 3, 1)],
 [(1, 0, 3), (2, 0, 2)],
 [(0, 4, 0), (1, 1, 2)],
 [(0, 3, 1), (0, 2, 2)],
 [(0, 2, 2), (1, 0, 3)],
 [(0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 3)],
 [(0, 0, 4), (0, 0, 4)]]
```

Sage defines `degneglex` to compare by total degree first, and then by exponents from left to right, so the Singular ordering is wrong.

Additionally, this ticket fixes the conversion of `degneglex` orders from the Singular pexpect interface to Sage.

Moreover, the following issue is fixed:

```
sage: T = PolynomialRing(GF(101^5), 'u,v,w', order=TermOrder('degneglex')).term_order()
sage: T.singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3))
(a(1:%(ngens)i),ls(%(ngens)i))
sage: (T + T).singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3),a(1:3),ls(3))
(a(1:6),ls(6),a(1:6),ls(6))
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>The corresponding order in Singular is defined as `(a(1:3), ls(3))`, which means it uses the [weight vector](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_956.htm#SEC1008) `1,1,1` to compare by degree and then it should use the [local ordering](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_952.htm#SEC1004) `ls`, which also compares left-to-right. This construction looks correct to me.

When using the `neglex`/`ls` ordering, the ordering of the degree 4 monomials is correct, so this looks like an upstream problem.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Actually, using the Singular pexpect interface, instead of libsingular, gives correct results:

```
sage: T = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order=TermOrder('(a(1:3), ls(3))', force=True))
sage: L_T = sorted([singular(T.monomial(*e)) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)])
sage: [f.leadexp().sage() for f in L_T]
[(4, 0, 0),
 (3, 1, 0),
 (3, 0, 1),
 (2, 2, 0),
 (2, 1, 1),
 (2, 0, 2),
 (1, 3, 0),
 (1, 2, 1),
 (1, 1, 2),
 (1, 0, 3),
 (0, 4, 0),
 (0, 3, 1),
 (0, 2, 2),
 (0, 1, 3),
 (0, 0, 4)]
```
So the error must be somewhere between Sage and libsingular.

The libsingular implementation might be using this one:

```
sage: U = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order=TermOrder('(a(1:3), rp(3))', force=True))
sage: L_U = sorted([singular(U.monomial(*e)) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)])
sage: [f.leadexp().sage() for f in L_U]
[(4, 0, 0),
 (3, 1, 0),
 (2, 2, 0),
 (1, 3, 0),
 (0, 4, 0),
 (3, 0, 1),
 (2, 1, 1),
 (1, 2, 1),
 (0, 3, 1),
 (2, 0, 2),
 (1, 1, 2),
 (0, 2, 2),
 (1, 0, 3),
 (0, 1, 3),
 (0, 0, 4)]
```

With Sage's specification, `degneglex` and `degrevlex` are equivalent under reversal of variables.

The very very strange thing is I have an example where `degneglex` finishes a computation instantly (before and after this patch), but on the equivalent problem with variables reversed, `degrevlex` is extremely slow. This is why I got interested in this `degneglex` order in the first place.

+This ticket fixes the `degneglex` term ordering that Sage uses with libsingular.
 
+Using a `degneglex` term order with the libsingular backend gives different results than specified. For example, compare the monomials of degree 4 in increasing order in Sage (left) vs Singular (right):
+
+```
+sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex', implementation='generic')
+sage: S = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y,z', order='degneglex')
+sage: L_R, L_S = [sorted([ring.monomial(*e) for e in IntegerVectors(4, 3)]) for ring in [R, S]]
+sage: L_R == L_S  # should be True
+False
+sage: [[f.exponents()[0] for f in fs] for fs in zip(L_R, L_S)]  # Sage vs Singular (increasing order)
+[[(4, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0)],
+ [(3, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0)],
+ [(3, 0, 1), (2, 2, 0)],
+ [(2, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0)],

+ [(0, 0, 4), (0, 0, 4)]]
+```
+
+Sage defines `degneglex` to compare by total degree first, and then by exponents from left to right, so the Singular ordering is wrong.
+
+Additionally, this ticket fixes the conversion of `degneglex` orders from the Singular pexpect interface to Sage.
+
+Moreover, the following issue is fixed:
+
+```
+sage: T = PolynomialRing(GF(101^5), 'u,v,w', order=TermOrder('degneglex')).term_order()
+sage: T.singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3))
+(a(1:%(ngens)i),ls(%(ngens)i))
+sage: (T + T).singular_str()  # should be (a(1:3),ls(3),a(1:3),ls(3))
+(a(1:6),ls(6),a(1:6),ls(6))
+```

<a id='comment:11'></a>I have a naive question on the maths behind this - what's being computed? That's not a Grobner basis, right?

I think Singular's docs are also quite unclear on this point, they don't provide any obvious references to what one gets if this order is selected.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Yes, it does compute Gröbner bases. The ordering `degneglex` as defined by Sage is equivalent to `degrevlex` up to permutation of the variables, namely by mapping `(x_1,…,x_n)` to `(x_n,…,x_1)`. This is what is checked in the doctest I added.

The weight vector `a(1,..,1)` in the ordering has the effect that monomials are first compared by weighted degree, in this case standard degree. Then, for monomials of the same degree, the ordering `ls` is used for the comparison.

Yes, when using a local term ordering, Singular computes in the localization. I am not very familiar with the local orderings in Singular myself. However, for the `degneglex` ordering, you can test that Singular indeed understands that it is a global ordering by checking the `OrdSgn`.

```
sage: %%cython
....: from sage.all import *
....: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular cimport MPolynomialRing_libsingular
....: from sage.libs.singular.decl cimport ring
....: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 3, order='degneglex')
....: cdef ring* S = (<MPolynomialRing_libsingular> R)._ring
....: print(S.OrdSgn)
....:
1        # would be -1 for local orderings
