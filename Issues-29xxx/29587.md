From #29586.

In #24824 we upgraded to GLPK 4.65, released 2018-02-16.
This version of GLPK prints warning messages
"Long-step dual simplex will be used".

Many distros patch GPLK 4.65 to not print
these messages, but Homebrew does not.

[This is also
[fixed in GLPK](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891465#24)
but there has been no release of GLPK since then,
and the GLPK maintainer is currently
[unable to work on it](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2020-02/msg00000.html).]

Since with #29317 we ignore the warning message in doctests,
we can again use Homebrew's GLPK.

Me neither. I see two doctest failures:

```

and

```
