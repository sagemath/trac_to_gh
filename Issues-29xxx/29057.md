`stack` method of `Polyhedron` has the following behavior:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(4)
sage: P.stack(P.faces(3)[0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```
We fix this by extending the `base_ring` of `locus_polyhedron` to its `fraction_field`.

As the inequalities and equations are taken from our original polyhedron, the backend can always handle locus polyhedron.
