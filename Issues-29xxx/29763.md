Lets consider following code

```
F = FunctionField(QQ, 't')
R.<u> = F[]
poly = u^2 + (t^2 + 1)*u - t^2 - t

SR(poly)
# TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Rational function field in t over Rational Field' and 'Symbolic Ring'
```

whereas conversion through Multivariate Polynomial Ring works as expected:

```

P.<t,u> = QQ[]
SR(P(poly))
# t^2*u - t^2 + u^2 - t + u
```


Keywords: **symbolic ring, conversion**

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Usual caveat:

```
F=FunctionField(QQ,'t')['t']
```
However confusing it is, we cannot forbid name collisions as such above because of automatic ring constructions:

```
Matrix(FunctionField(QQ,'x'),2,2,[1,0,0,x]).charpoly()
```
Needless to say, conversion of these objects to SR would give rather surprising results.

You are right, but it is possible to notify user that there is dangerous place in his code through warning or with some other instrument.

It is very convenient to have that conversion at least in predictable cases like I've mentioned in the issue.
