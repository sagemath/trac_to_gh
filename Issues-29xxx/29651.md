I tried a few different ways to build the docs of a single file, and got a few different errors. (But one of the methods works, so there is a workaround.) This is with sage 9.1.rc2 on Mac OS 10.15.3.

(1) My first attempt failed because `'DOT_SAGE' is not defined`.

```
% sage --docbuild file=src/sage/plot/text.py pdf
Error building the documentation.
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
  File "/Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py", line 1165, in __init__
    base_dir = os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, 'docbuild', module_name)
NameError: name 'DOT_SAGE' is not defined
```

(2) To avoid the need for `DOT_SAGE`, I gave an explicit build path. This worked better (it made pdf files of all of the plots), but failed with an `AssertionError` (and subsequent `OSError`): `assert app.outdir.startswith(SAGE_DOC)`:

```
% sage --docbuild -o/Users/dmorris/tmp file=src/sage/plot/text.py pdf
...
[latex    ] Exception occurred:
[latex    ]   File "/Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/multidocs.py", line 220, in citation_dir

...
OSError: Exception occurred:
```

(3) To eliminate the `AssertionError`, I added a print statement to tell me the value of `SAGE_DOC`, and I used it for the build path. This worked! (The release number and author show up as "unknown" in the pdf file, but I am guessing that this is the expected behavior.)

```

Latexmk: All targets () are up-to-date
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/local/share/doc/sage/text/output/pdf
```

(4) To save myself some typing, I tried again with a local path for the build directory, but got 

```
RuntimeError: failed to run $MAKE all-pdf in local/share/doc/sage/text/output/latex
```
because 

```
mv: rename text.pdf to local/share/doc/sage/text/output/pdf: No such file or directory`.
```
The directory actually did get created (but is empty). However, it seems that the local path fails because the `$MAKE` command is not running in my working directory (where I ran the `sage --docbuild` command). I don't know whether this is a bug, or the expected behavior.

This branch partially works for me:

- it works with `./sage --docbuild file=src/sage/plot/text.py html`, same with `pdf` instead of `html`.
- it does not work with `./sage --docbuild file=src/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py html`, because that file has citations to references in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`.
- it does not work with a file outside of the Sage library unless that file is in Python's path (for example in the current directory): "WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'foo'" . The documentation is ambiguous; should it work for such files?
