```
This is a follow up ticket on the recently closed #21046, where new code for numerical modular symbols for elliptic curves was added.

1. Issue

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("20a1")
sage: m = E.modular_symbol_numerical()
sage: m(1/2)
```
fails as it attempts to use the code for unitary cusps.

2. Bug

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("361a1")
sage: ms = E.modular_symbol(+1,implementation="num")
sage: ms(1/19)
158837/603592
sage: _*19.
4.99990556534878
```
is a problem with rounding. The correct value is 5/19.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nReplying to [@videlec](#comment%3A5):\n\nI see your point, but surprisingly I disagree. The algorithm produces a floating point number that is within a given precision of the correct result. It is NOT suppose to return the exact value. It will be off and up to a much higher precision all hardware should return the same number.

I see your point, but surprisingly I disagree. The algorithm produces a floating point number that is within a given precision of the correct result. It is NOT suppose to return the exact value. It will be off and up to a much higher precision all hardware should return the same number. The abs tol that I set is higher than whan is guaranteed by the algorithm.

This ticket changes some behaviour of the algorithm and it now produces different values than before.            

```
sage: f(1/7)      # abs tol 1e-4
-            1.00001356670155
+            0.999844176260303
```
is a case where it actually matters.

It is probably a matter of opinion and taste in the end, but I would like to keep output that is not 1.0 for this as it illustrates the errors that are made. If an exact value is needed, one should not use the approximating functions, anyway.

Of course the trailing spaces need to be removed.

Of course your algorithm does not return the exact value. By "expected value" I meant "actual value that the numerical algorithm approximates". Sorry for my unprecise english.

To my mind, you are contradicting yourself.
- If you want to test the actual output of the algorithm then don't write `# abs tol` at all.
- If you want to test how close your algorithm gives an answer to the real one, then do write

  ```
  sage: my_function(xyz)   # abs. tol 1e-5
  exact_value_that_I_should_be_expecting
  ```
- If you want to emphasize that the answer is non-exact to the reader, then the detail of the output does not matter. And there is no need to update anything.

You are in between these three: you use `# abs. tol` but at the same time claim that what is written in the output should match the actual value. I have hard time figuring out the purpose of it.

Should that be considered as a regression?

The issue is easy explained with an example. Say

```
sage: def my_pi(prec=100):
....:     return sqrt(6*sum( 1./n^2 for n in [1..prec] ))
sage: my_pi(10)
3.04936163598207
sage: my_pi(1000)
3.14063805620599
```
I think the doc test for my_pi should NOT check if the answer of my_pi(10) is pi up to n digit, it should check if that given precise answer 3.04936163598207 is exact up to 8 digits, say.

It is a regression in precision, but a speedup. In analogy with the above, the algorithm used to sum 1000 terms when asked to compute it so that the answer can be proven to be smaller than epsilon = 0.1. Now it only needs to do 100 terms and we still know how to prove that the answer is within 0.1.

I can estimate the error of the absolute sum which is an upper bound to the error. I don't want to do any extra work, so I am happy if the answer has an error of 0.1.

Does that help?

`e-11` won't do for all of them but I see that you set `e-9` for the corresponding doctest.

You can test on 32 bit using `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-i386-standard`, for example.
