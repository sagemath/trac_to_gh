Rebuilds should be triggered when headers of relevant packages change.

In `setup.py` (after #29702, `sage_setup.command.sage_build_cython`) we have:

```
# Do not put all, but only the most common libraries and their headers
# (that are likely to change on an upgrade) here:
# [At least at the moment. Make sure the headers aren't copied with "-p",
# or explicitly touch them in the respective spkg's spkg-install.]
lib_headers = { "gmp":     [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'gmp.h') ],   # cf. #8664, #9896
                "gmpxx":   [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'gmpxx.h') ],
                "ntl":     [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'NTL', 'config.h') ]
              }
```
Except for this (which is much too limited and also needs updating in light of the spkg-configure mechanism), we do not have dependency tracking for sagelib. Neither of distutils, setuptools, cython seem to have a mechanism for generating dependencies like `gcc -M`. This would certainly be nice to have; in particular if it included dependencies on "system" headers and libraries, so that sagelib could automatically rebuild when system headers/libraries change (as in, most recently, ​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/A53tGGsJNLg/uA01oUugAQAJ).

Rebuilding whenever any header of any dependency changes is an OK way to fake it, but it's going to trigger unnecessary sagelib rebuilds frequently.

Thanks for the pointer. It's probably a little bit more complicated for us because if I'm not mistaken, upstream packages are not always very careful with their sonames (which is then fixed in distributions)
