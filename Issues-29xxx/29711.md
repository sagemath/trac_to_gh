Rebuilds should be triggered when headers of relevant packages change.

In `setup.py` (after #29702, `sage_setup.command.sage_build_cython`) we have:

```
# Do not put all, but only the most common libraries and their headers
# (that are likely to change on an upgrade) here:
# [At least at the moment. Make sure the headers aren't copied with "-p",
# or explicitly touch them in the respective spkg's spkg-install.]
lib_headers = { "gmp":     [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'gmp.h') ],   # cf. #8664, #9896
                "gmpxx":   [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'gmpxx.h') ],
                "ntl":     [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'NTL', 'config.h') ]
              }
```
Except for this (which is much too limited and also needs updating in light of the spkg-configure mechanism), we do not have dependency tracking for sagelib. Neither of distutils, setuptools, cython seem to have a mechanism for generating dependencies like `gcc -M`. This would certainly be nice to have; in particular if it included dependencies on "system" headers and libraries, so that sagelib could automatically rebuild when system headers/libraries change (as in, most recently, ​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/A53tGGsJNLg/uA01oUugAQAJ).

Rebuilding whenever any header of any dependency changes is an OK way to fake it, but it's going to trigger unnecessary sagelib rebuilds frequently.

Thanks for the pointer. It's probably a little bit more complicated for us because if I'm not mistaken, upstream packages are not always very careful with their sonames (which is then fixed in distributions)

In hindsight, it wouldn't really work for sage anyway. Since the (gentoo) developer makes up the subslot, he's able to change the subslot when the upstream API changes even if upstream doesn't change their soname. But rebuild-on-subslot-change only works for us because we know that all packages will be installed from the same repository. With sage, some packages may come from the system, and then you won't have access to that information. So rebuilding every time the headers change might be the best we can do.
