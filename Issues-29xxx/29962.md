This is the first step towards #29935.

We introduce an option for doctests: `--random-seed`.

This allows specifying which seed to use for tests
involving randomness.

The seed is displayed in the test log:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/all.py 
...
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/all.py
    [16 tests, 0.73 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.8 seconds
    cpu time: 0.7 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
```

which makes it easy to re-run tests with the same seed.

The seed defaults to `0` for now:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/all.py 
...
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/all.py
    [16 tests, 0.73 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.8 seconds
    cpu time: 0.7 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
```

but the plan in #29935 is to eventually have
the random seed itself picked at random by default.

<a id='comment:19'></a>The `random_seed` docstring says seed "must be coercible to a Python long".

Is that from `-2**127` to `2**127 - 1`?
Or are 32-bit and 64-bit systems different there?

Also isn't "long" a Python 2 concept,
with only "int" existing in Python 3?

Could we document the admissible range in a follow-up ticket, for non-experts like me?

<a id='comment:21'></a>I added this issue to #29935.

The idea was that once all parts of Sage are ready for it, the default would be to select a "random" random seed.

+This is the first step towards #29935.
 
+We introduce an option for doctests: `--random-seed`.
+
+This allows specifying which seed to use for tests
+involving randomness.
+
+The seed is displayed in the test log:
+
+```
+sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/all.py 
+...
+Doctesting 1 file.
+sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/all.py

+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Total time for all tests: 0.8 seconds
+    cpu time: 0.7 seconds
+    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
+```
+
+which makes it easy to re-run tests with the same seed.
+
+The seed defaults to `0` for now:
+
+```
+sage -t --long src/sage/all.py 
+...
+Doctesting 1 file.
+sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/all.py

+the random seed itself picked at random by default.
