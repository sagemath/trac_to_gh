This is called in the very low level `get_unsafe`, and there is no reason to go through the (Python) parent to get what is something ultimately done by the backend.

<a id='comment:6'></a>This should fix the doctest failres. I also found some places that I could make some additional optimizations.

With the updated branch, I get additional major speed improvements:

```
673 µs ± 2.87 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)  # 2^4
1.33 ms ± 8.11 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)  # 2^13
```
So it is roughly a 3x speedup versus the previous commit.

Running with NTL:

```
4.42 ms ± 11.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^4
4.94 ms ± 34.5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^13
```
versus vanilla with NTL:

```
8.28 ms ± 49.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^4
9.03 ms ± 103 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)  # 2^13
```
