In SageMath 9.1.beta4:

```
sage: M = cartesian_product((ZZ^2, ZZ^3)); M
The Cartesian product of (Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring, Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring)
sage: M.category()
Category of Cartesian products of modules with basis over (euclidean domains and infinite enumerated sets and metric spaces)
sage: M.base_ring()  # should be Integer Ring
```


Keywords: module, base ring

<a id='comment:2'></a>Should we test for `is R` or `== R`, as I think we could have equal-but-not-identical rings in Sage:

```
sage: S5 = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: S5p = SymmetricGroup(6).subgroup(['(1,2)','(1,2,3,4,5)'])
sage: S5 == S5p
True
sage: S5 is S5p
False
sage: G5 = S5.algebra(ZZ)
sage: G5p = S5p.algebra(ZZ)
sage: G5 is G5p
False
sage: G5 == G5p
False
```
Now I know this is not a demonstration, but it would be quite reasonable for this to someday return `True`. I probably am on the side of actually `is` because the `==` could have base rings that are subtly different, but I wanted to get your thoughts.
