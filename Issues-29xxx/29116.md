When using `affine_basis` of `Polyhedron` with `orthogonal` or `orthonormal` we get the following errors.

```
sage: V =[
....:    [1, 0, -1, 0, 0],
....:    [1, 0, 0, -1, 0],
....:    [1, 0, 0, 0, -1],
....:    [1, 0, 0, +1, 0],
....:    [1, 0, 0, 0, +1],
....:    [1, +1, 0, 0, 0]
....:     ]
sage: P = Polyhedron(V)
sage: P.affine_hull()
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 6 vertices
```

```
sage: P.affine_hull(orthogonal=True) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: V-representation data requires a list of length ambient_dim
```

```
sage: P.affine_hull(orthonormal=True, extend=True)
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in AA^4 defined as the convex hull of 5 vertices and 1 line
```


This happens because the method for computing an affine basis depends on the order of the vertices. We fix that by computing an affine basis of the polyhedron in the right way.
