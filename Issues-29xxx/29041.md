We extend the `sage_bootstrap` package to add the commands:
- `sage -package list --output=install-requires PACKAGES...` (for #30913)
- `sage -package list --output=requirements PACKAGES...`
- `sage -package list --output=pipfile PACKAGES...`
- `sage -package list --output=debian PACKAGE...` etc. (taking over the functionality of the shell script `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`.)

They generate text output in the format of `setup.cfg [options] install_requires=`, `requirements.txt`, and `Pipfile`; or a list of system packages 

`bootstrap` can use these commands to generate these files for  `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/` or `src`.  They are deleted by `make bootstrap-clean`.

Yes, it's an initial example. More can be added on this ticket and/or on follow up tickets.

I think the versions given by sage-the-distribution (`build/pkgs/*/package-version.txt`) should be considered as pinned versions, and information such as `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`/`Pipfile.lock` should come from there in some way.

The allowed version ranges are currently not encoded anywhere. For non-Python packages have `spkg-configure.m4` (#27330), but this is obviously the wrong mechanism for Python packages.  setuptools has them in `setup.cfg [install_requires]`. 

I think I agree with you that this information does not necessarily have to be generated from (new) files in `build/pkgs/` but could be put directly into `src/`, such as `src/setup.cfg`. 


> More practical reason: pipenv works very nicely on Windows, and my hope is to use it without having to use `sage make` beforehand. So one simply clones the code, starts the virtual env with pipenv and gets an editiable install of sage for easy development.


I think some steps are missing here - we don't have a native Windows build of many packages that Sage depends on. But I agree, after modularization (#29705) we should aim for getting a native Windows build of a Sage core at least.

> But for this the pipfile needs to be there without running the bootstrap command. (The alternative would be to rewrite the bootstrap cmd in a OS-independent way, say using powershell.) 


Note that we have the `bootstrap -d` mechanism, which downloads a tarball of the files created by `bootstrap`.  This is how most users and developers get these files. We could look into creating a powershell version of `bootstrap -d`.
