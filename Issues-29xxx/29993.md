I split arithmetic geometry (elliptic and hyperelliptic curves) from algebraic geometry (plane and space curves). Other than this, the changes are minor and rephrasings.

The pdf doc of the TOC does not still render the maths correctly with this ticket. That might be one of the reasons.

Ah! They are actually bug fixes. Look at this page:

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithgroup/index.html

The vertical line, called sidebar toggle, separating the search box on the left and the main content on the right has wrong height and looks ugly.

The changes do the right job to compute the height of the sidebar toggle.

Replying to [@kwankyu](#comment%3A20):
> The pdf doc of the TOC does not still render the maths correctly with this ticket. That might be one of the reasons.

This is fixed now, by somewhat ad-hoc manner.

Along the way, I also resurrected the Sage reference manual website for pdfs, which has been broken (I might be guilty for this).

To check the documentation website for pdf docs, run:

```
sage --docbuild reference pdf
sage --docbuild website html
```
and open `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`.

Running

```
sage --docbuild website pdf

Did you run `sage --docbuild website html`? This copies the PDF icon.

This works, but it should not be necessary: I ran both `sage --docbuild all html` and `sage --docbuild all pdf`, and at least one of those should build the website page. See line 582 in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py`:

```py
            if format == 'pdf':
                # First build the website page. This only takes a few seconds.
                getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()
```

The version I see has (for example) the new sentences "Welcome to the Sage reference manual. Here you find documentation for all of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_'s features, illustrated with lots of examples. A thematic index follows." So it's the new one. (I also ran `make doc-clean` before building the documentation.) I'm attaching `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html`.

Strangely `sage --docbuild all html` does not copy the PDF icon, but ``sage --docbuild website html` does. I don't know why. I didn't touch this part.

> The version I see has (for example) the new sentences "Welcome to the Sage reference manual. Here you find documentation for all of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_'s features, illustrated with lots of examples. A thematic index follows." So it's the new one. (I also ran `make doc-clean` before building the documentation.) I'm attaching `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html`.

Right. It is strange. The file `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html` is generated using the file `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/index.html` as a template. Would you upload this file as well so that I can compare it with mine?

I now see what have happened to you. You did not run `make build`, but only ran `make doc-clean`, `sage --docbuild all html` and `sage --docbuild all pdf`. Right? Thus you built the new document by old docbuild code.

Please try again. This time you run `make; sage --docbuild all pdf`.

Still the PDF icon would not appear. This problem existed before this ticket, I think. Anyway, this copies the PDF icon to the right place:

```
$ sage --docbuild website html

[website  ] Merging environment/index files...
[website  ] ... done (0 todos, 1 index, 0 citations, 0 modules)

[website  ] copying static files... ... done
[website  ] dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
[website  ] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in .../local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website
```

Notice that "copying static files...". Then reload `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`.

To see clearly the problem of the PDF icon:

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild all html` does not install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild website html` does install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

You're right, this fixed it.

Right, that's what I said in [comment:32](#comment%3A32). It would be nice to fix that, too.
