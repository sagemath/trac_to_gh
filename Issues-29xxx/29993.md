Ah! They are actually bug fixes. Look at this page:

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithgroup/index.html

The vertical line, called sidebar toggle, separating the search box on the left and the main content on the right has wrong height and looks ugly.

The changes do the right job to compute the height of the sidebar toggle.

The html version looks good, but I'm having problems with the PDF. You should be able to run `sage --docbuild all pdf` to have it build the html website file and everything else in PDF format.

- Broken before this ticket: in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html, there are supposed to be PDF icons next to each document, as links leading to the PDF builds. Those are missing, because the file `_static/pdf.png` is missing. For some reason, it is not copied from `src/doc/en/website/static` to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/_static`.

- If I copy that file by hand, then the links are available, but the one for the reference manual (`local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html`) is badly formatted. It is an html file with links to the different components in PDF format, but the table of contents basically appear twice, once badly and then once better, but not perfect.

- mathjax is not enabled in that main reference manual html file.

Did you run `sage --docbuild website html`? This copies the PDF icon.

This works, but it should not be necessary: I ran both `sage --docbuild all html` and `sage --docbuild all pdf`, and at least one of those should build the website page. See line 582 in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py`:

```py
            if format == 'pdf':
                # First build the website page. This only takes a few seconds.
                getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()
```

The version I see has (for example) the new sentences "Welcome to the Sage reference manual. Here you find documentation for all of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_'s features, illustrated with lots of examples. A thematic index follows." So it's the new one. (I also ran `make doc-clean` before building the documentation.) I'm attaching `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html`.

Strangely `sage --docbuild all html` does not copy the PDF icon, but ``sage --docbuild website html` does. I don't know why. I didn't touch this part.

I now see what have happened to you. You did not run `make build`, but only ran `make doc-clean`, `sage --docbuild all html` and `sage --docbuild all pdf`. Right? Thus you built the new document by old docbuild code.

Please try again. This time you run `make; sage --docbuild all pdf`.

Still the PDF icon would not appear. This problem existed before this ticket, I think. Anyway, this copies the PDF icon to the right place:

```
$ sage --docbuild website html

[website  ] Merging environment/index files...

[website  ] The HTML pages are in local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website.
Build finished. The built documents can be found in .../local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website
```

Notice that "copying static files...". Then reload `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`.

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild all html` does not install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild website html` does install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

You're right, this fixed it.

Right, that's what I said in[comment:32](#comment%3A32). It would be nice to fix that, too.

I would love to see it fixed. But I have no idea of how to fix it. Do you have?

I suggest to fix it separately, and not to delay this ticket.
