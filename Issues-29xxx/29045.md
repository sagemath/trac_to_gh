For many spkgs, the `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-build` and `spkg-install` script templates set environment variables before invoking `make`.

This ticket allows to move environment variable settings common between these scripts to a `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-env` file, which will be included by `build/bin/sage-spkg` at the top of the generated executable scripts (also named `spkg-build` and `spkg-install`).

Moreover, `sage-spkg` generates an executable script `spkg-buildsh` (next to `spkg-install`) that drops the user into a subshell like `sage -sh` with `spkg-env` loaded.

This makes it easier to test new versions of packages.

 This ticket allows to move environment variable settings common between these scripts to a `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-env` file, which will be included by `build/bin/sage-spkg` at the top of the generated executable scripts (also named `spkg-build` and `spkg-install`).
 
-Moreover, this ticket adds a command
-`sage --buildsh SPKG`
-which sources that file in addition to `src/bin/sage-env`.
+Moreover, `sage-spkg` generates an executable script `spkg-buildsh` (next to `spkg-install`) that drops the user into a subshell like `sage-sh` with spkg-env loaded.
+
+The new command `sage -i -b SPKG` only prepares the build directory (with generated scripts) but does not call build or install.
+
+The new command `sage -i -sh SPKG` prepares the build directory and then calls `spkg-buildsh`.
+
 This makes it easier to test new versions of packages.
