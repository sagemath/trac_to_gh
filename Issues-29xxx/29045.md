```
For many spkgs, the `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-build` and `spkg-install` script templates set environment variables before invoking `make`.

This ticket allows to move environment variable settings common between these scripts to a `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-env` file, which will be included by `build/bin/sage-spkg` at the top of the generated executable scripts (also named `spkg-build` and `spkg-install`).

Moreover, `sage-spkg` generates an executable script `spkg-buildsh` (next to `spkg-install`) that drops the user into a subshell like `sage -sh` with `spkg-env` loaded.

This makes it easier to test new versions of packages.
