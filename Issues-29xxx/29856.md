From the post at

- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/YUGe_Ey823Y/m/zkjpE-YYBgAJ

it appears linking with libstdc++ might be not needed any more, and so this may be simplified.

Note that clang project has libc++, which serves the same role, but is a different implementation.

(Currently stdc++ is mentioned in `src/setup.py`
and in `src/sage/misc/cython.py`.)

Also, `setup.py` does not use `sage.misc.cython` at all if I'm not mistaken.

I see a lot of assembler errors (GNU 'as' version 2.24, ~6 years old)
in building ecm, and elsewhere, on minimal ubuntu-trusty

```
2020-06-16T00:41:24.9539407Z   [ecm-7.0.4.p1]   /tmp/ccEhz4KE.s:342: Error: operand size mismatch for `vmovdqu64'
```

see https://github.com/dimpase/sage/runs/774196885

Not a surprise, as we build a newish gcc, not really compatible with an old `as`, running on hardware not 100% supported by this `as`. Should we just drop this target all together?
