Cleaning means to remove build artifacts from the directory ``@`builddir`@`` (= SAGE_ROOT).
But these targets *uninstall* packages from ``@`prefix`@`=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Hence we rename `SPKG-clean` targets to `SPKG-uninstall` (but keep `SPKG-clean` as an alias.) This also unifies the targets between normal and script packages (the latter used `-uninstall` already). 


We also add implicit rules that allow users to uninstall packages that no longer exist in the source tree. This is preparation for #34203. To test this, switch to the branch of #33530 and build one of the packages added, for example `make fastjsonschema`. Switch back to current `develop` and try to remove it (does not work). Switch to the branch here and run `make fastjsonschema-uninstall` (works).

There could be artifacts that `make doc-uninstall` won't clean up, so I think I want to keep this as `make doc-clean`. I don't know if it should also suggest running `./bootstrap`, but that's a separate issue.

<a id='comment:9'></a>> There could be artifacts that make doc-uninstall won't clean up, so I think I want to keep this as make doc-clean


Right now `doc-clean` does both `doc-src-clean doc-output-clean`. I suggest,

0. Rename `doc-output-clean` to `doc-uninstall` (already done).
1. Drop `doc-clean`
2. Rename `doc-src-clean` to `doc-clean`
3. Change the suggestion to run both `doc-clean` and `doc-uninstall`

That way the targets wind up with the right names, and the suggestion doesn't effectively change.

NB: in this hunk the doc-src-clean was dropped (I don't know which is correct):

```
-doc-html-no-plot: doc-clean $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
+doc-html-no-plot: doc-uninstall $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
```

My only reluctance is that I am very used to typing `make doc-clean` when working with tickets involving docbuilding. I don't know how many others are in the same habit, but we would all have to change that habit.

This should be okay: the reason to clean the docs when toggling `doc-html-no-plot` is because inclusion (or not) of plots is cached in the doc output (in local/share/doc/sage/inventory or maybe .../doctrees). So `doc-uninstall` should be good enough. It works for me, at least.

<a id='comment:36'></a>Thank you for the explanation and the new target; that now makes sense.

Not from this branch: I don't understand `SAGE_I_TARGETS`. `List of targets that can be run using `sage -i` or `sage -f``. The list contains only `sagelib` and `doc`, so is the implication that one shouldn't use `sage -i sagetex`? As far as I can tell, `SAGE_I_TARGETS` is only used in the `list` target.

Regarding this change in `sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py`:

```
     # The default path to this directory; however its value should be read
     # from the environment if possible
     spkg_inst = pth.join(sage_local, 'var', 'lib', 'sage', 'installed')
-    spkg_inst = os.environ.get('SAGE_SPKG_INST', spkg_inst)
```
Is the point that we now have two possible locations for the installation files, either SAGE_LOCAL or SAGE_VENV, so we can't use the single variable `SAGE_SPKG_INST`? I think the comment about reading the value from the environment should probably be removed or changed.

Otherwise things look good.
