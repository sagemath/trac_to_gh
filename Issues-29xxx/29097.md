Cleaning means to remove build artifacts from the directory `@builddir@` (= SAGE_ROOT).
But these targets *uninstall* packages from `@prefix@=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Hence we rename `SPKG-clean` targets to `SPKG-uninstall` (but keep `SPKG-clean` as an alias.) This also unifies the targets between normal and script packages (the latter used `-uninstall` already). 


We also add implicit rules that allow users to uninstall packages that no longer exist in the source tree. This is preparation for #34203. To test this, switch to the branch of #33530 and build one of the packages added, for example `make fastjsonschema`. Switch back to current `develop` and try to remove it (does not work). Switch to the branch here and run `make fastjsonschema-uninstall` (works).

Here is a branch to test out. I wasn't sure about the instruction when docbuilding fails: 

```
    Note: incremental documentation builds sometimes cause spurious
    error messages. To be certain that these are real errors, run
    "make doc-clean" first and try again.
```
There could be artifacts that `make doc-uninstall` won't clean up, so I think I want to keep this as `make doc-clean`. I don't know if it should also suggest running `./bootstrap`, but that's a separate issue.

> There could be artifacts that make doc-uninstall won't clean up, so I think I want to keep this as make doc-clean

Right now `doc-clean` does both `doc-src-clean doc-output-clean`. I suggest,

0. Rename `doc-output-clean` to `doc-uninstall` (already done).
1. Drop `doc-clean`
2. Rename `doc-src-clean` to `doc-clean`
3. Change the suggestion to run both `doc-clean` and `doc-uninstall`

That way the targets wind up with the right names, and the suggestion doesn't effectively change.

NB: in this hunk the doc-src-clean was dropped (I don't know which is correct):

```
-doc-html-no-plot: doc-clean $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
+doc-html-no-plot: doc-uninstall $(DOC_DEPENDENCIES)
```

My only reluctance is that I am very used to typing `make doc-clean` when working with tickets involving docbuilding. I don't know how many others are in the same habit, but we would all have to change that habit.

This should be okay: the reason to clean the docs when toggling `doc-html-no-plot` is because inclusion (or not) of plots is cached in the doc output (in local/share/doc/sage/inventory or maybe .../doctrees). So `doc-uninstall` should be good enough. It works for me, at least.

For the `doc-...` cleaning/uninstalling targets, I would like to understand first whether everything that we put in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/sage/` should really be installed there. 

Are `doctrees` and `inventory` needed in the installation at all? Do other Python packages install inventory files? Or is this just something that is reused and updated in an incremental docbuild?

It allows the tutorial (for example) to refer to the reference manual.

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
The inventory files are intended to allow for cross-references among different pieces of the documentation: see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html and `set_intersphinx_mapping` in `src/sage/docs/conf.py`. It allows the tutorial (for example) to refer to the reference manual. For example, the reference <code>:ref:\`sage.rings.padics.tutorial\`</code> in `tour_numtheory.rst` in the tutorial points to the reference manual, and I think this uses the inventory files to construct the link when building the documentation.

According to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html, the doctrees are used to cache the parsed source files before writing output. Once the output has been written, they aren't needed, so I guess they could be moved somewhere else, and I'm guessing the same for the inventory files, but I think they are all needed when building the docs.

<a id='comment:36'>Comment 36:</a>
Thank you for the explanation and the new target; that now makes sense.

Not from this branch: I don't understand `SAGE_I_TARGETS`. <code>List of targets that can be run using \`sage -i\` or \`sage -f\`</code>. The list contains only `sagelib` and `doc`, so is the implication that one shouldn't use `sage -i sagetex`? As far as I can tell, `SAGE_I_TARGETS` is only used in the `list` target.

Regarding this change in `sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py`:

```
     # The default path to this directory; however its value should be read
     # from the environment if possible
     spkg_inst = pth.join(sage_local, 'var', 'lib', 'sage', 'installed')
-    spkg_inst = os.environ.get('SAGE_SPKG_INST', spkg_inst)
```
Is the point that we now have two possible locations for the installation files, either SAGE_LOCAL or SAGE_VENV, so we can't use the single variable `SAGE_SPKG_INST`? I think the comment about reading the value from the environment should probably be removed or changed.

Otherwise things look good.

And if you're going to fix the comment about environment variables, maybe also fix the docstring for the function to not refer to just `SAGE_LOCAL` but also `SAGE_VENV`? Or point out in the docstring that the variable `sage_local` should be either `SAGE_LOCAL` or `SAGE_VENV`?
