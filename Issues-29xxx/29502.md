Different distos use different subsets of SuiteSparse,
but this is needed to be done. Apparently all we need is CHOLMOD (with its dependencies),UMFRACK and suitesparseconfig.

Configure is OK for iml and suitesparse:

...

suitesparse-5.6.0:                           using system package; SPKG will not be installed


But now cvxopt fails:

[cvxopt-1.2.3]     src/C/umfpack.c:23:10: fatal error: 'umfpack.h' file not found

[cvxopt-1.2.3]     #include "umfpack.h"

Note: on FreeBSD umfpack.h is located under /usr/local/include/suitesparse/umfpack.h. Just let me know if I fix it for FreeBSD or if the same failure could occur on other systems.

On Debian the location of the header is also prefixed.
Probably this is a cvxopt bug.
One might try to find out how Debian works around this.

A naive work-around (just adding -I /usr/local/include/suitesparse) was sufficient to build everything.

I'm going to test your patch to check if it works for me.

Note about u/dimpase/packages/suitesparseconf: actually cvxopt produces 3 python libraries, site-packages/cvxopt/amd.so, site-packages/cvxopt/cholmod.so and site-packages/cvxopt/umfpack.so, and they are linked to libamd.so.2, libsuitesparseconfig.so.5 and libumfpack.so.5 from suitesparse; maybe you would check if they are available in its spkg-configure.m4?

AMD, COLAMD, CCOLAMD are dependencies of CHOLMOD in  SuiteSparse, so it apparently suffices to add a check for UMFPACK (and suitesparseconfig - which presumably is always there, but OK).

Same error on FreeBSD with the Debian's patch of build/pkgs/cvxopt/spkg-install.in : umfpack.h is not found.

I would set something like:

export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${LOCALBASE}/suitesparse/include"

but $LOCALBASE is not set!

Would it be possible to modify build/pkgs/suitesparse/spkg-configure.m4 so that it sets a variable of the include path where SuiteSparse_config.h has been found?

getting a full include path is always a pain, and should not be needed as long as it is in the default compiler path for headers. Doesn't FreeBSD's clang look in `/usr/local/include/` by default (which is always the case on every Linux  I know, and on MacOS) ? Apparently it does not (which is insane, IMHO) - otherwise I don't understand this error on FreeBSD.

On Gentoo, I think users only need to install

* sci-libs/cholmod
* sci-libs/suitesparseconfig
* sci-libs/umfpack

which is a bit less than the whole suitesparse. But currently it doesn't work anyway because the check is looking for the header in the wrong place. Unless they moved it in v5.6.0, upstream SuiteSparse_config installs the header *without* the `suitesparse/` prefix.

CVXOPT however checks both `/usr/include` and `/usr/include/suitesparse`, and nobody else looks for that header, so I think it would be fine to just add the un-prefixed path as an option to that header check.

Those two and even suitesparseconfig should be pulled in as dependency of cholmod. However, if we need dev packages for those as well then we need to check for them.

Sorry, I've been missing trac notifications again.

If `amd.h` is used by cvxopt, we should check for it, because users will probably need to install a `-dev` package on the binary distros to get it. If we don't check here, the ./configure script might think everything's OK with only e.g. `amd` installed and not `amd-dev` until the cvxopt build system crashes much later on.

I agree that not prefixing the headers upstream shows a lack of foresight, but renaming other people's headers as a workaround is a dick move. Gentoo can't prefix them for the same reason no one else should prefix them: other software needs to know where to find them. If we move the headers, every consumer of the library fails to build. Renaming the headers completely changes a package's public API. It's on the same level as changing all of a library's function names to swahili to avoid symbol collisions and then packaging it up with the same name. It can work on a binary distro, but only if you're OK with supporting only pre-built binary software forever. When *every* binary distro does it, you wind up with `n*m` different cases in the `n` packages looking for the `m` places that someone decided to put them.

Slackware, nix, conda, and homebrew are also likely to have them unprefixed for that reason. Not to mention people who just go the website, download the tarball, and install to `/usr/local`.

Right. As `n=1` here, you can see the `1*m` cases attempted in the setup.py I linked earlier.

Oh, I could have sworn that cvxopt was an optional package. That makes sense, then.

This test,

```
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([SuiteSparse_config.h amd.h],
                 [suispa_header_found=yes])
```

is intended to set `suispa_header_found` to "yes" if both headers are found, but the docs for `AC_CHECK_HEADERS` say "If action-if-found is given, it is additional shell code to execute when one of the header files is found."

Looks good now. One last nitpick; you should add quotes here for the people who have spaces in their sage path:

```
if test x$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX != x; then
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}"
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/include"
fi
```

And while the two are equivalent, I think using `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` instead of `SAGE_LOCAL`...

```
if test "x$SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX" != "x"; then
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}"
   export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX}/include"
fi
```

avoids some duplication and uses the `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` variable the way you intended it?

It think it would make more sense to set it to "yes" rather than "$SAGE_LOCAL" in that case?

Either way, it works fine on Gentoo with suitesparse-5.4.0. Should we merge it and cross our fingers, or run it though github first to make sure all of the other distros have usable versions of suitesparse?

I did this https://github.com/dimpase/sage/actions/runs/88161666
before commits starting at [comment:45](#comment%3A45) and have not found any problems.
(apart from the trivial absense of useful system openblas implying no suitesparse,
either)

The spkg-install for cvxopt is doing some weird stuff, but I can't find any immediate problems (and don't think we need to fix them here, in any case). For example,

```
export CVXOPT_GLPK_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}"
export CVXOPT_GLPK_INC_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/include"
```

is unconditionally adding those two library/include paths to the command line as `-L` and `-I` flags, even when we're using system packages. This doesn't cause an immediate problem because `--with-system-foo=yes` and `--with-system-foo=force` get ignored if the foo SPKG is installed, and that's the only way the extra dirs on the command-line could cause a problem. So for example if I install the suitesparse SPKG manually and attempt to use the system suitesparse, there's no risk of the SPKG being accidentally linked into cvxopt via the lines above, because there's no way to avoid using the SPKG in favor of the system copy in the first place.

These calls to pkg-config share the same risk,

```
export CVXOPT_GSL_LIB_DIR="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir gsl)"
export CVXOPT_GSL_INC_DIR="$(pkg-config --variable=includedir gsl)"
```

but so long as any SPKG that is installed and provides a *.pc file *must* be used (ignoring `--with-system` flags), they won't hurt.
