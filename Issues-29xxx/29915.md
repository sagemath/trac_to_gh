As far as I am aware, Sage is unable to numerically solve ODE's higher than degree 1. Higher order (n'th order) ODE's can be written as a system of n-many first order ODE's. So it would be better for the user to enter an n'th order ODE and Sage to automatically understand and write it as a system of n-many first order ODE's then solve and give the result to the user.

This feature would be good for people who are dealing with higher order (>= 2) ODE's. Maybe we should start implementing this feature for numerical solutions first, and then for analytic solutions.
