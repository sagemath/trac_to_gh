This allows us to work with subalgebras of Lie algebras whose indexing set is not naturally ordered (but has a `_basis_key` method):

```
sage: sl3 = LieAlgebra(QQ, cartan_type=['A',2])
sage: D = sl3.derived_subalgebra()  # Fails due to unable to make comparisons
```

Thank you. I designed it so that `_basis_key` would be the hook for sorting things that I needed in a lot of the code going to/from vectors. Then we also needed to be able to pass arbitrary orderings to the submodules (see #26352, although I guess this renders some of that moot). I also think it is a nice feature to have as the linear algebra might be a bit better with different pivots.
