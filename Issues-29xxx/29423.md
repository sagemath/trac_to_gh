This allows us to work with subalgebras of Lie algebras whose indexing set is not naturally ordered (but has a `_basis_key` method):

```
sage: sl3 = LieAlgebra(QQ, cartan_type=['A',2])
sage: D = sl3.derived_subalgebra()  # Fails due to unable to make comparisons
```

Some doctests were updated, but they were trivial from the new term ordering.
