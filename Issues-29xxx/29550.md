On going through the example in  the documentation of `UniformRandomUniform` method following error occurs.

```

Above defect should be fixed as early as possible. As It is already in latest sage release.

P.S : It also passes doctest. So something is wrong there too.

I have just done that, and fortunately there do not seem to be any other errors of this kind. Only two other files have doctests that lead to an error when using the Python 3 `Random` module, but in both cases this is because the tests implicitly depend on a specific "random" result from a previous doctest.
