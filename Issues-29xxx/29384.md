Follow-up from #29038.

We clean up `sage-env-config`, intended for setting direct values only, by moving conditional settings of other environment variables to `sage-env` instead.

Moreover, we move configuration variables that are only needed by the Sage python process but not as environment variables by its child processes, to `sage_conf.py`. In this way they become available in the `sage.all` module even when invoked outside of a `sage-env`.

(part of #21707.)
