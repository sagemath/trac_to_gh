Follow-up from #29038.

We clean up `sage-env-config`, intended for setting direct values only, by moving conditional settings of other environment variables to `sage-env` instead.

Moreover, we move configuration variables that are only needed by the Sage python process but not as environment variables by its child processes, to `sage_conf.py`. In this way they become available in the `sage.all` module even when invoked outside of a `sage-env`.

(part of #21707.)

Do we still need

```
var('SAGE_NAUTY_BINS_PREFIX',        '')
```

in `src/sage/env.py` after this?

Oh, I see. Updated question: is there any reason to be going through sage.env still, as opposed to importing the value directly from `sage_conf`? Something to do with distro packaging?
