This ticket adds support for solving the [generalized eigenvalue problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix#Generalized_eigenvalue_problem) `A v = λ B v` for two matrices `A`,`B` over `RDF` or `CDF`.

Example:

```
sage: A = matrix.identity(RDF, 2)
sage: B = matrix(RDF, [[3, 5], [6, 10]])
sage: D, V = A.eigenmatrix_right(B); D   # tol 1e-14
[0.07692307692307694                 0.0]
[                0.0           +infinity]

sage: λ = D[0, 0]
sage: v = V[:, 0]
sage: (A * v  - B * v * λ).norm() < 1e-14
True
```

This is implemented using [scipy.linalg.eig](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.eig.html).

The changes include:

- an optional argument `other` is added to `eigenmatrix_right/left` in `matrix2.pyx` as well as related functions in `matrix_double_dense.pyx`
- an optional keyword `homogeneous` is added to obtain the generalized eigenvalues in terms of homogeneous coordinates
- improvements to the documentation

I was worried this might be a bit misleading because the actual result will never look like that. However, it makes the documentation much more readable indeed, so I have changed it as you suggested.

That reminds me though: it would be nice if Sage supported the IPython `%precision` [directive](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-precision) in order to get rid of numerical noise like that from the printed IPython output.

The code looks okay. The patchbot says green light.

Personnaly, I do not like so much this part of the changes:

```diff
-        evecs = self.eigenvectors_left()
+        if other is None:
+            evecs = self.eigenvectors_left()
+        else:
+            try:
+                evecs = self.eigenvectors_left(other=other)
+            except TypeError as e:
+                raise NotImplementedError('generalized eigenvector '
+                                          'decomposition is implemented '
+                                          'for RDF and CDF, but not for %s'
+                                          % self.base_ring()) from e
```

Why `self.eigenvectors_left()` can't handle `self.eigenvectors_left(other)` if `other` is `None`?

Why should a `TypeError` be raised if the base ring is not RDF or CDF?

I think the raise `NotImplementedError` should not be raised there, but deeper in the code. No?

Not every implementation of `eigenvectors_left` supported the argument `other`, in which case a `TypeError` would be raised. I do agree though that it is cleaner to add the additional argument to all implementations of `eigenvectors_left` and handle it there.

I have removed that section of the code and updated the branch accordingly. Thank you for the suggestion.

Few more suggestions.

1. I would document the input `other` everywhere, something like:

```diff
-        - ``other`` -- not supported
+        - ``other`` -- a square matrix `B` (default: ``None``) in a generalized
+          eigenvalue problem; if ``None``, an ordinary eigenvalue problem is
+          solved (currently supported only if the base ring of ``self`` is ``RDF`` 
+          or ``CDF``)
```

2. In the following change:

```diff
-        if not self.is_square():
+        if not self.is_square() or other is not None and not other.is_square():
             msg = 'matrix must be square, not {0} x {1}'
+            m = self if not self.is_square() else other
+            raise ValueError(msg.format(m.nrows(), m.ncols()))
```
I would keep one `if` for `self.is_square()` and write another `if` below for `other is not None and other.is_square()`. Merging the two needs to run the code `self.is_square()` twice, which I find not clean.

3. I am worried about the changes not being backward compatible, mainly because of the changes in the ordering of the input arguments. `eigenvalues` methods are used a lot everywhere in the code of everyone. There are surely some places where people did not write the keyword argument `keyword=value`. It seems you made sure of being backward compatible. First, in that change of `matrix2.pyx`:

```diff
-    def eigenvectors_left(self,extend=True):
+    def eigenvectors_left(self, other=None, extend=True):
```

you check if other is a boolean type and you send a deprecation warning:

```diff
+        if other is not None:
+            if isinstance(other, bool):
+                # for backward compatibility
+                from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
+                deprecation(29243,
+                            '"extend" should be used as keyword argument')
+                extend = other
```

But in `matrix_double_dense.pyx`, 

```diff
-    def eigenvalues(self, algorithm='default', tol=None):
+    def eigenvalues(self, other=None, algorithm='default', tol=None,
+                    homogeneous=False):
```

you solve the problem like this:

```diff
+        if isinstance(other, str):
+            # for backward compatibilty, allow algorithm to be passed as first
+            # positional argument
+            algorithm = other
+            other = None
```

with no deprecation warning. Can you tell why?

I will make the changes for 1 and 2.

Regarding the deprecation in 3, I am following what Travis has recently suggested in [This is the Trac macro *ticket:29543* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#ticket:29543-macro). In `matrix_double_dense.pyx` I have not used a deprecation warning just because the code was written before that. I will change it to issue a deprecation warning as well, as this additional argument processing is undesirable in general, and will make sure the function is written in a backward compatible way.

In the long run, Sage should make use of keyword-only arguments, a Python 3 feature, to avoid this kind of problem. See also #16607.

Related to that, I will also make the following change in `matrix2.pyx` in order to make sure that `extend` is only used as a keyword, from now on. The code is already written in a way that makes this backward compatible.

```diff
-    def eigenvectors_left(self, other=None, extend=True):
+    def eigenvectors_left(self, other=None, *, extend=True):
```

This does not work for the methods with more than one optional keyword argument, though – I hope that #16607 will find a more general solution for this eventually.

I agree. I have already started to make use of keyword-only arguments for *new* keywords in some tickets. Deprecating positional use of existing keywords arguments, on the other hand, is another story -- and the performance impact of trying to do that is what stopped #16607 if I remember correctly.

It would be good to recommend this for new code, for example in the developer guide.

As for existing code, performance can be a problem, particularly if we wanted to change it across the whole library. In that case, a non-backward compatible release might be a better option.

However, I am thinking mostly of a decorator that helps in the few cases where we actually want to add a new positional argument, such as:

```diff
-    def eigenvalues(self, algorithm='default', tol=None):
+    def eigenvalues(self, other=None, *, algorithm='default', tol=None, homogeneous=False):
```
Manually writing this in a backward compatible way quickly gets out of hand if there are several optional keywords. Using a decorator here for one year of deprecation would not harm performance too much.

+1

Looks good. I did not know that feature.

I wait for your changes before looking at the branch again.

Yes, I think so, too.

I have updated the branch. The changes should now be completely backward compatible, raising deprecation warnings for positional use of keyword-only arguments.

I have a question. In the following changes inside of the function `def eigenvalues(self, other=None, algorithm='default', tol=None, *, homogeneous=False):` of the file `src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx`, you make the following change:

```diff
+            deprecation(29243, '"extend" and "tol" should be used as '
+                               'keyword argument only')
```
Is it an error that the deprecation warning mentions `"extend"`? It is not an argument of that method...
