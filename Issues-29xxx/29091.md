On Raspberry Pi 4 4GB on Raspbian Buster build failed with fplll:

```
libtool: link: g++ -std=gnu++11 -std=c++11 -fPIC -I/home/pi/sagemath/sage-9.1.be

/usr/bin/ld: ./.libs/libfplll.so: undefined reference to `__atomic_load_8'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

This is fixed by upgrading FPLLL in #30021.

In this ticket, we add Docker-based testing for the platform `raspbian-buster-armhf` so that it can be verified that FPLLL now builds on this platform by the following:

```
  tox -e docker-raspbian-buster-armhf-standard -- fplll
```

<a id='comment:7'></a>I opened this issue in the fplll issue tracker

- Fix ARM-specific problem with new multicore code in fplll 5.3.x

  https://github.com/fplll/fplll/issues/432

but apparently this issue might have been relevant

- add `-latomic` when needed

  https://github.com/fplll/fplll/issues/418

and it was fixed in Apr 2020 by this pull request

- check for -latomic

  https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/419

The current latest release, fplll 5.3.2, is from Jan 2020.
Thus the fix should be tried by using the master branch.
I hope it fixes things and the next release works on ARM.
Sorry for the extra noise.

Actually, it is

```
  tox -e docker-raspbian-buster-armhf-standard -- fplll
```
which will also work on Linux Docker.
