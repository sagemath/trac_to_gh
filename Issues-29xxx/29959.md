looks great, adds a lot of nice stuff, but error messages need to be adjusted
(lambda=1 is fixed there I suppose):

(BIBD(79,13,2) is a largest known biplane (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design#Biplanes), so it would eventually be nice to have, but not on this ticket.

Thanks for the review. The dockets pass, the issue with the `g` is that I often start typing "git" before the os has fully switch from the editor to the console. I should definitely be more careful, but they are tricky to catch as I have run all tests before I use git.

I'll try and implement the biplane now, otherwise I will end up forgetting.

16 x 240 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)

I have fixed the issue. However, I think I'm missing something when running the doctests.
Usually, I execute `sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.py`. How did you end up testing `strongly_regular_db`?
Do I need to run all doctests (`make ptest`) or is there a way to only test the dependencies?

in any event, it makes sense to implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem
to rule out sets of parameters for symmetric BIBDs - so far it is only done in Sage for 
pojective planes, see `projective_plane` in `src/sage/combinat/designs/block_design.py`

a typo in docstring:

```
In particular, Sage can build a `(v,k,1)`-BIBD when one exists for all `k\leq
```

there should be `\lambda` instead of `1`.

Also, change the previous line

```
    sage: BIBD = designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(7,3)
```
to use `(7,3,1)`.

I'll change the `(7,3,1)`, but I'm not sure the other sentence should be changed.
