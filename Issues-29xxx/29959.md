looks great, adds a lot of nice stuff, but error messages need to be adjusted
(lambda=1 is fixed there I suppose):

```

    274 
    275 def steiner_triple_system(n):

(BIBD(79,13,2) is a largest known biplane (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design#Biplanes), so it would eventually be nice to have, but not on this ticket.

Thanks for the review. The dockets pass, the issue with the `g` is that I often start typing "git" before the os has fully switch from the editor to the console. I should definitely be more careful, but they are tricky to catch as I have run all tests before I use git.

I'll try and implement the biplane now, otherwise I will end up forgetting.

you managed to break incidence_matrix:

```
sage: designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(16,2).incidence_matrix()
16 x 240 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```
it should be 16x120.

I have fixed the issue. However, I think I'm missing something when running the doctests.
Usually, I execute `sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.py`. How did you end up testing `strongly_regular_db`?
Do I need to run all doctests (`make ptest`) or is there a way to only test the dependencies?

in any event, it makes sense to implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem
to rule out sets of parameters for symmetric BIBDs - so far it is only done in Sage for 
pojective planes, see `projective_plane` in `src/sage/combinat/designs/block_design.py`

If I interpret the pyflakes report correctly, it complains about ".block_design.BlockDesign imported but unused".
That's wrong as `BlockDesign` is used at line 227. However, I think we could (and should) use `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` there.
I'm now running the doctests to make sure I'm not wrong.

I fixed the pycodestyle errors, but I personally believe that code (especially the 10 lines of if ... else if ...) looked better before.
