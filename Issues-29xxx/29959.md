looks great, adds a lot of nice stuff, but error messages need to be adjusted
(lambda=1 is fixed there I suppose):

(BIBD(79,13,2) is a largest known biplane (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design#Biplanes), so it would eventually be nice to have, but not on this ticket.

Thanks for the review. The dockets pass, the issue with the `g` is that I often start typing "git" before the os has fully switch from the editor to the console. I should definitely be more careful, but they are tricky to catch as I have run all tests before I use git.

I'll try and implement the biplane now, otherwise I will end up forgetting.

in any event, it makes sense to implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem
to rule out sets of parameters for symmetric BIBDs - so far it is only done in Sage for
