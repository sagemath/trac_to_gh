```
sage: AA['x','y'](1).factor()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'lc'
```
(This used to work in 8.9)

I'm guessing, but have not verified, that this was introduced in #25390 - multivariate factorization over QQbar

As far as I understand the problem comes from

```
Factorization([]).value()
```
being an integer. This is used in line 973 of `qqbar.py`

```
.../sage/rings/qqbar.py in _factor_multivariate_polynomial(self, f, proof)
    973         trial = Factorization(factorization).value()
    974 
--> 975         return Factorization(factorization, unit = f.lc() / trial.lc())
    976 
    977 
```
Which is where the error comes from.

I apologize for this.  Zero-degree polynomials are an obvious special case.  My test coverage just isn't what it should be.
