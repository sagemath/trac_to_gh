Currently radius, diameter and eccentricity computation methods are in generic_graph.py file. Since graph and digraph both have different algorithms for their computation. So it would be nice to have these method separately for graph and digraph in respective files.

* There is no need to add before the methods

```diff
+    # Eccentricity
+    # Radius
```

* This part is a perfect example of why we must add an eccentricity method in boost backend. It makes no sense to use boost to compute APSP, then return a dictionary of dictionaries with the distances (taking very long time to build and consuming a lot of memory) and finally get the largest value. We could directly return the eccentricities from boost.

```diff
+            if algorithm in ['Floyd-Warshall-Python', 'Floyd-Warshall-Cython', 'Johnson_Boost']:
+                dist_dict = self.shortest_path_all_pairs(by_weight, algorithm,
+                                                         weight_function,
+                                                         check_weight)[0]
+                algorithm = 'From_Dictionary'
```

Overall, I think this change ease the identification of missing methods and bad implementation choices. We must avoid as much as possible the use of `dist_dict`.
