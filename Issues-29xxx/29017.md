In SageMath 9.1.beta0:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Q = R.quo(x - 1)
sage: H = R.Hom(Q); H
Set of Homomorphisms from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring to Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
sage: h = R.hom(Q); h
Coercion map:
  From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
  To:   Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
sage: h.parent()
Set of Homomorphisms from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring to Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
```
The parent of `h` seems to be `H` at first sight.  However:

```
sage: h in H
False
sage: h.parent() == H
False
```
One can convert `h` to an element of `H`, but the result is bizarre:

```
sage: H(h)
Composite map:
  From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
  To:   Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
  Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
        then
          Coercion map:
          From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
          To:   Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
        then
          Identity endomorphism of Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in xbar over Integer Ring with modulus x - 1
```

Another symptom is the categories of the respect homspaces not agreeing:

```
sage: H.category()
Category of homsets of unital magmas and additive unital additive magmas
sage: h.parent().category()
Category of homsets of unital magmas and right modules over (euclidean domains and infinite enumerated sets and metric spaces) and left modules over (euclidean domains and infinite enumerated sets and metric spaces)
```
This is why the homsets are not the same, but I don't know what is causing this.

So the issue comes down to the fact that the coercion map from `R -> Q` is in the bigger category (which is not detected by default). More specifically, it comes from this line in `Q._coerce_map_from_`:

```
parent = Hom(R, self, category=self.category()._meet_(R.category()))
```
which the category part is

```
sage: Q.category()._meet_(R.category())
Category of commutative no zero divisors algebras over (euclidean domains and infinite enumerated sets and metric spaces)
```
However, if we reverse it, we get

```
sage: R.category()._meet_(Q.category())
Category of integral domains
```
So something is going wrong. My guess is it comes from the parameterization of the quotient ring's category:

```
sage: R.category()
Join of Category of unique factorization domains and Category of commutative algebras over (euclidean domains and infinite enumerated sets and metric spaces) and Category of infinite sets
sage: Q.category()
Category of commutative no zero divisors quotients of algebras over Integer Ring
```
