This might require some custom `__reduce__` methods unless we give the corresponding Cython classes a `__dict__`.

I don't have time right now to look into the code, but if I recall correctly, we have different (cython-)types for different actions. I.e., in each case it is hard-coded what the action does (for instance: "apply the ._lmul_ method of the left factor to the the right factor" or so).

From what I recall, the input data for any action is the pair (acting parent, acted upon parent). Hence, something like

```python
def __reduce__(self):
    return type(self), (the two parents)
```
should work.

```
TypeError: sage.categories.functor.Functor.__new__(sage.structure.coerce_actions.LeftModuleAction)
is not safe, use sage.structure.coerce_actions.LeftModuleAction.__new__()
```
and I don't know how to get around that with the current attempt (of course, I can fall back to custom `__reduce__` for each class). I also have another issue irregardless, the `weakref` in the `Action.US` slot, and I don't know how to get the object. Any ideas?

I think that's because actions have another memory layout. Looking at `coerce_action.pxd`, the problem is `ModuleAction`, so that would probably be the right spot to implement the custom `reduce`.

The fact that there's a weakref indicates the need for a custom reduce anyway, unless there's an established pattern recognized already (so that the reduce can exist higher up): the `US` slot is just a straight-up weakref, so you can dereference it with `self.US()`. If you get `None` than the acted-upon set was already garbage collected. Then the action is defunct and hence unpickleable.

You might be able to get away with the following on `Action`:

```
def __reduce__(self):
    return type(self), (self.G, self.underlying_set())
```
where `underlying_set` derefs the weakref and raises an error if defunct.

In the end, I think it's much safer to pickle these things with a call to the actual constructor than via a `new` and slot manipulations: it's much less implementation-dependent.

For the most part, I don't think these actions SHOULD be pickled anyway, but rather rediscovered. But because they should just be constructible from their actor and set, pickling them via a constructor is fairly straightforward.
