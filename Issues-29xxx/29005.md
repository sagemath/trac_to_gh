This causes a build error in some configurations, in particular when building on conda.

This is caused by overwriting `LDFLAGS` in `test/Makefile.am`, which should never be done. The `m4ri` package has the same defect.

We propose to apply a workaround similar to the one used in conda-forge (https://github.com/conda-forge/m4rie-feedstock/commit/dea9e9a33ccf951c2458ad53f9af3ed860f81fbf) until hopefully this is fixed upstream and a new release is available.

Keywords: m4ri, m4rie, LDFLAGS

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
