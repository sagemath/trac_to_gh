The vertex facet graph of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` only works for polyhedra of dimension at least one. With #29188 this makes it fail with for `Polyhedron_base` as well.

We fix this to return
- the `Digraph` on 0 vertices for the empty polyhedron and
- the `Digraph` on 1 vertex for the 0-dimensional polyhedron (it was misbehaved even before #29188).

We also "fix" the definition of facets to correspond to inequalities.
The `0`-dimensional polyhedron does not have facets in this case anymore.
(Before this ticket `n_facets` and `facets` would use different definitions of facets.)

I would say so. This is the "definition" from Günter Zieglers book "Lectures on Polytopes":

According to this the facets of the 0-dimensional polytope is the empty face. And I would say that this is reasonable. There is also an inequality defining that face: "(0,...,0)*x + 1 >= 0" (and the 0-vector might have lenght 0 according to ambient dimension).
This is how it is currently handled in most parts

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[0]])
sage: P.incidence_matrix()
[1]
sage: P.facets()
(A -1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^1,)
```

But of course, I might have be influential to "bug fixes" to make it behave like this.

Either definition is trouble:

- If you define facets by correspondence with irreducible inequalites than the empty face of the 0-dimensional polytope is not a facet. However it is certainly maximal.
- If you define the facets by maximality than you loose that correspondence.

And then comes the part that I already quoted.

But...

The facets not corresponding to inequalities is huge trouble. I myself made "mistakes" because of that. It seems much easier to define the facets as maximal non-trival faces with the empty face being trivial as well.

Than we have our irreducible inequality/facet correspondence. So I agree with you that this definition makes more sense.

But that would involve a few "fixes".

I'll also send a quick note to Günter Ziegler and see what he thinks, as he is still revising his new definition I believe.

This statement is exercise 2.15 (iii) and clearly doesn't fit to the definition. Then again we loose the vertex-facet correspondence for polarity.

Btw the polarity for 0-dimensional polyhedra is broken as well (but only for base ring `ZZ`):

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[]])
sage: P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.polar()
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^0
```

The reason for this is simple. `n_facets` is just an alias of `n_inequalities`.

Either way, we cannot have it consistent:
- The class of polyhedra without inequalities doesn't have any facets.
- Facets of polyhedra correspond to coatoms of their face lattice.
- vertices of polytopes correspond to facets of their polar/dual.
- (irredundant) Inequalities of polyhedra correspond to facets.

I personally think that we should define facets as the `d-1`-faces of `d`-polyhedra.

But I have no hard feelings either way. It just should be made clear that the 0-polytope cannot be made consistent in some ways.

Looking at the subsets of the polytope obtained through supporting hyperplanes gives faces. My interpretation here is that it is a combinatorial discussion to have "the whole polytope" and "the empty face" included in the poset of faces, as of course adding them makes it a lattice. This act of "adding the trivial faces" forces an eventual consideration of "non-proper/non-trivial" faces when defining anything...

Obviously, things go wrong in the following case:

  one removes the non-proper faces and obtains a poset which consists of an anti-chain (can only contain 1 or 2 elements in our case...)

In this case, "vertices" and "facets" are the same. Now you can even go wild and think about the actual object in space (not-being full-dimensional).

If you have one element only, i.e., you have a 0-dimensional polytope, then, what happens combinatorially is that the two elements are fusioned into one and yes, there isn't a bijection between actual maximal subsets given by supporting hyperplanes and the facet defining inequalities.

I would say that the 0-dimensional polytopes form "the exception that confirms the rule", as we say in French. Because of the fact that vertices and facet are the same, this creates this special situation, otherwise, the bijection should exist.

With this perspective, the next step is that

  one removes the non-proper faces and obtains an empty poset, for the empty polyhedron. Does the empty polyhedron have facets? I hope not, right?

The 0-dimensional polytope belongs to that family.

The other thing is that the vertex-facet-digraph relies on the fact that vertices are contained in facets or not. If facets are -1-dimensional and vertices 0-dimensional, this doesn't make any sense anymore.

To summarize this discussion, I think we agree that we should alter `facets` and maybe other methods, such that facets need to be proper faces of polyhedra. Where proper means neither empty nor full-dimensional. Should I open a seperate ticket for it?
