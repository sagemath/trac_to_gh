```
Autoconf scripts should be POSIX sh rather than bash, but there are a few bashisms in m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4 and m4/sage_spkg_enable.m4:

* The quoted newlines `$'\n'`
* The use of `VAR+=VALUE`

Some of these should be straightforward to fix. The format

```
SAGE_BUILT_PACKAGES+="    $SPKG_NAME \\"$'\n'
```

can be changed to

```
SAGE_BUILT_PACKAGES="$SAGE_BUILT_PACKAGES $SPKG_NAME"
```

since the newline is only used to make the `BUILT_PACKAGES` rule in the resulting Makefile look nice. Changing them to spaces doesn't change what the rule does. I'm not sure about

```
SAGE_PACKAGE_VERSIONS+="vers_$SPKG_NAME = $SPKG_VERSION"$'\n
```

and 

```
SAGE_PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES+="deps_$SPKG_NAME = $DEPS"$'\n'
```

though, because those are inserted verbatim into the Makefile as rules, and the newlines probably matter.

`bootstrap` already emits macro calls for many packages into `m4/sage_spkg_configures.m4`, of three types.
- m4_sinclude([build/pkgs/arb/spkg-configure.m4])
- SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ARB
- SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE([ninja_build], [optional])
Might as well emit another line for every package that creates whatever is needed in the Makefile.

Ultimately my goal is to not install any sage packages =)

I'll always need bash installed for other stuff, but ./configure is noticeably faster with dash. It may be a "micro-optimization" but half of what I do lately is re-run ./configure.

# Stolen from Gentoo
pkg_libs() {

                tr '\n' ';' | sed -e 's:;$::'
}
```
so that on ksh/openbsd I get `CVXOPT_BLAS_LIB="$(pkg_libs blas)"`
gets `;openblas` rather than `openblas`.
Note that 

```
(sage-buildsh) dima@sagemath:sagetrac-mirror$ pkg-config --libs-only-l blas
 -lopenblas
```
outputs a leading  space.

```
$ pkg-config --libs-only-l blas | sed -e 's:[ ]-l*\(pthread\|m\)\([ ]\|$\)::g' -e 's:[ ]*$::' | tr ' ' '\n'

-lopenblas
```
And so the latter outputs an extra blank line, leading to erroneous `;`.
It would suffice to remove the leading spaces from the output of `pkg-config`, say.

<a id='comment:33'></a>The latest commit lets me build cvxopt against the suitesparse SPKG using ksh.

Now that I'm familiar, I have a feeling that some more work is going to be needed on the suitesparse spkg-configure.m4 ticket to keep cvxopt working if suitesparse comes from the system. The new function I added should help if that proves true.
