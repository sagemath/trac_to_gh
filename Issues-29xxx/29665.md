This ticket adds an spkg-configure.m4 for cvxopt and various other python packages, to allow them to be used from the system (part of #27330).

These python packages are special because we currently use a python "venv" that is isolated from the system. Thus this ticket proceeds in several steps:

1. Add an `--enable-system-site-packages` flag to the top-level `./configure` script. When present, this will tell `sage-venv` that the venv it creates **should not** be isolated from the system.
2. Create a new macro that can detect python packages on the system. It should ensure that the version bounds in each python package's `install-requires.txt` are met.
3. Create the `spkg-configure.m4` files themselves, which should be relatively simple at that point.
4. Test everything thoroughly with various combinations of system and non-system python packages.

Platform-specific testing:
- for example `TARGETS_PRE="build-local" EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--enable-system-site-packages" tox -e docker-ubuntu-focal-standard -- build ptest`

What goes wrong? I just did a quick test (without this branch):

1. make cvxopt-clean
2. install system cvxopt
3. touch any file in sagelib names `*cvxopt*`
4. sage -b
5. run some tests on said cvxopt files

Behavior is unchanged as far as I can tell.

I wouldn't object to doing something like this, as it is clearly marked experimental.

However, be prepared for a long-term burden of maintenance regarding the declared version ranges. Lots of things can go wrong because the individual packages often have complicated version constraints.

Also the version constraints shouldn't be hardcoded in the spkg-configure.m4 file; instead, they should really be taken from `install-requires.txt`.
Likewise, don't use distutils, it's on its way out. Use a higher-level library that can check the requirements

Also, note `scandir` is gone after #32626

How so? The version information is maintained separately in `install-requires.txt`. And on Gentoo, most of these packages are already present and maintained by somebody else.

> Also the version constraints shouldn't be hardcoded in the spkg-configure.m4 file; instead, they should really be taken from `install-requires.txt`.


Done.

> Likewise, don't use distutils, it's on its way out. Use a higher-level library that can check the requirements


I'm using setuptools now, because I figure it (with its vendored "packaging") is more likely to be present than the "packaging" package itself.

> Also, note `scandir` is gone after #32626


Thanks, I dropped that one, and added a few more.

I think this is working as intended, but I still have to check it with python3 installed from an SPKG. The intention is that `--enable-system-site-packages` will only attempt to use packages from the system; not force it. If we're using python from the SPKG, the macro should always fail (this is in its documentation), and thus we'll use SPKGs for all of the python stuff.

I don't think we need to bail out with an error unless that process can somehow do the wrong thing?

We could make that possible with another option, like `--enable-user-site-packages`, that would undo the intentional breakage in sage-env:

```python
# Set PYTHONUSERBASE to avoid picking up non-Sage versions of
# Matplotlib, numpy, etc. See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19612.
#
# For more history (it used to be PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes which killed
# the ability to do "sage -pip install PACKAGE --user"), see
# http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14243 and
# http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18955.

if [ "$PYTHONUSERBASE" = "" ]; then
    PYTHONUSERBASE="$DOT_SAGE/local"
    export PYTHONUSERBASE
fi
```

The "system" site packages do work either way... you're just getting a different "system" with the SPKG than you would with `/usr/bin/python3`. Regardless, I only build with `--with-system-python3=force`, so I won't belabor this distinction.

I'll change `--enable-system-site-packages` to set `--with-system-python3=force`.

Not every package with an `install-requires.txt` requires `--enable-system-site-packages`. Hiding the package checks in two different places is also not great for maintainability; but more importantly, not every package uses the same check. Some have DEPCHECKs, and in the future I'm sure we'll need feature tests to ensure that e.g. matplotlib has support for our documented export formats.

In principle I'd rather hack the test setup than the build system if we have to do it for a release or two. But maybe my latest commit solves it without any collateral damage (I hope).

You sure setuptools isn't there? The new autoconf macro uses it to check for all of the other packages. If the whole thing is not crashing and burning (and if I did not flip an exit code somewhere...) setuptools is probably there.

Maybe something to do with `export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/src"` in pip's `spkg-install.in`.

I think you should change this to use the `sage-venv` script, like `m4/sage_check_python_for_venv.m4` does.

What does this script abstract, anyway? It's only called in two places so far (`build/make/Makefile.in` and `m4/sage_check_python_for_venv.m4`, and in both places we have access to the full path to the python interpreter and the flags that should be passed to `-m venv` (now called `$SAGE_VENV_FLAGS`).

If the only thing it does is handle `--symlinks`, then we could add `--symlinks` to `$SAGE_VENV_FLAGS` in `configure.ac` dependent upon the platform and avoid the separate script that just reimplements `-m venv`.

That part is probably fine but huge merge commits aren't very nice to review.

There are a bunch of other python packages with similar spkg-configures that I skipped initially. Once the `--enable-system-site-packages` mechanism works well enough to enable by default, I'll go back and replace them all at once with the trivial python spkg-configure that all of the other packages are using.

So both are supposedly running the symlink `/Users/runner/work/sage/sage/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-standard/local/bin/python3`, which should point to the real homebrew python3, by way of its being near the front of `PATH`. I'd love to know how it loses track of setuptools in the span of a few seconds, but I'm at a loss for ways to test it without a mac.

Something's gone wrong in the meantime. I'm now seeing cypari fail to cythonize.

cypari has a custom patch that in turn requires a custom patched cython, so I wouldn't expect it to work with the system cython... but I've got the cython SPKG installed. Must be somehow the system cython is getting used.

I think this explains all of the problems observed so far:

```
$ sage -c "print(sys.path)"
['/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin',
 '/usr/lib/python39.zip',
 '/usr/lib/python3.9',
 '/usr/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload',
 '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages', 
 '/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages']
```

I have been assuming that the venv would be searched before the system paths. When it isn't, installing an SPKG to override an unusable system package doesn't work.

That would have been a smart thing for me to check a few hours ago, but I saw a bunch of unrelated doctest failures and just clobbered my local checkout to confirm that #32836 occurs on the unmodified develop branch.

I'll switch back to this ticket eventually and make sure that we're not installing dependencies that shouldn't be. It would be especially counterproductive if pip was installing local copies of dependencies when the intention is to use those from the system.

Sort of. It actually winds up doing the right thing in most cases, but pollutes the logs and probably wastes a few seconds.

If the dependency is installed as a system package, an error gets thrown and the whole thing is retried with `--no-deps`, which makes it work. For example with system setuptools: 

```

```

I'm not sure what all it's doing, or how undesirable it is in the general case. It doesn't take noticeably longer, and everything works out in the end.

I suppose I'll add both `--no-deps` and `--ignore-installed`, but only when `--enable-system-site-packages` is on. If it ever becomes default, we'll just have to run a CI with `--disable-system-site-packages` to detect stale deps using that warning.

Yes, this seems to be the way forward.

Adding more and more packages (whatever is available on Gentoo) and things still look OK.

When you get a second, can you double-check if this should be "dateutil" or "python-dateutil"?

```
$ cat build/pkgs/dateutil/install-requires.txt 
dateutil >=2.8.1
```

It should be **python-dateutil** (https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), thanks for catching this.

Many of these `install-requires.txt` file are only decoration at the moment; only the `install-requires.txt` files of those packages that are named in files like `src/setup.cfg.m4` are used.

The test suite still passes with all of those packages installed on the system.

I did discover one more problem that we'll need to be aware of in the future. A lot of python packages have "automagic" dependencies that get used if they're available at runtime, rather than detected/configured at build-time. With python-3.9, for example, having an old version of ipyparallel installed will cause ipykernel to throw a deprecation warning that fails a doctest in `repl/ipython_kernel/kernel.py`.

We could try to address all of those (as they're reported) in `spkg-configure.m4`. Something like,

```
AC_DEFUN([SAGE_PYTHON_RUN_IFELSE], [dnl
cat >conftest.py <<SAGE__EOF
$1
SAGE__EOF
AS_IF(["${PYTHON_FOR_VENV}" conftest.py 1>&AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD 2>&AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD],[$2],[$3])
])
```

can be used to detect serious problems that are amenable to such a test. But for cosmetic issues like deprecation warnings I think we're better off just hiding them from the test suite. Or letting them fail (what's the point of the test suite?). Regardless, we can only ever hope to address the problems that exist when sage is being built. If I build sage and *then* install the old ipyparallel, there's nothing sage can do to stop me. That's not really a new problem of course, but it will show up more often with python packages than with C packages due to the prevalence of automagic features in python.

I should mention that I'm using a patch created from branch `u/mjo/ticket/29665` rather than the whole thing to make it more manageable for me. I hope I'm not missing anything important.

I'll let you know if anything goes wrong with doctesting. I'm now building using all possible system packages and python site packages available on void.

Oh, yes, I forgot: since pytest gives problems (see #31924) I had to disable it:

I don't know any other way to workaround this problem until #31924 is fixed.

For the record, in addition to what is in the current patch, I'm also using from system:
- `gmpy2-2.1.1` (I had to patch `install-requires.txt` since it currently requires `2.1.0rc1`)
- `sphinx-4.3.2` (I had to update it in void linux)
- `typing_extensions-3.10.0.2`

I also had to patch `ptyprocess/install-requires.txt` to allow `ptyprocess-0.7.0` since it currently requires `0.5.1` but this version seems to work ok.

Of all the python packages added by this patch only three were not available for me on void linux: `cvxopt`, `importlib_resources` and `debugpy`, everything else was tested (note that `debugpy` is optional now)
