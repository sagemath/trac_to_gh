We reduce the runtime dependency of `sage` on `sage-env-config`.

We query `sage-config` (installed by `sage_conf`, which has a dependency on our `python3` package) for the values of `SAGE_LOCAL` and `SAGE_ROOT`. `sage-config` must be in the same directory as $0.

This allows the installed `sage` script to be invoked directly from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` in an environment without `SAGE_...` variables, restoring what was previously implemented in #25486.

Also, we move sourcing of `sage-env-config` (but not `sage-env`!) earlier in the `sage` script. 
This is so that commands such as `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage --root` work correctly.

Follow-up tickets:
- #30888 resolve symlinks so it even works for symlinks to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage`
- #30013 set `SAGE_VENV` too
- remove the build-time dependency of the sage distribution on `src/bin/sage-env-config`
