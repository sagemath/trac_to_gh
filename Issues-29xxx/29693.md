In 2017 some .pxd files in the sagelib were cleaned up and various exports removed. 

In my case having access to some of these removed functions allows my customized canonical isomorph-free generation of graphs to run at 'cython speed'. I suggest that some of these exports are re-added. 

In particular I want `all_children_are_equivalent, compare_graphs, refine_by_degree, search_tree` to be re-added to `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_graphs.pxd`. This allows me to implement my own `search_tree`-like functions.

I'm currently stuck on windows and setting up a development environment in order to write a patch is a daunting task, sorry. I tracked down the relevant commit on the github:
