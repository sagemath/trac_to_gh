When adding references, you sometimes have to `make doc-clean` and rebuild all the full documentation.

If I understand well, you have rebased the ticket on #28351, right ? If so, you must add the dependency in the appropriate field.

Please use the memory allocator, as is done in 2Dsweep. This way, allocated arrays will be freed before returning the result. You also have to ensure that you free the bit sets.

Instead of `tmp = max([simple_BFS(g, j, distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen) for j in Bb[i]])`, you should make a for loop to stop iteration if the diameter is proved.

More generally, I don't understand why you use `Bf` and `Bb`. The waiting list gives you the order of the vertices. The last vertex in waiting list is at largest distance from the source. So you have to iterate from last to first vertex.

I did the stuff with the `Bf` and `Bb` for my implementation to resemble the pseudo code mentioned in  https://courses.cs.ut.ee/MTAT.03.238/2014_fall/uploads/Main/diameter.pdf. 
\\
But I will try to do it using the reversed waiting list, since that would also be consistent with the existing undirected iFUB implementation in sage.

I tried it using just the waiting list only

```
    eccb_m = simple_BFS(g_rev, m, layer_1, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
    for i in range(n):
        order_1[i] = waiting_list[n - i - 1]
        

    eccf_m = simple_BFS(g, m, layer_2, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
    for i in range(n):
        order_2[i] = waiting_list[n - i - 1]

    i = 0
    LB = max(LB,eccf_m,eccb_m)
    
    while(layer_1[order_1[i]]+layer_2[order_2[i]] > LB and i<n ):
        tmp =  simple_BFS(g, order_1[i], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
        tmp_1=  simple_BFS(g_rev, order_2[i], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
        i+=1
        LB = max(tmp,tmp_1,LB)        
```

And although the above code is giving correct answers, there is a degradation in performance compared to my previous approach(more bfs calls on an average).

The "error" is that you do BFS from vertices that may be at different forward/backward distances from m. That's the interest of using Bf and Bb. However, an alternative is to do something like that (not completely sure of the bounds).

```
d = max(eccb_m, eccf_m)
i1 = 0
i2 = 0
while (layer_1[order_1[i1]]+layer_2[order_2[i2]] > LB and d > 0):

        LB = max(LB, simple_BFS(g, order_1[i1], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen))
        i1 += 1
    if i2 < n and layer_1[order_2[i2]] >= d:
        LB = max(LB, simple_BFS(g, order_2[i2], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen))
