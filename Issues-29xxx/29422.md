When adding references, you sometimes have to `make doc-clean` and rebuild all the full documentation.

If I understand well, you have rebased the ticket on #28351, right ? If so, you must add the dependency in the appropriate field.

Please use the memory allocator, as is done in 2Dsweep. This way, allocated arrays will be freed before returning the result. You also have to ensure that you free the bit sets.

Instead of `tmp = max([simple_BFS(g, j, distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen) for j in Bb[i]])`, you should make a for loop to stop iteration if the diameter is proved.

More generally, I don't understand why you use `Bf` and `Bb`. The waiting list gives you the order of the vertices. The last vertex in waiting list is at largest distance from the source. So you have to iterate from last to first vertex.

I tried it using just the waiting list only

```
    eccb_m = simple_BFS(g_rev, m, layer_1, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
    for i in range(n):
        order_1[i] = waiting_list[n - i - 1]
        

    eccf_m = simple_BFS(g, m, layer_2, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
    for i in range(n):
        order_2[i] = waiting_list[n - i - 1]

    i = 0
    LB = max(LB,eccf_m,eccb_m)
    
    while(layer_1[order_1[i]]+layer_2[order_2[i]] > LB and i<n ):
        tmp =  simple_BFS(g, order_1[i], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
        tmp_1=  simple_BFS(g_rev, order_2[i], distances, NULL, waiting_list, seen)
        i+=1
        LB = max(tmp,tmp_1,LB)        
```

And although the above code is giving correct answers, there is a degradation in performance compared to my previous approach(more bfs calls on an average).

Madhav
