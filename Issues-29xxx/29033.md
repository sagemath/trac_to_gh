With #27824 it is possible to create a venv over an existing Python 3.7 instead of building the python3 spkg.  

This is designed to work with Python 3.7 (and < 3.8) since that's what's currently used by sage-the-distribution and is best-tested.

However, it turns out an existing Python 3.6 can work just fine as the minimum Python version with a few small fixes (sage-the-distribution used Python 3.6 until last year, so the degree to which we diverged from supporting it was minimal).

This would be a nice-to-have, as it would speed up the build on various distributions that we still support: 
- `centos-8` (3.6.8), 
- `fedora-26` (3.6.5, but has 3.7.0 too), https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/743789829 - clean doctests, but exceeds 6h
- `fedora-27` (3.6.6, but has 3.7.0 too), https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/743789883 - clean except for sympow, exceeds 6h
- `fedora-28` (3.6.5, but has 3.7.3 too), https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/743789896 - with `gcc_spkg`, build errors for gmpy2, cython, pynac
- `opensuse-leap-15.0` (3.6.5), `-15.1` (3.6.9), `-15.2` (3.6.10), 
but not (because python3 is too old):
- `debian-stretch` (oldstable) (3.5.3),
- `ubuntu-xenial` (3.5.2)
and not (because a dependency of python3 is too old):
- `centos-7` (3.6.8): `sqlite` is too old (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/743789990)

(All this is according to https://repology.org/project/python/versions as of 2020-06-05, not verified.)

Maybe since Sage is less tested with 3.6, there could be a warning against using it.

Replying to [@antonio-rojas](#comment%3A21):
> C.UTF-8 locale is a Debian-specific thing (and maybe Fedora). Please don't assume that it is available.

Sorry about that, I didn't realize that Gentoo's glibc was patched (the patches are in an unusual place). It looks like discussion is still ongoing for glibc:

https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-June/115224.html

Musl, on the other hand, already supports it I think?

https://wiki.musl-libc.org/functional-differences-from-glibc.html

In any case, we should probably revert to `C` in the meantime.

This has introduced an unfortunate bug related to a weird search order in `AC_PATH_PROGS_FEATURE_CHECK()`, which has the outer loop over `PATH` entries.
Thus, a python on the list `[python.foo python.baz ....]` of pythons that comes first in `PATH` and has all the features will be picked, not the first python on the list.

As modifying `PATH` to put the best python 1st might be error-prone (think about Conda, Homebrew, etc), this should be fixed.

This is of course an autoconf bug, too, as `AC_PATH_PROGS()` has a sane order, ie. its outer loop is over the list entries.

Follow up regarding `centos-7`:

After #30559, `sqlite` is no longer the problem, but python3 is still not accepted on this system because of `zlib` -> `libpng`:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG zlib...
checking for inflateEnd in -lz... yes
checking zlib.h usability... yes
checking zlib.h presence... yes
checking for zlib.h... yes
checking for LIBPNG... no
checking for inflateValidate in -lz... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG zlib
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG libpng...
checking installing zlib? ... yes; install libpng as well
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG libpng
```
