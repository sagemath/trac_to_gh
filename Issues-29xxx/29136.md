For doctesting rich output textual representations, functions like `ascii_art()`, `unicode_art()` are commonly used. So I don't see a room for `display_context` there.

For the documentation of `pretty_print`, `%display` magic should be used rather than `display_context` since that is what Sage users use to change preferences. Since `%display` errors out in doctests, we need to tag it `# not tested` 

In conclusion, I don't see any real necessity or benefit of `display_context` in Sage.

I have implemented this by hiding the actual change of the preferences in a `TESTS:` block which is not shown in the documentation. An alternative would be to use `get_test_shell()`, which is commonly done for such IPython specific features. This would have the advantage that it does not use `# not tested`, but makes the documentation a bit harder to understand.
