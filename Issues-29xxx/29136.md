`display` sounds perhaps a bit too active. I really associate it with `print` and `show` and would expect it to do something similar. Indeed in

Yes, that should work, but one also needs to set it back to the default value after the doctest, as it is not automatically reset by the doctesting framework. However, this would also add a pattern to the documentation that is not suitable for general use outside of doctests (in contrast to the context manager). Outside of tests, one would have to restore the previous value, not the default, and wrap everything in try-except, which is almost exactly what the context manager accomplishes.

I admit the benefits are small. If you prefer, we can make this ticket just about the documentation. Otherwise, if we keep `display_context`, I will look for other places in the documentation that could make use of it.

Okay. How about outside of the doctesting framework? I myself do not use rich text output much. But if you do and find yourself frequently changing text preferences, doesn't it make sense to import `display_context` into the global namespace so that you do not need to import it in each session?

For doctesting rich output textual representations, functions like `ascii_art()`, `unicode_art()` are commonly used. So I don't see a room for `display_context` there.

For the documentation of `pretty_print`, `%display` magic should be used rather than `display_context` since that is what Sage users use to change preferences. Since `%display` errors out in doctests, we need to tag it `# not tested` 

In conclusion, I don't see any real necessity or benefit of `display_context` in Sage.

I have implemented this by hiding the actual change of the preferences in a `TESTS:` block which is not shown in the documentation.
