On the platform `local-homebrew-macos` defined by `tox.ini`, running on a `macos-latest` system as defined in https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources, a branch that includes #27824 (spkg-configure.m4 for python3) leads to the following error with `pplpy`, as seen in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/538432631:

Cleaning up...
```

Same kind of error with scipy, kiwisolver, fpylll.

Full logs can be downloaded at the above link.

To test locally, using #29104 + #27824, remove all python3 from the homebrew in /usr/local 
and run

```
tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- V=0 pplpy
```
With #29417, it is:

```
tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3_xcode -- V=0 pplpy
```

fbissey@itsv-frb15 ~ % xcrun --help
Usage: xcrun [options] <tool name> ... arguments ...

Find and execute the named command line tool from the active developer
directory.

The active developer directory can be set using `xcode-select`, or via the
DEVELOPER_DIR environment variable. See the xcrun and xcode-select manual
pages for more information.

Options:
  -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
  --version                   show the xcrun version
  -v, --verbose               show verbose logging output
  --sdk <sdk name>            find the tool for the given SDK name
  --toolchain <name>          find the tool for the given toolchain
  -l, --log                   show commands to be executed (with --run)
  -f, --find                  only find and print the tool path
  -r, --run                   find and execute the tool (the default behavior)
  -n, --no-cache              do not use the lookup cache
  -k, --kill-cache            invalidate all existing cache entries
  --show-sdk-path             show selected SDK install path
  --show-sdk-version          show selected SDK version
  --show-sdk-build-version    show selected SDK build version
  --show-sdk-platform-path    show selected SDK platform path
  --show-sdk-platform-version show selected SDK platform version
```
Is it just a stupid `--` versus `-`?

There was already a test that the system python (in the venv) is able to build a C extension.
The change tightens this check by imposing the configured `CC` (and `CXX`) values -- because this is what the actual build will be running.
It also adds the same test for building a C++ 11 extension.

Re polymake, here is the error:

It's probably the old problem of not having the right perl modules present and Sage's polymake build system failing to recognize that. The instructions in polymake's SPKG.txt are no longer valid.

In any case, the polymake problems should be dealt with at #29054.
