With #29633, we now generate a full list of packages that Sage uses (with links to documentation - see #27495)
for the reference manual from information in `build/pkgs/*/SPKG.rst` (which used to be `SPKG.txt`).

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the `SPKG.rst` files and the scripts that transform them to generate a part of the Sage reference manual.

1. If other sources have better information than what is in `build/pkgs`, update `build/pkgs` accordingly. (See https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWiki)

   - (done:) https://github.com/sagemath/website/blob/master/conf/packages.yaml (which is used for generating http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html)
   - (done:) https://wiki.sagemath.org/spkg (another incomplete list of packages)
   - `src/doc/en/installation/standard_packages.rst` (yet another incomplete list of packages)

2. Delete/archive the obsolete other sources.

   - https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/212 removes `packages.yaml`
   - https://wiki.sagemath.org/spkg has been cleared

3. Change the titles of the `SPKG.rst` files to use the format "`spkg_name`: Short description". This will improve the table of contents shown in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/index.html, which the Sage website is pointing to after https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/212

4. Extend `build/bin/sage-spkg-info` and use it to format additional information from `build/pkgs/SPKG/`. 

5. In addition to the full alphabetical list of packages, also show the standard packages, the optional packages, and the experimental packages separately.

Follow-up:
- #31136 Rename SPKGs to match their PyPI name
