This patch, applied by #13579 ("Python sys.path security risk") 7 years ago was never accepted in upstream Python. We do not bother to do the same in python3; and it causes build problems (#29367).

Related tickets:
- #25358 Test safe directory without python subprocess
- #26457 Do not depend on a patched Python

Depends on #25358
