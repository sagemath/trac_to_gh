If you want to try to revive that, you can. It can be done on #25358, with this ticket as a prerequisite, since one of the main obstacles there was the patched Python. Once we remove this patch to Python, the current incarnation of `test_safe_directory` is no longer relevant, as far as I can tell.

That ticket had completely stalled, though.
