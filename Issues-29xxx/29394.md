This patch, applied by #13579 ("Python sys.path security risk") 7 years ago was never accepted in upstream Python. We do not bother to do the same in python3; and it causes build problems (#29367).

Related tickets:
- #25358 Test safe directory without python subprocess
- #26457 Do not depend on a patched Python

Depends on #25358

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A9):

If you want to try to revive that, you can. It can be done on #25358, with this ticket as a prerequisite, since one of the main obstacles there was the patched Python. Once we remove this patch to Python, the current incarnation of `test_safe_directory` is no longer relevant, as far as I can tell.
