This simplifies the `_coerce_map_from_()` methods and improves performance.

Example:

```
sage: P = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: S = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 'y')
sage: u = QQ(3/4)
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit P(u)
The slowest run took 156.00 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 15.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit S(u)
The slowest run took 104.03 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 65.1 µs per loop
```
After:

```
sage: %timeit P(u)
The slowest run took 31.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 5: 4.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit S(u)
The slowest run took 19.11 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 40 µs per loop
```
