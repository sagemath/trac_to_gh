This issue is split off from #29400. The command `cot(1 + I).n()` gives a `TypeError`:

```
sage: cot(1 + I).n()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/dmorris/Documents/misc/Programs/sage3/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.numerical_approx (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:34715)()

   6055         else:

   6057 
   6058         # Important -- the  we get might not be a valid output for numerical_approx in

TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
There is no such error for `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sec`, or `csc`.

I believe this can be fixed by renaming the `cotan` method of the `ComplexNumber` class to `cot`, and I will upload a PR soon.

I changed the name of the `cotan` method of the `ComplexNumber` class to `cot`. This eliminates the error:

```
sage: cot(1 + I).n()
0.217621561854403 - 0.868014142895925*I
```
For consistency, I made the same change to the class `MPComplexNumber`, which I think is the only other occurrence of a `cotan` function in the sage source. To preserve backwards compatibility, I added `cotan` as an alias for each of these methods.
