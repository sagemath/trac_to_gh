This is a follow-up on #28788, which implemented the current version of the "Build status for each package" displayed at the end of configure.

For an optional package that is not installed already, it displays a message like the following:

```
e_antic-0.1.5: does not support check for system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-e_antic" to install
```
In this ticket, we change the message if the package has been configured to be installed.

To this end, we introduce the variable `SAGE_ENABLE_<SPKG>` for each optional/experimental SPKG.  We also `AC_SUBST` these variables for future use by the build system.
