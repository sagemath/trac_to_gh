We can test if `SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` is "sage-buildsh" to check if the user ran `sage --buildsh`. Although should we be doing `export SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` in `src/bin/sage`? It's currently only exported if using `--buildsh`, not if using `--sh`.

How else do we test this? Check to see if SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_ROOT, and other variables are set?

In any case, a heuristic here should be fine. This will be a rare mistake, and nothing too bad happens. Exporting `SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX=sage-sh` and then checking for it in the configure script looks like it will do the trick.
