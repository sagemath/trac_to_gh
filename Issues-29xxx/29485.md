We can test if `SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` is "sage-buildsh" to check if the user ran `sage --buildsh`. Although should we be doing `export SAGE_SHPROMPT_PREFIX` in `src/bin/sage`? It's currently only exported if using `--buildsh`, not if using `--sh`.

How else do we test this? Check to see if SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_ROOT, and other variables are set?
