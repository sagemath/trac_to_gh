<a id='comment:8'></a>In other methods, we use `MemoryAllocator`. It will not be faster than what you did, but it eases the release of memory (the object do it for you). In particular, it will fix a problem of your code: you forgot to release memory before returning the result.

For bitsets however, you have to take care of the release of the memory.

`If the forward eccentricity of the source1 is infinite` -> `If the forward eccentricity of source_1 is infinite`

After each BFS, you must check if the diameter is infinite or not to stop as soon as possible.

why `2-Dsweep` and not `2Dsweep` ?

<a id='comment:16'></a>- You should use latex mode for all variables in this part as well.

```diff
+    eccentricity of `vb` and s as respective vertex.
+    This method returns (LB, s, m, d), where LB is best found lower bound on
+    diameter, s is vertex whose forward/backward eccentricity is LB, d is vertex
+    at a distance LB from/to s, m is vertex at distance LB/2 from/to both s and
+    d.
```

- Please add a test block with a small example.

- you have not defined `s` and `d`. Also, instead of `LB1` and `LB2` (that are not defined), you could define a unique variable `LBm`  for both cases.

- may be `rev_g` should be an input parameter of the method to avoid building multiple times this graph in case the method is used as a sub-routine of another one.

- Done\\
Also, I have done the following.\\

- In case of weakly connected digraph, it was throwing an overflow error. In line 1413 of method `diameter`

```diff
- cdef int LB
+ cdef uint32_t LB
```

- To avoid warning of signed and unsigned variables comparing, in line 1378 of method `diameter` 

```diff
- cdef int n = G.order()
+ cdef uint32_t n = G.order()
```

- and some minor doc fixing

Actually, in other methods such as `2sweep` , `multi-sweep`etc there were no test blocks. That's why, I added that test in `diameter`.\\
Now, I have moved that test block from `diameter` to `diameter_lower_bound_2Dsweep`.
