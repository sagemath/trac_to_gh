In other methods, we use `MemoryAllocator`. It will not be faster than what you did, but it eases the release of memory (the object do it for you). In particular, it will fix a problem of your code: you forgot to release memory before returning the result.

For bitsets however, you have to take care of the release of the memory.

`If the forward eccentricity of the source1 is infinite` -> `If the forward eccentricity of source_1 is infinite`

After each BFS, you must check if the diameter is infinite or not to stop as soon as possible.

why `2-Dsweep` and not `2Dsweep` ?

Yeah, I agree to that. But is there any way to avoid checking the same `if-condition` multiple times, it just makes the code looks messy.
