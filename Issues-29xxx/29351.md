In other methods, we use `MemoryAllocator`. It will not be faster than what you did, but it eases the release of memory (the object do it for you). In particular, it will fix a problem of your code: you forgot to release memory before returning the result.

For bitsets however, you have to take care of the release of the memory.

`If the forward eccentricity of the source1 is infinite` -> `If the forward eccentricity of source_1 is infinite`

After each BFS, you must check if the diameter is infinite or not to stop as soon as possible.

why `2-Dsweep` and not `2Dsweep` ?

So there is no need to check that again for `source_2`.

Actually, in other methods such as `2sweep` , `multi-sweep`etc there were no test blocks. That's why, I added that test in `diameter`.\\
Now, I have moved that test block from `diameter` to `diameter_lower_bound_2Dsweep`.
