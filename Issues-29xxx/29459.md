The restriction in the function `NonisotropicOrthogonalPolarGraph` in `graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py` to some specific small values in `q` is not necessary. The current code is as follows:

```
    if m % 2 == 0:
        if q in [2, 3]:
            G = _orthogonal_polar_graph(m, q, sign=sign, point_type=[1])
        else:
            raise ValueError("for m even q must be 2 or 3")
    elif not perp is None:
        if q == 5:
            G = _orthogonal_polar_graph(m, q, point_type=\
                [-1,1] if sign=='+' else [2,3] if sign=='-' else [])
            dec = ",perp"
        else:
            raise ValueError("for perp not None q must be 5")
```

One can easily make this work for general `q`. For `q` odd and m even, the `point_type` should be the set of nonzero squares in `GF(q)`. For `q` odd and `m` odd, the two point types are either the set of all squares (so `[-1,1]` for `q=5`) and all non-squares (so `[2, 3]` for `q=5`). For `q` even, one can use the trace to do determine the `point_type` in a similar way.

Note that in the general case the graphs are no longer strongly regular.
