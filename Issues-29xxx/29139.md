This manifests itself in `%%cython` magic, e.g.

```
sage: %%cython
....: include "sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi"
```
leads to 

```
RuntimeError: Error compiling Cython file:

    if size <= 0:
        raise ValueError("bitset capacity must be greater than 0")

    bits.size = size
    bits.limbs = (size - 1) / (8 * sizeof(mp_limb_t)) + 1
                                                     ^

/home/dimpase/sage-src/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi:84:54: Cannot assign type 'double' to 'mp_size_t'

```

this was reported on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/akv4XU-vcbo/MPGYETpRAQAJ)

We fix this by setting `cdivision=True` as a default for loading cython. This is the same as when compiling sage.

I looked into all `.pxi` files. However the files with corresponding header are really hard to test, e.g.

`/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template_header.pxi`
`/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`

I got the test down to a few warnings but that was about it. Also it is annoying to search for the correct things to import first, as some of the `pxi` files assume lots of imports already.

<a id='comment:11'></a>The issue can be reproduced by cythonizing this file

```
# file division.pyx
cdef int a = -6
cdef int b = 5
cdef int c = 0

```
with this setup using `sage -python`:

```
from distutils.core import Extension
from Cython.Build import cythonize
ext = Extension("division", sources=["division.pyx"])
res = cythonize([ext], compiler_directives=dict(language_level=3))
```

The problem is a missing compiler directive `cdivision=True`, which enforces C semantics instead of Python semantics for division. The [Cython docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#compiler-directives) say:

> cdivision (True / False)

>
> If set to False, Cython will adjust the remainder and quotient operators C types to match those of Python ints (which differ when the operands have opposite signs) and raise a ZeroDivisionError when the right operand is 0.

I am rather surprised that this does not mention anything about the division operator returning double instead of int with Python 3, so I can only assume that this tries to match Python 3 semantics now.

The directive is also set in `src/setup.py` for all of Sage, so I suggest to solve this by setting it in `sage.misc.cython` as well (and the other compiler directives might be worth checking, too):

```diff
--- a/src/sage/misc/cython.py
+++ b/src/sage/misc/cython.py
@@ -315,7 +315,8 @@ def cython(filename, verbose=0, compile_message=False,
                     libraries=standard_libs,
                     library_dirs=standard_libdirs)

-    directives = dict(language_level=sys.version_info[0])
+    directives = dict(language_level=sys.version_info[0],
+                      cdivision=True)

     try:
         # Change directories to target_dir so that Cython produces the correct
```

In the example above, the value of `c` changes from `-2` (Python floor) to `-1` (C truncation towards 0).

The compiler directive can also be set directly:

```
sage: %%cython
....: # cython: cdivision=True
....: include "sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi"
```

I think it is more reasonable to do this change to cython files manually with `# cython: cdivision=True` as mentioned above. This includes not doing this change to *.pxi files, as the compiler directive is just pasted as well when including the file.

The directive is already enabled for all of Sage, so I was suggesting to do the same for the `%%cython`-magic, for compatibility with the Sage library. Of course, Sage's default (`cdivision=True`) is different from Cython's default. We can only adhere to one of them when setting the default for the `%%cython`-magic, and both values have their justification. For use with code from the Sage library, it is desirable to enable it, but for use with external Cython code, this can be unexpected as it is not Cython's default.

One could argue that it is the responsibility of the user of the `%%cython`-magic to ensure that those compiler directives are set that are needed for the included code.

This also extends to other directives. For example, Sage is compiled with `language_level="3str"`, but the `%%cython`-magic sets it to `2` or `3` depending on the Python version. I think it is wrong to assume that including code from the Sage library will just work without adjusting this setting.

Indeed, we could add all compiler directives to the top of every Cython file. I am not sure if this is desirable from a maintainability point of view, as this duplicates code in a lot of places. Though, at least this has the advantage that one cannot accidentally compile a file with the wrong semantics.

To be honest, I do not know what the best thing to do here is.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Thanks. I finally understood the problem, I think.

In bitset.pxi this change is certainly justified as there is a check that `not size <= 0` just before that. Other than that there is only floor division in `bitset.pxi` (and given the nature of that file, it's not surprising). So this can be included no matter whether `cdivision` is set true or not. `binary_matrix.pxi` doesn't do any division and just includes `bitset.pxi`.

`point_c.pxi` does exactly one division and that is of floats.

`algebra_elements.pxi` does exactly one floor division.
