This manifests itself in `%%cython` magic, e.g.

```
sage: %%cython
....: include "sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi"
```
leads to 

```
RuntimeError: Error compiling Cython file:

...
    """
    if size <= 0:
        raise ValueError("bitset capacity must be greater than 0")

    bits.size = size
    bits.limbs = (size - 1) / (8 * sizeof(mp_limb_t)) + 1
                                                     ^

/home/dimpase/sage-src/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi:84:54: Cannot assign type 'double' to 'mp_size_t'
...
```

this was reported on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/akv4XU-vcbo/MPGYETpRAQAJ)

We fix this by setting `cdivision=True` as a default for loading cython. This is the same as when compiling sage.

As mentioned, I found a few more instances.

I looked into all `.pxi` files. However the files with corresponding header are really hard to test, e.g.

`/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template_header.pxi`
`/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_template.pxi`

It is assumed that the header is included into a `pxd` file and the other into the corresponding `pyx` file. So I guess it is really not meant to work with `%%cython`.

I got the test down to a few warnings but that was about it. Also it is annoying to search for the correct things to import first, as some of the `pxi` files assume lots of imports already.

The issue can be reproduced by cythonizing this file

```
# file division.pyx
cdef int a = -6
cdef int b = 5
cdef int c = 0
c = a / b
```
with this setup using `sage -python`:

```
from distutils.core import Extension
from Cython.Build import cythonize
ext = Extension("division", sources=["division.pyx"])
res = cythonize([ext], compiler_directives=dict(language_level=3))
```

The problem is a missing compiler directive `cdivision=True`, which enforces C semantics instead of Python semantics for division. The [Cython docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#compiler-directives) say:

> cdivision (True / False)

>
> If set to False, Cython will adjust the remainder and quotient operators C types to match those of Python ints (which differ when the operands have opposite signs) and raise a ZeroDivisionError when the right operand is 0. This has up to a 35% speed penalty. If set to True, no checks are performed. See CEP 516. Default is False.


I am rather surprised that this does not mention anything about the division operator returning double instead of int with Python 3, so I can only assume that this tries to match Python 3 semantics now.

The directive is also set in `src/setup.py` for all of Sage, so I suggest to solve this by setting it in `sage.misc.cython` as well (and the other compiler directives might be worth checking, too):

```diff
--- a/src/sage/misc/cython.py
+++ b/src/sage/misc/cython.py
@@ -315,7 +315,8 @@ def cython(filename, verbose=0, compile_message=False,
                     libraries=standard_libs,

-    directives = dict(language_level=sys.version_info[0])

+                      cdivision=True)

     try:
         # Change directories to target_dir so that Cython produces the correct
```

In the example above, the value of `c` changes from `-2` (Python floor) to `-1` (C truncation towards 0).

The compiler directive can also be set directly:

```
sage: %%cython
....: # cython: cdivision=True
....: include "sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi"
```

The directive is already enabled for all of Sage, so I was suggesting to do the same for the `%%cython`-magic, for compatibility with the Sage library. Of course, Sage's default (`cdivision=True`) is different from Cython's default. We can only adhere to one of them when setting the default for the `%%cython`-magic, and both values have their justification.

This also extends to other directives. For example, Sage is compiled with `language_level="3str"`, but the `%%cython`-magic sets it to `2` or `3` depending on the Python version. I think it is wrong to assume that including code from the Sage library will just work without adjusting this setting.

Indeed, we could add all compiler directives to the top of every Cython file. I am not sure if this is desirable from a maintainability point of view, as this duplicates code in a lot of places. Though, at least this has the advantage that one cannot accidentally compile a file with the wrong semantics.

To be honest, I do not know what the best thing to do here is.

I checked that I added floor division only in files, where floor division was used at least once before. So I think those changes should be made in order to make those files consistent.

Thanks. I finally understood the problem, I think.

In bitset.pxi this change is certainly justified as there is a check that `not size <= 0` just before that. Other than that there is only floor division in `bitset.pxi` (and given the nature of that file, it's not surprising). So this can be included no matter whether `cdivision` is set true or not. `binary_matrix.pxi` doesn't do any division and just includes `bitset.pxi`.

`point_c.pxi` does exactly one division and that is of floats.

`algebra_elements.pxi` does exactly one floor division.

Replying to [gh-mwageringel](#comment%3A18):

Sorry if this was not very clear before. This is the effect of `cdivision` on the division operations of integers:

| cdivision     | False         | True                            |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| `/`           | true division   |  truncating division towards 0    |
| `//`          | floor division  |  truncating division towards 0    |

Since sagelib is compiled with `cdivision=True`, the `//` operator is a priori different from floor division (which would be used by the cython magic).

Personally, I do not feel comfortable with giving this a positive review as compiling a file with two different `cdivision` directives does not make sense to me. If anyone else wants to review this though, please go ahead.

Thanks for the comment.

However, the problem is not clear to me. (I'm totally fine with removing any tests from the ticket.)

At least in `bitset.pxi` there is only division of positive integers and anything else doesn't make sense. So in this case `/` with `cdivivision=True` and `//` either way are the same, aren't they?

The other thing we could do is just leave a comment in the beginning of `bitset.pxi` that one should set `cdivision=True` in order to include this file.

I'm seeing the advantage of the solution you suggested in comment 11.

If I load a file into sage, I want it to behave exactly like if it would have been compiled in sage from the start. At the moment this is not the case.

However, we would probably have to post a thread on sage-devel to see if anyone speaks up against it.
