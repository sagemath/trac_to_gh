sage: a = QQbar((1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2))
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(8))
sage: b = R(a)  # segmentation fault
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
```

However, calling `simplify()` changes the internal representation and makes this example work:

```
sage: a = QQbar((1/2*I + 1/2)*sqrt(2))
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(CyclotomicField(8))
sage: a._descr
<sage.rings.qqbar.ANBinaryExpr object at 0x1d4a5a668>
sage: a.simplify()
sage: a._descr
a where a^4 + 1 = 0 and a in 0.7071067811865475? + 0.7071067811865475?*I
sage: R(a)
(zeta8)
```


Keywords: qqbar
