This ticket adds the method `apply_map` to the class `TensorField`, which applies a function to the coordinate expressions of all components of a tensor field in a given vector frame.
This allows operations like factorization, expansion, simplification or substitution to be performed on the components.

Such a method has been requested in e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42107/basic-work-on-tensor-components/ and was discussed again during [Sage Days 107](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days107).

No, not at all. Thanks for pointing out this. 
In the context of tensor fields, `apply_map` may sound a little bit too vague (for instance, it may evoke a pull back operation associated with a map between manifolds). Would  `apply_map_components` be more appropriate?

The vagueness also applies to vectors/matrices where map can also refer to a morphism between vector spaces. I am not a big fan of the terminology but to my mind, consistency is the best option for the Sage interface as a whole. This consistency didcatorship includes as an option changing `apply_map` to something better.

`apply_map` is redundant. I would just have called it map because of the already existing Python function

```
sage: list(map(lambda x: x^2, range(4)))
[0, 1, 4, 9]
```

I just want to mention that matrices also have a method `map_coefficients` which is very similar, coming from modules with basis. It is supposed to work with an endofunction on the coefficient ring, however it seems to be broken for matrices:

```
sage: matrix.identity(2).map_coefficients(lambda x: x+1)
...
KeyError: 1
```
As `apply_map` does not require an endofunction, it has a more general notion, though.

That's a good point.
