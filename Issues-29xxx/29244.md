This ticket adds the method `apply_map` to the class `TensorField`, which applies a function to the coordinate expressions of all components of a tensor field in a given vector frame.
This allows operations like factorization, expansion, simplification or substitution to be performed on the components.

Such a method has been requested in e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42107/basic-work-on-tensor-components/ and was discussed again during [Sage Days 107](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days107).

No, not at all. Thanks for pointing out this. 
In the context of tensor fields, `apply_map` may sound a little bit too vague (for instance, it may evoke a pull back operation associated with a map between manifolds). Would  `apply_map_components` be more appropriate?

I am not a big fan of the terminology but to my mind, consistency is the best option for the Sage interface as a whole.

`apply_map` is redundant. I would just have called it map because of the already existing Python function

```
sage: list(map(lambda x: x^2, range(4)))
[0, 1, 4, 9]
```

I just want to mention that matrices also have a method `map_coefficients` which is very similar, coming from modules with basis. It is supposed to work with an endofunction on the coefficient ring, however it seems to be broken for matrices:

```
sage: matrix.identity(2).map_coefficients(lambda x: x+1)
...
KeyError: 1
```
As `apply_map` does not require an endofunction, it has a more general notion, though.

That's a good point. It should be easy to add a keyword argument such as `keep_other_components=False` or `non-destructive=False` to enforce the consistency between the sets of components in various frames. The components in frames different from the requested one will then be deleted. When requested, they can be recomputed via change-of-frame formulas.
