This ticket adds the method `apply_map` to the class `TensorField`, which applies a function to the coordinate expressions of all components of a tensor field in a given vector frame.
This allows operations like factorization, expansion, simplification or substitution to be performed on the components.

Such a method has been requested in e.g. https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42107/basic-work-on-tensor-components/ and was discussed again during [Sage Days 107](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days107).

No, not at all. Thanks for pointing out this. 
In the context of tensor fields, `apply_map` may sound a little bit too vague (for instance, it may evoke a pull back operation associated with a map between manifolds). Would  `apply_map_components` be more appropriate?

The vagueness also applies to vectors/matrices where map can also refer to a morphism between vector spaces. I am not a big fan of the terminology but to my mind, consistency is the best option for the Sage interface as a whole. This consistency didcatorship includes as an option changing `apply_map` to something better.

`apply_map` is redundant. I would just have called it map because of the already existing Python function

```
sage: list(map(lambda x: x^2, range(4)))
[0, 1, 4, 9]
```

It should be easy to add a keyword argument such as `keep_other_components=False` or `non-destructive=False` to enforce the consistency between the sets of components in various frames. The components in frames different from the requested one will then be deleted. When requested, they can be recomputed via change-of-frame formulas. However, this can be time consuming and, in some cases, may generate a loss of information due to some lack of simplifications.",

Replying to [@PatrickMassot](#comment%3A11):
> I'm the one who asked for this function, so I'm very happy to see this patch. But I'm uneasy about the way it can be used to introduce inconsistencies between frames. Was it already easy to abuse SageManifolds like this before?

> At least I would phrase that as a warning in the docstrings, instead of making it sound like a feature. I mean, it can be a feature where the function being mapped is non-destructive like factor, but substituting a parameter in some frame but not the other is clearly evil.

That's a good point. It should be easy to add a keyword argument such as `keep_other_components=False` or `non-destructive=False` to enforce the consistency between the sets of components in various frames. The components in frames different from the requested one will then be deleted. When requested, they can be recomputed via change-of-frame formulas. However, this can be time consuming and, in some cases, may generate a loss of information due to some lack of simplifications.
