I'd say it might be better to rely on a meaningful test to test for a new enough flint, and not just use the version number.

Something akin to what we do in `build/pkgs/flint/spkg-configure.m4` - where we check for presence of a function that only appeared in Flint 2.5.0.
The difference between 2.5.0 and 2.5.3 is quite small, just some minor bug fixes, so perhaps you can steal the test from `build/pkgs/flint/spkg-configure.m4`, and use it, instead of version grepping?
