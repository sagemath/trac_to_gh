We obtain the polar with both Vrep and Hrep to speed things up.

Along the way we optimize `translation` a bit in the spirit of #28866 and we outsource obtaining the new double description from this method.

Now one can obtain the new data with `_translation_double_description` without actually creating anything.

About the bug that you mentioned, it is really a bug?

I am asking because "polar" means different things depending on which corner of the street you stand at...

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope([[1,0],[0,1],[-1,-1]])
sage: p
2-d reflexive polytope #0 in 2-d lattice M
sage: p.polar()
2-d reflexive polytope #15 in 2-d lattice N
sage: p.polar().vertices()
N( 2, -1),
N(-1,  2),
N(-1, -1)
in 2-d lattice N
```

Thanks for checking this. No it's not a bug. It's exactly the output described in `OUTPUT`.

It's still confusing. But this ticket shouldn't be about making things more uniform.
