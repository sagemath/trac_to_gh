(from #29733)

Let the documentation, in particular
the developer walk-through at

better reflect recent changes to the readme.

Mention that `make` takes very long.

Add discussion of `make build`.

Update Git instructions as discussed in

Also, `build/bin/sage-clone-source` (which is used for creating the git repo in the source tarball) uses `origin` as the name of the remote. I'll change this to `trac` to be consistent with the developer documentation.

  You will then need to `compile Sage

```
I just removed the duplication of (outdated, short) installation instructions from this place. That's an improvement.

Thanks for these welcome changes.

Some lines are indented 3 spaces, maybe use 4 throughout?

Suggested shorter rephrasing:

```
-    * Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (a matching set of these
-      three will avoid the compilation of Sage-specific compilers -
-      unless they are too old).  See the Installation Manual for a
-      discussion of suitable compilers.

```

Here are some changes to the README
(all in a single commit, sorry).

As listed in the commit message:

- Adjust indentation
- Merge steps 2 and 3 for consistency since the Git version
  of step 2 already changed into the Sage directory
- Minor rephrasing, e.g.:
  - "to something not containing any non-alphanumeric characters"
    -> "to contain only alphanumeric characters"
  - "(a matching set of these three will avoid the compilation
    of Sage-specific compilers - unless they are too old)" ->
    "(a recent enough matching set of these three will avoid
    building Sage-specific compilers)."
- Update required disk space to "at least 10 GB" (rather than 6)
- Spell out some abbreviations (OSS license -> software license;
  NFS -> network file system; cd -> change directory)
- Add `--tags` to `git clone`
- Fix minor punctuation inconsistencies (use `-` for all lists
  instead of sometimes `*`, comma after opensuse, period after `bc`)
- Expand the "try it out" item to suggest some things to try
- Suggest bookmarking the local documentation in your browser
- Add link to online list of Sage packages
- Add optional step to add symlink to `sage` in `/usr/local/bin`
