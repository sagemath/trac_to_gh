(from #29733)

Let the documentation, in particular
the developer walk-through at

better reflect recent changes to the readme.

Mention that `make` takes very long.

Add discussion of `make build`.

Update Git instructions as discussed in

Okay, I find a short (but up-to-date) installation instructions helpful for newcomers. It adds quite a barrier if you need to read 5 pages just to get started with compilation.

Other than that, the changes to the docs look good to me. I cannot judge the latest commit, so I leave the ticket on needs review.

Note also that most points of the ticket description are not addressed if I'm not mistaken, so they should probably be moved to new tickets.

Thanks for these welcome changes.

Some lines are indented 3 spaces, maybe use 4 throughout?

Suggested shorter rephrasing:

```
-    * Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (a matching set of these
-      three will avoid the compilation of Sage-specific compilers -
-      unless they are too old).  See the Installation Manual for a
-      discussion of suitable compilers.
+    * Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (a recent enough matching
+      set of these three will avoid building Sage-specific compilers).
+      See the Installation Manual for a discussion of suitable compilers.
```

Positive review from me with or without these changes.

<a id='comment:54'></a>
Here are some changes to the README
(all in a single commit, sorry).

As listed in the commit message:

- Adjust indentation
- Merge steps 2 and 3 for consistency since the Git version
  of step 2 already changed into the Sage directory
- Minor rephrasing, e.g.:
  - "to something not containing any non-alphanumeric characters"
    -> "to contain only alphanumeric characters"
  - "(a matching set of these three will avoid the compilation
    of Sage-specific compilers - unless they are too old)" ->
    "(a recent enough matching set of these three will avoid
    building Sage-specific compilers)."
- Update required disk space to "at least 10 GB" (rather than 6)
- Spell out some abbreviations (OSS license -> software license;
  NFS -> network file system; cd -> change directory)
- Add `--tags` to `git clone`
- Fix minor punctuation inconsistencies (use `-` for all lists
  instead of sometimes `*`, comma after opensuse, period after `bc`)
- Expand the "try it out" item to suggest some things to try
- Suggest bookmarking the local documentation in your browser
- Add link to online list of Sage packages
- Add optional step to add symlink to `sage` in `/usr/local/bin`

Could you please remove this spurious empty line in `README.md`:

```diff
             $ cd sage-x.y/  # adapt x.y
 
-
     - [Git] Alternatively, clone the Sage git repository:
 
             $ ORIG=https://github.com/sagemath/sage.git

```
It causes bad formatting in some markdown readers (e.g. abricotine).
