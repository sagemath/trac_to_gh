(from #29733)

Let the documentation, in particular
the developer walk-through at

better reflect recent changes to the readme.

Mention that `make` takes very long.

Add discussion of `make build`.

Update Git instructions as discussed in

Thanks for these welcome changes.

Some lines are indented 3 spaces, maybe use 4 throughout?

Suggested shorter rephrasing:

```
-    * Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (a matching set of these
-      three will avoid the compilation of Sage-specific compilers -
-      unless they are too old).  See the Installation Manual for a
-      discussion of suitable compilers.
+    * Compilers: `gcc`, `gfortran`, `g++` (a recent enough matching

```

Positive review from me with or without these changes.

<a id='comment:54'></a>
Here are some changes to the README
(all in a single commit, sorry).

As listed in the commit message:

- Adjust indentation
- Merge steps 2 and 3 for consistency since the Git version
  of step 2 already changed into the Sage directory
- Minor rephrasing, e.g.:
  - "to something not containing any non-alphanumeric characters"
    -> "to contain only alphanumeric characters"
  - "(a matching set of these three will avoid the compilation
    of Sage-specific compilers - unless they are too old)" ->
    "(a recent enough matching set of these three will avoid
    building Sage-specific compilers)."
- Update required disk space to "at least 10 GB" (rather than 6)
- Spell out some abbreviations (OSS license -> software license;
  NFS -> network file system; cd -> change directory)
- Add `--tags` to `git clone`
- Fix minor punctuation inconsistencies (use `-` for all lists
  instead of sometimes `*`, comma after opensuse, period after `bc`)
- Expand the "try it out" item to suggest some things to try
- Suggest bookmarking the local documentation in your browser
- Add link to online list of Sage packages
- Add optional step to add symlink to `sage` in `/usr/local/bin`

Could you please remove this spurious empty line in `README.md`:

```diff
             $ cd sage-x.y/  # adapt x.y
 
-
     - [Git] Alternatively, clone the Sage git repository:
 
             $ ORIG=https://github.com/sagemath/sage.git

```
It causes bad formatting in some markdown readers (e.g. abricotine).
