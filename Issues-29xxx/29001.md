#27870 (and one or two other tickets) introduced use of an autoconf macro `PKG_CHECK_VAR` which is included with pkg-config, but only since version 0.28.

Previously there was no problem with using a slightly older pkg-config; in my case:

```
$ pkg-config --version
0.26
```

I think this can be easily worked around by providing a definition of the macro in case it's missing.

Thank you. I also have this problem on CentOS 7.7 with pkg-config 0.27.1, and for some reason the problem persisted even after installing pkg-config 0.29.2. With this branch, bootstrapping works now.

It still looks like a bug to me that `./bootstrap -d` can fail, though. As far as I understand, it should resort to the configure tarball, in this case.
