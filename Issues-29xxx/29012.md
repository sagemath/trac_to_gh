Building the spkg `python3` 3.7.3.p1 fails on Debian with `libc` 2.28-10 when using the `c-compiler` package from conda-forge, as reported in #28745.

The `_crypt` extension module of Python is deprecated in 3.8 and will be removed in 3.10 according to https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0594/

This ticket proposes to remove the module from our build of Python or to ignore errors found during the build.

More information on the failure:
Python3's `configure` script correctly determines that `crypt_r` is available if linking `-lcrypt`.
But this information is not used when building the extension. Instead it links to `crypt` only if `find_library_file` can find libcrypt - which fails.
This flawed logic is still present in CPython master (3.9.0 alpha 2) at https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/setup.py (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/7d6378051feeadf45b4ce45b4b406b65df255648/setup.py#L1035)

```
  def detect_crypt(self):
        # crypt module.
       [...]

        if self.compiler.find_library_file(self.lib_dirs, 'crypt'):
            libs = ['crypt']
        else:
            libs = []

        self.add(Extension('_crypt', ['_cryptmodule.c'],
                               libraries=libs))
}}

#28745 has the Dockerfile that can be used to reproduce it, based on `continuumio/miniconda3:latest` (Debian)

The errors after adding `dpkg-dev` look like this:
