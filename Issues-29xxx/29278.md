As [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50095/error-when-using-non-ascii-characters-as-symbolic-function-name/):

```
sage: μ(x) = x^2
  File "<ipython-input-20-93337e923470>", line 1
    μ(x) = x**Integer(2)
                        ^
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
```

This is a bug in the preparser. Running

```
from sage.repl.preparse import preparse_calculus
preparse_calculus??
```

shows that in order to find the identifier it uses a regex with the range `[a-zA-Z_]`, which is old-fashioned since 9.0.

Note that there is no LaTeX issue here because callable symbolic expressions don't know their own names; the name is only used for the Python identifier.

Depends on #29391

It's not a really a bug. Perhaps it's not properly documented.

Identifier names that make it into SR should be very conservative, because they probably get shipped to all kinds of other interfaces -- by name! As pointed out in the ticket, the name used in the definition of a callable symbolic expression ends up only being used as a python identifier, so perhaps it's fine to relax the relevant regular expression.

Are you working on this? I have been looking into this a little bit and could create a branch.

IMO, this is very much a bug. The preparser should have nothing to do with other interfaces. If a particular interface does not support unicode, it needs to be caught in that interface, not in the preparser.

Note also that the following works just fine:

```
sage: aμ(x) = x^2
```
The problem only exists if the first character is not ASCII.

I have updated all similar regular expressions in the preparser.

This also passes the tests with Python 2.

> Some of the original regular expressions purposely do not include digits, because Python identifiers should not start with digits. This still needs to be taken into account (and perhaps tested).

In place of `[a-zA-Z_]`, I used `[^\W\d]` to account for that, which excludes numbers and non-alphanumeric characters, so effectively only letters and underscores remain (for reference: the [re docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)).
