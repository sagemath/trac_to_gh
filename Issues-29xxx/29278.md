As [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50095/error-when-using-non-ascii-characters-as-symbolic-function-name/):

```
sage: μ(x) = x^2
  File "<ipython-input-20-93337e923470>", line 1
    μ(x) = x**Integer(2)
                        ^
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
```

This is a bug in the preparser. Running

```
from sage.repl.preparse import preparse_calculus
preparse_calculus??
```

shows that in order to find the identifier it uses a regex with the range `[a-zA-Z_]`, which is old-fashioned since 9.0.

Note that there is no LaTeX issue here because callable symbolic expressions don't know their own names; the name is only used for the Python identifier.

<a id='comment:1'></a>It's not a really a bug. Perhaps it's not properly documented.

Identifier names that make it into SR should be very conservative, because they probably get shipped to all kinds of other interfaces -- by name! As pointed out in the ticket, the name used in the definition of a callable symbolic expression ends up only being used as a python identifier, so perhaps it's fine to relax the relevant regular expression.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Are you working on this? I have been looking into this a little bit and could create a branch.

IMO, this is very much a bug. The preparser should have nothing to do with other interfaces. If a particular interface does not support unicode, it needs to be caught in that interface, not in the preparser.

Note also that the following works just fine:

```
sage: aμ(x) = x^2
```
The problem only exists if the first character is not ASCII.

In place of `[a-zA-Z_]`, I used `[^\W\d]` to account for that, which excludes numbers and non-alphanumeric characters, so effectively only letters and underscores remain (for reference: the [re docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)).
