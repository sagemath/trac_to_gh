```
Attempting to plot a single piece of text using the three.js viewer results in an empty scene (besides the coordinate frame):

```
text3d("Hello world!", (1, 2, 3))
```

Inspecting the javascript in the generated HTML file, the `texts` array is empty: `var texts = []`

Adding any other Graphics3d object (even an empty one) to it fixes the problem:

```
from sage.plot.plot3d.base import Graphics3d
text3d("Hello world!", (1, 2, 3)) + Graphics3d()
```

I encountered this in my Ubuntu install based on 9.1.beta3 while working on #29194. I also tried it on my Windows install which is still 8.9, and the bug is present there as well.

I believe it's because [rich_repr_threejs](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx#L401) is expecting the text to always be 2 levels deep after flattening: the `for` loop grabs the 1st level, and the `hasattr(p.all[0], 'string')` is looking at the 2nd level. For a single piece of text, it's only 1 level deep (below a `TransformGroup`). But when added to another `Graphics3d` object it becomes 2 levels deep (that `TransformGroup` is now below a `Graphics3dGroup`).

A similar bug can be produced going in the opposite direction (too many levels):

```
sage: t1 = text3d("t1", (0,0,1))
sage: t2 = text3d("t2", (0,1,0))
sage: t3 = text3d("t3", (1,0,0))
sage: g12 = t1 + t2
sage: g12 = g12.translate(-1,-1,-1)
sage: g123 = g12 + t3
sage: show(g123)
```

In this case, only "t3" gets displayed since its text is 2 levels deep but the text nodes for "t1" and "t2" are now 3 levels deep (`Graphics3dGroup` -> `TransformGroup` -> `TransformGroup` -> `Text`).

I think `_rich_repr_threejs` may need to be modified to walk the tree of groups/transforms to find points/lines/texts instead of relying on flattening.

I ran into a closely related issue earlier today due to the presence of a `TransformGroup`:

```
def revolved(phi):
    return parametric_plot3d([x, 0, sqrt(x)], (x, 0, 1)).rotateZ(phi)
show(revolved(0))
```

...works as expected and just shows a single curve, but...

```
show(revolved(0) + revolved(pi))
```

...produces a single 3D arrow instead of the expected two curves. 

After flattening, each `Line` is under a `TransformGroup`, and both of those are under a single `Graphics3dGroup`. Thus, both lines fall into the case where `hasattr(p, '_trans')` and `hasattr(p.all[0], 'points')` are both `True`, resulting in an arrow.

Hi Paul. Do you mind if I take a shot at fixing this? I wanted to check with you first to make sure there's no duplicated effort. 

I'd like to try out walking the scene graph vs. flattening. I do have an ulterior motive: this would allow me to make my animation branch much more elegant by introducing a `KeyframeAnimationGroup` -- somewhat analogous to a `TransformGroup` -- that can be nested instead of the complicated combination of animation variables, keyframe indices, and the per-object mapping between them that I'm currently using.

This is excellent! I've confirmed it builds and runs as expected. It also fixes #29206 and #29251.

Questions about design choice: Three.js is not the only way to implement WebGL, yet you have named all your new methods `threejs_repr`. I can understand that you would want to move my Three.js-specific modifications out of `json_repr` in `index_face_set`, but should we have separate `json_repr`s for all geometric objects? Or would that just make a mess of things, since we will only be using these new methods in Three.js for the foreseeable future?

Eric, would you like to chime in on this ticket?

I don't have any experience using it, and I didn't want to possibly introduce a bug in one viewer whilst trying to fix one in another :) so I didn't make any modifications directly to those methods or try to introduce corresponding `json_repr` methods for points, lines, and text. I could revisit that decision if desired.\n\nThanks for taking a look at my changes. I know things are kinda hectic recently. I hope all is going well for you and yours.",

I can understand that you would want to move my Three.js-specific modifications out of `json_repr` in `index_face_set`, but should we have separate `json_repr`s for all geometric objects? Or would that just make a mess of things, since we will only be using these new methods in Three.js for the foreseeable future?

For the name, I tried to follow the convention that I saw with some of the other viewers that have their own `*_repr` methods like `jmol_repr` and `tachyon_repr`. I'm not particularly attached to it, though, so I'd be okay with a `webgl_repr` or otherwise if that makes more sense.

I think `json_repr` is what the canvas3d viewer uses, too, [_rich_repr_canvas3d](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx?h=develop#n315). I don't have any experience using it, and I didn't want to possibly introduce a bug in one viewer whilst trying to fix one in another :) so I didn't make any modifications directly to those methods or try to introduce corresponding `json_repr` methods for points, lines, and text. I could revisit that decision if desired.

Thanks for taking a look at my changes. I know things are kinda hectic recently. I hope all is going well for you and yours.

I'll second that! Many thanks, Travis.

I got Sage up and running on a new 32-bit VM, and I was able to verify that your branch builds and that the test case in question now passes on both my 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

I'll keep 32-bit in mind in any future Sage work I do.
