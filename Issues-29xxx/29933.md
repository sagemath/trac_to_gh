<a id='comment:2'></a>Something seems off with the opening double-backtick in this line:

```
You can use ``import_statements`` to get the exact necessary line::
```

Remove extra `x` here

```
 If this fails, you can ask Sage where to find ``PolynomialRing`` using::
-x
+
     sage: PolynomialRing.__module__
```

Please set to positive review on my behalf after that.
