Something seems off with the opening double-backtick in this line:

```
You can use ``import_statements`` to get the exact necessary line::
```

Remove extra `x` here

```
 If this fails, you can ask Sage where to find ``PolynomialRing`` using::
-x
+
     sage: PolynomialRing.__module__
```

Please set to positive review on my behalf after that.

Is it on purpose that some dead link were removed and not replaced by their current location ? I found:

- http://itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/python.html
- http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/
- https://doughellmann.com/blog/2008/03/01/static-code-analizers-for-python/

Maybe some are outdated, in case we should decide explicitely, and perhaps propose an alternative.
