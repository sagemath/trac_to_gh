<a id='comment:5'></a>it's a bloody mess, if you read the numpy issue linked at #29025 - some numpy config functions use `[ALL]` section.

Removing `[DEFAULT]` section allows the build with system OpenBLAS to work again,
so there is clearly something amiss. I messed up while testing #29025 and so it went through.
