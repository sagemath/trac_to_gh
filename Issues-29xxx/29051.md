#29025 broke buidling scipy with system's OpenBLAS. I'm now looking into how to tweak  
`numpy/distutils/site.cfg` to make it work, but it is not obvious. Probably there are more bugs there (in numpy).

it's a bloody mess, if you read the numpy issue linked at #29025 - some numpy config functions use `[ALL]` section.

Removing `[DEFAULT]` section allows the build with system OpenBLAS to work again,
so there is clearly something amiss. I messed up while testing #29025 and so it went through.

Should we just revert  #29025 ?
(at the moment it's not needed anywhere expect in not yet ready tickers)

I don't see an easy fix for it, without digging into numpy mess.

No, [ALL] with just paths in it has no effect, according to numpy people.
So it should be removed.

What was the orginal need for [DEFAULT] in #29025 ?

IMHO all these paths are better set up per library-specific section (`[blas]` etc.)
than via "globals" like `LIBRARY_PATH`.

Attachment: **[vdelecroix-numpy-1.16.1.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket29051/vdelecroix-numpy-1.16.1.log)**

Thanks to Dima (and #29071 and the branch here), I got Sage compile up to numpy. It ends up with some linking trouble. See
- [config.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket29051/vdelecroix-config.log)
- [numpy-1.16.1.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket29051/vdelecroix-numpy-1.16.1.log)

I just downloaded the 9.1.beta2 tarball today, and on an Ubuntu virtual machine it fails on `scipy`, complaining about `blas`:

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-7agkks4g/setup.py", line 492, in <module>
        setup_package()
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-7agkks4g/setup.py", line 488, in setup_package
        setup(**metadata)
      File "/home/john/Sage/sage-9.1.beta2/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/distutils/core.py", line 137, in setup
        config = configuration()
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-7agkks4g/setup.py", line 395, in configuration
        raise NotFoundError(msg)
    numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: No lapack/blas resources found.
```
The main Sage `config.log` file says

```
configure:22549: result:     openblas-0.3.6.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```
Am I doing something wrong?

No you are not. This ticket is supposed to deal with the stuff you just experienced. But this ticket is not included in 9.1.beta2, so it is effectively broken for external openblas.

I just realized that, too. When I merge this, `acipy` builds.
