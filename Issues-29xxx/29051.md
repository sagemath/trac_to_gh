it's a bloody mess, if you read the numpy issue linked at #29025 - some numpy config functions use `[ALL]` section.

Removing `[DEFAULT]` section allows the build with system OpenBLAS to work again,
so there is clearly something amiss. I messed up while testing #29025 and so it went through.

I don't see an easy fix for it, without digging into numpy mess.

No, [ALL] with just paths in it has no effect, according to numpy people.
So it should be removed.

IMHO all these paths are better set up per library-specific section (`[blas]` etc.)
than via "globals" like `LIBRARY_PATH`.

thanks, it's the same Arch-specific issue again - more precisely, numpy does not know about cblas. Testing on Debian wasn't enough.

I just downloaded the 9.1.beta2 tarball today, and on an Ubuntu virtual machine it fails on `scipy`, complaining about `blas`:

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):

```
The main Sage `config.log` file says

```
configure:22549: result:     openblas-0.3.6.p0 will not be installed (configure check)

Am I doing something wrong?
