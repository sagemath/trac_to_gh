#29025 broke buidling scipy with system's OpenBLAS. I'm now looking into how to tweak  
`numpy/distutils/site.cfg` to make it work, but it is not obvious. Probably there are more bugs there (in numpy).

it's a bloody mess, if you read the numpy issue linked at #29025 - some numpy config functions use `[ALL]` section.

Removing `[DEFAULT]` section allows the build with system OpenBLAS to work again,
so there is clearly something amiss. I messed up while testing #29025 and so it went through.

Should we just revert  #29025 ?
(at the moment it's not needed anywhere expect in not yet ready tickers)

I don't see an easy fix for it, without digging into numpy mess.

No, [ALL] with just paths in it has no effect, according to numpy people.
So it should be removed.

What was the orginal need for [DEFAULT] in #29025 ?

IMHO all these paths are better set up per library-specific section (`[blas]` etc.)
than via "globals" like `LIBRARY_PATH`.

I just downloaded the 9.1.beta2 tarball today, and on an Ubuntu virtual machine it fails on `scipy`, complaining about `blas`:

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-7agkks4g/setup.py", line 492, in <module>

        raise NotFoundError(msg)
    numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: No lapack/blas resources found.
```
The main Sage `config.log` file says

```
configure:22549: result:     openblas-0.3.6.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```
Am I doing something wrong?
