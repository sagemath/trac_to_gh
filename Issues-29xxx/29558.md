Regarding a homebrew section: I am having problems with figuring out how to autogenerate the files `homebrew.txt` and `homebrew-optional.txt`. If I just add `homebrew` to the list of `SYSTEM`s in `src/doc/bootstrap`, I end up with this for `homebrew.txt`:

```
    $ brew install boost freetype gcc gd git gmp gpatch gsl libmpc libpng mpfi mpfr openblas pcre pkg-config ppl python3 r readline sqlite xz yasm zeromq zlib
# Afterwards: 
# To automatically take care of homebrew messages regarding 
# keg-only packages for the current shell session:
# $ source /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/.homebrew-build-env
# Add this to your shell profile if you want it to persist between shell sessions.
```
I really just want the first line, and then I can add the rest by hand. Along the same lines, the files for `cygwin` are a little broken. `cygwin.txt` looks like

```
    $ # first install apt-cyg from https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg
apt-cyg install R binutils bzip2 cddlib-devel cddlib-tools curl findutils gcc-core gcc-core gcc-fortran gcc-fortran gcc-g++ gcc-g++ git glpk libatomic_ops-devel libboost-devel libbz2-devel libcrypt-devel libcurl-devel libffi-devel libflint-devel libfreetype-devel libgd-devel libglpk-devel libgmp-devel libgsl-devel libiconv-devel liblapack-devel liblzma-devel libmpc-devel libmpfr-devel libncurses-devel libntl-devel libopenblas libpcre-devel libreadline-devel libsqlite3-devel libtirpc-devel libzmq-devel m4 make patch perl perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker python37 python37-devel python37-urllib tar which xz yasm zlib-devel
```
and the resulting output in the installation guide doesn't look perfect.

Is the URL `https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg` stable enough that it should just be included in the text? Then we would really want this to just say `$ apt-cyg install R ...`.
