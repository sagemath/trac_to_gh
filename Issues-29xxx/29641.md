Two comments; everything else LGTM.

Is this faster?

```diff
+    return all(x == y for x, y in zip(list_, prefix))
 
-    return list[:len(prefix)] == prefix
```
(I agree with the first simple check.) I think most the lists are very small, so doing the slice shouldn't be a problem memory-wise. I would think using the direct list equality check would be faster than doing the Python iteration check.

Raising a `TypeError` in an `__eq__` seems like a bad practice to me. I think that should instead just return `False`.
