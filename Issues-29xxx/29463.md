The fix in #29408 works at least with the OS X Python installation. When I say "works," I mean that all tests pass. I did, however, twice see a dialog box saying "Python quit unexpectedly."

I will also try with Homebrew's Python.

Yes, I have seen this too on my machine.  My guess is that we have some tests that crash some python process deliberately
