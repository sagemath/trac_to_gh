<a id='comment:4'></a>This ticket is invalid. It is clear from the original version of comment:1 that it is based on an misunderstanding of graph-theoretic terminology: 

* A "loop" is an edge `[v,v]` from a vertex to itself.
* A sequence of edges that returns to the starting point is a "cycle", not a loop.
