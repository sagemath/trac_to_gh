```
The `sage` script has a number of options that only make sense for sage-the-distribution, but do not make sense in downstream packaging of sage. Consequently, downstream packagers may install simple custom versions of the script that only provide a subset of the options.

Examples:
- `sage -sqlite` -- as discussed in #29002/#29092 -- because from a downstream packaging point of view, sage is not really responsible for providing sqlite, it's provided by justs another system package
- `sage -upgrade` -- only makes sense with sage-the-distribution built from source

We should specify the subset of sage command line options that must be supported in any deployment/packaging of sage. This is so that user packages can work reliably.

Examples:
- `sage -c SAGECOMMAND` -- obviously
- `sage -python -c COMMAND`
- `sage -t` -- because it is used by user packages for testing sage sources
- `sage -sh` ..... ?

In this ticket, we actually split `src/bin/sage` into sagelib functionality and sage-the-distribution functionality. `src/bin/sage` delegates unknown options to `build/bin/sage-site`. 

Ideally, distributions should be able to use an unmodified `src/bin/sage`.

Hum, this ticket reminds me that I need to clean the version in sage-on-gentoo

```
fbissey@moonloop ~ $ sage -advanced
SageMath version 9.2.beta1, Release Date: 2020-06-13

Running Sage:

                         See the output of sage --notebook --help
                         for more details and examples of how to pass
                         optional arguments
  -inotebook [...]    -- start the *insecure* Sage notebook (deprecated)
  -n, -notebook [...] -- start the default Sage notebook (options are the
                         same as for the notebook command in Sage).  See the
                         output of sage -n -h for more details

                         start up; optionally specify a module to get more
                         details about that particular module
  -t [options] <--all|files|dir>
                      -- test examples in .py, .pyx, .sage, .tex or .rst files
                         selected options:
                           --long - include lines with the phrase 'long time'

                           --warn-long [timeout] - warning if doctest is slow
                           --only-errors - only output failures, not successes
                           --gc=GC - control garbarge collection (ALWAYS:
                                     collect garbage before every test; NEVER:
                                     disable gc; DEFAULT: Python default)
                           --help - show all testing options
  -tp <N> [...]       -- like -t above, but tests in parallel using N threads
                         with 0 interpreted as a sensible default
  -testall [options]  -- test all source files, docs, and examples.  options
                         like -t

File conversion:
  -rst2ipynb [...]    -- Generates Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) from standalone
                         reStructuredText source.
                         (not installed currently, run sage -i rst2ipynb)
  -ipynb2rst [...]    -- Generates a reStructuredText source file from
                         a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb).

Valgrind memory debugging:
  -cachegrind         -- run Sage using Valgrind's cachegrind tool.  The log
                         files are named sage-cachegrind.PID can be found in
                         
  -callgrind          -- run Sage using Valgrind's callgrind tool.  The log
                         files are named sage-callgrind.PID can be found in
                         
  -massif             -- run Sage using Valgrind's massif tool.  The log
                         files are named sage-massif.PID can be found in
                         
  -memcheck           -- run Sage using Valgrind's memcheck tool.  The log
                         files are named sage-memcheck.PID can be found in
                         
  -omega              -- run Sage using Valgrind's omega tool.  The log
                         files are named sage-omega.PID can be found in
                         
  -valgrind           -- this is an alias for -memcheck

You can also use -- before a long option, e.g., 'sage --optional'.
```
I have to drop the py2/py3 stuff for just defaut python. I dropped `-sh` the day I dropped `sage-env` altogether, the main point of keeping `sage -sh` around was to check or use the environment set by `sage-env`.

`sage -python` means: run the python that sage runs in.
In distributions, this could just be plain Python.

Install scripts of user packages need this.

I don't remember all the options for `-notebook`, but I think it would be helpful to have some sort of warning message (or page?) that `sagenb` would raise, rather than removing it completely.  For instance, it could just open the export-to-Jupyter page by default, with an extra little warning template that "if you want to use the old sagenb, please use Sage prior to 9.x".  Probably what anyone who tries to use sagenb would want is the export at this point, and this is one way to inform them.

John, what does your branch give for `sage -n -h` or `sage --notebook --help` which is somewhat prominently mentioned in the `sage -advanced` help?  Is any of what comes out of that still valid?

this has been the standard behavior for a while. At #29885, I am proposing changing this to make running the Jupyter notebook the default behavior. We should probably continue the notebook discussion at #29885.

I tend to like the extra details `options.rst` more than what is printed by `sage --advanced`. Would it be too verbose if we used (more or less) the current `options.rst` for the output to `sage --advanced`?

I would also organize it differently, distinguishing the options that are not available in distros.

I agree with these changes.

Some comments on `sage --advanced`:

1) I think `--grep ...--search_doc` should go to `src/bin/sage`, conditionalized on `$SAGE_SRC`

2) I think `--gdb*, `--python*`, --ipython*`, `--pip`, and perhaps `--jupyter*`  should go to `src/bin/sage`

I certainly can run under `gdb` for example, in fact it is bizarre that `gdb` is treated differently from `valgrind` et al. (1) in the way suggested is acceptable.

Also, I think you have an alignment problem in `src/bin/sage` right now.

Never shipped them before, they don't look harmful but it is more development focused than a test suite is. A test suite is run by anyone who wants to check that their install has a certain level of "sanity". coverage is really a tool for devs that look for something to do.

Right, that was my thought, too. And then it didn't make sense to separate `coverage` and `coverageall`.

I have a few more questions:

- I would like to delete the `-rsyncdist` option. Can we also delete `sage-rsyncdist`? The file itself says "NOTE: This script is of little use after the git transition and will be deleted eventually."

- Is it worth moving handling of `-gap` et al. to `sage-site`, which is where they are documented?

- A comment: it would be nice to move `sage --sdist` handling to `sage-site`, but then we have to duplicate `maybe_sage_location`, so it's probably not worth it. Although then we could move `sage -b` handling, too. This can be done later, if someone feels motivated.

The intention of using `SAGE_SRC` from `sage-env` here is that packagers would leave it undefined if they do not package a distribution.

How about moving the handling of `-h`, `-advanced` below the sourcing of `sage-env`?

OK, so I am having this look over, mainly at `sage` and what is now called `sage-site`. And I have to say splitting the stuff is not easy and subject to controversy so what I say is not going to be the final word on the matter.

This branch version of `sage` still execute numerous options that are not listed in the sage menu but that would be displayed by `sage-site`.
* `--upgrade`
* `--buildsh`
* `-i`
* `-f`
* the function `build_sage` (I would have thought it belonged to `sage-site`)
* same with `maybe_sage_location`
* all `-b` options
I recognise that some of these may have to live there for technical reason. Splitting `--sh` and `--buildsh` for example would lead to code duplication - unless someone also does some refactoring. But as it is now, they could be accidentally called from a sage-on-distro shipping this file. If they have to stay there, we should get a check on `SAGE_ROOT` before executing them and display some error message if it is not defined. Like "not available in this distribution of sagemath".

Conversely I thought calling on sage's version of various packages (`gap`, `singular`, `maxima`, etc...) was to stay in the main `sage` script rather than move to `sage-site`. They usually execute normally with system installed packages and may be required for running some user scripts.

Right, this ticket is certainly not meant as the final word on splitting the script. 
But by splitting the help strings on this ticket, we define the interface, and this is to me the most important part.  The patch is already huge, and it is best to do further refactoring and refinements in narrower follow-up tickets.

This sounds like a good idea, but I would also prefer to do this on a follow-up ticket.

> Conversely I thought calling on sage's version of various packages (`gap`, `singular`, `maxima`, etc...) was to stay in the main `sage` script rather than move to `sage-site`. They usually execute normally with system installed packages and may be required for running some user scripts.

It would be fine with me to move them back to `sage`.

I am OK with that. Let's get the interface where we want it then.

This is acceptable. 9.2 is not getting anywhere very fast :) To put things in perspective I was thinking of having a function rather than writing a very similar piece of code all over the place.

Right, since we want to set the interface right we have to decide if this is something that is important for the distribution to support. On one side, it just works like it is, on the other side it is redundant with calling the application directly. The only interesting point is whether there are scripts out there that needs this for compatibility. 

These direct calls to various applications could also be replaced by `sage --sh $app`, `sage --sh` was actually developed some time after those direct calls were put in place (IIRC). So a migration path could be suggested and they could be deprecated. That would be yet another follow up ticket.
