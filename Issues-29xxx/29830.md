(from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/OXOmOjlYQLo/7gOLtzsJCQAJ)

We already reject gcc 10, but if gfortran is installed separately, we also have to check that version.

We also check for `gfortran-9` first, and on `homebrew`, we recommend installing it via `brew install gcc`@`9`.

just make sure it is possible to override with 

```
./configure --with-gfortran=
```
hmm, should it be with

```
./configure FC=
```

I am confused here
