I have a problem with sage on python3, example sage8.9 and 9.0

simple code:

```
import mpmath
mpmath.mp.prec = 1000
mpmath.findroot(lambda x: x^2 - 3, 2)

OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pyx", line 1691, in sage.libs.mpmath.ext_main.mpf_base.__repr__ (build/cythonized/sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.c:21256)
    return "mpf('%s')" % to_str(self._mpf_, n)
  File "/home/nouret/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpmath/libmp/libmpf.py", line 1242, in to_str
    sign, digits, exponent = to_digits_exp(s, dps+3)
  File "/home/nouret/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpmath/libmp/libmpf.py", line 1200, in to_digits_exp
    digits = numeral(sd, base=10, size=dps)
  File "/home/nouret/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpmath/libmp/libintmath.py", line 158, in numeral_python
    A, B = divmod(n, base**half)
SystemError: <built-in function divmod> returned a result with an error set
```




Problem is on File ".../SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpmath/libmp/libintmath.py", line 161, in numeral_python

and using

```
A, B = n // (base**half), n % (base**half)
```
instead of

```
A, B = divmod(n, base**half)
```
solves this problem

The bug reported here is located in the Sage integer class, more precisely in the method `quo_rem` which is invoked from the code in `numeral_python`. Note that it disappears if you deactivate the mpmath sage backend, that means to call `os.environ['MPMATH_NOSAGE'] ='Y'` before you import `mpmath`.

The bug can be reproduced independently of mpmath in sage by the following example:

```python
sage: divmod(1, sys.maxsize+1r)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-292a3012ef4a> in <module>
----> 1 divmod(Integer(1), sys.maxsize+1)

SystemError: <built-in function divmod> returned a result with an error set
```

The error occurs if the first argument is a sage integer and the second a python `int` of size larger than `sys.maxsize` in the statement `d = PyInt_AS_LONG(other)`. Therefore, I'm suggesting the following fix:

```diff

         cdef Integer q = PY_NEW(Integer)
         cdef Integer r = PY_NEW(Integer)
         cdef long d, res

-        if type(other) is int:
+        if is_small_python_int(other):
             d = PyInt_AS_LONG(other)
             if d > 0:
                 mpz_fdiv_qr_ui(q.value, r.value, self.value, d)

```

I suspect that there are some other places of code using `PyInt_AS_LONG` where a similar fix will be necessary to have them work with python3 for large python `int`. Shall I open a ticket for that?

I added this for ease of reading as it gets much closer to the problem. If you want to save tests, I can remove it (or better the other one?).

please add a comment describing `divmod()` meaning (imagine someone who didn't read details of this ticket seeing it - it looks like a typo).

something like `# sanity check - see #29009 for details` will do, if you cannot think of a better one.
