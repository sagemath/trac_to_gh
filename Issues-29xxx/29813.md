Of course the problem with this approach is that it depends on SSL...
for example on `ubuntu-focal-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/748390636):

```
  [pytest]   Could not fetch URL https://pypi.org/simple/pytest/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pypi.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /simple/pytest/ (Caused by SSLError("Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.")) - skipping
  [pytest]   ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pytest (from -r /sage/build/pkgs/pytest/requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: none)
  [pytest]   ERROR: No matching distribution found for pytest (from -r /sage/build/pkgs/pytest/requirements.txt (line 1))
  [pytest]   WARNING: pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.

Does this mean that SSL needs to be installed on the hosts to use pytest?
Why is this a problem?
