Following a discussion in #19680, #28998, because `pytest` is only needed if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, standard packages are allowed to depend on this optional package -- if they make the dependency conditional on `SAGE_CHECK` (see #29766 for an example).



Depends on #29345

Of course the problem with this approach is that it depends on SSL...
for example on `ubuntu-focal-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/748390636):

```
  [pytest]   Could not fetch URL https://pypi.org/simple/pytest/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pypi.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /simple/pytest/ (Caused by SSLError("Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.")) - skipping

Does this mean that SSL needs to be installed on the hosts to use pytest?
Why is this a problem?
