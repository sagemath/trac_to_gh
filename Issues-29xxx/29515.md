With the attached file put under build/pkgs/singular configure works:

---

Checking whether [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) should install SPKG singular...

checking whether any of gmp mpfr is installed or will be installed as SPKG... no

checking for libSingular... yes

configure: will use system package and not install SPKG singular

---

...

singular-4.1.1p2.p0:                         using system package; SPKG will not be installed


But I have remarked that sage builts only when singular has been built with '--with-ntl': some more checks could be added.
