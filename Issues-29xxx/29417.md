```
This makes the following changes to tox.ini:
- `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard` now uses python3 from homebrew.

   This attempts to reproduce the environment of https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/kU5M1QVuQQY/Zu10Q-CKAwAJ

- `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3_xcode` uses `/usr/bin/python3` (was the old default)

- `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-python3_pythonorg` uses the Python 3.7 installation from the binary package from python.org

New toolchain factors: `gcc_spkg`, `gcc_9`.

Improved docker interface.

This appears to be the reason that every single test is marked as failed, which is kind of annoying.

Help with this would be most welcome!

I have the following browser tabs open, which should help with finding a solution. Essentially, one needs to reconfigure the docker daemon to use  larger `dm.basesize`.

Yes, this is expected behavior.

But it would perhaps be better to change it so that the docker build succeeds if there are only testsuite failures

Failing `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` (default = `ptest`) do not abort the build. These show as green checkmarks in the left pane, but for all failing doctest logs (both packages and sagelib ptest) also a yellow "Check warning" is displayed as annotation in the right pane.

By setting `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` to include names of optional packages, we can also test these in the same way.

<a id='comment:68'></a>I presume that various errors on local-macos `standard` runs are to be debugged individually. 

e.g. on https://github.com/dimpase/sage/runs/591413919 (homebrew-macos-python3_xcode, minimal) I see `##[error] ==== ERROR IN LOG FILE artifacts/logs-commit-8bb28ec8ffd6869c6b86e3f5224333decb049d09-tox-local-homebrew-macos-python3_xcode-minimal/log/pkgs/gc-7.6.4.p0.log ====` and
`Warning: Error testing package gc-7.6.4.p0 (ignored)`

Yes, download the log artifact.  But it only says 

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
