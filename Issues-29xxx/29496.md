These need to be updated to reflect the installation changes in 9.1.

As the same time, we do some overdue updates (e.g., remove mention of Solaris) and remove some duplication to simplify maintenance. 

Related issues:
- Website updates:
   [x] https://github.com/sagemath/website/pull/187 - Get rid of links to download-packages.html
- Should remove outdated, duplicated, misleading material at wiki.sagemath.org or mark as outdated:
   [x] https://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms (marked as outdated)
