We add two methods `L_polynomial()` and `number_of_rational_points()` to integral curves. These methods have already been with global function fields, but the methods with curves also work for singular curves. 

Examples from the branch:

```
            sage; A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
            sage: C = Curve(y^2 - x^5 - x^4 - 2*x^3 - 2*x - 2)
            sage: Cbar = C.projective_closure()
            sage: Cbar.L_polynomial()
            9*t^4 - 3*t^3 + t^2 - t + 1  
```
and

```
            sage; A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
            sage: C = Curve(y^2 - x^5 - x^4 - 2*x^3 - 2*x - 2)
            sage: Cbar = C.projective_closure()
            sage: Cbar.number_of_rational_points(3)
            21
            sage: D = Cbar.change_ring(Cbar.base_ring().extension(3))
            sage: D.base_ring()
            Finite Field in z3 of size 3^3
            sage: len(D.closed_points())
            21 
```

I had noticed the typos, but forgot to upload the commit. 

Done. Passed all the tests.

Thanks.
