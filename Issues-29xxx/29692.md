The following code:

```
B = BraidGroup(5)
Link(B([3, 4, 3, -4])).plot()
```

shows an incorrect link. (Should be a disjoint union of unknots.)

There was a bug in the code that deletes the unused strands. I replaced the complicated part with a line that lets python do the work (and is therefore less likely to be buggy).

```
sage: # before the PR (incorrect)
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: L = Link(B([3,4,3,-4]))
sage: L
Link with 4 components represented by 4 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s2*s0*s2^-1
```

```
sage: # after the PR (correct)
sage: B = BraidGroup(5)
sage: L = Link(B([3,4,3,-4]))
sage: L
Link with 1 component represented by 4 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s1*s0*s1^-1
```
