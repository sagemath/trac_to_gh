We have some basic statistics functionality in [sage stats](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/stats/index.html) for some descriptive statistics.  Unfortunately, it is *really* basic.

This ticket is for clarifying the relationship of that material to the Sage [probability distributions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/probability/index.html), `histogram`, Scipy, GSL, and other libraries - perhaps including pandas, though this is not (yet) standard in Sage.  

* Ideally there would be interfaces to the best native Python functionality rather than something specific to Sage (though that may not be possible).
* There may be a tutorial page in the (reference manual) documentation for demonstrating best practices.
* There could be a more education-oriented tutorial elsewhere, along the lines of [the PREP Quickstart](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Quickstarts/Statistics-and-Distributions.html) but more comprehensive.
* As noted at #29662, Python 3 has a [stats module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html), though presumably that module can't handle (say) the mean of several `Integer`s or even stranger objects, as-is.

If all of those generate interest, this ticket would be converted to a metaticket to keep track of them.

Depends on #29662

I use pandas pretty heavily from within Sage (Python 2.7 version).  The only problem I encounter has to do with pandas not recognizing Sage's Integer as an integer.   Assuming one has the standard preparser on, you have to do things like:

```
dataframe.loc[int(100)]
dataframe.apply(some_function, axis=int(1))
```
to keep it happy.

Yes, I just use `pip install` which has always worked smoothly (though it takes a bit of time to compile).  The main dependency is just a reasonably recent version of `numpy` which of course Sage has.

I added

```
from sage.rings.integer import Integer
if type(key) is Integer:
    ...
```
to pandas/core/indexes/{base,range}.py
