From sage-devel thread

```
B = [[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10],
 [1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10],
 [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10],
 [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10],
 [2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11],
 [2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]]
C = B + [[1..11]]
I1 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],B)
I2 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],C)
A1 = I1.automorphism_group()
A2 = I2.automorphism_group()
A1.order()==A2.order()
```
returs false - the group orders are 96 and 32, rather than equal to 96.
This still is correct (same group) in Sage 8.9 with Python 2, but wrong in 9.1.rc0 as well as in 9.0 (with Python 3).

Can it not be possible that the case is like a particular nuance? because as reported by the user in Sage-Devel, the results were accurate for the other test cases?

I think this bug is located in `search_tree` (`sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs`) since with optional package `bliss` installed it is not reproducible.

Samuel, does #30637 fail with `bliss`, as well?
