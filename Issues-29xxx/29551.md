From sage-devel thread

```
B = [[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10],
 [1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10],
 [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10],
 [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11],
 [1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10],
 [2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11],
 [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10],
 [2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11],
 [2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]]
C = B + [[1..11]]
I1 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],B)
I2 = IncidenceStructure([1..11],C)
A1 = I1.automorphism_group()
A2 = I2.automorphism_group()
A1.order()==A2.order()
```
returs false - the group orders are 96 and 32, rather than equal to 96.
This still is correct (same group) in Sage 8.9 with Python 2, but wrong in 9.1.rc0 as well as in 9.0 (with Python 3).
