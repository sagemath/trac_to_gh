This ticket changes `SAGE_ROOT`, so that it is always the absolute physical path, i.e. symbolic links are resolved.

---

As reported on [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/kU5M1QVuQQY/4ClWRtgMBAAJ), when building Sage 9.1.beta9 from a path that is a symbolic link, the following test in `src/sage/env.py` fails:

```
    sage: env = {k:v for (k,v) in os.environ.items() if not k.startswith("SAGE_")}
    sage: from subprocess import check_output
    sage: cmd = "from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL; print((SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL))"
    sage: out = check_output([sys.executable, "-c", cmd], env=env).decode().strip()   # long time
    sage: out == repr((SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL))                                        # long time
```

The problem is that the left path in `out` is the symbolic link to Sage's root directory, whereas `SAGE_ROOT` is the absolute path without symbolic link.

Another way to see this problem directly:

```
./sage -sh
(sage-sh)$ unset SAGE_ROOT
(sage-sh)$ python3
>>> from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT
>>> SAGE_ROOT     # outputs the symbolic link, not the physical path
```

Rather than changing the doctest to use abspath, it seems that in both cases `SAGE_ROOT` should already be a path without symbolic links in it.

I am not sure where `SAGE_ROOT` is initialized for the Python executable. I tried to replace `pwd` by `pwd -P` in `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`, but it did not help, unless the value is cached somewhere.

I assume this is a step towards making sagelib more usable from Python. Previously, SAGE_ROOT was just `None`.

Yes, that works as usual.

It seems that `resolvelinks` is not related to this, as it messes with relative links, not absolute ones.

I think the problem is that `src/bin/sage-env-config` sets `SAGE_ROOT` to the symbolic link after running configure from the symbolic location. Rerunning configure from the physical location sets `SAGE_ROOT` back to the physical path.

Should this problem be handled in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in` or in `src/bin/sage-env`?

```

> I think the problem is that `src/bin/sage-env-config` sets `SAGE_ROOT` to the symbolic link after running configure from the symbolic location. Rerunning configure from the physical location sets `SAGE_ROOT` back to the physical path.


Are you saying that the only setting in which you observe the reported warnings is when you manually call `configure` with different `SAGE_ROOT`s? 

Then I'm not sure if anything needs to be fixed.

In `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env`:

```
# Make NEW_SAGE_ROOT absolute
NEW_SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$NEW_SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
```

In `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`:

```
# Make SAGE_ROOT absolute
SAGE_ROOT=`cd "$SAGE_ROOT" && pwd -P`
```

Of course, these comments are not precise. The `-P` option makes these directories not just "absolute" but actually "physical" (all symlinks resolved).

In contrast, in `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config.in`:

```
export SAGE_ROOT="@abs_top_srcdir@"
```
autoconf's `@abs_top_srcdir@` is only absolute, but not physical.

I see two possible fixes:

a) Get rid of all the above `-P`. It's up the user to express the `SAGE_ROOT` using whatever symlinks they like to use.  Use `pwd -P` only for the following: Issue the warning regarding changing `SAGE_ROOT` in `sage-env` only if they do not resolve to the same physical path.

b) `AC_SUBST(SAGE_ROOT)` and change `export SAGE_ROOT="@abs_top_srcdir@"` to `...@SAGE_ROOT@`.

`./configure` determines `SAGE_ROOT` automatically, without explicitly setting it, but the result depends on whether the current directory is symbolic or not.

I prefer option b), since with a) it is confusing if the behavior depends on the (symbolic) path that was used to cd into SAGE_ROOT. If, for example, I open a new tab from SAGE_ROOT, the current directory is always the physical path, so it is easy to confuse the two.

Option b) seems to work for me, but to test this on the affected machine I first need to install dependencies for bootstrap.

Ok, this works for me now. With this branch, SAGE_ROOT will always be the absolute physical path, like it used to be until recently. In particular, the doctest from the description works now.

SAGE_LOCAL was already the physical path, so nothing needs to be changed for that.
