We add the lists of system packages providing polymake's Perl prerequisites 
so that `./configure` will include them in the list of suggested packages.

At least for the distributions that provide these packages, this is more reliable than depending on users reading `build/pkgs/polymake/SPKG.txt`.

This is achieved by adding them in `distros/` of a new script package `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` (a new dependency of `polymake`) with an `spkg-configure.m4` that checks for the prerequisites and an `spkg-install` that always fails. 

(See also the more ambitious #27763, which will not be ready for 9.1.)

Is this ready for review? Some comments, in any case: when I use this on OS X, `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` fails to build, and its log file says:

```
.../sage-9.1.beta7/build/bin/sage-logger: line 91: .../sage-9.1.beta7/build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/spkg-install: Permission denied
```
A key point is that it doesn't have a line matching the regular expression `^Error`, so I see this:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make polymake'):

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the
environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.
```
I assume you're going to make `spkg-install` fail with a meaningful error message?

Thanks for the feedback. This ticket is not ready for review.

What it is missing (the same applies to the "libnauty" business on #27952) is a way for optional packages to signal configure-time errors ONLY if they are configured to be installed. 

This is trickier than it sounds because optional packages may be dependencies of other optional packages.
(See also #29363	At the end of configure, indicate which optional/experimental packages are configured to be installed)
