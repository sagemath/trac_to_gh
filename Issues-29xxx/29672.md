If all of the major distros are using the same convoluted build process to achieve a consistent naming scheme, then to me that still suggests that we should upstream that build process. It's hard for me to justify building the same package four times and installing a bunch of executables with non-standard names just to make the test suite of another package that's not even in the tree pass.

In lieu of some agreement, I'll probably add a fallback to sagelib so that it uses `class.x` instead of `class-4d.x` when the latter isn't present (like we did with nauty). That will allow sage to keep working with the "out of the box" version of palp.

Harald Skarke just merged these patches. It probably wouldn't be hard to fix the naming issue if everyone can agree on a solution.

I think having one executable (e.g. `class.x`) dispatch to the proper routine is clearly preferable, *if* the dimension can be determined quickly enough to do so. This avoids invalidating the examples in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204356) unnecessarily, and doesn't pollute `/usr/bin` with four copies of the same programs.
