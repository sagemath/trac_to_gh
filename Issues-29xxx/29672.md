it should be easy - it's a stable package, with just binary executables and data.

In debian it is called `palp`

The reason I haven't included this in Gentoo yet is because sage builds optimized versions of the `class.x`, `cws.x`, `nef.x`, and `poly.x` executables -- and then installs them with nonstandard names.

I think I forgot to write this: in `sage/geometry/polyhedron/palp_database.py`, we have

```
        return Popen(['class-4d.x', '-He',
```

so Sage does use at least use *that* nonstandard name, and this script needs to check for it. I'm not sure if that will affect any of the other distros.

If all of the major distros are using the same convoluted build process to achieve a consistent naming scheme, then to me that still suggests that we should upstream that build process. It's hard for me to justify building the same package four times and installing a bunch of executables with non-standard names just to make the test suite of another package that's not even in the tree pass.

In lieu of some agreement, I'll probably add a fallback to sagelib so that it uses `class.x` instead of `class-4d.x` when the latter isn't present (like we did with nauty). That will allow sage to keep working with the "out of the box" version of palp.

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment%3A10):
> In light of that, you should check all 16 combinations of executable names `(poly, class, nef cws) x (4,5,6 11)` in the spkg-configure.m4. I started a branch at u/mjo/ticket/29672 that checks for `class-4d.x` and substitutes `class.x` in its place, but I'm not going to spend three days doing it for the other 15 names.

OK, I'll try my hand in nested m4 loops :-)

Harald Skarke just merged these patches. It probably wouldn't be hard to fix the naming issue if everyone can agree on a solution.

I think having one executable (e.g. `class.x`) dispatch to the proper routine is clearly preferable, *if* the dimension can be determined quickly enough to do so. This avoids invalidating the examples in the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204356) unnecessarily, and doesn't pollute `/usr/bin` with four copies of the same programs.
