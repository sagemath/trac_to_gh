Sage offers two interfaces to the [GMP-ECM](http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/) library. One text based in Python `sage.interfaces.ecm` and one in Cython `sage.libs.libecm` that uses C function calls.

This ticket stands for replacing the text based interface by the Cython one. Currently, the Python interface has much more options than the Cython version.


Also the code and documentation of `Integer.factor` should be adapted.
