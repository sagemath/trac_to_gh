In Sage 9.0, we have:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: t = E.tensor_field(1, 1, [[x, 1], [0, y]])
sage: t['^μ_μ']
...
ValueError: index conventions not satisfied
```
Now, after the Python 3 switch, any unicode *non-digit word-constituent* character should be accepted, see [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/NUWoWB7i8tw/ZMKZ7N0uCAAJ). This is especially pertinent for tensor indices, since Greek letters are often used to denote them.
