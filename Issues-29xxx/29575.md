This looks like this should be handled in #27122.

`_mm512_castps512_ps256` is an AVX512F instruction (see 
[https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm512_castps512_ps256&expand=625](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=_mm512_castps512_ps256&expand=625)) and it looks like gcc 4.9.2 just cannot handle it.

And I think this only happened on the test branch because #27122 was tested and therefore `-march=native` in `CFLAGS`.
