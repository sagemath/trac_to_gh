Coercing a fractional ideal of a number field to an S-class group over the same number field sometimes raises a KeyError and an AssertionError.

Here is a failing example:

```
R.<x> = QQ[]
L.<t> = NumberField(x^2 - 6058)
S = L.primes_above(2)
C = L.S_class_group(S)
J = L.fractional_ideal(1)
print("C(J):", C(J))	# Should print the trivial S-ideal class of C, but raises errors.
```

This was tested in Sage 9.0, 8.8, and 8.6, always yielding the same error.

**Keywords:** S_class_group, fractional_ideal

The bug is in the `NumberField._S_class_group_quotient_matrix()` method. 

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
....: L.<t> = NumberField(x^2 - 6058) 
....: S = L.primes_above(2) 
....: L._S_class_group_quotient_matrix(tuple(S))                                
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
   ...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
/Applications/math/sage-9.2/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py in _S_class_group_quotient_matrix(self, S)
   4644         M = matrix(ZZ, M)
   4645         A, Q = M.hermite_form(transformation=True)
-> 4646         assert A[:c] == 1 and A[c:] == 0
   4647         return Q[:c, :a]
   4648 

AssertionError:
```
The rows of the matrix M are generators of <S> and generators of the quotient I/<S>, where I is the ideal class group, so the rows generate I. The algorithm assumed that lifting these generators to Z<sup>n</sup> would provide a set of generators of Z<sup>n</sup>, but that is not usually true. 

The PR adds additional rows to M that are generators of the kernel of the homomorphism from Z<sup>n</sup> to I. (Each generator of the kernel has only one nonzero entry, which is the order of the corresponding generator of I.)  This squashes the bug:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[] 
....: L.<t> = NumberField(x^2 - 6058) 
....: S = L.primes_above(2) 
....: C = L.S_class_group(S) 
....: J = L.fractional_ideal(1) 
....: print("C(J):", C(J))                                                               
C(J): Trivial S-ideal class
```
(The fix is only one line of code, but the PR also adds a doctest, and deletes some space-only lines elsewhere in the file.)
