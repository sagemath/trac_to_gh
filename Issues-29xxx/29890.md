This is a workaround for a minor annoyance affecting sage developers who update packages on macOS.

python2 urllib works correctly with ssl but the python3 may not (as discussed in #29418). The correct fix is to update `sage_bootstrap` to initialize certificates, or to use a higher-level library for downloading. The workaround to use python2 gives us a bit of time... until Apple removes python2 from the OS.

Probably we should add automatic testing for all optional packages. `.github/workflows/tox-optional.yml` only tests the following: 

  `4ti2 pynormaliz qepcad lrslib latte_int topcom barvinok isl qhull sage_numerical_backends_coin primecount plantri polymake jupymake kenzo libsemigroups mcqd meataxe mpfrcx openssl p_group_cohomology rst2ipynb sirocco tdlib tides` 

(and their dependencies).
