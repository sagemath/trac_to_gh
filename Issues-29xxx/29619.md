As observed on this [Ask SageMath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/51004), it does not seem to be possible to iterate over the non-zero entries of a tensor. This is unfortunate because the entries are stored in a sparse format, in a dictionary.

Since a tensor might have symmetries, this is more involved than just iterating over the dictionary, but such an iterator would immediately be useful for the implementation of the `display()` method, for instance.

Here we implement a method `Components.items`, returning an iterable of `(indices, value)`. This is compatible with the sparse and dense vectors from `sage.modules`.

(Because a `Components` does not currently have a parent, it does not make sense to define the method `monomial_coefficients` - as defined by `ModulesWithBasis`.)

We also define `Matrix.items` with the same interface.

<a id='comment:9'></a>To clarify - here on this ticket, the data structure shouldn't be changed but instead methods added.

Sage mainly uses doctests - see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html
but there are also unit tests, which are invoked within the doctests by `TestSuite(...).run()`.
