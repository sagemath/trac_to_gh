When adding or subtracting a dense matrix and a sparse matrix, the resulting matrix is sparse in some cases.

```
sage: a = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=False)
sage: b = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=True)
sage: (a + b).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a.change_ring(QQ) + b).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a.change_ring(QQ) + b.change_ring(QQ)).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a + b.change_ring(QQ)).is_sparse()  # should also be False
True
```
This seems to happen when the rings are different and the common coercion parent of the rings is the ring of the sparse matrix.

The problem here seems to be that there is a coercion from the dense matrix space to the sparse one, so the sparse matrix space is discovered as a common parent:

```
sage: a = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=False)
sage: b = matrix.random(QQ, 3, sparse=True)
sage: b.parent().has_coerce_map_from(a.parent())
True
sage: coercion_model.common_parent(a, b)
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 sparse matrices over Rational Field
```

It would be better if the pushout were used here, as it correctly results in a dense matrix space:

```
sage: sage.categories.pushout.pushout(a.parent(), b.parent())
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
