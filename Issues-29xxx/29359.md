When adding or subtracting a dense matrix and a sparse matrix, the resulting matrix is sparse in some cases.

```
sage: a = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=False)
sage: b = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=True)
sage: (a + b).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a.change_ring(QQ) + b).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a.change_ring(QQ) + b.change_ring(QQ)).is_sparse()  # correct
False
sage: (a + b.change_ring(QQ)).is_sparse()  # should also be False
True
```
This seems to happen when the rings are different and the common coercion parent of the rings is the ring of the sparse matrix.


Component: **coercion**

The problem here seems to be that there is a coercion from the dense matrix space to the sparse one, so the sparse matrix space is discovered as a common parent:

```
sage: a = matrix.random(ZZ, 3, sparse=False)
sage: b = matrix.random(QQ, 3, sparse=True)
sage: b.parent().has_coerce_map_from(a.parent())
True
sage: coercion_model.common_parent(a, b)
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 sparse matrices over Rational Field
```

It would be better if the pushout were used here, as it correctly results in a dense matrix space:

```
sage: sage.categories.pushout.pushout(a.parent(), b.parent())
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
