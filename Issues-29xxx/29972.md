You replaced:

```diff
-    sage: x=0; l.count(x), ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))
-    (13355, 13298)
-    sage: x=4; l.count(x), ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))
-    (5479, 5467)
-    sage: x=-10; l.count(x), ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))
-    (53, 51)

+    13298
+    sage: x=4; ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))

+    51
+    sage: l.count(x)  # rel tol 5e-1
+    51
```
I would further rewrite that as:

```diff
+    sage: expected = lambda x: ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))
+    sage: observed = lambda x: l.count(x)
+    sage: expected(0)

+    sage: observed(4)  # rel tol 5e-2
+    5467
+    sage: expected(-10)
+    51
+    sage: observed(-10)  # rel tol 5e-1
+    51
```

You replaced:

```diff
-    sage: x=0;   y=1; float(l.count(x))/l.count(y), exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/exp(-y^2/(2*sigma^2)).n() # long time
-    (1.0, 1.00...)
-    sage: x=0; y=-100; float(l.count(x))/l.count(y), exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/exp(-y^2/(2*sigma^2)).n() # long time
-    (1.32..., 1.36...)
+    sage: x=0;   y=1; float(l.count(x))/l.count(y), exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/exp(-y^2/(2*sigma^2)).n()  # long time  # abs tol 2e-1
+    (1.0, 1.0)
+    sage: x=0; y=-100; float(l.count(x))/l.count(y), exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/exp(-y^2/(2*sigma^2)).n()  # long time  # abs tol 2e-1
+    (1.36, 1.36)
```
I would further rewrite that as:

```diff
+    sage: expected = lambda x, y: (
+    ....:     exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/exp(-y^2/(2*sigma^2)).n())
+    sage: observed = lambda x, y: float(l.count(x))/l.count(y)
+    sage: expected(0, 1), observed(0, 1)  # long time  # abs tol 2e-1
+    (1.0, 1.0)
+    sage: expected(0, -100), observed(0, -100)  # long time  # abs tol 2e-1
+    (1.36, 1.36)
```

In `src/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx` you add `set_random_seed(0)`
in front of some tests.

Is there an explanation somewhere of when to do that?
I did not find one at #29935.

Thanks for the above suggestions.

Yes, we agreed to avoid `set_random_seed(0)` if at all possible.
It is harder to fix this for doctests that you don't understand.
I removed this now.

This still fails too frequently (8 times out of 50). I understand the difficulty in making this work and I do not have a good solution either.

Setting the seed to 0 may be the only reliable solution, but I welcome other ideas and opinions. Or we just increase the tolerances enough for the tests to pass (almost) always.

When I was running a patchbot client, I fixed several flaky doctests just to get the patchbot to report usable results, which is a time consuming process. That is why I am wary about introducing new such issues.

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>\nYes, 8 out of 50 is definitely too much.\n\nMy idea was to have meaningful tests that fail about 1 in 10000 or less. That is how I did the tests in #29976. Run the corresponding function a couple thousand times and take the maximum and minimum.\n\nE.g. there is a doctest in matrices that tests that random `GF(2)` 1000 x 1000 matrices have high rank (because that was an issue that has been fixed at some point). Now theoretically, it could still have a very low rank, but I don't think this will happen.

Yes, 8 out of 50 is definitely too much.

My idea was to have meaningful tests that fail about 1 in 10000 or less. That is how I did the tests in #29976. Run the corresponding function a couple thousand times and take the maximum and minimum.

E.g. there is a doctest in matrices that tests that random `GF(2)` 1000 x 1000 matrices have high rank (because that was an issue that has been fixed at some point). Now theoretically, it could still have a very low rank, but I don't think this will happen. The new doctest is rather meaningful, I think, because it documents that such a matrix will very probably (at least 99.9%) have rank 995 or higher. Also the doctest now is actually being run.

Then I decided that a tolerance of `0.01` to make it almost never fail.
Of course there should

Sorry for all my comments.

Just forget what I said earlier. I still think that tests with `set_random_seed(0)` are pretty worthless, because they don't test anything.

However, doctests should be mathematically correct. So rethinking:

```
             sage: A = matrix(GF(2), 5, 5, 0)
             sage: A.randomize()
             sage: 1 <= len(A.nonzero_positions()) < 24
             True
```
is NOT a good test. Not because it is likely to fail, but because it boils down to something as:

```
sage: randint(0, 2^24) != 0
True
```
It probably won't fail, but it is terrible.

There is two reasons for doctests that I think should be kept in mind
- educational/documentation
- actually testing that things work (e.g. that random really does something).

**Here is my proposition:**

I think the way to combine those things is using while statements in those tests for "randomness". Those tests succeed almost certainly in a mathematical correct way:
- Testing that not all random elements are zero

```
sage: while GF(3).random_element().is_zero(): pass
```
- Testing that all (of finitely many) elements can be obtained eventually.
- Testing that random matrices over `GF(2)` have different ranks:

```
sage: def random_rank():
....:     A = matrix(GF(2), 5, 5, 0) 
....:     A.randomize() 
....:     return A.rank()
sage: while random_rank() < 5: pass
while while random_rank() >= 4: pass
```
- Testing that according to the law of large numbers an expectation is approximated at some point.

```
sage: from collections import defaultdict                                                                                             
sage: counter = defaultdict(Integer)                                                                                                  
sage: def throw_dice(): counter[randint(1, 6)] += 1                                                                                   
sage: throw_dice()                                                                                                                    
sage: def test(): return all((counter[i]*1.0/sum(counter.values()) - 1/6) < 0.01 for i in counter)                                    
sage: while not test(): inc() 
```
- Applying this to our situation this could look like:

```   
sage: from sage.stats.distributions.discrete_gaussian_integer import DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler   
sage: sigma = 3.0                                                                                                                     
sage: D = DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler(sigma=sigma)

```

Am I making any sense?

IMO this would actually be a valuable doctest and mathematically correct. Because the probability of this not terminating is indeed a zero probability (at least if things are implemented correctly).

One can maybe speed this up by increasing the initial sample and by adding a number of samples instead of just one at a time.

Very nice. This works well. 

I have tried the while loops manually to make sure they do not take too much time. Only this test in `discrete_gaussian_lattice` is sometimes a bit slow. This only happens rarely, but in one case it created more than 2 million samples.

```
sage: while abs(m*f(v)*1.0/c/counter[v] - 1.0) >= 0.2: add_samples(1000)  # long time
```
As this does not happen often, I think we can set this ticket to positive review, but you can change the bound of this test if you prefer.
