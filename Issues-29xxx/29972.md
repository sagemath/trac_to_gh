Ok, I made it a bit more flexible.

These doctests are really difficult to fix. As you noticed, it is far from stable.

In `src/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx` you add `set_random_seed(0)`
in front of some tests.

Is there an explanation somewhere of when to do that?
I did not find one at #29935.

Thanks for the above suggestions.

Yes, we agreed to avoid `set_random_seed(0)` if at all possible.
It is harder to fix this for doctests that you don't understand.
I removed this now.

I understand the difficulty in making this work and I do not have a good solution either. Personally, I have the impression that we should not write tests that are guaranteed to fail sporadically at all, especially considering the vast number of doctests in Sage. Every false positive adds noise to the development process, which can make real issues go unnoticed. Besides that, including a test in the documentation making false claims about a probability distribution is a bit confusing.\n\nSetting the seed to 0 may be the only reliable solution, but I welcome other ideas and opinions. Or we just increase the tolerances enough for the tests to pass (almost) always.\n\nWhen I was running a patchbot client, I fixed several flaky doctests just to get the patchbot to report usable results, which is a time consuming process. That is why I am wary about introducing new such issues.\n\n```\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13008 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13008 src/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13016 src/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13032 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13034 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13042 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13047 src/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\nsage -t --long --warn-long 134.9 --random-seed=13049 src/sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx  # 1 doctest failed\n```",

This still fails too frequently (8 times out of 50). I understand the difficulty in making this work and I do not have a good solution either. Personally, I have the impression that we should not write tests that are guaranteed to fail sporadically at all, especially considering the vast number of doctests in Sage. Every false positive adds noise to the development process, which can make real issues go unnoticed. Besides that, including a test in the documentation making false claims about a probability distribution is a bit confusing.

Setting the seed to 0 may be the only reliable solution, but I welcome other ideas and opinions. Or we just increase the tolerances enough for the tests to pass (almost) always.

When I was running a patchbot client, I fixed several flaky doctests just to get the patchbot to report usable results, which is a time consuming process. That is why I am wary about introducing new such issues.

```

Here is an example of something I feel comfortable with:

sage: def foo():

sage: max(foo() for _ in range(100))

Then I decided that a tolerance of `0.01` to make it almost never fail.
Of course there should 

```diff

```

Maybe tests failing 1 in a 100 000 are still acceptable. But everything significantly below that would be annoying. You don't want to restart your patchbot every 50 days, because of stupid failures.

And of course, if the test becomes meaningless by that kind of tolerance, we might want to go with `set_random_seed(0)`.

Sorry for all my comments.

Just forget what I said earlier. I still think that tests with `set_random_seed(0)` are pretty worthless, because they don't test anything.

However, doctests should be mathematically correct. So rethinking:

```
             sage: A = matrix(GF(2), 5, 5, 0)
             sage: A.randomize()
             sage: 1 <= len(A.nonzero_positions()) < 24
             True
```
is NOT a good test. Not because it is likely to fail, but because it boils down to something as:

```
sage: randint(0, 2^24) != 0
True
```
It probably won't fail, but it is terrible.

There is two reasons for doctests that I think should be kept in mind
- educational/documentation
- actually testing that things work (e.g. that random really does something).

**Here is my proposition:**

I think the way to combine those things is using while statements in those tests for "randomness". Those tests succeed almost certainly in a mathematical correct way:
- Testing that not all random elements are zero

```
sage: while GF(3).random_element().is_zero(): pass
```
- Testing that all (of finitely many) elements can be obtained eventually.
- Testing that random matrices over `GF(2)` have different ranks:

```
sage: def random_rank():
....:     A = matrix(GF(2), 5, 5, 0) 
....:     A.randomize() 
....:     return A.rank()
sage: while random_rank() < 5: pass
while while random_rank() >= 4: pass
```
- Testing that according to the law of large numbers an expectation is approximated at some point.

```
sage: from collections import defaultdict                                                                                             
sage: counter = defaultdict(Integer)                                                                                                  
sage: def throw_dice(): counter[randint(1, 6)] += 1                                                                                   
sage: throw_dice()                                                                                                                    
sage: def test(): return all((counter[i]*1.0/sum(counter.values()) - 1/6) < 0.01 for i in counter)                                    
sage: while not test(): inc() 
```
- Applying this to our situation this could look like:

```   
sage: from sage.stats.distributions.discrete_gaussian_integer import DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler   
sage: sigma = 3.0                                                                                                                     
sage: D = DiscreteGaussianDistributionIntegerSampler(sigma=sigma)                                                                     
sage: bound = (6*sigma).floor()                                                                                                       
sage: norm_factor = sum([exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2)) for x in range(-bound,bound+1)]) 
                                                      
sage: from collections import defaultdict                                                                                             
sage: counter = defaultdict(Integer)  
sage: n = 0                                                                                                 
sage: def add_sample():

sage: for _ in range(1000): add_sample()                                                                                                                                                                                  
sage: expected = lambda x : ZZ(round(n*exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))/norm_factor))                                                            
sage: observed = lambda x : counter[x]
                                                                                                
sage: while not counter[0]: add_sample()                                                                                              
sage: while abs(expected(0)*1.0/observed(0) - 1.0) > 5e-2: add_sample()  # long time  
                                                             
sage: while not counter[4]: add_sample()                                                                     
sage: while abs(expected(4)*1.0/observed(4) - 1.0) > 5e-2: add_sample()  # long time     
                                                          
sage: while not counter[-10]: add_sample()                                                                                            
sage: while abs(expected(-10)*1.0/observed(-10) - 1.0) > 5e-2: add_sample()  # long time                          
```

Am I making any sense?

IMO this would actually be a valuable doctest and mathematically correct. Because the probability of this not terminating is indeed a zero probability (at least if things are implemented correctly).

One can maybe speed this up by increasing the initial sample and by adding a number of samples instead of just one at a time.

Very nice. This works well. 

I have tried the while loops manually to make sure they do not take too much time. Only this test in `discrete_gaussian_lattice` is sometimes a bit slow. This only happens rarely, but in one case it created more than 2 million samples.

```
sage: while abs(m*f(v)*1.0/c/counter[v] - 1.0) >= 0.2: add_samples(1000)  # long time
```
As this does not happen often, I think we can set this ticket to positive review, but you can change the bound of this test if you prefer.
