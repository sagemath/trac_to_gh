```
We fix several issues involving `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`:

- `numpy` intrinsics need a special build flag in this mode

- `ntl` needs to disable use of a problematic instruction set

- After #31064, the GH Actions tests for `cygwin` did not pass SAGE_FAT_BINARY to the actual build, randomly causing SIGILLs when a partial build was passed to the next stage through the `sage-local` artifact



Depends on #31493

From `NTL/doc/tour-win.html`:

```
152 Configuration flags.
153 </b>
154 <p>
155 
156 Also in directory "<tt>include/NTL</tt>" is a file called "<tt>config.h</tt>".
157 You can edit this file to override some of NTL's default options
158 for basic configuration and performance.
159 Again, the defaults should be good for
160 Windows with MSVC++.
```

In `config.h` there is a couple of flags that needs to be set by hand apparently.

Those look like they might make problems:

```
195 #if 0
196 #define NTL_CLEAN_INT
197 
198 /*
199  *   This will disallow the use of some non-standard integer arithmetic
200  *   that may improve performance somewhat.
201  *
202  */
203 
204 #endif
205 
206 #if 1
207 #define NTL_CLEAN_PTR
208 
209 /*
210  *   This will disallow the use of some non-standard pointer arithmetic
211  *   that may improve performance somewhat.
212  *
213  */
214 
215 #endif
216 
217 #if 1
218 #define NTL_SAFE_VECTORS
219 
220 /*
221  * This will compile NTL in "safe vector" mode, only assuming
222  * the relocatability property for trivial types and types
223  * explicitly declared relocatable.  See vector.txt for more details.
224  */
225 
226 #endif
227 
228 #if 0
229 #define NTL_ENABLE_AVX_FFT
230 
231 /*
232  * This will compile NTL in a way that enables an AVX implemention
233  * of the small-prime FFT.
234  */
235 
236 #endif
237 
238 
239 #if 0
240 #define NTL_AVOID_AVX512
241  
242 /*
243  * This will compile NTL in a way that avoids 512-bit operations,
244  * even if AVX512 is available.
245  */
246 
247 #endif
248  
249 #if 0
250 #define NTL_RANGE_CHECK
251 
252 /*

The relevant configuration is done in `src/DoConfig`, which is unfortunately perl (yet another language whichs syntax I do not understand).

But one might even define those things as environment variables and this might be passed through??

In `src/DoConfig` there is the following list:

```
 55 %ConfigFlag = (
 56 
 57 'NTL_LEGACY_NO_NAMESPACE' => 'off',
 58 'NTL_LEGACY_INPUT_ERROR'  => 'off',
 59 'NTL_DISABLE_LONGDOUBLE'  => 'off',
 60 'NTL_DISABLE_LONGLONG'    => 'off',
 61 'NTL_DISABLE_LL_ASM'      => 'off',
 62 'NTL_MAXIMIZE_SP_NBITS'   => 'off',
 63 'NTL_LEGACY_SP_MULMOD'    => 'off',

 69 'NTL_DISABLE_MOVE_ASSIGN' => 'on',

 75 'NTL_NO_X86_FIX'          => 'off',
 76 'NTL_NO_INIT_TRANS'       => 'on',
 77 'NTL_CLEAN_INT'           => 'off',
 78 'NTL_CLEAN_PTR'           => 'on',
 79 'NTL_SAFE_VECTORS'        => 'on',
 80 'NTL_RANGE_CHECK'         => 'off',
 81 'NTL_ENABLE_AVX_FFT'      => 'off',
 82 'NTL_AVOID_AVX512'        => 'off',
 83 
 84 
 85 'NTL_SPMM_ULL'            => 'off',
 86 'NTL_AVOID_BRANCHING'     => 'off',
 87 'NTL_FFT_BIGTAB'          => 'off',
 88 'NTL_FFT_LAZYMUL'         => 'off',
 89 'NTL_TBL_REM'             => 'off',
 90 'NTL_CRT_ALTCODE'         => 'off',
 91 'NTL_CRT_ALTCODE_SMALL'   => 'off',
 92 'NTL_GF2X_NOINLINE'       => 'off',
 93 'NTL_GF2X_ALTCODE'        => 'off',
 94 'NTL_GF2X_ALTCODE1'       => 'off',
 95 
 96 
 97 );
```

What makes me thing that it might be AVX512 related, is that we haven't encountered this before. Github workflows is the only place where I encountered processors capable of AVX512.

I have encountered a similar problem again on Cygwin. This time it seems to come from OpenBLAS. 

The Cygwin build takes place in multiple stages, passing on partial builds of $SAGE_LOCAL to the next stages via artifacts.
I have now seen several instances (latest: 
in which the artifacts contain native instructions that lead to SIGILL on use in the next stage.

For example, in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2029013426?check_suite_focus=true aborts early in the sagelib build. On a local machine I can reproduce it as well by downloading the artifact. Using `gdb` it can be seen that merely importing some `numpy` modules already gives `SIGILL`.

Perhaps the latest change to OpenBLAS in #22179 needs revisiting.

This might also be related to https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/57

NTL is working now on sage-windows, but I suspect there is a portability issue with OpenBLAS (thought it is resulting in segfaults, apparently, not illegal instructions).

> Erik, in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/s_inhvSxLp8/m/Vtb35oYcAgAJ you say you have fixed it in the windows binary build --- what's the solution?

The issue on the NTL side was fixed: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/53

The solution was to not use the NTL package from Cygwin and custom compile it instead.

I also brought the issue up with the package maintainer: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2020-December/247196.html

He has released a new version of the package to address it: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2020-December/247205.html

He still rebuilt it, with my perhaps fault suggestion of including `CXXFLAGS=-mavx`, which others have rightfully pointed out will still make it less portable, though I think that's how I built it as well.

He released another new NTL package in January but I'm not sure whether or not it changes anything about this: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2021-January/247439.html

The NTL fix definitely worked for some, but others are still reporting segfaults in plotting, so I think that has to do either with OpenBLAS or Numpy, but I haven't been able to gather enough details: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/57

Do we know anything about the CPU architecture of the machines these builds are being run on?  I looked through the logs but didn't find anything.  It might be helpful to add a `cat /proc/cpuinfo` somewhere.

Worth a look in part because Numpy with OpenBLAS 0.3.12 was causing segfaults, so they reverted to OpenBLAS 0.3.9: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17680 

We are using 0.3.13 which might also have problems with Numpy, though I wish I had more insight into what those problems actually are.

From the logs from the previous stage of that run:

```
Copying package files from temporary location /opt/sage-461876e6c77b59756ad9db557c884486eb40881e/var/tmp/sage/build/cython-0.29.21/inst to /opt/sage-461876e6c77b59756ad9db557c884486eb40881e
Waiting for rebase lock
Getting list of dlls. This may take a while...
Now rebasing...
Successfully installed cython-0.29.21

So that's mysterious.

On [this build](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2129378838?check_suite_focus=true) I notice during "Extract sage-local artifact":

```
Filesystem       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
C:/tools/cygwin  256G  170G   86G  67% /
D:                14G  2.2G   12G  16% /cygdrive/d
Getting list of dlls. This may take a while...
Now rebasing...
rebaseall: only ash or dash processes are allowed during rebasing
    Exit all Cygwin processes and stop all Cygwin services.
    Execute ash (or dash) from Start/Run... or a cmd or command window.
    Execute '/bin/rebaseall' from ash (or dash).
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

If you want to do a full rebase in this step it can't be called from a shell script run with /bin/bash.  The script either needs to be run with dash, or as a separate command with dash.

Ah, OK.  I think that's a good idea.  It just needs to be run outside a Cygwin process with no other Cygwin processes running (since it can also modify the cygwin DLL itself and other support libraries that are not normally touched by plain `rebase`).
