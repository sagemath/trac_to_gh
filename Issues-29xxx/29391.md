```
Python 3 has new keywords which the preparser does not know yet:

```
sage: import keyword
sage: [a for a in keyword.kwlist if a not in sage.repl.preparse.keywords]
['False', 'None', 'True', 'async', 'await', 'nonlocal']
```

As a result, preparsing of these keywords conflicts with implicit multiplication:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: preparse("nonlocal a")
'nonlocal*a'
```

In Python 2, the lists `keyword.kwlist` and `sage.repl.preparse.keywords` are the same up to ordering, so this ticket removes the latter and rewrites the keyword checks using the [keyword module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/keyword.html#module-keyword).

A consequence of these changes is that implicit multiplication of literal booleans is not supported anymore:

```
sage: True True   # previously, this returned 1
...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

For the Python 2 keywords `print` and `exec`, implicit multiplication is still avoided with Python 3 in order to keep the error message:

```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello')?
```

- As you already (implicitly) mentioned, part of the problem is not due to python3:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: True True
1
```

  I don't think this is the desired behavior and I think the ticket description should include this case.

- More importantly, the reverse check gives us the following

```
sage: [a for a in sage.repl.preparse.keywords if not a in keyword.kwlist]
['print', 'exec']
```
  This means that with this ticket `print 2` will raise a `TypeError` and no longer a `SyntaxError`. Same for `exec 2+2` when implicit multiplication is set.

- While at it, we should really fix that at the moment implicit multiplication destroys the ipython magics:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(10)
sage: cd Documents
```
  will raise a `NameError` because it tries to multiply `ls` with `Documents`.
  So when replacing spaces with `*` we should really make sure that whatever is before the first space is not a keyword in `get_ipython().magics_manager.magics['line']` (I don't know exactly how do this outside of the interactive shell yet).

Can the IPython magics be used in a non-interactive setting? IIRC, only the interactive shells use a backend that inherits from `BackendIPython`.

I suggest to move this problem to a separate ticket. I am not entirely sure what the correct thing to do here is. For example it would be reasonable to expect the output

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: ab, cd = 3, 2
sage: cd ab
6
```
rather than switching to a directory named `ab`. This example is artificial, of course, and even without implicit multiplication, the IPython magic would fail in this case because of the variable `cd` in scope. The preparser cannot know about the context of a line without evaluating the code, though, so one would have to decide whether IPython automagics in general overrule implicit multiplication or not (possibly depending on the `level`).

One could also use the more robust (non-automagic) syntax

```
sage: %cd Documents
```

If I type `print hello` I get a nice error message

```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('hello')?
```
I figured, it would be nice to stay that way.

Then I would suggest to leave a message in the docstring of `implicit_multiplication` that this implicitly turns off automagic for level >= 3.

I think (after looking into it) the class `SageCustomizations` in `ipython_extensions` would be able to pass `self.shell`down to preparse, but this might be a lot of work and I agree that it is not a subject of this ticket. I think it's fine, if it is documented that automagic won't work anymore (except for `%time`, which is was manually excluded).

Otherwise, the ticket looks fine.

Ok, `print` is a very special case due to the switch from Python 2 to 3, so this error message is more likely to be useful. I have added `print` and `exec` again.

> Then I would suggest to leave a message in the docstring of `implicit_multiplication` that this implicitly turns off automagic for level >= 3.


Done. Thank you for the suggestions.

Ok, thanks. One more thing:

At the moment all the documentation is in `implicit_mul` and not in `implicit_multiplication` including the definition of the `level` and the comment about the automagic.

Wouldn't it be better the other way around as `implicit_multiplication` is the function in the namespace?

I propose the following change yet:

```diff
     <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-automagic>`_
     feature cannot be used if ``level >= 3``::
 
-        sage: from sage.repl.preparse import implicit_mul
-        sage: implicit_mul('cd Documents', level=3)
+        sage: implicit_multiplication(3)
+        sage: preparse('cd Documents')
         'cd*Documents'
-        sage: implicit_mul('cd Documents', level=2)
+        sage: implicit_multiplication(2)
+        sage: preparse('cd Documents')
         'cd Documents'
+        sage: implicit_multiplication(False)
```

This is more consistent with the other doctests in `implicit_multiplication` (as `implicit_mul` is never mentioned). Once done, you can put it on positive review on my behalf.

Note that the last line is needed to make later doctests work.
