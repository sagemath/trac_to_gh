This ticket adds an intersphinx mapping for Sphinx to resolve hyperlinks to the Scipy documentation.

With this change, Sphinx fetches the Scipy inventory file `objects.inv` from https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ during the docbuild. It links against the latest version of the Scipy documentation to keep it simple.

If the download fails, for example when building Sage without internet access, the docbuild will still succeed, but the Scipy cross-links will not be resolved.

With these changes applied, I have successfully built the documentation without internet access.

+1.

Though, it would be great that something like <code>:obj:\`scipy:scipy.integrate.ode\`</code> in Sage documentation resolves correctly (either pointing to the local documentation or online). `pplpy` intersphinx relies on the fact that its documentation is built and installed. This is implemented in `build/pkgs/pplpy/spkg-postinst`

```
$ cat build/pkgs/pplpy/spkg-postinst 
if [[ "$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" != no ]] ; then
    # Compile pplpy's documentation
    cd src
    cd docs
    $MAKE html

    # install pplpy's documentation
    PPLPY_DOCS=$SAGE_SHARE/doc/pplpy
    mkdir -p $PPLPY_DOCS
    cp -r build/html/*  $PPLPY_DOCS
fi
```
Though, if we start allowing for `pplpy` to come from the system the `intersphinx` will be broken and that also needs a solution.

I would suggest to change the pplpy intersphinx mapping to point to the online version of the pplpy documentation instead of the local version. The local inventory file can be used as fallback (and the dummy file as secondary fallback). This ensures that cross-links (to the online version) can still be resolved correctly if either an internet connection or the local pplpy documentation exists during the docbuild.

Admittedly, it might be better if the cross-links resolved to the local documentation in the case when the local objects.inv is used, and to the online documentation if the online version is used, but there does not seem to be an easy way to configure this, as far as I understand.

This proposal is not acceptable. Building Sage should not trigger any internet connection beyond downloading packages (that can be done prior to the build with `sage -d`).

One option would actually be to package the various inventories. But that look tedious to maintain.

What's the status of this?  There has been discussion of this recently again, and it would be good to do at least *something* about it, as I need this for #31404 as well.

I think currently this looks good--one thing I might change is for the dummy fallback see if the docs are installed locally first (e.g. if pplpy was installed with `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS`, then we can find its docs in `SAGE_SHARE/doc/pplpy`).

I think this is better than nothing for now.
