We move the method `vertex_facet_graph` from `Polyhedron_base` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

Along the way we fix an bug, namely that `vertex_facet_graph(labels=False)` has the edges the wrong way::

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.vertex_facet_graph().is_isomorphic(P.vertex_facet_graph(False))
False
sage: P.vertex_facet_graph().is_isomorphic(P.vertex_facet_graph(False).reverse())
True
```

Then, I would just swap the two examples to show the default behavior first. 

Could you make this sentence more clear:

```
If ``names`` is ``True`` but no names are provided,
```

I would suggest to put `If names is True (the default) but no names...`.
