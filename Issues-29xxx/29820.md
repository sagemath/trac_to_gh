With this ticket, through the methods <code>:meth:\`~sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor.display\`</code> and <code>:meth:\`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField.display\`</code>, SageMath is now able to compact the display of tensor product in the form `dx^2`. In the case the frame element is something like `f^2`, to avoid any misunderstanding in `f<sup>2</sup>2`, one can set `compact_product=False` in display to get the old displaying style `f<sup>2*f</sup>2`.

Raising a tensor field to a given power is also possible now. When the tensor is an automorphism field the composition law of maps is used instead of tensor product and in this case, raising to a nonpositive power is possible.
