This ticket adds an spkg-configure.m4 for pynac, in order to use it from a system package if possible (see #27330).

Remark: it works as-is when pynac has been built without giac, i.e. if --without-giac has been set (when giac is installed, pynac finds and uses it by default). And if pynac has been built against giac, src/module_list.py must be patched.
