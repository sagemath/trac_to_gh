Our documentation and tests include a variety of
examples and tests involving randomness.

Those depend on a randomness seed, and up to Sage 9.1
they always used the same one: 0. Thus every run
of `sage -t` or `make [p]test[all][long]` would run
those "random" doctests deterministically.
In many cases, the output of those tests even relied
on that. As a result, random examples and tests
were actually testing that they were run non-randomly!

This is reminiscent of
an [xkcd comic illustration of random number generators](https://xkcd.com/221/).

Based on these considerations and the
related [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/c4UbKSdt3Aw/UQAo1iYoAAAJ),
we propose to:

- allow specifying a randomness when running tests (#29962),
- adapt tests involving randomness, making sure they
  test mathematical functionality independent of
  the randomness seed used to run them (see roadmap),
- default to a random randomness seed when none is specified
  (present ticket),

thus making those tests more robust and more useful,
by becoming more likely to reveal bugs in a variety
of cases including corner cases.

The first step (see #29962, merged in Sage 9.2)
adds a `--random-seed` flag to `sage -t`, allowing:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/
```

Still, when no randomness seed is specified,
the default seed 0 is used. This means most testers
test with the same randomness seed, making "random"
doctests still mostly deterministic in practice.

Here is a way to pick a random randomness seed
and run tests with it (can be used to work on
the tickets in the roadmap):

```
$ randseed() {
    sage -c "import sage.misc.randstate as randstate; \
             randstate.set_random_seed(); \
             print(randstate.initial_seed())";
    }
$ SEED=$(randseed)
$ DIR=src/sage
$ echo "$ sage -t --long --random-seed=${SEED} ${DIR}" \
  && ./sage -t --long --random-seed=${SEED} ${DIR}
```

Once examples and tests involving randomness
have been adapted, the present ticket puts
the final touch by making it so that
when running tests with no seed specified,
a random one will be used:

```
sage -t src/sage/all.py 
Running doctests with ID 2020-06-23-23-19-03-8003eea5.
...
sage -t --warn-long 89.5 --random-seed=273987373473433732996760115183658447263 src/sage/all.py
    [16 tests, 0.73 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 0.8 seconds
    cpu time: 0.7 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
```

Being displayed in the output, the seed used
can be used again if needed:

```
sage -t --warn-long 89.5 --random-seed=273987373473433732996760115183658447263 src/sage/all.py
```
allowing to explore any problematic case
revealed by running the tests with that seed.

this is a great example of fuzzing catching an apparent error, it seems.

You can reproduce this test with

+1.

Also note that Sage still uses a verbatim copy of the Python-2 version of the `Random` module during doctesting, which was necessary in order to obtain consistent results between Python 2 and 3. This is why the bug in #29550 went unnoticed, for example. Now that support for Python 2 has been removed, we should switch to the Python 3 version of `Random`. This will require updating lots of doctests, but I assume this ticket here will simplify this if it makes doctests less dependent on the seed/RNG.

<a id='comment:48'></a>It may be too late for this, but I would suggest a staged approach:

- ticket 1: implement optional random seed but don't make it the default
- tickets 2-n: fix doctests when using random seeds in various parts of the Sage library
- ticket n+1: make random seed standard, if that is what people think should be done

Doing everything all at once is likely to lead to a patch bomb, which will lead to merge conflicts and in general be hard to deal with.

I prefer

as this makes it a bit easier for the user to see, what will/might happen. But that is only minor.

However, I just noticed, that there are problems with that approach. The representation of those random things will never be checked. In principal (almost) all random events should be reproducible with some random seed (doesn't work for e.g. hashing).

Now if you tag something as `# random-seed=0` and we find some way to test this (both seed 0 and different), it would mean that the printed representations stay up to date and consistent and it is also tested, if those thing work for "random" input.

I found many examples where functions where tested assuming random seed 0. One could make use of the double testing framework:

```
def foo(y):

   EXAMPLES::

      sage: M = random(); M  # random-seed=0

      <some random output>
      sage: check_for_consistency(M, N)

   return _foo(y)
```
It is still checked, that `foo` works exactly for some example that hopefully was verified by someone. But it is also checked, that the method in principal works on "random" input and that the output appears to be correct.

Use a correct random approach (e.g. random unimodular) and check that indeed `A*x == v`. Optionally one can print `x` and `A` and tag this as random. To be honest, I don't see how a user would profit from the printing. What a 3 by 3 matrix looks like should be clear by then.",

Sounds good to me. As for the documentation of `random_element`, I don't think a user cares about the precise value of `set_random_seed(0); C.random_element()`.

Two more cases that I would like to discuss.

- Basically from[comment:60](#comment%3A60). How do we deal with something like this:

```
def foo(y):
   r"""
   EXAMPLES::

      sage: M = random(); M
      <some random input>
      sage: foo(M)
      <some random output>
   """
```
  It appears to me that there are many examples, where someone did not write down a concrete element to doctest. I would propose having two doctests, if possible:
- Explicitly obtain the old test.
- Have a "random" test with a consistency check. (Even without a consistency check, it's probably worth checking that the function terminates without an error usually.)
- The other one is a concrete example from #29981 (linear algrebra tutorial). The original test is

```
    sage: A=random_matrix(QQ,3)
    sage: v=vector([2,3,1])
    sage: A,v
    (
    [ 0 -1  1]
    [-1 -1 -1]
    [ 0  2  2], (2, 3, 1)
    )
    sage: x=A\v; x
    (-7/2, -3/4, 5/4)
    sage: A*x
    (2, 3, 1)
```
  As mentioned already, this does not work. I see basically two ways of fixing this. One is to explicitly write down `A`. The other one is similar to what I did. Use a correct random approach (e.g. random unimodular) and check that indeed `A*x == v`. Optionally one can print `x` and `A` and tag this as random. To be honest, I don't see how a user would profit from the printing. What a 3 by 3 matrix looks like should be clear by then.

If the point isn't to demonstrate the `random()` function, then the "random" element can just be replaced with whatever it winds up with now (i.e. the fixed element you get with a seed of zero).
The `TESTS` block can contain some truly random test of a property that the output from `foo()` should satisfy, like

```
sage: foo(random()) in RR
True
```

How about...

```
sage: A = random_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: while not A.is_invertible():
....:     A = random_matrix(QQ,3)
....:     
sage: v=vector([2,3,1])
sage: x=A\v
sage: A*x - v == 0
True
```

-Currently doctests are run completely deterministically, as they always start from the same random seed.
+Our documentation and tests include a variety of
+examples and tests involving randomness.
 
-We propose to start from a "random" random seed, thus making those tests more robust and more useful.
+Those depend on a randomness seed, and up to Sage 9.1
+they always used the same one: 0. Thus every run
+of `sage -t` or `make [p]test[all][long]` would run
+those "random" doctests deterministically.
+In many cases, the output of those tests even relied
+on that. As a result, random examples and tests
+were actually testing that they were run non-randomly!
 
-See  this sage-devel thread for more details:
+This is reminiscent of
+an [xkcd comic illustration of random number generators](https://xkcd.com/221/).

+Based on these considerations and the
+related [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/c4UbKSdt3Aw/UQAo1iYoAAAJ),
+we propose to:
 
-If not set, a random seed will be chosen for doctesting:
+- allow specifying a randomness when running tests (#29962),
+- adapt tests involving randomness, making sure they
+  test mathematical functionality independent of
+  the randomness seed used to run them (see roadmap),
+- default to a random randomness seed when none is specified
+  (present ticket),
+
+thus making those tests more robust and more useful,
+by becoming more likely to reveal bugs in a variety
+of cases including corner cases.
+
+The first step (see #29962, merged in Sage 9.2)
+adds a `--random-seed` flag to `sage -t`, allowing:
+
+```
+sage -t --long --random-seed=9876543210 src/sage/
+```
+
+Still, when no randomness seed is specified,
+the default seed 0 is used. This means most testers
+test with the same randomness seed, making "random"
+doctests still mostly deterministic in practice.
+
+Here is a way to pick a random randomness seed
+and run tests with it (can be used to work on
+the tickets in the roadmap):
+
+```
+$ randseed() {
+    sage -c "import sage.misc.randstate as randstate; \
+             randstate.set_random_seed(); \
+             print(randstate.initial_seed())";
+    }
+$ SEED=$(randseed)
+$ DIR=src/sage
+$ echo "$ sage -t --long --random-seed=${SEED} ${DIR}" \
+  && ./sage -t --long --random-seed=${SEED} ${DIR}
+```
+
+Once examples and tests involving randomness
+have been adapted, the present ticket puts
+the final touch by making it so that
+when running tests with no seed specified,
+a random one will be used:

<a id='comment:4'></a>I think this,

```patch
         ....:     n = ZZ.random_element().abs() + 5
+        ....:     if n > 5000:  # avoid timeouts
+        ....:         continue
```

can be simplified by passing `(5,5001)` as the bound to `ZZ.random_element()`, without abs.

And the fix for this has already been merged:

```patch
+        sage: test_symbolic_expression_order(10000)  # long time,  # not tested, known bug (see :trac:`32185`)
```

It seems that there is still a problem.  With some seeds, testing `generic_graph.py` takes about 16 seconds on my computer.  However,

```
sage -t --random-seed=236024484355828254371843550334759500607 src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
```
times out.  I attached the log.  The last line executed is

```
sage: trees = g.edge_disjoint_spanning_trees(k) ## line 6282 ##
```

Of course, this should not have anything to do with the SEP.
