In #26421 factorization of polynomials has been extended to previously untreated cases in which the polynomial's base ring is an integral domain.
The factorization is done over the field of fraction and excepted if it can be coerced into the base ring itself. Since the method `base_change` of the class `Factorzation` doesn't check if the unit of the factorization is coerced to a unit again, this implementation is too vastly:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: P.<x> = R[]
sage: f = 2*x + 4
sage: f.is_irreducible()
True
sage: F = f.factor(); F
(2) * (x + 2)
sage: F.unit()
2
```

Maybe a better place for the fix would be the method `base_change` of the class `Factorization`. But since this leads to the failure of previous doctests (in cases `is_unit` is not implemented), I preferred the implementation in method `factor`.

One little change: "coerce" to "convert". If it was a coercion map, then the fact it was a unit must be preserved (as coercions must be morphisms). Once you change that, you can set a positive review.
