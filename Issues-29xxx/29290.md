Installing sage 9.1.beta6 on Cygwin currently chokes on sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/mod_sym_num.c (which comes from sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/mod_sym_num.pyx):

... and tons and tons of other errors that all seem to come from `_N` attributes in that pyx file.

I don't understand C well enough to trace this back to its origins, but it looks like a clash of variable names.
