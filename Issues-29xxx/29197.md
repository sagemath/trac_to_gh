I tried on my macOS laptop, but I had to install mcqd first, so it's not a good test. Someone else should try, or tell me which sequence of operation I have to do.

`make` also succeeded with the branch here, and so did `./sage -f mcqd`, so it didn't break anything. Is there any reason to bump up the package patch-level?
