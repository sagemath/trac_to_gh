I tried on my linux computer and it seems that it fixes the problem (compilation no longer complaining).

I tried on my macOS laptop, but I had to install mcqd first, so it's not a good test. Someone else should try, or tell me which sequence of operation I have to do.

I can't reproduce any problem with OS X: I took 9.1.beta3, installed mcqd, then did `git trac pull develop` to get to 9.1.beta4. `make` succeeded.

`make` also succeeded with the branch here, and so did `./sage -f mcqd`, so it didn't break anything. Is there any reason to bump up the package patch-level?

It could be that MacOS just doesn't need `-fPIC`.

While we're at it, it's good to understand whether `mcqd` was updated after out release.
I'll take a look now.
