The viewer.png_viewer() and viewer.png_viewer() are directed to '/usr/bin/firefox', which is not an existing path on the system. Why was this changed from the 'xdg-open' in the new release sage                                                                                                                                                                          'SageMath version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01'?
How can I restore it to the previous 'xdg-open' pemanently?

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A2):

Yes, I checked that and it was set to Firefox and I didn't change it to my new browser. If I wanted to open the image with the standard image viewer that in my case is Gwenview (which was the default behaviour before) how can I do that?

Try unsetting that variable and see if that helps. The variable `SAGE_BROWSER` should also be unset.

I don't have the SAGE_BROWER variable set, unsetting the BROWSER variable seems to produce correctly the previous behavior to let the output to be opened with xdg-open.
In my specific case I run KDE so the variable was set in /etc/xdg/plasma-workspace/env and can be modified/removed there.
However I guess that the fact it starts with browser has to do with some change in the 9.0 from pacman because I didn't have such behavior before.
Another interesting thing to me in order to have a workaround could be to change where the png files are saved temporarily.

I don't know when `/etc/xdg/plasma-workspace/env` gets executed, before or after your shell profile scripts, but you could put `unset BROWSER` in `.profile` or `.bashrc` or similar.

In any case, I propose to close this ticket: it is not a bug in Sage.
