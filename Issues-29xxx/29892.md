In fact, we have 2 copies of `coeff_repr` and `repr_lincomb`: one in `sage.misc.misc`, one in `sage.misc.latex`.  Perhaps they can be merged in a follow up ticket as well; and perhaps even #14509 be fixed...

`sage.structure.formal_sum.FormalSum._latex_` has a comment (from nthiery 2012):

```
        return sage.misc.latex.repr_lincomb(symbols, coeffs)
        # TODO: finish merging sage.misc.latex.repr_lincomb and
        # sage.misc.misc.repr_lincomb and use instead:
        # return sage.misc.misc.repr_lincomb([[t,c] for c,t in self], is_latex=True)
```

Also `sage.modular.modsym.element`:

```
        # TODO: use repr_lincomb with is_latex=True
        return latex.repr_lincomb(v, c)
```

This ticket is part of an effort to reduce `sage.misc.misc`, motivated by #29865 (Modularization of sagelib: Break out a separate package `sage-objects`)
