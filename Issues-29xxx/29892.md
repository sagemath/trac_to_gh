In fact, we have 2 copies of `coeff_repr` and `repr_lincomb`: one in `sage.misc.misc`, one in `sage.misc.latex`.  Perhaps they can be merged in a follow up ticket as well; and perhaps even #14509 be fixed...

`sage.structure.formal_sum.FormalSum._latex_` has a comment (from nthiery 2012):

```
        return sage.misc.latex.repr_lincomb(symbols, coeffs)
        # TODO: finish merging sage.misc.latex.repr_lincomb and
        # sage.misc.misc.repr_lincomb and use instead:
        # return sage.misc.misc.repr_lincomb([[t,c] for c,t in self], is_latex=True)
```

Also `sage.modular.modsym.element`:

```
        # TODO: use repr_lincomb with is_latex=True
        return latex.repr_lincomb(v, c)
```

This ticket is part of an effort to reduce `sage.misc.misc`, motivated by #29865 (Modularization of sagelib: Break out a separate package `sage-objects`)

<a id='comment:20'></a>I agree with every change except for 08fedfa. This is used:

```
sage: CartanType.options.notation='Kac'
sage: CartanType(['BC', 4, 2]).dual()
['A', 8, 2]^+
sage: CartanType(['BC', 4, 2]).dual()._repr_(compact=True)
'A8^2+'

sage: CartanType.options.notation='Stembridge'
sage: CartanType(['BC', 4, 2]).dual()
['BC', 4, 2]^*
sage: CartanType(['BC', 4, 2]).dual()._repr_(compact=True)
'BC4~*'
```
It is suppose to represent the notation for affine Cartan type introduced by Kac of A<sub>2n</sub><sup>(2)\dagger</sup>. There probably should be a doctest showing this though...
