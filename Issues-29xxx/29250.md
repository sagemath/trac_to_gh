Before commandeering #29192 to add a new option to set the camera viewpoint, there are several points of cleanup that should be addressed:

1) In the file plot3d/base.pyx the dictionary `js_options` is created a number of lines distant from where options are actually set. This struck me as double maintenance of lists, so I moved creation of this dictionary up in the file and set its entries immediately. This also makes explicit in one spot which options are being sent to the Three.js template.

2) The variable names `aspect_ratio` and `axes_labels` are currently carried over into the Three.js template. Since camel case is more common for JavaScript people, I renamed these in the template.

3) A couple CSS improvements inspired by the current branch of #29192 are included here

4) The data for the viewpoint is overly precise: no one needs ten decimal places to set orientations in a graphic. The numerical values have been rounded to sufficient values.

This cleanup should be merged separately from #29192 for clarity.

Eric, if you have a notebook that stress-test overall options, then please test this ticket with it. I'm quite sure I caught all the options, but a second set of eyes is always useful.

Joshua, after this ticket is merged I'll push a branch to #29192 to add the camera viewpoint setting. Please make sure you have all of your original code before I overwrite the public branch!

Just finished testing these changes myself without issue so you have my vote. :) 

One question I do have, though: you added some rounding with the "get viewpoint" data and also removed a space in the resulting string. I'm wondering if maybe someone is feeding this info into a script, program, or database and the formatting changes might break that?

The format of the viewpoint data is set by this [tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/geometry/polytope_tikz.html) using tikz. It's all copy and paste right now.
