I am getting concerned that a rather unusual feature of gentoo may need additional description. The useflags. While packages in binary distro are built with all possible options [and when that is not possible either the best sets or variants of the package are offered] in Gentoo we leave the end user to choose a number of options by themselves.

A list of useflags for Gentoo is at https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/package.use/sage - some of the packages - pplpy, pynac and lcalc - are not in the main gentoo tree, only in the sage-on-gentoo overlay.

The dependency syntax for Gentoo includes the USE flags in square brackets after the package name, like `media-libs/gd[jpeg,png]`. I noticed that we're going to need that information, but I'm not sure where/how these text files are meant to be displayed to the end user, so I'm not sure of "dependency" format or package.use format is better.

One idea I had was that, until all of sage is packaged, maybe we could have people create a local package set called `@`sagemath:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets

If gentoo.txt contains entries like `media-libs/gd[jpeg,png]`, then we could tell users to `cat build/pkgs/*/distros/gentoo.txt > /etc/portage/sets/sagemath` and then `emerge --autounmask-use --autounmask-write `@`sagemath` would automatically add those flags to package.use before installing the associated packages. That lets us use dependency syntax, and portage takes care of turning it into package.use entries.

That's how I'm keeping track of my system-sage packages for now. Package sets are a bad substitute for a meta package, but they're easier for non-technical users to create and manage.

OTOH, it may be simpler with package.use format to just specify a list of USE flags that works. Saying "we need this and this and this... you figure it out" is elegant, but experience has taught me that sometimes you just need to be able to tell the computer to "shut up and use this."

The things inside the square brackets are the names of USE flags, not packages. So `foo/bar[baz,buz]` says that we need the package `foo/bar` built with both `USE=baz` and `USE=buz` set. Sometimes the USE flag names match up with package names, but ideally (and in general) they won't.

get the list of packages from all these gentoo.txt files, and run, as root,

`emerge --ask <this list>` 

e.g. `emerge --ask dev-lang/python foo/bar baz`

this is interactive, and you either will get an error, or a prompt inviting you to start the installation. cf https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Cheat_Sheet etc

<div id="comment:33" align="right">comment:33</div>

In addition to the fix in the last commit,
on the lxc gentoo/current image I picked on https://uk.images.linuxcontainers.org/, I needed to add

``` 
sci-mathematics/arb
sci-mathematics/flint
sci-mathematics/cliquer
sci-libs/m4ri
sci-mathematics/planarity
media-gfx/tachyon
```
to `/etc/portage/package.keywords`, as these packages are masked with `~amd64`.
Perhaps there is a quicker way to accomplish this.

`givaro` needed  agreeing to a license treatment, i.e.

```
# required by sci-libs/givaro (argument)
>=sci-libs/givaro-4.1.1 CeCILL-B
```
added to `/etc/portage/package.license`.
And, naturally, `etc-update` had to be run a number of times, resulting in
`/etc/portage/package.use/zz-autounmask` getting

```
# package.use# required by sci-mathematics/flint[ntl] (argument)
>=sci-mathematics/flint-2.5.2-r1 ntl
# required by dev-lang/R-3.4.1::gentoo
# required by dev-lang/R (argument)
>=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.11-r2 minizip
# required by m4ri[png] (argument)
>=sci-libs/m4ri-20200115 png
```
after this, the build with all the `gentoo.txt`-mentioned packages started.

Thus, perhaps, installation instructions can have 
commands like `run, as root`:

```
cat $SAGE_ROOT/build/portage/package.keywords >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
```
