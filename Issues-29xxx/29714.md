Logically there is a difference between the replacements

```
-            while ret[-1] != []:
+            while ret[-1]:
```

and

```
-                if arg == []:
+                if not arg:
```

In the latter case a `None` can slip through after the change, in the former it cannot (but it could before). So from a formal point of view, the first replacement is an improvement, the second a regression, and they are clearly distinguished by the apperance of `not`.

However, from an operational viewpoint, it is hard to imagine an unexpected `None` generating a silent error, at least in my experience. So one could adopt a legalistic attitude: whosoever overloads the `bool()` built-in should expect it to be used as in these optimizations.

I have looked again at all of the changes, and remove some slightly dubious ones.

What remains seems safe enough for me.
