In #28488 the code for computing torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields was upgraded and made much more efficient, specifically the function torsion_bound() in `ell_torsion.py`.  That code was tested extensively on a large number of curves, all base-changes of curves defined over QQ, which is (for efficiency) treated as a special case in that function.

I am now running the new code on another large number of curves in the LMFDB and am running into problems which are not easily reproducible, causing run-time errors in lines 408-410 of this file, when the curve is reduced modulo primes.  Typically this only happens after processing hundreds of curves, and when the problematic curve is run by itself it works fine.

I am investigating and will fix this.

Also using this ticket for more serious problems in saturation code.

I think the issue is that some (but not all) of the discrete log variants have a parameter bounds which is a tuple (lb,ub) and the functions are inconsistent as to whether the range of log values is intended to be lb<=v<ub or lb<=v<=ub.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Not yet quite ready for review but the branch is here already.

Changes in saturation code: much refactoring in saturation.py, with both code simplification and also some algorithmic enhancements:

1. Reduction primes Q are degree 1 primes above rational primes q chosen to make the reduction simplest: not ramified and not dividing the index of the equation order (i.e. not dividing the discriminant of the defining polynomial of th base field).   With such q, Q can be found by factoring the defining polynomial and then the reduction of the curve can be defined directly over GF(q) by simply reducing the curve coefficients.  Secondly, q does not divide the denominators of the points being saturated, so that reducing the points is also simpler.

2. Saturation is now carried out within a new class `EllipticCurveSaturator`.  This enables the information about the reduced curves and their cardinality to be re-used when p-saturating for many primes p, which is more efficient, since that information is stored within the class.

3. I noticed a special case taking a long time, namely for curves with rational CM by a discriminant D, p-saturation when kronecker(D,p)=-1 was taking a long time, much longer than when kronecker(D,p)=+1.   This is because the mod-p representation is non-split Cartan which in turn means that the p-torsion is defined over a cyclic extension of degree `p^2-1` and hence the density of Q which are usable is `1/(p^2-1)`.  By only testing q such that q=1 (mod p) this is reduced to 1/(p+1) which is OK.  In th split case the density is 1/(p-1) anyway.  This step helped a lot in saturating curves over QQ(sqrt(D)) for D=-3,-4,-7,-8,-11 which are in the LMFDB.

<a id='comment:7'></a>This is now ready for review.

I have to come clean on one matter.  The (stand-alone) function `p_projections(Eq, points, p)` in saturation.py still sometimes and un-reproducibly raises an error.  The function which calls this one catches that and uses a different reduction prime, so no fatal error is raised and everything works OK.  The error always occurs when p=2 and the 2-primary part of Eq.abelian_group() is not cyclic.  (Here Eq is an elliptic curve over GF(q), oints is a list of points on Eq, and p is a prime.) After multiplying the generators of Eq by the prime-to-p part of the group order one should still have 2 non-trivial generators and then use the part of the code for this case, which uses the Weil pairing.  But occasionally after that multiplication only one non-trivial generator remains, the code for the cyclic case runs, and fails when any of the points in the supplied list is not a multiple of the only generator.  I have so far been unable to find any example of this which is reproducible, and I was careful (I think) to clear caches.  But I want to move on.

Apat from this one issue (which has been there ever since this code was first written) the other changes made on this ticket are all worth having as they simplify and speed up saturation.  I have run this on several hundred thousand curves.  For example, i one run which is ongoing, after saturating 28656 curves over several quartic fields, I have seen the issue 5 times.

For the record, here is one example (https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/4.4.18496.1/36.4/i/2)

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 - 2*x^3 - 11*x^2 + 12*x + 2)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 2/9*a^3 - 1/3*a^2 - 19/9*a + 10/9, -1/9*a^3 + 2/3*a^2 + 14/9*a - 23/9, -2*a^3 - 5*a^2 + 4*a + 3, -89/9*a^3 - 56/3*a^2 + 301/9*a + 32/9])
sage: points = [E([-5/9*a^3 + 1/3*a^2 + 52/9*a + 2/9 , 10/9*a^3 - 5/3*a^2 - 131/9*a - 4/9 ])]
```
where the output with debug=True was once

```
In p_projections(G,Plist,p) with G = Additive abelian group isomorphic to Z/24 + Z/2 embedded in Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + 37*y = x^3 + 7*x^2 + 12*x + 38 over Finite Field of size 47, Plist = [(25 : 30 : 1), (35 : 11 : 1)], p = 2
m=3, n=48
gens for 2-primary part of G: [(14 : 38 : 1)]
3*points: [(0 : 9 : 1), (35 : 11 : 1)]
Cyclic case, taking dlogs to base (14 : 38 : 1) of order 8
```
Here the group structure is 24*2 so multiplying by 3 maps to the 2-primary part with structure 8*2, however multiplying the gens by 3 and then dropping any which are 0 here results in a list of length 1 not 2.

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.saturation import EllipticCurveSaturator
sage: saturator = EllipticCurveSaturator(E, verbose=True)
sage: saturator.full_p_saturation(points, p=2)
 --starting full 2-saturation
Adding 1 torsion generators before 2-saturation
Using sieve method to saturate...
E has 2-torsion over Finite Field of size 47, projecting points
 --> [(13 : 1 : 1), (33 : 43 : 1)]
 --rank is now 1
 --rank is now 2
Reached full rank: points were 2-saturated
Removing the torsion generators after 2-saturation
Points were 2-saturated
([(-5/9*a^3 + 1/3*a^2 + 52/9*a + 2/9 : 10/9*a^3 - 5/3*a^2 - 131/9*a - 4/9 : 1)],
 0)
```

The underlying reason for the lack of reproducibility is that Eq.abelian_group() uses random points.  I did some testing with all possible pairs of generators but had no luck.  So I am wondering if some code somewhere is overwriting the cached gens.
