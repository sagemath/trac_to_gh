sage_setup will be used by the build system of various distribution packages (#29705).

So we make it a regular distribution package itself, with sources in `pkgs/sage-setup/` (#31577) and install it with `pip`.

The actual Python source files are not moved because `sage_setup` takes part in Sage doctesting (see #31577).

`sagelib`'s `setup.py` will no longer install `sage_setup`.

`sage-setup` will become a `build-system requires` of `sagemath-standard` (declared in `pyproject.toml`)

Follow-up: 
- #29924: Do not fail if `sage.env`, `sage.*` are not available

+sage_setup will be used by the build system of various distribution packages (#29705).
+
+So we make it a regular distribution package itself, with sources in \`pkgs/sage-setup/\` (#31577) and install it with \`pip\`.
+
+The actual Python source files are not moved because \`sage_setup\` takes part in Sage doctesting (see #31577).
