We add a few constructions of difference matrices whose lambda parameter is not 1.

We then modify the orthogonal arrays and transversal designs constructions
to take advantage of these additions. Finally, we add a new function `symmetric_net`.

One occurrence of "more than 1 time" should be "more than once" as elsewhere.

Can you do a round of pep8 formatting?

I would use `lamda` as an alternate name for lambda
(since lambda is a reserved keyword in Python).
I find it makes code easier to read than lambd or lmbda.

I did some more work on the "subgroup_construction" method and added support for GAP groups in other places.
Sage's tests pass and the documentation builds without errors. However, I've probably missed some formatting issues here and there.

`lmbda` is the keyword used throughout the "designs_pyx.pyx" and the "difference_matrices.py" files. I introduced it only in the "orthogonal_arrays.py" file. If it bothers you, then I'll change it in all three files as I believe it should be consistent across them.

Finally, the definition of difference matrices in the doctoring doesn't seem right and needs some checking.

I looked into the definition of difference matrices.\\
The book "Design Theory" by Beth et. al. (Cambridge University Press, 1999) defines a `(g, k, \lambda)` difference matrix as a `k \times \lambda g` matrix such that for any two distinct rows `R_i, R_j` each element of `G` appears `\lambda` times in the sequence `(R_i[l]-R_j[l])`. This is basically, the definition given in the docstring, but the dimensions of the matrix are flipped (hence the docstring is wrong).\\
The docstring in `is_difference_matrix`, gives the same definition without specifying the dimensions.
What the codes actually do is redirecting the call to `is_quasi_difference_matrix` which, in this specific case, checks that in any 2  `__columns__` `C_i, C_j` each element of `G` appears `\lambda` times in the sequence `(C_i[l] - C_j[l])`. However we need `G` to be Abelian since the code doesn't check both `C_i - C_j` and `C_j - C_i`.

So there are 2 issues to fix:
1. change the docstring of difference matrices to use columns or change the code by taking transposes when needed;
2. limit difference matrices to Abelian groups or change the `is_quasi_difference_matrix` function to allow for non-Abelian groups

Personally, I would change the docstring for the difference matrices so that it matches the definition of quasi-difference matrices and then change the code of `is_quasi_difference_matrix` to allow for non-Abelian groups. Are there any reasons I should not go this way?

I think changing the docstring is the obvious best option - as it does not break any code.

In the non-abelian case, do you still use additive notation for the group? This is unusual,
perhaps needs commenting...

While there exist non-abelian difference sets (e.g. http://mathonline.wikidot.com/difference-sets-in-non-abelian-groups), the `difference_family` function explicitly states that it only returns difference families for abelian groups.

As far as the notation is concerned, it seems standard to use `+` and `-` for difference matrices despite I haven't found any definition that restricts to abelian groups. If we end up allowing non-abelian groups, then I'll add a note in the docstrings.
