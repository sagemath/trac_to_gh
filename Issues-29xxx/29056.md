For numpy to find Homebrew's openblas on macOS, this ticket adds an `[openblas]` section to numpy's site.cfg if Sage is using openblas. This is also what Homebrew's [numpy formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/f2463cbba086689c872cddd3a8bc242976a603ff/Formula/numpy.rb#L25-L30) does. See also the upstream [site.cfg.example](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/2199ba7fb7f8bb383552fdcd6feec4faee7ae394/site.cfg.example#L129-L132).

Before this ticket, numpy would use the macOS Accelerate framework instead of openblas, as can be seen from the logs:

```
  FOUND:
    extra_compile_args = ['-msse3', '-I/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers']
    extra_link_args = ['-Wl,-framework', '-Wl,Accelerate']
    define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 3), ('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]
```

After:

```
  FOUND:
    libraries = ['openblas', 'openblas']
    library_dirs = ['/usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.7/lib']
    language = c
    define_macros = [('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]
```

This problem was previously discussed on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/91e0GfHT-Yo).

<a id='comment:1'></a>In order to test this, one currently needs to force-link Homebrew's readline to `/usr/local` (#29000) and configure Sage with

```
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
```
as openblas is keg-only.

Is pkg-config not always present, possibly by installing the pkgconf spkg? In any case, I changed the relevant line to account for the possibility of an empty dictionary:

```diff
-    if 'openblas' in pc_blas['libraries']:
+    if 'openblas' in pc_blas.get('libraries', []):
```

I have tested this on 9.1.beta1 both using openblas from Homebrew and from Sage and in each case both numpy and scipy find the correct openblas.

You mean by removing the Darwin if-case? I tried that first, but for some reason it did not work, possibly because Numpy has the [preference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/building.html#blas): OpenBLAS > Accelerate > BLAS/LAPACK.

This preference can be changed using the variables `NPY_BLAS_ORDER`/`NPY_LAPACK_ORDER`, but setting these in Numpy's `spkg-install` did not seem to help either.
