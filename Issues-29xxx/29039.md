```
As #30913 makes **sage-conf** both (a) a PEP517/518 `build_system` `requires` and (b) an `install-requires` of sagelib (`sagemath-standard`), also a version of **sage-conf** must be made available on PyPI.

This version of **sage-conf** includes a copy of `SAGE_ROOT` and `SAGE_ROOT/build/**` in its source distribution. On installation (or wheel building) it establishes a python-less SAGE_LOCAL hierarchy (#31362) in `~/.sage/` by running `configure` and `make build-local`; and then installs the configured `sage_conf.py` (#29038) as a Python module (and `sage-config`, `sage-env-config`). 

There are no changes to how the Sage distribution is built. This ticket only provides an alternative and strictly optional way of installing (the non-Python bits of) Sage-the-distribution.  It may be useful for some users who wish to use `pip` to install everything they need. 

To test:

```
./bootstrap && (cd pkgs/sage-conf_pypi/ && tox -r -v -v -v)
```
This test using `tox` uses `.sage` in an isolated directory within `.tox` instead of in your home directory. At the end of the tox run, the installed `sage-config` script is executed; it prints the configuration variables:

```

python finish: run-test  after 0.17 seconds
```

To build a source distribution:

```
./sage -sh -c build/pkgs/sage_conf/spkg-src
```
(The source distribution has been uploaded to https://pypi.org/project/sage-conf/)

Follow-up steps:
- Make SAGE_ROOT configurable by the user (by passing `--prefix` to `setup.py`).
- Optionally, it would create a venv that is used for building wheels. 
- #30036: Make the build more incremental: On installation of **sage-conf**,  only run `configure` but do not install anything; rather, a Python entry point can be used by Python distribution packages such as **sagemath-standard** to install packages if present.

OK, so I guess here is the test showing that `pkgconfig` module is not there
(I `cd` to the said `SAGE_ROOT` and run `./local/bin/python3` there):

```

This sounds more like an infinite "make" recursion. Could you remove the setting of `-j` from `src/pkgs/sage_conf-pypi/setup.py` (and from your environment) and try what it does then?

At this point I can just start `tox -r -v -v -v` again, and it happily continues.
Not sure whether the final result is correct. 

Anyway, the error isn't good.
Looks like a bit of an error in a make rule, it tries to make `../pkgs/sage_conf/src/bin/sage-env-config`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Better now... but would be better with deferred configure exits (#32060).

```
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG python3...
  checking whether any of bzip2 xz libffi is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... yes; install python3 as well
  configure: error: given --with-system-python3=force but no system package could be used
  configure failed; this may be caused by missing build prerequisites.
  You can install the required build prerequisites using the following shell command

  sudo apt-get install  binutils make m4 perl python3 tar bc gcc g++ ca-certificates
