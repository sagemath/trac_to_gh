The goal of this ticket is to implement basic dynamical system functionality on Berkovich space over `Cp`. The immediate goal is to be able to compute the image of points. Type I points can be computed with the existing functionality in Sage. Type II, III and IV points will require additional functionality, to be implemented in this ticket.

This ticket relies heavily on the implementation of Berkovich space in #29844.

I'm still waiting for compilation to finish, but here is some comments from a code review. Nothing really major here.


need to include latest 29844

do you really needs the ._polys data as this is already contained in ._system._polys?



14: date needed

58: should give the class dynamical system

60: p-adic

95: affine dynamical system

98: z^2 + 1

129: extra words

172: You seem to be trapping the error in creating the dynamical system, which would give information about what failed in trying to create the dynamical system. It seems like that information would be helpful rather than the more generic error you display

175: What if you have a dynamical system defined on a subscheme?

_eq_, _neq_: you have no tests that check that two systems are unequal

256: ending .

274: need ' - '

319: shouldn't this be relative dimension? Although I'd be inclined to just say 'dimension' as the base will be a field anyway.

318: class of dynamical system

348: trailing whitespace

370: The error is really that you cannot convert not that you know it is affine. Again you masking the more specific initialization error. I can somewhat see why that might be desirable here.

374: the should be projective not affine

375: dimension_absolute. So this will fail for the base being say ZZ

379: p-adic

405: Perhaps name this as_projective_dynamical_system. There is no a cooresponding function for affine. Looking at the documentation, it seems like this function is meant to be in the class:DynamicalSystem_Berkovich. In which case the name is fine.

455: What is you scale by p?

473: extra line

505,512,536,538: ending .

524: , adjugate


The _call_ documentation isn't visible to the user, so these description need to be moved. Perhaps to the class documentation.

650: isn't that error that the point is not in the domain? again, why is the error message from the coercion not better?

652: backed

654: are defined

667: some spaces for readability

719: space - space

798: this input seems more descriptive than for the other classes

849: Wouldn't homogenization be faster that calling the constructor. Also, what if you get something other than affine/projective?

847: dimensional absolute again

874: projective Berkovich space?

898: , space

918: same as before

need blank line at the end

<a id='comment:12'></a>A couple more things:

- 808+. An action is defined for matrices and dynamical systems: F = F*M

- for 808-816. Why don't you do

dehomogenize_hom = list((F*M).dehomogenize(1))

I didn't try it, but doesn't that do the same thing?

- 813: R.gen(0) also works

- 872 #add comment that this is the start of Type III


- Seems like this should work, since the equivalent call works for projective

```
sage: Q.<z> = QQ[]
sage: A.<a> = NumberField(z^3 + 20)
sage: ideal = A.prime_above(3)
sage: P.<z> = AffineSpace(A, 1)
sage: B = Berkovich_Cp_Affine(A, ideal)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_Berkovich([z^2], domain=B)
```

- This is what I mean by the subscheme examples

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
X=P.subscheme([x-y])
f=DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2,y^2],domain=X)
DynamicalSystem_Berkovich(f)
```

Your error message does not make any sense for this one.


- I also ran a few of Benedetto's image examples from his exercises and got all correct answers.

Changed the error message slightly. The key point I'm trying to get across is the is_ProjectiveSpace() must return True when called on the domain.

Replying to [bhutz](#comment%3A11):

Deleted the ._polys data, switched to dimension relative. As for the error messages in the try catch blocks, in the notebook all the error messages are displayed, so the failed conversion error messages are still shown.
