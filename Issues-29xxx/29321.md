The code hangs if the value `0` is encountered at any point in the iteration, because the termination condition is based on relative difference, rather than absolute difference. This happens when calculating `AGM(a,0)` and `AGM(a,-a)`, so the code treats these as special cases.  The bug reported in this ticket is that the test for `a == -b` was faulty when either `real(a)` or `imag(a)` is `0`. I fixed this.

The value `0` will also be encountered (and the original code will hang) when using the "principal" algorithm to calculate `AGM(a,a)`, if `a` is in the left half-plane. Unfortunately, rounding errors make it difficult to predict in advance whether iterates near the imaginary axis will be in the left half-plane or not, so it is not clear (to me, at least) whether this situation will arise at some point in the iteration. Therefore, I revised the termination condition to check for the presence of `0` when the algorithm is "principal".

An easy analysis shows that no other situations can encounter `0`, so these fixes should eliminate the hanging problem.

I also refactored, added doctests, and revised the documentation (including moving the "optimal" algorithm to be first, since it is the default).

I need to fix two issues.
1. The original code was careful to employ `mpfr` for all floating-point calculations, so I think I should eliminate my use of `-self` in the test for `AGM(a,-a)`.
2. My termination condition for the "principal" algorithm is very poor. The program should be allowed to run until it actually hits 0 (or converges), not just when it gets near 0. I think this means that, in exceptional circumstances, the "principal" algorithm cannot be guaranteed to converge, because it conceivably could hit an infinite sequence of values that converge to 0.
