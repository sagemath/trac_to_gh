I tried to use ECL and Maxima from system packages as suggested by #27330, but without success for the moment.

The `spkg-configure.m4` are trivial (see attachments), but the problems occur during build:

In [dochtml] [manifolds] this error is produced:

```
RuntimeError: ECL says: The function SET-LOCALE-SUBDIR is undefined
```

Actually this error is reproducible out of the Sage's build mechanism:

```
$ ecl
> (require 'maxima)
> (in-package :maxima)
MAXIMA> (set-locale-subdir)
Condition of type: UNDEFINED-FUNCTION
The function MAXIMA::SET-LOCALE-SUBDIR is undefined.
```

According to Maxima's code, `set-locale-subdir` is defined in `src/init-cl.lisp` and:

```
    ;; If a file is declared as private-file it is loaded
    ;; from the build tree (which makes an out-of-tree
    ;; build possible), but not compiled (which means
    ;; that with ECL or ABCL it won't end up in the final image)
    ;; => no out-of-tree build for ECL.
```

Maybe someone with Lisp-fu could patch it, if possible?

Note: I also tried to use only ECL from the system packages, and build maxima from Sage, but in this case Maxima fails

- with the default ECLDIR in sage-env the cmp lisp files are not found:

```
ecl -norc -eval '(progn (load "../lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp") (load "../lisp-utils/make-depends.lisp") (funcall (intern "CREATE-DEPENDENCY-FILE" :mk) "binary-ecl/maxima" "ecl-depends.mk") (quit))'
;;; Loading "/usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage/usr/local/var/tmp/sage/build/maxima-5.42.2/src/src/../lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp"
An error occurred during initialization:
Filesystem error with pathname #P"SYS:CMP.NEWEST".
```

- when ECLDIR is patched to the right value, that works, but it fails when it tries to install the maxima library under this directory (unless you are root!).

OK, in FreeBSD the ECL system package is at 16.1.3!

I did not know that it was incompatible with sage, maybe this is the source of the problem, thanks.

This rejects ecl-16.1.3 and accepts ecl-21.2.1 on Gentoo. I'm still waiting on the build to finish to see if it works, though.

That's from the missing patch. When stderr is /dev/full, ecl used to go into an infinite loop. That particular problem is fixed, but the test in question actually goes a bit further and checks what happens if both stdout and stderr are full. In short: it segfaults. I reported this upstream a few hours ago not realizing we had a test for it: https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/634

I'd rather not add 139 (segault) to the list of allowed return codes there... so maybe we should make the ECL test weaker for the time being? The patch that sage carries is no longer being considered upstream anywhere.

What's the correct way to substitute a `$SAGE_LOCAL` path into `sage_conf.py.in` at build time? The "substitute ecl-config path into sage_conf" commit is currently broken with the SPKG because I don't know what to put in there. It works with the system copy though.

I ran into the same problem with `MAXIMA_FAS`, which should default to the `SAGE_LOCAL` path where the Maxima SPKG installs it.

I've worked around this in the latest commit but it's pretty ugly. I made the SPKG location the default again, undoing part of #26100. That works because `SAGE_LOCAL` is available in `env.py`.

But there are two other things you might want to set `MAXIMA_FAS` to: an unusual but correct path, and "no path." Setting it to the correct path is easy, but now "no path" is achieved by setting `MAXIMA_FAS = <junk>` in sage_conf, and counting on the fallback in `maxima_lib.py`.

I'm certainly open to other ideas. If we decide to keep the workaround, `@`arojas in particular should make sure I didn't mess anything up too badly for distro packages.

This passes tests with my system ECL and SPKG maxima on Gentoo.

Hi,
 Looks good as far as the Arch distro package is concerned. `ecl_eval("(require 'maxima \"{}\")".format(MAXIMA_FAS))` fails because the ecl modules are in the default upstream path `/usr/lib/ecl-${version}`, but then `ecl_eval("(require 'maxima)")` succeeds.

I would think (hope) that the current solution is more complicated than needed.

Distributions are able to install maxima in a way that a simple `(REQUIRE :MAXIMA)` works in ecl.
(Note that this is not just a search for a `maxima.fasl` but rather goes through `EXT:*MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS*` into which system definition facilities such as MK:DEFSYSTEM or ASDF hook.)

If the Sage distribution has to install maxima, then we install the FASL in a custom directory and set the variable `MAXIMA_FAS` to the correct value in `sage_conf`. No defaults should be set in `env.py`.

Instead of the `try`/`except` in `maxima_lib.py`, just dispatch on empty/nonempty value of `MAXIMA_FAS`.

This was the first thing I tried, but I ran into the same problem as in[comment:34](#comment%3A34). With no (?) way to substitute `$SAGE_LOCAL` at `./configure`-time, I made the `$SAGE_LOCAL` location the default at runtime instead. That way you can effectively point `MAXIMA_FAS` at `SAGE_LOCAL` by leaving it undefined.

Pretty much all of the extra complexity comes from that. If there's a way to get `$SAGE_LOCAL` into `MAXIMA_FAS` at `./configure`-time, I can make this branch a lot simpler.

So this fixes a regression for the `kenzo` package introduced by the ECL update?

It would be good to update the ticket description.

Kenzo is optional so I wouldn't guess as to when it stopped working. Some of its tests fail; for example, `sage/interfaces/kenzo.py` has

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: m24 = MooreSpace(2,4)                          # optional - kenzo

but when I run it I get

We do run CI tests on GH Actions for all optional packages (just the installation + spkg-check). See for example https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/2223044706 for 9.3.rc1. I do not see any build failures for kenzo. Were just some tests of the sagelib testsuite failing when kenzo is installed (the GH Actions do not test this), or what is the issue?

Digging deeper, I probably just broke kenzo with the ECL spkg.

Our ECL spkg bundles ASDF, and the bundled version works OK. But if the system copy of ECL is used and if that system copy does **not** bundle ASDF, then there's a backwards-incompatible API change in the ASDF `make-build` function which has been deprecated for a while (and now exists only for the sake of backwards-compatibility with ECL).

Ultimately the `make-build` function takes a `type` argument (was `:fasl` but I changed it to `:fasb`) and passes it to another function called `select-bundle-operation`. In the bundled copy of ASDF, it looks like

```cl
  ;; Find the operation that produces a given bundle-type                                                                                                                    
  (defun select-bundle-operation (type &optional monolithic)
    (ecase type
      ((:dll :shared-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-dll-op 'dll-op))
      ((:lib :static-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-lib-op 'lib-op))
      ((:fasl)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-compile-bundle-op 'compile-bundle-op))
      ((:image)
       'image-op)
      ((:program)
       'program-op)))
```

but in my unbundled ASDF, it's

```cl
  ;; Find the operation that produces a given bundle-type                                                                                                                    
  (defun select-bundle-operation (type &optional monolithic)
    (ecase type
      ((:dll :shared-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-dll-op 'dll-op))
      ((:lib :static-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-lib-op 'lib-op))
      ((:fasb)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-compile-bundle-op 'compile-bundle-op))
      ((:image)
       'image-op)
      ((:program)
       'program-op))))
```

To avoid having to support both, one idea that comes to mind is that we could take a newer version of `asdf.lisp` and copy it over the bundled version in the ECL spkg. Then `:fasb` would work in both of the situations above. However it would still fail if the system ECL is using a bundled `asdf.lisp`. Patching kenzo's `compile.lisp` to try both is likely the only reliable way.

As we currently do not have plans to ship additional Common Lisp libraries in the Sage distribution, I think we should not do unbundling work on ECL but stick with upstream.

It would probably also be good to add a `kenzo/spkg-check.in` that at least tries to load it into ECL.

Paging `@`mmcarco :o

* The original kenzo upstream is at https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/
* Our SPKG points to https://github.com/gheber/kenzo
* The release itself comes from https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo/

The ASDF docs say that `program-op` and `program-system` should replace `make-build`. Those functions are available in the bundled copy of ASDF as well, so another good long-term option would be for kenzo upstream to switch to them (if possible).

To clarify this:

What we maintain (by "we" I mean Ana Romeno, Julian Cuevas, Jose Divason and myself) is a small fork of Kenzo, modified to be compatible with ECL, easier to install, and some extra features to allow a better interface with Sage.

I am not fluent in lisp myself, but will talk about this issues with the rest of the team. Maybe we can modify the package to make it more installation friendly.

I have done some tests on that. Might release a new version with this change in a few days, after some testing.

So, to make sure: can you confirm that changing from 


```
(asdf:make-build :kenzo :type :fasl :monolithic t :move-here #P".")
```

to 

```
(asdf:operate 'asdf:monolithic-compile-bundle-op :kenzo)
```

in the `compile.lisp` file would solve the problem?

It fixes the build for my system ECL (with ASDF unbundled). If it also works with sage's ECL spkg, I think we have a solution. Thanks!

The kenzo upgrade is now included, and my previous broken spkg-install hack removed. Everything still works with system ECL.

Github has helpfully disabled actions on my account after the last run, and I'm waiting to hear back from support. Can someone else kick off a CI run please?

One of the bunch of tickets was broken; the failures that you see in the run are from that.

A new run is at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/733869032: 

Correctly accepts system ecl on `homebrew-macos-11.0-xcode_default-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2308094353) and has clean doctests

Correctly accepts system ecl on `gentoo-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2308093679). The build completes. The numerous doctest failures are from the unrelated unfortunate situation described in #31578

Correctly accepts system ecl on `fedora-34-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2308093524), but the build fails for unrelated reasons

Correctly rejects too old system ecl on other platforms.


Build of `kenzo` was tested in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/732049334, looks OK.
