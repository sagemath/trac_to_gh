This branch can be merged by people who are working with tickets pre-9.1.beta2 who cannot easily merge current develop into that ticket.

It turns an error issued by `configure` when they are stray files in `build/pkgs` (such as the generated files introduced in #29038).

Before this ticket:

```
$ mkdir -p build/pkgs/xyzzy/foo
$ ./bootstrap && ./configure
...
configure: error: "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/build/pkgs/xyzzy/type" is missing.
```

After this ticket:

```
...
configure: WARNING: "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/build/pkgs/xyzzy/type" is missing.  Leftovers from another branch?
...
```
