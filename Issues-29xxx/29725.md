<a id='comment:4'></a>The patchbot is saying I should use 'git prune'. However I am reluctant to do this as I don't
understand what I am doing. Could you please tell me how to resolve this?

These seem to be the key lines from the log file.

warning: The last gc run reported the following. Please correct the root cause
and remove .git/gc.log.
Automatic cleanup will not be performed until the file is removed.

warning: There are too many unreachable loose objects; run 'git prune' to remove them.

I suspect that the cause of the problem is that I started with a local branch from my
local path_tableaux so when I pushed to trac the changes to path_tableaux appear twice.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Single quotes `'` are not backticks ```, so you need to change those in a number of places in the documentation.

References should go in the master reference file.

Your module-level documentation with the examples is better in the class-level for `FriezePattern`.

The first "one-line" documentation should only be one sentence. After that there should be a blank line between the next set of documentation (see, e.g., `local_rule`).

A better test for `None` is to explicitly compare `width() is None`.

Why do you need to create the transient lists `v` in `is_integral`? Wouldn't a better test be to check that every entry is in `ZZ`?

In `triangulation()`, it would be good to include a picture of the plot in the doc (see `.. PLOT::` in, e.g., `fully_packed_loop.py`).

The result of `show()` should not return an object. I think you are better off calling that method  `plot()` instead.

```diff
-This constructs the examples from [TJ18]_
+This constructs the examples from [TJ18]_::
```

You should run a `TestSuite(P).run()` on the parent class `P` of `FriezePatterns`.
