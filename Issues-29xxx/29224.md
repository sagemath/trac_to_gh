We add a method to `Polyhedron_base` and `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, which wraps `flag_f_polynomial` of `FiniteLatticePoset` so that `flag_f_vector(1,3)` returns the f_{1,3}.

<a id='comment:2'></a>A few things:

- In the documentation, `(number of faces of each dimension)` should not say the same as the f-vector but say what the flag f-vector counts.
- Remove the backticks and add dash (in combinatorial polyhedron too):

```diff
-        Return the `flag_f_vector`.
+        Return the flag f-vector.
```

```diff
-        For each `-1 < i_0 < \dots < i_n < d` the `flag_f_vector`
+        For each `-1 < i_0 < \dots < i_n < d` the flag f-vector
```

- Backticks missing here (in combinatorial polyhedron file too):

```diff
-        counts the number of flags `F_0 \subset \dots \subset F_n
+        counts the number of flags `F_0 \subset \dots \subset F_n`
```

- Spelling (in combinatorial polyhedron too):

```diff
-        - a dictionary, if no arguments where given
-
-        - an Integer, if arguments where given
+        - a dictionary, if no arguments were given
+
+        - an Integer, if arguments were given
```
