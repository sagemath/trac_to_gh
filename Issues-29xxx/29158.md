```
This slightly odd ticket is needed for the Windows version of Sage, and might be useful in other binary distributions (e.g. Docker?) in which the `src/build` directory has been stripped out.

At issue here is the fact that, if you install an optional package with `sage -i`, after the optional package is installed it runs:

```
touch "$SAGE_ROOT/configure" && $MAKE all-build
```

If `src/build` has been stripped out, this means that *all* of sagelib gets rebuilt, even if it isn't necessary.

This solution is not perfect, however, because sagelib does have some "optional extensions", such that when installing certain optional packages it is necessary to rebuild at least part of sagelib.

So I'm open to better ideas on this, but I do need it right now for the Windows distribution.

Depends on #33131
