`TARGETS_OPTIONAL` is designed for additional tests of things that are likely to fail - such as `ptest` in `tox.yml`, which always has 1 or 2 failures that we don't want to be signaled by a red status.

There's only a rather shallow reason why currently use `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` for testing the optional and experimental packages. At the moment the majority of the optional and experimental packages fail, so all of these test runs will fail. Thus there is no information either way. But the green checkmarks look more friendly. 

We can change this when we have made some progress in #29900 (Meta-ticket: Fix optional and experimental packages for Sage 9.2).

Look at the "This run" tab of the whole workflow and search for package names that you're interested in.

From my point of view, optional should mean almost as safe as sage itself and experimental is for all stuff that might or might not work (I guess there are runtime failures as well that make stuff experimental). So adding a doctesting framework for this seems great.
