`TARGETS_OPTIONAL` is designed for additional tests of things that are likely to fail - such as `ptest` in `tox.yml`, which always has 1 or 2 failures that we don't want to be signaled by a red status.

There's only a rather shallow reason why currently use `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` for testing the optional and experimental packages. At the moment the majority of the optional and experimental packages fail, so all of these test runs will fail. Thus there is no information either way. But the green checkmarks look more friendly. 

We can change this when we have made some progress in #29900 (Meta-ticket: Fix optional and experimental packages for Sage 9.2).
