I also drop the "Maintained" badge. It appeared to be a good idea at the time but due to a bug in docker hub, we cannot update the README automatically, so it says unmaintained every year until we notice.

Suggested rephrasing for the comment about `-py3`:

```
* `-py3` - until Sage 9.1, we provided Python 2 builds (with no suffix)
   and Python 3 builds (with the `-py3` suffix). From Sage 9.2.beta0 on,
   we only provide Python 3 based images and the `-py3` suffix survives
   only for historic reasons: with or without it, you get Python 3.

Should "for historic reasons" read "for historical reasons"?

Getting rid of the non-working "maintained" badge makes sense.

I think so.
