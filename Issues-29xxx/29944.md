I also drop the "Maintained" badge. It appeared to be a good idea at the time but due to a bug in docker hub, we cannot update the README automatically, so it says unmaintained every year until we notice.

Suggested rephrasing for the comment about `-py3`:

```

Getting rid of the non-working "maintained" badge makes sense.
