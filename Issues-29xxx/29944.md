I also drop the "Maintained" badge. It appeared to be a good idea at the time but due to a bug in docker hub, we cannot update the README automatically, so it says unmaintained every year until we notice.

Suggested rephrasing for the comment about `-py3`:

```
* `-py3` - until Sage 9.1, we provided Python 2 builds (with no suffix)

Should "for historic reasons" read "for historical reasons"?

Getting rid of the non-working "maintained" badge makes sense.
