This meta-ticket reviews development tools that are provided by `sagelib` or by Sage command-line scripts  as part of in Sage:
- Check whether they still work correctly
- Check whether equivalent tools are provided by mainstream Python tools (in particular IPython / Jupyter); add findings/recommendations to the documentation
- Find related existing Trac tickets
- What should be removed; what should be contributed to existing mainstream Python packages; what should be split out as separate Python packages.

Development tools:
* `search_src` (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/Q61rOkZ303M/onJdv_-lAQAJ)
* scripts in `src/bin/`
* options of `src/bin/sage`
* `explain_pickle` (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/94kP0_Xbx04/x7St89zwCgAJ)
*  `import_statements` (in `sage.misc.dev_tools`)
