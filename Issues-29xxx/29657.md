The goal of this ticket is to organize and follow the changes and improvements done on methods for computing distances, diameter, radius and eccentricities.

**Tickets**:
- #29660: Move radius, diameter and eccentricity methods from generic_graph.py to graph.py and digraph.py
- #29715: Implement a fast algorithm by Dragan, Habib and Viennot for computing the radius of undirected graphs.
- #29734: fix an error in `shortest_path_lengths` method in `generic_graph.py`. The input graph should not be modified.
- #29744: Implement diameter computation method for undirected graphs given by Dragan, Habib and Viennot.
- #27934: Implement all eccentricity method for undirected graphs given by Dragan, Habib and viennot.
- #29422:  DiFUB algorithm for diameter of real (unweighed) directed graphs
- #30039: Weighted version of difub algorithm and 2Dsweep.
- #30081: Cleaning and improving consistency in `distances` methods in graph module
- #30247: memory efficient implementation of Wiener index
- #30269: memory efficient implementation of distances distribution
- #30405: fast (and memory efficient) implementation of `antipodal_graph`


**To do**:
- avoid the use of "dict of dict of distances" inside method eccentricity, and avoid repeated conversions from one graph format to the other
- Make usage of weights, weight functions and checks consistent. See for instance issue reported with boost in #29781. This can be done by introducing following lines of code in all distances related methods such `shortest_path(s)` , `shortest_path_length(s)`, `shortest_path_all_pairs`

```
if by_weight and weight_function is None:
    def weight_function(e):
        return 1 if e[2] is None else e[2]
```

- `shortest_paths` method in `boost_graph.pyx` doesnt properly detect negative cycle using `Bellman-Ford` as algorithm. To solve, we can try to traverse distance dictionary and check if any value is negative. If negative then raise error, since distances can't be negative.

- In #29744 and #29715, we have raised an error, if graph contains negative edge weights. Reason for this was `Bellman-Ford` is not able to properly detect negative cycle in undirected graphs. 

**Opened and inactive tickets, to be finalized or ...**
- #29346:  diameter for large directed real graphs - Algorithm by [Takuya Akiba, Yoichi Iwata, Yuki Kawata](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20086-6_5)
- #29309: duplicate of #29346 with a different implementation
- #29336: proposal for making a code of Yuki Kawata to compute the diameter of directed graphs an external package. Same algorithm than #29346 ? 
- #27564: methods for computing the diameter of trees. Note that 2 BFS / Dijkstra calls are sufficient for that.
- #27540: approximate algorithm for the diameter of undirected graphs.


- #4854: add parameter `as_edge` to return a path as a list of labeled edges instead of a list of vertices

You are right, some of them must be finalized, some other closed.

For #27564, we may implement a Tree class like `BipartiteGraph` and to add it specific methods. This could help organizing methods.
