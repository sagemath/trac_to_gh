Currently, when iterating over Weil polynomals, initial coefficient constraints are not being handled correctly in some cases:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.weil.weil_polynomials import WeilPolynomials as WP
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: u = x^6 + x^5 + 6*x^4 - 2*x^3 + 66*x^2 + 121*x + 1331
sage: u.is_weil_polynomial()
True
sage: l = list(WP(6, 11, 1, [1,1])); u in l # This is good
True
sage: l = list(WP(6, 11, 1, [1,1,6])); u in l # This is bad
False
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>This turns out to be a trivial bug: when converting from symmetric to asymmetric polynomials in the wrapper, I was missing a power of `q`. This wasn't caught by the previous doctests because the ones with coefficient constraints had `q == 1`. 

Besides the one-line fix, I've added a doctest to certify it. I also patched up a couple of formatting issues in the docstring for `WeilPolynomials`.
