We implement a method of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` that obtains the polar/dual. We name it `dual` and create an alias `polar` to be consistent with `Polyhedron_base`.

This is obtained by simply copying and interchanging the bitrepresentation of facets and vertices. The object is purely combinatorial and does not have vertex or facet names. A `ValueError` is raised for the unbounded case.

Along the way we implement a `__copy__` method for `ListOfFaces` and allow initializing `CombinatorialPolyhedron` from a tuple consisting of two `ListOfFaces`.

* Maybe add #28608 as a dependency here and change the code accordingly.
* In the documentation of `CombinatorialPolyhedron`. add to `far_face` the option when `data` is a tuple  consisting of facets and vertices (of class ListOfFaces).
* A typo:
