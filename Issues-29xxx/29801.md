Add a class `FormalPolyhedraModule` for formal modules generated by polyhedra, graded by dimension, and a category `PolyhedraModules`.

So far everything is finitely generated. This will be changed in follow-up tickets.

This is the default prefix for a submodule, so if you want a different prefix, you will need to override it with something like

```python
def submodule(self, gens, check=True, already_echelonized=False,
              unitriangular=False, category=None):
    if not already_echelonized:
        gens = self.echelon_form(gens, unitriangular)
    from sage.modules.with_basis.subquotient import SubmoduleWithBasis
        return SubmoduleWithBasis(gens, ambient=self, prefix='M',
                                  unitriangular=unitriangular,
                                  category=category)
```
However, you can set/change this dynamically at any point with:

```
sage: M_lower.print_options(prefix='V')
sage: y
V[0]
```
Although there probably should be an option added to the `submodule` to pass along such information to the submodule's constructor...

So can you explain a bit why we should have this category?

If you do keep the category, `super_categories` needs a doctest.

Your `INPUT:` block should follow this format:

```
INPUT:

- ``foo`` -- some information
- ``bar`` -- other information that is
  really long
```
Note the alignment (you have an additional 1 space indentation) and the double `--` for the non-bullet point.

`FormalPolyhedraModule.__init__` needs a doctest; here we usually do a `TestSuite(M).run()` as the test.

Sorry, that wasn't meant to be a suggestion to remove it; it was purely a question as I don't know what your long term structural plans are. Although I do think purely local to this ticket it is better.

Your `__init__` still needs a doctest, something like

```python
            sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.modules.formal_polyhedra_module import FormalPolyhedraModule
            sage: def closed_interval(a,b): return Polyhedron(vertices=[[a], [b]])
            sage: I01 = closed_interval(0, 1); I01.rename("conv([0], [1])")
            sage: I11 = closed_interval(1, 1); I11.rename("{[1]}")
            sage: I12 = closed_interval(1, 2); I12.rename("conv([1], [2])")
            sage: I02 = closed_interval(0, 2); I02.rename("conv([0], [2])")
            sage: M = FormalPolyhedraModule(QQ, 1, basis=[I01, I11, I12, I02])
            sage: TestSuite(M).run()
```

To help avoid some confusion in `degree_on_basis`, I think it would be a bit better to say `this would only be a filtration,` since this module does not (yet) have the linear relations implemented and it is in the category of graded modules.

Indeed, such a linter would be nice.
