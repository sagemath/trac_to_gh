The function `lift_to_sl2z(c, d, N)` returns larger coefficients than needed in the cases `c = 0` or `d = 0`.  Also, the (trivial) case `N = 1` is not treated correctly.

Before:

```
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 41, 42)
[-1, -2, 42, 83]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 5, 42)
[17, 19, 42, 47]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(5, 0, 42)
[-2, -101, 5, 252]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 0, 1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: Element (0, 0) not in P1.
```
After:

```
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 41, 42)
[-1, 0, 0, -1]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 5, 42)
[17, 2, 42, 5]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(5, 0, 42)
[-2, -17, 5, 42]
sage: lift_to_sl2z(0, 0, 1)
[1, 0, 0, 1]
```
