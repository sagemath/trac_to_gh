Apparently mac app installation instructions need updating (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/KuZXlKFHofI/WBlq9_yhAgAJ)

This should be done in:
- the installation manual: `src/doc/en/installation/` 
- `src/mac-app/sage-README-macOS.txt` (see #25995)

There is also http://files.sagemath.org/osx/README.txt, which appears to be outdated, 
and https://github.com/sagemath/website/blob/master/src/download-mac.html

Version-specific troubleshooting instructions for already-released versions such as 9.0 can be added instead to https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.0

Previous tickets:
- #29371 little tweak in mac-app


Depends on #30867

> Yeah, that is probably something much harder to fix than this ticket doc upgrades.  What would even be involved in making an "official" Mac app?  Surely more overhead than Sage developers have to offer.

First things first, we should ship the commandline Sage installable into /Applications, see
https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/issues/26
(or, perhaps, investigate the macOS-specific way to build a relocateable terminal application)

with this, it should be possible to build a codesigned app that uses this location.

At the moment, several parts of the Sage app don't work any more, e.g. one cannot launch a terminal session from Sage app, as one gets

```
Running command: /Users/dima/sage/sage
2020-10-23 10:24:16.913842+0100 Sage[27682:2147028] terminalRun: Error running Applescript: {
    NSAppleScriptErrorAppName = "System Events";
    NSAppleScriptErrorBriefMessage = "Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events.";
    NSAppleScriptErrorMessage = "Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events.";
    NSAppleScriptErrorNumber = "-1743";
    NSAppleScriptErrorRange = "NSRange: {86, 10}";
```
yes, I loaded Sage app into XCode 12 to dig this up.

Loading into XCode was not uneventful, there were a number of (legacy) errors, all of them fortunately automatically corrected, and
there was also necessary to modify `PATH` to include  `$SAGE_ROOT`.

I can tell you what happens with our 9.1 app for 10.15.4 on 10.15.7 - it refuses to open, with the message "...cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified".

I guess only a drastic disabling of the security would allow this to run (if this is at all possible, I don't know), as the default options are either to

-  only allow apps from Apple Store, or
- only  allow apps either from the Store or from verified Apple Developers.
