Main changes:
- [https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/](https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/), supports python >= 3.6
- `cygwin.patch` does not apply anymore
- [cffi>=1.13.1](https://pypi.org/project/cffi/) is a new dependency, we install latest 1.14.0 (supports python >= 3.2)
- [pycparser](https://pypi.org/project/pycparser/) is a new dependency (required by cffi, supports python >= 3.4)
- [https://pypi.org/project/tzlocal/](https://pypi.org/project/tzlocal/) is a new dependency, we install latest 2.1 (supports python >= 2.7)
- [https://pypi.org/project/pytz/](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) is a new dependency, we update to latest 2020.1 (supports python >= 2.4)

- add small patches to `setup.py` that
  - disables printing on `stdout` (that perturbs `pip`) - accepted upstream
  - removes the build dependency on `pytest`
- some more dependencies (pytest, numpy, tzlocal) conditional on SAGE_CHECK!=no

tarballs: see `checksums.ini` (to download automatically, use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`)

`pytest` has a lot of dependencies
- `attrs`
- `importlib-metadata`
- `more-itertools`
- `pluggy`
- `py`
- `zipp`
The easiest might be to patch `rpy2` to not depend on `pytest`. I suspect that only the test suite of `rpy2` depends on `pytest`.

My first reaction was: No, no, no, no, no. And no.". A patched version has a very heavy price in terms of maintenance each and every update entails patch checking/upgrading, up to the point the whole mess becomes unmaintainable.

The maintenance price of the added dependencies should be considered, of course, but I suspect that it may be lower than the price of a patch to `rpy2`.

rpy2 should be patched so that pytest is not an actual dependency, but test-only. 

rpy2 is missing modern metadata such as requirements.txt, test-requirements.txt, tox.ini where things like this are commonly declared.


#28998 would install pytest only when SAGE_CHECK=yes.

On Debian testing running on ore i7 + 16 GB RAM, after rebasing #29441 on 9.2.beta5, `ptestlong` gives 9 permanent (and no transient) failures :

```
```
| File                            | Result             | P/T | Notes            |

| src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx     | 2 doctests failed  | P   | Known            |
FWIW, the same tests gave 3 permanent and one transient failures on 9.2.beta5 (identical to those reported for beta2 and beta4) :

```
```
| File                           | Result            | P/T |
|--------------------------------+-------------------+-----|
| src/sage/tests/parigp.py       | Timed out         | T   |
| src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx | 6 doctests failed | P   |
| src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py | 1 doctest failed  | P   |
| src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx    | 2 doctests failed | P   |
Most of the "new" errors seems to be bound to a runtime redefinition of SAGE_ROOT, changing from `/usr/local/sag` to `/usr/local/sage-9` (on my system, the former is a symlink to the latter, and `/usr/local/bin/sage` is a symlink to `/usr/local/sage/sage` ; this allows for a quick switch of Sage trees...).

I upload `chkerrs.txt` which is the log of re-running failed tests.

I'll retest the latest state of this branch when I have some credible indication that it is indeed intended to be stable...

I now have done so, and get identical results.

My //impression// is that this upgrade doesn't bring new detectable bugs : the "new" bugs I have found seem unrelated.

==>`positive_review`.

However, I //strongly// advise a confirmation of  this review by someone using Sage's R interpreter.
