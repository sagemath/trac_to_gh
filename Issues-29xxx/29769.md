```

The function linear_branch_number() in sage.crypto.sbox.SBox produces incorrect result for a non-invertible SBox. For example,

```
sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
sage: f = SBox([0, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 3, 7])
sage: f.linear_branch_number()
2
```

The output should be equal to 1 instead of 2.
