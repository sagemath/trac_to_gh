1. For singular, the location of the dynamic library needs to be communicated to the sage runtime.

   We add a configuration variable `SINGULAR_SO` to `sage_conf.py.in`. 

   The filename can be found from `src/Singular/libSingular.la` (currently not installed): 

  ```
  # The name that we can dlopen(3).
  dlname='libSingular-4.1.1.dylib'
  ...
  # Directory that this library needs to be installed in:
  libdir='/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/lib'
```

  This will:
- reduce the need for downstream patching (see for example https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/-/blob/master/debian/patches/d0-singular.patch),

- enable venv builds of sagelib (#30578, #29013) -- for which `_get_shared_lib_filename` is wrong

- provide preparation for adding an `spkg-configure.m4` for `singular`.


2. `src/bin/sage-env` unconditionally sets environment variable `SINGULARPATH="$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular"` 

   If `SINGULARPATH` is already set by the user, perhaps the directory in $SAGE_LOCAL should be prepended instead of overwriting it.

   (After #32254, `SINGULARPATH` is only used by `qepcad` -- this last use should be removed in #31275.)


3. `src/bin/sage-env` unconditionally sets environment variable `SINGULAR_EXECUTABLE="$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/Singular"`.  

   It should be investigated whether this is actually needed in any supported configuration. If not, remove. 

   (Removed in #32302.)

4. `src/sage/interfaces/singular.py` tries to use `SINGULARPATH` as if it is a directory name (it is a colon-separated list of directories):

```
singular_docdir = SINGULARPATH + "/../info/"
```

  This should be fixed so that it works when `SINGULARPATH` is set by a user to a colon-separated list.

  (Solved in #32254 - Obtain singular.hlp location via libsingular_resources)

[Copying elements from #29024]

- my 1st problem was a build failure with Singular taken from an external package: to solve it, Singular must be built `--with-ntl`: it would be fine to add this check to `spkg-configure.m4` (but I do not know how!)

- my 2nd error was when building dochtml: `NameError: Singular library 'freegb.lib' not found`. To solve it, `src/sage/env.py` and `src/bin/sage-env` must be modified so that `SINGULARPATH` is set to singlar's share dir (and not `SAGE_SHARE` / `DESTDIR`), and `SINGULAR_EXECUTABLE` is set to the real Singular and not under the `DESTDIR` directory.

Now it is OK for me (on FreeBSD).

Moving this ticket forward is great, but note that it is unrelated to the build problem on homebrew reported on sage-devel... and it is also unlikely that the homebrew version of singular actually works for us (homebrew does not like to patch).

As I explained in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/KXK_zxzfhIQ/RO3FryYWAwAJ, on the reporter's system the computed order of `-I` options is wrong -- something that I was not able reproduce on my system.

The fix in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) needs some programming - specifically, the code in singular.pyx calls dlopen on SINGULAR_SO,
which is computed by _get_shared_lib_filename dynamically in env.py, and assuming that it is in SAGE_LOCAL.
So this probably can instead by handled using cython_aliases from the same module (which does compute
all the needed info for Singular, it seems).
Or by fixing _get_shared_lib_filename so that it also searches elsewhere.

Is it known whether this comment added in 2009 to singular.pyx is still valid:

```
    This initializes the SINGULAR library. This is a hack to some
    extent.

    SINGULAR has a concept of compiled extension modules similar to
    Sage. For this, the compiled modules need to see the symbols from
    the main program. However, SINGULAR is a shared library in this
    context these symbols are not known globally. The work around so
    far is to load the library again and to specify ``RTLD_GLOBAL``.

Someone working on innards of Singular might know.
(I'd be surprised if it was changed).

Singular is not alone - this hack is also applied to libgap.
I'm inclined to fix `_get_shared_lib_filename` so that it can accept other libdirs, not only
SAGE_LOCAL/lib

Yes, this function certainly would need changing if we continue to use it. 
For example, `sysconfig.get_config_var('LIBDIR')` gives a directory of the system python, not of the current venv.

But I think better solution would be to wrap loading of modules that are linked to singular by [sys.setdlopenflags](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setdlopenflags).

This is what pytorch does when it has to use RTLD_GLOBAL (see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/__init__.py#L132)

<div id="comment:31" align="right">comment:31</div>

The `SINGULARPATH` is being used to find the singular's docdir so that sage can manually parse its GNU info file and retrieve the docstring for Singular functions.

Currently the help file is mis-named (https://github.com/Singular/Singular/issues/1107), but even so, there's a much more reliable way to get this information without parsing the file ourselves (and therefore, without `SINGULARPATH`):

```
$ info "(singular.hlp)align" | tail -n+2

5.1.1 align
-----------

`*Syntax:*'
     `align (' vector_expression, int_expression `)'
     `align (' module_expression, int_expression `)'

`*Type:*'
     type of the first argument

`*Purpose:*'
     maps module generators `gen(i)' to `gen(i+s)' for all i.

`*Example:*'
            ring r=0,(x,y,z),(c,dp);
            align([1,2,3],3);
          ==> [0,0,0,1,2,3]
            align([0,0,1,2,3],-1);
          ==> [0,1,2,3]
            align(freemodule(2),1);
          ==> _[1]=[0,1]
          ==> _[2]=[0,0,1]

I've left the `dlopen()` alone because I don't feel like trying to eliminate it. This branch uses autoconf to find out the extension of shared libraries on the system (`SHLIBEXT`), and then tries to `dlopen("libSingular.$SHLIBEXT")`. If it works, we use the system copy, and use the same `dlopen()` strategy in `singular.pyx`. Otherwise we fall back to the SPKG and pass the full `SAGE_LOCAL` path to `dlopen()`. Works well enough on Gentoo.

by the way, why there is no hint for `pkgconfig` in `build/pkgs/pkgconfig/distros/gentoo.txt` (and for many other obvious distros)?

I only notices as Gentoo's `emerge` was telling be about the switch to `dev-util/pkgconf`.

The Sage "pkgconfig" package is a python module and not the tool itself. There's nothing we can do with it yet, but eventually it's dev-python/pkgconfig.

In fact, do we actually install any custom Singular packages in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/LIB`? I don't think we do.

`src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py` uses the correct approach -- it loads its custom Singular library using a fully qualified path to the library, which is just in the installed package data of the Sage library.

If the `p_group_cohomology` Sage code relies on `SINGULARPATH`, it should be changed so it uses the same approach.

Not sure what "we" is here, but
`p_group_cohomology` does install a custom Singular lib, called `dickson.lib`,
and it ends up in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/LIB`, as `spkg-install` has

```
sdh_install singular_helper/dickson.lib "$SAGE_SHARE/singular/LIB/"
```
- which is fine if Singular is built by Sage, but not with the external Singular.

It doesn't rely on `SINGULARPATH` is seems to me. `SINGULARPATH` can be used by Singular,
and system-wide Singular  doesn't know about `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular/LIB`, obviously, unless something is done.

Should `p_group_cohomology` be using `$SAGE_SHARE/singular/LIB/` to install `dickson.lib`, or some
other location?

Regarding `src/sage/ext_data/singular/function_field/core.lib`,  one sees

```
            from sage.env import SAGE_EXTCODE
            lib(SAGE_EXTCODE + '/singular/function_field/core.lib')
```
but

```
$ find . -name core.lib
./pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.8/sage/ext_data/singular/function_field/core.lib
./src/sage/ext_data/singular/function_field/core.lib
./local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/ext_data/singular/function_field/core.lib
```
so it also gets installed into site-packages. Is it a bug?

`core.lib` is `package_data` of the distribution package `sagemath-standard`.
As such it gets installed alongside the Python files, in `site-packages`.

This works as designed.

I think that will fix it. I thought about eliminating `SINGULAR_LIB_BASE` entirely, but I can't say for sure that we won't encounter a platform where `dlopen()` does not search the library path, so I've left it in and invented a way to reference the libdir.

The hacks in sage_conf are starting to pile up, so I've opened #32540 with a proposal to refactor things.

Homebrew's Singular needs some fixes; 1st of all,

```diff

Then, it appears that `dlopen()` call in `singular.pyx` needs a full path to .dylib on macOS.
(it might be a Cython bug, or the plarform limitation, I don't know).
That is, if I make sure that

```
SINGULAR_LIB_BASE = "/usr/local/opt/singular/lib/libSingular"
```
in `sage_conf.py` then everything works. I am not sure how to achieve the latter automatically. 
One way might be to export a special env. var. in  `.homebrew-build-env` and use it to set up the proper
`SINGULAR_LIB_BASE` in `spkg-configure.m4` - but there could be a better way.

Yes, `env.py` is part of sagelib. Actually, a simple fallback to `SINGULAR_LIB_PATH="libSingular.so"` would be fine for me (if any distro modifies the default library name, I guess it's their job to patch sage accordingly or provide a custom sage_conf)

No, I haven't tested yet. I'll have to run it on GH.

Even if $libdir isn't being used... at some point, the build system is deciding to put those dlls into a $directory, and $directory=bin on cygwin while $directory=lib everywhere else, no? I don't suppose you know where that decision is made?

This was a conscious choice, as da802ef now makes explicit. POSIX doesn't say what will happen if you use a filename without a path in `dlopen()`, so the SPKG is still used as a fallback on systems where it doesn't work.

There are a couple options to improve this, of varying difficulty:

* We could try to get the libdir from Singular itself. The `feResource.cc` file provides a bunch of other configuration information, but not the bare libdir at the moment. We could provide a patch upstream that lets us obtain its libdir. (However, the cygwin discussion is suggesting that libdir may not always be the right place?)
* We can eliminate the `dlopen()`, if possible. We already link directly to libSingular and that's easy to do portably with `-lSingular`. I'm not entirely sure why `dlopen()` is needed, but the `init_libsingular()` documentation says

```python

I think it has to do with cygwin fork() design, Windows address space, rebasing... DLL needs to get a fixed memory address allocation, for fork() to work), and so `bin/` is what's beging scanned by the corresponding Cygwin utility `rebaseall`.

Is that an option? Can I wrap the whole thing in `if [ $(whoami) = "mjo" ]`?

The rebaseall thing makes some amount of sense to me (I used cygwin back when Windows XP was around), but I'm still not sure exactly when the dlls either get installed directly to bin, or moved from lib to bin.

  # DLL is installed to $(libdir)/../bin by postinstall_cmds

On cygwin the SPKG will always be used because its Singular is too old. But even that was failing, because the absolute path involving "lib" was wrong. It should be fixed now.

Remaining questions:

1. Do I need to use "cygSingular" as the library name on Cygwin?
2. WTF is happening on macOS?

I suppose we need to supply the full path to DLL (.e.g. .dylib), via an env. var in `.homebrew-build-env` and forget about it.
(Not sure about Conda).

One discrepancy I noticed is that that singular.pyx is compiled as C++,
while the test in spkg-configure is done with plain C; I tried with C++, saw no difference.

> you do non-nested calls where they can and should be nested. slows down `./configure` for no reason.

I find the logic much easier to understand when the "else" branch of a test is not separated from the test by an entire page. Ideally I would be able to put something like `return;` after each `sage_spkg_install_singular=yes`, but I don't know of a reliable way to accomplish that.

Running "make" takes many hours, so an extra second or two on systems without Singular didn't seem like a huge problem. And those of us who work on the build system and run `./configure` repeatedly should be clever enough to install it. But I could still nest them if that's a deal-breaker for you.

Do some coding in Lisp, then, for the training purposes ;-)

Also, nesting makes sure that the output in case of errors is meaningful - it just errors on the 1st failing place, and that's it.

I don't have a comment on using the homebrew singular package; I haven't tested this ticket. 

The issue lies in *installing* the singular package on homebrew when a non-standard prefix (= not /usr/local) is in use -- which is what our testing workflows on GH Actions do.

The homebrew docs pretty clearly say "Pick another prefix at your peril!"

If singular works well in a supported homebrew configuration, it's mean to hide the system package suggestion from everyone for the sake of an unsupported, non-user-facing test scenario.

Can't we add a `sed "/singular/d"` somewhere in that GH action, closer to where the problem originates, to fix it?

On Debian 11 (a.k.a. bullseye, stable) Singular's libs have different names, and are failing to be picked up: they all are installed in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` and we have the following: I add Sage's names next to their

```
Debian                             Sage

libsingular-factory.so             libfactory.so
libsingular-gfan.so                ???
libsingular-omalloc.so             libomalloc.so
libsingular-polys.so               libpolys.so
libsingular-resources.so           libsingular_resources.so
libsingular-Singular.so            libSingular.so            
```

While it's not hard to test for `libsingular-Singular.so` in place of `libSingular.so`, it's some more work to use it.

Library names may be obtained from `$ pkg-config --libs-only-l singular`, which on Debian produces

```
-lsingular-Singular -ldl -lsingular-polys -lntl -lgmp -ldl -lsingular-factory -lntl -lgmp -lsingular-omalloc -lsingular-resources
```

I suppose this needs a followup ticket.

File a bug? Sometimes, people are going to want to use non-debian packages on debian. The name of the library is libSingular, and that's what everyone will (and should) try to use. It's as fundamental to the API as anything can be.

There's probably a name conflict with some other library that is better avoided some other way, e.g. by having the two packages with conflicting files block each other. Or at the very least, by renaming only the problematic library. I doubt some other package is installing `libSingular.so`.
