Something that you could try that might get some extra speed out is store the lengths of the positions in an array, then iterate `j` and `k` over those values. So something like this:

```python
    cdef Py_ssize_t *pos_lens = <Py_ssize_t*> sig_malloc(len(positions)*sizeof(Py_ssize_t))
    cdef Py_ssize_t jind
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for jind in range(pos_lens[i]):
            j = <int> (positions[jind])
    sig_free(pos_lens)
```
At least where iterating over `j` and `k` is where the C code looks somewhat bad. You probably also want to put a `sig_check` at least somewhere within one of those loops so it can catch interrupts.

It probably would be good to instead of creating a new matrix and then setting the entries, to create a `__new__` matrix and set the `A._matrix = M` so you don't move things around in memory so much.

ok, I will try to think about that. In my use case, the time-consuming step is not this one, but the computation of the charpoly that follows, and where magma is blazingly fast compared to Flint.

Would you be so kind to explain a little bit more, or give me an example file to look at ?

I finally have gotten to this. So my code was slightly wrong, but easy enough to fix.

Timings with your branch:

```
sage: P1 = posets.BooleanLattice(5)
sage: P2 = posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset(5)
sage: P3 = posets.YoungDiagramPoset(Partition([9,5,5,5,4,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))
sage: P4 = posets.TamariLattice(5,3); P4
Finite lattice containing 969 elements
sage: P5 = posets.TamariLattice(8); P5
Finite lattice containing 1430 elements

sage: %time _ = P1._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 3.8 ms, total: 3.8 ms
Wall time: 3.72 ms

sage: %time _ = P2._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 17.2 ms, sys: 7 µs, total: 17.2 ms
Wall time: 17.1 ms

sage: %time _ = P3._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 955 µs, sys: 89 µs, total: 1.04 ms
Wall time: 1.05 ms

sage: %time _ = P4._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 339 ms, sys: 4.15 ms, total: 343 ms
Wall time: 342 ms

sage: %time _ = P5._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 577 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 585 ms
Wall time: 584 ms
```
versus with my branch:

```
sage: %time _ = P1._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 1.77 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.77 ms
Wall time: 1.78 ms

sage: %time _ = P2._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 8.77 ms, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 12.8 ms
Wall time: 13.4 ms

sage: %time _ = P3._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 873 µs, sys: 81 µs, total: 954 µs
Wall time: 965 µs

sage: %time _ = P4._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 302 ms, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 306 ms
Wall time: 305 ms

sage: %time _ = P5._hasse_diagram.coxeter_transformation()
CPU times: user 535 ms, sys: 11.7 ms, total: 547 ms
Wall time: 549 ms
```

So I am seeing regularly a 10% speedup to the Coxeter transformation code (the larger differences seem more to be noise).

I've set the branch in case you want to use it. If you don't then you can revert back to your branch and set a positive review.
