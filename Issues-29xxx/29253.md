```
In Sage 9.3.rc2:

```
sage: integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(1/x - 1/4), x, 0, 5)
1/2*integrate(sqrt(x - 1)*sqrt(4/x - 1), x, 0, 5)
```
However

- `sqrt(x - 1)` is not defined for `x < 1`
- `sqrt(1/x - 1/4)` is not defined for `x > 4`

and it is not evaluating the given expression.

What would you expect when feeding Sage this input?

There are ways to make sense of the integral
if we understand `sqrt` as taking complex values.
