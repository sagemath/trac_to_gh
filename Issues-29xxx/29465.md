This ticket fixes a sign error in the method `cohomology_decomposition` in `asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions.py`. This problem currently blocks the upgrade of Singular [ticket:25993#comment:62].

The method `cohomology_decomposition` of `FractionWithFactoredDenominator` computes a cohomologous form in which each factor in the denominator appears to the power of at most one. The implementation very closely follows the proof of [AY1983, Theorem 17.4](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/references/index.html#ay1983).

The sign error arises as follows. In equation (17.11), the form is written in coordinates

```
dz_{j_1} ∧ … ∧ dz_{j_m} ∧ dz_1 ∧ … [j_1,…,j_m] … ∧ dz_n
```
so that the indices `j_1,…,j_m` appear before the other indices, and therefore the parity sign `ε[J]` of the permutation that sorts the `j_1,…,j_m` to the front appears in this equation.

The computation in Sage however represents the form as `dz_1 ∧ … ∧ dz_n` without permuting – after all, it takes the sum of multiple such terms – and therefore the parity sign should not be used in this computation, but currently it is. (In the implemetation, `[z_1,…,z_n]` is called `X`.)

An example that fails:

```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions import FractionWithFactoredDenominatorRing
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: FFPD = FractionWithFactoredDenominatorRing(R)
sage: p = 1
sage: qs = [(x*y - 1, 1), (x**2 + y**2 - 1, 2)]
sage: f = FFPD(p, qs)
sage: f.cohomology_decomposition()
(0, []) + (4/3*x*y + 4/3, [(x^2 + y^2 - 1, 1)]) + (1/3, [(x*y - 1, 1), (x^2 + y^2 - 1, 1)])
```

One can check using pen and paper that the correct result in this case would be:

```
(0, []) + (-4/3*x*y, [(x^2 + y^2 - 1, 1)]) + (1/3, [(x*y - 1, 1), (x^2 + y^2 - 1, 1)])
```

(Though note that the result depends on the concrete choice of Nullstellensatz representatives in the call to `lift()`.)

In particular this ticket solves the problem mentioned in [ticket:25993#comment:62] that the `relative_error` does not become small when Singular 4.1.2p4 chooses different representatives in the call to `lift()`.

The internally used function `permutation_sign` is not needed anymore and therefore deprecated.

Wow, you have been digging deep! Do you by any chance have an e-copy of [AY1983]?

By the way, is there a meausure-theoretic meaning to these differential forms, in the sense that they might be approximating integration over a semialgebraic (?) set determined by the demoninator w.r.t. to the density specified by the numerator?

At least this is that case if the denominator is a product of linear functions.
(there, the linear functions correspond to vertices of a polyhedron, and the integration
is over this polyhedron, with piecewise-polynomial denisties).

Sorry, I don't.

I wish I could answer this question. It is something I would be interested in myself as well.
