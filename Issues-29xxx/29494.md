We shouldn't accept a system pari, if it has known bug reported in #28789.

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: u = x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(u)
sage: C.frobenius_polynomial()
x^8 + 731*x^7 + 6*x^6 - 720*x^5 + 18*x^4 - 2160*x^3 + 54*x^2 + 19737*x + 81
```

The corresponding doctests fails e.g. on debian buster [https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/576167329](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/576167329) or [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655855](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655855)

We fix this by rejecting pari if it has that bug.

Depends on #29445

If we copy/paste every upstream test into a sage doctest and then copy/paste every sage doctest into spkg-configure.m4, we're going to wind up (a) spending a whole lot of time, and (b) ultimately forcing the exact same version of and patches to pari that sage ships with anyway.

This doctest (and others like it) should just be deleted now that we're using system packages.

Alternatively to this approach, we can move the minimal pari version up to 2.11.2. This would also solve it.

I just don't think it is right to accept a system package, where we know it has a bug leading to a mathematical incorrect answer.

This approach leaves you with the empty set =)

The absolute best you can do is to not accept a system package that doesn't fail any sage doctests, where certain sage doctests for the correct answers have not yet been added because the SPKG that ships with sage produces the wrong ones. But then you're just forcing the exact same version/patches of the package that ships with sage. I can certainly go find a bug in pari-2.11.2 that was fixed in pari-2.11.3 and add a doctest for it, and then retroactively decide that we must not allow that bug in sage. The same is true of (almost) every new version of (almost) every package.

For best results, users should upgrade their system packages to the latest available versions... as with any software. Old versions have bugs and security vulnerabilities fixed in the new ones. Anything API compatible should be accepted IMO.

It's an awkward position to be arguing against correctness =)

My point is mainly that every mathematical bug fixed in pari-2.11.3 is present in sage if we accept pari-2.11.2 from the system. Is that OK? If not, then copy/pasting the upstream tests into sage and then copy/pasting sage tests into spkg-configure.m4 is an extremely roundabout way of only accepting pari-2.11.3 on the system.

This was fixed in the update:

```
sage: M1 = matrix(ZZ,[[16,6],[6,10]])
sage: M2 = matrix(ZZ,[[4,3],[3,10]])
sage: Q1 = QuadraticForm(M1)
sage: Q2 = QuadraticForm(M2)
sage: Q1.is_globally_equivalent_to(Q2)
False
sage: Q2.is_globally_equivalent_to(Q1)
True
```

Should we add a doctest to the sage library for that bug, and thus add it to spkg-configure.m4 as well to avoid doctest failures? If not, what makes this different from the hyperellcharpoly bug?
