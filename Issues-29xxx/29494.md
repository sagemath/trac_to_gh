We shouldn't accept a system pari, if it has known bug reported in #28789.

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: u = x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(u)
sage: C.frobenius_polynomial()
x^8 + 731*x^7 + 6*x^6 - 720*x^5 + 18*x^4 - 2160*x^3 + 54*x^2 + 19737*x + 81
```

The corresponding doctests fails e.g. on debian buster [https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/576167329](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/576167329) or [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655855](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/542655855)

We fix this by rejecting pari if it has that bug.

This approach leaves you with the empty set =)

The absolute best you can do is to not accept a system package that doesn't fail any sage doctests, where certain sage doctests for the correct answers have not yet been added because the SPKG that ships with sage produces the wrong ones. But then you're just forcing the exact same version/patches of the package that ships with sage. I can certainly go find a bug in pari-2.11.2 that was fixed in pari-2.11.3 and add a doctest for it, and then retroactively decide that we must not allow that bug in sage. The same is true of (almost) every new version of (almost) every package.

For best results, users should upgrade their system packages to the latest available versions... as with any software. Old versions have bugs and security vulnerabilities fixed in the new ones. Anything API compatible should be accepted IMO.

My point is mainly that every mathematical bug fixed in pari-2.11.3 is present in sage if we accept pari-2.11.2 from the system. Is that OK? If not, then copy/pasting the upstream tests into sage and then copy/pasting sage tests into spkg-configure.m4 is an extremely roundabout way of only accepting pari-2.11.3 on the system.

Indeed it looks like your correct:

```diff
-expected="%1 = x^8 + 731*x^7 + 6*x^6 - 720*x^5 + 18*x^4 - 2160*x^3 + 54*x^2 + 19737*x + 81"

```

Looks like I copied the wrong result (I manually installed the broken pari, to see what the test should look like and then I copied from the wrong source. My bad.
