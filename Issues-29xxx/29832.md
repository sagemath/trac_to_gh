It seems that `neglex` used there isn't the right order, for it's not even a Groebner basis order. See

https://ask.sagemath.org/question/51851/toric-ideal-of-point-configuration-yielding-whole-ring/

for details and an example showing a meaningless answer from Sage.
Namely the following is wrong:

```
sage: A = matrix([[1,0,0,0,-1,-1,-2],[0,1,0,-1,-1,-2,-3]])
....: IA = ToricIdeal(A); IA
....: 
Ideal (1) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in z0, z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6 over Rational Field
```


IMHO it should be something like `degrevlex` instead. Or, indeed, Signular provides weighted orders that can be used.
