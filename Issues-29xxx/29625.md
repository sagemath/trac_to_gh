As a follow-up to #29543, this ticket changes the `normal_basis` method of ideals to handle the case of weighted term orders.

With this change, the degree of the monomials in the normal basis is taken with respect to the weighted degree (which agrees with Sage's notion of degree).

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order=TermOrder('wdegrevlex', (1, 2, 3)))
sage: I = R.ideal(x*y^2 + x^5, z*y + x^3*y)
sage: I.normal_basis(degree=9)
[x^2*y^2*z, x^3*z^2, x*y*z^2, z^3]
sage: all(f.degree() == 9 for f in _)
True
```

This also came up in an [Ask SageMath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47623).

The implementation uses the Singular function [weightKB](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-2/sing_377.htm#SEC417).
