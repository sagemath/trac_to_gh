As observed in #29084, ​fflas_ffpack compilation fails on a processor that supports AVX512 extensions with the default compiler on Ubuntu Trusty - gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4).

See `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` run at ​https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/414021553

As noted in ​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ, this problem prevents Sage from build on other major platforms: `ubuntu-trusty-standard`, `debian-jessie-standard`, `centos-7-minimal/standard`.


In this ticket, we check which architecture flags are supported by the compiler, and disable the unsupported ones by passing options to the `configure` script of `fflas_ffpack`. (Because of bugs in fflas_ffpack's configuration scripts, the flags for individual AVX512 variants are not handled individually.)

(Upstream indicates that they plan configuration changes in the longer term to address similar issues. Not the same upstream issue: https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/284 (that's #29161).)

This now actually works and fixes installation on `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/432608426?check_suite_focus=true).

But with this fix there's an error on `debian-jessie-standard` https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/432608838?check_suite_focus=true
Here the compiler supports only one of the avx512 flags.

This breaks linbox on fresh builds:

```
-----------------------------------------------
Default path = /var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage2_git/build/local /usr /usr/local 
checking whether to compile the drivers... no
-----------------------------------------------
checking for pkg-config... /var/lib/buildbot/slave/sage2_git/build/local/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for FFLAS_FFPACK... no
configure: error: Package requirements (fflas-ffpack >= 2.4.0) were not met:
Package fflas-ffpack was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `fflas-ffpack.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
Package 'fflas-ffpack', required by 'world', not found
Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.
Alternatively, you may set the environment variables FFLAS_FFPACK_CFLAGS
and FFLAS_FFPACK_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

Anyone interested in completing the review of this ticket? As noted many times in sage-release, most recently in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ, this problem prevents Sage from build on major platforms: ubuntu-trusty-minimal/standard, debian-jessie-standard, centos-7-minimal/standard.

Fedora builds fail due to the inability to build numpy, probably related to *blas.pc issue.

For example, if you look at `ubuntu-trusty-minimal`, which had an fflas_ffpack failure, this now builds Sage correctly (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/524022952) and runs its test suite:

```
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/degenerate_submanifold.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/euclidean.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/metric.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/plot/plot.py  # Timed out
sage -t src/sage/rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py  # Timed out
