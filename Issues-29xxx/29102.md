```
As observed in #29084, ​fflas_ffpack compilation fails on a processor that supports AVX512 extensions with the default compiler on Ubuntu Trusty - gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4).

See `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` run at ​https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/414021553

As noted in ​https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ, this problem prevents Sage from build on other major platforms: `ubuntu-trusty-standard`, `debian-jessie-standard`, `centos-7-minimal/standard`.


In this ticket, we check which architecture flags are supported by the compiler, and disable the unsupported ones by passing options to the `configure` script of `fflas_ffpack`. (Because of bugs in fflas_ffpack's configuration scripts, the flags for individual AVX512 variants are not handled individually.)

(Upstream indicates that they plan configuration changes in the longer term to address similar issues. Not the same upstream issue: https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/284 (that's #29161).)

But with this fix there's an error on `debian-jessie-standard` https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/432608838?check_suite_focus=true
Here the compiler supports only one of the avx512 flags.
