I tagged a new release of symmetrica with all of the build/crash fixes from over the years:

* https://gitlab.com/sagemath/symmetrica/-/releases
* https://gitlab.com/sagemath/symmetrica/uploads/b3d8e1ad5ab2449c30bbc3147e7a5e53/symmetrica-3.0.1.tar.xz

A standard ./configure && make && make install should suffice, with no patching.

`CFLAGS="-O2"` should suffice. The preprocessor definitions are made automatically now in `src/Makefile.am`:

```
# -DFAST disables some runtime checks in src/macro.h to speed things up.
#
# -DALLTRUE defines a bunch of other constants in def.h that ultimately
# enable every symmetrica "subsystem."
libsymmetrica_la_CPPFLAGS = -DFAST -DALLTRUE
```

The `cd src` can also be dropped. Right now, `src` is the only subdirectory with a test suite, but `make check` at the top level runs is what runs them all.
