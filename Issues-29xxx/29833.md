```
Mathematica may return exp(x) as `E^x`. This is missed by our current translation to Sage, both in the `sage` method of objects with `Mathematica` parent and in the "mathematica_free" integrator.

Clarification by exemple:

```
var('x a b')
(x, a, b)
assume(b > 0)
f = (exp((x-a)/b) + 1)**(-1)
(f*f).integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free")
-b*log(1/E^((a - x)/b) + 1) + x + b/(1/E^((a - x)/b) + 1)
```

Exploration shows that in this symbolic expression, E is taken as the Gap function E (returns the "n"-th root of unity as an element of the universal cyclotomic field).

However:

```
mathematica.Integrate(f^2,x).sage(locals={"E":e})
-b*log(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1) + x + b/(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1)
```

which is correct:

```
integrate(f^2,x)
-b*log(e^(-a/b + x/b) + 1) - a + x + b/(e^(-a/b + x/b) + 1)
```

This simple workaround, however, cannot be used with Sage objects returned by `integrate(..., algorithm="mathematica_free")`. A fix to our translation is needed. It doesn't seems obvious, since `e` translation is handled by `exp`.

This can be solved by adding `E` to the symbol table, which takes care of the conversion from Mathematica to Sage. This should probably be added to `sage.symbolic.constants`.

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import register_symbol
sage: register_symbol(e, {'mathematica': 'E'})
sage: (f*f).integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free")
-b*log(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1) + x + b/(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1)

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A2):
> That's right, that is the correct place to handle such translations.

This won't work. From `src/sage/symbolic/constants.py`:

```
# The base of the natural logarithm, e, is not a constant in GiNaC/Sage. It is
# represented by exp(1). A dummy class to make this work with arithmetic and
# coercion is implemented in the module sage.symbolic.constants_c for speed.
```

At the time other constants are initialized by `constants.pyx`, `e` isn't yet available. And I wasn't able to make it available at the end of the `_init__` method for exponentian in `constant_c.pyx`.

Hints ?

Thanks for fixing this, that was definitely an oversight - Maxima also has a weird symbol for `e` but we handle that with a perhaps somewhat stupid removal of `%` signs in strings, if I recall correctly, which wouldn't work so well here.  A few comments:
* You might as well add the original example as a test somewhere (perhaps in the integration file), because that provides an opportunity to test for regression in two ways then - one with people who have Mathematica, the other with people who might run internet tests.  Something like this?

```
    sage: (x,a,b)=var('x a b')
    sage: assume(b > 0)
    sage: f = (exp((x-a)/b) + 1)**(-1)
    sage: (f*f).integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free")  # optional -- internet
    -b*log(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1) + x + b/(e^(-(a - x)/b) + 1)
```
* You have this already earlier in the file:

```
from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import register_symbol, I
```
  and the function is used, so do you need the whole `foo` construction?  Seems like `register_symbol` should be available.
* `bachtranslated` -> I am a big fan of Bach, but didn't know he also was responsible for the natural base of the logarithm! :-)
