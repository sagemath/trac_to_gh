Follow-up from #30396, where libtool's fallback to static library build for `giac` caused linker errors while building sagelib.

This is fixed by passing `-no-undefined` to the libtool linking flags, by setting `AM_LDFLAGS=-no-undefined`.

Affected packages can be found as follows:

```
$ grep "undefined symbols not allowed" logs/pkgs/*
cliquer-1.21.p4.log:libtool: link: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-unknown-cygwin shared libraries
giac-1.5.0.87p0.log:libtool: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-pc-cygwin shared libraries; building static only
libbraiding-1.0.p0.log:libtool: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-unknown-cygwin shared libraries; building static only
rw-0.7.p0.log:libtool: link: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-unknown-cygwin shared libraries
singular-4.1.1p2.p0.log:libtool: warning: undefined symbols not allowed in x86_64-unknown-cygwin shared libraries; building static only
```

In `singular`, only the `gitfan.la` library (module) is affected:

```
Making all in gitfan
...

libtool: link: ranlib .libs/gitfan.a
libtool: link: ( cd ".libs" && rm -f "gitfan.la" && ln -s "../gitfan.la" "gitfan.la" )
```

The issue also affects the optional package `meataxe`.

```
[meataxe-1.0.p0] /usr/bin/bash ../libtool  --tag=CC   --mode=link gcc  -g -O2  -L/opt/sagemath-9.0/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/sagemath-9.0/local/lib  -o libmtx.la -rpath /opt/sagemath-9.0/local/lib args.lo berlekmp.lo bsand.lo bscore.lo bsdup.lo bsissub.lo bsmatch.lo bsminus.lo bsop.lo bsor.lo bsprint.lo bsread.lo bswrite.lo cfinfo.lo charpol.lo chbasis.lo error.lo ffio.lo fpcore.lo fpdup.lo fpmul.lo fpmul2.lo fpprint.lo gcd.lo genseed.lo grmaprow.lo grmatcore.lo grtable.lo homcomp.lo imatcore.lo imatread.lo imatwrite.lo init.lo intio.lo issub.lo isisom.lo kernel-0.lo ldiag.lo maddmul.lo mat2vec.lo matadd.lo matclean.lo matcmp.lo maketabF.lo matcopy.lo matcore.lo matcut.lo matdup.lo matech.lo matid.lo matins.lo matinv.lo matmul.lo matnull.lo matorder.lo matpivot.lo matprint.lo matpwr.lo matread.lo mattr.lo mattrace.lo matwrite.lo message.lo mfcore.lo mfread.lo mfreadlong.lo mfwrite.lo mfwritelong.lo minpol.lo mkendo.lo mmulscal.lo mraddgen.lo mrcore.lo mrread.lo mrtranspose.lo mrwrite.lo msclean.lo mscore.lo mtensor.lo mtxobj.lo os.lo permcmp.lo permcore.lo permdup.lo perminv.lo permmul.lo permorder.lo permprint.lo permpwr.lo permread.lo permwrite.lo poladd.lo polcmp.lo polcore.lo polderive.lo poldiv.lo poldup.lo polgcd.lo polmul.lo polprint.lo polread.lo polwrite.lo quotient.lo random.lo rdcfgen.lo saction.lo setcore.lo setinsert.lo settest.lo spinup.lo spinup2.lo split.lo stabpwr.lo stfcore.lo stfread.lo stfwrite.lo string.lo sumint.lo temap.lo tkinfo.lo vec2mat.lo wgen.lo window.lo zcleanrow.lo zcmprow.lo zgap.lo zpermrow.lo zzz2.lo
[meataxe-1.0.p0] libtool:   error: can't build x86_64-unknown-cygwin shared library unless -no-undefined is specified
```

This is a common issue especially when using libtool to link Windows DLLs and should hopefully be straightforward to fix.

<a id='comment:26'></a>The `-no-undefined` is only needed when building a shared library, so the flag can be appended in e.g.

```
libfoo_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined
```

rather than the global

```
AM_LDFLAGS=-no-undefined
```

that will affect all link operations (including executables). It probably doesn't hurt much, but I remember vaguely that `--as-needed` was nicer than `--no-undefined` if you were going to apply it globally.

I also think most projects should have `LT_INIT([disable-static])` in configure.ac these days, to disable the static libraries by default. They can still be enabled with `--enable-static`, but for most people they're a waste of time/space.

Yes, it's a trick that I have been using recently. The URL shows in ticket lists such as https://trac.sagemath.org/report/92?asc=1&page=1 and this reminds me (or other developers) to inspect these automatic builds when they are done.

They will be replaced by actual reviewer names when ready.

We cannot test automatically (on github), but a developer with a cygwin machine certainly could...

We seem to be in short supply of these...

I have modified the CI script so that the scipy failure does not stop the whole build.

The resulting build logs (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/suites/1285136303/artifacts/20016238) show that `cliquer`, `giac`, `meataxe`, and `rw`, i.e., all packages mentioned in the ticket description except for `libbraiding` (for which the branch contains an update) and `singular` (for which the branch does not contain a change) are OK now. 
Some optional packages were not built previously. In total, we now have the following remaining issues:
