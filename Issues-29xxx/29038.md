This ticket introduces a new Python package `sage_conf`.

- sage-the-distribution will generate this Python package at `./configure` time and install it at build time before starting to build/install sagelib using `src/setup.py`.
- Distributions will generate and install their own `sage_conf` by a method of their choice before starting to build/install sagelib.

A `console_script` allows to query individual variable values from the shell, or output all variables in .env format:

```
$ local/bin/sage-config MAXIMA
/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/bin/maxima
$ local/bin/sage-config
VERSION=9.1.beta0
MAXIMA=/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/bin/maxima
SAGE_LOCAL=/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local
SAGE_ROOT=/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring
```

The module and the script are used as follows:

1. It provides configuration information to sagelib at installation time (`src/setup.py`).

   Ultimately we want to be able to install sagelib with `pip`. To support installation by `pip` from PyPI, from an URL, etc., we cannot expect to configure the build like we do now, by writing the configuration to the file `src/sage-env-config`. Moreover, if pip is running in `--isolated` mode, also no environment variables are passed. Then the only information flow is through arguments to `pip build` and through the installed Python packages. By installing `sage_conf` first, we make the configuration available to the pip install of sagelib.

2. It provides configuration information to the docbuild, in particular about the install locations of documentation of external packages.

3. It provides configuration information to the runtime of sagelib, making sagelib more independent from the environment variables set by `src/bin/sage-env` (`local/bin/sage-env`).

a. By providing `SAGE_LOCAL` as one the configuration variables, it removes assumptions regarding install locations of `sagelib` relative to `$SAGE_LOCAL`. This enables the following: 
- Installing an experimental version of `sagelib` in other install locations, such as in a user site packages directory.
- Making `sagelib` available in a user's venv, as in the following example:
   Without this ticket:

   ```
   $ sage -python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/personal-sage-venv/
   $ source ~/personal-sage-venv/bin/activate
   (personal-sage-venv) $ python
   >>> import sage.env
   >>> sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL
   '/Users/mkoeppe/personal-sage-venv'                                     # wrong
   >>> import sage.all
   RuntimeError: You must get the file local/bin/sage-maxima.lisp
   ```
   With this ticket:

   ```
   >>> sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL
   '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local'
   >>> import sage.all
   >>> sage.all.maxima('1')
   1

\begin{lament}

An annoying thing is that `sage -f sage_conf` did cause `./configure` to be run like 4 or 5 times, I really lost count. 
This is a by-product of `sage -f/-i` changing the configuration.
See #27373.

I really think we should get rid of these snowflake `sage -f/-i` and do `./configure && make` :-)

<div id="comment:39" align="right">Comment 39</div>

The idea of making this `type=script` make sense to me, but that isn't used very often so it hasn't been well tested.  If you look at what happens with a type=script package, it's installed like this:

```
# ============================= script packages ==============================
# Generate build rules for 'script' packages; this template is used to generate
# two rules in the form:
#
# <pkgname>: <dependencies>
#     $(AM_V_at)cd '$SAGE_ROOT' && \\
#         source '$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env' && \\
#         sage-logger -p '$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<pkgname>/spkg-install' '$(SAGE_LOGS)/<pkgname>.log'
```

So it already sources `sage-env`, but not `sage-dist-helpers`.  

Looking at the handful of other `spkg-install` scripts for the type=script packages, they might not work properly anyways since they don't get the "wrapper" treatment that other spkg-install scripts now get from `sage-spkg` (that didn't used to be the case.  

I would make the splitting up of sage-env a prerequisite to this, and at a minimum ensure that sage-dist-helpers is already sourced in the build env.  Then you could do away with the extra boilerplate at the top of the `spkg-install` for this.

In the `setup.cfg` this should not be necessary:

Not to sound like a broken record, but I don't understand the purpose of making this a whole Python module instead of a plain text file.  In some ways this makes things even worse for packagers, because now to package `sage_config` they have to hand-patch this Python module.

That said, having a generated Python file for this configuration is something I'd bend on.  I don't think it needs to be a .py module but *shrug*.  I added a comment on #29022 which I hope clarifies what I think this should be.

I *do* like that addition of a `sage-config` script.  That could just be part of the `sage` package itself though; no need for an module external to `sage` that I can see.

```
# sage/env.py
...

SAGE_ENV_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'sage.env')
with open(SAGE_ENV_FILE) as sage_env:
    for line in sage_env:
        key, value = line.split('=', 1)
        os.environ[key] = value

...
```

This format has the advantage that it can also be sourced by a shell script as it's valid shell syntax.

This is just a suggestion though; the .py equivalent is almost the same except with spaces around the `=`.

Another version, if you require that the values are quoted (so that it's simultaneously valid shell syntax and Python syntax):

```
with open(SAGE_ENV_FILE) as sage_env:
    exec(sage_env.read(), os.environ)
```

Or, if we prefer not to override things in `os.environ` we can use `globals()` instead.

Point being, it's a few lines.

I like this because even if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is not "activated" (`sage-env` not sourced), you can run `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python -c 'import sage'` and have a working environment.  The necessary environment variables can then also be passed to Sage's external dependencies, without any requirement of modifying the outer shell environment.  To me, that's the primary motivation.  That motivation can still be achieved even if the generated file is a .py module, which is why I'm more open to that; I'm just trying to show that it doesn't  gain all that much in simplicity either.

No, to the contrary. This ticket defines a functional interface to configuration: to the shell, by `sage-config`, to Python, by importing the module `sage_conf` and reading its variables. 

The version of `sage_conf` provided in `build/pkgs` is just a reference implementation of the functional interface that sage-the-distribution uses.

Packagers will just be able to generate a `sage_conf` module in any way they like. 


I have chosen this design (external to the `src` directory, a Python module rather than a configuration file) for the following reasons:
- committing to a functional interface is more flexible than (1) committing to configuration by a static file written at installation time; (2) (less importantly) to a particular file format for that.
- for example, a binary distribution may decide to ship a version of `sage_conf` that is more dynamic: It could discover some settings at its runtime.
- it is not part of the `src` directory; in this way it is working towards the goals of (a) distributors being able to use the whole unmodified `src` tree; (b) pip installability of the unmodified `src` tree.

Without the `del print_function`, `sage-config` would print a line `print_function=_Feature((2, 6, 0, 'alpha', 2), (3, 0, 0, 'alpha', 0), 65536)`.

But I have simplified the module by avoiding `print` altogether.

I don't really know what you mean by "functional" here.  Do you mean executable?  Why?  Is there a specific reason for that?  In any case I know of all that's needed here is at most a list of environment variables.  In many cases this will just be static.  If a packager has a need to generate some values for those variables programmatically they can do so however they like, but now they have to write a whole Python script that implements some undocumented interface.

No problem. I know that it is not always possible to keep up with all developments when there are more important things to do.

As you see in that plan in #21707, the present ticket on `sage_conf` was a step to cleaning up the sage-env mess. 

It has little to do with my venv-python3 tickets (which I haven't had time to work on). (In fact, I now think that your version at #29032 may, after all, be the simpler way to go at it -- but I have to get back to the python3-spkg-configure business later.)

So there's no need to mix any "venv" discussion into the "sagelib configuration" discussion.

The "regression" caused by this ticket is one that is affecting developers who switch between new and old branches. It is fixed by just merging current develop into the old branch.

cf. [`sysconfig`].

No, obviously Python needs to do some non-Pythonic things under the hood, but then the interface is Pythonic, and `sysconfig` is an example of such an approach.
You are somehow against this approach, you say that such wrapping is too complicated, so it should not be done - if you were Python BDFL, you'd not have allowed `sysconfig` in.

For tickets where merging the current `develop` is not easy, I have prepared #29120 - One-line fix for "./configure is too sensitive to stray files/subdirectories".
