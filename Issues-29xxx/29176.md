We fix a bug that was exposed computing an inexact Voronoi Diagram (see below).

`cdd` already computes the incidence matrix, we expose it in this ticket.

When deciding whether or not a vertex lies on a hyperplane for inexact polyhedra, we allow numerical noise up to absolute value of `1e-6`. This might be a bad choice depending on the size of the polyhedron as witnessed in the following example:

```

sage: e = [[11582947.657000002, 5374.38, 4177.06, 1.0], [11562795.9322, 5373.62, 4168.38, 1.0]]
sage: p = Polyhedron(ieqs=e); p
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 2 rays, 1 line
sage: p.incidence_matrix()
[0 0]
[0 0]
[0 1]
[0 0]
```

Setting the cache of incidence matrix to the matrix that `cdd` already computed for us produces the correct output:

```
sage: p.incidence_matrix()
[1 1]
[1 0]
[0 1]
[1 1]
```

This fixes the error reported here:

https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49749/voronoidiagram-returns-empty-regions/

The following should give two non-empty regions

```
sage: P = [[-2687.19, -2088.53], [-2686.81, -2084.19]]
....: V = VoronoiDiagram(P)
....: R = V.regions()
....: 
sage: R
{P(-2687.19000000000, -2088.53000000000): The empty polyhedron in RDF^0,
 P(-2686.81000000000, -2084.19000000000): A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
```

With this ticket we obtain:

```
sage: R
{P(-2687.19000000000, -2088.53000000000): A 2-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 1 ray, 1 line,
 P(-2686.81000000000, -2084.19000000000): A 2-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 1 ray, 1 line}
```

This can and should be solved by fetching the incidences from cdd.

I will try to do so. This might get rid of a lot of numerical inconsistencies.
