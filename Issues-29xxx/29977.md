> I don't blame you. I'm just trying to explain why doctesting sets works usually fine, but not in this case. I also added you, to figure out, whether we need sorting at all. But apparently yes and apparently sorting by strings is an easy solution for now.


Do you have some evidence that we have to sort the lists ? The problem with sorting is that examples are not easy to understand for users (usually not involved in doctesting).

`Pi.characters()` is stable on my machines. But `set(Pi.characters())` isn't. I'm asking you, whether there is a reason to use `set` instead of just leaving it. I'm assuming there is, because Dima changed it.

If `Pi.characters()` doesn't work, we need to either find a workaround (like sort by strings) or fix sorting.

See comments ticket:30801#comment:202 and following.

Sorting by string does obscure the example a bit
but makes doctests pass with minimal disruption.

The following avoids sorting by string
but is a more disruptive change:

```diff
        A more complicated example (higher weight and nontrivial central character)::

             sage: f = Newforms(GammaH(25, [6]), 3, names='j')[0]; f
             q + j0*q^2 + 1/3*j0^3*q^3 - 1/3*j0^2*q^4 + O(q^6)
             sage: Pi = LocalComponent(f, 5)
-            sage: set(Pi.characters())
-            {Character of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0), of level 1, mapping s |--> 1/3*j0^2*d - 1/3*j0^3, 5 |--> 5,
-             Character of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0), of level 1, mapping s |--> -1/3*j0^2*d, 5 |--> 5}
-            sage: Pi.characters()[0].base_ring()
-            Number Field in d with defining polynomial x^2 - j0*x + 1/3*j0^2 over its base field
+            sage: chars = Pi.characters()
+            sage: len(chars)
+            2
+            sage: a, b = chars
+            sage: a.galois_conjugate() == b
+            True
+            sage: C = a.parent()
+            sage: C
+            Group of smooth characters
+              of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0)
+              with values in Number Field in d
+              with defining polynomial x^2 - j0*x + 1/3*j0^2 over its base field
+            sage: d = a.base_ring().gen()
+            sage: s = C.number_field().gen()
+            sage: j0 = a.base_ring().relative_polynomial().base_ring().gen()
+            sage: a(5) == b(5) == 5
+            True
+            sage: {a(s), b(s)} == {(1/3*j0^2*d - 1/3*j0^3), (-1/3*j0^2*d)}
+            True
```
Another option would be to implement
a platform-independent sorting of characters.

What i am lookinkg for is whether there was an issue on a single computer when we use lists instead of sets (i could not find any evidence in the various discussions).

Replying to [comment:29 dimpase]:

Unfortunately, i currently do not have any 32bit builder.

Let us collect results of various builds on #32134.
