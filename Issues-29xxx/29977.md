Do you have some evidence that we have to sort the lists ? The problem with sorting is that examples are not easy to understand for users (usually not involved in doctesting).

Other than #30801#comment:206 I don't have any evidence.

`Pi.characters()` is stable on my machines. But `set(Pi.characters())` isn't. I'm asking you, whether there is a reason to use `set` instead of just leaving it. I'm assuming there is, because Dima changed it.

If `Pi.characters()` doesn't work, we need to either find a workaround (like sort by strings) or fix sorting.

See commentsticket: ticket:30801#comment:202#comment:30801 and following.

Sorting by string does obscure the example a bit
but makes doctests pass with minimal disruption.

The following avoids sorting by string
but is a more disruptive change:

```diff
        A more complicated example (higher weight and nontrivial central character)::

             sage: f = Newforms(GammaH(25, [6]), 3, names='j')[0]; f
             q + j0*q^2 + 1/3*j0^3*q^3 - 1/3*j0^2*q^4 + O(q^6)
             sage: Pi = LocalComponent(f, 5)
-            sage: set(Pi.characters())
-            {Character of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0), of level 1, mapping s |--> 1/3*j0^2*d - 1/3*j0^3, 5 |--> 5,
-             Character of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0), of level 1, mapping s |--> -1/3*j0^2*d, 5 |--> 5}
-            sage: Pi.characters()[0].base_ring()
-            Number Field in d with defining polynomial x^2 - j0*x + 1/3*j0^2 over its base field
+            sage: chars = Pi.characters()
+            sage: len(chars)
+            2
+            sage: a, b = chars
+            sage: a.galois_conjugate() == b
+            True
+            sage: C = a.parent()
+            sage: C
+            Group of smooth characters
+              of unramified extension Q_5(s)* (s^2 + 4*s + 2 = 0)
+              with values in Number Field in d
+              with defining polynomial x^2 - j0*x + 1/3*j0^2 over its base field
+            sage: d = a.base_ring().gen()
+            sage: s = C.number_field().gen()
+            sage: j0 = a.base_ring().relative_polynomial().base_ring().gen()
+            sage: a(5) == b(5) == 5
+            True
+            sage: {a(s), b(s)} == {(1/3*j0^2*d - 1/3*j0^3), (-1/3*j0^2*d)}
+            True
```
Another option would be to implement
a platform-independent sorting of characters.

is there a way to efficiently check that the characters in question are characters, and their set is exhaustive in some sense?  

anyhow the test for `len(chars)` above may be skipped.

I created #32134 for the `src/sage/modular/local_comp/local_comp.py` issue, as it is not related to the random seed (which is the purpose of this ticket).

My bet is that the order changed due to Pari upgrade, but it is constant for a given Pari version, hence we can use raw lists, not sets, nor sorting, nor cumbersome doctests.

Could you please try that branch, and see if it passes for all of you.

What i am lookinkg for is whether there was an issue on a single computer when we use lists instead of sets (i could not find any evidence in the various discussions).

Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A29):
> did you try 32-bit as well as 64 bit?


Unfortunately, i currently do not have any 32bit builder.

Let us collect results of various builds on #32134.
