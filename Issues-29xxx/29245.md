Debian fplll package is broken - fplll/pruner/ headers are missing.
So one gets 

```
[fpylll-0.5.1dev]     building 'fpylll.fplll.integer_matrix' extension
[fpylll-0.5.1dev]     creating build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/build/src/fpylll/fplll

```
I propose to include a check for this header in the macro.

In fact, fplll-5.2.1 does not have that header, they only appear in fplll-5.3

so, just updating the minimal version will do.
