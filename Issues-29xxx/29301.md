In addition, setting `SAGE_CHECK=warn` has the same effect.

This is useful for automated builds - using make -k `SAGE_CHECK=warn` we can collect many build and test suite results in one shot.

If you set `SAGE_CHECK=warn`, it doesn't behave just like passing the `-w` flag to `sage-spkg`: the latter sets `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES=x`, while the former does not. Therefore the default setting `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'` gets used with the former.

What is the intent?

(Aside: should flags like `-c` and now `-w` also have corresponding Makefile targets? We shouldn't have to set environment variables to do this.)

I set SAGE_CHECK=warn to enable this behavior as a default for all packages. I don't see why the default `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'` should not apply. In my test scripts, I set `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` to more exclusions (for example, ppl has a testsuite that takes very long.)

Makefile targets, I don't think. We could make it `configure` options though. (In some follow-up ticket.)

If `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` is not empty, then setting `SAGE_CHECK=warn` should not affect that.
