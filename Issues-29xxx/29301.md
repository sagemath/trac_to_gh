In addition, setting `SAGE_CHECK=warn` has the same effect.

This is useful for automated builds - using make -k `SAGE_CHECK=warn` we can collect many build and test suite results in one shot.

I set SAGE_CHECK=warn to enable this behavior as a default for all packages. I don't see why the default `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'` should not apply. In my test scripts, I set `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` to more exclusions (for example, ppl has a testsuite that takes very long.)

Makefile targets, I don't think. We could make it `configure` options though. (In some follow-up ticket.)

If `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` is not empty, then setting `SAGE_CHECK=warn` should not affect that.

Re Makefile targets vs. configure: it feels more standard to have `make check` or similar, rather than have it be a configure option. Not to be done on this ticket, either way.
