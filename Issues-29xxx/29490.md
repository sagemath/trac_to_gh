Follow-up from #29369: I see crashes in running doctests on `fedora-30-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/572856797), which uses system brial 1.2.5-1

```
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to abort
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring_constructor.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t src/sage/sat/solvers/dimacs.py  # Killed due to abort
```

We remove the spkg-configure for Sage 9.1.

A follow up ticket can restore and repair it for 9.2.

```
	
%build
	
export CPPFLAGS="-DPBORI_NDEBUG"
	
%configure --enable-shared --disable-static
	
# Get rid of undesirable hardcoded rpaths, and workaround libtool reordering
	
# -Wl,--as-needed after all the libraries.
	
sed -e 's|^hardcode_libdir_flag_spec=.*|hardcode_libdir_flag_spec=""|g' \
	
    -e 's|^runpath_var=LD_RUN_PATH|runpath_var=DIE_RPATH_DIE|g' \
	
    -e 's|CC="\(g..\)"|CC="\1 -Wl,--as-needed"|' \
	
    -i libtool
```

But I really have no clue.

no, apparently it is not the case, this patch is there.
I tried the following on Fedora 30 (brial 1.2.5)

```
#include <iostream>
#include <polybori/except/CErrorInfo.h>
int main () {
	polybori::CErrorInfo foo;
    std::cout << polybori::CTypes::last_error << "\n";
	std::cout << foo.text(-1) << "\n";
	return 1;
}

```
and it prints

```
clpc171[/tmp]$ g++ bri.cc -lbrial
clpc171[/tmp]$ ./a.out 
12
Unknown error occured.
```

no crash.
