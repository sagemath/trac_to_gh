This meta-ticket tracks a few tickets which would
improve compatibility with the Python library.

This would help Sage integrate better with the Python ecosystem.

Tickets regarding the Python library:

- #33676: add .bit_length() method to Integer
- #30121: py3: Adapt Sage's range-like functions
- #29137: Fix more uses of large Python ints
- #29006: Rational number constructor: handle leading '+'?
- #29033: Support minimal system Python version 3.6
- #28912: Function math.log10 fails on large Sage integers while ok on Python ints

- #28234: Sage numbers are incompatible with Python `Fraction`s and the `statistics` module
- #27788: Make Sage reals and rationals more friendly to Python string formatting
- #26311: py3: strange behavior of sleep() on Sage types
- #13811: Meta-ticket: `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` protocol
- #10365: `timedelta` doesn't recognize Sage integers
- #34385: Handle `collections.abc` classes when constructing enumerated sets

Tickets regarding other Python packages:

- #32477 Incompatibility with `dask`
