Possibly missed by #28057.   The method `omega()` for elliptic curve period lattices has a precision parameter `prec` which is correctly passed on to the function `real_period()` for real embeddings, but not to the function `complex_area()` for complex embeddings.

A one-line fix is needed (line 914 of period_lattice.py) which I will do and add a doctest.
