This is an experimental alternative proposal to #27824.

It isn't yet as "complete" as #27824 as it lacks some of the fixes (e.g. the patches to Pillow) which I didn't need for my tests, but which may still be needed on other platforms (TBD).

---

The spkg-configure.m4 itself is taken almost directly from #27824, as most of it was great, except for a couple minor changes:

* No temporary "config_venv" to test the system Python's packages; instead just run the system Python (if detected) with the `-S` flag.

* `config_setup.py` and `config_build` are renamed `conftest.py` and `conftest.dir` respectively since autoconf will automatically clean up files and directories beginning with "conftest"; see https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.60/autoconf.html#Guidelines

* `AC_SUBST([SAGE_SYSTEM_PYTHON])` instead of `AC_SUBST([PYTHON_FOR_VENV])`

---

The changes to `build/make/deps` are also inspired by #27824 but are simpler in my opinion: Instead of creating a virtualenv nested inside SAGE_LOCAL, SAGE_LOCAL itself is just treated as a virtualenv, and we install the necessary files for the Python interpreter to treat it as such, which keeps things simpler, as SAGE_LOCAL + `source sage-env` already fills the same purpose as a virtualenv.

---

The changes to `src/sage/env.py` are reworked just a little bit (in particular, the version in #27824 was buggy on Cygwin, as it would privilege system DLLs over DLLs in SAGE_LOCAL).

This was tested on Ubuntu 18.04, and `make ptestlong` passes from a clean build with the system Python detected.  No guarantees about OSX or other platforms.

Depends on #29357

Thanks for working of this. 
I have started to merge a few things from this branch.

One concern that I have is that in this approach, there is a `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/activate` which signals to users that it would "activate" `$SAGE_LOCAL`. But it doesn't. It only activates the venv.

Right, that's a bit confusing.  I wasn't totally sure how I felt about that variable name either, but I couldn't think of something better.

@embray
I have adopted the approach of using `venv.EnvBuilder` on `SAGE_LOCAL`  in #27824. Thanks for your work on it.
