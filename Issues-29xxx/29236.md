We implement arrays of fast_callable.
We use it when there is a need to consider
gradient or hessian of multidimensional functions
(typically `numerical/optimize.py`).

Such arrays should be compatible with
numpy arrays as with #29235.

**CC:**  @slel @orlitzky

**Status:** new

**Dependencies:** #29235
