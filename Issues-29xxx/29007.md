Is there a reason why one would call `_set_libgap` outside of the element constructor? I really don't see why that should not be `cdef`. Then you could remove the second type check and the `raise TypeError` case.

Also, `cdef UInt2 * p2` looks weird to me, like it should be multiplication. Instead, I would follow "correct" C format `cdef UInt2* p2` since it is a `UInt2` pointer or the less optimal (but also common) `cdef UInt2 *p2`.

I still do not see the point, but this is an improvement so I am not going to argue about it.

There are others that need to be changed.

> I found `int* p` is very bad when multiple declarations comes in such as `int* p, q`.


In this case, how I was told you should interpret `int*` is as the type "an int pointer." So it once you see it a bit and get used to it, I don't look bad IMO.

Which is a wrong interpretation as `int* p, q` does not declare `q` as a pointer.
