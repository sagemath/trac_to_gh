Is there a reason why one would call `_set_libgap` outside of the element constructor? I really don't see why that should not be `cdef`. Then you could remove the second type check and the `raise TypeError` case.

Also, `cdef UInt2 * p2` looks weird to me, like it should be multiplication. Instead, I would follow "correct" C format `cdef UInt2* p2` since it is a `UInt2` pointer or the less optimal (but also common) `cdef UInt2 *p2`.

I still do not see the point, but this is an improvement so I am not going to argue about it.

There are others that need to be changed.

In this case, how I was told you should interpret `int*` is as the type "an int pointer." So it once you see it a bit and get used to it, I don't look bad IMO.

Which is a wrong interpretation as `int* p, q` does not declare `q` as a pointer.

> Which is a wrong interpretation as `int* p, q` does not declare `q` as a pointer.

Hmm...so then what I saw then was wrong (well, suppose to be limited to a single variable declaration). I also did a bit more digging, and where the `*` goes depends on more on whether they are trained as a C or C++ programmer. Now that makes me think the `*` should go with the variable. Anyways, we can just leave it as is if you don't want to make the change. Either way you decide to do it, you can set a positive review.
