Sure, the program is attached. It reads multi_code. The format is very
easy and described in the attached txt file.

Feel free to use it in sage or in any other way where it can be useful.

Best wishes,

As mentioned in Professor Brinkmann's email message, the command-line version of the program reads `multi_code` input. This format is described in the documentation of `gconv` by Thomas Harmuth.

```
4) multi_code_old
   This code is binary. The first entry is the number of vertices.
   Vertices are numbered 1,...,n. To each vertex x there is a list of
   neighbours with higher numbers than x (like in reg_code_old), followed by a zero.
   The last list is always empty (no neighbours of n with a higher number than n),
   so the last "list" is not followed by a zero.
   After the last byte the next graph follows.
        ...
7) multi_code
   See 4), but with the header at the beginning. The header is one of the following:
   >>multi_code<<
   >>multi_code le<<
   >>multi_code be<<
   where "le/be" stands for little endian/big endian.
```

This PR puts the unaltered (but renamed) original source file into the `src/sage/graphs/` directory. It can be compiled for command-line use, by using the instructions at the start of the file.

Todo: 1. Implement an interface with sage. 2. Incorporate this into sage's `genus` method. I do not expect either of these to be difficult.
