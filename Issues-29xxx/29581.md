The current algorithm for characteristic forms is comparably slow. The worst case scenario showed computations times about 1h in dimension four.

With this ticket, we want to replace the current algorithm and implement characteristic cohomology classes as sub-ring of the de Rham cohomology ring (cf. #31691).

The idea is that characteristic (cohomology) classes are generated by Chern/Pontryagin/Euler classes. The generators can be computed by an Faddeev-LeVerrier-like algorithm (cf. #30681).

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
* do not use this:

```
if distinct_real == False
```
but

```
if not distinct_real
```
(at least in two places)


* The following change is wrong:

```diff
-        - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
-
+            - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
         OUTPUT:
 
-        - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
+            - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
```
as one should not indent inside INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (because they end with only one colon). And moreover, one does want empty lines to separate these things.

This is also incorrect:

```diff
-            self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
+                self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
```
Why did you change the indentation ? it was ok.

<a id='comment:23'>**Comment 23:**</a>
Do you think it is necessary to give those cohomology classes an own parent or would `DeRhamCohomologyRing` as parent suffice?

The point is that addition and multiplication is performed differently among those elements. Moreover, it is possible to compare them.

You would have to know that ahead of time I think. Naïvely, it seems like you need to know the answer before you can tell if the answer is the form you want.

Mh okay. If you like, we can talk about it privately at some point.

I have another question though. I tried to establish a coercion from the characteristic cohomology class ring to the de Rham cohomology ring. For that, I need a representative which I only get if I've inserted a connection. Now I've read that coercions must always suceed. So throwing an error if no representative is available is not an option then?

Otherwise, we could return the same instance of `CharacteristicCohomologyClass` if we pass it to the `_element_constructor_` of `DeRhamCohomologyRing`. But I suppose that is against the coercion principles either, right?

If you are still stuck with something, perhaps we can. Perhaps Éric can offer some wisdom here.

> I have another question though. I tried to establish a coercion from the characteristic cohomology class ring to the de Rham cohomology ring. For that, I need a representative which I only get if I've inserted a connection. Now I've read that coercions must always suceed.

Probably. Although you can say there is a coercion, but the data used to initialize it has not been specified. However, this map must also be unique too (in a mathematical sense; I think different representatives for the same element is fine), which means you cannot change the connection. This might be a place where we can justify having an exception because of the surrounding framework, but it is likely better to avoid that and make the user explicitly ask for a conversion.

If we are passing it to the `_element_cosntructor_`, then it is a conversion, and there are essentially no rules at that point.

Thank you Travis for your comments. My original idea was to inherit from `DeRhamCohomologyClass`. Because both classes have the `representative` method in common, which is crucial to perform operations such as additions and cup-products. My "dream" would be that an element of `CharacteristicCohomologyClassRing` can be seen as member of `DeRhamCohomologyRing`, and whenever `representative` is invoked (even after coercions), you can still choose a connection.

One way to achieve this could be to allow the attribute `_representative` in `DeRhamCohomologyClass` to refer to a method. But I suppose this is rather spurious for the user?

Alternatively, if we drop my "dream" and still allow coercion: we can modify `DeRhamCohomologyClass` in such a way that we can give it a name and allow to leave the `_representative` attribute empty. Similar to scalar fields whose expressions are not set yet. Afterwards, the representative can be set dynamically, and we can make the instance immutable if desired.

What would you prefer Travis? Eric, do you have an opinion, too?

Since `CharacteristicCohomologyClass` is not a function nor user-facing, you should follow Python naming conventions and write it as `characteristic_cohomology_class`, perhaps adding `build_` in front. However, I think you are better off tying that to the ring, perhaps as a (cached) helper method. This ties the cache of classes to the lifecycle of the ring rather than globally (which also nails the rings in memory) and better links everything from a code-association perspective.

This isn't necessarily specific to this ticket (but maybe now with these changes this is now possible), but do we have an example where the entire cohomology ring of a manifold is computed, such as the sphere or torus?

Perhaps as a followup ticket, a thematic tutorial on how to compute with the cohomology classes of the manifold might be good (using the module-level doc as a starting point).

Perhaps that is a bit special. The torus is a little more interesting example. Mainly what I am thinking is if can we compute the Betti numbers without necessarily knowing what the manifold is in advance.

For once, the characteristic cohomology classes in general don't generate the cohomology groups. Moreover, if a characteristic cohomology class has torsion in the ZZ-cohomology, its corresponding class in the de Rham cohomology vanishes. So you lose a lot of information on the way.

Okay. Thank you for the explanation.

I agree that it should be a followup. Yet, it is a bit specialized, so I think a thematic tutorial is better.

`sage: import_statements("I")` says

```
from sage.rings.imaginary_unit import I
```
Indeed:

```
sage: from sage.rings.imaginary_unit import I as I2
sage: I2 is I
True
```

BTW, I've just noticed that

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.constants import I as I3
sage: I3 is I
False
```
However, 

```
sage: bool(I3 == I)
True
sage: I3^2
-1
sage: I + I3
2*I
```

In `src/sage/symbolic/all.py` there is a deprecation warning against `from sage.symbolic.expression import I`:

```
lazy_import("sage.symbolic.expression", "I", deprecation=(18036,
        "import I from sage.symbolic.constants for the imaginary unit viewed as an element of SR, or from sage.rings.imaginary_unit for the element of ZZ[i]"))
```
However, this warning does not seem effective...
