The current algorithm for characteristic forms is comparably slow. The worst case scenario showed computations times about 1h in dimension four.

With this ticket, we want to replace the current algorithm and implement characteristic cohomology classes as sub-ring of the de Rham cohomology ring (cf. #31691).

The idea is that characteristic (cohomology) classes are generated by Chern/Pontryagin/Euler classes. The generators can be computed by an Faddeev-LeVerrier-like algorithm (cf. #30681).

* The following change is wrong:

```diff
-        - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
-
+            - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
         OUTPUT:
 
-        - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
+            - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
```
as one should not indent inside INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (because they end with only one colon). And moreover, one does want empty lines to separate these things.

This is also incorrect:

```diff
-            self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
+                self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
```
Why did you change the indentation ? it was ok.

You would have to know that ahead of time I think. Naïvely, it seems like you need to know the answer before you can tell if the answer is the form you want.

Mh okay. If you like, we can talk about it privately at some point.

I have another question though. I tried to establish a coercion from the characteristic cohomology class ring to the de Rham cohomology ring. For that, I need a representative which I only get if I've inserted a connection. Now I've read that coercions must always suceed. So throwing an error if no representative is available is not an option then?

Otherwise, we could return the same instance of `CharacteristicCohomologyClass` if we pass it to the `_element_constructor_` of `DeRhamCohomologyRing`. But I suppose that is against the coercion principles either, right?

If you are still stuck with something, perhaps we can. Perhaps Éric can offer some wisdom here.

If we are passing it to the `_element_cosntructor_`, then it is a conversion, and there are essentially no rules at that point.

Thank you Travis for this feedback. I also tied it to the element constructor now. Is that what you had in mind?

Take for example `CP^1 = S^2` whose 2nd cohomology is generated by the first Chern class of the tautological bundle. But this is a rather special example.

Perhaps that is a bit special. The torus is a little more interesting example. Mainly what I am thinking is if can we compute the Betti numbers without necessarily knowing what the manifold is in advance.

Right. But this is indeed something for a follow-up. However, don't you think this fits better into a general tutorial?

I agree that it should be a followup. Yet, it is a bit specialized, so I think a thematic tutorial is better.

BTW, I've just noticed that

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.constants import I as I3
sage: I3 is I
False
```
However, 

```
sage: bool(I3 == I)

sage: I3^2

sage: I + I3

<a id='comment:0'></a>To summarize, there are at least 3 sources for `I`: `sage.rings.imaginary_unit`, `sage.symbolic.constants`, `sage.symbolic.expression`, but only the first one gives the same `I` as the Python variable predefined in the interactive shell. Moreover, we have

```
sage: I.parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I
sage: from sage.symbolic.constants import I as I1
sage: I1.parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression import I as I2
sage: I2.parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: I2 is I1
True
```

In `src/sage/symbolic/all.py` there is a deprecation warning against `from sage.symbolic.expression import I`:

```
lazy_import("sage.symbolic.expression", "I", deprecation=(18036,
        "import I from sage.symbolic.constants for the imaginary unit viewed as an element of SR, or from sage.rings.imaginary_unit for the element of ZZ[i]"))
```
However, this warning does not seem effective...
