The current algorithm for characteristic forms is comparably slow. The worst case scenario showed computations times about 1h in dimension four.

With this ticket, we want to replace the current algorithm and implement characteristic cohomology classes as sub-ring of the de Rham cohomology ring (cf. #31691).

The idea is that characteristic (cohomology) classes are generated by Chern/Pontryagin/Euler classes. The generators can be computed by an Faddeev-LeVerrier-like algorithm (cf. #30681).

* do not use this:

```
if distinct_real == False
```
but

```
if not distinct_real
```
(at least in two places)


* The following change is wrong:

```diff
-        - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
-
+            - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
         OUTPUT:
 
-        - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
+            - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
```
as one should not indent inside INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (because they end with only one colon). And moreover, one does want empty lines to separate these things.

This is also incorrect:

```diff
-            self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
+                self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
```
Why did you change the indentation ? it was ok.

The point is that addition and multiplication is performed differently among those elements. Moreover, it is possible to compare them.

I am particularly curious what you think about my last commit. I want that the corresponding characteristic forms are only computed if really necessary. This essentially only matters for the Pontryagin-Euler algorithm when the characteristic cohomology class contains no Euler or Pontryagin part.

Is there any lazy-stuff to make this a bit nicer maybe?

You would have to know that ahead of time I think. Naïvely, it seems like you need to know the answer before you can tell if the answer is the form you want.

Mh okay. If you like, we can talk about it privately at some point.

I have another question though. I tried to establish a coercion from the characteristic cohomology class ring to the de Rham cohomology ring.

If you are still stuck with something, perhaps we can. Perhaps Éric can offer some wisdom here.

If we are passing it to the `_element_cosntructor_`, then it is a conversion, and there are essentially no rules at that point.

This isn't necessarily specific to this ticket (but maybe now with these changes this is now possible), but do we have an example where the entire cohomology ring of a manifold is computed, such as the sphere or torus?

Perhaps as a followup ticket, a thematic tutorial on how to compute with the cohomology classes of the manifold might be good (using the module-level doc as a starting point).

Take for example `CP^1 = S^2` whose 2nd cohomology is generated by the first Chern class of the tautological bundle. But this is a rather special example.

module-level doc?

Perhaps that is a bit special. The torus is a little more interesting example. Mainly what I am thinking is if can we compute the Betti numbers without necessarily knowing what the manifold is in advance.

`sage: import_statements("I")` says

```
from sage.rings.imaginary_unit import I
```
Indeed:

```
sage: from sage.rings.imaginary_unit import I as I2
sage: I2 is I
True
```

BTW, I've just noticed that

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.constants import I as I3
sage: I3 is I

However, 

```
sage: bool(I3 == I)

In `src/sage/symbolic/all.py` there is a deprecation warning against `from sage.symbolic.expression import I`:

```
lazy_import("sage.symbolic.expression", "I", deprecation=(18036,
        "import I from sage.symbolic.constants for the imaginary unit viewed as an element of SR, or from sage.rings.imaginary_unit for the element of ZZ[i]"))
```
However, this warning does not seem effective...
