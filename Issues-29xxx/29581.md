The current algorithm for characteristic forms is comparably slow. The worst case scenario showed computations times about 1h in dimension four.

With this ticket, we want to replace the current algorithm and implement characteristic cohomology classes as sub-ring of the de Rham cohomology ring (cf. #31691).

The idea is that characteristic (cohomology) classes are generated by Chern/Pontryagin/Euler classes. The generators can be computed by an Faddeev-LeVerrier-like algorithm (cf. #30681).

<a id='comment:9'></a>* do not use this:

```

but

```
if not distinct_real
```
(at least in two places)


* The following change is wrong:

```diff
-        - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
-
+            - ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
         OUTPUT:
 
-        - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
+            - ``I/(2*pi)*cmatrix``
```
as one should not indent inside INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (because they end with only one colon). And moreover, one does want empty lines to separate these things.

This is also incorrect:

```diff
-            self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
+                self._dual_exterior_powers[p] = ExtPowerDualFreeModule(self, p)
```
Why did you change the indentation ? it was ok.

Mh okay. If you like, we can talk about it privately at some point.

I have another question though. I tried to establish a coercion from the characteristic cohomology class ring to the de Rham cohomology ring. For that, I need a representative which I only get if I've inserted a connection. Now I've read that coercions must always suceed. So throwing an error if no representative is available is not an option then?

If you are still stuck with something, perhaps we can. Perhaps Éric can offer some wisdom here.

If we are passing it to the `_element_cosntructor_`, then it is a conversion, and there are essentially no rules at that point.

Perhaps as a followup ticket, a thematic tutorial on how to compute with the cohomology classes of the manifold might be good (using the module-level doc as a starting point).

Perhaps that is a bit special. The torus is a little more interesting example. Mainly what I am thinking is if can we compute the Betti numbers without necessarily knowing what the manifold is in advance.

I agree that it should be a followup. Yet, it is a bit specialized, so I think a thematic tutorial is better.

BTW, I've just noticed that

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.constants import I as I3
sage: I3 is I
False
```
However, 

```
sage: bool(I3 == I)
True
sage: I3^2

sage: I + I3
2*I

In `src/sage/symbolic/all.py` there is a deprecation warning against `from sage.symbolic.expression import I`:

```
lazy_import("sage.symbolic.expression", "I", deprecation=(18036,
        "import I from sage.symbolic.constants for the imaginary unit viewed as an element of SR, or from sage.rings.imaginary_unit for the element of ZZ[i]"))
```
However, this warning does not seem effective...
