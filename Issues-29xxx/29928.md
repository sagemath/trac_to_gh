This ticket implements the action of differential operators (from the Weyl algebra) on polynomials:

```
sage: W.<x,y> = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(QQ)
sage: dx, dy = W.differentials()
sage: dx.diff(x^3)
3*x^2
sage: (x*dx + dy + 1).diff(x^4*y^4 + 1)
5*x^4*y^4 + 4*x^4*y^3 + 1
```

However, it would be nice to overload some operator so we don't have to write `f.diff(g)`. Maybe a shift operator `>>` or `<<` would be good? Or the `&` operator?",
