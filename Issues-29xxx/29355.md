In previous tickets we have moved sage-the-distribution scripts out of `src/bin`.

Some scripts that are (correctly) located in `src/bin` use `sage-system-python`, which is in `build/bin` and not installed and not available in distributions.

```
src/bin/sage-coverage:1:#!/usr/bin/env sage-system-python
src/bin/sage-pypkg-location:1:#!/usr/bin/env sage-system-python
src/bin/sage-coverageall:1:#!/usr/bin/env sage-system-python
src/bin/sage-num-threads.py:1:#!/usr/bin/env sage-system-python
```

We change `sage-coverage*` to just use `python3`. If Sage's venv is in the front of the PATH, this is Sage's python. But these scripts work with "any python3", it does not have to be the one in which sage is installed.

We remove `src/bin/sage-pypkg-location`, which is undocumented and unused.

We move `src/bin/sage-num-threads.py` to `build/bin/sage-build-num-threads` (where it keeps using `sage-system-python`), leaving a much simplified version `src/bin/sage-num-threads.py` (which is using `python3`) behind.

#29951 will only put `$SAGE_ROOT/bin` in `$PATH` if `$SAGE_ROOT` is set and readable.

Repurposing this ticket to change scripts in `src/bin` to not use `sage-system-python` (which is in `build/bin` and not installed and not available in distributions).

I was currently checking it also. So, I confirm that `sage -coverage` and `sage -coverageall` still work. Also, `sage-num-threads.py` still seems to work:

```
(sage-sh) $ echo $SAGE_NUM_THREADS
1
(sage-sh) $ echo $SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL
8
```

or the above were defined from `build/make/install`?

Anyway, I have:

```
sage: import os                                                                 
sage: os.environ['SAGE_NUM_THREADS']                                            
'1'
sage: os.environ['SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL']                                   
'8'
```

positive review!
