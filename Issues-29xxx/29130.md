<a id='comment:5'></a>Regarding the package equivalents: All packages sage needs should be listed at the start of one of those files:

- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/env-locations.nix
- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/sagedoc.nix

One caveat is that if you want to use system python packages, you either need to add them to PYTHONPATH manually or install them as a single python environment. That means instead of installing
`python3`, `numpy`, `scipy`
separately, you'd install the "package" (or environment) `python3.withPackages (ps: with ps; [numpy scipy])`.

I'm happy to help by explaining things, though I won't take the lead on this for now since sage-the-distribution isn't high priority for me right now (I have my hands full keeping the nix package running).

`libgd` fails to install, which is somewhat unfortunate as we could simply add the package `freetype` to the system, couldn't we?
