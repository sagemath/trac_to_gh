This ticket keeps track of any capabilities that were
in SageNb that for whatever reason are not in Jupyter.
Note that it is a metaticket, and not all tickets from
it may end up being resolved.  If you open a ticket for
one of these, please add the link in the description.

See #25837 for a list and background, as well as [this wiki page](https://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook).
