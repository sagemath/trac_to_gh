 No ticket yet:
 
 * Missing TinyMCE or other rich text editor (see [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25837#comment:44))
 * jsmol menu doesn't seem to work (see [this upstream](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1872) and [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25837#comment:45)) so exporting images is difficult (see however [comment:3](#comment:3))
 * Very long output not suppressed well
-* Revive graph editor (notice CoCalc has an interesting graph output)
