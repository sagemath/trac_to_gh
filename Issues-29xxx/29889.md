This ticket keeps track of any capabilities that were
in SageNb that for whatever reason are not in Jupyter.
Note that it is a metaticket, and not all tickets from
it may end up being resolved.  If you open a ticket for
one of these, please add the link in the description.

+* #30540: Provide graph editor that works with Jupyter
 
 No ticket yet:
 
 * Missing TinyMCE or other rich text editor (see [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25837#comment:44))
 * jsmol menu doesn't seem to work (see [this upstream](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1872) and [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25837#comment:45)) so exporting images is difficult (see however [comment:3](#comment%3A3))
 * Very long output not suppressed well
-* Revive graph editor (notice CoCalc has an interesting graph output)
