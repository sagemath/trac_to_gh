The change to the template avoids a console warning that is new for this version.

The other console warning about OrbitControls cannot be removed because it represents a major change to the Three.js library that will take some effort to work around, but that does not need to be addressed until the beginning of next year.

Upgraded library is in attachments to this ticket.

Something like this, adapted :

The upstream zip file includes the entire project. We are only using a small fraction of it.

Please forgive my ignorance of the process of updating a sage package, but I ran into build errors due to the zip file not existing on the mirrors (like the patch bot is currently reporting). Is this expected until the ticket gets merged or some other step is taken to sync them up? I was able to get it to build correctly by manually moving the zip into the `upstream/` directory.

I verified that the two files within the zip (`three.min.js` and `OrbitControls.js`) are indeed from the r117 release and that the listed checksums match. 

I had a collection of Jupyter notebooks on hand from prior work containing all of the examples in the plot3d reference documentation, so I did a quick side-by-side comparison with the old and new Three.js versions. I didn't observe any visual discrepancies, and the camera controls function the same as before. 

I also noticed the new console warning regarding `OrbitControls.js` as expected.

Was the other console warning you mentioned due to Three.js expecting a boolean value but  `json.useFlatShading` being null/undefined? I think `!!json.useFlatShading` would also work to coerce it to be boolean, but that's a minor nitpick.
