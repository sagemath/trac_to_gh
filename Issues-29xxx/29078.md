We move the methods `is_simple` and `is_simplicial` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

This is slighly slower as `CombinatorialPolyhedron` needs to be initialized, but most of the labor (calculating the incidence matrix) needs to be done either way.

Once `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is initialized this is faster.
