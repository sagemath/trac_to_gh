The new dilation with #29200 discovered two bugs:

```
sage: 2*Polyhedron([[]], backend='cdd')
...
TypeError ...
```

and

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: sqrt2*Polyhedron(backend='normaliz')
...
AttributeError
```

The underlying errors are the following:

```
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.backend_cdd import Polyhedron_QQ_cdd
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent import Polyhedra_QQ_cdd
sage: parent = Polyhedra_QQ_cdd(QQ, 0, 'cdd')
sage: p = Polyhedron_QQ_cdd(parent, [iter([]), iter([]), iter([])], None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'NoneType'

sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[], ambient_dim=5, backend='cdd')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'NoneType' and 'int'

sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent import Polyhedra_RDF_cdd
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.backend_cdd import Polyhedron_RDF_cdd
sage: parent = Polyhedra_RDF_cdd(RDF, 1, 'cdd')
sage: Vrep = [[], [], [[1.0]]]
sage: Hrep = [[], []]
sage: p = Polyhedron_RDF_cdd(parent, Vrep, Hrep,
....:                        Vrep_minimal=True, Hrep_minimal=True) 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

There are two tiny fixes to it:
- Make sure to special-case the empty polyhedron in `Polyhedron_base.__init__`.
- Add a trivial inequality for initialization of the universe polyhedron with backend `cdd`.

We add doctests for each fix. Note that #29907 will also indirectly test this.

What also doesn't work for `cdd` and this is how the `TestSuite` detected the problem is `2*Polyhedron(backend='cdd')`. The problem is that it tries to discover the action via

`parent(Polyhedron(backend='cdd')).an_element()`, which is `Polyhedron([[]], backend='cdd')`.
