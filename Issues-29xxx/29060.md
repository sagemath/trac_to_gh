This is part of #29053, for debian/fedora/arch/conda (with follow-up tickets #29105, #29106 for other platforms).\n\n2. We generate well-defined test environments in the form of `Dockerfile`s. This makes it possible to test, on one's development computer, the correct installation of sage-the-distribution on a variety of platforms and configurations. #29053 provides `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` that generates the `Dockerfile` using the information in 1. The `minimal` configuration has just the packages that are needed for a build to succeed. The `standard` configuration installs all distribution packages that sage knows how to use.\n\n3. Running tests on many test environments is automated using `tox` in #29053. The top-level [tox.ini](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/tox.ini?id=23c6334cf2927a4d917a27b3963471e8242d86a3) file defines the test environments. Using `tox`'s factor conditions (https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#complex-factor-conditions), there is a succinct description of many test environments. For example, we can run `tox -e docker-debian-stretch-minimal,docker-arch-latest-standard`.\n\n4. #29087 automates running the `tox` tests for a selection of 34 platforms/configurations using a [GitHub](GitHub) Actions workflow on every `git push` to a [GitHub](GitHub) repository.

Testing of source and binary distributions relies too much on manual testing by people.

We propose to set up Dockerfiles and CI scripts that document and test the expected capabilities of source and binary Sage distributions; and of downstream distribution packaging.

**Testing of source trees and source distributions:** (in progress) 

With the important changes brought by #27330 (Meta-ticket: `spkg-configure`: Try to use as many system packages as possible), sage-the-distribution has become less monolithic; it now interacts in a more complex way with distribution packaging. We propose to add infrastructure for testing correct installation of sage source distributions on a variety of platforms. 

1. We collect information about distribution packages systematically and store it in on a per-SPKG basis in  `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/`. (Right now this information is scattered - in downstream sage distribution packagers' build scripts, trac tickets, replies to bug reports in google groups, the sage installation manual, personal knowledge...) This is part of #29053, for debian/fedora/arch/conda (with follow-up tickets #29105, #29106 for other platforms).

2. We generate well-defined test environments in the form of `Dockerfile`s. This makes it possible to test, on one's development computer, the correct installation of sage-the-distribution on a variety of platforms and configurations. #29053 provides `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` that generates the `Dockerfile` using the information in 1. The `minimal` configuration has just the packages that are needed for a build to succeed. The `standard` configuration installs all distribution packages that sage knows how to use.

3. Running tests on many test environments is automated using `tox` in #29053. The top-level [tox.ini](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/tox.ini?id=23c6334cf2927a4d917a27b3963471e8242d86a3) file defines the test environments. Using `tox`'s factor conditions (https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#complex-factor-conditions), there is a succinct description of many test environments. For example, we can run `tox -e docker-debian-stretch-minimal,docker-arch-latest-standard`.

4. #29087 automates running the `tox` tests for a selection of 34 platforms/configurations using a [GitHub](GitHub) Actions workflow on every `git push` to a [GitHub](GitHub) repository. An example run: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/32812271

Related meta-tickets:
- #29146: Meta-ticket: Refactor/improve system package related scripts, `tox.ini`, `build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh`
- #33338 Meta-ticket: CI workflows for upstream projects using Sage reusable workflows
- #32074 Meta-ticket: Remove support for outdated distros

Ideas without tickets so far:
- Testing that it is possible to build without error when upgrading with git from some list of previous releases.
- Test that packages can be cleanly uninstalled

---

**Testing of the sage binary distributions:** moved to #31133

---

**Testing of downstream packaging of sage:** (planning stage)

- #29111: Specify a subset of sage command line options that are supported by sagelib - rather than sage-the-distribution. Test that `sage -c SAGECOMMAND`, `sage -t`, `sage -python -c COMMAND`, ... work with the `sage` script provided by the distribution (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/BmkxIBdwbvE/fRMl2sjdBQAJ)
- #33671 Add `devcontainer.json` for development with VS Code in a Docker container

---

Symptoms:
- #29055: Installing any optional package on the binary distribution triggers full recompile of sagelib
- #29051: Paths configured in installed numpy site.cfg [DEFAULT/ALL] do not affect scipy

Yes, that would be nice. But it would already help if this were run at the time that betas and releases are prepared. I don't think it needs to be run on every ticket.
