So the calculation of eigenvalues of a matrix works like it should, with the command, matrix.eigenvalues()
. Sometimes the answers can be approximated instead of ending abruptly with symbols like in the below case

```
A = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
```

```
A.eigenvalues()
```
-0.3722813232690144?, 5.372281323269015?
were the answers
I think we can optimise the code for better approximation, taking into consideration what should be the most apt values.

Are you suggesting to increase the accuracy of the approximation of the eigenvalues? In this example, the eigenvalues are actually represented as algebraic numbers, so they are represented exactly, not approximately:

```
sage: a, b = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]).eigenvalues()
sage: a.parent()
Algebraic Field
```
Hence, you can ask for as many digits as you like:

```
sage: a.numerical_approx(digits=200)
-0.37228132326901432992530573410946465911013222899139618384993873528295036072870231351356268279839406120977873847282541893496741130760170170080926600978115388636398900830295790329685698714802834461041965
```
The eigenvalue is formally represented as a root of this polynomial:

```
sage: a.minpoly()
x^2 - 5*x - 2
```
In this case, the number can also be represented exactly using radicals:

```
sage: a.radical_expression()
-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2
```

The meaning of the question mark symbols in `-0.3722813232690144?` is that the decimal digits of this number are correct, except for possibly the last digit which may differ by Â±1. And indeed, as computed above, the correct last digit in this representation would be a 3 instead of a 4. This output format is the one of elements of the [Real Interval Field](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_mpfi.html), which is chosen for algebraic numbers, since a radical expression does not always exist.
