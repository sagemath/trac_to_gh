This is a meta ticket for the following GSoC 2020 project by Stefan Grosser, mentored by Travis Scrimshaw.
[Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11r5f2TlPnN4g0jzTXgHz2EZgWkTQT0_XsvGPd_HTy-o/edit?usp=sharing)

The goal will be to add multiple classes to FinitePoset such as d-complete, tree, and mobile, where all of these families have individual interest. Specifically, all of these classes permit efficient computation of the number of linear extensions. 

Three main tickets were worked on:
#28237
#29686
#30220

In 28237, I wrapped up the implementation of Atkinson's algorithm, used to compute the number of linear extensions of Tree posets. This tied in for the `LinearExtensionsOfForest` class created.
In 29686, I worked on implenting the forest posets and d-complete posets, along with their linear extensions.
Finally in 30220, I worked on the implementation of mobile posets and the counting of their linear extensions. Additionally, I made several example posets (seen in #30273)
