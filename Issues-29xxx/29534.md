Keywords: ci, ContinuousIntegration

1. If a developers wants to run the standard set of CI tests, just pushing a tag is a simpler interface than creating a pull request:  `git tag -f "ci" && git push --force github "ci"`

2. Also this ensures that releases always trigger a CI test.

Follow-up (wishlist): #29535 Customize CI workflows on GitHub Actions using specially structured tag names

This is a bit strange. My (shallow) understanding of tags is that they are kind of immutable branches.
Once a commit is tagged, the tag stays there.
Does pushing the same commit (as a part of another branch, say) trigger CI?

```

The CI workflow is triggered only by pushes to tags, not branches. 
Pushing the same tag to the same commit is a no-op and will probably not trigger the workflow.
If you want to restart a check of the same commit, just push a different tag.
