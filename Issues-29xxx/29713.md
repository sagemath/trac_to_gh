Let consider following code:

```
F = FunctionField(QQ, 'a')
a = F.gen()

polynomial_ring = PolynomialRing(F, 'x')
FF = FractionField(polynomial_ring)

element = F(-1/2/(a^2 + a))

assert F(FF(element))
```

The last line yields following error:

```
>           raise TypeError("fraction must have unit denominator")
E           TypeError: fraction must have unit denominator

/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/rings/fraction_field.py:1190: TypeError
```

But actually it should be just conversion from FractionField element back to Field.

P.S. There is also one more thing:

```
assert FF(element) in F
```

yields following:

```
E       assert -1/2/(a^2 + a) in Rational function field in a over Rational Field
E        +  where -1/2/(a^2 + a) = Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational function field in a over Rational Field(-1/2/(a^2 + a))
```

I feel like the right solution is to have FractionFieldEmbeddingSection._call_ raise a `ValueError` instead of a `TypeError`. From the code in fraction_field.py:

```
     # This should probably be a ValueError.
     # However, too much existing code is expecting this to throw a
     # TypeError, so we decided to keep it for the time being.
     raise TypeError("fraction must have unit denominator")
```
I did not have the courage to change this, so I implemented a hack in `RationalFunctionField._element_constructor`_that fixes this issue at least.

I think this is a pretty bad hack and it doesn't solve the underlying problem:

```
sage: F = FractionField(QQ['a'])
sage: a = F.gen()
sage: R = PolynomialRing(F, 'x')
sage: FF = FractionField(R)
sage: elt = F(-1/2/(a^2+a))
sage: FF(elt)
-1/2/(a^2 + a)
sage: F(_)  # Same error
```
I think the correct fix would be to change something in the fraction field `_element_constructor_` to handle this case.
