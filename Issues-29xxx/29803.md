Big upgrade steps, enabled by drop python 2 support.

* https://pypi.org/project/pip/   20.1.1
* https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/  47.1.1
* https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/  4.1.2

Add new packages to satisfy dependencies:

* https://pypi.org/project/wheel/ 0.34.2

These are the latest versions as of 2020-06-05; all claim to support Python >= 3.5 (note #29033)

We adjust `spkg-install` of several packages by removing `pyproject.toml` to remove the need for more extensive build infrastructure. We disable the build of `zope_interface` (no longer needed, see #29754).

Tarballs: See checksums.ini [upstream_url]. (To configure Sage to download from the upstream URL, use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`.)

Previous updates: #26969, #27886, #26008
