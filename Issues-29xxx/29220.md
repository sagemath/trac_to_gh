As reported on [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/PcfHbt8pi2s)

```
sage: a = AA(2**(1/2) - 2**(1/3))
sage: b = 808620184/5240825825
sage: a < b
True
sage: a < b
False
```
The problem comes from the fact that the `richcmp` function (from `sage.structure.richcmp`) makes a coercion of its arguments. But in the above situation, we are ultimately comparing two real intervals with different precisions. Here is a minimal example that is at the heart of the problem

```
sage: from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp, op_LT, op_GT
sage: R1 = RealIntervalField(2)
sage: R2 = RealIntervalField(4)
sage: r1 = R1(1, 3/2)
sage: r2 = R2(7/4, 15/8)
sage: r1.overlaps(r2)
False
sage: richcmp(r1, r2, op_LT)
False
sage: richcmp(r1, r2, op_GT)
False
```

I would not say that it is more consistent. It depends on the history of comparisons done before:


```
sage: a = AA(2**(1/2) - 2**(1/3))
sage: b = 808620184/5240825825
sage: a < b
True
sage: a < b
False
sage: a < b
False
sage: b = AA(b)
sage: b < a
False
sage: b > a
False
sage: b == a
False
```

 The problem comes from the fact that the `richcmp` function (from `sage.structure.richcmp`) makes a coercion of its arguments. But in the above situation, we are ultimately comparing two real intervals with different precisions. Here is a minimal example that is at the heart of the problem
 
 ```
+sage: from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp, op_LT, op_GT
 sage: R1 = RealIntervalField(2)
 sage: R2 = RealIntervalField(4)
 sage: r1 = R1(1, 3/2)

BTW, real interval fields are unreliable in the following scenario

```
sage: R1 = RealIntervalField(2)
sage: R2 = RealIntervalField(4)
sage: r1 = R1(1, 3/2)
sage: r2 = R2(7/4, 15/8)
sage: r1.overlaps(r2)
False
sage: r1 < r2
False
sage: r2 < r1
False
```
The problem is the implementation of `__richcmp__` which relies on the generic `richcmp` which performs coercion of the arguments. I think real intervals deserve a proper comparison implementation bypassing coercion.
