Goal: remove all the code of the graph module that has a deprecation warning referring to a ticket closed for at least one year.
These tickets are:
- #26200 deprecate import of all_max_clique, max_clique and clique_number in global namespace
- #27491 deprecate parameter copy in networkx_graph 
- #19227 Graphs: DFS and broken distance-parameter 
- #19517 Graphs: canonical_label() and several errors
- #25864 make LinearExtensions an iterator 

Note that the current ticket completely deletes the file `graphs/linearextensions.py`.

Keywords: **deprecation**
