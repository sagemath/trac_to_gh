LGTM modulo making the docstring `r"""` since you have some latex code `\dots` (which I always like the more explicit `\cdots` so there is never any ambiguity). Once this is fixed, you can set a positive review.

In the long run, it probably would be good to subclass the continued fraction object, but this is a good first step.
