Follow-up from #29305 (Repair cython_aliases ARB_LIBRARY). 

Build failures from https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/58605339 as reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eMQIlhglN98/bTwDGD9HBQAJ
for `ubuntu-eoan-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/518106133), `debian-buster-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/518106202).

Need to make sure that `sage_conf` is installed - #29287 takes care of this
