As a follow-up to #29411, we set up a separate directory `build/pkgs/sagelib/src` with symlinks into `SAGE_ROOT/src` so that sagelib's `setup.py` does not have access to the whole tree `SAGE_ROOT/src`.

We fix `setup.py sdist`, which can be tested using `spkg-src` (which builds a pip-installable tarball in `upstream/`) and `tox`:

```
./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v)'
./sage -sh -c 'build/pkgs/sagelib/src/.tox/python/bin/sage-ipython'
```

The call of `./sage -sh` is necessary so that `SAGE_LOCAL` is set. 
Moreover, for scripts that use `sage-env`, also `SAGE_ENV_SOURCED` is crucial for the correct operation; otherwise `sage-env` sets things based on `SAGE_LOCAL` again.
