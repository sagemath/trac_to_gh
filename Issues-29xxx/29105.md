```
As a followup to #29053 and #29273, we
- extend `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` to generate a Dockerfile using https://hub.docker.com/r/sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4
- add `build/pkgs/gentoo*.txt`
- extend `bin/sage-print-system-package-command` to handle gentoo
- add gentoo to the platforms tested in [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) CI.

To test: `tox -e docker-gentoo-standard`

This is a part of:
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

Creating a dockerfile for setting up sage prerequisites on a Gentoo "prefix" was previously discussed in #28905.

An attempt (incomplete) is at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket28905/Dockerfile-sage_gentoo.gz and would need help from Gentoo experts.

OK... this is where I got now. The `./bootstrap-prefix.sh` script was claiming to bootstrap some packages - such as xz and patch - and succeeded with that; but then it was missing "xz" to unpack the Python sources. I think something is wrong there, but I added xz&patch in ubuntu. This is attached Dockerfile-sage_gentoo and log from 'docker build' with that. 

As you can see in the log, now it's complaining about a module missing in the Python that it just built:

```

    from pyexpat import *

make: *** [install] Error 1
Makefile:1102: recipe for target 'install' failed
??? Python failed to install *sigh* continuing anyway
* Python bootstrapped
http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots
```
and then dies with:

```

You can leave off the sudo/su command. It's understood that you should have root privileges to use it, and if not, emerge itself will tell you.

The `emerge a[foo] b[bar]` syntax isn't right but there is no one-line command that does what we want. The closest thing is `USE="foo bar" emerge a b`, but the next time the user updates his system those `USE` flags will be lost. It also has the side effect of enabling `USE=foo` for `b` and `USE=bar` for `a`, which may not work. What should really be done is to place

```
a foo
b bar
```

in `/etc/portage/package.use`, or whatever is equivalent for pkgcore (the other Gentoo package manager). Pkgcore has its own, different, installation commands too.

The `a[foo]` syntax does make sense in users' heads, so to keep things simple, we could probably just have it say "install the following packages: a[foo] b[bar]", or something like that.

Ok, you got me, I had no idea that worked!

It still won't automatically enable the USE flag if it's not set, you get something like

```
$ emerge -pv1 sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]
...
The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:
 (see "package.use" in the portage(5) man page for more details)
# required by sci-mathematics/eclib[flint] (argument)
>=sci-mathematics/eclib-20190909 flint
```

but that's fine. It's telling you to do the right thing.

I've created `latest-gcc10` in addition to `latest`. For fun. 

```

====================================================
 sys-devel/gcc         9.3.0          10.1.0-r2

```

But `tox -e docker-gentoo-gcc10-maximal -- build doc-html doc-pdf ptest` says 

```
checking gcc version... 10.1.0
checking g++ version... 10.1.0
configure: Installing GCC because g++ -std=gnu++11 is g++ version 10.1.0, which is too recent for this version of Sage 
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gcc

Sage is not ready for gcc10 yet...

Good news, everyone!
We used one `latest` image, now we have two images:
* `latest` with python-3.8.5
* `latest-py37` with python-3.7.8


```
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... no, Python 3.8.5 is too recent
```

no changes to tox.ini is required, unless we want to be prepared for #29023 when most of installed packages would be used, in that case we can have both "gentoo" and "gentoo-py37" in tox.ini

Although overlay `cschwan/sage-on-gentoo` is not ready for `python-3.9` yet, 
`develop` branch of `sagemath/sage` accepts `python-3.9`.

So as if two images weren't enough, I used some ugly hacks to create third image -- `latest-py39`
