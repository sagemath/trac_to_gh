```
As a followup to #29053 and #29273, we
- extend `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` to generate a Dockerfile using https://hub.docker.com/r/sheerluck/sage-on-gentoo-stage4
- add `build/pkgs/gentoo*.txt`
- extend `bin/sage-print-system-package-command` to handle gentoo
- add gentoo to the platforms tested in [GitHub](GitHub) CI.

To test: `tox -e docker-gentoo-standard`

This is a part of:
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

OK... this is where I got now. The `./bootstrap-prefix.sh` script was claiming to bootstrap some packages - such as xz and patch - and succeeded with that; but then it was missing "xz" to unpack the Python sources. I think something is wrong there, but I added xz&patch in ubuntu. This is attached Dockerfile-sage_gentoo and log from 'docker build' with that. 

As you can see in the log, now it's complaining about a module missing in the Python that it just built:

```
  File "/gentoo/var/tmp/python-3.6.10/Python-3.6.10/Lib/xml/parsers/expat.py", line 4, in <module>
    from pyexpat import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyexpat'
make: *** [install] Error 1
Makefile:1102: recipe for target 'install' failed
??? Python failed to install *sigh* continuing anyway
* Python bootstrapped
http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots
```
and then dies with:

```
* Compiling prefix-portage

After installing a docker client, it only takes 

```
docker run -it gentoo/stage3-amd64
```
This gives you root prompt. I would need instructions on what to do next to install relevant gentoo packages here.

It still won't automatically enable the USE flag if it's not set, you get something like

The following USE changes are necessary to proceed:

checking for python3 >= 3.6.0, < 3.10.0 with modules ...  
checking ... whether /usr/bin/python3 is good... yes
```

Although overlay `cschwan/sage-on-gentoo` is not ready for `python-3.9` yet, 
`develop` branch of `sagemath/sage` accepts `python-3.9`.

So as if two images weren't enough, I used some ugly hacks to create third image -- `latest-py39`

If someone finds it usefull to play with python-3.9, tox.ini may be changed this way:
