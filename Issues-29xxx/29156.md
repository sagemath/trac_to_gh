This is something that might be a bug in pynac, or it might be that Sage is using pynac incorrectly. Here is an excerpt from pynac's `numeric::power` in `numeric.cpp`, which is what ends up being called in this example:

```
if (exponent.is_negative()) {
    long int_exp = -(expo.to_long());
    ...
}
```

In your example, `exponent` is what you think it should be (-21111111111/11111111111). Here's what `to_long` does:

```
if (mpz_fits_sint_p(v._bigint)) {
    long n = mpz_get_si(bigint);
    mpz_clear(bigint);
    return n;
}
mpz_clear(bigint);
throw conversion_error();
```

Here, `v._bigint` is the absolute value of the exponent's numerator, 21111111111. That happens to be a bit larger than 32 bits, so the if statement doesn't execute, and `throw_conversion_error` is called.

I haven't combed through pynac's documentation to see whether they point out that `numeric::power` shouldn't be called with negative rational exponents whose numerators are greater than 32 bits, but I can't see why they would want to do this and not do the same with positive numerators or denominators greater than 32 bits. So I *think* this is a bug in pynac.
