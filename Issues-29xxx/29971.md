I think it would be better to invent a new doctest tag such as "# random_seed=0" or whatever is syntactically convenient.

To advertise my point about testing this stuff random #29961. In this instance, the `get_random_element` thing really failed sometimes. It wasn't discovered before, because only seed 0 is tested.

What's the point about testing this only at seed 0. This doesn't tell us anything about how stable the method is.

But I should add a test that illustrates that this is an element of the correct thing.

Well, my main point is that test coverage before and after this ticket are really incomparable.  The change 
- drops the test for seed 0 giving a specific element (or, as you say, what looks like an element); 
- adds a test for an arbitrary seed giving no error and passing the `__contains__` test

The other thing that one could do, if you really want to keep the old test, is add the old test in the `TESTS` block (starting with `set_random_seed(0)`).

How about a Makefile target that runs tests with `random_seed=0`, or maybe a Makefile target that runs tests twice, once with `seed=0` and once with a random seed? Then make sure that people start thinking of that as the new default.

Or as `@`gh-kliem suggests, double up on some doctests:

```
    sage: test1
    sage: test2

End of test block::

    sage: test1 # random-seed=0
    sage: test2 # random-seed=0
```

I feel like the discussion is on the wrong ticket.

This ticket is merely about making tests in categories pass with a different random seed than `0`.

In principal a new flag `random-seed=0` sounds fine, but shouldn't be introduced here. That should be introduced in #29962 I think, or in a seperate follow up ticket that this here is based on.

The discussion about the big pictures mainly happened on sage-devel and on #29935 so far.

I mean there are 23 tickets like this and we should really come up with a uniform way to do them all. I'm fine with doing those 23 tickets, but if the general set up should be different, I might need some help with #29962 or #29935 (one introduces random seed, one makes them default after 23 tickets made all parts of sage compatible to it).
