> static SSTPoset(s, f=None)

> The poset on semistandard tableaux of shape s and largest entry f that is ordered by componentwise comparison of the entries.

This isn't just some finite poset; it's a lattice, with minimum and maximum being defined entrywise. That should be in the code and in the doc.

Any volunteers? (My Sage isn't working and I have a long to-do list of papers right now, so I pass.)
