This updates our patch to the makefile to support DESTDIR installation.  However, as I noted at https://github.com/tscrim/coxeter/issues/17 it would be better in the long-term if we fully adopted this library under the sagemath umbrella and integrated all our patches (albeit perhaps in less sage-specific ways).

For now this is good enough for me, but if a more thorough approach can be undertaken soon it could supersede this.

LGTM.

Sorry for the delay in getting to this. I agree it would be better to include better integration with Sage, but we should still try to keep it viable as a separate standalone library. Thank you for any assistance.
