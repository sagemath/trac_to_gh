The issue is already addressed upstream (but not in a release) by detecting support for `-march=native` and using that instead of a million individual flags. So reporting it upstream isn't going to do any good.

Option 1: I could move that code to the top-level configure.ac. I think it will serve its purpose there, although it will be a bit out of place.

Option 2: we could just disable those flags in spkg-install, and use #27122 to add back `-march=native`.

Option 3: leave it where it is, and count on the fact that nobody will want to build an extra copy of fflas-ffpack.

Can you just add them? I really don't want to sit through another rebuild after `git checkout` to add two lines of text =)

This does not work on Debian buster, as linbox needs a fresher fflas-ffpack:

```
checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for FFLAS_FFPACK... no
configure: error: Package requirements (fflas-ffpack >= 2.4.0) were not met:

Requested 'fflas-ffpack >= 2.4.0' but version of fflas-ffpack is 2.3.2
You may find new versions of fflas-ffpack at http://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables FFLAS_FFPACK_CFLAGS
and FFLAS_FFPACK_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

This seems to work well (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/75739694). Only very new distributions have a sufficiently new version, of course.

By the way, on `debian-buster-standard` system `fflas_ffpack` is already not used because its dependency `givaro` is too old.
