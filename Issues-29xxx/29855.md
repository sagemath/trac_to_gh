These header file locations (for use in Cython dependencies only) are currently hardcoded as living in `SAGE_INC`, which is no longer true.

This is a step toward #29711, and also preparation for #29847 because it removes use of `sage.env.SAGE_INC`.

LGTM this is much cleaner and much more appropriate.
