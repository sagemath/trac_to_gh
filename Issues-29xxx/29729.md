Since #12406, the `check` keyword to `solve_right` is ignored over all inexact rings. As discussed on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/1Ew9s16IhsE), this is a bit too drastic, as the solution can be checked for correctness in some cases.

Over `SR`, we can check if all entries are exact and then check whether the solution is correct. This was done in #33159.

Over ball and interval fields, we can check the error bounds to determine whether the result is valid.

```
sage: matrix(RIF, [[2/3, 1], [2/5, 3/5]]).solve_right(vector(RIF, [1, 1]))  # this solution is acceptable
([-infinity .. +infinity], [-infinity .. +infinity])
sage: matrix(RIF, [[0]]).solve_right(vector(RIF, [1]))  # this is not
(0)
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>The SR proof-of-concept passes a ptestlong, at least.

As for the ball/interval fields: half of the problem with RBF is that we have a dedicated implementation of `_solve_right_nonsingular_square` for complex ball matrices, but not for RBF ones. Thus we miss out on the work that the arb library has already done for these systems. Compare:

```
sage: A = matrix(RBF, [[2/3, 1], [2/5, 3/5]])
sage: b = vector(RBF, [1, 1])
sage: A.solve_right(b)
(nan, nan)

sage: A = A.change_ring(CBF)
sage: b = b.change_ring(CBF)
sage: A.solve_right(b)
...
ValueError: unable to invert this matrix
```

(Note: we should catch that exception and turn it into a `NotFullRankError`).

For the generic interval solve/check, as a first approximation, maybe we could multiply `A*x` and check that each component thereof intersects the corresponding component (interval) of `b`. That's as opposed to the default "check" implementation using literal equality that would fail. This needs an expert opinion as my understanding of interval systems is only wikipedia-deep.

The `NotFullRankError` is currently only used internally for control flow, so we should only raise it if we want `_solve_right_general` to be tried when `_solve_right_nonsingular_square` fails, in the case of `CBF`.

If vector equality is implemented by checking whether not any entries are different (as opposed to all entries being equal), for ball fields this means it is checked that no entries are disjoint balls, hence they must intersect.

```
sage: A = matrix(RBF, [[2/3, 1], [2/5, 3/5]])
sage: b = vector(RBF, [1, 1])
sage: x = A.solve_right(b)
sage: A * x == b
True
```
However, it would be more correct to check that every entry of `b`, as a ball/interval, is fully contained in the corresponding entry of `A * x`:

```
sage: all(u in v for u, v in zip(b, A*x))
True
```
I am not very familiar with interval arithmetics either, though.

From what I gather, a solution to an interval system **Ax** = **b** should be an interval vector **x** such that for all *x* in **x**, there exists some *A* in **A** and *b* in **b** with *Ax = b*. So I don't think either suggestion is quite right; mine because **Ax** can wind up being larger than necessary, and thus too lenient if we intersect it with **b**.

This does not seem quite right to me, as then **x** could always be shrinkened to just a single point, thus reducing the error to 0.

In my naive understanding, as we do not know the exact values of *A* and *b*, the solution **x** of the system **Ax** = **b** should satisfy:

    ∀ *A*∈**A** ∀ *b*∈**b** ∃ *x*∈**x** such that *Ax* = *b*.

Given **x** and **A**, let me denote the product by **y** = **Ax**. Then **y** should contain the set

    { *y*∈ℝ<sup>n</sup> | ∃ *A*∈**A** ∃ *x*∈**x** : *Ax* = *y* }.

(In particular, this means that ∀ *A*∈**A** ∀ *x*∈**x** ∃ *y*∈**y** such that *Ax* = *y*.)

Since **A** is non-empty, we can fix an arbitrary *A*∈**A**. Now, given any *b*∈**b**, we find an *x*∈**x** satisfying *Ax*=*b*, and so *b*∈**y**.

Therefore, under the above assumptions, it would be a necessary condition that **b** is contained in **y**.

Come to think of it, this will never hold if **A** has more rows than columns (and not everything is exact), as then *A* and *b* can easily be chosen such that no solution exists.
