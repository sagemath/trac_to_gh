`sage.structure` should only depend on basic categories such as `sage.categories.morphism`, `sage.categories.pushout` to support the parent/element framework and coercion, but not on more specialized ones such as `sage.categories.modular_abelian_varieties`.

This is for #29865 (`sage-objects`), which should pull in only a small part of `sage.categories` -- less than what `sage.categories.basic` imports.
