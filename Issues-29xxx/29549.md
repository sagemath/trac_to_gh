Instead of using `gettextize` at bootstrap time, we just vendor the files `m4/iconv.m4` and `config/config.rpath` in the source tree. 

This is done by using gnulib: `gnulib-tool --import iconv` (and ignoring all the other files that it is offering us).

(from dimpase on #27823)

Bruno Haible says on [bug-autoconf](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2021-01/msg00033.html) that one should use gnulib's iconv module to install `config.rpath` etc. Indeed, 

```
gnulib-tool --import iconv
```
will install `config.rpath` into `config/` (among with other things that probably can be ignored).
So this is something to try in order to get rid of the hacky `install_config_rpath()` in[comment:18](#comment%3A18)

Unfortunately, `gnulib` is not present on `homebrew` (https://repology.org/project/gnulib/versions), so we should not try to use it in the `bootstrap` phase... Of course we can just commit the generated file -- it probably does not change so often.

any reason for gnulib not being on `homebrew`?

upstream says: just use git to get `gnulib`, as there is nothing to build.
