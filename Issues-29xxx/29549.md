Instead of using `gettextize` at bootstrap time, we just vendor the files `m4/iconv.m4` and `config/config.rpath` in the source tree. 

This is done by using gnulib: `gnulib-tool --import iconv` (and ignoring all the other files that it is offering us).

any reason for gnulib not being on `homebrew`?

upstream says: just use git to get `gnulib`, as there is nothing to build.

Hmm, yes, we can in principle have `gnulib` installed as a git submodule...
