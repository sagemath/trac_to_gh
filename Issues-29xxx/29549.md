Instead of using `gettextize` at bootstrap time, we just vendor the files `m4/iconv.m4` and `config/config.rpath` in the source tree. 

This is done by using gnulib: `gnulib-tool --import iconv` (and ignoring all the other files that it is offering us).

any reason for gnulib not being on `homebrew`?

(anyhow, I'm testing this now).

upstream says: just use git to get `gnulib`, as there is nothing to build.

<a id='comment:16'></a>When actually trying to use the generated confball I get (on OSX):

```
Using cached file /Users/buildbot-sage/worker/sage_git/build/upstream/configure-4b0180ea3fe0842fd17ffa15afa79dc3b4bf2cd0.tar.gz
config/install-sh: Skipping hardlink pointing to itself: config/install-sh
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.
```
The build seems to continue but skipping to untar a file is probably not good...
