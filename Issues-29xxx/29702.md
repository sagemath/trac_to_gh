This is preparation for splitting sagelib into separate distutils packages, but a useful cleanup in any case.

As a follow-up of this ticket, as part of Meta-ticket #29705, the remaining very short `src/setup.py` should probably be moved to `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/` (alongside a symlink `src` -> `SAGE_ROOT/src`)
