Looking at:

```
$ cat build/pkgs/sagenb/dependencies 
$(STARTED) | pip babel flask flask_autoindex flask_babel flask_oldsessions flask_openid mathjax twisted sphinx

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.
```

Are there other dependencies to be removed from being standard? like babel ?
