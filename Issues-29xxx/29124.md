```
As a follow-up to #29053, we move the `build/pkgs/*.txt` files to a more systematic location.  This will simplify some scripts.

- `build/pkgs/_prereq/distros/debian.txt` etc. - records the minimal requirements (system packages) for installing from source. (we move the current `build/pkgs/debian.txt` etc. there)
- `build/pkgs/_bootstrap/distros/debian.txt` etc. - would record the additional requirements for running `./bootstrap` (we move the current `build/pkgs/debian-bootstrap.txt` there)

Related: 
- #28998: Add script-type _spkg_check package that installs tox, mock, pytest etc.
- #29557: `build/pkgs/_recommended` - records additional recommended packages such as texlive-xetex (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/prerequisites/Ubuntu)

Possible follow-up: 
- `build/pkgs/_toolchain/dependencies` - to replace some special Makefile targets currently in `build/make/Makefile.in`.

config.log with this branch on top of 9.3.beta3 (after running make first):

```
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ##
## Build status for each package:                                          ##

alabaster-0.7.12:                            does not support check for system package; will be installed as an SPKG
appnope-0.1.0.p0:                            does not support check for system package; will be installed as an SPKG
```

Still, I would suggest to also remove it from the list ` notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:`.

<a id='comment:70'></a>hmm, now I see

```
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 219, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    print(out)  # optional - build
Expected:
    SQLite
    ======
    ...
    SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained,
    serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
    ...
Got:
    sqlite: An SQL database engine
    ==============================
    <BLANKLINE>
    Description
    -----------
    <BLANKLINE>
    SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained,
    serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
    <BLANKLINE>
...
```
(and the same in line 232)

So more changes of these test outputs are needed.

The different heading (`sqlite: An SQL database engine`) comes from `src/doc/en/reference/spkg/sqlite.rst`, as far as me and grep can tell.
