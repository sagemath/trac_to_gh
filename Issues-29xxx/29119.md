The proposal is to have a `configure` script specific to sagelib itself.  This can reuse most of the work already done and to be done for #27330 in order to detect sagelib's non-Python compilation dependencies at build time (`spkg-configure.m4`).  `src/configure.ac` would be simpler than the `configure.ac` for sage-the-distribution, as it would not need to do anything related to `SAGE_LOCAL`, and (possibly) only needs to detect sagelib's direct dependencies.

This `configure` script can easily be included in source tarballs for sagelib, and can be called automatically by the `setup.py`.

For prior art on this, see [cysignals](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals) which also runs a `configure` script to detect dependencies for its C sources.  While I was at one time skeptical of cysignals' approach to this (it is unusual to make `configure` part of the build system for a Python package), over time I've found that it works very well in practice.

It uses standard tools that would already be available on systems capable of building sagelib in the first place, and does not introduce any new or out-of-the-ordinary concepts for packagers (aside from having a `configure` alongside `setup.py`).

It would explicitly check for sagelib's dependencies in a manner that can be used completely independently of sage-the-distribution.

* **Q:** What files would be generated by this `configure` script?
  * **A:** This proposal remains agnostic to that question.  It could be anything from header files, plain-text config files (as proposed in #22652 in 2017), shell scripts (such as `src/bin/sage-env-config` implemented in #21479 in 2016/17, currently written by `SAGE_ROOT/configure`) or Python modules under the `sage` package (such as `sage.env_config`, like #29022 had proposed), or the Python module `sage_conf` next to the `sage` module (as #29038 implemented).

* **Q:** How does this impact pip install of sagelib?
  * **A:** In the default case it would "just work": If all of sagelib's dependencies are met by the system then they will be detected on the default paths.  If any dependencies are missing that will be reported (hopefully clearly) and the build will fail.  When pip-installing setuptools-based packages, it is possible to pass additional command-line flags to the underlying `setup.py` call (see e.g. the `--global-option` and `--install-option` flags to `pip install`).  We could easily allow passing passing through additional flags to the underlying `configure` script if/when special customization is needed.

* **Q:** How does this impact installing sagelib in a virtualenv/venv?
  * **A:** Basically not at all/trivially: If the dependencies are already met by the system then this proceeds just as installing directly into the system site-packages.  If some of the dependencies are installed in the virtualenv itself, and we want to use them, it is necessary to pass additional `C(PP)FLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` so that the virtualenv is used as a header/library search path.  This is true of any package that has dependencies in a non-standard prefix.
    * In the virtualenv case we could in principle handle `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` automatically by checking for the `VIRTUALENV` environment variable, but this is a separate enhancement.

This is a nice idea that would have a place within the framework of
- #21707: Meta-ticket: Split sage-env into 5 to clean up sage configuration
- #21507: Task ticket: Make sagelib a pip-installable Python source package, listed on PyPI.

I see it as follows: 
1. An sdist of sagelib for PyPI would need to configure itself in some way. An autoconf-generated `configure` script could be a solution (though I seem to remember that in previous discussions this idea has met resistance -- not from me, I'm obviously in favor of autotools). As you say, this should be able to reuse the build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-configure.m4 infrastructure. 
  
   However, I don't think it is actionable at the moment because sagelib is not modular enough and depends on too many packages. Existing efforts such as using `Feature`s for sagelib configuration / modularization seem to have stalled. (by the way - #25828 needs help).

2. The build of sagelib within sage-the-distribution should definitely *not* run another round of "configure" because everything has already been determined.

3. My guess is that downstream packagers would prefer configuring sagelib statically - because some distribution-specific things need to be set manually anyway. 

So the way I see it, there are multiple ways how sagelib should get its build-time (and run-time) configuration.
This is exactly what #29038 (`sage_conf`) addressed. It defined one interface of reading a configuration (from shell and from Python) and provided the reference implementation for case 2 (build of sagelib within sage-the-distribution). This encourages multiple implementations for the multiple circumstances in which sagelib is built.

You could provide a new implementation of `sage_conf` for case 1 (PyPI), which would be distributed with an sdist of sagelib, using the autoconf approach.

Downstream packagers are invited to use their own implementation of `sage_conf` for case 3. This has not happened yet -- after all, so far there is no release that has `sage_conf`.

   * **A:** Basically not at all/trivially: If the dependencies are already met by the system then this proceeds just as installing directly into the system site-packages.  If some of the dependencies are installed in the virtualenv itself, and we want to use them, it is necessary to pass additional `C(PP)FLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` so that the virtualenv is used as a header/library search path.  This is true of any package that has dependencies in a non-standard prefix.
     * In the virtualenv case we could in principle handle `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` automatically by checking for the `VIRTUALENV` environment variable, but this is a separate enhancement.

Issue 1. I feel was more important, and would be addressed by this proposal, I think making for a good compromise.

And as I mentioned above, if there *was* a need to create a plain-text file with Sage configuration, that could also be just as easily output by a `configure` script alongside the .py file.


> The top-level distribution script would then check for things the distribution needs (like sqlite3 on the command line), and only needs to do very basic feature tests.

For now it would still need to do more than that, because it is needed to build the entire sage-the-distribution.  So it needs to decide what SPKGs to install.

The proposed configure for sagelib (which in the current repository layout would be under `src/configure`) would have nothing to do directly with SPKGs.  It would only detect the presence of the dependencies, and not do anything about installing them if they're missing.  The only relation it would have to SPKGs, is that in *generating* this configure script we can re-use all the checks we already implemented in the `spkg-configure.m4` files.

cmake has a much better marketing department :-)

Besides scons has a reputation for being very slow.
(iirc it is a full build tool, not like autoconf and cmake, which actually produce
makefiles for make or similar tools)



> IMO it tries to replace autotools, but does everything worse than autotools. You might as well just use autotools. Writing M4 sucks, but after you get everything written and ship a release or two with some missing files because you forgot to add `dist_` to the name, everything works pretty well.

That's pretty much more-or-less what I've heard as well; I never tried building a project with it myself, but have heard mostly frustration about it (even though I do think it's a good idea in principle).  Alas, for all its faults autoconf is battle-tested.

And since we already have increasingly robust M4 macros for testing sage's build dependencies it seems like the right choice here.
