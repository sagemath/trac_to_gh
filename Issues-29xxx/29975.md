Although this is unlikely to fail, the test should agree with the documentation, so please apply this change for the uniform distribution:

```diff
     Uniform distribution on the interval ``[a, b]``::
 
         sage: a = 0
         sage: b = 2
         sage: T = RealDistribution('uniform', [a, b])
-        sage: a <= T.get_random_element() < b
+        sage: a <= T.get_random_element() <= b
         True
```

For the Pareto distribution, you could also add a test that `s >= b`. Similarly, the Rayleigh, Lognormal, F, Chisquared and Weibull distributions are ≥ 0, and the Beta distribution lives on [0,1].

Finally, I think this test should document the expected outcome, for clarity:

```diff
         sage: [1.0*x/nr_samples for x in counts]  # abs tol 1e-1
-        [0.304200000000000, 0.397300000000000, 0.298500000000000]
+        [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
```

I hope it is sufficiently unlikely that this test fails, but it is not impossible.

I even modified it down to `3e-2`. I tested it and the maximal difference is `0.0192` in 10 000 runs. So I guess it is much less likely than 1 in 10 000 that this test will fail.

Thanks for the updates. The change to multigraphics seems unintentional – I have removed it from your commit. I have also fixed another doctest:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 55.4 --random-seed=2001 src/sage/numerical/optimize.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/numerical/optimize.py", line 264, in sage.numerical.optimize.find_local_minimum
Failed example:
    plot(f, (x,-2.5, 2)).ymin()
Expected:
    -2.1827...
Got:
    -2.182677572710766
```
You can set this to positive if you agree with my changes.
