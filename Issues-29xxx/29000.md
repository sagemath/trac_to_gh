```
To allow non-standard locations for `readline` (e.g. with MacOS Homebrew)
one should use `# distutils: include_dirs = ` etc in `sage/libs/readline.pxd` to make it look in non-standard locations.

`readline/spkg-configure.m4` should set up appropriate variables
to be filled in and exported in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`; in turn
they should make it into `cython_aliases` in `sage/env.py`. 

This came up in this [thread on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/91e0GfHT-Yo/Vvj8X8ESCgAJ).

I am hesitant to permanently install Homebrew's readline to `/usr/local` as this is against what is intended by Homebrew. In the case of readline though, I am not sure how much of a problem this really is.

GAP needs a "real" readline, not a MacOS's libedit.

IIRC, sagelib's readline also needs "real" readline.

I did try installing Homebrew's readline into /usr/local, it seems to cause no harm, and
allowed builds to work on MacOS 10.13.

This might explain why I currently see several persistent doctest timeouts with this setup. Giac seems to be affected, as well. I am a bit surprised the build does not fail with this incompatible readline (other than for `sage.libs.readline`).

Thanks for adding the link to the problem description.

What is happening here is that you are relying on an automake feature that our build system (unfortunately) does not have.

It is true that one can set variables by passing them to `configure`, and they will be respected during the `configure` run and remembered in `config.status`. However, in our build system they are not saved in any configure-generated output file:

```
$ ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/xyzzy1" CPPFLAGS="-I/xyzzy2" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/xyzzy3"
$ grep xyzzy build/make/Makefile-auto build/make/Makefile src/Makefile src/bin/sage-env-config build/bin/sage-build-env-config build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/sage_conf.py build/pkgs/sage_conf/src/setup.cfg
```
... except in the automake-generated file `build/make/Makefile-auto`, which is not used at all in our build process.

```
build/make/Makefile-auto:CPPFLAGS =  -I/xyzzy2
build/make/Makefile-auto:LDFLAGS = -L/xyzzy1
build/make/Makefile-auto:PKG_CONFIG_PATH = /xyzzy3
```

Also PARI's `spkg-install.in` hardcodes readline to come from `SAGE_LOCAL`

```
bash ./Configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" \
    --with-readline="$SAGE_LOCAL" $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP \
    --with-runtime-perl="/usr/bin/env perl" \
    --kernel=gmp $PARI_CONFIGURE 
```
which is not correct when `readline/spkg-configure.m4` found a system readline.

On `local-homebrew-macos-standard` (#29417), this leads to:

```
Hi-Res Graphics: none
###
### Editline wrapper detected, building without readline support
###
### Building without GNU readline support
```
