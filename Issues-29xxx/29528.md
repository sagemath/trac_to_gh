If this error occurs when running the tests, it is usually persistent and reproducible, but isolating the problem is difficult, as the corresponding doctest does not fail when run standalone.

Thanks for the report. This confirms that this problem also occurs with Singular 4.1.1p2 – the version currently in Sage.

see also #30745 where this raises again, with Flint 2.6.3. 

But interestingly with #25993 (with these tests reinstated) everything works.
