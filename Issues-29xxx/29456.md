As all build errors of standard packages with gcc/gfortran 10 have been fixed, we change the `gcc` and `gfortran` configure scripts to again accept these versions.

This ticket does not change the version of the gcc spkg.

Previous tickets:
- gf2x: #29390 gf2x build fails on `fedora-32-minimal`
- SciPy: Upgrade to SciPy 1.2.3 (last release supporting py2 - #29443) does not fix it
- #29766: Upgrade NumPy, scipy, networkx, add pybind11 package (dup: #29425)
- sympow: see #3360
- palp: #29859
- gcc: #29674: fedora-32: Building gcc (9.2.0) spkg fails with gcc 10
- #30067 `gfortran` spkg-configure: Reject versions >= 10

I just adopted the patch already shipped in fedora until a new release.

* sympow is fixed by upgrading to the new fork.
* scipy can be fixed by adding some fortran flags until they fix the code, `-std=legacy` I think. I otherwise built sage-on-gentoo successfully with gcc-10 but I am not sure I have scanned absolutely all the packages.

-Various packages have build errors with gcc 10, which is shipped with `fedora-32`. 
-Hopefully we can wait for upstream to fix these errors.
+As all build errors of standard packages with gcc/gfortran 10 have been fixed, we change the `gcc` and `gfortran` configure scripts to again accept these versions.
 
+This ticket does not change the version of the gcc spkg.
+
+Previous tickets:
 - gf2x: #29390 gf2x build fails on `fedora-32-minimal`
 - SciPy: Upgrade to SciPy 1.2.3 (last release supporting py2 - #29443) does not fix it
 - #29766: Upgrade NumPy, scipy, networkx, add pybind11 package (dup: #29425)
 - sympow: see #3360
 - palp: #29859
 - gcc: #29674: fedora-32: Building gcc (9.2.0) spkg fails with gcc 10
-
-Also see:
 - #30067 `gfortran` spkg-configure: Reject versions >= 10
