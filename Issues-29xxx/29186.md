In #27086 we have implemented simplicity and simpliciality for combinatorial polyhedra. We expose this methods in `Polyhedron_base`.

The methods return the largest `k` such that the polytope is `k`-simple/simplicial. In case of unbounded polyhedra a `NotImplementedError` is raised.

A polytope is `k`-simplicial if every `k`-face is a simplex. It is `k`-simple if its dual/polar is `k`-simplicial.

Some comments:

```diff
-        Return the largest `k` such that the polytope is `k`-simple.
-
-        Return the dimension in case of a simplex.
-
-        A polytope `P` is `k`-simple, if every `(d-1-k)`-face
-        is contained in exactly `k+1` facets of `P` for `1 <= k <= d-1`.
-
-        Equivalently it is `k`-simple if the polar/dual polytope is `k`-simplicial.
+        Return the largest integer `k` such that the polytope is `k`-simple.
+
+        A polytope `P` is `k`-simple, if every `(d-1-k)`-face
+        is contained in exactly `k+1` facets of `P` for `1 <= k <= d-1`.
+        Equivalently it is `k`-simple if the polar/dual polytope is `k`-simplicial.
+        If `self` is a simplex, it returns its dimension.
```

similarly:

```diff
-        Return the largest `k` such that the polytope is `k`-simplicial.
-
-        Return the dimension in case of a simplex.
-
-        A polytope is `k`-simplicial, if every `k`-face is a simplex.
+        Return the largest interger `k` such that the polytope is `k`-simplicial.
+
+        A polytope is `k`-simplicial, if every `k`-face is a simplex.
+        If `self` is a simplex, returns its dimension.
```

Once this is fixed and the bots gives a green light, you can set this on positive review on my behalf.

```diff
+        is contained in exactly `k+1` facets of `P` for `1 <= k <= d-1`.
