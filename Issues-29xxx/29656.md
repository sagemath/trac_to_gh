There is no `build/pkgs/X/distros/gentoo.txt` for `X in {m4rie, eclib}` - which are otherwise perfectly OK.

Also, gentoo's cbc (i.e. `coinor-cbc`) package is present, but outdated, so Sage can't use it. Perhaps, update?

I'm working on CoinOR in Gentoo, but there are several packages I have to update at the same time, all with bugs open, and all sharing the same dumpster fire build system.

Our package for m4rie is `sci-libs/m4rie` and eclib is `sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]`. You can just add those and make this positive review on my behalf if you want. It's a trivial change.

I had a go 6 months ago but ended up in a big mess. I unfortunately didn't put it on git and have nothing to show for my efforts.

> Our package for m4rie is `sci-libs/m4rie` and eclib is `sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]`. You can just add those and make this positive review on my behalf if you want. It's a trivial change.


I don't remember you doing `m4rie`, I have to update the overlay.

This is with Gentoo g++8.3.1-r2 p4 (in case it matters)

perhaps I must learn/get properly set up to properly report gentoo bugs...

I am fairly sure that's because the dependencies of coinor-cbc haven't been updated. Dependencies haven't been pulled because the ebuild doesn't ask for minimum versions of the dependencies. I'd recommend you update all ebuilds returned by the command `eix -Ic coinor`, all in one emerge command so portage can sort out the dependencies.

`emerge -uD coinor-cbc` will update the dependencies as well. It's an ebuild problem. I didn't notice that new version bounds were necessary.
