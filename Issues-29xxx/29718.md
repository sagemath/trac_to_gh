-This ticket implements a class to work with them. It uses [data files](http://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/marin/representationH4-en.html) supplied by Iwan Marin for a basis of the cubic Hecke algebras up to 4 strands and corresponding regular representation matrices.

-2. In a mathematical sense, since the cubic Hecke algebra on more than 4 strands is not equipped with an appropriate basis (not even an algorithm to produce a flat basis according to Iwan Marin's work on the five strand cubic Hecke algebra).

Both of the new directories contain just one module. Their purpose is to describe the special properties of matrix representations and base rings concerning the cubic Hecke algebra. Thus, in the latter case the corresponding module contains special classes for the most general base ring of the algebra (called the *ring of definition*) and a corresponding ring for the coefficients of the split irreducible matrix representations.

-From the point of view of the algebra the ring of definition must not necessarily contain the roots of the defining cubic equation. Thus, it is defined by `\Z[u, v, w, w^(-1)]` where the indeterminates are taken from the coefficients of the underlying cubic equation `x**3 - u*x**2 + v*x - w`. But, concerning the split irreducible representations the roots (in Ivan Marin's papers often denoted `a, b, c`) are needed, and in addition a third root of unity (for the nine-dimensional representations of the cubic Hecke algebra on 4 strands). Accordingly, this ring is realized as a Laurent polynomial ring in `a, b, c` over `\Z` adjoined with a third root of unity. It can be considered as an extension of the ring of definition, more precisely as the [link ticket splitting algebra] of the cubic equation.
-
-These both classes of base rings posses a method `create_specialization` which allows the user to consider cubic Hecke algebras over other base rings. Thus, the user may choose his own coefficients or roots of the cubic equation as long, as they define a valid ring homomorphism from the corresponding generic base ring.
