We implement the slack matrix for polyhedra.

This matrix contains all the evaluations of Hrepresentation elements on Vrepresentation elements.

This method can be used to obtain the incidence matrix much quicker (at least for base ring rationals or integers).

To obtain the slack matrix is currently much quicker than the incidence matrix:

sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: P = P.base_extend(QQ)

Wall time: 160 ms
sage: %time _ = P.incidence_matrix()
