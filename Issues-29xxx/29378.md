0.3.9 was released in Feb 2020. https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases

The upgrade fixes the build error of `iml` on `fedora-32-standard`, caused by our openblas installation of 0.3.6 being underlinked (details - see #29393).

The upstream tarball URL is in `checksums.ini`. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" openblas`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.
