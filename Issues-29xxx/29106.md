As a followup to #29053, in analogy to the work done for debian/fedora/arch/conda, we
add files `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/cygwin.txt` to keep track of equivalent distribution packages

using these sources:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-build.list
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/blob/master/cygwin-sage-runtime.list
- https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/Cygwin64Port

Follow-up: #29295 - Add [GitHub](GitHub) CI workflow for cygwin
