One can authenticate themselves on the trac server in two ways. Either they have a trac username and password, or via [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub). 

To be authenticated via [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub), following the steps on the `Collaborative Development with Git-Trac`[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html) page, one would log onto the trac server and generate a token, and then type the following command in the terminal as given in the documentation:

`git trac config --user=<username> --token=<token>`

However, it is extremely easy to miss the fact that the username to be entered here is NOT the [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) username, but rather the trac username which is `gh-<GitHub-username>` as given on the top right corner of the trac server.

This ticket is basically to add a note in the page: [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html) reminding new developers of their trac username. 

One would have to find where in the sage directory structure the documentation file exists, make the relevant changes and commit. 


Keywords: **documentation, authentication, developer**

If you are authenticating through **GitHub** on trac server then it's better you use OAuth directly provided by **Github** which is a much easier way of authenticating.
