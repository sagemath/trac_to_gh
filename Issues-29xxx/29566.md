In case the combinatorial polyhedron is initialized from a matrix, we store the incidence matrix to avoid recomputation.

Note, that this is also the case when the combinatorial polyhedron is obtained e.g. from a polyhedron. In this case the incidence matrix is computed and then this is used to initialize the combinatorial polyhedron.
