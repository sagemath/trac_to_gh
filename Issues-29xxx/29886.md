We add a method to the `MatrixSpace` class that returns a generator over
the symmetric matrices in the space. The "symmetry" is defined by the user.

Remove space before closing parenthesis:

```
- def symmetric_matrices(self, f, g=None ):
+ def symmetric_matrices(self, f, g=None):
```

Typo: doesn't contains -> doesn't contain.

Use a space after each comma in code,
and around `+` signs.

Use double backticks, e.g. <code>\`\`f\`\`</code> or <code>\`\`ValueError\`\`</code>
for code formatting in docstrings.

Typo "funcition" -> function.

Use code formatting for `None`:
`if it is None` -> <code>if it is \`\`None\`\`</code>

```
- skew-symmetric matrices:
+ Skew-symmetric matrices:
```

Typo: `MetricSpace` -> `MatrixSpace`.

Hint: after making changes, rebuild Sage and test with

```
sage -t src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py
```
before pushing. That would catch things such as `MetricSpace`.

Replace this doctest whose output is hard to parse:

```
sage: gen = MS.symmetric_matrices(f)
sage: for M in gen:
....:     print(M)
```
by this one whose output takes up less space and is easier to parse:

```
sage: list(MS.symmetric_matrices(f))
```

Likewise, replace this:

```
sage: gen = MS.symmetric_matrices(f)
sage: i = 0
sage: for M in gen:
....:     i+= 1
....:     print(M)
....:     if i == 3: break
```
with this more concise:

```
sage: gen = MS.symmetric_matrices(f)
sage: [next(gen) for _ in range(3)]
```

Remove spaces around `M` in `def make_symmetric( M ):`.

Simplify "can't have symmetric matrices if they are not square"
to "symmetric matrices must be square" or "only square matrices
can be symmetric".

Use a space after `#` for comments, for instance:

```
- #When the base ring is not finite,
+ # When the base ring is not finite,
```

For inline comments, double space before `#` and single space after.
For instance:

```
matrix_entries = []  # entries of matrix with lower half 0
```

No need to comment `#make M symmetric` before
`make_symmetric(M)`, function name says it all.

Rather than importing

```
import sage.combinat.integer_vector
```
and using `sage.combinat.integer_vector.IntegerVectors`, instead import

```
from sage.combinat.integer_vector import IntegerVectors
```
and then use `IntegerVectors`.

Use `is None` to test if something is `None`:

```
- if g == None:
+ if g is None:
```

I would also use `f=None` to mean `f` is the identity --
giving the standard "symmetric" matrices:

```
if f is None:
    f = lambda x: x
```

I would write the input as:

```
- ``f`` -- function or ``None`` (optional; default: ``None``);
  if ``None``, use the identity function

- ``g`` -- function or ``None`` (optional; default: ``None``);
  if ``None``, use the same function as for ``f``
```

Need to decide what symmetric should mean
- Among possible definitions:
  - subdiagonal entries are images by ``f`` of the
    corresponding superdiagonal entries, i.e.
    for any `i < j` we have `A[j,i] = f(A[i,j])`
  - nondiagonal entries are images by ``f``
    of their mirror entries, i.e.
    for any `i != j` we have `A[j,i] = f(A[i,j])`
- These are the same if `f` is an involution;
  if that is assumed it needs to be said
- Accordingly, do all or only half the checks

I would avoid formulas in the docstring's first sentence
and clarify in a second sentence:

```
Return a generator of all matrices in this matrix space
that are "symmetric" as defined by `f` and `g`.

This means subdiagonal entries are images by ``f``
of the corresponding superdiagonal entries, i.e.
for any ``i < j`` we have ``A[j,i] = f(A[i,j])``,
and diagonal elements are stable by ``g`` ,
i.e. for any ``i`` we have ``A[i,i] = g(A[i,i])``.

The default value of ``None`` for ``f`` means
``f`` is the identity, and the default value
of ``None`` for ``g`` means ``g`` is ``f``.
```

Need `::` here to start the doctest block:

```
Skew-symmetric matrices::
```

I would use `v` rather than `iv` for the loop variable.

Comments could be more concise:

```
- # If the number of entries is zero, then just
- # yield the empty matrix in that case and return
+ # If no entries, yield empty matrix and return
  if number_of_entries == 0:
      yield self(0)
      return
```

```
- # When the base ring is not finite, then we should go
- # through and yield the matrices by "weight", which is
- # the total number of iterations that need to be done
- # on the base ring to reach the matrix.
+ # For infinite rings, yield matrices by "weight",
+ # i.e. by number of iterations needed to reach them.
```

```
- # In the finite case, we do a similar thing except that
- # instead of checking if the diagonal is correct after creating the vector
- # we can select all possible diagonal elements a priori
+ For finite rings, allow all ring elements on the diagonal a priori.
```

I don't think new classes are really needed. Instead, just methods that construct submodules.

Unfortunately, currently `MatrixSpace` does not fully implement the category of modules with bases (see (`sage.categories.modules_with_basis`) that it claims to belong to.

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(QQ, 3, 3)
sage: M in ModulesWithBasis(QQ)
True
sage: A = M([[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
sage: A
[0 0 1]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
sage: M.submodule([A])
AttributeError: 'MatrixSpace_with_category' object has no attribute 'get_order'
```

I would suggest to start with fixing the implementation of this functionality of `MatrixSpace`.

Then in the next step, you can define the methods that construct the specific modules that you need.

I usually thing of the sub/superdiagonal matrices as just being the entries immediately off the diagonal, not in all of the lower/upper triangular part.

A lot of what this method does is really confusing to me. The algorithm should be explained in the docstring, in particular the order which it is iterating through everything.

I also somewhat agree with Matthias here. I would first expect this to return a subspace, which doesn't work for generic `f` and `g`. Plus the word "symmetric" seems misleading to me for generic `f` and `g`. Perhaps as a middle ground, we call this `symmetric_matrices_iterator()`. 

Comments from a quick look at the code:

I don't see why you need to do `v2.clone()` since you never modify it. You simply get a sublist that to reassign to `v`.

`self(0)` -> `self.zero()`.

This is very strange: `for _ in range(nrows):`. I don't understand this code block.

Attachment: **[traceback.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket29886/traceback.txt)**

I spent some time looking at the `submodule` method to see if there was some easy fix. I think I got 90% of the way.
There were some issues in the method `sage.categories.finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.echelon_form`.

```diff

+            mat = matrix(self.base_ring(), [g._vector_(order=full_order) for g in elements])

             if row_reduced and self.base_ring() not in Fields():

```

After applying that patch there is an issue with mutable matrices not being hashable. The issue seems to lie in `sage.misc.cachefunc` and I don't have enough knowledge of python or the inner working of Sage to proceed.

Honestly, I had a huge amount of issues with matrices/vectors not being hashable, so I wonder why aren't they immutable by default.
