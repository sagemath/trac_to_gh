At the current stage, we get the following output:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2
sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                                intersection_name='W',
....:                                restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: f = M.scalar_field_algebra()(x+u)
sage: f.display()
M --> R
sage: f._express
{}
```

This output is not consistent with the coercion model, in particular not with the coercion `SR -> ScalarFieldAlgebra`. First of all, each element in `SR` should give rise to a well-defined element in `ScalarFieldAlgebra`. This is not fulfilled in the first example. More precisely:

```
sage: g = A(x)
sage: g.display()
M --> R
on U: (x, y) |--> x
on W: (u, v) |--> u/(u^2 + v^2)
sage: h = V.scalar_field_algebra()(x)
sage: h.display()
V --> R
on W: (u, v) |--> u/(u^2 + v^2)
on W: (x, y) |--> x
```

The scalar fields resulting from the coercion `SR -> ScalarFieldAlgebra` are not defined on the whole manifold, as they should be for a coercion. In fact, the results are not even *well*-defined since they are not uniquely determined by the input.

Things get more out of control if no transition map is stated (for example, the transitivity axiom for coercions is violated). However, we probably can assume that this would not reflect the intended usage.

What about applying `add_expr_by_continuation` to obtain a scalar field on the whole manifold? This would also result in an error message if no transition map has been stated and solve two problems at once.

I agree. However, the symbolic ring is stated as the base ring of the commutative algebra of scalar fields, which means that there must be a coercion by definition.

Alternatively, the base ring must be changed. But to what?

The implementation of the scalar field algebra is currently a bit of an abuse since `SR` is not the true base topological field of the manifold, just an approximation for it. However, there is a good case for the convenience of having it. If you decide to not keep the abuse, then I would change the base field of the scalar field algebra to be the base field of the manifold.

Well, I am not sure, because in addition to the coordinate symbols, we need other variables, which may represent some parameters in the scalar field. For instance, we may have

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')

To clarify, we have currently:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')                                                      
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                                                       
sage: a = var('a', domain='real')                                                             
sage: f = M.scalar_field(a*x)
sage: g = a*f                                                                   
sage: g                                                                         
Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: g.display()                                                               
M --> R
(x, y) |--> a^2*x
```
Having `SR` be the base field of the scalar field algebra allows the operation `a*f` to work directly, but maybe there is a better way...

I see your point. What about using the option `accepting_variables` and then successively add parameters to the base ring?

Do you mean calling `accepting_variables` internally, i.e. in a way transparent to the user? I don't think we can ask the end user to do something more fancy than `var('a')...
