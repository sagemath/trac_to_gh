this is a relatively stable C library, the only problem is that there are also very old versions (2.2.0 on Fedora 26) around, and it's not quite clear whether they work and how to distinguish them.

We do the latter by checking for `link` member in `vertexRec` from `planarity/graphStructures.h`

<a id='comment:2'></a>2.2.0 prevents sagelib building, as `planarity/graphStructures.h` should have

```
typedef struct
{
        int  link[2];
        int  index;
        unsigned flags;
} vertexRec;
```
and not

```
typedef struct
{
        int DFSParent, leastAncestor, Lowpoint, adjacentTo;
        int pertinentBicompList, separatedDFSChildList, fwdArcList;
} vertexRec;
```

So we can write a test using `AC_COMPILE_IFELSE()`.
