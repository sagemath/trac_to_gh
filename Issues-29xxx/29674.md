To work around build failures of some SPKGs with gcc 10, in particular on fedora-32 (#29456), 
we reject system gcc 10 and build the gcc spkg instead.

That itself requires patches, which we get from https://bugs.gentoo.org/708346, for the following error:

I'm skeptical that this worked in the first place (that's a shell pipe, not a regex):

```
AS_CASE(["$GXX_VERSION.0"],
                [[[0-3]].*|4.[[0-7]].*], [
```

I can't really test this but the changes are reasonable. The main risk with something like this is that the patches would break something with older glibc, but the fact that upstream backported these two patches to the 9.3 branch suggests that they wouldn't. The CI checks confirm that, and everyone else will be using their system GCC anyway, so let's try it.
