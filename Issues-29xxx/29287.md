This ticket, inspired by a proposal by embray in #24586, removes the misuse of "package type" for the undocumented "script package" category (introduced in #19427). Likewise, it removes the same misuse of "package type" for the undocumented (as noted in #21033) "pip package" category (introduced in #19187).

With this ticket, `type` has to be one of `base` / `standard` / `optional` / `experimental`.

All `type=pip` packages are changed to `optional`.

All `type=script` packages are changed to `optional`; with the exception of `sage_conf`, which is a dependency of `sagelib` and is changed to `standard`.

Orthogonal to `type` is the new notion of a package "source", which is defined as follows:
- `normal` packages have a `checksum.ini` file
- `pip` packages have a `requirements.txt` file instead (which is used for `pip install`). (This allows us to change the `pyopenssl` package from `script` to `pip`.)
- `script` packages have neither of the two

The ticket also makes `script` packages more similar to `normal` packages: They can now optionally have a `package-version.txt` file; and their installation status is recorded.

Finally, this ticket adds documentation to the developer manual.

-This would enable having "optional" "script" packages. (Needed for #27952 - libnauty)
+This ticket, inspired by a proposal by embray in #24586, removes the misuse of "package type" for the undocumented "script package" category (introduced in #19427). Likewise, it removes the same misuse of "package type" for the undocumented (as noted in #21033) "pip package" category (introduced in #19187).
 
-`type` would only be used for `standard`/`optional`/`experimental`.
+With this ticket, `type` has to be one of `base` / `standard` / `optional` / `experimental`.
 
-- `normal` packages have a `checksum.ini`
-- `pip` packages have `requirements.txt` instead
+All `type=pip` packages are changed to `optional`.
+
+All `type=script` packages are changed to `optional`; with the exception of `sage_conf`, which is a dependency of `sagelib` and is changed to `standard`.
+
+Orthogonal to `type` is the new notion of a package "source", which is defined as follows:
+- `normal` packages have a `checksum.ini` file
+- `pip` packages have a `requirements.txt` file instead (which is used for `pip install`)
 - `script` packages have neither of the two
 
+The ticket also makes `script` packages more similar to `normal` packages: They can now optionally have a `package-version.txt` file; and their installation status is recorded.
+
+Finally, this ticket adds documentation to the developer manual.

we had an argument about it, and that change should have been done when the actual conversion of most of sage-install scripts into templates happened, a couple of years back. So this change merely corrects an old fault of the naming scheme.

<a id='comment:41'></a>The doctest was actually "broken" by #29038 in the situation when the `sage_conf` package that it added is installed.
See ticket description of #29038 -- in particular, it provides `SAGE_ROOT` in the situation that Python imports `sage.all` outside of a sage-env.
That doctest was testing that `SAGE_ROOT` is not provided in that situation -- when it should simply have tested that the `sage.all` module works.

The present ticket makes sure that `sage_conf` is always installed (fixes #29365, for example), and so you now saw the doctest failure.
