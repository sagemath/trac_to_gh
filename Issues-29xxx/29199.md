With #28880 at hand, it makes sense to set up polyhedra from both Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation, if the backend supports it.

This is faster an any case, if the backend supports precomputed data (currently only `field`, but `polymake` and `normaliz` potentially can do that as well). Otherwise it might be faster, as it chooses the shorter representation by default. E.g.

- setting up a hypercube is then done by inequalities instead of vertices,
- translating a hypercube should be done by inequalities not by vertices.

This ticket collects all those instances, where we will set up the polyhedron from both Vrep and Hrep:

- From the library:
  - #29198: hypercube,
  - #29323: cross polytope,
  - #29325: permutahedron.
- Polyhedral constructions:
  - #29569: polar,
  - #29583: product,
  - #33653: join,
  - #29843: affine hull, linear transformation
  - #29200: dilation,
  - #29324: translation,
  - #32150: prism,
  - #32151: pyramid,
  - #32152: bipyramid.
  - #31801: `PolyhedronFace.as_polyhedron`
