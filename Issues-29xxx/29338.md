The proposed branch adds 2 new methods which allows what follows:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links import dlx_solver
sage: rows = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [0,1], [2,3,4,5], [0], [1,2,3,4,5]]
sage: d = dlx_solver(rows)
sage: d.one_solution()
[1, 0]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver('cryptominisat')
[2, 3]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver('glucose')
[2, 3]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver('glucose-syrup')
[2, 3]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver('picosat')
[4, 5]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver('LP')
[2, 3]
sage: d.one_solution_using_sat_solver()
[2, 3]
```

This is based on the new method:

```
sage: d.to_sat_solver()
CryptoMiniSat solver: 6 variables, 24 clauses.
```

A question about the interface. Since we are going to have:
- `one_solution`
- `one_solution_using_sat_solver`
- `one_solution_using_milp_solver` # with #29955
I think it would it be better to have only one method that dispatches to the various solvers. Then one can do the following:
- `one_solution(solver="dlx")`
- `one_solution(solver="cryptominisat")`
- `one_solution(solver="picosat")`
- `one_solution(solver="Gurobi")` # with #29955
- `one_solution(solver="CLPLEX")` # with #29955
What do you think? (I can do this if you think it is a good idea.)

I made that choice to make it explicit that we are not using the dlx solver (we can not compare timing (at least on the first call) for example, because of the initialization of the rows is already done when using "dlx") and to make explicit that there is a overhead in doing the translation of the thousands of rows into something else.

I think `one_solution(solver='Gurobi')` should not be something so much desirable, since if this is really what is the most efficient, then one should just construct the `MILP` directly.

What do you think is best to do?

Ah, this is a very good point! So I should think of the principal goal of this ticket as the implementation of `to_sat_solver`, and `one_solution_using_sat_solver` is a shortcut for the following:

```
sage: d.to_sat_solver('glucose').solve()  # not the correct syntax; see below
```
[Note that `solve` is not a method for `sat`; the above should be `d.to_sat_solver('glucose')()` instead.]
