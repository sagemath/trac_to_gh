 ValueError: Could not lock sequences (None)
 ```
 
+This comes from the depth of NumPy's code that tries to determine ABI by inspecting some compiled code (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/core/setup_common.py).
+
+An update of NumPy to latest release, 1.18.2 (which requires updating Cython to at least 0.29.14) fixes it.
+We update Cython to latest release, 0.29.16
+
+
 This can be tested with #29415:
 
 ```
   tox -e local-conda-forge-macos-standard
 ```

it seems that these warnings are coming from scipy itself, or from networkx

Let me see if upgrading networkx helps.

I don't know how to filter multiline warnings with python backtraces.

OK, I've opened #29766 to fix this. This one is good to go, modulo the latter.

Unfortunately there seem to be problems with runner setups, e.g. here 
https://github.com/dimpase/sage/runs/740349791?check_suite_focus=true
- this is `docker (archlinux-latest, standard-gcc_spkg)`
I see

```
2020-06-04T22:39:01.9688082Z Suggested packages:
2020-06-04T22:39:01.9688790Z   python3-pytest python-setuptools-doc
```
and a lot of 

```
2020-06-05T03:08:41.2134392Z Failure: ModuleNotFoundError (No module named 'pytest') ... ERROR
```
which seems to suggest that `python3-pytest` is a requirement.

Do you know how to fix this?

(there are other errors pointing at internal problems of runners)

Can we easily extend setup to use our own runners?

Apparently, running the testsuite of networkx requires pytest. Let's discuss this on #29766.

I don't think this has anything to do with [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub).

Actually, on `ubuntu-xenial-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/745921419), I see lots of failures from the `networkx` testsuite such as this one:

```

        if cb.is_numlike(alpha):
    AttributeError: module 'matplotlib.cbook' has no attribute 'is_numlike'
