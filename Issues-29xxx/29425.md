it seems that these warnings are coming from scipy itself, or from networkx
(which in turn calls scipy).

Let me see if upgrading networkx helps.

I don't know how to filter multiline warnings with python backtraces.

OK, I've opened #29766 to fix this. This one is good to go, modulo the latter.

which seems to suggest that `python3-pytest` is a requirement.

Do you know how to fix this?

(there are other errors pointing at internal problems of runners)

Can we easily extend setup to use our own runners?

Actually, on `ubuntu-xenial-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/745921419), I see lots of failures from the `networkx` testsuite such as this one:

```
