it seems that these warnings are coming from scipy itself, or from networkx

Let me see if upgrading networkx helps.

I don't know how to filter multiline warnings with python backtraces.

OK, I've opened #29766 to fix this. This one is good to go, modulo the latter.

Unfortunately there seem to be problems with runner setups, e.g. here 
https://github.com/dimpase/sage/runs/740349791?check_suite_focus=true
- this is `docker (archlinux-latest, standard-gcc_spkg)`
I see

2020-06-04T22:39:01.9688790Z   python3-pytest python-setuptools-doc
```
and a lot of 

```
2020-06-05T03:08:41.2134392Z Failure: ModuleNotFoundError (No module named 'pytest') ... ERROR
```
which seems to suggest that `python3-pytest` is a requirement.

Do you know how to fix this?

(there are other errors pointing at internal problems of runners)

Can we easily extend setup to use our own runners?

Actually, on `ubuntu-xenial-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/745921419), I see lots of failures from the `networkx` testsuite such as this one:

```
File "/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/networkx-2.2/src/networkx/drawing/nx_pylab.py", line 249, in networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx

    AttributeError: module 'matplotlib.cbook' has no attribute 'is_numlike'
```
