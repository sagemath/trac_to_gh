Targetting OpenBSD 6.6+ with clang 8 and (perhaps) flang.

Many packages work out of the box, some packages are available from OpenBSD ports.

Install flang, git, gtar, gmake, gpatch, gmp, xz, yasm, zeromq, zlib, sqlite, pkg-config, python3.7, ncurses, boost, bzip2, curl,
ecm, freetype, iconv, libffi, libgd, libpng, pcre.
(this list is not checked atm).
  
For sanity (some of these compatibility issues probably can be fixed, but it's time-consuming for questionable gain), create and put to the PATH symlinks
`tar -> gtar`, `make -> gmake`, `patch -> gpatch`. I am sticking with native shell (ksh), and it appears to work well (some bashisms are dealt with on ##29345) - Fortran (scipy) is the sticking point.




Depends on #29345

On FreeBSD gfortran is not that bad:

We had some problems (See https://wiki.freebsd.org/libgcc%20problem?highlight=%28fortran%29 ), but they have been solved.

Making it easy to set up the development environment should be one of the first steps, not an afterthought when the porting is "complete". This will enable other Sage developers to help with that platform.

one way to test on openbsd and freebsd would be to use 
https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/compatibility.md

of course it's yet another slightly different yaml:
https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/#how-jobs-are-submitted

(although it does not look crazy, and it's well-supported)
