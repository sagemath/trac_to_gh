This ticket aims to improve the interface connecting the Kenzo Program (https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/) and [SageMath](SageMath) (see ticket #27880 for an updated version of the interface).

In order to use Kenzo functionalities directly as methods of Sage objects, the module `Simplicial sets` can be modified to, once a simplicial set in Sage is constructed, create its analogous Kenzo simplicial set (whenever it is possible).

This belongs to the GSoC 2020 [Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4580455350796288) by Juli√°n Cuevas-Rozo, mentored by Miguel Marco.

```

+    max_dim_kenzo = ecl_eval("+maximal-dimension+").python()
+    if kenzo_is_present and kenzo_repr:
+        if n < max_dim_kenzo:
+            setattr(result, '_kenzo_repr', kenzo.Sphere(n))

```

If we are over the maximal kenzo dimension, we should just not use the kenzo representation, instead of raising an error. It doesn't make sense that adding kenzo might mean to lose a functionality.
