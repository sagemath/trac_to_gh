Our `distclean` doesn't remove `./configure`, neither should it ihmo. Distclean should remove whatever configure output there is, but it should keep the actual configure script which would go into a proper tarball.

OK, deletion should be done by `bootstrap-clean`, not `misc-clean`. My bad.

However, note that bootstrap is the correct build phase for making these files. This build phase, after all,  prepares `src` for `sdist`, the distribution for dist and for configure.
