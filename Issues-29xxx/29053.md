gives `apt-get install` and `yum install` command lines to install system packages that will be recognized by `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-configure.m4`.

Several packages are missing, see comments in
https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/27824/Dockerfile-ubuntu-minimal

This ticket puts this information on a per-package basis into `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/debian.txt`, `.../fedora.txt`, `.../arch.txt` for the following purposes:
- `sage -info SPKG` prints out this information.
- Provide a `tox.ini` that generates and runs `Dockerfile`s that test the installation on various systems. Example (running 3 builds in parallel):
   {{{
   $ tox -p auto -e archlinux-latest,ubuntu-focal-minimal,debian-buster-maximal
â ¸
   }}}

Incidental change on this ticket:
- Mark `gfortran` as a `type=standard` package. It is a prereq of standard package `numpy`. Its status as a `type=optional` package predates the clarifications brought by the development of the `spkg-configure.m4` mechanism (#27330).

---

Possible follow-up and related tickets:
- #29087 - Add a [GitHub](GitHub) workflow that runs this automatically, with many parallel jobs.
- Also the `apt-cyg` command lines at https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/Cygwin64Port could be generated in the same way.
- #26964: Aggregate and format it (during `./bootstrap`) to produce the command lines shown in the manual. This ticket already prepares it by moving these command lines into separate `.txt` files.
- #29041: at `./bootstrap` time, generate `src/requirements.txt`, `src/constraints.txt`, `src/setup.cfg` `[install_requires]` from `build/pkgs`
- #28745: Add `SAGE_ROOT/environment.yml` for `conda env create -f`.
- Add to tox.ini a conda run (either with a fresh environment or fresh conda install) without docker - to test with macOS conda
- Add to tox.ini a homebrew run (with a fresh install not in /usr/local)

The commit message already says:

```
â97b09de	Make gfortran a standard package - it is a prereq of standard package numpy
```
> I guess it was `optional` just as it predated the `spkg-configure.m4` machinery, and it was not fixed then, right?

Thank you! That helped.
But now (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/412042067), still in the python3 build, I am hitting again #29012:

The cygwin ticket is #29106 (Add cygwin package information). It would be great if also corresponding CI scripts could be added, to help elevate the cygwin platform to a first class target for sage.

Yes, as of #26964, these files are being generated by `bootstrap` and are not sources in the git tree any more.

Distributors should build either from a bootstrapped source tree or from a sagelib sdist (see  ticket #21516 - Fix sagelib sdist (src/setup.py sdist); which needs help).

> I am thinking of removing the installation instruction from sage-on-gentoo 


Yes, there's no point in shipping the installation manual with a distribution package.
