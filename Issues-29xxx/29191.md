Keywords: autocompletion, jedi, cython

Working with some custom modules that use cython, Sage crashes. Tracking it down, it appears that the source of the problem lies in the changes introduced in #24681.

The Jedi code tries to call `get_source()` and fails terribly because of that. I understand that #24681 tried to solve a problem, but the one it causes is much worse.

This is running Arch Linux with package sagemath 9.0-12, currently (2020/03/30) up to date.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29428

I uninstalled my extensions and it seems that the problem persists. Here is a MNWE:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: Et = E.tate_curve(11)
sage: Et.<TAB>
```

After this, nothing shows up. After a couple of seconds, Sage crashes. I attached the crash report.

I just installed IPython 7.13 and Jedi 0.17.0, and I don't see this problem. I'm still working out the kinks with the IPython installation, and in particular, the preparser seems to be broken: I get

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')

We had a similar problem with polymake/jupymake. Tab completion in IPython runs in a separate thread. This can break packages that are not prepared for threaded operation.

I can confirm that this is fixed with jedi 0.17, specifically https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/commit/e1425de8a437100601f312840d57cc0d4a10e264

So I guess this can be closed, since 0.16 will never be used in Sage.
