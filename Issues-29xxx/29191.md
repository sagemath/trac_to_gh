Many polytopal constructions are purely combinatorial and it should therefore be possible to do them just with `CombinatorialPolyhedron`. We collect them here:

- #29190: polar/dual,
- product,
- join,
- face truncation,
- face stacking,
- lawrence extension,
- lawrence polytope,
- #30440: pyramid,
- bipyramid,
- prism,
- truncation,
- face as polyhedron,
- P/face (coface as polyhedron),
- given two faces F < G, obtain the interval [F,G] as polyhedron.

Some of them take some optional parameters... So each case might involve some intricate things to do, but yeah, I guess it would be great to speed things up using combin. polyhedra...

Well, I don't know about whether this will speed things up in general. But lets say you really care about the combinatorics of the faces of a polyhedron. Then you want to avoid constructing a geometric object every time.

However, this is really not a priority for me, so it will take time.
