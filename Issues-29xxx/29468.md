The `forward_map` and `reverse_map` in `sage/rings/qqbar_decorators.py` do not currently handle polynomial sequences. Because of that, the call to `groebner_basis` in a polynomial ring over `QQbar` only returns a list, not a `PolynomialSequence`, which can be unexpected.

```
sage: J = QQbar['x,y'].ideal('x^2 - y')
sage: type(J.groebner_basis())
<class 'list'>
```

The decorator should handle polynomial sequences and should in particular preserve properties such as immutability.

Thank you for working on this. I have made a few more small changes.

The immutability is now checked and preserved via `is_immutable()`. The constructor for polynomial sequences has additional arguments like `cr` and `cr_str`, but these are only syntatic and cannot be checked easily, so I think for now it is not that important to preserve these. In the long run, we might add a `.map()` method to sequences that retains these options, but we do not need to do this on this ticket.

Moreover, I have removed the handling of `Sequence` in favour of `PolynomialSequence`, as a sequence of polynomials over `QQbar` will always be a `PolynomialSequence`. I have also added another test case.

Do you agree with the changes?
