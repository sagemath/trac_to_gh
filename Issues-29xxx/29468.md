Keywords: qqbar, beginner

The `forward_map` and `reverse_map` in `sage/rings/qqbar_decorators.py` do not currently handle polynomial sequences. Because of that, the call to `groebner_basis` in a polynomial ring over `QQbar` only returns a list, not a `PolynomialSequence`, which can be unexpected.

```
sage: J = QQbar['x,y'].ideal('x^2 - y')
sage: type(J.groebner_basis())
<class 'list'>
```

The decorator should handle polynomial sequences and should in particular preserve properties such as immutability.

I think it will suffice to modify the definitions of `forward_map` and `reverse_map` by adding `elif` clauses to deal with items that are a `PolynomialSequence` or a `Sequence`.

I attempted to handle `Sequence`s and `PolynomialSequence`s, but I'm not exactly sure how to test things like preserving immutability. Let me know if my small test is not enough or if there is some other problem.

Thank you for working on this. I have made a few more small changes.

The immutability is now checked and preserved via `is_immutable()`. The constructor for polynomial sequences has additional arguments like `cr` and `cr_str`, but these are only syntatic and cannot be checked easily, so I think for now it is not that important to preserve these. In the long run, we might add a `.map()` method to sequences that retains these options, but we do not need to do this on this ticket.

Moreover, I have removed the handling of `Sequence` in favour of `PolynomialSequence`, as a sequence of polynomials over `QQbar` will always be a `PolynomialSequence`. I have also added another test case.

Do you agree with the changes?
