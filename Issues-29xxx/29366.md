not sure there is much on Sage's side that can be done - apart from keeping correct lists of packages to install.

Looks like Arch's ntl is not accepted because it is built with threads, which in turn causes all its reverse dependencies to be compiled. Other packages (fplll, ecm) are simply not installed on the build machine.

Right, this build is using #29339 - Fix NTL spkg-configure.m4 so it rejects NTLs built with NTL_THREADS

> Other packages (fplll, ecm) are simply not installed on the build machine.


OK, this means we need to add `arch.txt` files for these packages

I believe that I was able to use Arch's NTL in builds few betas ago.
This again points at #29339 as being too drastic in its approach.

Note that the packages `pari-seadata` and `pari-seadata-small` conflict.

After removing the pkgconfig file of givaro in `/usr/local` (my bad) and installing the three pari packages (`pari-seadata`, `pari-galpol`, `pari-elldata`), everything is now taken from the system! Thanks.

Please don't. AUR is unsupported, user generated content. There's no guarantee that it couldn't be replaced with broken or even malicious content at any time.

If necessary, I could move these packages to the binary repos. But I don't really see the need to check for those at build time, at least on Arch, given that they can be installed by the user at any time after Sage install.

Thanks very much, that's great.

`configure` now finds the packages!
