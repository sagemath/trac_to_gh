Looks like Arch's ntl is not accepted because it is built with threads, which in turn causes all its reverse dependencies to be compiled. Other packages (fplll, ecm) are simply not installed on the build machine.

Right, this build is using #29339 - Fix NTL spkg-configure.m4 so it rejects NTLs built with NTL_THREADS

> Other packages (fplll, ecm) are simply not installed on the build machine.

OK, this means we need to add `arch.txt` files for these packages

I believe that I was able to use Arch's NTL in builds few betas ago.
This again points at #29339 as being too drastic in its approach.

pacman cannot install packages from AUR, they need to be built from source:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages

(in case of these packages "building" is instant though, it just needs different commands to be run)

Yes, it'd be possible to script this, so these packages need to at least be tagged somehow.

so the script can first install yay, and then use it for the rest.

Please don't. AUR is unsupported, user generated content. There's no guarantee that it couldn't be replaced with broken or even malicious content at any time.

If necessary, I could move these packages to the binary repos. But I don't really see the need to check for those at build time, at least on Arch, given that they can be installed by the user at any time after Sage install.

Thanks very much, that's great.

`configure` now finds the packages!

```
tox -e docker-archlinux-latest-standard -- base-toolchain
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG pari...
checking installing gmp/mpir or readline? ... no
checking installing PARI/GP packages? ... checking for gp... /usr/sbin/gp
checking for gphelp... /usr/sbin/gphelp
checking whether gphelp has access to the documentation... yes
checking is pari_elldata installed? ... yes
checking is pari_galdata installed? ... yes
checking is pari_galpol installed? ... yes
checking is pari_seadata installed? ... yes
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG pari
using pari/gp from the system
```

Needs review.
