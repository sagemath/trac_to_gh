# Issue 29500: Install all Python packages via pip wheel (or setup.py bdist_wheel), store wheels in $SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels

Our current version of pip already tries to install packages via `bdist_wheel`. 

In this ticket, we break the build process into these steps by modifying `sdh_pip_install`:

1. Build the wheel explicitly using `pip wheel --no-binary :all: --no-build-isolation -w "$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS"` (or `setup.py bdist_wheel`), which stores the wheel in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS=$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`.

2. Then install the wheel.

The wheels in `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` persist after the completed build. We manage them using the `DESTDIR` staging mechanism -- there will be exactly 1 wheel for each installed package (and removing a package removes the wheel). Example (after rebuilding a few packages on this branch):

```
$ ls -l local/var/lib/sage/wheels/
...
-rw-r--r--  1 mkoeppe  staff    545293 Sep  8 12:44 Pillow-7.2.0-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
-rw-r--r--  1 mkoeppe  staff   4573510 Sep  8 12:06 numpy-1.19.1-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
-rw-r--r--  1 mkoeppe  staff      2237 Sep  8 12:44 sage_conf-9.2b12-py3-none-any.whl
-rw-r--r--  1 mkoeppe  staff  17981103 Sep  8 12:59 scipy-1.5.2-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
```

Users can create virtual environments and install the wheels built by the Sage distribution into them, using standard tools such as `pip install --find-links`.

- Example:

    {{{
$ python3 -m venv some-venv
$ cd some-venv/
$ bin/pip3 install -v --no-index --find-links=../local/var/lib/sage/wheels/ Pillow    
      }}}
- In follow-up ticket #30527, we create a PEP 503 simple repository for the wheels built during installation, which enables more convenient installation options for users.


In this ticket, we keep using the `DESTDIR` staging mechanism also for the installation of the package from the wheel. 

- In a follow-up ticket, we can change this -- to remove the problems described in #29585 -- by just holding the pip lock (if it is at all still necessary after the major pip upgrades in the 9.2 series) during the wheel installation (step 2).

Would that be `gambit`, `numpy` and `pillow`?

And is this how to find them?

```
$ git grep "setup.py" build/pkgs
```

I did this to emphasize the analogy to `sage-pip-install`.

> - This function should be documented in `developer/packaging.rst`.


Good idea, will do.

> - Does `sage-pip-uninstall` leave the old wheels lying around?


`sage-pip-uninstall` is not really used for regular uninstalls. Rather, it "force-uninstalls" previously installed versions - in case the site-packages directory was somehow messed up. (This code was previously part of `sage-pip-install`.)

The wheels are installed with the staging mechanism (DESTDIR), which records the installed files. In this way, the `-clean` targets etc. automatically install the wheel.

> - Typo in `sage-pip-uninstall` (copied from `sage-pip-install`): "this command hould use"


Thanks
