```
As a follow-up to #21559 and #30128, we reassign `sage-env-config` from the package `sagelib` to the package `sage_conf`.

(After #22731, `sage-env-config` is no longer required by the `sage` script.)

(This is preparation for allowing installation of sagelib for example in a conda environment without having to run ./configure first - see #28745, #30845.)
