This is my first contribution !
Please forgive my possible clumsiness !

I would like to propose a new function for Sage called "sigma_gauss".
This function would be an extension of the sigma function in number theory, which calculates the sum of the divisors of integers.
The sigma_gauss function would apply to a Gaussian integer.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Zeroth step, read the developer guide : https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/#writing-code-for-sage

First step, make it work for you in a ".py" file and not a ".sage" file.

You will need to add some "import" lines, that you can find using "import_statements" command in sage. In particular

```
sage: import_statements(GaussianIntegers,real,imag)
# ** Warning **: several names for that object: real, real_part
# ** Warning **: several names for that object: imag, imag_part, imaginary
from sage.functions.other import real, imag
from sage.rings.number_field.order import GaussianIntegers
```

Thank you very much chapoton.

I have tried to follow your advice and also the advice given in the link you sent me.

So I modified the Ticket with the new code.
And I enclose a modified "sigma_gauss_function.py" file.
Sorry, I attached the .py file twice, it's useless, but I couldn't remove the second one.

To switch from sage code to python code, I also had to make some other changes.
