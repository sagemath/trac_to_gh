When running the configure script, `--enable-foo` and `--disable-foo` should be used to control the installation of optional packages. 

**Original wishlist item:**

With respect to the system-package support, this means that `./configure` should not try to find any optional packages that I don't want, and it shouldn't tell me to install them. For example,

```
$ ./configure
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gp2c...
checking installing pari? ... no
checking for gp2c... no
configure: using pari/gp from the system, but building gp2c
configure: one might prefer to install a system-wide gp2c, instead
configure: and re-run configure.
configure: gp prefix is /usr 
configure: pari.cfg is /usr/share/pari/pari.cfg 
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG gp2c
using Sage's gp2c SPKG
...
gp2c-0.0.10.p0:                              no suitable system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-gp2c" to install
...
configure: Hint: The following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:
configure:   cbc gp2c libsemigroups
checking for the package system in use... gentoo
configure: Hint: Installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ # install the following packages: sci-mathematics/gp2c
```

I guess this is partly due to the default of `if_installed` for `--enable-foo` (which I think is a bad default, but that's another matter), but the same thing happens if I explicitly pass `--disable-gp2c`.


**In this ticket, as a milder change,** we show the list of system packages corresponding to non-enabled optional packages separately.

To test this branch, remember to use `./bootstrap` before `./configure`.

Critical for Sage 9.3 because there is evidence that users get concerned when too many packages are suggested to be installed.

To clarify, they are not "enabled". But the hints certainly make no distinction between enabled and non-enabled packages.

This ticket overlaps with #29363 - "At the end of configure, indicate which optional/experimental packages are configured to be installed". Help on this is very welcome!

Yes, the fact that an existing installation in SAGE_LOCAL influences configure's defaults is, of course, a quirk of Sage.
We should not change this because it has a long tradition; but it would be good to have an additional configure option to disable it and obtain more standard configure behavior.

Testing for the system packages, on the other hand, is a bit trickier because they might be dependencies of an enabled optional package.
