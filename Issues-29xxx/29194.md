Add to Sage the ability to produce interactive 3D animations that can be explored by translating, rotating, and zooming as the animation progresses. Previously, an animation would need to be re-generated each time a different viewpoint was desired.

To that end, this ticket implements the following:

1. an `.interactive()` method on existing `Animation` objects that produces a new 3D graphics object containing all of the original frames of animation with additional animation metadata (keyframe assignments) attached that a supported viewer could use to depict the animation.

2. changes to the Three.js viewer to support keyframe animation of points, lines, texts, and surfaces when animation metadata is present including optional graphical controls allowing the user to play/pause, adjust playback position, control playback speed, and toggle looping.

3. support for saving a 3D graphics object directly to an HTML file that uses the Three.js viewer, bypassing the need to open it in a browser first and use the "Save as HTML" menu option.

4. support for saving an animation to an HTML file using features 1 and 3 listed above.

I opted not to implement persisting the animation state at this time. 

Since the template is being used elsewhere, I went ahead and broke the animation javascript and CSS out into separate files in this initial iteration. The changes to the template file are now quite minimal, and I hope that makes porting future changes to it between Sage and other projects easier.

With the feature work complete, I'll move on to documentation and tests. One thing I've encountered so far is that the `.. PLOT::` directive doesn't seem to work with Three.js plots. I'm curious if this is a problem in my installation of Sage or if it's a known issue. I noticed that the documentation for the Three.js viewer (`src/doc/en/reference/plot3d/threejs.rst`) embeds pre-generated HTML files so perhaps that's the direction I should go as well?

We won't have any control over the `sage -b` behavior since our files are not part of the core of Sage. `make build` or manually copying are the options.

Hello, I hope this finds you well. I apologize for the delay in getting this ticket up for review, but I just didn't have a good feeling about the branch as it was. 

After using it for a couple months, I've found the performance when using multiple animated variables to be quite wanting, as you'd expect from the exponential nature of adding new dimensions to the array of keyframes. Memory use and file size gets very large very quickly, especially when each frame itself is complex or if you've got several of them in the same notebook. Reducing the number of keyframes per variable helps, but having only a handful of frames makes noticing higher frequency stuff going on impossible. I consistently found myself using the `interact` command in the Jupyter notebook to control those extra variables instead.

I've pushed a new version of the branch for your review that drops support for multiple animated variables. A lot of the complexity of the old branch came from supporting them, so the new one is much simpler. It uses Three.js's built-in animation system now instead of a custom one, and it is invoked from the existing animation functionality users may already be familiar with: instead of calling an animation's `gif` or `apng` method, you call `interactive`. The name `interactive` was chosen instead of `threejs` to allow the possibility of other viewers supporting this in the future.

I've updated [https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/](https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/) with an example animated plot from the new branch.

Please let me know if you'd still prefer the older version. I believe the new one to be superior, but I'll try to keep up with and support either one going forward.

Thanks!

Joshua

Hi Paul,

I somewhat agree about the slider at the top, but I'm pondering future work where the animations aren't all or shouldn't necessarily all be discrete, in which case a way to navigate continuously would be helpful. For example: when just spinning an object about an axis there's no reason it shouldn't be transformed as continuously as the highest frame-rate the user/browser allows. Ideally, I'm imagining something like:

```python
dodecahedron().rotateX(pi, duration=10).then().rotateY(-pi, duration=10)
```

The discrete frame-by-frame was a nice starting point, though, since that's what users currently do for 2D animations, and so only a small change is required: `animate(frames).interactive()` instead of, for example, `animate(frames).apng()`.

Perhaps it's jumping the gun a bit, though it does also serve to show the animation progress. May come in handy for seamlessly looped animations to tell when one period ended and another began without a sharp cut as a visual cue.

I used the hollow arrows for decrease speed instead of the reverse arrow since I didn't want the user to think it was a rewind button. I'm not particularly happy with the icons for the speed buttons, but I couldn't find anything in their icon set that seemed to fit better, and I'm not much of a graphics artist I fear. 

Do you think chevrons instead of triangle arrows would convey the meaning better? `>` for slow down and `>>>` for speed up? That geometry doesn't seem too complicated so I'd probably be able to design it. Not up to Google's standards, I'm sure :)

I understand it's a good bit of code to look through, so no worries.

Thanks!

-Moving conversation from #29192, where I mentioned that I've been working on adding support for three.js-based interactive 3D animated plots to Sage.
+Add to Sage the ability to produce interactive 3D animations that can be explored by translating, rotating, and zooming as the animation progresses. Previously, an animation would need to be re-generated each time a different viewpoint was desired.
 
-The current state of the work can be found at:
+To that end, this ticket implements the following:
 
-    https://gitlab.com/jcamp0x2a/sage/-/tree/threejs-animate
+1. an `.interactive()` method on existing `Animation` objects that produces a new 3D graphics object containing all of the original frames of animation with additional animation metadata (keyframe assignments) attached that a supported viewer could use to depict the animation.
 
-...and some examples of the plots generated so far and how the animation functionality is invoked:
+2. changes to the Three.js viewer to support keyframe animation of points, lines, texts, and surfaces when animation metadata is present including optional graphical controls allowing the user to play/pause, adjust playback position, control playback speed, and toggle looping.
 
-    https://jcamp0x2a.github.io/threejs-animation-example/
+3. support for saving a 3D graphics object directly to an HTML file that uses the Three.js viewer, bypassing the need to open it in a browser first and use the "Save as HTML" menu option.
 
-Tasks remaining before I'd be comfortable making a merge request:
+4. support for saving an animation to an HTML file using features 1 and 3 listed above.
 
-- Persist animation state across viewings. (maybe)
-
-- Better handling of variable name collisions. If both plot G1 and G2 use an animation variable `x`, rather than overwriting one of them when summing G1 + G2, rename one of them instead. `x`, `x′`, `x″`, etc.
-
-- Pause the render loop when no variable is being animated. (energy / battery life)
-
-- Partition scene objects into keyframe groups whose visibility can be toggled on/off in one assignment every frame vs. iterating over every scene object every frame.
-
-- Come up with several animated plots to embed in the documentation showing off a wide variety of plots being animated: simple shapes, parametric curves/surfaces, implicit surfaces, surfaces of revolution, scatter plots, vector fields, etc.
-
-- Tests!
-
-Possible future work:
-
-- Break animation javascript code off into a separate file that's only included when the plot contains animation. (smaller file size, less bandwidth, more modular)
-
-- Interpolate/blend/morph between keyframes in order to improve the appearance of the animations, and allow it to be disabled. Some ideas include:
-  - Fade keyframes in and out (via object opacity).
-  - Identify corresponding objects between frames and interpolate their transforms and/or geometries.
-  - Image-based blending: render the two keyframes you're between (for N variables, the min/max corners of the N-box) then blend them while rendering to a textured screen-size quad.
-
-- Performance improvements due to the # of objects animation may add to the scene: 
-  - Use Buffer Geometry instead of Geometry.
-  - Merge identical objects and use instanced rendering.
-  - Merge geometries that share a material and use range-restricted draws.
