This is a followup to #29490.

We now add code rejecting Brial 1.2.5 - provided it can
be recognised from `VERSION` macro in `polybory/config.h` header.
This identifies standard Brial on Fedora 30 (and possibly elsewhere, but tough luck then).

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/125137242

It rejects brial on fedora 30 and 31 and ubuntu eoan (all use Brial 1.2.5).

It doesn't reject Brial 1.2.4 on debian buster and Brial 1.2.7 on ubuntu focal.
