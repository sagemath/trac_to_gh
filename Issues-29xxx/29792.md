This is a followup to #29490.

We now add code rejecting Brial 1.2.5 - provided it can
be recognised from `VERSION` macro in `polybory/config.h` header.
This identifies standard Brial on Fedora 30 (and possibly elsewhere, but tough luck then).

It rejects brial on fedora 30 and 31 and ubuntu eoan (all use Brial 1.2.5).

It doesn't reject Brial 1.2.4 on debian buster and Brial 1.2.7 on ubuntu focal.
