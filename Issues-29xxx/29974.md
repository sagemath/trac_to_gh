Part of #29935.

This ticket makes

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=n src/sage/combinat/
```
pass for `n` more general than just `0`.

See also:
- #30186 containment check for standard bracketed Lyndon words does not work.

Along the way we fix a tiny but annoying bug, where random derangements could fail.

That was because `randint(0, n)` has range `range(0, n + 1)`,
which had caused confusion.
