This ticket renames `affine_hull` of `Polyhedron_base` to `affine_hull_projection` and adds a deprecation warning.

Before, this function was hard to recognize, as by the name one expected to obtain the affine hull and not the polyhedron projected into it.

Also this ticket makes use of #28724 to simplify construction: We determine a transformation matrix `A` and a vector `b` and basically return `A*P - b`, where `P` is the polyhedron.

* In `polyhedra_quickref.rst`:

```diff
-    :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.affine_hull_projection` | constructs an affinely equivalent full dimensional polyhedra
+    :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.affine_hull_projection` | constructs an affinely equivalent full-dimensional polyhedron
```

* Make the second paragraph in the docstring look like a one paragraph.
* In the "OUTPUT" section:

```diff
-        A full-dimensional polyhedron or a linear transformation,
+        A full-dimensional polyhedron or an affine transformation,
        depending on the parameter ``as_affine_map``.
```
* Remove the following line from "TODO" section:

```diff
-            - allow to return ``as_affine_map=True`` for default setting
```
* The new name `affine_hull_projection` is definitively better than the old name, but I am not sure if this is the best name. How about `full_dimensional_copy`? I am also not sure about this suggestion. So maybe we need another opinion.
