I added a `# random` tag to the example that failed in [comment:1](#comment:1) (and also added a basic doctest `S.random_element() in S` to the `random_element()` method of `FiniteEnumeratedSet` ). I tried a few various seeds and have not seen any other doctest failures.

After submitting the PR, I noticed that #29935 suggests `S.random_element().parent() is S` as a doctest, but I don't think that will work here:

```
sage: S = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])                                                   
sage: a = S.random_element()                                                             
sage: a

sage: a.parent()                                                                         
Integer Ring
sage: S.random_element().parent() is S                                                   
False
```
