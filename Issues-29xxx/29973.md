After submitting the PR, I noticed that #29935 suggests `S.random_element().parent() is S` as a doctest, but I don't think that will work here:

```
sage: S = FiniteEnumeratedSet([1,2,3])                                                   
sage: a = S.random_element()                                                             
sage: a                                                                                  
2
sage: a.parent()                                                                         
Integer Ring
sage: S.random_element().parent() is S                                                   
False
```
