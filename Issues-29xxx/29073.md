Currently the Gale transform for `RDF` does not work

```
sage: P = polytopes.icosahedron(exact=False)
sage: sum(P.gale_transform())
(1.3819660112000005, -1.3819660112000005, 0.3819660112000003, -1.3819660112000005, -9.43689570931383e-16, 1.6653345369377348e-16, -6.661338147750939e-16, 0.0)
```

but the sum should be close to zero. This is of course only an indication that something goes terribly wrong. For #29065, I wanted to add a doctest recovering an inexact polyhedron from the gale diagram, but it simply does not work.

The problem is quite simple. The method `right_kernel` for matrices, should just not be used, as it echolonizes the kernel. This is just something, one shouldn't do for inexact rings. The method `right_kernel_matrix(basis=computed)` gives a much more useful matrix.

We also leave a note in `left_kernel`, `right_kernel`, and `right_kernel_matrix` to indicate this problem.
