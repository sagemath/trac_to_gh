This doctest was mentioned before in #29317 with a suggestion for a fix.

Failed example:
    res = p.solve()
Expected:
          0: obj = ...
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```

The problem is that we have doctests that rely on error-recovery behavior added by a custom patch [ticket:20710#comment:18],
which wasn't accepted by upstream. (The doctest for the patch was added in #20832.)

The present ticket fixes the failures by 
* adding explicit input validation in several functions in the Cython wrappers so that the GLPK error handler is not reached;
* changing the default optimization mode from `glp_intopt` to `glp_simplex_then_intopt`, which is more robust;
* disabling the test for the error-recovery behavior, which provokes a crash with unpatched GLPK.

What we could do is add a new testing flag style `# optional - sage-glpk` (and for any other package).
This would than only be tested when sage build it's own version of the package.

This could also be used for #29092 and make the tests nicer for #29417.

Given that the doctest in `sage/libs/glpk/error.pyx` has to go to great lengths to crash glpk...

```
sage: cython('''
....: # distutils: libraries = glpk z gmp
....: from cysignals.signals cimport sig_on, sig_off
....: from sage.libs.glpk.env cimport glp_term_out
....:
....: sig_on()
....: glp_term_out(12345)  # invalid value
....: sig_off()
....: ''')
Traceback (most recent call last):
```

what sort of real problems are we expecting this to catch during normal sage usage? Is there any place that a user passes data directly to glpk that we can't inspect/preprocess first, to ensure that it's correct? If not, maybe we should just crash sage when glpk crashes and drop the patch, because any crash of glpk is a low-level sage programming error.

For example, one of the GLPK crashes that we catch and throw is,

```
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver="GLPK")
sage: p.variable_upper_bound(2)
...
GLPKError: glp_get_col_ub: j = 3; column number out of range
```

The problem? We assume that the index `2` was valid, and use GLPK crashing as an indication that it isn't. Instead, we should just check that the index is valid (i.e. use the API correctly):

```
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver="GLPK")
sage: p.ncols()
0
sage: p.add_variable()
0
sage: p.add_variable()
1
sage: p.add_variable()
2
sage: p.ncols()
3
sage: p.variable_upper_bound(2)
<no crash>
```

Tada, one down.

Running `git grep GLPKError` shows all of the instances that we need to worry about. And all except two look like missing bounds checks that can be turned into a`ValueError`.

That leaves:

```
.. WARNING::

    Sage uses GLPK's ``glp_intopt`` to find solutions.
    This routine sometimes FAILS CATASTROPHICALLY
    when given a system it cannot solve. (:trac:`12309`.)
    Here, "catastrophic" can mean either "infinite loop" or
    segmentation fault. Upstream considers this behavior
    "essentially innate" to their design, and suggests
    preprocessing it with ``glp_simplex`` first.
    Thus, if you suspect that your system is infeasible,
    set the ``preprocessing`` option first.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "GLPK")
    sage: v = lp.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
    sage: lp.add_constraint(v[1] +v[2] -2.0 *v[3], max=-1.0)
    sage: lp.add_constraint(v[0] -4.0/3 *v[1] +1.0/3 *v[2], max=-1.0/3)
    sage: lp.add_constraint(v[0] +0.5 *v[1] -0.5 *v[2] +0.25 *v[3], max=-0.25)
    sage: lp.solve()
    0.0
    sage: lp.add_constraint(v[0] +4.0 *v[1] -v[2] +v[3], max=-1.0)
    sage: lp.solve()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    GLPKError: Assertion failed: ...
    sage: lp.solver_parameter("simplex_or_intopt", "simplex_then_intopt")
    sage: lp.solve()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MIPSolverException: GLPK: Problem has no feasible solution
```

I've included the **WARNING** block from just prior to the doctest, because it tells us how to fix this problem. Instead of an unsafe default, we should enable preprocessing but let the user disable it if he thinks he knows what he's doing (and is willing to crash sage if he's wrong).

And the other instance:

```
cpdef eval_tab_row(self, int k):
    r"""
    Computes a row of the current simplex tableau.
    ...
    try:
        sig_on()            # to catch GLPKError
        i = glp_eval_tab_row(self.lp, k + 1, c_indices, c_values)
        sig_off()
    except GLPKError:
        raise MIPSolverException('GLPK: basis factorization does not exist; or variable must be basic')
```

I haven't computed a tableau in about a decade. Is that something we can check before we call `glp_eval_tab_row()`?

Yup. I'm in the process of fixing all of these. From the GLPK docs:

**Synopsis**:
  int glp_bf_exists(glp_prob *P);
**Comments**:
... So before calling any API routine, which uses the basis factorization, the application program must make sure (using the routine `glp_bf_exists`) that the factorization exists and therefore available for computations.

Well we invented the `GLPKError`. I would propose leaving `GLPKError` with a deprecation warning and also having it inherit from `ValueError`.

This way `except GLPKError` would still work. `except MIPSolverException` would sometimes not work anymore without a proper warning and the user will have to find out that this is sometimes a `ValueError` now.

But it would be worth checking (or commenting on, if you have checked already) whether the differences to other backends are decreased or increased by this change.  

A while back when I was working on cleaning up these backends, I introduced a number of `_test...` methods in `GenericBackend` to make sure that the API is actually the same; more could be added.

... and of course this is a rather unfortunate design for a library, and terrible for development in particular in an interactive environment. Basically, when working on new interfacing code, make one mistake and your session is killed.

I guess that there was hope at the time that the patch could be upstreamed, but of course now we just have to accept that GLPK is a stable target. So we now simply have to accept that we have to duplicate all input validation checks that GLPK is already doing. Fine.

> Is there any place that a user passes data directly to glpk that we can't inspect/preprocess first, to ensure that it's correct? 


I don't know the answer to this question.

> If not, maybe we should just crash sage when glpk crashes and drop the patch, because any crash of glpk is a low-level sage programming error.


Well, I think the error recovery patch is still valuable for sage-the-distribution, so I don't think it should be removed. It adds value for Sage developers because it makes interactive development with the GLPK API simpler.

I considered this when fixing all of the methods that segfault. I had two choices in most cases: return garbage, or throw an error. For example,

```
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver="PPL")
sage: p.row(12)
...
IndexError: list index out of range

sage: p = get_solver(solver="CVXOPT")
sage: p.row(12)
([], [])
```

That `IndexError` is an implementation detail since it tries to index a member variable list. Nothing is documented. But eliminating the option to segfault makes it more consistent, I guess? The methods should all be made to agree, of course, and the behavior documented. Another place I noticed some incongruity is that every backend returns garbage for the is-variable-foo methods:

```
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver="PPL")
sage: p.is_variable_binary(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_integer(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_continuous(12)
True
sage: p = get_solver(solver="CVXOPT")
sage: p.is_variable_binary(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_integer(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_continuous(12)
True
sage: p = get_solver(solver="GLPK")
sage: p.is_variable_binary(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_integer(12)
False
sage: p.is_variable_continuous(12)
False
```

As the last line shows, I opted for the garbage `False` that is more intuitive to me than garbage `True`. But if I were doing it from scratch, that would also be a (documented in the interface) error.

If we keep the patch and ever take advantage of it, we'll be right back where we started, won't we?

The upstream maintainers and documentation have been pretty clear that you need to check the parameters you pass to GLPK. That's just the way the API works, and it really wasn't very much trouble to do. And so long as we do it, there's no urgent need for the error-recovery patch, because errors will never happen. The only real exception to my last statement is when you have an infeasible problem, ignore the warning, and set the method to `intopt_only` to skip the feasibility check performed by the continuous simplex solver. It's nice that we provide low-level access to that ability for people who really need it, but it's just that: low level access that you shouldn't use without reading the documentation and understanding what it does.

To summarize:

* the patch is only helpful in a rare case (or when we use the API wrong)
* ...and if you ignore a warning
* ...and are wrong about how feasible your problem is
* we can't take advantage of the patch in sagelib without breaking distros
* the upstream developers have said "don't do that" multiple times

Even if we left it as "something for other people to use," I think it would be pretty annoying to write some sage code that works on your machine but not on your friend's because he's running debian and their glpk isn't patched.

No, we won't, obviously.

Are we talking about the same thing? I'm assuming that you're talking about the patch that upstream rejected and that I deleted, that resets the error state back to zero. If we keep that patch in sage-the-distribution, and if anyone ever relies on it, we would be back in the situation that prompted this ticket: some behavior depends on the custom patch to work, and it will break on distros that don't carry the patch.

Let's see. 

The doctest failure in `sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend.print_ranges` is solved by your changes using `glp_bf_exists`.

The doctests that relied on the error handler for index bound checking etc. are solved by your additions to the Cython functions.

The doctest for `sage.libs.glpk.error.setup_glpk_error_handler` had become inappropriate now that we can use system GLPKs, so removing the doctest (or marking it "# optional - glpk_error_recovery") is sufficient to fix this doctest failure.
It is not necessary to remove the error recovery feature for that.

I also had to change the default solver method, and remove the doctest that purposely crashed GLPK.

Deleting the tests would have made the errors go away in the first place, but that doesn't solve the underlying problem: there are two fundamentally different behaviors, and you don't know which one you're going to get unless you know what distro your code will be running on (and what `./configure` options will be used to build sage). That problem is less prominent after some of these commits, but still lurking unless we get rid of the custom patch.

If I'm writing a new sage package and if I rely on being able to catch `GLPKError`, then as soon as I send it to someone running Ubuntu, it's going to crash. I'll probably post to the mailing list, be linked to this ticket, and ultimately decide that I should be sanitizing my input before passing it to GLPK for the best results. But then what good has the patch done me, except to waste some time on a false start?

Yes, I know, see my updated description.

It is undefined behavior. We have a patch that makes it less deadly. It's a convenience for developers. I know that it has actually save my time during development (in contrast to the hypothetical developer that you are invoking), and as I have said above, I don't support removing the feature.

In any case, the removal is not necessary for this ticket. It is best to limit the scope of the ticket.

```
+    We install this error handler so that an error does not lead to
+    an immediate error exit of the process.  Instead, we raise a
+    ``GLPKError`` for the convenience of developers.
```

The *sage* process never exited, but the error left GLPK unusable from that point forward -- for example returning nothing instead of solving subsequent problems as in the ticket description. The error handler itself is fine; it's toggling the "there was an error" bit off afterwards that's causing all this trouble.

I still think it's perverse to leave around 150 lines of code with a docstring that says "don't use this," but where we are is not even locally optimal, so let's just do it.
