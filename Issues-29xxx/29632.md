```
The following causes a segmentation fault for the identity morphism of polynomial rings over number fields:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QuadraticField(-1)[]
sage: f = R.hom(R.gens(), R)
sage: f.is_identity()
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```
This does not happen for morphisms that are not the identity.

This bug was introduced between Sage 8.1 and 8.6.

Sounds reasonable, but I prefer `B.coerce(x)` since `_coerce_c` is a remnant of the old coercion model.  Now running tests.
