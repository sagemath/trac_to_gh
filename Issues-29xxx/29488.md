Follow-up from #29052, which removed environment variables only needed at build time of sage-the-distribution from the `sage-env`.

Consequently, the debugging hints displayed by sage-spkg at the end of a failing build should say `sage-buildsh` instead of `sage-sh`.

See also #29045.

Many `spkg-check.in` and `spkg-install.in` files contain

```
if [ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: SAGE_LOCAL undefined - exiting..."
    echo >&2 "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
    exit 1
fi
```
Should these lines just be deleted?
