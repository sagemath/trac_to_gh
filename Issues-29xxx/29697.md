`$SAGE_LOCAL/{include,lib}` are already added to the front of the search paths `CPATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` by `sage-env`.

We remove code that adds another copy. This removes a dependency on `SAGE_LOCAL` during the build of sagelib.

The function `sage_include_directories`, apart from its use by `setup.py`, is also used by `sage.misc.cython.cython`.
