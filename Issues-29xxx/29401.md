Also in the "Generating Dockerfiles" section: I tried

```
$ build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh debian "@(standard|optional)" > ../Dockerfile
$ docker build . -f ../Dockerfile ...
```
so as not to pollute my Sage directory with untracked files, but it didn't work:

```
ERRO[0000] Can't add file /Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/.git/TEMP/rebase-apply/0001 to tar: io: read/write on closed pipe 
ERRO[0000] Can't close tar writer: io: read/write on closed pipe

```
Giving an absolute path didn't help. 

Also, once I get this going, where does the build take place? That is, can I look at the log files without running a second iteration of docker?
