Some people may also complain that some of the lines are longer than 80 characters. I don't care much about this.

I just tried out the instructions for Docker. When I was just starting, `apt-get install ...` wasn't working: I needed to run `apt-get update` first (as in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27273412/cannot-install-packages-inside-docker-ubuntu-image). Should this command be added?

In the "Generating Dockerfiles" section: am I understanding that you don't need to create a new git worktree with this approach? That's not completely clear as written.

Also in the "Generating Dockerfiles" section: I tried

```
$ build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh debian "@(standard|optional)" > ../Dockerfile
$ docker build . -f ../Dockerfile ...
```
so as not to pollute my Sage directory with untracked files, but it didn't work:

```

Giving an absolute path didn't help. 

Also, once I get this going, where does the build take place? That is, can I look at the log files without running a second iteration of docker?

`docker run` does not quite work as shown (I'm trying this on a Debian host). I have

```
$ docker images

```
but

``` 
$ docker run -it   --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/sage ubuntuminimal
Unable to find image 'ubuntuminimal:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for ubuntuminimal, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```
I have to use containter ID:

```
$ docker run -it   --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/sage ee59e71b3721
root@6b44c73a10bb:/#
