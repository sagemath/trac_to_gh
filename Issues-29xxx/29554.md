> configure is now happy with my pari. However there is something that I don't understand in [config.log line 2023](https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/29554/config.log#L2023).  `matpermanent` is not found. Why is there a search for it if it does not matter?


This is normal functioning of `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` macro.

`matpermanent` is used to detect that `libpari` is at least verision 2.11. First, an attempt is made to link without `-lpari`, adn it fails. The next attempt (line 2107), `-lpari` is added, and test passes.
