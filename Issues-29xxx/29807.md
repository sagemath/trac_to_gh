Frédéric, you don't need to use FileSaver at all: just create a link as is done in the Three.js template and click it programmatically.

I tested it and I can save the graph with safari and chrome, and later load the svg file.

However, for a graph like that, the svg is not nice. I don't know how to improve that.

sage: G = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,3)
sage: G.show(method='js', edge_labels=True, link_distance=100)

Indeed, too many years having him walking in front of my office ;)
FYI, he moved to g..... Zurich.

> Maybe this could be fixed by a better transmission of the css style information. I would appreciate help from people that know this better than I do.

I searched a bit, starting from

```
sage: G = digraphs.Path(2)
sage: G.show(method='js', edge_labels=True)  # and save as svg
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: G.add_edges(G.edges())
sage: G.show(method='js', edge_labels=True)    # and save as svg
```
So an arc is turned to a `path` 

```
<path class="link directed" marker-end="url(#directed)" d="M30,654 L2113,654" style="stroke: rgb(170, 170, 170); stroke-width: 4px;"/>
<path class="link directed" marker-end="url(#directed)" d="M30,654Q516.0333333333333,669,1071.5,669Q1626.9666666666667,669,2113,654" style="stroke: rgb(170, 170, 170); stroke-width: 4px;"/>
```
The first one is a straight line, the second a curved one, and it is filled by default :(

From https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathElementImplementationNotes, I understood that adding `fill="none"` to the curved one, we get a nice figure.

So we need to add `<style>.link {fill:none;} </style>` at the right place, that is just before the first `<g>` (for some reason, we have `<g><g>`).

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="2143" height="1308" pointer-events="all"><style>.link {fill:none;}</style><g><g>
```

So adding

```
var bettersource = source.replace("<g>", "<style>.link {fill:none;}</style><g>");
```
should do the job. We will have it twice, but it's safer in case a new version of d3 removes one of the `<g>`.
