Thanks to some other improvements, the spkg-configure check for gp2c can be cleaned up a bit:

* We can use DEPCHECK instead of manually checking if the pari SPKG will be installed
* We don't need to suggest to the user that she install gp2c from the system

And there's one huge annoyance that I need to fix but I'm not sure how yet:

* The `find /usr -name pari.cfg` call takes forever, because it searches through a million files.

Can we collect a list of places that pari.cfg is installed by the pari system package? I think we should just loop through them all. Gentoo is `/usr/share/pari/pari.cfg`, so I have that one. I still need to know where pari.cfg winds up on,

* Debian
* Fedora
* Arch
* Conda
* Homebrew

Then I can turn that `find` into a loop (I know this will be something weird on Conda, the spkg-configure in reality uses a relative path).

Still failing. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/577560337

Really shouldn't be using AC_MSG_ERROR at all here.
If gp2c spkg-configure can't find the needed bits of pari, then we have to build our own pari.

The existing check already fails if it can't find pari.cfg, it just takes longer. We've already decided to use the system pari at this point, and I'm not sure we can retroactively decide not to (what about all of the other packages that have already run DEPCHECK?). In any case, failures should be extremely rare, and when they do happen, we should add the new location to the list rather than silently rebuilding pari for people who probably don't even want gp2c. Related: is there some way to detect if --enable-gp2c was passed? We shouldn't have to run this code at all, by default.

Unfortunately at this point the SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE calls are emitted after the SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_* calls.
This could be changed easily, of course. Related: #29363
