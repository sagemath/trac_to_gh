If you checkout sage on Windows, the line endings are wrong (depending on the core.autocrlf setting).

This PR adds a .gitattributes file which specifies the correct line ending so that simply cloning sage results in the correct line ending for all files. See the following documentation for more information

I think it's better to keep the `--branch master ` in the documentation -- so that it becomes clear for beginners how to select a different branch...

I probably miss something, but what's the purpose of the `--branch master` part? The clone command still fetches all branches so that changing a branch is a matter of `git checkout <branch>`. So why would you want to use the clone with a different branch?

But if you think it would be helpful, I'll readd this of course.

Of course it's redundant but by including it, it is more obvious to beginning users what to change to get the "develop" branch.  At this point they do not necessarily know about git, and I don't think the README is a place to educate them about it.  Think of a user who used to unpack tarballs but is taking a tiny step into the scary git world.
