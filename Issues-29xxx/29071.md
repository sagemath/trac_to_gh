currently openblas's spkg-configure.pc unconditionally makes cblas.pc and lapack.pc copies of openblas.pc, which in some cases if incorrect, e.g. Arch Linux has libcblas linked to libopenblas
and containing stuff missing in libopenblas, resulting in errors.

this has been reported on sage-devel
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/pIOnFyFJMtM/_FbzM2OxCQAJ

So we should make these installations conditional.

Depends on #29051

we can do an `AC_LINK_IFELSE()` test with a subroutine `dgeqef` call,
and try to link it against libopenblas. this would be independent of Fortran compiler.

`local/lib/pkgconfig/` may or may not be present, it depends upon the state of the system.
(e.g. if you did `make distclean` before `./configure` you won't have
`local/` at all)

Now, what happens if you run `make`? Do you still get the same error?

In the above situation, `make` fails at building openblas with the same as usual

good catch - so the gfortran is a dependency here.

But this also applies to many `spkg-configure.m4` tests that use a C++ compiler
to run tests.

I think your issue is caused by the same .pc stale symlinks that are making the build fail with sage's openblas. fflas-ffpack's spkg-install has `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"`, which should return `-lcblas` on Arch, but it is returning `-lopenblas` for you. The only reason I can think of is those symlinks. Can you delete them and try again?

Indeed

```
(sage-sh)$ pkg-config --libs cblas
-lopenblas 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ rm local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc

<div id="comment:41" align="right">comment:41</div>

The fact that LINBOX_BLAS is set to -lcblas on Arch makes fflas-ffpack not detect openblas (since -lcblas doesn't provide openblas_set_num_threads), so it is compiled without openblas optimizations.

To fix this, `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"` should be replaced with ` LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs blas cblas)"` in fflas-ffpack's spkg-install, which would return `-lopenblas -lcblas` on Arch and wouldn't make any difference on systems where openblas provides cblas

Dima, do you want to include this change here or should I open a new ticket?

The above is coherent with the symlinks provided in Sage

Removing the symlinks and setting them according to what is in `/usr/lib` seems to fix the issue

```
$ rm /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/

Please also make sure there is nothing in `src/lib/pkgconfig` before running `./configure`. After running ./configure on Arch it should look like

```
$ ls src/lib/pkgconfig/

```

You could have these stale stuff from older versions of this ticket or even before.

I don't like the idea of requiring a Fortran compiler to even run `./configure` successfully. 

After all, sage-the-distribution has a mechanism to install `gfortran` itself. We shouldn't break that.

As you can see at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/411989461, with this ticket all "minimal" installs fail with `configure: error: in `/sage':

Fixed by `wrap AC_FC_FUNC so that it does not throw an error without Fortran`: [56541ae](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/56541ae443c5cffaf5d943694c37f3b4afb5bca2)

IMHO it's an autoconf bug/feature that `AC_FC_FUNC` errors out without Fortran, while e.g. `AC_FC_FREEFORM` does not.
