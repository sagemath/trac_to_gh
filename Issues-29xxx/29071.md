currently openblas's spkg-configure.pc unconditionally makes cblas.pc and lapack.pc copies of openblas.pc, which in some cases if incorrect, e.g. Arch Linux has libcblas linked to libopenblas
and containing stuff missing in libopenblas, resulting in errors.

this has been reported on sage-devel
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/pIOnFyFJMtM/_FbzM2OxCQAJ

So we should make these installations conditional.

we can do an `AC_LINK_IFELSE()` test with a subroutine `dgeqef` call,
and try to link it against libopenblas. this would be independent of Fortran compiler.

good catch - so the gfortran is a dependency here.

But this also applies to many `spkg-configure.m4` tests that use a C++ compiler

The only reason I can think of is those symlinks. Can you delete them and try again?",

I think your issue is caused by the same .pc stale symlinks that are making the build fail with sage's openblas. fflas-ffpack's spkg-install has `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"`, which should return `-lcblas` on Arch, but it is returning `-lopenblas` for you. The only reason I can think of is those symlinks. Can you delete them and try again?

Indeed

```
(sage-sh)$ pkg-config --libs cblas
-lopenblas 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ rm local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ rm local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ pkg-config --libs cblas
-lcblas 
```
I just relaunched `make` after that...

The above is coherent with the symlinks provided in Sage

```
(sage-sh)$ ls -l local/lib/pkgconfig/ | grep blas

```
But not with what I have in `/usr/lib/pkgconfig/`

```

Removing the symlinks and setting them according to what is in `/usr/lib` seems to fix the issue

```
$ rm /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
```
