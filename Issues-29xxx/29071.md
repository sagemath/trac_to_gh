currently openblas's spkg-configure.pc unconditionally makes cblas.pc and lapack.pc copies of openblas.pc, which in some cases if incorrect, e.g. Arch Linux has libcblas linked to libopenblas
and containing stuff missing in libopenblas, resulting in errors.

this has been reported on sage-devel
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/pIOnFyFJMtM/_FbzM2OxCQAJ

So we should make these installations conditional.

we can do an `AC_LINK_IFELSE()` test with a subroutine `dgeqef` call,
and try to link it against libopenblas. this would be independent of Fortran compiler.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A14):
> When I do `make distclean` it does remove `local` entirely. At which step do you want me to try `rm XXX`?


these `rm` from[comment:11](#comment%3A11) should be run after `./configure` and before `make`, assuming I understand what's going on.

`local/lib/pkgconfig/` may or may not be present, it depends upon the state of the system.
(e.g. if you did `make distclean` before `./configure` you won't have
`local/` at all)

Now, what happens if you run `make`? Do you still get the same error?

good catch - so the gfortran is a dependency here.

But this also applies to many `spkg-configure.m4` tests that use a C++ compiler

by right, C, C++, and Fortran compilers are pre-reqs for many `spkg-configure.m4` tests,
as testing with one compiler and then build another compiler and use it is dodgy.

I think your issue is caused by the same .pc stale symlinks that are making the build fail with sage's openblas. fflas-ffpack's spkg-install has `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"`, which should return `-lcblas` on Arch, but it is returning `-lopenblas` for you. The only reason I can think of is those symlinks. Can you delete them and try again?

Indeed

```
(sage-sh)$ pkg-config --libs cblas
-lopenblas 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ rm local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ rm local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc 
(sage-sh) vincent@mangouste:sage$ pkg-config --libs cblas
-lcblas 
```
I just relaunched `make` after that...

The fact that LINBOX_BLAS is set to -lcblas on Arch makes fflas-ffpack not detect openblas (since -lcblas doesn't provide openblas_set_num_threads), so it is compiled without openblas optimizations.

To fix this, `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"` should be replaced with ` LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs blas cblas)"` in fflas-ffpack's spkg-install, which would return `-lopenblas -lcblas` on Arch and wouldn't make any difference on systems where openblas provides cblas

Dima, do you want to include this change here or should I open a new ticket?

The above is coherent with the symlinks provided in Sage

```
(sage-sh)$ ls -l local/lib/pkgconfig/ | grep blas

But not with what I have in `/usr/lib/pkgconfig/`

Removing the symlinks and setting them according to what is in `/usr/lib` seems to fix the issue

```
$ rm /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
```

Wait, why do you do these:

```
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/

?

This could only break stuff, if you do it after `make distclean`.

After `make distclean`, `./bootstrap`, `./configure` the build still fails at `fflas-ffpack` with the same

```
error: 'openblas_set_num_threads' was not declared in this scope; did you mean 'omp_set_num_threads'?
```
Also the blas symlinks are still pointing to openblas

```
$ ls -l local/lib/pkgconfig/ | grep blas

I don't like the idea of requiring a Fortran compiler to even run `./configure` successfully. 

After all, sage-the-distribution has a mechanism to install `gfortran` itself. We shouldn't break that.

As you can see at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/411989461, with this ticket all "minimal" installs fail with `configure: error: in `/sage':

actually, I don't see the  point of this `if` at all. If we get there then it's already true, as it's inside the check for `gfortran` as a pre-req, in the scope of `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([gfortran], ...)`.
