A change in #28788 (MR38: Fix documentation of spkg-configure.m4 and make output more verbose) made as part of adding documentation seems to have broken gfortran detection.

For example, on `fedora-31-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/449461282?check_suite_focus=true)

```
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG arb
checking for Fortran flag needed to accept free-form source... unknown
configure: Your Fortran compiler does not accept free-format source code
configure: which means the compiler is either seriously broken, or
configure: is too old to build Sage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gfortran...
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG gfortran
```

Fixed by this ticket as seen here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/449550746?check_suite_focus=true
