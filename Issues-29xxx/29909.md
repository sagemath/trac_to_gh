Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron, linear transformation

In 9.2.beta5 applying linear transformations to a polyhedron containing a ray is broken:

```
sage: Polyhedron(rays=[(0,1)]).linear_transformation(identity_matrix(2))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ppl/generator.pyx in ppl.generator.Generator.ray()

ppl/generator.pyx in ppl.generator.Generator.ray()

ValueError: PPL::ray(e):
e == 0, but the origin cannot be a ray.
```

this used to work just fine in 9.2.beta4.

`git bisect` seems to blame the regression on #29843

I was thinking about that one. At first glance this might be a bit weird, because the matrix is supposed to act from the left. However it is shorter and easier to read I guess (and slightly faster I suppose).
