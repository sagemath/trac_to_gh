Several comments to start:
- `bitset_init` to a malloc, so it should be call only once. check file `src/sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi`.
- and before returning the result, you must do `bitset_free`
- to empty the bitset, use `bitset_zero` or `bitset_clear`
- all BFS call can be done inside the main loop. I don't see the need for starting computation before the loop.
- If needed, you can emulate a `do..while` loop using a `while True:` and a test at the end with a break or return statement.
- You don't need to maintain sets K and L. 
- It shall be more efficient to maintain the list of active vertices, i.e. for which the eccentricity is not proved yet.
- You could rename `min_L` and `min_K` as `LB` and `UB` to ease readability of the code ?

You are right. I dont know what was I thinking.

agreed

I guess, we wont need this too.

- In the tests, you have to be very careful with random graphs. May be it's not connected, or has a larger diameter, etc. I suggest to change the test as follows:
  - use a smaller value of n, like 20 or 30
  - use a smaller density like .3. .6 is for very dense graphs.
  - don't print the result. Instead, call another algorithm (the basic one) and check that the results are the same. This is much more robust.

- some simple improvements

```diff
-    if not n or n == 1:
+    if n <= 1:
```

```diff
-    memset(ecc_lower_bound,0,n * sizeof(uint32_t))
+    memset(ecc_lower_bound, 0, n * sizeof(uint32_t))
```

```diff
-        if(ecc[source] == ecc_lower_bound[source]):
+        if ecc[source] == ecc_lower_bound[source]:
```
- when adding a comment at the end of a line, ensure to let 2 spaces. I don't remember if it's pep8 or something else, but it's apparently better.

```diff
-    bitset_init(seen,n) # intializing bitset
+    bitset_init(seen,n)  # intializing bitset
```


Along the code, you should add comments like: 
- we take a vertex with minimum eccentricity lower bound and compute it's exact eccentricity
- if its eccentricity equals its lower bound, we found a vertex with minimum eccentricity, and so the radius
- otherwise, we take the vertex at largest distance from the current source, called the antipode, and use BFS distances from this antipode to improve eccentricity lower bounds.

And FYI, in this kind of algorithms, a vertex with small eccentricity helps reducing the upper bounds while a vertex with large eccentricity helps increasing lower bounds.  That's why we don't use more the BFS from source here. We care only about lower bound.

Q: have you tested the algorithm on rather large graphs ? Do you agree that it's way faster than other algorithms ?

The default of this test is that soon it will compare the new algorithm with itself ;)
Currently, when calling `G.radius()`, we take the minimum over all eccentricities, and for unweighted undirected graphs, eccentricities are computed using the algorithm by Takes and Kosters in `distances_all_pairs`.
So you could do for instance the following

```diff
-        sage: radius(G) == G.radius()
+        sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
+        sage: radius(G) == min(eccentricity(G, algorithm='bounds'))
```
In the future, we should rename `'bounds'` to something like `'TK'` to better distinguish between algorithms by Takes and Koster and algorithms by Dragan, Habib and Viennot.

I just realized that the key of the reference to the paper is Habib2018 while the first author is Dragan. Please correct that and put the reference at the right place.

I have added method for computing radius of weighted graph in boost_graph.pyx file.

TODO: 
- complete documentation
- add testcases

Major issue: 
- on running program alongwith radius, following error occurs. I tried solving it, with no luck. Can you look into it.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import radius
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: radius(G)

I suspect the issue is `cdef vector[double] ecc = {0 for i in range(n)}`. I tried using a for loop with `push_back` and got no issue.

You can:
- use type `bint` for `negative_weight`
- use type `v_index` for `source`, `next_source`, `antipode` and `v`
- use strict comparison for `if eccentricity <= result.distances[v]:`
- error message start with lower case letter, so This -> this

I have updated documentation. For testing correctness, I have checked this on unweighted graphs. For performance comparisons, I have compared it with `G.radius(algorithm='Dijkstra_Boost')` on unweighted graphs.
\\
Can you suggest me some weighted graph to test and compare it on.

```
This error occurs due to conversion of `G` from `unweighted` to `weighted` and this conversion occurs in `shortest_path_lengths` method in `generic_graph.py`

Ideas to solve this problem 
- Either we make sure that `radius` method in `boost_graph.pyx` is always called with non-none weight function, as done in `shortest_path_lengths` method in `generic_graph.py`. As we cannot define a function inside cpdef function.

- We make changes in `shortest_path_lengths` in `generic_graph.pyx` method and simultaneously update `shortest_paths` method in `boost_graph.pyx`. (This might have some other consequences.)

You raised an issue that must be fixed separately.

I pushed further improvements in a new branch and removed dependency on 29660.
The main change is to reduce the number of arrays used. Do not hesitate to make further tests.

This should fix the documentation.

Some issues remain with the usage of weights with boost. If the method is called without weight function and that `g.weigthed() == False`, then the weight of edges is set to 1. This is not documented in the boost method.
Also, we don't use the parameter `check_weight`.

Are you suggesting this?
\\\\

> Also, we don't use the parameter `check_weight`.

For this we can do the following:
- In `radius` method in `graph.py`

```diff
+    if by_weight and not weight_function:
+        def weight_function(e):
+            return e[2] if e[2] else 1
```

- In `radius_DHV` in `boost_graph.pyx`, introduce check_weight parameter

```diff
+    if check_weight and weight_function:
+         self._check_weight_function(weight_function)
```

What are your opinion on this. I will apply same changes in #29744

better to do `return 1 if e[2] is None else e[2]`. Somehow, we should raise an error if the label of an edge is a string or something else.

You can do it here and mention in diameter ticket that the issue is fixed here.

A possible fix is to change the test in method eccentricity to:

```
        if v is None or all(u in self for u in v):
```

and when calling method eccentricity to set `v=None` instead of `v=list(self)`.

One problem that we forget to address in #29734 was that :
- We didnt updated documentation of `shortest_paths` method in `boost_graph.pyx`, to this. 

```diff
+    - ``weight_function`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that
+      associates a weight to each edge. If ``None`` (default), the weights of
+      ``g`` are used, if ``g.weighted()==True``, otherwise all edges have weight 1
```

- To make weight_function use uniform, I think, we should make following changes in, `shortest_path`, `shortest_path_length`, `shortest_paths` , `shortest_path_lengths`,  `shortest_path_all_pairs`

```diff
+ if by_weight and weight_function is None:
+     def weight_function(e):
+         return 1 if e[2] is None else e[2] 
```
and this should be at the begining of each method, so that we wont have to worry about it anymore.

What are your opinion on this?

And your proposal is certainly good.
