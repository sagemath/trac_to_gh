Volume, f-vector and Ehrhart polynomial of polyhedra can be hard to compute, but take little memory when saving.

So we pickle those values, e.g.

```diff
+    @cached_method(do_pickle=True)
-    @cached_method
     def f_vector(self):
```

It looks good to me.
Is there a reason why you did not do the same for functions of CombinatorialPolyhedron?

Yes, `CombinatorialPolyhedron` doesn't exactly pickle. It just reduces, i.e. save enough data to initialize the object again. At some point one could think about a better way of pickling, of course.
