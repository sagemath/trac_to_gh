We implement a method on matrices that gives a new matrix with specified base ring
and entries 1 where and only where the initial matrix had zero entries, and 0 elsewhere.

Motivation: This method is useful to obtain the incidence matrix of a polyhedron from the slack matrix in #29837.

Along the way this ticket also fixes a bug:

```
M = Matrix(ZZ, [[0,1],[0,1]])
sage: M._mod_int(2).transpose()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1400             1

   1403         if self._nrows == 0 or self._ncols == 0:
   1404             return A

TypeError: Cannot convert sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense_float.Matrix_modn_dense_float to sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense
```

To optimize this method, a matrix class can use the optimized `get_is_zero_unsafe`.
In this ticket this is done for most matrix classes. We also use this new optimized zero check in places where it makes sense.

Keywords: incidence matrix, zero pattern

why can't you use `mod`?

```
sage: M = Matrix(ZZ, [[0,1],[0,1]])
sage: M.mod(2)
[0 1]
[0 1]
```

I really don't know why, but `change_ring` is really slow (e.g. for `ZZ` -> `GF(2)`). It should be improved, but maybe not in this ticket.

`_mod_two` uses the ring with two elements to obtain the parent. However, `get_matrix_class` gives you `modn` in this case. It gives you `mod2` if you pass the field with two elements.

When? As in `slack_matrix.apply_map`?

This is slow, whatever I do.

If `slack_matrix` is the `slack_matrix` of the `polytopes.associahedron(['A', 9])` obtained e.g. with

```
sage: def get_slack(P):
....:     self = P
....:     Vrep_matrix = matrix(self.base_ring(), self.Vrepresentation())
....:     Hrep_matrix = matrix(self.base_ring(), self.Hrepresentation())
....:     hom_helper = matrix(self.base_ring(), [1 if v.is_vertex() else 0 for v
....:  in self.Vrepresentation()])
....:     hom_Vrep = hom_helper.stack(Vrep_matrix.transpose())
....:     slack_matrix = (Hrep_matrix * hom_Vrep).transpose()
....:     return slack_matrix

sage: slack_matrix = get_slack(polytopes.associahedron(['A', 9])
```

than the solution of this ticket needs about 15 ms. In comparison to

```
sage: %time incidence_matrix = M.apply_map(lambda y: not y, R=M.base_ring())
CPU times: user 281 ms, sys: 15.8 ms, total: 296 ms
Wall time: 296 ms
```

(which is 100 ms slower than the trivial `lambda y: y`).

<a id='comment:17'></a>For the `x = 1 - x`, I was thinking the matrix was already a 01 matrix (and perhaps you were trying to do it in-place). This is also slower than simply doing this?

```python
        cdef Py_ssize_t i, j
        for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
            for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:

                    M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 1)
```
This is more generic, but perhaps it is slower for special cases (e.g., rationals) because it goes partially through Python.

I have some questions:

Should this be lifted up to a generic matrix method with a generic implementation of `get_is_zero_unsafe`?

Do you want to be an integer matrix or a mod2 matrix? The latter seems like it would be more memory efficient and possibly faster.

I am not sure it is safe to assume the initialized matrix is 0. Is this documented somewhere?

<a id='comment:18'></a>Good point. It is documented that the entries are not initialized.

So the following would be better:

```
cdef Matrix_integer_dense M = self._new(self._nrows, self._ncols)
cdef Py_ssize_t i, j
    for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
        for j from 0 <= j < self._ncols:
            if self.get_is_zero_unsafe(i, j):
                M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 1)
            else:
                M.set_unsafe_si(i, j, 0)
```

For integers the difference between `if not self.get_unsafe(i, j)` and `if get_is_zero_unsafe(i, j)` is a factor of three. For rationals the difference is a factor of about 20.

Do we want `get_is_zero_unsafe` to return a `bint` instead of an `int`? I don't hold a strong opinion, but I generally prefer the most restrictive/informative return type possible.

I don't find an example of a matrix with base ring not a ring. It is mentioned in the constructor that such things exists, but I can't find it. Can you help me out?

We could have another optional argument, where you specify what you want to fill the matrix with, if not ones.

<a id='comment:35'></a>Okay, this is an implementation for all of the specialized dense matrices I mentioned before.

I really don't like how in the gf2e it redirects through python for such a key feature with `get_unsafe`. This needs to be removed and is now #29853. Likely the way to do it will be based on what is done for gfpn.

Some additions of better `__bool__` methods:

```
sage: K.<z> = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: A = matrix(K, 4, 3, [0, -z, -2, -2*z + 2, 2*z, z, z, 1-z, 2+3*z, z, 1+z, 0])
sage: %timeit bool(A)
10000000 loops, best of 5: 86.2 ns per loop
sage: %timeit bool(Z)
10000000 loops, best of 5: 152 ns per loop
```
versus before:

```
sage: %timeit bool(A)
The slowest run took 70.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 5: 8.49 µs per loop
sage: Z = matrix(K, 4, 3, 0)
sage: %timeit bool(Z)
The slowest run took 7.43 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 50 µs per loop
```

I also made changes in other places where `get_is_unsafe_zero()` could be used. Like the above and in your use case, this likely has (potentially significantly) sped things up.
