This ticket collects some improvements for obtaining incidence matrices:

- The method `self._is_zero` is called many times and we can save plenty of time by obtaining it beforehand.
- We can obtain the slack matrix by multiplying the Vrepresentation matrix with the homogenous Vrepresentation. From this we can obtain the incidence matrix (strangely this last step takes up most of the time).

  Unfortunately, matrix multiplication for algebraic fields isn't very efficient. So we need to keep the old method in this case.

I don't think the change to `GF(2)` was needed to make things better. So I can rewrite some stuff and remove #29839, that would also do it, I think. `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense` is probably just as fast or faster than the other one.

I really only thought that this is the more natural thing for a 0/1 matrix. If the more natural thing is base ring integer or `GF(2)` really performs awful, I can just revert that decision.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I don't know how fast conversion back and forth works. It is true, that numpy is a bit faster, but that doesn't help me if I cannot convert things.

E.g.

```
sage: P = polytopes.associahedron(['A', 9])
sage: %time a = np.array(P.Vrepresentation())
CPU times: user 383 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 383 ms
Wall time: 382 ms
```

This is already longer than it takes to obtain the entire incidence matrix. Of course this is most likely not an ideal way to convert, but I don't know any better way at the moment.

And conversion back is also slow.
