```
In the `BIBD_constructions` dictionary, values are lists
of blocks except one which is a design object.

We fix this inconsistency as we plan for the function that
constructs BIBDs to be extended to lambda other than 1.

Could something like:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.bibd import balanced_incomplete_block_design
sage: balanced_incomplete_block_design(176, 50, 14)
True
```
be added as a doctest?

Set the ticket to `needs_review` when ready for review.

Use full name in "Authors" field rather than trac username.

At the moment the `balanced_incomplete_block_design` function only takes 2 parameters (`v` and `k`).
I was planning to make another ticket where that function gets expanded to allow arbitrary values for lambda. 
Do you think I should add everything here?

It's fine either way. Keep the doctest for the other ticket if you do two.
