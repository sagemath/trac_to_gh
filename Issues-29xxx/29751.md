The installation documentation mentions installing ccache from the system package, but the system package doesn't actually configure the system to use ccache instead of plain gcc/g++.

Once can also install `sage -i ccache` and that should just work, but it's just as convenient to use the system package.  It just needs recommendations for how to configure it.

Keywords: **Cygwin, sd109**
