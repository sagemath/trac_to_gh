We set up the cross polytope with precomputed double description, if the backend supports it. Otherwise, the vertices will be used as before (the shorter input is selected automatically by #28880).

Before this ticket:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.cross_polytope(8, backend='field')
CPU times: user 14.3 s, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 14.3 s
Wall time: 14.3 s
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.cross_polytope(13, backend='ppl')
1 loop, best of 5: 312 ms per loop
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: %time P = polytopes.hypercube(8, backend='field')
CPU times: user 29.8 ms, sys: 11.2 ms, total: 41 ms
Wall time: 40.3 ms
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.cross_polytope(13, backend='ppl')
1 loop, best of 5: 312 ms per loop

sage: %timeit P = polytopes.hypercube(13, backend='field')
10 loops, best of 5: 69.5 ms per loop
```

Note: This might slow down some backends (e.g. `ppl`) a bit, as the inequalities are precomputed and then discarded again. However, this seems to be only minor. The speed up for backend `field` is significant, as nothing is being computed anymore.
