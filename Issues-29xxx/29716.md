*Splitting algebras* have been considered by [Dan Laksov, Anders Thorup](http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/fulltext.php?artid=4791&year=2012&volume=61), [Torsten Ekedahl](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219498805001034) and others in order to study intersection theory of Grassmann and other flag schemes. Similarily as *splitting fields* they can be considered as extensions of rings containing all the roots of a given monic polynomial over that ring under the assumption that its Galois group is the symmetric group of order equal to the polynomial's degree.

Thus they can be used as a tool to express elements of a ring generated by `n` indeterminates in terms of symmetric functions in these indeterminates.

This ticket realizes splitting algebras by a recursive quotient ring construction splitting off some linear factor of the polynomial in each recursive step. Accordingly it will be inherited from class `PolynomialQuotientRing`.

I made it through the ticket, and mostly I changed some minor things. However, there is one more serious issue that I don't know how to fix:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.splitting_algebra import SplittingAlgebra
....: L.<u, v, w> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ); x = polygen(L)
....: S.<X, Y> = SplittingAlgebra(x^3 - u*x^2 + v*x - w)
....: (X, Y)
....: 
(Y, X)
```
The names of the generators do not match, but I don't know how much confusion this will cause to users or how much this even makes sense. Could you clarify about what you expect to happen here?

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A5):

Thanks for all these PEP8 corrections! I'm suprised that the two missing supression of the warning didn't cause a doctest failure.

I didn't realize the exchange of the indeterminates and this is definitely not intended. The reason for this is that I provided the `_first_ngens` by means of the recursive construction. But, since `X` is adjoined first and than `Y` this lead to the wrong order.

I dropped the method `gens_recursive` since it is needed nowhere else and replaced its invocation by the usage of the first `n` `splitting_roots` which are in the correct order.

I omit a separate test for this bug, since it is implicit in this change

```diff
-            (X + 1)*Y
+            X*Y + X
```
