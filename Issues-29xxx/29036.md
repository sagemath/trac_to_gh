The problem was reported on Debian, but I checked the source on git to see it was also there upstream.

The problem is that the sage_version function in src/bin/sage is using $SAGE_foo variables, but is called (by itself and through others, like usage and usage_advanced) by functions which are called before the environment has been set. Run where $0-version.sh isn't readily available, it even tries to source a file on a wrong path, which just gives an error.

Works for me, too:

```
% ls
% tar xf ../../tar-files/sage-9.1.rc2.tar.gz 
% cd sage-9.1.rc2 
% ./sage -v
SageMath version 9.1.rc2, Release Date: 2020-04-25
```
I suppose it could be a Debian problem, or more generally a problem for the distros. `@`Snark: Is there a reason to keep this open?
