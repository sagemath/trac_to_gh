In #21785 we changed the name of the file used to indicate that a folder shouldn't be doctested from `nodoctest.py` to `.nodoctest`. This stopped the python installation procedure from wanting to byte compile a file that is either empty or only text. Unfortunately, dot file are not included in the glob formula for installation. So, `.nodoctest` is not installed with the other files which is inconvenient for distribution and anyone who want to run doctest against the install rather than the sources.
