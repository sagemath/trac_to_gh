Why? What's wrong with this ticket?

Note that this ticket really has only one commit. If there is something wrong with #29903 or #29904 it should be fixed there. Not that I would know what the problem with those tickets would be.

One thing I could do is to use this ticket to improve the doctest for the hypercubes. Is that what you mean? Somethings as

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(intervals=random_intervals, backend='field')
sage: P._test_basic_properties()
```

If that is the problem, then this ticket here is still green and #29903 should be "needs work". To avoid confusion I can of course quickly push one commit to all three tickets.

So we don't put `set_random_seed` anymore because we will go through with #29935 soon?
