As reported in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50051/, 3d objects constructed by the method `plot3d()` of class `Graphics` do not display properly with `threejs`. A minimal example is

```
sage: g = plot(sin(x), (x, 0, 2*pi))
sage: g.plot3d()
/home/eric/sage/9.1.develop/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:592: 
RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: 
'Line' object has no attribute 'all'
  RichReprWarning,
```
Note that

```
sage: show(g.plot3d(), viewer='jmol')
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
works well.
Besides, if one change the value of the argument `z` from `0` (the default) to `2`:

```
sage: g.plot3d(z=2)
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
one does not get any error message but a wrong threejs display: the curve is located at z=-2 instead of z=2.

Depends on #29227
