Hi Frédéric, Travis!

Sorry, just starting to resurrect from ODK and heavy teaching last semester :-) I hope to finally come progressively back to real coding ...

Minimalism is a feature indeed, notably to not accidentally override generic methods of the categories in the tests.

At the same time, there is no additional code here, just some additional math information. Which illustrates that the user explicitly has to specify whether the set if finite or infinite if they care. The generic code can't deduce this automatically because of potential empty graded components.

So, altogether, given that the patch is written (thanks!), that it provides insight to the user, and that it does not clobber a functionality provided by the category, I lean toward merging it.

If at some point we come up with a more generic example of set with grading, then it will be time to move this example to SetsWithGrading().Infinite().example().

Cheers,
