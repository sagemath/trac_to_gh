Similar to #29411 + #29950, which made `sagelib` a pip-installable distribution (which is then installed by the sage-the-distribution script package `sagelib`), we change the build/installation scheme of the sage documentation.

We create pip-installable packages `sagemath-doc-html` and `sagemath-doc-pdf`. By providing wheels on pypi, users can get access to an offline copy of the documentation without having to build it themselves.

We create a package `sagemath-doc-inventory`, which is in charge of building and installing the inventory files.
It is a build dependency of `sagemath-doc-html` and `sagemath-doc-pdf`.

All of these packages depend on `sagemath-doc-src`. It has a build-system dependency on sagelib. An `sdist` of it consists of `SAGE_SRC/doc`. A `wheel` of `sagemath-doc-src` (and thus an installation) contains a copy of the sources (including the auto-generated rst files) in `share/doc/sage/src/` and the doctrees in `share/doc/sage/doctrees`.
The incremental build features of the docbuild will only be active when the package `sagemath-doc-src` is installed directly using `setup.py install`, `setup.py develop` or `pip install --editable`.  In these cases, the doctrees (including environment pickes) are kept in the source directory.
`pip wheel` will always make a from-scratch build of the documentation, eliminating incremental build errors.

The script `sage-grepdoc` will be provided by `sagemath-doc-html`.

Follow-up tickets:
- When installed using pip, the packages provide `nbextension`s that provide offline help in a Jupyter notebook. This is useful in particular with local notebooks connecting to remote sage kernels (see  #30306 (3)).
   - https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Distributing%20Jupyter%20Extensions%20as%20Python%20Packages.html
- Or alternatively as a JupyterLab extension
