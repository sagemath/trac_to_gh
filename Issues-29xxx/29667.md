# Issue 29667: Passing scale=semilogx or loglog to show() produces different results than plot()

Consider:

```
sage: f = 20*log(abs(4000000/(4000000 + 4000*x*i - x*x)), 10)
sage: g1 = plot(f, (x, 1, 1e6))
sage: g1.show(scale='semilogx')
sage: g2 = plot(f, (x, 1, 1e6), scale='semilogx')
sage: g2.show()
```

These should produce the same result.  However, after #29523 g1 will sample the points linearly, producing an inaccurate plot unless a very large number of points are used, but g2 will sample along the log-scale axis to produce an accurate plot.

The only way to correct this unexpected behavior would be to change plot so it either lazily evaluates the function when rendered or can recalculate the data points if it is called on a subplot with a different scale type than its own.

This would require implementing a new subclass of `sage.plot.GraphicPrimitive_xydata` that would hold all of the parameters passed to `_plot` for lazy evaluation.  Then one would need to modify `sage.plot.Graphics.matplotlib` to pass along the scale argument through `g.set_options` (after querying if it is supported by the primitive) prior to calling `g._render_on_subplot`.

After some discussion in #29523, we've decided that this approach would be likely to lead to bugs.  Therefore, once that ticket is merged I'll update the documentation to show the workaround (call one of the helper `plot_semilogx` or `plot_loglog` functions or pass `scale` in to `plot`) under this ticket.
