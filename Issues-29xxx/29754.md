Remove

- backports_abc
- backports_functools_lru_cache
- backports_shutil_get_terminal_size
- backports_ssl_match_hostname
- configparser
- enum34
- functools32
- future
- ipaddress
- pathlib2
- singledispatch
- subprocess32
- typing

Let's also remove `sagenb`, since it doesn't build with Python 3. That lets us remove

- flask
- flask_autoindex
- flask_babel
- flask_oldsessions
- flask_openid
- flask_silk
- sagenb
- twisted (it may be used by terminado when it is present, but terminado seems to function fine without it)
- werkzeug
