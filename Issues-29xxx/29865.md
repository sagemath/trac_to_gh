This ticket creates two experimental packages https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-objects/ and https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-categories/, outlined in Meta-ticket #29705, that consist of small subsets of the modules of sagelib, making Sage objects, the element/parent framework, categories, the coercion system and the related metaclasses available.

To build an sdist:

```
./sage -sh build/pkgs/sagemath_objects/spkg-src
./sage -sh build/pkgs/sagemath_categories/spkg-src
```
This creates a pip-installable source distribution `sagemath-objects-VERSION.tar.gz` (or `sagemath-categories-VERSION.tar.gz`) in `upstream/`.  

The distributions depend only on `Cython`, `pkgconfig`, `cysignals`, `gmpy2`. The latter, of course, requires various headers and libraries, so they are not quite "purely" pip-installable packages.

The goal is for all modules of **sagemath-objects** and **sagemath-categories** to be importable even when `sagelib` is not installed.  This can be tested (with tox) as follows:

```
./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagemath_objects/src && tox -v -v -e py39)'
./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagemath_categories/src && tox -v -v -e py39)'
```

**sagemath-categories** is intended to have **sagemath-objects** as a prerequisite. However, currently, **sagemath-categories** is an independent distribution that provides a superset of the modules of **sagemath-objects**.

Recombining it with the rest of sagelib via namespace package magic as outlined in #29705 is not implemented on this ticket. This will be done in follow-up tickets.

this is done (but I temporarily added modules to do doctesting)

This is probably best to do if we can include `Integer` as well, so that depends on #29911 (remove ntl dependency)

Okay.  I was going to say, it seems like sage-objects still depends too heavily on too much of `sage.categories`.  For my purposes I would want it to be as light-weight as possible.

I think it might also be worth it to further divide `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` into some `SageObjectBase`, `ParentBase`, and `ElementBase` that only provide the minimal C-level type structs necessary to bootstrap the rest of the hierarchy.

For `SageObject` this is trivial because its type struct is empty.  For `Parent` and `Element` the `Base` classes need to consist primarily of any cdef attributes which define the type struct.  Anything else is optional and can be bolted on in a subclass.
