The new package `sage-tdlib` represents the old `OptionalExtension` `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.tdlib` (building upon #29701, #28925). We use it as a second an example package for the modularization after `sage-meataxe` (#30151).

It does not use the incremental install mechanism of sagelib (`sage_setup.command.sage_install.sage_install_and_clean`). It uses a simple setuptools build system.
