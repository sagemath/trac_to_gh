In this example we compute `v`, the closest vector to the vector `u`
that lies in the integer lattice `L`. Problem: `v` is not in `L`.

```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
sage: M = matrix(ZZ, [[20957228, -4966110], [9411844, 19625639]])
sage: L = IntegerLattice(M)
sage: u = vector([-423434678248195, -18882583298608161305227077482])
sage: v = L.closest_vector(u)
sage: v in L
False
sage: MGAP = libgap(M)
sage: vGAP = libgap(v)
sage: libgap.SolutionIntMat(MGAP, vGAP)  # independent test that v is not in L
fail
```

This is a simplified version of
[Taylor Huang's example posted on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/CtPAbZPjoeU/m/qj2IH7LxBAAJ).

This used to work in Sage 8.4, and was broken in 8.5.beta3 by the
change from `round(x, 6)` to `x.n(digits=6)` in #26648.

The sage-devel thread also reports the membership test to be broken:

```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
coef = Matrix([-44429982080874270968379672793605458,
    98931650854481334735580708522902113])
bMat = Matrix([[20957228, -4966110], [9411844, 19625639]])
L = IntegerLattice(bMat)
coef*bMat in L  # should be true, but returns False
bMatGAP = libgap(bMat)
v = libgap(coef*bMat)[0]
sol = libgap.SolutionIntMat(bMatGAP, v); sol  # prints
# [ -423434671769860, -18882583298608161305225815339 ]
vector(sol.sage())*bMat == vector(coef*bMat)  # sanity check - prints True
```

but this is merely a type "error", in the sense that `coef` is not a vector,
but a 1x2 matrix (a different type, and automatic conversion does not happen here).
Not sure whether the latter warrants a fix.

<a id='comment:14'></a>The containment is "broken", as the 1x2 matrix `coef*bMat` fails to be coersed to a vector.
Namely, with the example in the 

```
sage: vector(coef)*bMat in L
True
sage: vector(coef*bMat) in L
True
sage: coef*bMat in L
False
sage: M=matrix([1,1])
sage: M*bMat in L
False
```

so this is not really a bug, it's just a conversion issue, absence of automatic conversion.

+In this example we compute `v`, the closest vector to the vector `u` that lies in the integer lattice `L`.
 
+These bugs are already in Sage 8.1 (i.e. still Python 2), as well as in the latest 9.2.beta1.
+
+However, closest_vector works in Sage 8.4, and is broken in 8.5 (membership test still broken, though).
+
+Problem: `v` is not in `L`.
+
+```
+sage: from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
+sage: M = matrix(ZZ, [[20957228, -4966110], [9411844, 19625639]])
+sage: L = IntegerLattice(M)
+sage: u = vector([-423434678248195, -18882583298608161305227077482])
+sage: v = L.closest_vector(u)
+sage: print(v in L)
+False
+sage: MGAP=libgap(M)
+sage: vGAP=libgap(v)
+sage: libgap.SolutionIntMat(MGAP,vGAP) # independent test that v is not in L
+fail
+```
+A simplified version of Taylor Huang's example posted on sage-devel (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/CtPAbZPjoeU/m/qj2IH7LxBAAJ)
+
+Membership test was reported broken, too (same thread)
+
+```
+from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
+coef = Matrix([-44429982080874270968379672793605458, 98931650854481334735580708522902113])
+bMat = Matrix([[20957228, -4966110],[ 9411844, 19625639]])
+L = IntegerLattice(bMat)
+coef*bMat in L # prints false
+bMatGAP=libgap(bMat)
+v=libgap(coef*bMat)[0]
+sol=libgap.SolutionIntMat(bMatGAP,v); sol # prints
+# [ -423434671769860, -18882583298608161305225815339 ]
+vector(sol.sage())*bMat==vector(coef*bMat) # sanity check - prints True
+```
+
+but this is merely a type "error", in the sense that `coef` is not a vector, but a 1x2 matrix (a different type, and automatic conversion does not happen here). Not sure whether the latter warrants a fix.

for IntegerLattice this looks irrelevant.

probably it was a dodgy old workaround, from pre-PPL days.

Even though we are working with an integer lattice, doesn't this
offer to find the closest lattice point to a non-integer vector?

the code we're changing only deals with the lattice, not with the vector we
are finding a closest lattice point for.
