In this example we compute `v`, the closest vector to the vector `u`
that lies in the integer lattice `L`. Problem: `v` is not in `L`.

```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
sage: M = matrix(ZZ, [[20957228, -4966110], [9411844, 19625639]])
sage: L = IntegerLattice(M)
sage: u = vector([-423434678248195, -18882583298608161305227077482])
sage: v = L.closest_vector(u)
sage: v in L
False
sage: MGAP = libgap(M)
sage: vGAP = libgap(v)
sage: libgap.SolutionIntMat(MGAP, vGAP)  # independent test that v is not in L
fail
```

This is a simplified version of
[Taylor Huang's example posted on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/CtPAbZPjoeU/m/qj2IH7LxBAAJ).

This used to work in Sage 8.4, and was broken in 8.5.beta3 by the
change from `round(x, 6)` to `x.n(digits=6)` in #26648.

The sage-devel thread also reports the membership test to be broken:

```
from sage.modules.free_module_integer import IntegerLattice
coef = Matrix([-44429982080874270968379672793605458,
    98931650854481334735580708522902113])
bMat = Matrix([[20957228, -4966110], [9411844, 19625639]])
L = IntegerLattice(bMat)
coef*bMat in L  # should be true, but returns False
bMatGAP = libgap(bMat)
v = libgap(coef*bMat)[0]
sol = libgap.SolutionIntMat(bMatGAP, v); sol  # prints
# [ -423434671769860, -18882583298608161305225815339 ]
vector(sol.sage())*bMat == vector(coef*bMat)  # sanity check - prints True
```

but this is merely a type "error", in the sense that `coef` is not a vector,
but a 1x2 matrix (a different type, and automatic conversion does not happen here).
Not sure whether the latter warrants a fix.

~~this is the same vector as computed by Sage code in the ticket description, oops. So the bug may be narrowed to fp(y)lll.~~

This vector is different from what Sage outputs, namely 

```
(-423434671769860, -18882583298608161305225815339)

and may be verified to be in L by calling libgap, say, or just
directly:

```

True
```

Note a comment on https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/124 which says that the basis should be LLL-reduced for this to work correctly.

<a id='comment:14'></a>The containment is "broken", as the 1x2 matrix `coef*bMat` fails to be coersed to a vector.
Namely, with the example in the 

```
sage: vector(coef)*bMat in L
True
sage: vector(coef*bMat) in L
True
sage: coef*bMat in L
False
sage: M=matrix([1,1])
sage: M*bMat in L
False
```

so this is not really a bug, it's just a conversion issue, absence of automatic conversion.
