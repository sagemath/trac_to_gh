Currently, installing Sage under WSL 2 (Ubuntu 18.04) produces 8 doctests failures in `sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions` for example:

```
File "src/sage/combinat/partitions.pyx", line 72, in sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions
Failed example:
    number_of_partitions( n - (n % 385) + 369) % 385 == 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
...
File "src/sage/combinat/partitions.pyx", line 95, in sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions
Failed example:
    len([n for n in [1..500] if number_of_partitions(n) != Partitions(n).cardinality(algorithm='pari')])
Expected:
    0
Got:
    21
```

The `./src/sage/combinat/partitions_c.cc` piece of `C` code was added into Sage in 2007. I guess it was invented because there was no fast enough existing wheel for that: the doctest of `number_of_partitions` function says it is `*very* fast`. Now, there is `flint`, which is still maintained and much faster:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_timeit import sage_timeit
sage: tf = lambda i : sage_timeit('_=number_of_partitions({})'.format(i), globals() , preparse=True, number=1, seconds=True)
sage: tb = lambda i : sage_timeit('_=number_of_partitions({}, algorithm="bober")'.format(i), globals() , preparse=True, number=1, seconds=True)
sage: [(i,tb(10^i)/tf(10^i)) for i in range(9)]
[(0, 1.076654167643153),
 (1, 51.60920756939386),
 (2, 51.13886939147276),
 (3, 122.66713137190546),
 (4, 471.61390056849905),
 (5, 2741.5143212699077),
 (6, 18715.222483310186),
 (7, 170662.0538251338),
 (8, 1930629.845842312)]
```

So, let me propose a backtrack version of Sage's motto: "To maintain the bike, forget your own old wheels, replace them with subsequently invented ones".

Why not just remove that piece of code ?

Note that arb and flint implementations are inspired by Bober Sage implementation, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5991

I propose removing the 'bober' implementation and supporting algorithm='pari' instead.

Pari's numbpart() was improved in the recent past and it's now twice as fast as Bober's code on my computer.

*Removing* sounds hard in my ears, as well. Wouldn't it be enough to print a warning on the first invocation of a functionality that uses `long double`? That could be done once per session which is running under WSL or some other platforms having similar problems.

Indeed, there are not many of them:

1. function `number_of_partitions` with option `algorithm='bober'`
2. method `BKZ` of dense integer matrices with option `fp='ld'`
3. method `LLL` of dense integer matrices with option `fp='ld'`

Such a warning should refer to the WSL issue 830 and make clear that wrong results are possible.

I don't see the point of maintaining obsolete code in Sage when there are multiple superior implementations in its standard libraries.

Don't get me wrong, this code was a terrific addition to Sage when Jon wrote it (lots of credit to him), but it has already more than served its purpose by inspiring even better implementations :-)

Of course, if Jon himself thinks the code should stay, I wouldn't argue with him.

I'm a bit late to this conversation.

In principle I agree that there is not much reason to leave this code in Sage given that it is so flaky and there is just about no good reason to use it.

On the other hand, if you actually want to trust WSL, it may still be worth trying to figure out what the actual problem is. The WSL ticket you point to seems to claim that floating point issues were fixed in WSL2, which is what you specifically mention as failing the tests. If they haven't been completely fixed then I would expect issues elsewhere.

If you get rid of the 4 lines starting at line 922, (long double ld_partial_sum = ...) and change level_two_precision to level_five_precision on line 873 (for (k = 1; current_precision > level_two_precision; k++)), I think you'll get a version that should work and doesn't use long doubles. (Maybe you get the same effect by setting level_two_precision = level_five_precision or long_double_precision = double_precision towards the top of the file, which is what appears to be done on some systems.)

I don't think I ever put in any of those ifdefs, and the ternary operator that checks if LDBL_MANT_DIG == 106 looks quite strange. (Also, the whole thing reads rather strangely if you don't know that once upon a time it used quad doubles and double doubles.)

I uploaded a branch that removes the code and redirects its uses to the faster `flint` implementation. To be complete, i am thinking of an additional refactor commit on top of that branch that merges the code of `sage.combinat.partition.Partition_n.cardinality` and `sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions` which are kind of duplicated (with some algorithms missing in the later), and adds some cross-algorithm testing (note that we have `flint`, `pari` and `gap` implementations).

Now, regarding whether we should merge that branch into Sage, i still do not understand how maintaining that code could benefit to the rest of Sage, even with respect to WSL2, and i do not understand how that piece of code could improve our trust of WSL2 with respect to the rest of Sage code. If the only point is to understand some floating-point subtleties of WSL2, then i am pretty sure that maintaining this code within Sage is not the right way (people who want to understand can think out of Sage source tree). If someone sees how this codes illustrates some WSL2 bug, it might be better to report upstream.

The ticket could be re-purposed to "Refactor the computation of the number of partitions".

Replying to [@sagetrac-tmonteil](#comment:22):
> I uploaded a branch that removes the code and redirects its uses to the faster `flint` implementation. 

Looks good to me.

> To be complete, i am thinking of an additional refactor commit on top of that branch that merges the code of `sage.combinat.partition.Partition_n.cardinality` and `sage.combinat.partition.number_of_partitions` which are kind of duplicated (with some algorithms missing in the later), and adds some cross-algorithm testing (note that we have `flint`, `pari` and `gap` implementations).

I would suggest to use a follow-up ticket for this.

I would think it's definitely out of the scope of the Sage project to investigate hypothetical errors of other upstream libraries on WSL2 because of ABI problems.
