Keywords: polytopes, precomputed data, permutahedron

We set up the permutahedron with both Vrepresenation and Hrepresentation, if the backend supports it.

If the backend supports precomputed data (currently `field`) this is much faster. Otherwise, this is a bit faster, as the Hrepresentation seems to be the better choice.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)  # using ppl
10 loops, best of 5: 56.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)  # using ppl
1 loop, best of 5: 1.57 s per loop
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)  # using ppl
10 loops, best of 5: 34.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)  # using ppl
1 loop, best of 5: 1.04 s per loop
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(8, backend='field')
CPU times: user 587 ms, sys: 20 ms, total: 607 ms
Wall time: 607 ms
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(9, backend='field')
CPU times: user 5.08 s, sys: 248 ms, total: 5.33 s
Wall time: 5.33 s
```

Note that `field` is much slower than `ppl` before this ticket and the timings are therefore omitted.

As the order of Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation changes, a lot of tests need to be fixed.

These timings are interesting. Perhaps it would be good to add them to the documentation of the function? Since the backend `field` performs well but isn't the default, it would be good to give this information in the documentation.

As for the bad exit it appears that memory consumption is highly unstable during doctesting.
I can make it pass with 2400 MB and default is 3300 MB, so I would expect this to work anywhere, but I guess this is not the case. (And 2400 MB is much over what causes a bad exit for Sébastien Labbé).

I guess I just mark it as not tested. The examples are more for documentation than for testing.
