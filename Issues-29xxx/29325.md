We set up the permutahedron with both Vrepresenation and Hrepresentation, if the backend supports it.

If the backend supports precomputed data (currently `field`) this is much faster. Otherwise, this is a bit faster, as the Hrepresentation seems to be the better choice.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)  # using ppl
10 loops, best of 5: 56.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)  # using ppl
1 loop, best of 5: 1.57 s per loop
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)  # using ppl
10 loops, best of 5: 34.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)  # using ppl
1 loop, best of 5: 1.04 s per loop
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(8, backend='field')
CPU times: user 587 ms, sys: 20 ms, total: 607 ms
Wall time: 607 ms
sage: %time P = polytopes.permutahedron(9, backend='field')
CPU times: user 5.08 s, sys: 248 ms, total: 5.33 s
Wall time: 5.33 s
```

Note that `field` is much slower than `ppl` before this ticket and the timings are therefore omitted.

As the order of Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation changes, a lot of tests need to be fixed.

I can make it pass with 2400 MB and default is 3300 MB, so I would expect this to work anywhere, but I guess this is not the case. (And 2400 MB is much over what causes a bad exit for Sébastien Labbé).

I guess I just mark it as not tested. The examples are more for documentation than for testing.
