The documentation strings for `sum`, `prod`, and `product` should
- link to each other
- mention the Python builtin `sum` vs Sage's `symbolic_sum`

A tutorial could describe sum and product functions
more in-depth, mentioning more recipes, subtleties,
variations, and related concepts:

- weighted sums, linear combinations
- the `mean` function
- sum and product with numpy arrays
- numpy's cumulative sum function
- the `product` function from `itertools`
- product, dot-product, cartesian product, tensor product

Make sure the alternative suggestion more transparently matches the original:

```diff
         Also, only a limited number of functions are recognized in symbolic products:: 

             sage: product(valuation(n, 2), n, 1, 5)
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             TypeError: unable to convert n to an integer
 
         Again, use ``prod()``::

-            sage: prod(valuation(n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
+            sage: prod(valuation(n+1, 2) for n in range(5))
             0  
```
Maybe even improve the example to one that returns a nonzero value:

```diff
         Also, only a limited number of functions are recognized in symbolic products:: 

-            sage: product(valuation(n, 2), n, 1, 5)
+            sage: product(valuation(2*n, 2), n, 1, 5)
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             TypeError: unable to convert n to an integer
 
         Again, use ``prod()``::

-            sage: prod(valuation(n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
-            0
+            sage: prod(valuation(2*n, 2) for n in range(1, 6))
+            6
```
Make sure to avoid trailing whitespace (the two spaces after `0`.)
