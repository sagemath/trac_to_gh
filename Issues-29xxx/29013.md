#27824 made `$SAGE_LOCAL` a venv if a suitable system python3 is found.

In this ticket, we add support for installing builds of Sage with several python versions, sharing the non-Python packages in `SAGE_LOCAL`:
- keeping install records for Python packages (recognized by having `install-requires.txt` or `requirements.txt`) in `$SAGE_VENV/var/lib/sage/{installed,scripts,wheels}`, separate from those of non-Python packages (`$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/{installed,scripts}`)
- likewise for `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build`
- here `$SAGE_VENV` defaults to `$SAGE_LOCAL`, but can be overridden to an arbitrary directory that will be used as the wheel-building venv, for example  `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv/$PYTHON_TAG`.

Configuration:
- This is activated by running, for example, 
`./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3.8 --with-sage-venv="$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv/python3.8"`.


As of this ticket, we are able to establish the venv in an arbitrary configured directory instead of `SAGE_LOCAL`. This is already useful for #31396 to create a wheel-building venv that will not be packaged as part of `SAGE_LOCAL`.

In follow-up tickets, we gain the full functionality that facilitates testing with several Python versions without having to rebuild the Sage distribution.  This depends on:

- #30534 Repackage `pynac` as a pip-installable package

Follow-ups:

- We also want to support `./configure --with-sage-venv=no` which would suppress making any venv (#30896)

- Support the tricky case: When system python3 is not in use and SAGE_VENV != SAGE_LOCAL, then both a real `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python3` needs to be built and a venv in SAGE_VENV created... or should python3 be installed in `$SAGE_VENV`?)

- Optional: A file `build/pkgs/SPKG/trees` could override the install tree determination - this would allow us to for example install a package such as `jupyter_core` both into something like `SAGE_NOTEBOOK_VENV` and `SAGE_VENV`...

1) "venv" has to be in the path to indicate that it's a venv in the technical sense and not a random place with invitation to install stuff in it.

2) Definitely no versioning.

3) I suppose I could drop the final "sage", making it `lib/sage/venv`

That's correct.
In a fresh install, the first one will be empty.

In an install upgraded from earlier versions, there will be packages in both.
When there's an update, the old version if removed from the first one and the new version is added to the second one.

There's no reason you can't--I've often install C libraries into a virtualenv by setting the path to it in `./configure --prefix`.

-To implement this, an SPKG needs an indication that it is a Python package.  Per #30719, we use existence of `install-requires.txt` or of `requirements.txt`. 
+(Optional: A file `build/pkgs/SPKG/trees` could override the install tree determination - this would allow us to for example install a package such as `jupyter_core` both into something like `SAGE_NOTEBOOK_VENV` and `SAGE_VENV`...)

-This is mainly for #29039; but also facilitates testing with several Python versions without having to rebuild the Sage distribution.

I guess the issue is that manifests are now written to two different places, depending on whether it's a Python package or not.
