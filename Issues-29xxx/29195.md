```
currently, with py3 sage, 

```
sage: notebook()
```
results in an import error.

This is because sagenb is still lazy-imported in 
`src/sage/all.py`. This lazy import should be made conditional on python version.

If I use `if six.PY2` without any import statement, I see this when starting Sage:

```
NameError: name 'six' is not defined
```
So then of course `del PY2` is there so that `PY2` is not defined when `all.py` is imported when Sage starts up.

`six.PY2`: ["A boolean indicating if the code is running on Python 2"](https://six.readthedocs.io/#six.PY2)

Everything in `all.py` is executed when Sage starts, so if I put `import six` there, then `six` is available from the command-line. The current state of affairs:

```
sage: six
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-cfa698ef8823> in <module>()
----> 1 six

NameError: name 'six' is not defined
```
With `import six` in `all.py`:

```
sage: six
<module 'six' from '/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.1.beta4/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/six.py'>
```
We should not add any extra imports without good reason.

In random files in the Sage library, not everything is imported, so you can do `import six` and `six.PY2` without running into these problems. `all.py` is special.

If there is a dependency/doctest on py3 that needs any of sagenb then it is a bug.

Any tickets on this?

what's "broken" if sagenb is not (lazy) imported is sage.interacts - but this is as expected, it appears nothing in sage.interacts works without sagenb, despite some vague comments about Jupyter.

I don't understand how the tests in `src/sage/interacts/library.py` work on py3, without a functioning sagenb (but with these lazy imports present).

I get errors there on this branch.

But `sage -notebook` will (eventually) launch Jupyter, correct?  We are just removing the possibility of launching a notebook from within a Sage session here - I guess it's not possible to do that with Jupyter, or so I recall.

This business of interact depending on sagenb is tricky.  Not having interactive stuff in Jupyter is a real regression; I constantly use Sage cell server instances (and sometimes still Sage notebook) with interacts, and of course CoCalc has them.
