CC:  @fchapoton @embray @mkoeppe

currently, with py3 sage, 

```
sage: notebook()
```
results in an import error.

This is because sagenb is still lazy-imported in 
`src/sage/all.py`. This lazy import should be made conditional on python version.

well, I trust you that `six.PY2` is exactly what's needed. What's that `del PY2` for?
Why not just `if six.PY2:`, without `import` and `del`?

If I use `if six.PY2` without any import statement, I see this when starting Sage:

```

So then of course `del PY2` is there so that `PY2` is not defined when `all.py` is imported when Sage starts up.

Everything in `all.py` is executed when Sage starts, so if I put `import six` there, then `six` is available from the command-line. The current state of affairs:

```
sage: six
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-cfa698ef8823> in <module>()
----> 1 six

NameError: name 'six' is not defined
```
With `import six` in `all.py`:

```
sage: six
<module 'six' from '/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.1.beta4/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/six.py'>
```
We should not add any extra imports without good reason.

In random files in the Sage library, not everything is imported, so you can do `import six` and `six.PY2` without running into these problems. `all.py` is special.

If there is a dependency/doctest on py3 that needs any of sagenb then it is a bug.

Any tickets on this?

But `sage -notebook` will (eventually) launch Jupyter, correct?  We are just removing the possibility of launching a notebook from within a Sage session here - I guess it's not possible to do that with Jupyter, or so I recall.

This business of interact depending on sagenb is tricky.  Not having interactive stuff in Jupyter is a real regression; I constantly use Sage cell server instances (and sometimes still Sage notebook) with interacts, and of course CoCalc has them.
