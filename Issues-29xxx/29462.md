The problem is that we use digraph6, a format which is not supported by nauty previous to 2.6 according to

I would say it is good to go. Does anyone think this needs testing?

I checked that indeed `converseg` doesn't show up in version 2.5b9 but it is there in version 2.6.

Ok. Works.

E.g. nauty is being rejected on ubuntu-xenial, so that the doctest passes. But it is accepted by ubuntu-bionic.
