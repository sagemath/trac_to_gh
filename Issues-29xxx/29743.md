Using version 9.1 of sage, is_unit() fails for the element O(t<sup>0</sup>) of a power-series ring. 

This induces failure on elements O(t<sup>n</sup>) (for any n) of Laurent-series rings, since checking those elements results in checking their unit-part (valuation_zero_part), which is the element O(t<sup>0</sup>) of the appropriate power-series.

The bug does not depend on the base of the power-series. It occurs since is_unit() attempts to access the 0'th coefficient of the series, which does not exist in the special case of O(t<sup>0</sup>), resulting in an Index Error. 

Example is attached.

There are 2 possible approaches to address the problem:

1. make is_unit() return False for O(t<sup>0</sup>). This maintains consistency with the fact that O(t<sup>0</sup>).is_zero() returns True, and this is the approach currently implemented on the ticket-branch.

2. Decide that is_unit() should fail on O(t<sup>0</sup>), because O(t<sup>0</sup>) is a family of elements, some of which are units and some are not. Under this approach, however, it should be taken into account that the failure is induced on other cases, such as checking invertibility of a matrix over a laurent-series ring with determinant O(t<sup>n</sup>). Therefore I propose to raise a more informative error-message, such as "precision not enough to determine", bearing in mind that the message would propagate onwards.

Maybe you should rather check that the **precision** is not zero.

And you need to add a doctest for the modified behaviour.

Thank you for the fix. This approach looks correct to me. Since O(t<sup>0</sup>) does not have a multiplicative inverse, `is_unit` should be `False`.

A similar fix should be applied to multivariate power series as well, so I am setting this back to *needs work*.
