Fix in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/351, https://github.com/mkoeppe/pynac/releases/tag/pynac-0.7.26.sage-2020-03-28

The "temporary upstream" tarball URL is in `checksums.ini`. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" pynac-clean pynac`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.

```
As you can see, the first test (`AM_PATH_PYTHON`) use `sage-python23` properly. But not the second that goes directly for `pythonX.Y`. Worse, that's by design of the macro.

```
	AC_PATH_PROG([PYTHON],[python[$PYTHON_VERSION]])
	if test -z "$PYTHON"; then
	   AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find python$PYTHON_VERSION in your system path])
	   PYTHON_VERSION=""
	fi
```
And for the cherry on the top of the cake, I believe `PYTHON_VERSION` is set by `AM_PATH_PYTHON`. Conclusion `AX_PYTHON_DEVEL` doesn't do exotic python name, and you better have a regular python executable in the PATH. Now, I'd like to know more about that setup that has `sage-python23` in the PATH but not the matching `pythonX.Y`. Did something happen while I wasn't looking?

It shows now because this is a test with system python3 (#27824) instead of building sage's own python3. On macOS, there is `/usr/bin/python3` (which is Python 3.7) but no `/usr/bin/python3.7`.

I apologize if this is noise (I may have messed up my installation somehow), but I thought I should report that I had trouble building pynac in 9.1rc0 on Mac OS 10.15.3, even with this ticket:

```
Attempting to download from https://github.com/mkoeppe/pynac/releases/download/pynac-0.7.26.sage-2020-04-03/pynac-0.7.26.sage-2020-04-03.tar.bz2

```
I merged #29408 and this ticket, and ran `make build`, then realized that the description of this ticket has a different make command, so I tried that, too. But pynac did not download. I am attaching the `pynac-0.7.26.sage-2020-04-03.log` log file from the more complicated build command, in case it is of use.

The build went smoothly after I manually downloaded pynac and put it in the upstream directory, so I want to say thanks for these patches! I never would have figured out how to fix the build errors on my own.

this might be due to (system) python, more precisely its urllib module, being unable to provide correct certs...

does installing python 3.7 from python.org and also making sure it installs certs (there is a 2nd step in installation, iirc) fixes this?

Yes, that solved the problem. After installing python and certifi, pynac downloaded from mkoeppe's directory (and the build succeeded) when I used `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" pynac-clean pynac`. Thanks!
