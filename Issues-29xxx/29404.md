The "temporary upstream" tarball URL is in `checksums.ini`. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" pynac-clean pynac`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.

Shouldn't happen. We pass `PYTHON=sage-python23` explicitly to configure. That's what should be tested.

My gut feeling is that something funny happened to that line during processing. But I need config.log to establish it.

As you can see, the first test (`AM_PATH_PYTHON`) use `sage-python23` properly. But not the second that goes directly for `pythonX.Y`. Worse, that's by design of the macro.

```
	AC_PATH_PROG([PYTHON],[python[$PYTHON_VERSION]])
	if test -z "$PYTHON"; then
	   AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find python$PYTHON_VERSION in your system path])
	   PYTHON_VERSION=""
	fi
```
And for the cherry on the top of the cake, I believe `PYTHON_VERSION` is set by `AM_PATH_PYTHON`. Conclusion `AX_PYTHON_DEVEL` doesn't do exotic python name, and you better have a regular python executable in the PATH. Now, I'd like to know more about that setup that has `sage-python23` in the PATH but not the matching `pythonX.Y`. Did something happen while I wasn't looking?

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A4):
> Yes for the split. I am surprised that problem shows now in pynac. I would have expected it to happen much earlier. The AX_PYTHON_DEVEL macro is 5 years old - which probably doesn't help.

It shows now because this is a test with system python3 (#27824) instead of building sage's own python3. On macOS, there is `/usr/bin/python3` (which is Python 3.7) but no `/usr/bin/python3.7`.

I merged #29408 and this ticket, and ran `make build`, then realized that the description of this ticket has a different make command, so I tried that, too. But pynac did not download.

The build went smoothly after I manually downloaded pynac and put it in the upstream directory, so I want to say thanks for these patches! I never would have figured out how to fix the build errors on my own.

this might be due to (system) python, more precisely its urllib module, being unable to provide correct certs...
