Right now we support `./configure --with-system-SPKG={no,yes,force}`, where `force` means: terminate with an error if no suitable system package exists.

We rename these option values to `{no,check,yes}`, which makes the value `force` available for a new behavior: experienced/daring users can force to use the system package even if our `spkg-configure` has a concern about the system package. See #29494 (Reject old system pari with bug in hyperellcharpoly).

As a time-saving mechanism, this doesn't really solve the problem, because it doesn't distinguish between important checks (API and dependent-package compatibility) in spkg-configure.m4 and the ones that I consider unimportant (bug checks to enforce bleeding-edge patched versions).

While I'm working on the sage build system every day, I know that the latest pari-2.11.2 in Gentoo is absolutely fine, but if I take a month off and try to pass `--with-system-pari=yeptrustme`, it could compile stuff for three hours before crashing because another package needs a symbol in libpari that wasn't there in 2.11.2. Then I've wasted not just the time needed to build pari, but everything before it.

(In an ideal world) When I install sage I want all doctests to pass by default. This would also be great for automated testing, because then we don't have to keep a huge lists of things that fail here and there.

In #29493 I suggested a similar flag that skips some tests, when we don't use the package installed by sage. Of course this shouldn't be serious errors, but maybe the representation slightly differs.

In the case of #29494 it would be nice if I am informed at configuration time that pari is rejected because of a bug in hyperelliptic curves. Then, if I decide I don't care about hyperelliptic curves, I can insist on using pari anyway.

Maybe we could have a flag as `# expected failure trac:12345`, such that at configuration time it detects that those doctests aren't expected to work.

This might be hard to maintain but I believe it gives great flexibility to installation (and at installation time you know pretty good which parts of sage you are breaking). And it only exposes information that we know by automated testing anyway.

I think `force` is a better name for the new `whatever` option. (When I do `rm -f file` it does not return an error if `file` does not exist, and that's the point, no?)

What is the difference between `yes` and the current `force`?
