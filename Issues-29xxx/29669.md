The ticket makes it an error (with a clear message) when `./configure --with-python=2` is invoked.

```
checking Python version to install... configure: error: the only allowed value for --with-python is 3.  Support for Python 2 has been removed in Sage 9.2.
```

The ticket keeps variables such as `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION` and `SAGE_PYTHON3` unchanged, for compatibility.

Also, to clarify in light of the discussion in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/fgsSsJmVVXo/ZIcJq9x3AAAJ, this ticket does not affect which versions of Python are sufficient as `sage-system-python` (this is still all versions listed in `build/tox.ini`, which includes various 2.x and 3.x).

Part of meta-ticket #29141.

This was never quite right,

```
case "$with_python" in
     3*) SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=3;;
```

because it accepts `--with-python=3.9` and ignores everything after the 3 (it should throw an error in my opinion). Not a big deal now since it will be deleted soon.

There's a lot of other python-2.x stuff to be removed in the build system, scripts, docs, and SPKGs, but I think you are aware of that and plan to deal with it later? If so this is fine as a first step.
