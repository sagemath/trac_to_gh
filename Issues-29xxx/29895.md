```
The "simple verbosity system" in `sage.misc.misc` has 2 global variables, `LEVEL` and `verbose_files`, which are meant to be internal.

- Access is through functions `verbose`, `set_verbose`, `set_verbose_files`, `get_verbose_files`, `unset_verbose_files`, `get_verbose`, all of which are imported by `sage.misc.all`.

- Only `verbose` and `get_verbose` are used in sagelib.

- Additionally, `set_verbose` is used in doctests of sagelib.

We move the functions to a new module `sage.misc.verbose`, with `lazy_import` and deprecation.  This is preparation for #21349, and is also helpful for #29865 (modularization).

We also add some documentation taken from #21349.

We also deprecate the import of `verbose` into `sage.misc.all` as proposed in #17815.
