This fails with giac 1.7:

```
File "/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py", line 247, in sage.symbolic.integration.external.giac_integrator
Failed example:
    giac_integrator(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x)
Expected:
    1/12*(2*sqrt(x)*(4*sqrt(x) + 1) - 3)*sqrt(x + sqrt(x))
    - 1/8*log(abs(2*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) - 2*sqrt(x) - 1))
Got:
    1/12*(2*sqrt(x)*(4*sqrt(x) + 1) - 3)*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) - 1/8*log(-2*sqrt(x + sqrt(x)) + 2*sqrt(x) + 1)
```
