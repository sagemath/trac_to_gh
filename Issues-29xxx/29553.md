As mentioned in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Z9YS7Hh146I) it is desirable to have a simple check to test whether a given polynomial is symmetric (with respect to a given permutation group).

This ticket aims to implement a generic `is_symmetric(self, group=None)` on multivariate polynomials (where the default group is the full symmetric group).

We also update the check of symmetry in `SymmetricFunctions` so that construction from polynomials get faster. The computation time for

```
sage: n = 10
sage: f = x / (1-exp(-x))
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', n)
sage: seq = prod(f.subs({f.default_variable(): var}) for var in P.gens())
sage: sage: inp = [(var, 0) for var in P.gens()]
sage: seq_taylor = seq.taylor(*inp, n // 2)
sage: Sym.e().from_polynomial(P(seq_taylor))
```
went down from a minute to half a second.

Do you think it would be more consistent to add a `PermutationGroupElement._act_on_etuple_on_position`, rather than `ETuple.permuted`?\n\nAlso, you will want to merge #29540.",

It might be good to convert the polynomial to a dictionary first in order to speed up the looking up of coefficients, e.g.:

```diff
-        for e in self.exponents():
-            coeff = self[e]
-            for g in gens:
-                if self[e.permuted(g)] != coeff:
-                    return False
-        return True
+        pd = self.dict()
+        return all(pd[e.permuted(g)] == c for e, c in pd.items() for g in gens)
```

For the example at hand, this is noticeably faster:

```
sage: sage: n = 12
....: sage: f = x / (1-exp(-x))
....: sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
....: sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', n)
....: sage: seq = prod(f.subs({f.default_variable(): var}) for var in P.gens())
....: sage: sage: inp = [(var, 0) for var in P.gens()]
....: sage: seq_taylor = seq.taylor(*inp, n // 2)
....: sage: g = (P(seq_taylor))
....: %time g.is_symmetric()
....:
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 5.07 ms, total: 2.48 s
Wall time: 2.49 s                                       # before
CPU times: user 121 ms, sys: 2.11 ms, total: 123 ms
Wall time: 123 ms                                       # after
True
```
and even for small polynomials this seems to be at least as fast:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
....: f = (1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2
....: %timeit f.is_symmetric()
....:
10000 loops, best of 5: 177 µs per loop    # before
10000 loops, best of 5: 64.3 µs per loop   # after
```

Secondly, in `permgroup_element.pyx`, there are methods `_act_on_list_on_position` and `_act_on_array_on_position`. Do you think it would be more consistent to add a `PermutationGroupElement._act_on_etuple_on_position`, rather than `ETuple.permuted`?

Also, you will want to merge #29540.

It is sad this is the case. The polynomial datastructure is supposed to be fast in accessing coefficients... I believe it strongly depends on the base ring. But given the time difference I agree that it makes sense.

The `MPolynomial_libsignular.__getitem__` code looks like this:

```python
        m = p_ISet(1,r)
        i = 1
        for e in x:
            overflow_check(e, r)
            p_SetExp(m, i, int(e), r)
            i += 1
        p_Setm(m, r)

        while(p):
            if p_ExpVectorEqual(p, m, r) == 1:
                p_Delete(&m,r)
                return si2sa(p_GetCoeff(p, r), r, self._parent._base)
            p = pNext(p)
```
So it looks more like it is going through a list rather than a dict. I don't know how singular does this, but it looks like a very different data structure than the naïve implementation. IIRC, their data structure is solely to be efficient at computing Gröbner bases.

TL;DR Converting to a dict is definitely the best option with the current implementation.

As a more broader question, it might be worthwhile to consider reimplementing generic multivariate polynomials in Cython and only convert to (lib)singular when wanting a Gröbner basis.

Why would there be a `sig_free()`? `result` is the return value of the function, and it would be the job of the `ETuple` to handle freeing that in its deallocation I believe.

I also have a few comments:

```diff
-        - ``group`` (optional) - if set, test whether the polynomial is
-          symmetric with respect to the given permutation group.
+        - ``group`` (default: symmetric group) -- if set, test whether the
+          polynomial is invariant with respect to the given permutation group
```

This error message doesn't make sense to me `raise ValueError("wrong argument 'group'")`.

```diff
-        for e, coeff in coeffs.items():
-            for g in gens:
-                if coeffs.get(g._act_on_etuple_on_position(e, True), zero) != coeff:
-                    return False
-        return True
+        return all(coeffs.get(g._act_on_etuple_on_position(e, True), zero) == coeff
+                   for e, coeff in coeffs.items() for g in gens)
```

In `monomial.py`:

```diff
-from sage.combinat.partition import Partition
+from sage.combinat.partition import Partition, _Partitions
```

```diff
-        out = self.sum_of_terms((Partition(e), c)
-                                for (e,c) in f.dict().items()
-                                if all(e[i+1] <= e[i] for i in range(len(e) - 1)))
+        R = self.base_ring()
+        out = self._from_dict({_Partitions(e): R(c)
+                                for (e,c) in f.dict().items()
+                                if all(e[i+1] <= e[i] for i in range(len(e)-1))})
```

In `ETuple`:

```python

        if self._data != <int*>0:
            sig_free(self._data)
```
So whenever `result` (which is an `ETuple`) is destroyed, then that memory is freed.

To me the naming "on position" suggests a certain way a permutation acts on lists, independently from the notion of left and right (although this action does satisfy the properties of a left action). So I think either the `_on_position` or the `self_on_left` should be removed, as these terms are at odds with each other.

I would probably drop the `self_on_left` as it is simple enough to call the method on the inverse permutation instead when necessary, but your current implementation does the opposite of what `_act_on_list_on_position` does. I had not considered this before - sorry. Since you mentioned the action on polynomials, I can see why the current implementation might be preferable. In that case, you could just rename the method to `_act_on_etuple`.

In any case, left and right seem to be mixed up currently:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: p, q = S('(1,2,3,4,5,6)'), S('(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)')
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict import ETuple
sage: e = ETuple([10..15])
sage: right = lambda x, p: p._act_on_etuple_on_position(x, self_on_left=False)

You can construct a polynomial ring via `PolynomialRing(..., implementation='generic')` to use it, and when you want a Gröbner basis, only then it will convert to Singular (the conversion to libsingular does not seem to be supported).

The action of permutations on matrices implemented in `_act_on_` also has it the other way around, but for polynomials it works as expected:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: p, q = S('(1,2,3,4,5,6)'), S('(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)')
sage: M = matrix.diagonal([1..6])
sage: (M * p) * q == M * (p * q)
False
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 6)
sage: (R.0 * p) * q == R.0 * (p * q)
True
```
Am I misunderstanding something about left and right actions in Sage?

Here is where it comes from I think:

```
sage: (M * p.matrix()) * q.matrix() == M * (p.matrix() * q.matrix())
True
sage: (M * p.matrix()) * q.matrix() == M * (p*q).matrix()
True
sage: p.matrix() * q.matrix() == (p*q).matrix()
True
sage: p.matrix() * M == M * p
True
```
(An oddity that needs fixing: `p.matrix()` works but `p.to_matrix()` is a `NotImplemented`.)
Also Sage only knows it has a right action:

```
sage: (q * p) * M == q * (p * M)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Symmetric group of order 6! as a permutation group' and 'Full MatrixSpace of 6 by 6 sparse matrices over Integer Ring'
```
So I think the thing that needs to change in the perm group element `_act_on_` is

```diff
             elif is_Matrix(left):
+               return left.with_permuted_columns(~self)
+        else:
+            if is_Matrix(left):
                return left.with_permuted_rows(self)
```
Addendum: Because of this:

```
sage: M * p.matrix()
[0 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 2 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 3 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 4 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 5]
[6 0 0 0 0 0]
sage: M.with_permuted_columns(~p)
[0 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 2 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 3 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 4 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 5]
[6 0 0 0 0 0]
```

That would indeed be nice to have, as it is such a common operation. I did not know the `__iter__` method was implemented for polynomials and have always been zipping coefficients and monomials (or exponents), but it always felt odd to me, especially since this pattern fails for `CombinatorialFreeModule` elements if one does not pay attention to the sorting.


Regarding the action on matrices, we could handle that on a new ticket, as it alters existing behavior and is not really related to the aim of this ticket.

I am happy with this ticket as it is now. Except maybe there is one little detail from Travis' suggestion:

```
        out = self._from_dict({_Partitions.element_class(_Partitions, list(e)): R(c)
                               for (e,c) in f.dict().items()
```

The conversion `R(c)` should not be necessary here, as the coefficients should already be elements of the base ring.

Yes, although I am not sure if this will be a good option. However, IIRC things like multiplying polynomials is really slow and could use another library to speed that up.

This is now #29595.

I agree that it should be a separate ticket.

If we add that conversion, then we can remove the

```
assert self.base_ring() == f.base_ring()
```
which I think is not a good thing to enforce.

It comes from the finite Complex reflection group category. This can be easily fixed with an alias in the (finite) Coxeter group category (using the method `canonical_matrix`) and/or for the specific implementation of permutation groups.

Indeed, I found this line a bit weird. Though I did not touch since it was beyond the scope of the ticket.
