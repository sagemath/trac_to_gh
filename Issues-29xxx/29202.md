This ticket rewrites some constructions of ASCII and unicode art to avoid repeatedly adding character art elements, but to concatenate multiple character art elements in one go instead which is more efficient.

In `tensor_algebra.py` and `free_module.py`, this also removes some breakpoints that seemed to be unintended. This might stem from misunderstanding that adding two character art elements always creates a breakpoint in between. (Arguably, this is a bad default.)

```
sage: R = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ).R()
sage: Partitions.options(diagram_str="#", convention="french")
sage: a = ascii_art(tensor((R[1,2], R[3,1,2]))); a
R   # R
 #     ###
 ##      #
         ##
sage: a._breakpoints
[0, 3, 6]       # before (in particular the 0 is undesirable, the 3 unnecessary)
[6]             # after
```

Moreover, this ticket fixes the default implementation of `_unicode_art_` in `SageObject` (which is based on `_ascii_art_`) to preserve the ascii art element's breakpoints and baseline.
