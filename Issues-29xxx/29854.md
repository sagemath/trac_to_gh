```
So far this is just an illustration of what can be done with flit (#29846) and what cannot:

- Both non-src and src layouts are supported (for the latter, see https://github.com/takluyver/flit/pull/260).
- Symlinks of directories or files to somewhere outside of the root are not supported.

Not intended for merging at this point.

<a id='comment:12'></a>This fixes the sdist.

Same change on top of 27cf73b creates a tar file with a packaged symlink:

```
 lrwxr-xr-x       0/0             0 sage_conf-9.2b0/src --> ../../../../src
```
and gives an error afterwards:

```
