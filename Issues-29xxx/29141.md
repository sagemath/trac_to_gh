From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/vYlbnAwKATM "drop python2 compatibility in 9.1" (thread Jan 5-22, 2020).

Removal of Python 2 support in Sage 9.2 has been announced at https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch and https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.1

Removal tickets:

- #28000 For Sage 9.2: Remove python 2 support from sagelib
- #29669 For Sage 9.2: Remove Python 2 support from the build system and CI scripts
- #27826 - remove `long` hack for Python 3 in `doctest/forker.py`, remove all calls to `long()`
- #29754 - remove Python 2 package and packages which backports various parts of Python

Upgrade tickets:

**Please check that upgraded packages are compatible with Python >= 3.6** (and note this on the upgrade ticket) because we may wish to support Python 3.6 venv (#29033).

- #28197 - upgrade to ipython 7 / prompt-toolkit 2. See also #29042
- #27754 - Upgrade: Python 3.8.x (see [#27754 comment:55](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27754#comment:55) in particular)
- numpy >= 1.17 - #29425 Upgrade Cython to 0.29.16, NumPy to 1.18.2 to fix numpy build error on local-conda-forge-macos-standard
- #29730 Update sympy to 1.6
- matplotlib-3: #29547. Related: #28449 and [#27866 comment:25](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27866#comment:25)
- sphinx-2: #28856, #29095
- scipy-1.3+: #29115
- rpy2 3.x: #28988, #29441 
- networkx 2.4: #28450
- #29803 - Upgrade setuptools, setuptools_scm, pip

Other:

- compatibility with python 3.8... needs details
  * "at this point the major issues are python 3.8 and ipython 7, and I don't see how one could support several versions of them without forking hundreds of doctests. Both updates require multi-thousand-lines patches, due to changes in dict sorting and hashes."
- remove `src/sage/cpython/_py2_random.py`
  * This was added in #24508 and is only used during doctesting in order to ensure consistent random results between Python 2 and 3.
 
Reference: Tickets that kept Python 2 compatibility but introduced a performance penalty for Python 2:

- #29103 (get rid of part of itervalues)

python 3.8 update is tracked in #27754, there is a list of issues that need fixing. rpy3 support is merged already in 9.1.beta2 (#28988), as well as networkx 2.4, which is also py3-only (#28450). IMO #28190 is no longer worth the effort at this point, provided that python2 support is to be dropped at 9.2 in the worst case.

Consider keeping support Python 3.6, whose official support is till 2021-12-23. See #29033.

Python 3.5 support ends in 2020-09, so fine to drop it. See life cycle of Python versions:

- currently or recently supported versions: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- older versions: https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches
