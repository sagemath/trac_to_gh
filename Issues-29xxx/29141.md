From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/vYlbnAwKATM "drop python2 compatibility in 9.1" (thread Jan 5-22, 2020).

Removal of Python 2 support in Sage 9.2 has been announced at https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch and https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.1

Removal tickets:

- #28000 For Sage 9.2: Remove python 2 support from sagelib
- #29669 For Sage 9.2: Remove Python 2 support from the build system and CI scripts
- #27826 - remove `long` hack for Python 3 in `doctest/forker.py`, remove all calls to `long()`
- #29754 - remove Python 2 package and packages which backports various parts of Python

Upgrade tickets:

**Please check that upgraded packages are compatible with Python >= 3.6** (and note this on the upgrade ticket) because we may wish to support Python 3.6 venv (#29033).

- #28197 - upgrade to ipython 7 / prompt-toolkit 2. See also #29042
- #27754 - Upgrade: Python 3.8.x (see #27754#comment:55 in particular)
- numpy >= 1.17 - #29425 Upgrade Cython to 0.29.16, NumPy to 1.18.2 to fix numpy build error on local-conda-forge-macos-standard
- #29730 Update sympy to 1.6
- matplotlib-3: #29547. Related: #28449 and #27866#comment:25
- sphinx-2: #28856, #29095
- scipy-1.3+: #29115
- rpy2 3.x: #28988, #29441 
- networkx 2.4: #28450
- #29803 - Upgrade setuptools, setuptools_scm, pip

Other:

- compatibility with python 3.8... needs details
  * "at this point the major issues are python 3.8 and ipython 7, and I don't see how one could support several versions of them without forking hundreds of doctests. Both updates require multi-thousand-lines patches, due to changes in dict sorting and hashes."
- remove `src/sage/cpython/_py2_random.py`
  * This was added in #24508 and is only used during doctesting in order to ensure consistent random results between Python 2 and 3.
 
Reference: Tickets that kept Python 2 compatibility but introduced a performance penalty for Python 2:

- #29103 (get rid of part of itervalues)

Consider keeping support Python 3.6, whose official support is till 2021-12-23. See #29033.

Python 3.5 support ends in 2020-09, so fine to drop it. See life cycle of Python versions:

- currently or recently supported versions: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- older versions: https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches
