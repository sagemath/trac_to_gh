/home/dimpase/sage-src/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/misc/log.py in __init__(self, dir, debug, viewer)

```
Unsurpisingly, there are no doctests for it.

The problem is that the internal implementation of history in ipython has changed.


Similarly, no other `log_*()` work in that file. Should they be removed? There is nowadays `%history` magic in ipython, which allows one to do at least what `log_text()` was meant to do.
