it is broken

```
sage: from sage.misc.log import log_html

/home/dimpase/sage-src/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/misc/log.py in __init__(self, dir, debug, viewer)
     97         self._dir = dir

    100         self._input  = __IPYTHON__.input_hist_raw
    101         self._text = ''

AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'output_hist'
sage: __IPYTHON__
True
```
Unsurpisingly, there are no doctests for it.

The problem is that the internal implementation of history in ipython has changed.


Similarly, no other `log_*()` work in that file. Should they be removed? There is nowadays `%history` magic in ipython, which allows one to do at least what `log_text()` was meant to do.
