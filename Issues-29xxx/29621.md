Unsurpisingly, there are no doctests for it.

The problem is that the internal implementation of history in ipython has changed.


Similarly, no other `log_*()` work in that file. Should they be removed? There is nowadays `%history` magic in ipython, which allows one to do at least what `log_text()` was meant to do.
