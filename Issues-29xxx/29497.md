```
Symengine is a C++ symbolic engine
- that can be used as a backend in sympy (and makes it much faster)
- that implements "fast callable" for floats, GMP types, flint types, arb types, ... and accepts numpy arrays as arguments (the function is applied entrywise)

It is very strong candidate for replacing some of the symbolic we have in Sage, in particular all the fast callable.

The docker-based tests didn't go through because they are broken in 9.2.beta3 (#30064 has the fix).

But the `cygwin-standard` build (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/838016220) reveals a build problem:
