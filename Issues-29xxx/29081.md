our current (a very convoluted) test for system's gf2x version 1.2 stumbles on newer gf2x (due to a change in certain function signature). E.g. Arch already has 1.3, so this needs a fix.

An easy fix is to use pkg-config to test for the version, as now gf2x comes with gf2x.pc (I've done a patch for gf2x at some point to fix this :-)).

Forgot to mention: even though sage itself works fine, ntl<11.4.2 will fail to build. So using gf2x>=1.3 requires using ntl>=11.4.2 or applying this patch:

with #29109 done, gf2x 1.3.0 may be used without a problem. I've added #29109 as dependency here. So this can go forward too.
