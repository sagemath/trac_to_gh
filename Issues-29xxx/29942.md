Generalizing exercise 3, explain how to compute the rank of\n>    *a*<sub>1</sub>\u2026*a*<sub>*n*</sub>\n>    with respect to Algorithm L [lexicographic permutation generation]\n>    when {*a*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *a*<sub>*n*</sub>} is the multiset {*n*<sub>1</sub>\u00b7*x*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>\u00b7*x*<sub>*t*</sub>};\n>    here *n*<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + *n*<sub>*t*</sub> = *n* and\n>    *x*<sub>1</sub> < \u2026 < *x*<sub>*t*</sub>. (The total number of permutations is, of course, the multinomial coefficient\n>        multinomial(*n*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>) = *n*! / (*n*<sub>1</sub>! \u2026 *n*<sub>*t*</sub>!);\n>    see Eq. 5.1.2\u2013(3).) What is the rank of 314159265?\n\n> A. Use the recurrence rank(*a*<sub>1</sub> \u2026 *a*<sub>*n*</sub>) =\n>    1/*n* \u03a3<sub>j=1\u2026*t*</sub> *n*<sub>*j*</sub> [*x*<sub>*j*</sub> < *a*<sub>1</sub>] multinomial(*n*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>) + rank(*a*<sub>2</sub> \u2026 *a*<sub>*n*</sub>).\n>    For example, rank(314159265) is\n>        3/9 multinomial(2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)\n>        + 0\n>        + 2/7

algorithm is also based on this recurrence;\nhowever the application is not so straightforward.\nI did not find an explicit statement of an unranking algorithm elsewhere,\nand the algorithm I came up with isn't particularly elegant.\nI'd appreciate having another opinion on it or a pointer to some other reference.\nThe main idea is that given a rank *r* and a multiset\n*m* = {*n*<sub>1</sub>\u00b7*x*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>\u00b7*x*<sub>*t*</sub>},\nwe know that\n*r* = *c*/*n* multinomial(*n*<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>) + rank(*m*\\*c*),\nwhere *c* is the number of elements in *m* that are strictly less than\nthe first element of the output sequence, and *m*\\*c* stands for\n*m* with one instance of the *c*th smallest element removed.\n\n\n## Notes/caveats\n\nThe `rank` method is actually independent of the `Permutations_mset` object\nit is attached to.\nOther than the `self(p).check()` line,\nit never refers to `self`.\nIt could be defined in terms of a standalone function,\nas [StandardPermutations_n.unrank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/permutation.html#sage.combinat.permutation.StandardPermutations_n.unrank)\nis defined in terms of [from_rank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/permutation.html#sage.combinat.permutation.from_rank).\n\nI am aware of two ways in which this branch differs in behavior from what is there now.\nThey both seem to me to be because of bugs in the `EnumeratedSets` fallback implementations,\nbut I'll document them here in case complete compatibility is needed.\n\nThe first is that the existing\n[rank](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py?h=9.1#n668)\nmethod returns `None` when passed a list or a tuple,\nbecause it uses `==` comparison with an `element_class` type\n(I'm not sure how that works exactly, but at any rate it doesn't compare equal.)\nTo get `rank` to return something other than `None`, you have to pass in\na permutation produced by the `Permutations_mset` object itself.\n\n```\nsage: mset = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]\nsage: p = Permutations(mset)\nsage: p.rank(mset)\nsage: p.rank([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9])\nsage: p.unrank(3)\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 5]\nsage: type(p.unrank(3))\n<class 'sage.combinat.permutation.Permutations_mset_with_category.element_class'>\nsage: p.rank(p.unrank(3))\n3\n```\n\nIn this branch, the value passed to `rank` doesn't have to be an `element_class`.\n\n```\nsage: mset = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]\nsage: p = Permutations(mset)\nsage: p.rank(mset)\n0\nsage: p.rank([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9])\n0\nsage: p.unrank(3)\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 5]\nsage: type(p.unrank(3))\n<class 'list'>\nsage: p.rank(p.unrank(3))\n3\n```\n\nThe other way in which this branch changes behavior\nis that the current code does not canonicalize the multiset\nused to create the `Permutations_mset` object.\n`Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4])` and `Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1])`\nvisit the same permutations but in a different order;\nthe latter acts like an already partially enumerated version of the former:\n\n```\nsage: Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]).unrank(0)\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nsage: Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1]).unrank(0)\n[3, 2, 1, 1, 4]\n```\n\nIn this branch, the order of the input multiset does not make a difference:\n\n```\nsage: Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]).unrank(0)\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nsage: Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1]).unrank(0)\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nIt would be possible to work around this canonicalization, if necessary,\nby computing the rank of the input multiset on creation,\nand using it as an offset for future calls to `unrank`.\n\nI was working on a project that needed fast unranking of a multiset,\nwhen I found that Sage could not handle a multiset of the size I needed.\nI came up with [an algorithm](https://www.bamsoftware.com/comicrando/seed.html#algorithm)\nthat worked well enough for my purposes, however its ranking order is not lexicographic.\nThe algorithms in this branch are the result of a little more research\nto find a lexicographic algorithm.\n\n\nDepends on

```
The [Permutations_mset](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/permutation.html#sage.combinat.permutation.Permutations_mset)
`rank` and `unrank` methods inherit a generic implementation from `EnumeratedSets`
[rank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.html#sage.categories.enumerated_sets.EnumeratedSets.ParentMethods.rank) and
[unrank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.html#sage.categories.enumerated_sets.EnumeratedSets.ParentMethods.unrank),
which have running time proportional to the rank:

```
sage: mset = list(range(10)) * 3
sage: p = Permutations(mset)
sage: for e in range(8): timeit('p.unrank({})'.format(10^e), number=1, repeat=5)
1 loop, best of 5: 24.2 μs per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 39.1 μs per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 191 μs per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.28 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 12.7 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 126 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.27 s per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 13 s per loop
sage: p.rank(list(reversed(sorted(mset))))
... never finishes ...
```

This branch makes the running time roughly proportional to the size of the multiset:

```
sage: mset = list(range(10)) * 3
sage: p = Permutations(mset)
sage: for e in range(8): timeit('p.unrank({})'.format(10^e), number=1, repeat=5)
1 loop, best of 5: 1.35 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.43 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.37 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.37 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 2.23 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 2.12 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.46 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 5: 1.44 ms per loop
sage: timeit('p.rank(list(reversed(sorted(mset))))', number=1, repeat=5)
1 loop, best of 5: 1.51 ms per loop
```


## Algorithm

The `rank` algorithm is a straightforward application of the solution to exercise 7.2.1.2–4 in
*The Art of Computer Programming*, Volume 4A.
I will quote the exercise:

> Q. Generalizing exercise 3, explain how to compute the rank of
>    *a*<sub>1</sub>…*a*<sub>*n*</sub>
>    with respect to Algorithm L [lexicographic permutation generation]
>    when {*a*<sub>1</sub>, …, *a*<sub>*n*</sub>} is the multiset {*n*<sub>1</sub>·*x*<sub>1</sub>, …, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>·*x*<sub>*t*</sub>};
>    here *n*<sub>1</sub> + … + *n*<sub>*t*</sub> = *n* and
>    *x*<sub>1</sub> < … < *x*<sub>*t*</sub>. (The total number of permutations is, of course, the multinomial coefficient
>        multinomial(*n*<sub>1</sub>, …, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>) = *n*! / (*n*<sub>1</sub>! … *n*<sub>*t*</sub>!);
>    see Eq. 5.1.2–(3).) What is the rank of 314159265?

>    For example, rank(314159265) is
>        3/9 multinomial(2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
>        + 0
>        + 2/7 multinomial(1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1)
>        + 0
>        + 1/5 multinomial(1, 2, 1, 1)
>        + 3/4 multinomial(1, 1, 1, 1)
>        + 0
>        + 1/2 multinomial(1, 1) = 30991.

The `unrank` algorithm is also based on this recurrence;
however the application is not so straightforward.
I did not find an explicit statement of an unranking algorithm elsewhere,
and the algorithm I came up with isn't particularly elegant.
I'd appreciate having another opinion on it or a pointer to some other reference.
The main idea is that given a rank *r* and a multiset
*m* = {*n*<sub>1</sub>·*x*<sub>1</sub>, …, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>·*x*<sub>*t*</sub>},
we know that
*r* = *c*/*n* multinomial(*n*<sub>1</sub>, …, *n*<sub>*t*</sub>) + rank(*m*\*c*),
where *c* is the number of elements in *m* that are strictly less than
the first element of the output sequence, and *m*\*c* stands for
*m* with one instance of the *c*th smallest element removed.


## Notes/caveats

The `rank` method is actually independent of the `Permutations_mset` object
it is attached to.
Other than the `self(p).check()` line,
it never refers to `self`.
It could be defined in terms of a standalone function,
as [StandardPermutations_n.unrank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/permutation.html#sage.combinat.permutation.StandardPermutations_n.unrank)
is defined in terms of [from_rank](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/permutation.html#sage.combinat.permutation.from_rank).

I am aware of two ways in which this branch differs in behavior from what is there now.
They both seem to me to be because of bugs in the `EnumeratedSets` fallback implementations,
but I'll document them here in case complete compatibility is needed.

The first is that the existing
[rank](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py?h=9.1#n668)
method returns `None` when passed a list or a tuple,
because it uses `==` comparison with an `element_class` type
(I'm not sure how that works exactly, but at any rate it doesn't compare equal.)
To get `rank` to return something other than `None`, you have to pass in
a permutation produced by the `Permutations_mset` object itself.

```
sage: mset = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]
sage: p = Permutations(mset)
sage: p.rank(mset)
sage: p.rank([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9])
sage: p.unrank(3)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 5]
sage: type(p.unrank(3))
<class 'sage.combinat.permutation.Permutations_mset_with_category.element_class'>
sage: p.rank(p.unrank(3))
3
```

In this branch, the value passed to `rank` doesn't have to be an `element_class`.

```
sage: mset = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]
sage: p = Permutations(mset)
sage: p.rank(mset)
0
sage: p.rank([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9])
0
sage: p.unrank(3)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 5]
sage: type(p.unrank(3))
<class 'list'>
sage: p.rank(p.unrank(3))
3
```

The other way in which this branch changes behavior
is that the current code does not canonicalize the multiset
used to create the `Permutations_mset` object.
`Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4])` and `Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1])`
visit the same permutations but in a different order;
the latter acts like an already partially enumerated version of the former:

```
sage: Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]).unrank(0)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1]).unrank(0)
[3, 2, 1, 1, 4]
```

In this branch, the order of the input multiset does not make a difference:

```
sage: Permutations([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]).unrank(0)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: Permutations([3, 2, 1, 4, 1]).unrank(0)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

It would be possible to work around this canonicalization, if necessary,
by computing the rank of the input multiset on creation,
and using it as an offset for future calls to `unrank`.

I was working on a project that needed fast unranking of a multiset,
when I found that Sage could not handle a multiset of the size I needed.
I came up with [an algorithm](https://www.bamsoftware.com/comicrando/seed.html#algorithm)
that worked well enough for my purposes, however its ranking order is not lexicographic.
The algorithms in this branch are the result of a little more research
to find a lexicographic algorithm.

The documentation is not formatted correctly. Each time you insert a sentence or TEST between two blocks of tests, it should end with `::` unless there is another sentence just after.

I think that is a reasonable size; thank you.

I just have three more minor changes:

```diff
-        - ``p`` -- a permutation of `M`.
+        - ``p`` -- a permutation of `M`
```

```diff
         - ``r`` -- an integer between ``0`` and ``self.cardinality()-1``
-          inclusive.
+          inclusive
```
Update the Knuth reference based off #30005.

Something that is stylistic, so it is up to you if you want to change it, but I would change the

```
-Some sentence explanation. ::
+Some sentence explanation::
```
to have it end each block with a colon as the code is better associated with the sentence. However, that is something you can ignore.

Frédéric, do you have any other comments?

I made these changes in [​a694a35](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a694a352f26f0c6236334f485a6c0e7237eecabc).

It seems the right way to handle this is to remove the [REFERENCES](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/combinat/gray_codes.py?h=b45d5fb82ba163f5df09223cfc27327dd0b58f44#n4) section from gray_codes.py, containing the [Knuth-TAOCP4A] reference used in that file only, and update [Knuth-TAOCP4A] references to point to the new [https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst?id=a694a352f26f0c6236334f485a6c0e7237eecabc#n3216 "[Knu2011]"] in references/index.rst. But #30005 is not merged yet and [Knu2011] does not exist in its branch; while modifying gray_codes.py in this branch may prevent #30005 from merging cleanly. How should I handle this?

But #30005 is not merged yet and [Knu2011] does not exist in its branch; while modifying gray_codes.py in this branch may prevent #30005 from merging cleanly. How should I handle this?

You merge in the branch from #30005 into this one and set it as a dependency in the ticket. Actually, you probably should remove that reference on this ticket (again, after merging in #30005) and use the one in the master reference file.

Thanks for your guidance. I've merged #30005 into this branch and made it a dependency.

> Actually, you probably should remove that reference on this ticket (again, after merging in #30005) and use the one in the master reference file.

It was actually the other way around. It is this ticket (#29942) that adds a reference to the master reference file, and #30005 that used a REFERENCES section local to gray_codes.py. In [141f9a9](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/141f9a97c16facf1780bf14402915d68d814f354) I edited gray_codes.py to point to the master reference file.
