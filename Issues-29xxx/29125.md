Currently the inscription test for polyhedra depends on the order of vertices:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[-2,-1], [-2,1], [0,-1], [0,1]]).is_inscribed()
True
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[-2,-1], [-2,1], [0,-1], [0,1]], backend='field')
sage: P.is_inscribed()
False
sage: V = P.Vrepresentation()
sage: H = P.Hrepresentation()
sage: parent = P.parent()
sage: dic = {True: 0, False: 0}
sage: for V1 in Permutations(V):
....:     P1 = parent._element_constructor_(
....:         [V1, [], []], [H, []], Vrep_minimal=True, Hrep_minimal=True)
....:     dic[P1.is_inscribed()] += 1
....:     
sage: dic
{True: 18, False: 6}
```

The algorithm constructs a sphere around `dim + 1` vertices in general position. The circumcenter is computed up to sign. Then, one vertex is taken to determine, which sign to choose. However, up to `dim` vertices might lie on the intersection of both spheres.

We fix this by checking distance from the circumcenter for all vertices of that simplex.
