But it should be checked, as it need not be there in case of an external R.

Note: if one wants to ignore theses variables, it is possible to launch R with a parameter.


```
  --no-environ          Don't read the site and user environment files
  --no-site-file        Don't read the site-wide Rprofile
  --no-init-file        Don't read the user R profile
