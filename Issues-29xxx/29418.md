# Issue 29418: sage-download-file: Fix certificate problems with https downloads from upstream_url when sage-system-python is XCode's python3 on macOS

#26351 added an optional `upstream_url` field to `build/pkgs/*/checksums.ini`. It streamlines the procedure for testing upgrade tickets: Developers or automatic testing facilities can pass an extra flag `-o` to `sage-spkg` to allow downloading from upstream rather than from Sage mirrors (where the updated ticket will be made available later only).

Many upstream package URLs use the `https` protocol - in contrast to the `http` protocol used when downloading from the Sage mirrors. The downloading is done via `build/bin/sage-download-file`, which uses the `urllib` module. It supports the https protocol. 

However, SSL certificate problems are common on test systems. For example, if one uses XCode's `python3` as the system python, then `urllib` does not automatically uses the standard system certificates. (This is apparently a known issue -- which is considered "wontfix" by Apple as reported here:
https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues/2216#issuecomment-527114519)

We add an option `--no-check-certificate` to `sage-download-file`, disabling certificate checking (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36600583/python-3-urllib-ignore-ssl-certificate-verification).

Developers can set this option using the environment variable SAGE_DOWNLOAD_FILE_OPTIONS when installing packages (either by `make` or by using `sage -i`).

We note that even with SSL certificates disabled, there is still cryptographic protection because of the checksums recorded in `checksums.ini`.

---

Other possible workarounds considered:
- switching from using urllib directly to the requests library
- passing cafile=..., capath=... to urllib, perhaps coming from an environment variable
- using python instead of python3 on macOS as system python

As of #29090 (sage-system-python fixup) prefers `/usr/bin/python3` over `/usr/bin/python`, leading to:

```
  File "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/ssl.py", line 1117, in do_handshake
    self._sslobj.do_handshake()
OSError: [Errno socket error] [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1056)
```

Can't one get Python3 from python.org in MacOS by running a script?

If I run `bootstrap`, then running `./sage -i benzene` acts like `./sage -i tornado`: it doesn't install. There is a message

```
running ./configure '--enable-beautifulsoup4' '--enable-biopython'  '--enable-benzene'
```
and then if I search my terminal window for `benzene`, the only other hit is

```
benzene-20130630:                            does not support check for system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-benzene" to install
```

I don't think I tested #29113 well enough when I was reviewing it.

That's a correct description for macOS. But the problem also appears on Linux distributions if one does not install ca-certificates, or those are outdated.

Yes, I have been using this as part of #29417 since end of March.

That's correct for the macOS tests using `tox local`. For the Linux tests with `tox docker` note that `/upstream` is in `.gitignore` (therefore in `.dockerignore`) and is therefore not provided to the container.

> Also this flag would never be needed for a normal user as long as the sage mirrors don't use ssl?

That's right, normal users would not use the `upstream_url` at all; it is a feature for developers only.
