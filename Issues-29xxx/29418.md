# Issue 29418: sage-download-file: Fix certificate problems with https downloads from upstream_url when sage-system-python is XCode's python3 on macOS

#26351 added an optional `upstream_url` field to `build/pkgs/*/checksums.ini`. It streamlines the procedure for testing upgrade tickets: Developers or automatic testing facilities can pass an extra flag `-o` to `sage-spkg` to allow downloading from upstream rather than from Sage mirrors (where the updated ticket will be made available later only).

Many upstream package URLs use the `https` protocol - in contrast to the `http` protocol used when downloading from the Sage mirrors. The downloading is done via `build/bin/sage-download-file`, which uses the `urllib` module. It supports the https protocol. 

However, SSL certificate problems are common on test systems. For example, if one uses XCode's `python3` as the system python, then `urllib` does not automatically uses the standard system certificates. (This is apparently a known issue -- which is considered "wontfix" by Apple as reported here:
https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues/2216#issuecomment-527114519)

We add an option `--no-check-certificate` to `sage-download-file`, disabling certificate checking (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36600583/python-3-urllib-ignore-ssl-certificate-verification).

Developers can set this option using the environment variable SAGE_DOWNLOAD_FILE_OPTIONS when installing packages (either by `make` or by using `sage -i`).

We note that even with SSL certificates disabled, there is still cryptographic protection because of the checksums recorded in `checksums.ini`.

---

Other possible workarounds considered:
- switching from using urllib directly to the requests library
- passing cafile=..., capath=... to urllib, perhaps coming from an environment variable
- using python instead of python3 on macOS as system python

As of #29090 (sage-system-python fixup) prefers `/usr/bin/python3` over `/usr/bin/python`, leading to:

```
  File "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/ssl.py", line 1117, in do_handshake
    self._sslobj.do_handshake()
OSError: [Errno socket error] [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1056)
```

Sorry, I wasn't clear enough. What system configuration and commands lead to the problem in the description? I can't reproduce the problem, so I can't tell if the solution here works.

From what I understand this is a problem that only occurs when one has python3 from Xcode. This doesn't ship certify and never will (at least Apple doesn't have any intentions). So it is really difficult to establish an ssl connection with that.

Do you have successfully tested this ticket?

Do I understand correctly that the problem occurring could be theoretically fixed by manually downloading the correct packages into the upstream folder? (Yes this is not a good approach for testing environments.)

Also this flag would never be needed for a normal user as long as the sage mirrors don't use ssl?

That's a correct description for macOS. But the problem also appears on Linux distributions if one does not install ca-certificates, or those are outdated.

> Do you have successfully tested this ticket?

Yes, I have been using this as part of #29417 since end of March.

That's correct for the macOS tests using `tox local`. For the Linux tests with `tox docker` note that `/upstream` is in `.gitignore` (therefore in `.dockerignore`) and is therefore not provided to the container.

> Also this flag would never be needed for a normal user as long as the sage mirrors don't use ssl?

That's right, normal users would not use the `upstream_url` at all; it is a feature for developers only.
