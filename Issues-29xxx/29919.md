(from #29901)

... for packages like `database_stein_watkins` and `polytopes_db_4d`

Parts of `sage_bootstrap` know about this package type, but other scripts don't.

Our GH Actions scripts filter out these packages by name. This can be refactored.

With the present ticket, we can now say `sage --package list :optional: :experimental: --no-file huge` to filter out the huge packages.

Huge packages are now marked by the presence of the file `huge`; so this is actually orthogonal to the package type.

We also add files named `has_nonfree_dependencies` to some other packages so that they can be filtered out by the same mechanism.

I think we should have a cleaner way to add "tags" to packages, but in lieu of general solution this gets the job done.

The nonfree-dependencies thing is a bit of a legal mess. Users who install such a package lose the right to distribute their copy of sage. Entities such as universities may not want to wade into that sort of grey area. Anyway, that's orthogonal to this ticket.
