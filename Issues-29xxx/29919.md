(from #29901)

... for packages like `database_stein_watkins` and `polytopes_db_4d`

Parts of `sage_bootstrap` know about this package type, but other scripts don't.

Our GH Actions scripts filter out these packages by name. This can be refactored.

With the present ticket, we can now say `sage --package list :optional: :experimental: --no-file huge` to filter out the huge packages.

Huge packages are now marked by the presence of the file `huge`; so this is actually orthogonal to the package type.

We also add files named `has_nonfree_dependencies` to some other packages so that they can be filtered out by the same mechanism.
