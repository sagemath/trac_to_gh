The `i386-minimal` targets have build errors compiling `gfortran` (see for example https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/463683795) because of ABI mismatch. These tests are running 32-bit distributions on a 64-bit kernel. `gfortran` tries to build native (64-bit) but that fails because the corresponding architecture files are missing.

The form `$(command)` should be preferred over backticks here (http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082).

And if you explicitly want to call GCC here, shouldn't you use "gcc" instead of $CC?

No, this needs to run the specific compiler that is configured!

Well, clang supports the `-dumpmachine` option too.

I have not tested with icc; I don't know if Sage is known to build at all with this compiler.

<a id='comment:26'></a>There's some evidence (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/9145) that icc supports this option too on Linux (but possibly not on macOS - which is not a problem because 32-bit builds are no longer supported; and the fallback to `unknown` should take care of it).
