The `i386-minimal` targets have build errors compiling `gfortran` (see for example https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/463683795) because of ABI mismatch. These tests are running 32-bit distributions on a 64-bit kernel. `gfortran` tries to build native (64-bit) but that fails because the corresponding architecture files are missing.

I'll have to take your word for it that this fixes the problem. Some implementation nitpicks:

```
ARCH=`$CC -dumpmachine 2>/dev/null || echo unknown`
```

The form `$(command)` should be preferred over backticks here (http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082).

And if you explicitly want to call GCC here, shouldn't you use "gcc" instead of $CC?

```
    x86_64,i[3-6]86*)
```

Personally I would just write `[3456]` there. Ranges in globs are a bash extension, but more importantly they involve the system locale and collation, leading to rare problems that can be avoided by just listing the numbers you want to match.

No, this needs to run the specific compiler that is configured!

Well, clang supports the `-dumpmachine` option too.

I have not tested with icc; I don't know if Sage is known to build at all with this compiler.

Ok, that makes sense. I was focusing on the `bits/libc-header-start.h: No such file or directory` errors. I guess we could still get build failures if GCC is 32-bit but someone has built a 64-bit clang and sets `CC=clang`. These are pretty low return-on-investment scenarios, though. Feel free to set positive review if the CI and build bots are happy.

I agree. If this ever becomes a problem, this can be fixed separately.
