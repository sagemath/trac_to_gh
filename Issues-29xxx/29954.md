#29935 discovered unstable plotting with doctests. This causes the following failures:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=319106504607147180164974137764334084020 src/doc/en/prep/Symbolics-and-Basic-Plotting.rst  # 2 doctests failed

sage -t --long --warn-long 85.2 --random-seed=123134235245245234 src/sage/combinat/sine_gordon.py  # 1 doctest failed

```

In all of those instances, primitives where split into two (with a hole).

To reproduce

```
sage: f(x)=x^3+1

```

```

sage: plot(cos(x),(x,0,pi/2),fill=True,ticks=[[0,pi/4,pi/2],None],tick_formatter=pi)
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 3 graphics primitives
```

```
sage: set_random_seed(319106504607147180164974137764334084020)
sage: plot(sin(x), (x,0,2*pi))

Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
sage: plot(sin(x), (x,0,2*pi))
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 2 graphics primitives
```

```
sage: set_random_seed(319106504607147180164974137764334084020)
sage: plot([x^n for n in [2..6]],(x,0,1))
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 6 graphics primitives
sage: plot([x^n for n in [2..6]],(x,0,1))
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 5 graphics primitives
```

```
sage: set_random_seed(123134235245245234)
sage: Y = SineGordonYsystem('A',(6,4,3))
sage: Y.plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 220 graphics primitives
sage: Y.plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 221 graphics primitives
sage: Y.plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 221 graphics primitives
sage: Y.plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 219 graphics primitives
```

This is caused by #13246, which adds exclusion points in the plot, whenever two x-values are far apart. However, it seems more natural to actually keep track of those points where the computation failed.

I think I have seen such sporadic plotting errors in the wild.

It's not like I tried many random seeds.

For the first one, your chance is about 99 percent to get it right. The more complicated your object, the lower the chance obviously. For the last object, it appears to be about 64 percent. Of course, it is much harder to see the mistake there.

I think this will be easy to fix.  In fact, this PR may solve the problem, but I think we should do something more intelligent.

The problem is a bug in the adaptive graphing code. It assumes that if two consecutive plot points `a` and `b` are more than twice as far apart as the average distance between consecutive plot points, then there is a problem and we should not plot anything between `a` and `b`. However, the distance between consecutive plot points will be very large in any region where the graph is close to being linear, so the algorithm can erroneously add gaps to the graph in those regions.

This PR just changes "twice as far apart" to "five times as far apart". It seems to fix all of the examples listed above. But it should be easy to write a more intelligent patch that only puts gaps in regions where there is a problem evaluating the function.

Thanks for figuring out the problem.

The whole fix in #13246 seems strange to me and needs serious reworking:

```
plot(1/(x+1), -3, 1, plot_points=500)
```

```
plot(tan(x), -3, 3)
```

This is awful and `-infinity` and `+infinity` should never be connected. Here the `y-value` is too far apart to connect it and this isn't checked at all.

I don't like the approach done in #13246 for the following reasons:

`adaptive_refinement` distinguishes between not returning anything, because the `y-values` are close enough together and not returning anything because either recursion depth was exceeded or there was a computation error. Also `generate_plot_points` collects the exception indices.

However, none of this already collected information is returned by `generate_plot_points` and we completely start over trying to guess, where to add exclusion points. I mean `generate_plot_points` and `adaptive_refinement` have already figured out, where the those things should be.

As you mentioned above, in our case `adaptive_refinement` just doesn't refine, because this thing is close to linear and thus `adaptive_refinement` thinks things are fine. We should use this information and not discard it.

It think this will also fix the errornous connection made above.

Actually, `adaptive_refinement` fails quite a lot. I think this is, because it takes the absolute error instead of a relative one.

But, I don't think its okay to just connect things were `adaptive_refinement` fails, this is a really bad default in my opinion.

```
sage: f(x) = (floor(x)+0.5) / (1-(x-0.5)^2)                                                                                                                                         
sage: plot(f, (x, -3.5, 3.5), ymin=-5, ymax=5)                                                                                                                                      
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```

This thing isn't continuous and the only way to fix it, is to manually enter the points to exclude. However, the current code does a pretty good job in detecting those places, we just currently ignore everything that was obtained.

Thanks, this is excellent!  I do have a few minor suggestions, though:

Would it be better to make `excluded` a keyword-only argument? (By changing `excluded=False` to `*, excluded=False` in the definitions of `adaptive_refinement` and `generate_plot_points`.)

These two lines (the definitions of `adaptive_refinement` and `generate_plot_points`) are  excessively long, so please add a line break before the 80th character.

In the docstring of `adaptive_refinement`, the description of `excluded` in the "INPUT" section makes it sound like two lists will be returned ("add a list of discovered points"). So I think it would be better to say something like: "also return locations where it has been discovered that the function is not defined". (Or "locations where" could be changed to "x-values at which".)

The term "point" usually refers to an ordered pair `(x,y)` in the documentation of this file, so it is confusing when it is used to refer to a value of x.  Therefore, in the description of `excluded` in the "OUTPUT" section of the docstring for `adaptive_refinement`, please change this to something like: "if `excluded`, then x-values for which the calculation failed are included in the list, with ``'NaN'`` as the y-value.

For the same reason, in the INPUT section of the docstring for `generate_plot_points`, please change "a list of discovered points, for which" to "a list of discovered x-values, at which".  And in the new doctest of this method, please change "Excluded points" to "Excluded x-values".

The term "value" usually refers to a value of the function, or, in other words, a y-value, so I find it confusing when this word is used for a value of x.  Therefore, in the OUTPUT section of the docstring for `generate_plot_points`, please change "a list of not-defined values" to something like "a list of x-values at which the function is not defined". Please also change the name of the variable `values` to `x_values` (or something similar). 

The file sometimes has two blank lines after "INPUT:" or "OUTPUT:", and sometimes only one.  Please standardize this, even though this was not your fault. (I think there is only supposed to be one.)

(Let me know if you would like me to make these changes to the file for you.)
