Sage needs `boost_cropped`, not all of `boost`. The `boost` tarball is ten times the size, `boost_cropped` took 8 seconds to build on my machine, and `boost` took 21 minutes. So if by "historical" you mean before this ticket, I guess "historical arfifact" is accurate.

I don't understand what I am supposed to reproduce. I think an optional package only gets installed if its installation is explicitly triggered by `make` or `sage -i`, and not merely because `./configure` was not able to find a system copy.
