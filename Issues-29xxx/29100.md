Works for me on Gentoo but it's a little scary to have the check for boost implicitly be the check for boost_cropped. It would be nice if the new macro result was cached -- then we could just repeat the check -- but I don't think it is.

Maybe check `HAVE_BOOST` as a safety net against changes to boost_cropped? I dunno.

Sage needs `boost_cropped`, not all of `boost`. The `boost` tarball is ten times the size, `boost_cropped` took 8 seconds to build on my machine, and `boost` took 21 minutes. So if by "historical" you mean before this ticket, I guess "historical arfifact" is accurate.

According to `spkg-src`, `boost_cropped` is obtained from `boost` by just taking the subdirectory `boost` (i.e., `boost_1_66_0/boost`).

I'm almost positive the cropped version is a pure Sage invention, to cut down on size and to speed up building.

```
