Works for me on Gentoo but it's a little scary to have the check for boost implicitly be the check for boost_cropped. It would be nice if the new macro result was cached -- then we could just repeat the check -- but I don't think it is.

Maybe check `HAVE_BOOST` as a safety net against changes to boost_cropped? I dunno.

Sage needs `boost_cropped`, not all of `boost`. The `boost` tarball is ten times the size, `boost_cropped` took 8 seconds to build on my machine, and `boost` took 21 minutes. So if by "historical" you mean before this ticket, I guess "historical arfifact" is accurate.

I don't know how `boost_cropped` was created, at least `spkg-src` provides no clue.

I don't know a modern Linux distro that supplies such a "cropped" thing.

According to `spkg-src`, `boost_cropped` is obtained from `boost` by just taking the subdirectory `boost` (i.e., `boost_1_66_0/boost`).

I'm almost positive the cropped version is a pure Sage invention, to cut down on size and to speed up building.

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment:11):
> I think I see what happened. The sage library doesn't need boost at all, the boost spkg is optional. But the spkg-configure.m4 for boost causes it to be installed whenever a system copy is not present.
> 
> Instead, I think we should leave boost alone (why is it an optional package to begin with?). The spkg-configure.m4 for boost_cropped should look for a full version of boost, like it does now. And then if someone decides to install the optional boost spkg... who cares what happens.

I don't understand what I am supposed to reproduce. I think an optional package only gets installed if its installation is explicitly triggered by `make` or `sage -i`, and not merely because `./configure` was not able to find a system copy.

Ok, I'm going to put it back to positive review then. I'm not willing to delete boost at the moment to see what happens.

The check for boost_cropped now looks even more correct to me, since that's the standard package. My comment about boost's spkg-configure.m4 no longer applies, it isn't standard and doesn't need to be detected.

Sorry, false alarm: I tested with some other packages. If I uninstall the optional gp2c, for example...

```
./configure
...
checking SPKGs to install... 
    ...
    gmp-6.1.2 will not be installed (configure check)
    gmpy2-2.1.0b1
    gp2c-0.0.10.p0
    ...
```

That sure looks like gp2c will be installed from the spkg. That message combined with John's comment made me think for a minute that a full copy of boost was being installed in addition to (or in lieu of) boost_cropped.
