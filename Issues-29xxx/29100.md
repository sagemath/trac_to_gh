Works for me on Gentoo but it's a little scary to have the check for boost implicitly be the check for boost_cropped. It would be nice if the new macro result was cached -- then we could just repeat the check -- but I don't think it is.

Maybe check `HAVE_BOOST` as a safety net against changes to boost_cropped? I dunno.

Sage needs `boost_cropped`, not all of `boost`. The `boost` tarball is ten times the size, `boost_cropped` took 8 seconds to build on my machine, and `boost` took 21 minutes. So if by "historical" you mean before this ticket, I guess "historical arfifact" is accurate.

I don't know a modern Linux distro that supplies such a "cropped" thing.

According to `spkg-src`, `boost_cropped` is obtained from `boost` by just taking the subdirectory `boost` (i.e., `boost_1_66_0/boost`).

I'm almost positive the cropped version is a pure Sage invention, to cut down on size and to speed up building.

I don't understand what I am supposed to reproduce. I think an optional package only gets installed if its installation is explicitly triggered by `make` or `sage -i`, and not merely because `./configure` was not able to find a system copy.

Sorry, false alarm: I tested with some other packages. If I uninstall the optional gp2c, for example...

```
./configure
...
checking SPKGs to install... 
    ...
    gmp-6.1.2 will not be installed (configure check)
    gmpy2-2.1.0b1
    gp2c-0.0.10.p0
    ...
```

That sure looks like gp2c will be installed from the spkg. That message combined with John's comment made me think for a minute that a full copy of boost was being installed in addition to (or in lieu of) boost_cropped.
