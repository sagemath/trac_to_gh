SQLite is another package that many people will have installed (firefox uses it, for example) and that has few dependencies in Sage (only readline). 

libsqlite3 is used by Python during its build. Some Python packages need sufficiently new versions. We set the lower bound slightly lower than the current version available on XCode.

We detect it using `AC_RUN_IFELSE` because on macOS without homebrew, there is no pkgconfig file.

I don't think we need such a new version, but 3.29.0 (from 2019-07-10) is the oldest one in Gentoo that I can test against. Should we accept versions back to 3.27 or 3.16 (or further) for Debian?

could you make the minimal version 3.20? Otherwise, all good. (I modified the version being 3.20 and tested with such sqlite)

On Fedora the packages are named `sqlite` and `sqlite-devel` - these ought to be listed in the corresponding docs - perhaps on another ticket.

For now, the sage sqlite package depends on readline, so the dep check is the right thing to do.

But, if sage doesn't care whether or not sqlite was built with readline support, then why don't we build it without readline support and remove the dependency from the spkg? Afterwards we would drop the dep check here, too, and everything would work out.

To my understanding, PKG_CHECK_MODULES is used to guard specifically against link-time confusion of libraries and their dependencies.

Actually, the `sqlite3` on macOS is fully functional - it just provides command line editing through `libedit`, not `libreadline`.

Yeah, the lower bound is at 3.20 right now.

Ok, I agree. The dependency on readline *replaces* a dependency on editline (you have to pick one), so simply dropping the dependency from the sqlite package is not the option I thought it was. Moreover, readline/editline accomplish the same thing, so the dep check is counterproductive here.

My bad, it turns out I didn't have libsqlite3-dev installed (thought I did).  After that I have the .pc file.  Still would be nice to have a fallback though if possible.

Does the MacOS version (without homebrew) also install the library and development headers? Otherwise we'd be adding a fallback for nobody.

If we wind up digging through headers and libraries anyway, the pkg-config check becomes redundant.

Everything we do in these spkg-configure files is a bit questionable =)

Basically we're trying to fake the checks that already (or should already) take place in the upstream packages, but as simply and with as little code as possible.

As far as I can tell, you can cover the known cases with a combination of `AC_CHECK_HEADER([sqlite3.h],...)` and `AC_SEARCH_LIBS([(sqlite3_libversion],[sqlite3],...)`. That's still not perfect, because it doesn't check for every function that python uses, but if it works for the people CC'ed on this ticket it will probably work for everyone.

There's no reason to keep the PKG_CHECK_MODULES around at that point. If the first test works sometimes and the second test works all the time, why try both?

My point about the version check is that your program is currently doing four things:

1. Ensuring that sqlite3.h is in the include path.
2. Ensuring that the `sqlite3_libversion()` function is in the `sqlite3` library.
3. Doing some math to see if the version of sqlite3 is newer than 3.8.7.

That's all good, but the third item is superfluous since we don't really care what version of sqlite3 you have (so long as it works). And if you remove the version check, then items 1, 2, and 4 can all be accomplished with AC_CHECK_HEADER and AC_SEARCH_LIBS in three or four lines.

The version of sqlite3 for a python build was an issue as recently as 2017 here:
https://bugs.python.org/issue29098

I don't have time to determine a more precise bound. But we do need to check *some* lower bound for the version (or test features of sqlite3).

They changed that code so that older versions of sqlite will work.

Python doesn't do a version check, and doesn't document any version bounds, so presumably all of them.

Put another way: if we find a version that makes it past *our* version-less check but that breaks python... then that's a python bug.

You make it sound so negative =)

**If** there's a version of sqlite that doesn't work with python, and **if** someone tries to build sage with it (both unlikely), then we report the bug upstream. At that point -- depending on the upstream fix -- we either do nothing or amend this spkg-configure with a lower bound.

Otherwise, we're just making things complicated for no ostensible reason. Since nobody is going to test every 3.x version of sqlite, we're still ultimately guessing at the lower version bound. My guess just happens to be 3.0.0.

If it's wrong, we can change it, but 3.0.0 is more likely to be correct than any other untested bound, and simplifies this check as a bonus.

So I am for keeping a version check. 

One other thing - for better of worse, spkg-configure.m4 in other packages undefine local m4 variables they happen to define, whereas here it does not happen.
They use `m4_pushdef/m4_popdef` pair of macros for these purposes.

to support one version of sqlite on one proprietary OS whose maintainers went out of their way to delete an important file from the package.

sagelib doesn't even use sqlite, it's a dependency of a dependency

HAHA :)

I'm also +1 for keeping the version check; personally I would lower the minimum version 3.0.0 until/unless a stronger minimum is actually determined.  But 3.8.7 is still old-enough that it should be satisfied on most system so I'm okay with it.

It turns out there are some tests that fail if the sqlite3 executable is not installed:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 78.2 src/sage/tests/cmdline.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 608, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    out.startswith("3.")
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 610, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    err
Expected:
    ''
Got:
    '/home/sage/sage/src/bin/sage: line 546: exec: sqlite3: not found\n'
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 612, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    ret
Expected:
    0
Got:
    127
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   3 of 236 in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
    [235 tests, 3 failures, 45.53 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 78.2 src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So, technically it is a regression of `sage -sqlite3` does not work.  I don't think this is very important functionality and it would probably be better if it were slowly deprecated (I think the same should be the case for most `sage -<program name>`--rather, that most of those should be undocumented, and that there should be a generic interface for running executables that might be installed in the Sage distribution).

In the meantime, I'm leaning towards we need to check for it...

Indeed. I just got bitten by this (trying to ebuild 9.1.beta2 from scratch rather than upgrading).

I tend to disagree : an unsuspecting user might have a hard time to understand why "our" version replaces the one he/she installed in his/her system if he/she runs out utility that installs system shortcuts for Sage-installed programs  ...

Indeed. But since `sqlite` is so widely used, we might alsoi depend on the relevant packages (easy for Unices, possibly not so easy for Windows (Madison ?), and possible Apple shenanigans...).

BTW, our move to reduce the size of Sage-the-distribution should reopen the question of what are our minimal dependencies. I would have no problem to depend on `sqlite`, more on `Maxima` (Lisp interpreters !) and even more on `R` (size, dependencies on OpenSSL, etc...)

Should that be disciussed on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel) ?

In the meantime, should we open a new ticket ?

In the long run there should be no sqlite or libsqlite bundled into Sage.

I won't worry too much about R, as it's already more or less sorted.
Maxima/ECL is harder, as it's tigher integrated into Sage, and as ECL is moving very slowly nowadays (and with significant changes to come).

yes, please, for deprecating/removing `sage -FOO` functionality for `FOO=sqlite` and other values like this, right?

@embray Thanks for spotting this and for opening the follow-up ticket:
- #29092 sqlite3 CLI executable should be checked for at configure time
I agree that this needs to be fixed.
