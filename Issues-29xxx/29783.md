If I want to do simple check whether or not element of SR in NumberField like this:

```
sage: FF = NumberField(x^2+1, 'z')                                                                                                                             
sage: x^2 in FF   
```

I get the error:

```
/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py in symbol(self, ex)
    318             NotImplementedError: symbol
    319         """
--> 320         raise NotImplementedError("symbol")
    321 
    322     def relation(self, ex, operator):

NotImplementedError: symbol
```

It doesn't seem like behavior expected by user. Because for example it works as expected in case of QQ:

```
sage: x^2 in QQ                                                                                                                                                
False
```
