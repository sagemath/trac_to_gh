It is unnecessarily confusing that `build/bin/sage-spkg` transforms the template `spkg-install` to an executable script that is *also* called `spkg-install`.

This ticket renames all `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*` of packages other than `type=script` (which are regular executable shell scripts already) to `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*.in`.

In addition to the increased clarity, this is preparation for #29122 (Build packages in `build/pkgs/SPKG/src`, not `SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build/SPKG-...`).

They are already distinguished by the fact that they are not marked executable.  If you really want to make a distinction, you can have the files output by `sage-spkg` have a different name, but that's not much clearer.  It's nice when debugging a build directory to have the output `spkg-install` just work.

In fact, come to think of it, these files are not even *templates*.  The *template* is the code in `sage-spkg`:

```
write_script_wrapper() {
    local script="$1"
    local script_dir="$2"

    trap "echo >&2 Error: Unexpected error writing wrapper script for $script; exit \$_" ERR

    if head -1 "$script" | grep '^#!.*$' >/dev/null; then
        echo >&2 "Error: ${script##*/} should not contain a shebang line; it will be prepended automatically."
        exit 1
    fi

    local tmpscript="$(dirname "$script")/.tmp-${script##*/}"

    cat > "$tmpscript" <<__EOF__
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export SAGE_ROOT="$SAGE_ROOT"
export SAGE_SRC="$SAGE_SRC"

    if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: failed to source \$lib"
        echo >&2 "Is \$SAGE_ROOT the correct SAGE_ROOT?"
        exit 1
    fi
done

sdh_guard
if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: sdh_guard not found; Sage environment was not set up properly"
    exit 1
fi

cd "\$SAGE_PKG_DIR"

    echo >&2 "Error: could not cd to the package build directory \$SAGE_PKG_DIR"

fi

__EOF__

    cat "$script" >> "$tmpscript"
    mv "$tmpscript" "$script"

    trap - ERR
}
```

That's the template.  The files in `build/pkg/*/spkg-*` are not templates.  They are snippets that are interpolated into that template.

there are `build/pkgs/*/spkg-install` files which are proper shell scripts (for spkgs which are of type `script`).
One should make them namewise-distinct from templates, e.g. as done on this branch, or by appending `.sh` to them.

as I explained in [comment:23](#comment:23), some of these files are scripts, and some (most) are not.

The invasive change happened when most of these files stopped being scripts, so this ticket merely sets the record straight.

You are using the word "invasive" differently than the rest of us, I think. I just mean: it touches a lot of files.

Anyway, it's nice to see everyone so entrenched in their positions.
