It is unnecessarily confusing that `build/bin/sage-spkg` transforms the template `spkg-install` to an executable script that is *also* called `spkg-install`.

This ticket renames all `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*` of packages other than `type=script` (which are regular executable shell scripts already) to `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-*.in`.

In addition to the increased clarity, this is preparation for #29122 (Build packages in `build/pkgs/SPKG/src`, not `SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build/SPKG-...`).

Also disruptive: Mass file rename which makes any pending tickets updating SPKGs invalid.  Might also break other existing scripts, etc.  Unless there is a serious problem this is solving it seems way overboard.

They are already distinguished by the fact that they are not marked executable.  If you really want to make a distinction, you can have the files output by `sage-spkg` have a different name, but that's not much clearer.  It's nice when debugging a build directory to have the output `spkg-install` just work.

In fact, come to think of it, these files are not even *templates*.  The *template* is the code in `sage-spkg`:

```
write_script_wrapper() {
    local script="$1"
    local script_dir="$2"

    trap "echo >&2 Error: Unexpected error writing wrapper script for $script; exit \$_" ERR

    if head -1 "$script" | grep '^#!.*$' >/dev/null; then
        echo >&2 "Error: ${script##*/} should not contain a shebang line; it will be prepended automatically."
        exit 1
    fi

    local tmpscript="$(dirname "$script")/.tmp-${script##*/}"

    cat > "$tmpscript" <<__EOF__
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export SAGE_ROOT="$SAGE_ROOT"
export SAGE_SRC="$SAGE_SRC"
export SAGE_PKG_DIR="$script_dir"
export SAGE_SPKG_SCRIPTS="$SAGE_SPKG_SCRIPTS"

export PKG_NAME="$PKG_NAME"
export PKG_BASE="$PKG_BASE"
export PKG_VER="$PKG_VER"

for lib in "\$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-dist-helpers" "\$SAGE_SRC/bin/sage-env" "\$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-build-env-config"; do
    source "\$lib"
    if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: failed to source \$lib"
        echo >&2 "Is \$SAGE_ROOT the correct SAGE_ROOT?"
        exit 1
    fi
done

sdh_guard
if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: sdh_guard not found; Sage environment was not set up properly"
    exit 1
fi

cd "\$SAGE_PKG_DIR"
if [ \$? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: could not cd to the package build directory \$SAGE_PKG_DIR"
    exit 1
fi

__EOF__

    cat "$script" >> "$tmpscript"
    mv "$tmpscript" "$script"
    chmod +x "$script"

    trap - ERR
}
```

That's the template.  The files in `build/pkg/*/spkg-*` are not templates.  They are snippets that are interpolated into that template.

there are `build/pkgs/*/spkg-install` files which are proper shell scripts (for spkgs which are of type `script`).
One should make them namewise-distinct from templates, e.g. as done on this branch, or by appending `.sh` to them.

You are using the word "invasive" differently than the rest of us, I think. I just mean: it touches a lot of files.
