#29562  broke the `gfortran` build in `homebrew-macos-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/624417033):

```
Checking LIBRARY_PATH variable... contains current directory
configure: error: 
*** LIBRARY_PATH shouldn't contain the current directory when
*** building gcc. Please change the environment variable
*** and run configure again.
```


#29562 also broke `flint`/`singular` on `homebrew` when conflicting versions of libraries are in `/usr/local`, leading to doctest errors and segfaults such as this one:

```

The error can be reproduced in the standard homebrew environment set up by `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest`.

I am now trying with ` EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-mp=mpir" tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest` to disable use of homebrew's GMP.

Any help with debugging this would be very welcome!

Note that tox installs its own copy of homebrew, independent of the one in /usr/local.

> (The comment in `tox.ini` says "Install all known system packages equivalent to standard packages that have spkg-configure.m4", but it must actually require both an spkg-configure.m4 and distros/homebrew.txt, right?)


Right, with this clarification it describes correctly the behavior for the `docker-....` environments. For `local-homebrew`, however, the implementation cheats a little bit (fixing this is one of the tasks of #29146). See line 323 of `tox.ini` to see how the system package list is determined:

```
    homebrew-standard:   bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/*/distros/homebrew.txt`; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew install $PACKAGES; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew upgrade $PACKAGES'
```
So it really just installs every package listed in any `homebrew.txt`

Which file do you want? One of the ones in `logs`?

```

Standard configure scripts do not deal with `/usr/local` specifically at all but only check what the compiler/linker is able to find.
The changes to the spkg-configure scripts for FLINT and arb only work around nonstandard behavior of their configure scripts.

Look at the configure scripts of FLINT and arb. They are putting `/usr/local` explicitly in the compiler and linker lines as -I and -L flags. This overrides correct paths that are configured by the user's CPATH and -I options etc.

No, not "unconditionally", which is exactly why this ticket is able to fix it by providing options to that configure script.

From the diff:

```
+# Trac #29607: We must always supply --with-gmp, --with-mpfr,
+# --with-flint because otherwise ARB's configure script uses
+# /usr/local, which is always wrong.
+# This is why we do not use $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP etc. here.
+# The value $SAGE_LOCAL is always a safe choice even if the library
+# is coming from the system and is found using what is in
+# LIBRARY_PATH or LDFLAGS etc.
```
