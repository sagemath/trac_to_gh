#29562  broke the `gfortran` build in `homebrew-macos-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/624417033):

```
Checking LIBRARY_PATH variable... contains current directory
configure: error: 
*** LIBRARY_PATH shouldn't contain the current directory when
*** building gcc. Please change the environment variable
*** and run configure again.
```


#29562 also broke `flint`/`singular` on `homebrew` when conflicting versions of libraries are in `/usr/local`, leading to doctest errors and segfaults such as this one:

```

The error can be reproduced in the standard homebrew environment set up by `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest`.

I am now trying with ` EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-mp=mpir" tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest` to disable use of homebrew's GMP.

Any help with debugging this would be very welcome!

Note that tox installs its own copy of homebrew, independent of the one in /usr/local.

> (The comment in `tox.ini` says "Install all known system packages equivalent to standard packages that have spkg-configure.m4", but it must actually require both an spkg-configure.m4 and distros/homebrew.txt, right?)

Right, with this clarification it describes correctly the behavior for the `docker-....` environments. For `local-homebrew`, however, the implementation cheats a little bit (fixing this is one of the tasks of #29146). See line 323 of `tox.ini` to see how the system package list is determined:

```
    homebrew-standard:   bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/*/distros/homebrew.txt`; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew install $PACKAGES; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew upgrade $PACKAGES'
```
So it really just installs every package listed in any `homebrew.txt`

Do you happen to have NTL from homebrew installed in `/usr/local` (`brew info ntl`)?

The present ticket *is* changing what #29562 did.

> I don't understand that `/usr/local` being "always wrong".

Look at the configure scripts of FLINT and arb. They are putting `/usr/local` explicitly in the compiler and linker lines as -I and -L flags. This overrides correct paths that are configured by the user's CPATH and -I options etc.

> What if I install GMP there and want to build Sage using it?

Yes, this still works. We do this on homebrew all the time.

No, not "unconditionally", which is exactly why this ticket is able to fix it by providing options to that configure script.

From the diff:

```
+# Trac #29607: We must always supply --with-gmp, --with-mpfr,
+# --with-flint because otherwise ARB's configure script uses
+# /usr/local, which is always wrong.
+# This is why we do not use $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP etc. here.
+# The value $SAGE_LOCAL is always a safe choice even if the library
+# is coming from the system and is found using what is in
+# LIBRARY_PATH or LDFLAGS etc.
