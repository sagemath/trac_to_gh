According to the ticket #26349, the bug should have been fixed in Release 9.1, but the provided code 

```
n = 8
X = zero_vector(GF(2), n)
M = zero_matrix(GF(2), n, n)

for _ in range(10000000):
    Y = M * X
```
still leaks memory (using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS). There is no error message when trying to execute, but the memory consumption increases until the process crashes.

Okay, here is the problem:

```sage
        c._init(self._nrows, VS)
        c._entries = mzd_init(1, self._nrows)
```
The `c._init` already allocates `c._entries`. So this does a double allocation, and so the old allocation from `c._init` is the leak.
