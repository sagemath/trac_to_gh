Old-style SPKGs were deprecated in #19158 — see also #19267 — merged in Sage 6.9.

In this ticket, we remove the documentation in the Developer's Guide that describes how to create these packages.

A helper script for creating these packages is removed in #29383.

#29289 is the separate ticket for removing support for **installing** old-style SPKGs.
