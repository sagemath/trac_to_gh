Thanks for doing this.

One small comment (and I apologize if this is noise) is that the code seems to give an error on 0-dimensional polytopes (i.e., a single vertex), even though they have an obvious centroid. (One reason for the error seems to be that sage cannot triangulate them. Should this be considered a bug?)

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1.0,2.0)], base_ring=RDF)
sage: P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.centroid()

I opened some tickets because of small cases. They should work.

In case of empty polyhedron, there should be a reasonable error as well.
I'm passing the case of d+1 vertices down to `center` now.

`affine_hull` is deprecated. Use `affine_hull_projection` instead.

The following code should appear before the INPUT/OUTPUT I think

```diff
+        If the polyhedron is not compact, a ``NotImplementedError`` is
+        raised.
```

Otherwise, it looks good. It might benefit from a rebase just to have clean bots go through it.
