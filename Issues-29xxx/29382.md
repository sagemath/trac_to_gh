<a id='comment:7'></a>Thanks for doing this.

One small comment (and I apologize if this is noise) is that the code seems to give an error on 0-dimensional polytopes (i.e., a single vertex), even though they have an obvious centroid. (One reason for the error seems to be that sage cannot triangulate them. Should this be considered a bug?)

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1.0,2.0)], base_ring=RDF)
sage: P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.centroid()
