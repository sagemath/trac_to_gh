There's currently a limit to the length of text that can be displayed in the Three.js viewer before the text starts getting clipped at either end.

I've updated threejs_template.html so that the dimensions of the underlying texture are set based on the fontsize and length of the text instead of being hard-coded to 128x32 pixels.

I made sure to keep the pixel scaling intact and to continue using powers of two for the dimensions to prevent the text from becoming blurry. I also tried to keep the resulting size of the text onscreen the same before and after the change with some scale factors.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 using a standard display as well as on Windows 10 using a high-DPI display.

An example that would result in clipping before:

```
p1 = text3d("Hello world, how are you doing today?", (10, 20, 30))
p2 = text3d("Just fine! Thanks for asking!", (-30, -20, -10))
show(p1 + p2, projection='perspective')

Also since you have the proper equipment, please make sure #24601 doesn't resurface in the context of these changes. Thanks!

I'm not aware of an existing ticket, nor could I find one with a quick search, but this is something I've also been contemplating recently. 

The MathJax library seems to be already included in Sage and the Jupyter notebook, so I don't think it would be much effort to get some LaTeX rendered *on the page*. The problem is getting it rendered *in the scene* so that it moves around / rotates / zooms with everything else in the scene.

We'd need an HTML canvas or a raster image that can be drawn on an HTML canvas in order to put the text in the scene, but with my current understanding of MathJax (admittedly little), it doesn't support either of those as output formats.

It *does* support SVG output, though, so perhaps we have a chance of then rendering that into a canvas using [an approach like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5495952/draw-svg-on-html5-canvas-with-support-for-font-element). There's also the [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) library that might be able to go straight from the MathJax HTML output to canvas as mentioned in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20852529/rendering-mathjax-output-on-canvas/32528821#32528821).

I'll do some more research into it and see if I can get a working example going.

Sorry for replying to an old ticket, but for completeness's sake: the `fontsize` parameter is being made use of as of #30614.
