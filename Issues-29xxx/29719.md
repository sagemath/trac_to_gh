OK, I ended up using arb patch: ​https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/commit/d3d9983231e0f034e86a1e75761627eb8213b704.patch
with arb 2.16.0 (the arb version in Sage now), and get one flint-related regression (a segfault)

Dima, thanks for reporting the Arb doctest failures.

The slight regressions in accuracy for elliptic_pi, elliptic_pi_inc and elliptic_rj are due to using a different algorithm to compute the R_J function for certain complex parameters. The new algorithm is a bit slower and less accurate, but unlike the old algorithm always gives the right branch. These doctest results just need to be updated.

Unfortunately, the new algorithm doesn't work when phi is an inexact multiple of pi/2, leading to the NaN values. There is a workaround: acb_elliptic_pi_inc takes a pi flag to multiply the argument by pi exactly, so if you add a pi flag to the Sage wrapper and pass in phi=0.5 with pi=True in the doctest, it should give the expected result.

It's theoretically possible to fix these regressions, and I will open an Arb issue for it, but I'm not keen to spend time on it any time soon.

The other two examples look correct: converting an Arb number to an MPFR now rounds according to MPFR semantics (including rounding to infinity) instead of abort()ing when the exponents are out of range for MPFR.

OK, so this seems to be a basic `Polynomial_zmod_flint` problem:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: Q=x^5 - 2*x + 3
sage: Qm=Q.change_ring(Integers(5**4))
sage: F=4*Qm
sage: F.gcd(F.derivative())
Flint exception (Impossible inverse):
    Cannot invert modulo 5*0
-------------------------
boom...
```

(this happily returns `1` with Flint 2.5.2)

So this is not really a specific p-adic problem at all.

Of course we must fix it before the next release, but not everything can be done within one beta. We need to do LOTS of package upgrades!

In particular, a big Normaliz update is coming. Not sure if Winfried is already testing with the new FLINT release?

I had not noticed that Flint 2.6.0 is available. Therefore it is not installed with Normaliz 3.8.5 that was just released (not a big release). 

As soon as possible, I will test Flint 2.6.0. I need the backport to the 0 series of e-antic.

The `arb` ticket has been closed but this branch doesn't upgrade `arb`. It includes a patch for the current shipped `arb` but it doesn't revbump the `arb` package which means that the patch is only applied to fresh builds and not to incremental upgrades.

At the minimum I think this branch needs to include a revbump for `arb`, but since we obsoleted the `arb` ticket I would favor upgrade `arb` in this ticket too.

As this ticket updates a dependency of arb, it will rebuild arb regardless of the presense of revbump (or at least it should - it it doesn't it's a bug in the build system)

I'm working on getting multi-variate polynomials running with the new flint code.

I expect to be opening a dependent ticket for that soon.

In the meantime, every time I type 'make build' on this branch (without any local mods), it rebuilds sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.  Every time.  Takes about 60 seconds, too.

Any ideas why it keeps rebuilding pbori?

`./configure` has `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option, which use would allow an automatic download from the url  in `checksums.ini`of the package.

> then a compile failure because it couldn't find "gmp.h", which I resolved with `apt install libgmp-dev`.


look at what `./configure` tries to tell at the end of its run - there should be a list of system packages to install to make one's life easier.
On Debian like 90% of Sage's (non-python) libs, as well as Python itself, etc etc, are unvendored, see #27330

I had to re-run configure after installing libgmp-dev, and I didn't keep the old log, but I don't remember any glaring complaints.  Furthermore, I found this in the (new) config.log:

   configure:37965: result: gmp-6.1.2:                                   using system package; SPKG will not be installed

I infer from this that a SPKG is available and should have been used by the original build.

I don't know enough about Sage packaging to know how a SPKG gmp should be used by flint.

How did you start the build?

I only can see this happening on an unconfigured tree if one does not start by
running `./configure`, but rather by doing something like `./sage -p flint` (which indeed does not check dependencies)

After `git checkout`, I ran `./bootstrap`, then `./configure`, then `MAKE="make -j8" make`.
