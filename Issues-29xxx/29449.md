As the summary says.

If I run "make numpy" on a system without its own pkg-config, the build fails. If I install Sage's `pkgconf` first, it works. `numpy` depends on `pkgconfig`, the Python interface to `pkgconf`, but `pkgconfig` really only makes sense if `pkgconf` (or a system-wide equivalent) is available.

Right. Because `pkgconfig` is a very small package, I don't think we need to distinguish its build-time and run-time dependencies. Adding the dependency there is clearer, even if right now only numpy exposes the problem.
