As the summary says.

If I run "make numpy" on a system without its own pkg-config, the build fails. If I install Sage's `pkgconf` first, it works. `numpy` depends on `pkgconfig`, the Python interface to `pkgconf`, but `pkgconfig` really only makes sense if `pkgconf` (or a system-wide equivalent) is available.
