The coercion framework never calls `_element_constructor_()` methods without optional or keyword arguments on an input that is already in the correct parent.  This ticket removes some unnecessary checks for this case.

I checked that (the branches of) the `if` statements removed by this ticket are never called by temporarily inserting `assert` statements.  In some other cases, I added doctests showing that the respective `if` statements cannot be removed (because the `_element_constructor_()` method has a optional or keyword arguments).

The deleted code in `multi_polynomial_libsingular` is no longer needed because these cases are handled by coercion maps from/via the base ring since #29247.

Maybe Travis, who knows better the coercion framework, could give his word ?

Yes, what is in the ticket description is correct (it is faster to do it there because it is Cython too). So +1 for doing this.
