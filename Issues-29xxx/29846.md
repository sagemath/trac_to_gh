... as a basis for a PEP 517 build system (#29845).

   - https://pypi.org/project/pytoml/ is not actively maintained, but replacing it with something else is being discussed at https://github.com/takluyver/flit/issues/255

   - https://pypi.org/project/flit-core/

   - https://pypi.org/project/flit/

`flit_core` installs itself using PEP 517, so this depends on the pip update in #29803; and we also have to fix `sage-pip-install`, which assumes a setuptools/distutils package.

tarballs: see checksums.ini
