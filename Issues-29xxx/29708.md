As noted in `build/make/deps` (and reported in #27824):

```
# TODO: If we reconfigure to build our own Python after having used the system
# Python, files installed to create the virtualenv should be *removed*.  That
# could either be done here by the makefile, or in an spkg-preinst for python3
```

In particular, the symlinks installed by venv together with the flawed copying from DESTDIR (see #29585) can cause the system python to be overwritten (observed on macOS).

#30687 solves this problem using an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script.

In this ticket, we develop a cleaner solution by setting up the venv into a script package `_venv`. Together with #29386 (Install script packages via `sage-spkg`), this will take care of uninstalling the symlinks before writing the python3 installation to `SAGE_LOCAL`.
