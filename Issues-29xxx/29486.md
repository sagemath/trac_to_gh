```
For package `rpy2` (versions 2.8.x) there is an unresolved build failure on cygwin when using system R (`cygwin-standard`).
This can be seen on the [GitHub](../wikis/GitHub) Actions workflow from #29403 but has also been reproduced locally. Details below.

This ticket disables use of system R on cygwin.  This should be reverted with the #29441 upgrade to more recent `rpy2` (python-3 only).

We can't use #29441 because the new version is py3 only. 
When we make the switch to py3-only sage, we can reconsider.

This leads to a policy question: does this failure on Cygwin mean that people on OS X, linux, etc., are deprived of having a Sage installation of R? (Does anyone download a Sage binary expecting to get a functioning installation of R?)

Actually, why should R be optional; shouldn't it just be rpy2?
