```
For package `rpy2` (versions 2.8.x) there is an unresolved build failure on cygwin when using system R (`cygwin-standard`).
This can be seen on the [GitHub](GitHub) Actions workflow from #29403 but has also been reproduced locally. Details below.

This ticket disables use of system R on cygwin.  This should be reverted with the #29441 upgrade to more recent `rpy2` (python-3 only).
