```
For package `rpy2` (versions 2.8.x) there is an unresolved build failure on cygwin when using system R (`cygwin-standard`).
This can be seen on the [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) Actions workflow from #29403 but has also been reproduced locally. Details below.

This ticket disables use of system R on cygwin.  This should be reverted with the #29441 upgrade to more recent `rpy2` (python-3 only).

Um, `sage.interfaces.r` IS the whole point of integration! We don't use it for other parts ourselves, but we make it available for users to use whatever is available through that interface. If it is optional, but binary distributions still include it, I am missing the point of what is standard. And for those who do use binary distributions it is not that easy to install optional packages.

I think dropping Python 2 support would be less noticeable than dropping R installation anywhere.

This should be checked. If it works with R from the sage spkg, then disabling use of the system package would be a 3rd option, probably the best one.
