```
Initializing the components of a vector field with a rational number as first component leads to an error:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: v = M.vector_field(1/2, -1)
...
IndexError: index n (=1) out of range; it must be 0
```
while providing the components as a list is OK:

```
sage: v = M.vector_field([1/2, -1])
sage: v.display()
1/2 d/dx - d/dy
```
This is due to `Rational` class having a `__getitem__()` method (for some reason...) and  `TensorField._init_components` (introduced in #27581) testing its input by 

```
    if hasattr(comp0, '__getitem__'):
```
Replacing the above line by 

```
    if hasattr(comp0, '__len__') and hasattr(comp0, '__getitem__'):
```
fixes the bug, since `Rational` has no `__len__` method.

```
    if isinstance(comp0, (list, tuple)):

failed if `comp0` is an object created by `vector(...)`, as revealed by a failed doctest in `vectorfield.py`. In the latest commit (comment:4), this is replaced by
