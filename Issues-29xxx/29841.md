Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron

This ticket improves obtaining the `CombinatorialPolyhedron` from an incidence matrix.

Along the way we also improve the method `CombinatorialPolyhedron.incidence_matrix` that reobtains the incidence matrix.

Note that #29837 greatly speeds up obtainment of incidence matrices in `Polyhedron_base`.
