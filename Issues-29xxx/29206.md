REPORTED BY: Ingo Dahn <ingodahn@gmail.com>

The following code prints in sage-9.0 blue lines instead of colored vectors (with tips). In sage-8.9 the presentation is correct:

```
v1=vector([1,2,3])
v2=vector([4,5,6])
p1=plot(v1)
p2=plot(v2,color='red')
p1+p2
```

When you say, "I had to choose", I assume you mean you implemented some of the code for this - can you point to some tickets or code where you think this might have shown up?  Maybe it's just as simple a problem as the move to threejs for plotting?  Thanks for any useful pointers.

William, the images you posted show which version of Sage was involved, but can you tell us whether you can see which "viewer" was involved?  (I can't remember when threejs became a default option for 3d viewing.)

What I don't understand is that

```
if plot_type == 'arrow':
    return line3d([start, [(u+v) for u,v in zip(coords, start)]], arrow_head=True, **kwds)
```
is in `sage/src/sage/modules/free_module_element.pyx`.  

Okay, the real problem is that `arrow_head` isn't implemented (apparently).  Try [this](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJzLycxLNU7RiI420AHCWB2FaI1S7TJNhbT8IoVSnTKFzDyFqswCjWhDHSMdQ5A0RJ1mLJCdWFSUXx6fkZqYYhtSVJqqU5aZWp5aZKteklGUmppVrK4JAAVMHMA=&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==):

```
line3d([[0,0,0], [(u+v) for u,v in zip([1,2,1], [0,0,0])]], arrow_head=True,viewer='threejs')
```

---

If someone can give me a pointer to where `line3d` for threejs is implemented (I haven't been actively developing in the plot code since about when threejs was fairly experimental) I can try to track this down exactly.
