This ticket is a successor to #27036.

The Virasoro central charge of a `FusionRing` is computed using the formula for WZW conformal field theories. This allows us to coerce the square root of the global quantum dimension into the cyclotomic field and normalize the S-matrix. So there are a lot of benfits.

Here is a temporary link to a build of the documentation:

<a id='comment:18'></a>I made some reviewer changes. Most of them are documentation and coding style, but two important things:

- Renamed `to_field` to `root_of_unity` as I feel this is more descriptive of what the method actually does.
- Implemented what appears to generically be a faster normalization of the `twist`:
  {{{
sage: E62 = FusionRing("E6", 2)
sage: %timeit [x.twist() for x in E62.basis()]
10000 loops, best of 5: 125 µs per loop
  }}}
  versus before
  {{{
10000 loops, best of 5: 128 µs per loop
  }}}
  I am getting these precise timings consistently, so the ~2% speedup is not just noise.

If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
