Let `K.<a> = NumberField(f)`. The method `K.is_galois()` does the following:

```
if self.degree() < 12:
    return self.galois_group(type='pari').order() == self.degree()
else:
    return len(self.automorphisms()) == self.degree()
```

The method `K.automorphisms()` [defined here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/31cb54b77951c888af513734ca36ac045fa9ca86/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py#L8329) runs essentially the PARI code

```
nfgaloisconj(nfinit(f))
```

to compute the automorphisms, followed by some conversions.
As [just discussed on pari-users](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-2001/msg00002.html), it is faster to run instead

```
nfgaloisconj(f)
```

because `nfinit` computes the full factorization of the discriminant of the polynomial, which is not (always) needed.

The question is whether the `nfinit(f)` data is really needed for the conversions in `K.automorphisms()`. If it is not needed, then the optimization (that is, calling `nfgaloisconj(f)` instead) can be implemented there. If it is needed, then the optimization can be implemented in `is_galois()`.

Either way, this would make `is_galois()` work faster for extensions of high degree.

The fact that it is currently slow was [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49620/is_galois-computation/), which led me to investigate.

Component: **number fields**

Keywords: **is_galois, automorphisms**
