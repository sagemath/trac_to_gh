which reveals ppl-dev - Parma Polyhedra Library (development binaries)
which might have what is needed in addition.

See https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ppl/blob/master/f/ppl.spec on how Fedora builds its ppl packages.

In particular: 

```
# In order to avoid multiarch conflicts when installed for multiple
# architectures (e.g., i386 and x86_64), we rename the header files
# of the ppl-devel package.  They are substituted with ad-hoc

# the architecture for which the compiler is compiling.
 
# Since our header files only depend on the sizeof things, we smash
# ix86 onto i386 and arm* onto arm.  For the SuperH RISC engine family,
# we smash sh3 and sh4 onto sh.
normalized_arch=%{_arch}
%ifarch %{ix86}
normalized_arch=i386

Regarding homebrew: this suggests using homebrew to install ppl, but Sage then doesn't allow that:

```
configure:27049: checking whether any of glpk gmp mpir is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:27053: result: yes; install ppl as well
configure:27448: no suitable system package found for SPKG ppl
```
And this is because Sage doesn't allow `glpk`: the file `build/pkgs/glpk/distros/homebrew.txt` says

```
## glpk 4.65 should not be used by Sage as long as it is not patched by Homebrew
# glpk
```
Is this because of the doctest failures which have been fixed at #29317? That is, can we use an unpatched `glpk`? Should I open up a ticket to allow homebrew's `glpk`?

We do use unpatched (to some extent) glpk on various Linux distos, I don't see why Homebrew is special in this sense. By the way, did you try submitting a Homebrew issue to fix this? I recently managed to talk them into fixing an annoying thing about their gettext package.

Nothing prevents you from installing glkp on Homebrew and using it regardless,
it's merely a hint that it's not printed (and thus not picked by the AI that does automated installs of Sage on Github Actions CI).

probably noone tested with `# optional - build` on, so it slipped through the cracks.
Obviously, a system package is not `"installed"` - in the sense, not by Sage.
The doctest has to be changed, to another package we don't have from a system (so this is a shrining list)...
