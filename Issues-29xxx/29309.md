A few comments:
- please document your methods
- use standard notation `n` instead of `V`.
- you can use `UINT32_MAX`
- `range(g.neighbors[v+1]-g.neighbors[v+1])` unless I'm mistaken, this range is empty...
- you can use `bitset_first` and `bitset_next` to iterate over 1s of a bitset. See for instance [https://github.com/sagemath/sagelib/blob/master/sage/misc/bitset.pxi](https://github.com/sagemath/sagelib/blob/master/sage/misc/bitset.pxi)
- `Diferent graph` -> `Different graph`, although I don't understand this comment.

Thank you so much for you input.

I have taken care of points 2, 3, 5 (I wasn't aware of the existence of a function like bitwise_next in O(1), thank you!).

Regarding the 6th point (sorry for the typo) the comment refers to the fact that the BFS should be done only on the SCC of the considered node with the inverted edges in order to obtain the backwards distance. Temporarily I had used the given graph because I was considering G as an undirected graph. The comment was only there to remind me to find and efficient way to perform the BFS on the desired graph.

About the 6th point as I commented before, the problem is that I have to consider the graph of reverse edges with vertices in the SCC. One way to do this is to create these graphs, however this seems be very inefficient. One solution I've though of is to create only the revere graph using init_revese, which is already implemented, and to run BFS adding only the vertices on the same SCC to the queue.

The current implementation of simple_BFS does not allow for this. However with a couple of very simple changes and adding an optional list of components to the arguments of the function it could. I am hesitant about this path because I would then have to fix all calls to this function.

Can I get your input on this one? Is it preferred not to mess with the arguments of already implemented functions? Perhaps I should just switch to another graph structure which allows for these operations although a bit less efficient?

I have been experimenting and it seems this method is more efficient when the graph is sparse.
It should happen because the method creates a short_digraph with the reverse edges, something that iFUB does not have to do.
