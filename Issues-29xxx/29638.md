This ticket changes the implementation of `FreeAbelianMonoidElement` to store its exponents as `mpz_t*` array (copied in part from `vector_integer_dense`). The file is cythonized for this. This makes multiplication much faster (from comment:10):

```
M = FreeAbelianMonoid('x', 5)
L = [M(list(v)) for d in (0..7) for v in IntegerVectors(d, 5)]
%timeit _ = [a * b for a in L for b in L]
1 loop, best of 5: 1.7 s per loop  -- (before)
1 loop, best of 5: 282 ms per loop  -- (after)
```

Another motivation for this change is to facilitate viewing free abelian monoids as the indexing set of polynomial rings.

Out of curiosity, is the slowdown with `timeit(..., repeat=5)` caused by deallocation?

By the way, I have also tried to use `vector_integer_sparse.mpz_vector` which is just a struct, but it is even slower (which is somewhat expected as the elements in the test case are not very sparse).

I think it is coming from the additional redirections and extra temporary objects (probably also the allocation as well).

> By the way, I have also tried to use `vector_integer_sparse.mpz_vector` which is just a struct, but it is even slower (which is somewhat expected as the elements in the test case are not very sparse).


There probably is a benefit from having both a sparse version if someone wants a free abelian monoid (or group) with say 10000 generators and utilize that sparseness. Although I would be a bit surprised if there was a good use case.

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')
sage: F._test_elements_eq_symmetric()
free(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

/home/math/mwagerin/git/sage_compute/src/bin/sage-python: line 2: 756763 Aborted                 (core dumped) sage -python "$@"
```

It can also be obtained like this:

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')
sage: any(F.an_element() == 0 for _ in range(10))
free(): invalid pointer
```

It seems to come from the call to `_Integer_from_mpz` in `_repr_`, but I cannot see anything wrong with it.

I also released there was no `_latex_`, so I quickly added that. There probably should be a common helper function for printing/latexing monomials with various options; I have definitely written a number of these methods in various places...

<a id='comment:21'></a>I have rebuilt Sage from scratch, but the problem persists. This is on Ubuntu 20.04.

It can also be reproduced with the `_repr_` directly (I have added sig_on/sig_off):

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')

    208             sig_off()

```

Here is a stack trace for the equality test, which shows that the `_repr_` is used in an error message:

<a id='comment:24'></a>Yes, the problem indeed exists with ZZ-vectors as well. The compiler gives the warning

```
[sagelib-9.2.beta3] warning: sage/rings/integer.pxd:41:37: Declarations should not be declared inline.

so I tried to remove the `inline` from the pxd file (this is the same format as used for `smallInteger` in that file), but it does not change the underlying problem.

However, the following change seems to fix the issue.
