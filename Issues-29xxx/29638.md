This ticket changes the implementation of `FreeAbelianMonoidElement` to store its exponents as `mpz_t*` array (copied in part from `vector_integer_dense`). The file is cythonized for this. This makes multiplication much faster (from[comment:10](#comment%3A10)):

```
M = FreeAbelianMonoid('x', 5)
L = [M(list(v)) for d in (0..7) for v in IntegerVectors(d, 5)]
%timeit _ = [a * b for a in L for b in L]
1 loop, best of 5: 1.7 s per loop  -- (before)
1 loop, best of 5: 282 ms per loop  -- (after)
```

Another motivation for this change is to facilitate viewing free abelian monoids as the indexing set of polynomial rings.

Sorry for not being able to get to this sooner. Here is a version unwrapping the dense integer vectors, with a fair amount of overlap with that implementation. Ideally we would refactor that out, but the lack of multiple inheritance in Cython makes that impossible.

On my machine:

1 loop, best of 5: 1.7 s per loop  -- Old

1 loop, best of 5: 282 ms per loop  -- With my branch

There is about a 10% slowdown:

```
sage: %timeit _ = [a * b for a in L for b in L]
1 loop, best of 5: 304 ms per loop  -- New branch
```

```
sage: timeit("_ = [a * b for a in L for b in L]", repeat=5)
5 loops, best of 5: 427 ms per loop  -- New branch

5 loops, best of 5: 384 ms per loop  -- Previous branch
```
So it depends on how much you want the extra speed. IMO, the amount of duplication is not significant enough compared to the extra speed. It is just unfortunate that we cannot work around the class hierarchy (and don't have multiple inheritance) to have a common ABC.

Of course, the next step after this would be doing the same treatment for free Abelian groups.

Thank you for trying this. I get similar timings on my machine. We should go with the previous branch then, I guess, but there are some errors when running the tests:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/monoids/free_abelian_monoid.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long src/sage/monoids/free_abelian_monoid_element.pyx  # Killed due to abort
```


Out of curiosity, is the slowdown with `timeit(..., repeat=5)` caused by deallocation?

By the way, I have also tried to use `vector_integer_sparse.mpz_vector` which is just a struct, but it is even slower (which is somewhat expected as the elements in the test case are not very sparse).

I think it is coming from the additional redirections and extra temporary objects (probably also the allocation as well).

> By the way, I have also tried to use `vector_integer_sparse.mpz_vector` which is just a struct, but it is even slower (which is somewhat expected as the elements in the test case are not very sparse).


There probably is a benefit from having both a sparse version if someone wants a free abelian monoid (or group) with say 10000 generators and utilize that sparseness. Although I would be a bit surprised if there was a good use case.

The problem can be reproduced like this, for example:

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')
sage: F._test_elements_eq_symmetric()
free(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/home/math/mwagerin/git/sage_compute/src/bin/sage-python: line 2: 756763 Aborted                 (core dumped) sage -python "$@"
```

It can also be obtained like this:

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')
sage: any(F.an_element() == 0 for _ in range(10))
free(): invalid pointer
```

It seems to come from the call to `_Integer_from_mpz` in `_repr_`, but I cannot see anything wrong with it.

I have rebuilt Sage from scratch, but the problem persists. This is on Ubuntu 20.04.

It can also be reproduced with the `_repr_` directly (I have added sig_on/sig_off):

```
sage: F = FreeAbelianMonoid(6,'b')
sage: [F.an_element()._repr_() for _ in range(30)]

    205         for i in range(self._n):

    208             sig_off()

RuntimeError: Aborted
```

Here is a stack trace for the equality test, which shows that the `_repr_` is used in an error message:

```

Yes, the problem indeed exists with ZZ-vectors as well. The compiler gives the warning

```
[sagelib-9.2.beta3] warning: sage/rings/integer.pxd:41:37: Declarations should not be declared inline.
```
so I tried to remove the `inline` from the pxd file (this is the same format as used for `smallInteger` in that file), but it does not change the underlying problem.

However, the following change seems to fix the issue.

This passes all the tests for me now, but I am still a bit confused about the issue – particularly because it occured with some randomness.

No – just with that branch. Maybe it is a Cython bug, but I do no think I will be able to debug this much further.

Thank you. I think we can move forward with this now, so I am setting this to positive.
