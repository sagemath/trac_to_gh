Currently, DiGraph constructor throws error for following type of incidence matrix.

```
sage: m=Matrix([[1,-1],[-1,1]])
sage: g=DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: each column represents an edge: -1 goes to 1
```


```
sage: m=Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1],[0,0]])
sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: there must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column
```

can i add following doctest for both #29275 and #29276:

```
TESTS:

Fix bug reported in :trac:`29275` and :trac:`29276`::

    sage: m = Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1]])
    sage: m
    [ 0  1]
    [ 0 -1]
    sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
    sage: list(G.edges(labels=False))
    [(1, 0)]
```

or shall I add separate doctest for this ticket?

No, I dont think #29276 is duplicate of #29275 both have completely different aim. #29275 is more of defect and #29276 is somewhat type of enhancement.
Although both have same branches performing same thing.
If you want, I can make `u/gh-vipul79321/ticket29275` specifically for #29275 by removing `if not NZ` part from code and corresponding doctest.

If that's the case then, It would be better to go with easiest solution for clean merging.
But I dont want to make doctest of ticket #29276 refer to ticket #29275. Can we keep it as it is?

If we keep only one ticket, we cannot refer the other ticket.
You can adjust the ticket description for instance like:
- title: `fix issues in the DiGraph constructor for incidence matrix`
- description: merge all issues.
