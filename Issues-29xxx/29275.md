Currently, DiGraph constructor throws error for following type of incidence matrix.

```
sage: m=Matrix([[1,-1],[-1,1]])
sage: g=DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: each column represents an edge: -1 goes to 1
```


```
sage: m=Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1],[0,0]])
sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: there must be two nonzero entries (-1 & 1) per column
```

can i add following doctest for both #29275 and #29276:

```
TESTS:

Fix bug reported in :trac:`29275` and :trac:`29276`::

    sage: m = Matrix([[0,1],[0,-1]])
    sage: m
    [ 0  1]
    [ 0 -1]
    sage: G = DiGraph(m,format='incidence_matrix')
    sage: list(G.edges(labels=False))
    [(1, 0)]
```

or shall I add separate doctest for this ticket?

> If #29276 is duplicate of this ticket, we can make all doctests refer to this ticket.

No, I dont think #29276 is duplicate of #29275 both have completely different aim. #29275 is more of defect and #29276 is somewhat type of enhancement.
Although both have same branches performing same thing.
If you want, I can make `u/gh-vipul79321/ticket29275` specifically for #29275 by removing `if not NZ` part from code and corresponding doctest.

You have to ensure that tickets are not touching the same part of the code, otherwise we may have merge conflicts.

One option is to do everything in this ticket (certainly the easiest solution), and the other is to ensure that tickets are completely independent. I let you decide.

But I dont want to make doctest of ticket #29276 refer to ticket #29275. Can we keep it as it is?

If we keep only one ticket, we cannot refer the other ticket.
You can adjust the ticket description for instance like:
- title: `fix issues in the DiGraph constructor for incidence matrix`
- description: merge all issues.
