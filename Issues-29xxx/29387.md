Follow up from #29082.

This ticket makes sure that **installed** pc files in `SAGE_LOCAL` are uninstalled correctly when the installation changes, via the staging/uninstalling mechanism extended to script packages by #29386.

- Code in `build/make/Makefile.in` is removed in favor of creating one or several new type=script packages, whose `spkg-install` does the installation to `SAGE_LOCAL`.
