We set up linear transformation with double description, if it preserves the polytope.

Also we slightly modify the affine hull projection to make use of this.

Before this ticket:

(Run tests twice to obtain the real timinigs. The first time it computes twice to populate the coercion model, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/UAvbXKSN_JU/vcVN2AVQBQAJ)

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 94.1 ms, sys: 2 µs, total: 94.1 ms
Wall time: 93.5 ms

sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 2.21 s, sys: 1 µs, total: 2.21 s
Wall time: 2.21 s

sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection(orthonormal=True, extend=True)
CPU times: user 1.36 s, sys: 2 µs, total: 1.36 s
Wall time: 1.36 s

sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(13)*Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]])
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 1.84 s, sys: 5 µs, total: 1.84 s
Wall time: 1.84 s
```

With this ticket on top of #29841 (this tickets new implementation uses `CombinatorialPolyhedron` which is much faster obtained with #29841):

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 78.9 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 78.9 ms
Wall time: 77.7 ms
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 1.23 s, sys: 35 µs, total: 1.23 s
Wall time: 1.23 s

sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
sage: P = P.base_extend(P.base_ring(), backend='field')
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 366 ms, sys: 3.98 ms, total: 370 ms
Wall time: 369 ms

sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(4) 
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection(orthonormal=True, extend=True)
CPU times: user 187 ms, sys: 10.8 ms, total: 198 ms
Wall time: 196 ms

sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(13)*Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]])
sage: %time Q = P.affine_hull_projection()
CPU times: user 847 ms, sys: 36 µs, total: 848 ms
Wall time: 846 ms
```
