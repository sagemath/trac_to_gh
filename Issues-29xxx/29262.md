I propose to implement a new algorithm for the unranking of combinations in the lexicographic order, cf. sage.combinat.combination algorithm from_rank.
The actual implementation is related to McCaffrey's blog.
In a recent paper I have written, cf. https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02462764v1
I compare this method to other from the literature and a new one I have developed with my co-authors. The paper is actually under review.

If possible I would like to commit this new implementation. My function has the same signature from the previous one.

Regards.
Antoine


Example :
Actual implementation (on my laptop : core i7 32GiB Ubuntu Linux)

```
sage: n = 100
sage: k = 50
sage: set_random_seed(12345678987654321)
sage: r = randint(0, binomial(n,k)-1)
sage: %time A = combination.from_rank(r,n,k)

CPU times: user 1.55 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.55 ms
Wall time: 1.06 ms

## With my algorithm
## (in the commit the function replace from_rank(.,.,.))

sage: %time B = unrank_combi_direct(r, n, k)   

CPU times: user 297 µs, sys: 53 µs, total: 350 µs
Wall time: 296 µs

## Finally

sage: A==B

True


## A second example with greater values

sage: n = 10000
sage: k = 5000
sage: set_random_seed(12345678987654321)
sage: r = randint(0, binomial(n,k)-1)
sage: %time A = combination.from_rank(r,n,k)

CPU times: user 2.9 s, sys: 9.69 ms, total: 2.91 s
Wall time: 2.85 s

## With my algorithm  (in the git branch I obviously reused the function name from_rank)

sage: %time B = unrank_combi_direct(r, n, k)

CPU times: user 22.4 ms, sys: 4.45 ms, total: 26.9 ms
Wall time: 21 ms

## Finally

sage: A==B

True
```

-if k < n/2:
+if k < n / 2:

-k = n-k
+k = n - k

-while d < k-1:

-if n-1-m==0:
+if n - 1 - m == 0:

-B = (B * (k-1-i))//(n-1-m)
+B = (B * (k-1-i)) // (n-1-m)

-D[k-1] = n+r+k-1-B
+D[k-1] = n + r + k - 1 - B
```
and these can be simplified:

```diff
-D = [0 for i in range(k)]
+D = [0]*k

-d = d + 1
+d += 1

-i = i + 1
+i += 1

-n = n - 1

-r = r - B
+r -= B

-m = m + 1
+m += 1

-j = j + 1
+j += 1

<a id='comment:13'></a>So here is the problem:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.combination import from_rank
sage: from_rank(0, 2, 1)
(1,)
sage: from_rank(1, 2, 1)
(2,)
```
instead this should be `(0,)` and `(1,)`. I haven't traced through the algorithm, but from testing, this seems to be just some special corner case (if indeed there is no bug in the implementation). It works on larger values of `n` and `k`.
