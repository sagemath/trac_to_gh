I propose to implement a new algorithm for the unranking of combinations in the lexicographic order, cf. sage.combinat.combination algorithm from_rank.
The actual implementation is related to McCaffrey's blog.
In a recent paper I have written, cf. https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02462764v1
I compare this method to other from the literature and a new one I have developed with my co-authors. The paper is actually under review.

If possible I would like to commit this new implementation. My function has the same signature from the previous one.

Regards.
Antoine


Example :
Actual implementation (on my laptop : core i7 32GiB Ubuntu Linux)

```
sage: n = 100
sage: k = 50
sage: set_random_seed(12345678987654321)
sage: r = randint(0, binomial(n,k)-1)
sage: %time A = combination.from_rank(r,n,k)

CPU times: user 1.55 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.55 ms
Wall time: 1.06 ms

## With my algorithm
## (in the commit the function replace from_rank(.,.,.))

sage: %time B = unrank_combi_direct(r, n, k)   

CPU times: user 297 µs, sys: 53 µs, total: 350 µs
Wall time: 296 µs

## Finally

sage: A==B

True


## A second example with greater values

sage: n = 10000
sage: k = 5000
sage: set_random_seed(12345678987654321)
sage: r = randint(0, binomial(n,k)-1)
sage: %time A = combination.from_rank(r,n,k)

CPU times: user 2.9 s, sys: 9.69 ms, total: 2.91 s
Wall time: 2.85 s

## With my algorithm  (in the git branch I obviously reused the function name from_rank)

sage: %time B = unrank_combi_direct(r, n, k)

CPU times: user 22.4 ms, sys: 4.45 ms, total: 26.9 ms
Wall time: 21 ms

## Finally

sage: A==B

True
```

This is quite a nice improvement. So it would be good to add `[DGH20]` to the master references file (as `[DGH2020]`) and then cite it as `[DGH20]_` (or with the changed name `[DGH2020]_`). Other than that, a few PEP8 space around operators:

```diff
-if k < n/2:
+if k < n / 2:

-k = n-k
+k = n - k

-while d < k-1:
+while d < k - 1:

-if n-1-m==0:
+if n - 1 - m == 0:

-B = (B * (k-1-i))//(n-1-m)
+B = (B * (k-1-i)) // (n-1-m)

-D[k-1] = n+r+k-1-B
+D[k-1] = n + r + k - 1 - B
```
and these can be simplified:

```diff
-D = [0 for i in range(k)]
+D = [0]*k

-d = d + 1
+d += 1

-i = i + 1
+i += 1

-n = n - 1
+n += 1

-r = r - B
+r -= B

-m = m + 1
+m += 1

-j = j + 1
+j += 1
```
Also would it be possible to keep the same variable names as before? While I doubt anyone is explicitly calling it with `n=foo`, it is still good in terms of being fully backwards compatible. Plus I feel it would be better to define `n0 = n` instead of the other way around.

So here is the problem:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.combination import from_rank
sage: from_rank(0, 2, 1)
(1,)
sage: from_rank(1, 2, 1)
