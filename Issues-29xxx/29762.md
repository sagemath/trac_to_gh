Ok, this looks good to me.

Is there a style recommendation behind this change? I do not mind the change, but I could see myself writing the else block in such a case, so I am just curious.

```diff
         if x == y:
             return False
-        else:
-            return self.is_lequal(x, y)
+        return self.is_lequal(x, y)
```

Danke schön !

Well, this is not a clear style recommandation. Pylint suggests that, but this depend very much on people tastes. Not something we want to force in any way.
