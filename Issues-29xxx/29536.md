1. Adjust directory names to something that works for both cases ...
   - `docker/Dockerfile` currently has:
      - `SAGE_ROOT=/home/sage/sage`
      - `SAGE_LOCAL=$SAGE_ROOT/local`
   - Docker images built with tox/GH Actions (including Gitpod) and also `computop/sage` have:
      - `SAGE_ROOT=/sage`
      - `SAGE_LOCAL=/sage/local`
   - **After this ticket:**
      - `SAGE_ROOT=/sage`
      - `SAGE_LOCAL=/opt/sage`
   - CoCalc Docker image has:
      - `SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage`
      - `SAGE_LOCAL=/usr/local/sage/local`

2. #33851: Define a script package representing "useful stuff to have on a Docker image" 

3. Replace all `apt-get` in `docker/Dockerfile` by using a Docker image built using `build/bin/write-dockerfile` as the base image.

4. By default, `docker/Dockerfile` would use `configure --without-system-...` a lot so that CI is done against "the reference distribution"


5. Move `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` into `docker/`

6. Add a mechanism (environment variable) to `tox -e docker...` to copy SAGE_LOCAL from a given Docker image.

Bikeshedding time! Let's pick `SAGE_ROOT`, `SAGE_LOCAL`. My proposal is in the ticket description. 

(The only important constraint for me is: Don't nest `SAGE_LOCAL` within `SAGE_ROOT` - for flexibility such as bind-mounting a new version of the source tree over `SAGE_ROOT` without hiding `SAGE_LOCAL`.)
