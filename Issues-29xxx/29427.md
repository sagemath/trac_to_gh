We make `build/make/Makefile` self-contained so that it no longer depends on environment variables set by `build/make/install`. 

We also break the log file scanning code (`1ook_for_errors`) in `build/make/install` out to a new helper script + make target.

See also: #29507 - Provide precious variables (`CFLAGS`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, ...) to `make`


Depends on #30622
