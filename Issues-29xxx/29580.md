What's the point of building gcc on MacOS? One cannot build Sage without Apple's or Conda's clang, anyway, as Apple polluted its system headers with blocks, which are not understood by unpatched gcc.

Do we know if this is still true with current gcc versions? It's not like macOS is some obscure platform.

Anyway, it's not important to fix for 9.1.
