We should take advantage of methods being able to now use `yield` in Cython and add a method to iterate over `(coefficient, exponent)` pairs as this can be useful (instead of monomials).

---

This also improves the iteration speed over multivariate polynomials:

```
sage: RR.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: pR = R.sum(x^i*y^j for i in range(100) for j in range(100))
sage: %timeit for _ in pR: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 5.75 ms per loop

sage: S.<x,y> = QQbar[]
sage: pS = S.sum(x^i*y^j for i in range(100) for j in range(100))
sage: %timeit for _ in pS: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 11.1 ms per loop

sage: L.<w,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: pL = L.sum(w^i*z^j for i in range(50) for j in range(50))
sage: %timeit for _ in pL: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 13 ms per loop
```
vs before:

```
sage: %timeit for _ in pR: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 6.42 ms per loop

sage: %timeit for _ in pS: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 11.3 ms per loop

sage: %timeit for _ in pL: pass
10 loops, best of 5: 81.8 ms per loop
```
There won't be really any improvement in the generic implementation in terms of speed. However, the memory usage for all of these methods has been cut.

---

This improves the speed of a number of auxiliary methods:

```
sage: %timeit pS.is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 258 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_monomial()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 286 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_generator()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 273 ns per loop
sage: %timeit S.zero().is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 326 ns per loop

sage: %timeit pL.is_monomial()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 307 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pL[5,5]
1000000 loops, best of 5: 611 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ~pL
100 loops, best of 5: 9.03 ms per loop

sage: M.<w,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: pM = M.sum(w^i*z^j for i in range(50) for j in range(50))
sage: %timeit hash(pM)
1000 loops, best of 5: 1.84 ms per loop
```
vs before

```
sage: %timeit pS.is_constant()
10000 loops, best of 5: 83.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_monomial()
10000 loops, best of 5: 81 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_generator()
10000 loops, best of 5: 82.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit S.zero().is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 1.41 µs per loop

sage: %timeit pL.is_monomial()
100000 loops, best of 5: 15.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pL[5,5]
100000 loops, best of 5: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ~pL
100 loops, best of 5: 9.46 ms per loop

sage: %timeit hash(pM)
100 loops, best of 5: 2.13 ms per loop
```

---

We add `is_term`, which was missing from libsingular multivariate polynomials. We also fix a bug that claims the 0 polynomial was a monomial:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: P.zero().is_monomial()
True
```

---

Another bug-fix is that exponents of generic MPolys were mutable and cached:

```
sage: pS.exponents().pop()
(0, 0)
sage: _ in pS.exponents()
False
```

I was actually expecting a bit more of a speedup from the libsingular iterator, but I guess that just goes to show the speed of the builtin Python iterators. However, it still gets about a ~10% speedup, which is nice, beyond the memory savings.
