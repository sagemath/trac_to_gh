We should take advantage of methods being able to now use `yield` in Cython and add a method to iterate over `(coefficient, exponent)` pairs as this can be useful (instead of monomials).

---

This also improves the iteration speed over multivariate polynomials:

```
sage: RR.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: pR = R.sum(x^i*y^j for i in range(100) for j in range(100))
sage: %timeit for _ in pR: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 5.75 ms per loop

sage: S.<x,y> = QQbar[]
sage: pS = S.sum(x^i*y^j for i in range(100) for j in range(100))
sage: %timeit for _ in pS: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 11.1 ms per loop

sage: L.<w,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: pL = L.sum(w^i*z^j for i in range(50) for j in range(50))
sage: %timeit for _ in pL: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 13 ms per loop
```
vs before:

```
sage: %timeit for _ in pR: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 6.42 ms per loop

sage: %timeit for _ in pS: pass
100 loops, best of 5: 11.3 ms per loop

sage: %timeit for _ in pL: pass
10 loops, best of 5: 81.8 ms per loop
```
There won't be really any improvement in the generic implementation in terms of speed. However, the memory usage for all of these methods has been cut.

---

This improves the speed of a number of auxiliary methods:

```
sage: %timeit pS.is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 258 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_monomial()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 286 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_generator()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 273 ns per loop
sage: %timeit S.zero().is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 326 ns per loop

sage: %timeit pL.is_monomial()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 307 ns per loop
sage: %timeit pL[5,5]
1000000 loops, best of 5: 611 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ~pL
100 loops, best of 5: 9.03 ms per loop

sage: M.<w,z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: pM = M.sum(w^i*z^j for i in range(50) for j in range(50))
sage: %timeit hash(pM)
1000 loops, best of 5: 1.84 ms per loop
```
vs before

```
sage: %timeit pS.is_constant()
10000 loops, best of 5: 83.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_monomial()
10000 loops, best of 5: 81 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pS.is_generator()
10000 loops, best of 5: 82.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit S.zero().is_constant()
1000000 loops, best of 5: 1.41 µs per loop

sage: %timeit pL.is_monomial()
100000 loops, best of 5: 15.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit pL[5,5]
100000 loops, best of 5: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ~pL
100 loops, best of 5: 9.46 ms per loop

sage: %timeit hash(pM)
100 loops, best of 5: 2.13 ms per loop
```

---

We add `is_term`, which was missing from libsingular multivariate polynomials. We also fix a bug that claims the 0 polynomial was a monomial:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: P.zero().is_monomial()
True
```

---

Another bug-fix is that exponents of generic MPolys were mutable and cached:

```
sage: pS.exponents().pop()
(0, 0)
sage: _ in pS.exponents()
False
```

Okay, I might have gone a bit overboard at the end. However, some of these little methods get some major speedups. There might be some other places to optimize. Definitely converting the generic multivariate polynomials to Cython will help and/or pushing more stuff to the polydict backend.

I was actually expecting a bit more of a speedup from the libsingular iterator, but I guess that just goes to show the speed of the builtin Python iterators. However, it still gets about a ~10% speedup, which is nice, beyond the memory savings.
