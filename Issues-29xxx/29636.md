We do have historical changelogs on the website, listing individual contributions of authors. http://www.sagemath.org/changelogs/index.html
I would think that it is sufficient.

Keeping this in the source tree can't be the right solution. 

In particular, if we keep the old spkg changelogs in the tree, then the contributions of newer contributors are not represented.
