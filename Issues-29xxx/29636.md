I agree that something needs to be done, but not this way - these changelogs may hold sentimental value for people involved (especially as Sage used to be developed using patches rather than commits to a VCS). 

How about moving these sections into separate files named
`old_changelog.txt` or something like this? (each of them may start with a notice like

```
Historical - check git logs for recent changes

We do have historical changelogs on the website, listing individual contributions of authors. http://www.sagemath.org/changelogs/index.html
I would think that it is sufficient.

Keeping this in the source tree can't be the right solution. 

In particular, if we keep the old spkg changelogs in the tree, then the contributions of newer contributors are not represented.
