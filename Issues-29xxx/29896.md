That's my instinct. We probably don't need both `make download-for-sdist` and `make download` in that case.

The branch "fixes" `make download` (and also cleans up `src/bin/` a bit more, on top of #30846 and similar earlier tickets).

I don't use this myself, so I don't know what is the best way to proceed regarding "standard" vs. "all" vs. "configured" packages. Perhaps they should be 3 different make targets.
