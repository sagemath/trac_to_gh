#27907 - "Building gcc 7.2.0 fails on CentOS / Red Hat / Fedora Linux systems because of crti.o" 
added code in `spkg-postinst` to copy `crti.o`.

`gfortran` needs the same - as observed on fedora-31-minimal (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/411500550) and fedora-32-minimal (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/411500596)

Tests with the fix are at:
https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/pull/1

Unrelated error: #29162 - gfortran compile error on debian-jessie
