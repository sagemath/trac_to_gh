But actually I think a better solution than `cython_aliases` needs to be found in the longer term. Installed .pxd headers should be made usable without a special environment.

I think the standard cython build tools allow you to do that manually if you want, but what's missing is a way to easily get e.g. all of the flags that sage itself used.
