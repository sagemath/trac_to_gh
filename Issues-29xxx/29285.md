The build fails when [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is present, as reported in  [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/-cGmntUHXqE/Pw02KLksCgAJ) and also in #32749/#33103.

We fix it by rejecting the pyenv shims for `sage-bootstrap-python`.

I do. Because I tried installing a standalone cygdb on Arch Linux for 3 days and only succeeded when I used pyenv, because I wanted two different python versions on my machine: A normal one and one compiled with --with-pydebug. Achieving this without pyenv is very hard (on Arch Linux).
>

If it is too hard or not possible to make sagemath work with pyenv that is ok. But there should be  a good error message, because no one looks at the message:

```
ImportError: /home/volker/.pyenv/versions/3.8.1-debug/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload/math.cpython-38d-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: PyFloat_Type
/tmp/tmppfahgne0:19: Error in sourced command file:
Error while executing Python code.
/home/volker/Sync/git/sage/src/bin/sage-gdb-commands:1: Error in sourced command file:
```
And thinks: "Ok, it looks like I need to uninstall pyenv." An error message similar to this:
"It looks like you installed pyenv. Sagemath is incompatible with pyenv. Please uninstall pyenv."
can save someone hours of work. If mkoeppe hadn't added me to the Cc, I would be going through the source code of sagemath right now to find the error. That would have costed me multiple days.

In General, I think it is really important that misconfigurations result in nice error messages.

Note: My issue can be found here: #29461

I was able to successfully install Sage using python 3.9 from pyenv (installed following

Perhaps one should check this on Homebrew, but it seems it's OK.

Test on macOS with `pyenv` from homebrew:

```
$ brew install pyenv
$ pyenv install 3.7.8
$ eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
$ echo $PATH

$ pyenv global 3.7.8
$ ./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url --with-python=python3
```
(`--with-python=python3` is needed here because otherwise we reject it as misconfigured - see [#32531 comment:3](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32531#comment:3))
