The build fails when [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is present, as reported in  [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/-cGmntUHXqE/Pw02KLksCgAJ) and also in #32749/#33103.

We fix it by rejecting the pyenv shims for `sage-bootstrap-python`.

I do. Because I tried installing a standalone cygdb on Arch Linux for 3 days and only succeeded when I used pyenv, because I wanted two different python versions on my machine: A normal one and one compiled with --with-pydebug. Achieving this without pyenv is very hard (on Arch Linux).
>

If it is too hard or not possible to make sagemath work with pyenv that is ok. But there should be  a good error message, because no one looks at the message:

```
ImportError: /home/volker/.pyenv/versions/3.8.1-debug/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload/math.cpython-38d-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: PyFloat_Type
/tmp/tmppfahgne0:19: Error in sourced command file:
Error while executing Python code.
/home/volker/Sync/git/sage/src/bin/sage-gdb-commands:1: Error in sourced command file:
```
And thinks: "Ok, it looks like I need to uninstall pyenv." An error message similar to this:
"It looks like you installed pyenv. Sagemath is incompatible with pyenv. Please uninstall pyenv."
can save someone hours of work. If mkoeppe hadn't added me to the Cc, I would be going through the source code of sagemath right now to find the error. That would have costed me multiple days.

In General, I think it is really important that misconfigurations result in nice error messages.

Note: My issue can be found here: #29461

I was able to successfully install Sage using python 3.9 from pyenv (installed following
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#basic-github-checkout) on Debian 10.

Perhaps one should check this on Homebrew, but it seems it's OK.

-we had seen at least one [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/-cGmntUHXqE/Pw02KLksCgAJ) where [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) broke the build, as pyenv'd Python prepends stuff like `/usr/bin` into `PATH`. 
+The build fails when [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is present, as reported in  [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/-cGmntUHXqE/Pw02KLksCgAJ) and also in #32749/#33103.
 
-It is documented in 
-https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#managing-virtual-environments
-that `pyenv` breaks everything regarding `venv`s. 
-
-It might be a good idea to check this at configure time.
+We fix it by rejecting the pyenv shims for `sage-bootstrap-python`.
