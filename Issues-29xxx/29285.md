The build fails when [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is present, as reported in  [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/-cGmntUHXqE/Pw02KLksCgAJ) and also in #32749/#33103.

We fix it by rejecting the pyenv shims for `sage-bootstrap-python`.

I do. Because I tried installing a standalone cygdb on Arch Linux for 3 days and only succeeded when I used pyenv, because I wanted two different python versions on my machine: A normal one and one compiled with --with-pydebug. Achieving this without pyenv is very hard (on Arch Linux).

If it is too hard or not possible to make sagemath work with pyenv that is ok. But there should be  a good error message, because no one looks at the message:

```
ImportError: /home/volker/.pyenv/versions/3.8.1-debug/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload/math.cpython-38d-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: PyFloat_Type
/tmp/tmppfahgne0:19: Error in sourced command file:
Error while executing Python code.
/home/volker/Sync/git/sage/src/bin/sage-gdb-commands:1: Error in sourced command file:
```
And thinks: "Ok, it looks like I need to uninstall pyenv." An error message similar to this:
"It looks like you installed pyenv. Sagemath is incompatible with pyenv. Please uninstall pyenv."
can save someone hours of work. If mkoeppe hadn't added me to the Cc, I would be going through the source code of sagemath right now to find the error. That would have costed me multiple days.

In General, I think it is really important that misconfigurations result in nice error messages.

Note: My issue can be found here: #29461

I was able to successfully install Sage using python 3.9 from pyenv (installed following

Perhaps one should check this on Homebrew, but it seems it's OK.

Test on macOS with `pyenv` from homebrew:

```
$ brew install pyenv
$ pyenv install 3.7.8
$ eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
$ echo $PATH
/Users/mkoeppe/.pyenv/shims:/Users/mkoeppe/miniconda3/condabin:/Users/mkoeppe/bin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/mkoeppe/google-cloud-sdk/bin:/Users/mkoeppe/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/opt/X11/bin
$ pyenv global 3.7.8
$ ./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url --with-python=python3
```
(`--with-python=python3` is needed here because otherwise we reject it as misconfigured - see #32531#comment:3)
