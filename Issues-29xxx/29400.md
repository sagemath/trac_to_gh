While doing some complex analysis, I encountered a bug when evaluating the cotangent function of a complex number when multiplied by a complex number.  When p and q are complex, real(p*cot(q)) or imag(p*cot(q)) produces a wrong result, while real(p/tan(q)) or imag(p/tan(q)) produces the correct result.

For example:

```

Additionally, when trying to numerically evaluate b with cotangent, it simply returns an error.  The numerical evaluation of a with tangent is returned without error.

I conducted this same test using both tangent and cotangent in Maxima.  They are both correct, and agree with the results involving tangent in Sage.  But for whatever reason in Sage, cotangent does not seem to work correctly when evaluating numerically or getting the real/imaginary part.

```

The numerator of y clearly has a sign error, so the formula being used to get the real part is incorrect when using cotangent.  The denominators are equivalent because cosh<sup>2</sup>(d)-1=sinh<sup>2</sup>(d).  A similar sign error is present when taking the imaginary part.

```
sage: x.imag().trig_reduce().simplify_full()

Thanks for pointing out the bugs, and for your further comments.

I think these are two different issues, so I have opened a new ticket (#29409) to discuss the `TypeError` caused by `b.n()`, which I think it is easy to fix. 

This ticket can focus on fixing the erroneous results that are described in the title. I have no idea what is wrong, but I did notice that there is no need for `a` and `b` in your example: the sign error already arises in the imaginary part of `cot(c + d*I)`.

```
sage: var('c d')
(c, d)
sage: assume(c,'real')
sage: assume(d,'real')
sage: cot(c + d*I).imag().trig_reduce().simplify_full()
cosh(d)*sinh(d)/(sin(c)^2 + sinh(d)^2)
sage: (1/tan(c + d*I)).imag().trig_reduce().simplify_full()
-cosh(d)*sinh(d)/(cosh(d)^2 + sin(c)^2 - 1)
```
There does not seem to be a sign error if we use a complex variable, instead of writing out `c + d*I`:

```
sage: var('z')
z
sage: cot(z*I).imag()
-cosh(real_part(z))*sinh(real_part(z))/(sin(imag_part(z))^2 + sinh(real_part(z))^2)
```

This is a sympy bug, so I reported it upstream ([#19366](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/19366)). The imaginary part of the `as_real_imag` method of sympy's cotangent class (`sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric.cot`) has the wrong sign.

```
1453      def as_real_imag(self, deep=True, **hints):
1454          re, im = self._as_real_imag(deep=deep, **hints)
1455          if im:
1456              denom = cos(2*re) - cosh(2*im)
1457 -            return (-sin(2*re)/denom, -sinh(2*im)/denom)
1457 +            return (-sin(2*re)/denom, sinh(2*im)/denom)
1458          else:
1459              return (self.func(re), S.Zero)

Testing in `CoCalc` shows that this was already fixed in 9.3 (presumably because Sympy was updated to 1.7 in #30985).

```
sage: a=(1+2*i)/tan(3+4*i)
sage: b=(1+2*i)*cot(3+4*i)
sage: a.real().n() - b.real().n()
4.44089209850063e-16
```
So we just need a doctest.

The PR just adds a doctest to verify that `cot(1 + i).imag().n()` is equal to `(1/tan(1 + i)).imag().n()` (modulo to an error tolerance of `10^-12`). It fails in 9.2:

```
sage: cot(1 + i).imag().n() - (1/tan(1 + i)).imag().n()
1.73602828579185
```
But it passes in 9.3:

```
sage: cot(1 + i).imag().n() - (1/tan(1 + i)).imag().n()
-1.11022302462516e-16
