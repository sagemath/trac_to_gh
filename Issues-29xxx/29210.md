As reported in [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/-zGb2Egxl-A), the `scipy.optimize.newton` became more picky about input and broke an interact.

The problem is reproducible below with sage-9.1.beta4

```
sage: f(t) = t**2 - 1/2
sage: df(t) = 2*t
sage: import scipy.optimize
sage: scipy.optimize.newton(f, 0.3, df)
Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-3a75ef95af3d> in <module>()
      2 __tmp__=var("t"); df = symbolic_expression(Integer(2)*t).function(t)
      3 import scipy.optimize
----> 4 scipy.optimize.newton(f, RealNumber('0.3'), df, maxiter=Integer(10))

/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/optimize/zeros.py in newton(func, x0, fprime, args, tol, maxiter, fprime2, x1, rtol, full_output, disp)
    297                     newton_step /= 1.0 - adj
    298             p = p0 - newton_step
--> 299             if np.isclose(p, p0, rtol=rtol, atol=tol):
    300                 return _results_select(
    301                     full_output, (p, funcalls, itr + 1, _ECONVERGED))

/opt/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/numeric.py in isclose(a, b, rtol, atol, equal_nan)
   2519     y = array(y, dtype=dt, copy=False, subok=True)
   2520 
-> 2521     xfin = isfinite(x)
   2522     yfin = isfinite(y)
   2523     if all(xfin) and all(yfin):

TypeError: ufunc 'isfinite' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''
```

The smartest way to achieve what is wanted is certainly

```
sage: f_fc = fast_callable(f, float)
sage: df_fc = fast_callable(df, float)
sage: scipy.optimize.newton(f_fc, 0.3r, df_fc)
0.7071067811865475
```
Should we just aknowledge the incompatibility or should we try something on the numpy side?
