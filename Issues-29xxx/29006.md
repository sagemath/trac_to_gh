As reported on [ask.sagemath.org https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49537/unable-to-convert-string-to-rational-when-plus-sign-is-added/], we have the following:

```
sage: ZZ('+3')
3
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R('+3')
3
```
but

```
sage: QQ('+3')
...
TypeError: unable to convert '+3' to a rational
```
I think this is because the `gmp` function `mpq_set_str` doesn't handle leading plus signs, but I'm not sure. In any case, should Sage handle this better?

Your diagnosis is correct. The function `mpq_set_str` inherits this behavior from `mpz_set_str`. 

I don't think it is a good idea for sagemath to go around telling people that it doesn't know how to turn `'+3'` and `'+3/2'` into rational numbers, so I wrote a (very easy) pull request to fix this. It patches `mpz_set_str`, which is the most direct solution, but I don't know whether there are practical considerations that make this undesirable. 

I think the other obvious solution would be to preprocess the input to `mpq_set_str`, but that seems to me to be both inelegant and inefficient.

(Should the patch be sent upstream to mpir for their consideration? Perhaps it should go even farther upstream to gmp, but I don't know how to use mercurial. I'm not even very confident with git yet. I don't know how likely it is that either of these projects would accept the patch, since it's changing the behavior and not fixing a bug.)

This will only fix the problem for users who use Sage's `mpir`. I see this in `config.log`:

```
configure:22728: result:     mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```
so patching `mpir` won't be any help.

Submitting a patch to `mpir` would be a good idea, and if it's accepted, it will make its way to Sage, and also to various linux distributions, homebrew, etc. I guess [this](https://github.com/wbhart/mpir) is the spot. I think there is a good chance they will accept the patch, and one of the main authors (Bill Hart) has been active in Sage development. So you can point to this ticket and it will have some resonance.
