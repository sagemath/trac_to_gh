As reported on [ask.sagemath.org https://ask.sagemath.org/question/49537/unable-to-convert-string-to-rational-when-plus-sign-is-added/], we have the following:

```
sage: ZZ('+3')
3
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R('+3')
3
```
but

```
sage: QQ('+3')
...
TypeError: unable to convert '+3' to a rational
```
I think this is because the `gmp` function `mpq_set_str` doesn't handle leading plus signs, but I'm not sure. In any case, should Sage handle this better?

<a id='comment:4'></a>This will only fix the problem for users who use Sage's `mpir`. I see this in `config.log`:

```
configure:22728: result:     mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```
so patching `mpir` won't be any help.

Submitting a patch to `mpir` would be a good idea, and if it's accepted, it will make its way to Sage, and also to various linux distributions, homebrew, etc. I guess [this](https://github.com/wbhart/mpir) is the spot. I think there is a good chance they will accept the patch, and one of the main authors (Bill Hart) has been active in Sage development.
