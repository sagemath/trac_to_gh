Currently, this method has almost no documentation.

Also it relies on `polar` to work differently for `Polyhedron_ZZ` than for `Polyhedron_base`. However, this is not being tested at all. We fix this by checking being reflexive just from the inequalities.

This also improves the error messages. We raise a `ValueError` if the polyhedron is unbounded. If the polytope does not have the origin in the interior, we return `False`, as this is clearly not reflexive.

Even though the raised error is not wrong as written (that it is not a polytope), I would still say "the polyhedron is not compact" or "the polyhedron should be compact". Simply because this avoids an eventual confusion in nomenclature polytope vs polyhedron.

Those two statements are not equivalent. I would say that a polytope without origin in interior is not reflexive and that the return value shall be `False` (and no error message). However, in this case the polar is not defined. This is why I chose this specific formulation.

Then, one should be transparent. Why not something like:

```diff
+       A lattice polytope is reflexive if it contains the origin and its polar with respect to the origin is a lattice polytope.

<a id='comment:8'></a>One last things:

```diff
- "the polyhedron should be compact"

```

sounds better to me. A "should" gives it too many ways to be interpreted, whereas a "is not" is only reporting a fact, which I prefer. Not a big thing...

Patchbots look okay to me. So you can put this on positive review once you make this change on my behalf.
