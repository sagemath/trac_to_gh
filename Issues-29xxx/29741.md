A few little things to fix up.

Instead of `'` in the docstring, you should use ```.

Your `toggle` function is over-indented.

I am a little worried about the assignment `result[r] = ...`. It works, but it could change if the internal workings of the GT patterns change (it is also a little too mutable IMO). I think it would be better to do it more explicitly:

```python
r = n - i
P = self.parent()
data = [list(row) for row in self]
data[r] = [toggle(r,s) for s in range(i)]
return P.element_class(P, data)
```
