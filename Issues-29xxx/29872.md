As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/d8dVrQai_x8/S1NvsZCDAAAJ and https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/1AXipTx8HPA/m/dBawYmzWBwAJ

This can be worked around by the user by just adding `/usr/local` explicitly, for example by sourcing `.homebrew-build-env` (which is already recommended by `./configure`), but we should add a fix.

The reason for this is the `-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk` that comes in from the system Python's compiler configuration (after #29404). This is correct for pynac.  

As we already determine the location of GMP in `build/pkgs/spkg-configure.m4`, we should pass it to pynac's `configure`.



Depends on #32386

```
CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -I/usr/local/include" CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L/usr/local/lib" make pynac

Looking back, I can see the suggestion.  The way it's phrased I thought it was optional.

"Homebrew can issue suggestions regarding keg-only packages.  The following command is to automatically apply these suggestions for packages relevant for Sage to make them available for the build.  Run it once to apply the suggestions for the current session."

So I just did `brew install ...` and then `./config.status --recheck && ./config.status`.
