This ticket adds an `spkg-configure.m4` for linbox, in order to use it from a system package if possible (see #27330).

Note for packagers: by default, linbox produces a buggy `linbox.pc`, and ``@`LINBOXSAGE_LIBS`@`` must be removed from their `linbox.pc.in` (see #27205).

No more problem after that.

Hmm, looking at the spkg-install for linbox, we already pass `--without-fplll`:

```
# Disable fplll as version 5.x is not supported by linbox <= 1.5.0.
# This is harmless as no functionality using fplll is exposed in Sage.
# See trac ticket #21221.
LINBOX_CONFIGURE="--without-fplll $LINBOX_CONFIGURE"
```

So, the existing dependency on fplll (in `build/pkgs/linbox/dependencies`) is wrong. I'm going to build a system copy of linbox with all of the other stuff disabled and see what goes wrong. Maybe we don't care if the other stuff is enabled, either.

This page has some information on how to checkout and push new branches to our trac server:

  http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html

You should be able to checkout my branch, add a commit on top of it, and then push a new branch of your own (which you would then stick in the "branch" field of this ticket). That's the best way to collaborate since it will keep your commit info and author information in-tact. If you don't feel like dealing with it, though, I can just add the spkg-configure.m4 onto my branch and re-push.

After adding flint to the DEPCHECK, I think only two questions remains:

* Do we need to check for flint support in the spkg-configure check? Given that flint support is "automagically" enabled, I don't think it's necessary on source-based distros, who should have flint support enabled unconditionally to avoid problems. If none of the binary distros ship a flint-less linbox, then we can skip it.
* Should we try to set the version bound to 1.5.2? Someone would need to test that.

Note that the purpose of the `SPKG_DEPCHECK` logic is as follows: The system package MIGHT link to an optional dependency like `fplll`. Therefore, if we build our own `fplll`, we need to avoid using system `linbox`.

It does not help at all to remove features from our build of the `linbox` spkg.

Ideally we would detect that optional linkage using `AC_SEARCH_LIBS`, so that we only reject a system linbox if it actually links to something on the system that is also installed (and linked into sage) as an SPKG. But `DEPCHECK` is much easier than digging through the source looking for public functions hidden behind e.g. `HAVE_IML`, so I've just gone ahead and used `DEPCHECK` for now.

Not having those features in the SPKG means that we don't have to insist that they be present in the system copy.

You want the linbox SPKG to have mpfr, ntl, and iml support... but also accept a system linbox that doesn't? And will crash the moment anyone tries to use those optional features?

A user can write his own code that depends on his own special system copy of linbox, but he won't get it committed to sage, which is the risk we run retaining the optional features in the SPKG. And the general trend is from-SPKG-to-system-package -- not the other way around -- minimizing the risk that someone will shoot himself in the foot that way. Finally, we're not doing "two wrong make a right." Avoiding the one potential problem is a win. Sage doesn't need those features enabled.

LGTM. The linbox team doesn't really do maintenance releases, so even if we set the bound to `< 1.7.0`, it would have the same effect. `sage_spkg_install_linbox=no` is the default so it's not really necessary but it won't hurt anything.
