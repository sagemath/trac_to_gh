Currently, the face generator of polyhedra is a wrapper of the `FaceIterator` class, which is intended for combinatorial polyhedra.

However, it takes only little effort to modify this to return a `PolyhedronFace` instead of a `CombinatorialFace` on `next`. The class `FaceIterator` has the advantage that it exposes extra features of `FaceIterator`. Currently, there is only the possibility of ignoring sub- or supfaces, but there might be more features added later.

It also simplifies it a lot for the user to obtain a `PolyhedronFace` from `FaceIterator` as the needed function is not exactly easy to find.

Follow up:
- Use `FaceIterator` to obtain the meet of (some) vertices or the join of (some) facets.

This is motivated by https://ask.sagemath.org/question/34485/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-look-up-a-face-in-the-face-lattice-of-a-polyhedron/#50965
