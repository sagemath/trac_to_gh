There are others, but I don't think they come from the Sage library:

Those are funny. I see them in vanilla sage but not in sage-on-gentoo. It would be nice to figure them out one day. All I could see under `repl` was already properly made into a raw string.

If you don't have any more clue about it I guess we should already go with the one that are fixed here.

I think they come from IPython, so upgrading that should help: [#28550 comment:2](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/28550#comment:2)
