There are others, but I don't think they come from the Sage library:

```
[repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
```
Is this ready for review? If so, feel free to give it a positive review from me.

Those are funny. I see them in vanilla sage but not in sage-on-gentoo. It would be nice to figure them out one day. All I could see under `repl` was already properly made into a raw string.

If you don't have any more clue about it I guess we should already go with the one that are fixed here.
