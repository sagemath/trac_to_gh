This ticket collects several issues related to the division operation of matrices.

• #29257 `__truediv__` does not work for matrices of different dimensions:

  ```
  sage: set_random_seed(1)
  sage: B, A = matrix.random(QQ, 2, 4), matrix.random(QQ, 4, 4)
  sage: B * ~A;    # works
  sage: B / A      # fails
  ...
  TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for /: 'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 4 dense matrices over Rational Field' an
  d 'Full MatrixSpace of 4 by 4 dense matrices over Rational Field'
  ```
  The corresponding `_backslash_` operation usually works.

• #29257 For two square matrices, the default `__truediv__` implementation `left * ~right` computes the inverse of a matrix. This is unsuitable for numerical computations at least. A better implementation would invoke `solve_left` for matrices and vectors (`_backslash_` already calls `solve_right`).

• #12406 `solve_left` and `solve_right` should use coercion to find compatible parents

• #12406 `solve_right` and `solve_left` over `RDF`/`CDF` only work for square matrices, even though generic matrices support non-square matrices:

  ```
  sage: set_random_seed(0)
  sage: A, B = matrix.random(QQ, 4, 3), matrix.random(QQ, 4, 2)
  sage: A.solve_right(B);                                   # works
  sage: A.change_ring(RDF).solve_right(B.change_ring(RDF))  # fails
  ...
  NotImplementedError: coefficient matrix of a system over RDF/CDF must be square, not 4 x 3
  ```
  This could be solved by using `scipy.linalg.lstsq` to find a least-squares solution.

• #17405 `solve_right` and `solve_left` over `RDF`/`CDF` fail with matrix right hand side

• #13932 `solve_right` and `solve_left` fail with floating point matrices (due to exact checking of the solution)

• #28586 `solve_right` and `solve_left` fail for `matrix_modn_sparse`

• #29729 improve checking the result of `solve_right` for some inexact rings

What is a good solution for the first problem? Should there be inverse left/right actions of matrix multiplication, so that the coercion framework can be used to find these actions?

The implementation of `__truediv__` needs to be overwritten for matrices in any case in order to make use of `solve_left`. However, `solve_left` itself also needs to use some form of coercion to make sure the parents of the arguments are compatible (in #17405, I implemented this in an ad-hoc way which could be copied). I am not sure whether implementing inverse actions would help with this or make things needlessly complicated.

Well, the division operator for matrices has existed in Sage for years, so removing it at this point would be quite unfortunate. In #29257, I am just trying to improve the implementation of this matrix operator, to make it as good as it can be.

Let me explain why this operator is important for matrices. Here is an example of an actual computation I did a few days ago

```
S \ U.H * A * U / S
```
where `U,S,A` are matrices. In Sage, this currently only works if `U` is square, which is unnecessarily restrictive, so you are forced to write

```
~S * U.H * A * U * ~S
```
This comes with its own problems because it is slower and numerically less accurate due to the inversion of a matrix. A better way to compute this would be

```
S.solve_left(S.solve_right(U.H) * A * U)
```
Writing it like this is rather backwards and difficult to remember. After #29257, this will be equivalent to the first example, which is a much easier syntax as the binary operators compose nicely.

The slash and backslash operators are very standard notation in Matlab, so many people will be familiar with it. After all, it is Sage's mission to be a viable alternative to Matlab among others. Considering all our work on #12406 to improve the backslash operator, I am a bit surprised by your concerns about the forward slash operator. I have difficulties to see how this is doing the wrong thing 100% of the time.

As for the numerical issues, here is an example from the [Matlab documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/inv.html#bu6sfy8-1) that shows that using the slash operator to solve `A*x = b` is typically faster and more accurate than computing the matrix inverse:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: n = 500
sage: Q = matrix.random(RDF, n).QR()[0]
sage: d = numpy.logspace(0, -10, n)
sage: x = matrix.random(RDF, n, 1)
sage: A = Q * matrix.diagonal(CDF, d) * Q.H
sage: b = A * x
sage: y = ~A * b          # first solution
sage: z = A \ b           # second solution

sage: %timeit y = ~A * b  # slower
10 loops, best of 5: 29.6 ms per loop

sage: %timeit z = A \ b   # faster
100 loops, best of 5: 13.7 ms per loop

sage: (A * y - b).norm()  # large error
1.2981997570563244e-07

sage: (A * z - b).norm()  # small error
1.7440675515723775e-15

It's also very possible that everyone else just plain disagrees with me, and that's fine too. I'm just throwing in my two cents: it's easier for me to write big programs if the compiler keeps me from doing things I don't mean to do. And for me, dividing by a matrix is something I never mean to do.
