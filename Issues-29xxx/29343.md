Currently, `pari_nftables/spkg-configure.m4`
does not check at all for a system package;
but one is provided on Fedora and other distributions.

Here we implement the check,assuming that `nftables` is installed in `default(datadir)` - that's where all the other pari/GP packages are usually installed (and that's where distros put it).

From the [pari packages page](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html):

Karim Belabas tells me that

> nftables is not used by 'gp' (it is just an external table,
> also available via LMFDB), there is no reasonable way to test
> whether it is installed from the binary.

>
> For the package 'nflistdata', we can do something like

>
> {{{
> iferr(!!nflist("A5"), E, 0, errname(E) == "e_PACKAGE");
> }}}
