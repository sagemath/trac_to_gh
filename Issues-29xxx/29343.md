Currently, `pari_nftables/spkg-configure.m4`
does not check at all for a system package;
but one is provided on Fedora and other distributions.

Here we implement the check,assuming that `nftables` is installed in `default(datadir)` - that's where all the other pari/GP packages are usually installed (and that's where distros put it).

From the [pari packages page](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html):

> This package requires no installation:
> extract it where desired and look at the
> [README](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/pub/pari/packages/nftables/README.txt).

Karim Belabas tells me that

> nftables is not used by 'gp' (it is just an external table,
> also available via LMFDB), there is no reasonable way to test
> whether it is installed from the binary.

>
> For the package 'nflistdata', we can do something like

> iferr(!!nflist("A5"), E, 0, errname(E) == "e_PACKAGE");

This works:

```
$ gp -q
? default(parisize, 100000000);                                                                         
? v=readvec("/usr/share/pari/nftables/T31.gp")
%3 = [[-23, [1, -1, 0, 1], 1, []], ...
```

This is of course far from ideal, as the absolute path should be replaced by something known to `gp`. Also, `T31` is too big for the default stack size of 7Mb, it's better to use smaller `T71`. E.g., assuming that `nftables` is installed in Pari-GP `datadir`, one can do instead

```
$ gp -q
? v=readvec(concat([default(datadir), "/nftables/T71.gp"]));
```

This call returns nothing if `T71` is there, and otherwise it produces an error and gives `break>` prompt.
