Currently, `pari_nftables/spkg-configure.m4`
does not check at all for a system package;
but one is provided on Fedora and other distributions.

Here we implement the check,assuming that `nftables` is installed in `default(datadir)` - that's where all the other pari/GP packages are usually installed (and that's where distros put it).

From the [pari packages page](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/packages.html):

Karim Belabas tells me that

> nftables is not used by 'gp' (it is just an external table,

%3 = [[-23, [1, -1, 0, 1], 1, []], ...
```

This is of course far from ideal, as the absolute path should be replaced by something known to `gp`. Also, `T31` is too big for the default stack size of 7Mb, it's better to use smaller `T71`. E.g., assuming that `nftables` is installed in Pari-GP `datadir`, one can do instead

```
$ gp -q
? v=readvec(concat([default(datadir), "/nftables/T71.gp"]));
```

This call returns nothing if `T71` is there, and otherwise it produces an error and gives `break>` prompt.
