This ticket fixes the `Tokenizer` in `sage.misc.parser` to handle unicode strings.

For example, this fixes these issues:

```
sage: SR('位 + 2位')
...
SyntaxError: Malformed expression
...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xce in position 0: unexpected end of data

sage: QQ['位']('位^2')
...
SyntaxError: Malformed expression
```

This is solved by changing the tokenizer to work with Python strings instead of C-strings. This is also what Cython [recommends to do](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html#general-notes-about-c-strings). The C-strings were only used internally in the tokenizer, so this change should be unproblematic.

Note that this is strictly about tokenizing/parsing of expressions, but not about validating input, even though some interfaces (like Maxima) might not support unicode. It is already possible to construct these expressions by different means, so the parser should support that as well.

Do you want to make `s` known as a `str` object in the preparser?

Also, you don't need to mark the tests a `# py3` since we are Python3 only now.
