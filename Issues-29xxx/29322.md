There are many spkgs whose testsuites fail.

`sage-spkg` uses the following defaults:

```
# Since Python's self-tests seem to fail on all platforms, we disable
# its test suite by default.
if [ -z "$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES" ]; then
    SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'
fi
```

More should be added to adjust for expected failures.

- `pathpy` -- `spkg-check` picks up top-level `tox.ini` and gets confused

See also:  
- #29301 - `sage-spkg`: Add an option `-w` for warning only if `spkg-check` fails
- #22866 - Cygwin spkg-check meta-ticket
- #28998 - Add script-type _spkg_check package that installs tox, mock, pytest etc.
- #29087 - Add [GitHub](GitHub) Actions workflow ... 
     has comments in `tox.ini` on skipping some testsuites
- #30093 - skip test suite for curl, git
