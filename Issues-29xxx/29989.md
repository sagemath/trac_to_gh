The doctests of the PSage interface sometimes fail when the garbage collector runs. This ticket fixes that.

Is it acceptable, when the garbage collector runs in those cases?

I don't know much of the history of sage, but this code is back from 2006 and maybe too old to care about stable doctest. So it might be fine to delete those `print` messages (looks to me like they where changed only to make them work with python3).

Yes, once an object falls out of use, it should be fine to garbage collect it. It is not possible (nor needed) to control when this happens. During the doctest run of that file, multiple instances of `PSage` are created, so they quickly fall out of use.

The `print` messages look to me like a remnant from developing that code – they are not at all informative – so probably this just has not been changed because this is rarely used. A plain `print` should never be used for something like this.

Since recently, this issue frequently occurs on the patchbots.
