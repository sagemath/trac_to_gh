This ticket adds some code based on the tiling solver class and dancing links solver to find a surrounding of a polyomino with copies of itself. An example is below:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino
sage: H = Polyomino([(-1, 1), (-1, 4), (-1, 7), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2),
....: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 1), (1, 2),
....: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 2),
....: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)])
sage: H.show2d()
```

![](H.png)

```
sage: %time solution = H.self_surrounding(10, ncpus=8)
CPU times: user 1.69 s, sys: 1.08 s, total: 2.77 s
Wall time: 3.85 s
sage: G = sum([p.show2d() for p in solution], Graphics())
sage: G
```

I don't like the fact that this raises a general `Exception`. I think it should be more specific like a `ValueError`.

Some of these are PEP8 and could amount to more of bikeshedding, but I think it is good to try and follow them. There are a few other such PEP8 code changes that could be done too beyond those I mentioned here.

J'ai trouvé le double statement sur une même ligne. Je l'ai mis sur deux lignes séparées.

J'ai fait un rebase sur une version plus récente de Sage que j'utilise sur cette machine (9.1.rc1).

Needs review.
