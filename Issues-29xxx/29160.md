This ticket adds some code based on the tiling solver class and dancing links solver to find a surrounding of a polyomino with copies of itself. An example is below:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.tiling import Polyomino
sage: H = Polyomino([(-1, 1), (-1, 4), (-1, 7), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2),
....: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 1), (1, 2),
....: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 2),
....: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)])
sage: H.show2d()
```

![](H.png)

```
sage: %time solution = H.self_surrounding(10, ncpus=8)
CPU times: user 1.69 s, sys: 1.08 s, total: 2.77 s
Wall time: 3.85 s
sage: G = sum([p.show2d() for p in solution], Graphics())
sage: G
```

I don't like the fact that this raises a general `Exception`. I think it should be more specific like a `ValueError`.

Some of these are PEP8 and could amount to more of bikeshedding, but I think it is good to try and follow them. There are a few other such PEP8 code changes that could be done too beyond those I mentioned here.

<a id='comment:13'></a>J'ai trouvé le double statement sur une même ligne. Je l'ai mis sur deux lignes séparées.

Needs review.
