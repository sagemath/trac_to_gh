at present ECL installation takes the headers of libffi from whereever it can, and first of all from "standard" locations. Thus an imcompatible libffi headers (and version 3.3 introduced an apparent incompatibility)  installed system-wide break building of ECL even though `--without-system-ecl` is given.

This was reported to happen on Debian testing.
(And an earlier related ticket is #21811). The initial debugging started on this [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/eVvjvJ6Iii8/_AMWpclTFAAJ) of sage-devel. 

ECL's configure has an option `--with-libffi-prefix=path` which hopefully does the job (untested); if so, this would at least allow
the build to succeed in such a configuration.

Another task is to test for the incompatible libffi (well, we can just test the version not to be above 3.2.x for some x).

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
In upstream ECL it's addressed in https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/302

So we hopefully can backport this to out 16.1.2, and support all versions of libffi, old and current.
