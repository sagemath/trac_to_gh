Minor points for PEP8:

```diff
-delta = d-e
+delta = d - e
```

```diff
-                            a = a/2
-                            c = c**2/y
+                            a /= 2
+                            c = c**2 / y
                             if n >= a:
-                                c = c*x/y
+                                c = c * x / y
                                 n = n - a
-                        C = c*S[0]/y
                 else:
-                    C = B.leading_coefficient()**(delta-1) * B / s**(delta-1)
                 S = [ring(C)] + S
             else:
                 C = B
             if e == 0:
                 return S
-            B = A.pseudo_quo_rem(-B)[1]/(s**delta*A.leading_coefficient())
+            B = A.pseudo_quo_rem(-B)[1] / (s**delta * A.leading_coefficient())
```
Also could you remove a few of the blanklines after the `subresultants` before `composed_op` just to make it a bit more standardized?

Once these are done/ignored, you can set a positive review.

No, that isn't the problem (this is done in many places in Sage, plus I like the space to differentiate it from other output and to match what Sage does). Actually it comes from:

```
multi_polynomial_element.subresultants
```
missing an `EXAMPLES::`.

Also, one other trivial change in 2 files:

```diff
-subresultants(self, other, variable= None):
+subresultants(self, other, variable=None):
```
