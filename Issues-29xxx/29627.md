(from #29626)

With a fresh tarball, `sage --pip install PKG` doesn't do what I want: since I'm using the system Python, it installs the package in the system location, not in SAGE_ROOT/local/..

(It gives an error for a bootstrapped, unconfigured tree, but calls system python in a configured tree.)

In this ticket, we change all of `sage -pip`, `sage -python`, `sage -python3` etc. to give an error if Sage's Python has not been built yet (or the venv over the system python3 set up).

`sage -pip` just calls `sage-python -m pip`.

In fact, `sage -python` should probably exit with an error if the venv (or Sage's python) has not been created yet.
