We set up the product of two polyhedra with both Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation. This a great improvement, if the backend supports precomputed data (currently `field`). Otherwise, it can be an improvement, if the Hrepresentation is much shorter than the Vrepresentation.

Wall time: 2.59 s
sage: %time _ = Cr*Cr

Wall time: 99.6 ms

sage: Cr_field = polytopes.cross_polytope(4, backend='field')
sage: Cb_field = polytopes.hypercube(4, backend='field')
sage: %time _ = Cb_field*Cr_field

Some timings in the description are repeated, probably you forgot "Cr*Cb" in the status quo and didn't show it in the new times...

If you can fix this quickly, that'd be helpful!

Spaces between binary operation:

```diff
-           sage: P*P1 == Q*Q1
+           sage: P * P1 == Q * Q1
+           True
-           sage: P.polar(in_affine_span=True)*P1 == Q.polar(in_affine_span=True)*Q1
+           sage: P.polar(in_affine_span=True) * P1 == Q.polar(in_affine_span=True) * Q1
+           True
```

and

```diff
-        new_vertices = (tuple(x)+tuple(y)
+        new_vertices = (tuple(x) + tuple(y)
+                        for x in self.vertex_generator() for y in other.vertex_generator())
```

Might be nice to correct the coding styles with the multiple statements on one line with the `:` ?

@vbraun: I believe this is no longer an issue.
