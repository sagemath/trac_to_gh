```
In Sage 9.1.beta0, we have 

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: M.set_calculus_method('sympy')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: X.calculus_method()
Available calculus methods (* = current):
 - SR (default) (*)
 - sympy
```
while the current calculus method on the chart `X` should be `sympy`, as requested for any chart on `M` by `M.set_calculus_method('sympy')`.
Prior to Sage 8.8, it was OK. The bug was actually introduced in #27601 (merged in Sage 8.8.beta1) by the accidental removal of the line 

```
self._calculus_method = method
```
in the code of `set_calculus_method()`. 

This ticket fixes it by restoring the missing line.
