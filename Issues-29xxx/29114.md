Right now both `./bootstrap` and `./configure` (via `m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4`) [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) `build/pkgs`.

In this ticket, we move this code into `bootstrap`, making the generated `configure` script more static, more straightforward to read and debug, and slightly faster because less work (and file system accesses) is done at the run time of `configure`.

Before:

```
$ time ./configure -q --without-system-ntl
real	0m40.860s
user	0m24.260s
sys	0m16.266s
```

After:

```
real	0m32.485s
user	0m20.773s
sys	0m10.462s
```

There are no changes in functionality.

We make a cosmetic fix to the `./configure --help` output, fixing ticket:33345#comment:20. 

Even after this ticket, `package-version.txt` and `dependencies` are processed at `configure` run time, not at `bootstrap` time. So simple package upgrades can still be done by developers without having to run `./bootstrap`.

I think we should progress, even if the route is not optimal, and Matthias has a lot of time for working on the build system now. 

I hate to see ./configure running many times as I launch make, it really slows working on build system down, and I hope #29113 will happen soon.

Progress on what though?  I don't think you can "progress" on unsolid footing.  I should note that part of the motivation behind #29038 is to enable the approach in #27824 which I also think is overcomplicated.

I don't think we should be making complicated changes on top of complicated changes to enable even more complicated changes.  I hate to sound like Jeroen here because I've been on the other side of disagreements like this with him.  But he'd probably be saying the same if he were here and I'd agree this time.

I would like to know what the bigger picture is to all this before making changes that don't seem well-motivated.  Don't commit a sunk cost fallacy especially when it's relatively early...

In principle this looks good to me, and Sage builds. It would be great if someone more familiar with `.m4` code could check the details.

Ok, I don't believe in parsing `SPKG.rst` for package information anyway, so I don't mind the hack. (In the futue, I would rather we quit parsing that file than try to make them all nice and consistent.)

Everything else looks reasonable. Nothing broke in my sage build and there aren't any new subtle `./configure` errors logged to the console.

John, don't forget to add yourself as a reviewer if you want to.
