```
If a sparse matrix does not contain any non-zero entries, `apply_map` fails to determine the base ring of the result:

```
sage: matrix(RR, 2, 2, sparse=True).apply_map(abs)
...
TypeError: base_ring (=Category of objects) must be a ring
```
This causes problems when computing matrix norms, for example:

```
sage: matrix(CDF, 2, 2, sparse=True).norm(1)
...
TypeError: base_ring (=Category of objects) must be a ring
```
This is solved by determining the base ring from the image of the zero entries.
