As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/6hBUt5i9FLs/RM-2eCdcBgAJ:

```
It seems that if I do

./configure  --enable-beautifulsoup4

or

./configure  --enable-pyopenssl

I get

make[3]: ***  Aucune règle pour fabriquer la cible « /home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/var/lib
/sage/installed/beautifulsoup4-none », nécessaire pour « all-sage ». Arrêt.
make[3]: *** Attente des tâches non terminées....
...

make[3]: ***  Aucune règle pour fabriquer la cible « /home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/var/lib/sage/installed/pyopenssl-none », nécessaire pour « all-sage ». Arrêt.
...

and make stops with an error.
```

We remove these options as a quick fix for 9.1.  Follow-up could be in #29097.

That's normal and this part is not really configurable in autoconf.

One can disable these warning using `--disable-option-checking`, but I don't think there is an option to change these warnings to errors.

To be honest, I was using configure with other options. Let me try again the minimal example... On my working installation of 9.1.rc2, if I do:

```
./configure  --enable-pyopenssl

I get

With the branch applied, I confirm that it is not documented anymore:

```
$ ./configure  --help | grep pyopenssl
$ ./configure  --help | grep fricas
  --enable-fricas={no|if_installed|yes}
                          enable build and use of the optional package fricas
                          package information: ./sage -info fricas
  --disable-fricas        disable build and uninstall if previously installed
                          by Sage in PREFIX; same as --enable-fricas=no
```

But still, if I decide to do it, then

```
./configure  --enable-pyopenssl
```

prints the warning `configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --enable-pyopenssl`

And then

```
MAKE='make -j8' make
```
finishes without error.

And as expected, `pyopenssl` is not installed:

```
$ sage -optional | grep pyopenssl
pyopenssl...............................19.1.0 (not_installed)
```

To me it is a positive review (for the behavior). I did not check the code itself. So I let John or Dima or someone else to change the status of the ticket to positive review if that part is good too.

My plan is to fully support `./configure --enable-PKG`. But this feature is not ready for pip packages for the 9.1 release.

I don't know whose plan it was to make `make PKG` the advertised interface. There is no ticket that outlines this plan as far as I can see.
