This patch modifies src/plot/plot.py so that when scale='semilogx' or 'loglog' is specified generate_plot_points() will sample exponentially.  This decreases the number of points necessary for an accurate plot (and also increases the chance that the default number of points will produce an acceptable plot).

Doctests pass on Debian x86-64

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thanks for working on this issue. I have few comments after reading the branch.

1. I do not agree to change the inside of `generate_plot_points`. I believe it would be cleaner to do the change of variables:

```
        f = lambda x: f_actual(exp(x))
        xrange = (log(xrange[0]), log(xrange[1]))
```
before the call to `generate_plot_point` and then do `generate_plot_point(f,xrange,...)` on the new `f` and `xrange`. Also, the part

```
    if exp_dist:
        for i in range(len(data)):
            data[i] = (exp(data[i][0]), data[i][1])
```
would go outside of the function but after the call to that function. 

2. Also, I would use the following for the name of new variables to be more explicit on what they are:

```
        f_exp = lambda x: f_actual(exp(x))
        log_xrange = (log(xrange[0]), log(xrange[1]))
```

3. I suggest to use `is_log_scale` or `log_scale` for the name of the boolean variable and avoid the `if` to define it:

```diff
-    #check to see if this is a log scale graph on the x axis
-    exp_points = False
-    if ('scale' in options.keys() and not parametric and
-            (options['scale'] == 'loglog' or options['scale'] == 'semilogx')):
-        exp_points = True
+    #check to see if this is a log scale graph on the x axis
+    log_scale = ('scale' in options.keys() and
+                  not parametric and
+                  (options['scale'] == 'loglog' or
+                   options['scale'] == 'semilogx'))
```

4. I would avoid `exp_dist=exp_points` by using the same name for the variable as for the keyword.

5. You need to add some new doctest showing that the bug is fixed (maybe with a picture). You can look at recent branch from Travis to see how he did to include picture in the doc here: #25796

<a id='comment:14'></a>What about the related `show` command on [graphics](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html)?  E.g. 

```
sage: G = plot(exp, 1, 10)
sage: G.show(scale='semiology')
```

Does this problem show up there (because if I recall correctly, the `plot` object already has the points computed before `show` is called) after this ticket is applied?

* If not, ignore this and set back to positive review.
* If so, I see two options, either of which is fine:
  * Open a new ticket for that (default)
  * Put this ticket back to needs work and fix it (if there is some pretty easy fix)

Thanks so much for fixing this.  We spent a lot of time on edge cases like this back in the day, but there were so many ... and then one has other duties.  It's so great to have lots of people still working on not just cutting-edge stuff, but more generally useful things like this.

    "body": "<a id='comment:15'></a>This patch will not work when the scale is passed to `show` rather than `plot`.  All `plot` does is create a `line` from the points it generates and add that to the `graphics` object.\n\nThe only way I could see to work as expected in that case would be to make `plot` lazy and not generate any points until the actual graphics object gets rendered.

No.  I think that people may often want to show the same plot in several different scales, and that is the beauty of separating the semantics of the graphics object and how it is shown.  If anything, it would be the other way around - but unfortunately in this case the problem here arises.
