This patch modifies src/plot/plot.py so that when scale='semilogx' or 'loglog' is specified generate_plot_points() will sample exponentially.  This decreases the number of points necessary for an accurate plot (and also increases the chance that the default number of points will produce an acceptable plot).

Doctests pass on Debian x86-64

Thanks for working on this issue. I have few comments after reading the branch.

1. I do not agree to change the inside of `generate_plot_points`. I believe it would be cleaner to do the change of variables:

```
        f = lambda x: f_actual(exp(x))
        xrange = (log(xrange[0]), log(xrange[1]))
```
before the call to `generate_plot_point` and then do `generate_plot_point(f,xrange,...)` on the new `f` and `xrange`. Also, the part

```
    if exp_dist:
        for i in range(len(data)):
            data[i] = (exp(data[i][0]), data[i][1])
```
would go outside of the function but after the call to that function. 

2. Also, I would use the following for the name of new variables to be more explicit on what they are:

```
        f_exp = lambda x: f_actual(exp(x))
        log_xrange = (log(xrange[0]), log(xrange[1]))
```

3. I suggest to use `is_log_scale` or `log_scale` for the name of the boolean variable and avoid the `if` to define it:

```diff
-    #check to see if this is a log scale graph on the x axis
-    exp_points = False
-    if ('scale' in options.keys() and not parametric and
-            (options['scale'] == 'loglog' or options['scale'] == 'semilogx')):
-        exp_points = True
+    #check to see if this is a log scale graph on the x axis
+    log_scale = ('scale' in options.keys() and
+                  not parametric and
+                  (options['scale'] == 'loglog' or
+                   options['scale'] == 'semilogx'))
```

4. I would avoid `exp_dist=exp_points` by using the same name for the variable as for the keyword.

5. You need to add some new doctest showing that the bug is fixed (maybe with a picture). You can look at recent branch from Travis to see how he did to include picture in the doc here: #25796

Incorporated your suggestions - tests pass and docs build.

Added one doctest to plot_semilogx() which does not render properly on previous versions of sage - hopefully that is sufficient.  A decent amount of the diff in the last commit is just me reverting my previous changes.

Apologize for the delay in updating this!

Thanks for the changes. No problem for the delay. Same for me, apologize for my delay in answering.

So, I looked at the code. There were still some modifications I wanted to be made. I allowed myself to make a commit on top of yours.

What about the related `show` command on [graphics](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html)?  E.g. 

```
sage: G = plot(exp, 1, 10)
sage: G.show(scale='semiology')
```

Does this problem show up there (because if I recall correctly, the `plot` object already has the points computed before `show` is called) after this ticket is applied?

* If not, ignore this and set back to positive review.
* If so, I see two options, either of which is fine:
  * Open a new ticket for that (default)
  * Put this ticket back to needs work and fix it (if there is some pretty easy fix)

Thanks so much for fixing this.  We spent a lot of time on edge cases like this back in the day, but there were so many ... and then one has other duties.  It's so great to have lots of people still working on not just cutting-edge stuff, but more generally useful things like this.

This patch will not work when the scale is passed to `show` rather than `plot`.  All `plot` does is create a `line` from the points it generates and add that to the `graphics` object.

The only way I could see to work as expected in that case would be to make `plot` lazy and not generate any points until the actual graphics object gets rendered.  One would need to capture all of the arguments (deep copy?) into an object which would then implement `_render_on_subplot` by calling `_plot`, then calling `_render_on_subplot` to the resulting line.

I'm not sure how much work that would be to do - I'm a C++ person mostly so I'm not as familiar with the python memory model (incidentally one of the reasons Sébastien had to fix my non-pythonic code; I'm not used to the scoping flexibility!).  I'm not sure if there's a way for the user to mess with variables in a way that is observable to someone who has taken a copy of the expression.

The other option (which I don't like) is to add a note in the documentation saying there's a gotcha, of course.  I don't know if anyone for whatever reason would rely on the old behavior, but then passing the scale to `show` only could be a backdoor way to re-enable it.
