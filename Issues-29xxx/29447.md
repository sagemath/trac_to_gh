Since a recent change (#29204), the ASCII and unicode art of a dictionary can fail if it contains empty strings:

```
sage: ascii_art({'a': '', '': ''})
...
  File "/Applications/SageMath/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/typeset/character_art_factory.py", line 344, in concat_no_breakpoint
    elt._breakpoints.remove(k._l + 1)
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
```

The code for building character art of dictionaries needs to take into account that the concatenation of two character art elements only inserts a breakpoint between the two elements if neither of them is empty.

I have marked the test as py3, since dictionaries do not preserve insertion order in Python 2.
