Could we add at least one little direct use for this interface, say in computing the determinants as mentioned in the ticket description?

My test case was (for M upper triangular square matrix with 1 on the diagonal)

```
det(x M^t + M)
```
versus

```
charpoly(-M (M^t)^(-1))
```
and the inversion + product + charpoly over ZZ was much faster than the det over ZZ[x]
