Keywords: neighborly polytopes

We migrate `is_neighborly` and `neighborliness` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.
It is also faster now, as use the f-vector instead of indirectly getting the number of k-faces.

Along the way we add `is_simplex` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and cache the methods `f_vector` and `n_vertices`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29565

Small coding style:

-        Returns the largest ``k``, such that the polyhedron is ``k``-neighborly.
