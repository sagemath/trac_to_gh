```
Behold:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(GF(2), 2)
sage: P.gens()
(-x, -y)
```
Those minus signs cause trouble if you try to pass them onward:

```
sage: Q = LaurentPolynomialRing(GF(2), 2, P.gens())
...
ValueError: variable name '-x' is not alphanumeric
```
I can reproduce this with the base field `GF(4)`, so it may be an issue with characteristic 2 rather than with `GF(2)` specifically.

Component: **commutative algebra**

Here is a possible fix. Instead of using the possibly absent `PolyDict.__zero` to determine the base ring, this uses the first coefficient.
