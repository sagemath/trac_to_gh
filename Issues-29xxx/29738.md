This ticket was opened to ensure that an issue raised in the comments of #10980 is not lost when that ticket is closed.

From a mathematical viewpoint, it makes sense to talk about the length of a symbolic expression:

```
sage: len(2*x^2 + 3*x - 5)
3
```
However, this is does not seem pythonic, because only container-type objects should have a `len`. Therefore, it was suggested in the comments of #10980 that it might be a good idea to take away the `len` from symbolic expressions (and this could be discussed on sage-devel).

#24080, which had proposed to add indexing, was closed as wontfix.

Related ticket: #28053 (adding length of a propositional formula function in the Logic Module)

Depends on #32139

Since `'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object is not iterable`, I agree it should have no length:

```
sage: 2*x^2 + 3*x - 5

sage: list(_)

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
Code/changes here on this ticket LGTM. I have the following minor comments:

1. Failing doctests (deprecation warning shown) which need to be updated (remove use of `len`)

2. FWIW `all_vars = set([])` could simply be `all_vars = set()` (but I know this comes from the original code

3. When fixing 2, we could directly replace

```
+        all_vars = set([])
+        all_vars.update(*[de.variables() for de in des])
```
  by

```
+        all_vars = set().union(*[de.variables() for de in des])
```

4. The change

```
-        if len(variables[0]):
+        if isinstance(variables[0], (list, tuple)):
```
seems to change its functionality. In the line after this, `variables[0][0]` is used which will fail if there is nothing in `variables[0]`. (The `variables[0][1:3]` will simply give an empty list, which seems to be intended, so no peoblem here.)
