Dan Bernstein has a paper from 2004 with an algorithm for computing the smooth parts of a bunch of integers.  I recently implemented a simple version of it (without much effort toward optimization) which can still be useful when used on long lists.

Some quick comments:
- The branch needs to be rebased.
- The patchbot has a couple of complaints about docstring formatting. Maybe also remove the spaces around `=` in examples like `n.smooth_part(B = 10)`.
- I think your product tree algorithm requires commutativity. If that's indeed the case, it should be documented and/or checked (or improved).
- I don't understand what this block is for:

  ```
  +        if not isinstance(x, Integer):
  +            x = Integer(x)
  ```
- I don't like that there are no tests covering 0, 1, and negative inputs.
