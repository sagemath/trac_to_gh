Godsil (1992) constructs strongly regular (v,k,l,mu)-graphs with v=q<sup>3</sup>, for a prime power q, and r | q+1 with

k=(q-1)((q+1)<sup>2</sup>/r -q), l=r((q+1)/r-1)<sup>3</sup> +r-3,
mu=((q+1)/r-1)((q+1)<sup>2</sup>/r-q), by taking the neighbourhood of certain antipodal cover
of K_{q<sup>3</sup>+1}.

The latter are constructed by taking GQ(q,q<sup>2</sup>) with a spread S, removing all the edges inside the lines of S,
and taking the antipodal quotient by a group generated by the element of order r fixing each line of S setwise.

GQ(q,q<sup>2</sup>) comes from the group GO<sup>-</sup>(6,q), and S is left invariant by a subgroup GU(3,q).


Keywords: strongly regular graph, srg

This is how to construct GU(3,q) in GO<sup>-</sup>(6,q) in GAP, for q=8. Here these 513 lines
are forming the spread we are after, etc
