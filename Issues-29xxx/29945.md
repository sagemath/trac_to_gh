That is a bug, isn't it?

The existing doctest has only been tested for `set_random_seed(0)`. This is how the doctesting framework is currently set up, see #29935.

```diff

Or do you want the last line of the test to be random?

This is a strange test for the method, because it really is only applied in a situation, where it might or might not work.

Or is it just testing that the result of `D.decode_to_code` is well-defined?

The real question is: Why is it a doctest, if it is not supposed to work.

There is the doctest

```
sage: G = Matrix(GF(3),[
....: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1],
....: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
....: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
....: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1]])
sage: C = LinearCode(G)
sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 2)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), 2)
sage: c = C.random_element()
sage: r = Chan(c)
sage: c == D.decode_to_code(r)
True
```

in `src/sage/coding/linear_code.py`. Why is it there? What is supposed to illustrate?

<a id='comment:7'></a>Ah, you're right, that's a bug in the doctest! I had not looked up the doctest (you hadn't given me a file/linenumber), so I incorrectly assumed that you had fuzzied the code matrix.

Indeed, the code can only correct one error. One fix would be

```
sage: D = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(C, maximum_error_weight = 1)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(C.ambient_space(), 1)
```

Then the channel always creates only one error, which is uniquely correctable with the code.

Best,
Johan

<a id='comment:11'></a>One more bug or wrong doctest:

This is a doctest in `src/sage/coding/grs_code.py` and it fails (for some reason in the doctest environment one needs a different random seed, but that shouldn't matter here):

```
sage: set_random_seed(164)
sage: F = GF(59)
sage: n, k = 40, 12
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: D = codes.decoders.GRSErrorErasureDecoder(C)
sage: c = C.random_element()
sage: n_era = randint(0, C.minimum_distance() - 2)
sage: Chan = channels.ErrorErasureChannel(C.ambient_space(), D.decoding_radius(n_era), n_era)
sage: y = Chan(c)
sage: D.connected_encoder().unencode(c) == D.decode_to_message(y)
```

For convenience:

```
sage: y
((0, 0, 37, 0, 0, 0, 46, 0, 0, 31, 0, 47, 0, 20, 50, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 32, 0, 40, 0, 0, 41, 0, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 12, 4, 0, 0),
 (1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1))
sage: c
(43, 6, 37, 9, 34, 4, 46, 0, 40, 31, 26, 47, 10, 20, 50, 3, 24, 42, 6, 50, 18, 46, 32, 45, 40, 53, 19, 41, 22, 19, 47, 27, 54, 46, 16, 15, 12, 4, 15, 58)
sage: n_era
27
```
