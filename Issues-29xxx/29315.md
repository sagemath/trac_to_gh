In the `_right_kernel_matrix` method of `matrix_integer_dense` there is a choice of 3 algorithms. With choice `algorithm='pari'` it calls the `matkerint` routine of PARI. According to the documentation this "gives an LLL-reduced â„¤-basis".
The `matker(x, flag = 1)` routine omits the LLL-reduction, and for large matrices is much faster. It seems that the `padic` and `flint` algorithms also compute this LLL-reduced form.

In some applications this LLL reduction is not necessary. 

I recommend documenting this fact and making LLL-reduction optional (but perhaps default).

In my particular application all three algorithms about equally fast, but directly calling
    `M.__pari__().matker(flag=1).mattranspose().sage()`
gives a speedup of several orders of magnitude for large matrices. (In my case sparse matrices of shape around 2000x1000.)


**Keywords:** integer matrices, kernel, speed
