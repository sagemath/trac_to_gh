```
If `P` is a multivector field and `f` is a scalar field then `f.wedge(P)` is already defined

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y,z> = M.chart()
sage: ddX = X.frame()
sage: ddx,ddy,ddz = ddX[:]
sage: P = x*ddy.wedge(ddz) + y*ddz.wedge(ddx) + z*ddx.wedge(ddy)
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x)
sage: f.wedge(P).display()
x*z d/dx/\d/dy - x*y d/dx/\d/dz + x^2 d/dy/\d/dz
```

but `P.wedge(f)` is not:

```
sage: P.wedge(f)
...
AttributeError: 'DiffScalarFieldAlgebra_with_category.element_class' object has no attribute '_ambient_domain'
```

This is the multivector field analogue of #28579.
