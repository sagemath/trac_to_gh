Welcome to Sagemath.

You could add tests of corner cases, like small graphs (empty, 1 or 2 vertices), disconnected graphs and graphs with multiple edges.

Have you tested the code on a large graph to see what it supports ?

Also, you will have to improve the coding style (see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and ensure that comments are formatted in 80 columns mode.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

a few comments
- first line of method `all_cliques`

```diff
+    Return the vertex sets of *ALL* the complete subgraphs.
+    Returns the vertex sets of *ALL* the complete subgraphs.
```
- add an `INPUT` block with the description of input parameters
- `if not graph.order():` -> `if not graph:`
- I don't understand this case `if min_size == 0 and max_size > 0:`. Not documented
- I suggest to free the graph right after the `sig_off`
- Could you improve the presentation of the code in `cl.c` and add some documentation. 

I don't know if it is possible, but it would be much better if we could turn this method into an iterator. If the number of cliques to report is large, we may have a segfault. Not clear if the design of cliquer allows that.

- The documentation is unclear on whether you search for cliques with number of vertices or edges between min and max, or if you consider the weight of the cliques. Please clarify
- if the default value of `min_size` is 0, it must be set if the input, that is `def all_cliques(graph, min_size=0, max_size=0):`
- alignement (and text) of input parameters

```diff
-    - ``min_size`` -- Search for cliques with weight at least N. If N=0,
-                      searches for maximum weight clique (default).
+    - ``min_size`` -- integer (default: 0); minimum size of the cliques to report.
+      When set to 0 (default), searched for a maximum weight clique.
```
- add doctests for the default case of the parameters
- don't sorted cliques at the end
- also, could change the branch name to something like `public/graphs/29269_all_cliques` (i.e., use in a new branch). When the branch is in `public/`, I can push review commit, which is usually faster for me.

- concerning the iterator, for the moment you can at least make method `all_cliques` yield cliques instead of returning a full list. Then we will have to find a way to make method `sage_find_all_clique` re-entrant, and so avoid to store all cliques.

In terms of making it re-entrant my first idea is (not ideal):
Making use of global variables, which are currently reseted per call.
It would require to save last graph pointer on which was call made, other parameters and saving counter.
Then each call with same graph and other parameters would just progress to next clique and return only one, while increasing counter.

Drawbacks - only 1 instance of iteration is possible, nested call on same graph with same parameters will use same counter and won't be detected as something different. Generally, it's bad solution, but I'm not familiar with C and don't know the possibilities.

Or maybe I'm wrong about how the code is executed.

For reentering something as this might be useful:

Instead of the loop

```
for (j = 0; j < sage_clique_count; j++)
```
you can pass a pointer to to `j` to the function

```
int sage_find_all_clique(graph_t *g, int **list, int min_size, int max_size, int* j)
```
On the first call `j` can be initiated to `-1` and therefore the function knows that it should initialize. Then on each further call it can just obtain partial list for `j` and return its length. If the length is `-1` this means that the iterator is exhausted.

One more thing. It would be nice if indices for counting are consistent. A few lines before you use `i` for the exact same thing. It makes it a bit easier to read if it's always `sage_clique_list[j]` or `sage_clique_list[i]`.

I see the problem.

I believe the class `MemoryAllocator` (`from sage.ext.memory_allocator cimport MemoryAllocator`) should be used here. It should definitely be used to allocate `list_of_vertices`, because there is no guarantee that we ever reach `sig_free(list_of_vertices)`. If we revisit `sage_find_all_clique` for each clique, we can even allocate `list_of_vertices` right from the start, as it only needs to fit one clique.

Instead of calling `set_free`, we can also let `MemoryAllocator` take care of it (but thats somewhat a hack). We probably need a preparation function as well. This preparation functions sets up `sage_clique_list` and takes care that for each clique `s` the pointer `&s[-1]` is stored in `MemoryAllocator`.

Then when the iterator is destroyed then so is the `MemoryAllocator`, which takes care of all the rest.

Am I making any sense?

Here are some code snippets to explain what I mean:

In `all_cliques`:

```
cdef void** clique_memory
cdef MemoryAllocator mem = MemoryAllocator()
cdef int* list_of_vertices = <int*> mem.alloc_array(max_size, sizeof(int))
cdef int num_cliques = initialize_sage_find_all_clique(g, &clique_memory, min_size, max_size)
mem.resize(num_cliques + 1)
for i in range(num_cliques):
    mem.pointers[mem.n] = clique_memory[i]
    mem.n += 1
sig_free(clique_memory)
```

Now all the memory is stored in `mem` and will be free automatically, if the iterator is interrupted.

The function `initialize_sage_find_all_clique` could look something like this:

```diff
+int initialize_sage_find_all_clique(graph_t *g,void **list, int min_size, int max_size){
+  sage_reset_global_variables();
+  quiet++;
+  maximal = FALSE;
+  int i, j, l;
+
+  clique_options *opts = sage_init_clique_opt();
+  clique_unweighted_find_all(g, min_size, max_size, maximal, opts);
+  free(opts);
+
+  int size = 0;
+  *list = malloc(sizeof(void *) * sage_clique_count);
+  for (i = 0; i < sage_clique_count; i++) {
+    list[i] = &(sage_clique_list[i][-1]);
+  }
+  return sage_clique_count

Yes, this is the idea, and all that inside a small class with a constructor, a destructor and a method `__iter__`.

My only question is whether we can have several calls to cliquer at the same time, that is if we can have to instances of the proposed iterator at the same time.

In the current implementation, `list_of_vertices` is allocated in `cl.c`. Therefore, I don't see how to put it inside a `MemoryAllocator`.
However, we can do something like that:

```diff

-            c.append(int_to_vertex[list_of_vertices[i]])

I just tried your solutions and it works just fine and is much simpler anyway:

```
sage: cython('''
....: def foo():
....:     try:
....:         while True: yield 1
....:     finally:
....:         print('hello')
....: ''')
sage: it = foo()
sage: next(it)
1
sage: del it
hello
```

So I propose changing the code like this:

```
    try:
        try:
            sig_on()
            size = sage_find_all_clique(g, &list_of_vertices, min_size, max_size)
            sig_off()
        finally:
            graph_free(g)
        cdef list c = []
        for i in range(size):
            if list_of_vertices[i] != -1:
                c.append(int_to_vertex[list_of_vertices[i]])
            else:
                yield c
                c = []
    finally:
        if list_of_vertices:  # maybe computation was interrupted before allocating `list_of_vertices`
            sig_free(list_of_vertices)
```

With a little more effort we could even ensure that `sage_clique_list` is freed even if the calculation is interrupted.

+1 for propose change. The branch is public, so we can implement it, except if gh-Fightlapa is willing to do it.

Concerning `sage_clique_list`, it's much more tricky as it is in C, not C++. Some solutions are proposed here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10586003/try-catch-statements-in-c. But we should wait for another ticket, and try to turn the code to c++ to enable the use of proper try-catch-finally statements.
