These tests can be run by adding `-python2` to the tox environment, 
such as

```
    tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-python2
    tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard-python2
```

Additionally, now `local` environments (introduced in #29104 for homebrew) respect the environment variable `EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS` that was already available for `docker` environments.
