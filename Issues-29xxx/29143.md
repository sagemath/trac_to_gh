```
#29053 added `tox.ini` to support testing the sage distribution in isolated environments via docker.

In 9.1.beta6, the generated docker files do not work due to #21785.

This ticket fixes it and also adds linux environments for various other architectures supported by docker (see https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64).

Examples:

```
$ tox -e docker-debian-buster-standard-i386
$ tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard-arm64
$ tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-minimal-armhf
$ tox -e docker-fedora-31-standard-arm64v8         # Docker for Mac only
$ tox -e docker-ubuntu-latest-standard-s390x       # Docker for Mac only
```

(The last two work with macOS Docker Desktop because it has `binfmt_misc` with `qemu` enabled.)

+
+This ticket adds linux environments for various other architectures supported by docker (see https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64).
+
+Examples:

+```

+(The last two work with macOS Docker Desktop because it has `binfmt_misc` with `qemu` enabled.)
