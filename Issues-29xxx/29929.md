- Add a homebrew environment `local-homebrew-macos-usrlocal` that uses the global homebrew in `/usr/local`. This will be faster and may be more robust for [GitHub](GitHub) Actions builds because "bottles" of more packages can be used. (For a while, for example, all `homebrew-standard` builds fail because the homebrew `ppl` package cannot be installed from source - https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/57499)

- Disable testsuites that need pip (ssl)



This is on top of:

- Also, add "make dist" testing to tox.ini (prompted by breakage in #29825). This is #30088

- Add a macos environment without homebrew, conda: That's a configuration that was causing trouble in #29706 and is so far not tested in the [GitHub](GitHub) CI tests. This is added by #30088 too (`make dist`)

I'll repeat a comment I made at #29706: I really needed an environment without homebrew to replicate the failures; just having a minimal homebrew installation, or having one with temporarily moved `pkgconfig` directories, wasn't enough to get the failures.

(So I'm emphasizing that I'm agreeing with the summary: "without homebrew".)
