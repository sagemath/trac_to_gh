The search syntax for Number fields in the LMFDB was recently changed, which broke the function `lmfdb_page` for number fields, as it caused the browser to navigate to a link no longer understood by the LMFDB.

I think that it was hoped to include all of this code in Sage at some point, but perhaps just lifting one function is a good start!
