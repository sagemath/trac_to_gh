With respect, I think it adds much additional complication without justifying itself or what concrete problems it's trying to solve.

I had to work on other things for a while so I stepped away from the discussion, but I never would have approved it.

Let's please roll this back and stop making major changes to the build system until we can get some clarity on what the overall goals of these changes are.

Please consider this an alternative to #29114 which is adding still more complications to work around a regression introduced by #29038.  I think it would be simpler for now to roll back #29038 until we can re-assess.

In the meantime, please see #29119 which offers an alternative approach which I believe is more in the spirit of making sagelib buildable independently of sage-the-distribution without any non-standard external scripts.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I think we should progress rather than revert, as Matthias has a clear and mostly ready path towards making sagelib runnable in venv of a system Python, something that is close to pip installability. 

Noone else is close to this, and simplifications may happen later.

Besides, there are no regressions introduced in  #29038 - a way to implement something that you don't like, but it works, is not a regression, it is a design choice that you make or may not like.

<a id='comment:3'></a>> runnable in venv of a system Python


The virtualenv stuff is also a red herring.  It should be pip-installable directly into a system Python's site-packages too.  If that's possible then installing into a virtualenv also works more-or-less trivially.  If we have to do much anything special in the case of a virtualenv then we're probably doing someting wrong.

This was part of the point of my approach in #29032 which I believe accomplishes the same goals with far less intervention.  I could be wrong about that, but no one has suggested otherwise yet.

I don't think you are right here. Having sagelib working in venv of a system python is almost as good as direct pip-installing, as it allows to get away from endlessly rebuilding python system packages.

Installing sagelib directly into system python packages is useless from development point of view. It's good as a final goal, but we're far from it.
You don't want to trash your system python every time things go wrong.

No we're not.  Distro packagers already do it.  When it comes down to it it's just another Python package, with some variables in `sage.env` you have to configure (the problem we are trying to solve is that that part is currently too difficult to configure, which is why packagers often just replace `sage.env` with their own hard-coded one).

> You don't want to trash your system python every time things go wrong.


Yes, that's what virtualenvs are for.  But there's nothing special about it otherwise.  `$SAGE_LOCAL` is no different in function from a virtualenv--it's just an alternate install prefix, like `/usr/local`.

So? You get something that you can only change is you have root.
Are you seriosly proposing that Sage developent should be done as root?

Sage with its`SAGE_LOCAL` is not a Python virtual environment, it's more Conda-like virtual environment. I think it's agreed that we don't want to be another Conda, but rather try to undo this. By continuing to do custom things to `SAGE_LOCAL` instead of using correct Python tools, e.g. Python modules, Python venv, we work against the latter goal.

Wrapping some of Sage's spaghetti configuration into a Python module --- that's what #29038 mostly does and why it is welcome, cause it's a move in the right direction, from a place where much feet-dragging has taken place (so yes indeed, disruptive, in the positive sense).

By continuing to do custom things to `SAGE_LOCAL` instead of using correct Python tools, e.g. Python modules, Python venv, we work against the latter goal.


I'm sorry, but this is meaningless.

Can you please explain to me exactly what you think a virtualenv/venv is in Python?  Because I think you ascribe a lot more depth and complexity to it than it actually is.

In practice there's little distinction between a virtualenv and a Conda env.  In fact, Conda started out originally as part of the build system for Anaconda's spiritual predecessor, Canopy.  Back then it was just a virtualenv plus some additional bells-and-whistles (such as setting the correct environment variables) to be able to install non-Python packages into it.  The main difference with Conda envs--where they went beyond the original concept--was to not be tied to a specific Python interpreter--but in fact allow installing different Pythons into the environment as well.

I don't see where you get the idea that this discussion has anything to do with "custom things to `SAGE_LOCAL`".  If anything it's the opposite.  I am trying to treat SAGE_LOCAL as *less* special.

I and other distro maintainers have tools to build (and normally to run package testsuite in most case) without having to install the full package or needing root access. I even can do it with a given git branch. Of course we still need to install the dependencies but that's a given.

+1

Additionally, nix doesn't even need root at all. It would be a perfectly viable replacement to sage's own build system for sage-development purposes. I already thought about suggesting that in the past, but I didn't since I don't have the time to work on it / convince people myself.

Edit: Now that I think about it I think I did suggest it once. One downside was that there would be no cygwin support, just WSL. Or someone would have to work on reviving nix on cygwin, not sure what it's current state is.

I agree with Erik and François that adding a package juts for configuration makes things a bit more difficult, at least for packagers. Instead of patching a file, we now have to add another python package and essentially re-write it.

I haven't looked at the details of the implementation though, I'm mostly commenting on what I understand from the title and the description.

In any case, thank you for your work `@`mkoeppe. It definitely has the right intention.

While I made that comment, I had in mind tasks of Sage development rather than Sage's packaging. Developers don't have or don't know how to use these distro-specific tools,
e.g. I hate to think of the sort of hoops one has to jump through to uninstall a system-wide Python package on MacOS.

That's why venv comes quite handy.

Yeah, I don't have any idea where this idea of having to use root came from.  Installing into the site-packages of any Python in any prefix (virtualenv or no virtualenv) is exactly the same process.  virtualenv doesn't even enter into it.  I cannot stress this enough, but you (Dima and Matthias) seem to be **very confused** about what the purpose and functionality of virtualenv is.

I cannot stress this enough, but you (Dima and Matthias) seem to be **very confused** about what the purpose and functionality of virtualenv is.  It's just a tool to create a new install prefix under user control that can also link to an existing system Python without having to completely reinstall Python.  That's it.  That's all it is.


yes, venv is a tool. It's already there, it's standard. Use it, don't re-invent the wheel with textfiles you need to parse...

<a id='comment:24'></a>This would still be a prerequisite and there's already a branch so why not.

I had a thought that might elucidate the issue about virtualenvs / install prefixes, etc.

Python also supports something even more basic called USER_BASE--this predates virtualenv and venv by quite a long time.  It's just another notion of an alternate install prefix--the difference is it doesn't even link to an existing python interpreter or change the interpreter's `sys.prefix`.  It's just an alternate prefix (like `/usr/local`) which goes to the front of the path, but that can live in individual users' home directories; on *NIX systems it is `~/.local`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE

By default (unless it's disabled, which you can control with some environment variables, a usercustomize.py, etc.) it is enabled, and if `~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` exists it supersedes the system site-packages on `sys.path`.  Of course, since this is a full root prefix, you can also have a `~/.local/bin` and such.  So when you run `pip install --user` on a package, for example, any files it installs go into the `~/.local/` prefix, including scripts, share data, etc.  Of course, it's the user's responsibly to add `~/.local/bin` to their `PATH` if they want to use it.

This scheme is used by other tools as well I believe; for example I always install ruby gems into my `~/.local`.

This is again to emphasize that virtualenv is not special and not the only context in which you'd want to install a Python package into a prefix that has nothing to with virtualenv, `/usr`, `$SAGE_LOCAL`, or any of that (`$SAGE_LOCAL` is sort of like a special case of `~/.local` but specific to sage-the-distribution.  When you run Sage's `./configure` you can even do something like `./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local`, and `$SAGE_LOCAL` is just a fancy synonym for `$prefix`.  This is just discouraged for *development* in sage-the-distribution in order to keep it isolated from other install prefixes so that problems are easier to track down.
