Old-style SPKGs were deprecated in #19158, merged in Sage 6.9.

There is only sparse evidence of non-broken old-style SPKGs:

- `cunningham_tables` - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/T4IO-AmOsCM/HYy_N6UdAQAJ - added as new-style package in #29834

- `polytopes_db_4d` - added as new-style package in #26029

We remove support for old-style packages, but we keep the command `sage -p`, which can also be used for installing a new-style package without dependencies.
