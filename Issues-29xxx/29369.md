Nothing unusual here except that this is a C++ library with no pkg-config file, and that makes it a bit harder to search for. I've assumed that any version we find is acceptable, which probably is not quite true.

This is a matter for another ticket but I think the python part should be merged into sage proper.
A bit of history.
PolyBoRi use to have its own python bindings. sage also had its own python bindings to PolyBoRi. The python part of PolyBoRI (now BRiAl) could work with either the PolyBoRI or sage bindings. In BRiAl we never bothered with porting the python bindings of PolyBoRi - they are not there anymore. I removed all bits that could have used the PolyBoRi bindings from what is now sage-brial in Gentoo. So at the moment
* Brial is needed to build sage because sage builds binding to brial
* sage-brial needs sage's binding at runtime to be usable
* sage needs sage-brial at run time for some stuff

I think sage-brial should just be merged in sage.

Ah, I didn't realize that sage's brial is installing TWO things, both the C++ library and a python package. I've only detected the C++ library, so this will have to wait until something happens with python -- either adding support for system python modules, or just moving sage-brial into sage in this case.

> a less invasive option that moving sage-brial into sage would be to split the package into two parts, python and non-python (they may use the same tarball). Then the work done here is perfectly useful for brial proper, and sage-brial becomes another story.

Yeah, for now this is the path of least resistance (although the whole thing can probably be copy/pasted into src/sage/libs/brial). I factored the python module out into a new standard sage_brial package and now everything looks OK.

<div id="comment:23" align="right">comment:23</div>

Because it depends on m4ri and we only accept very new versions of that, this only uses brial on very few system configurations.
`ubuntu-eoan-python2` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774470), `ubuntu-focal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774488) and `archlinux-latest-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774841) work well.
The test failures on `debian-bullseye-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774574) are probably unrelated.

There's no brial package for homebrew, so there's nothing to test.

But it does not find brial on `fedora-31-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/537774738). Please take a look
