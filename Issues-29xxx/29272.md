This is the error when doctesting in src/sage/rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py:

Probably requires a simple change in the doctest.

Another solution (that I should check with Xavier and Julian about) is to remove the experimental designation.  We haven't worked on the lattice precision interface for a while, so maybe we should just think about what interface changes we want to make, make them, and then remove these warnings.

We've got a work week planned in mid April where we could look into this.

This issue does not occur when running the long tests, but only when running the short tests, so this is not a problem on the patchbots. This might be a weird interaction between the doctest framework filtering duplicate warnings and the `experimental` decorator trying to avoid duplicate warnings.

This problem can be solved by reordering the doctests, so that the long test cases are executed after the short ones. Here is a branch that does this.
