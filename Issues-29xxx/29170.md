https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/configure.ac#L1108
In this situation, the macro `R_PROG_FC_CHAR_LEN_T` (from `m4/R.m4`) produces an empty `$r_cv_prog_fc_char_len_t`, which causes the compilation errors. Error checking should be added either in the macro or in the macro call.

Upstream does not have an open bug reporting system. Perhaps an R user can communicate this problem to upstream.
