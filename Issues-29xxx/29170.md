Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A33):
> `R_PROG_FC_CHAR_LEN_T` might be buggy, it does not use any "normal" autoconf macros for test programs, doing instead pure shell.

I think you're right and we would wind up with `-fPIC` added for this one check if they had used the autotools magic. Adding `-fPIC` globally works around the issue, but isn't a good long-term solution (Case 3 in https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:AMD64/Fixing_-fPIC_Errors_Guide).

Since the compile/link command is hard-coded into `R_PROG_FC_CHAR_LEN_T`, can we append `-fPIC` for just the one check? Then upstream should be able to either do the same thing, or use some autotools stuff to fix it in the future.
