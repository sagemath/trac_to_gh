Ok, I read that whole thread so no one else has to. Ultimately, this is due to broken code that needs to be updated. The GCC developers have done two things:

We can probably just update gfortran's spkg-configure.m4 to ensure a new-enough version. Maybe for now it would suffice to check if the `-ftail-call-workaround` flag is supported. That would rule out older compilers from before things were broken, but is easy to implement.
