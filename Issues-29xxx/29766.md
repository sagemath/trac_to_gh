Follow-up from the update of numpy to 1.16.6 (#29429):

We update
* https://pypi.org/project/numpy/ to 1.19.1 (latest as of 2020-07-21)
* https://pypi.org/project/scipy/ to 1.5.2 (latest as of 2020-07-31)
* networkx to the latest release, 2.4 (latest as of 2020-07-04)
All of the above versions support Python >= 3.6.

One deprecation warning is removed here, another suppressed (from #29425), 
the rest it trivial.

Tarballs: see checksums.ini [upstream_url]

Minor (perhaps trivial) point, but pulling it from that link gave a zip file named `networkx-networkx-2.4.zip`, which caused it to fail without manually downloading and naming the tarball correctly.


With this ticket, I get two deprecation warnings in `generic_graph.py` on these two tests:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9786, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy") # abs tol 1e-9

File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9793, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy", by_weight=True) # abs tol 1e-9
```

as to the url - I guess it's something to do with [GitHub](GitHub) naming of archives.

I don't quite understand what "pulling it from that link" means. The idea of 
`upstream_url` in `checksum.ini` is to allow automatic download of the package archive from that URL. (which can either be enabled with `-o`, as follows, `./sage -i -o networkx` of if one runs `./configure` with `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option).

And this automation works for me on Linux. The ULR is copied verbatim from https://github.com/networkx/networkx/releases/tag/networkx-2.4

Okay, I tried with just `make` instead of directly with `sage -i` (which worked by itself when I did this on another spkg previously), so maybe that is why it didn't work. I was just thinking it came from the zip file having an unexpected name.

Doesn't that also hide deprecation warnings coming from sage code, and thus would prevent detecting such deprecated code use with future scipy/networkx updates? That sort of defeats the point of the previous

```
    deprecationWarning = ('ignore', None, DeprecationWarning, None, 0)
    if deprecationWarning in warnings.filters: warnings.filters.remove(deprecationWarning)
```

`module='.*(scipy|networkx)'` suppresses deprecation warnings emitted by code in `scipy` or in `networkx`. It does not do anything to these warnings from Sage code itself.
Indeed, the tests in `src/sage/tests/deprecation_test.py` still pass.

needless to say, each upgrade to scipy|networkx will need to re-evaluate these.

We should add something to the Developer manual on this.
