Follow-up from the update of numpy to 1.16.6 (#29429):

We update
* https://pypi.org/project/numpy/ to 1.19.1 (latest as of 2020-07-21)
* https://pypi.org/project/scipy/ to 1.5.2 (latest as of 2020-07-31)
* networkx to the latest release, 2.4 (latest as of 2020-07-04)
All of the above versions support Python >= 3.6.

One deprecation warning is removed here, another suppressed (from #29425), 
the rest it trivial.

Tarballs: see checksums.ini [upstream_url]

Depends on #29929

Minor (perhaps trivial) point, but pulling it from that link gave a zip file named `networkx-networkx-2.4.zip`, which caused it to fail without manually downloading and naming the tarball correctly.


With this ticket, I get two deprecation warnings in `generic_graph.py` on these two tests:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9786, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy") # abs tol 1e-9

File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9793, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy", by_weight=True) # abs tol 1e-9
```

I didn't fully merge #29425 into this branch. I can do it (must I?), or leave it to the release manager.

as to the url - I guess it's something to do with [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) naming of archives.

I don't quite understand what "pulling it from that link" means. The idea of 
`upstream_url` in `checksum.ini` is to allow automatic download of the package archive from that URL. (which can either be enabled with `-o`, as follows, `./sage -i -o networkx` of if one runs `./configure` with `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option).

And this automation works for me on Linux. The ULR is copied verbatim from https://github.com/networkx/networkx/releases/tag/networkx-2.4

Okay, I tried with just `make` instead of directly with `sage -i` (which worked by itself when I did this on another spkg previously), so maybe that is why it didn't work. I was just thinking it came from the zip file having an unexpected name.

It appears I figured out this issue; doing

appears to fix it - still testing, but expect a success.
Basically, we already did suppression of deprecation warnings
from other packages right, now the same has to be done for `scipy` and `networkx`

Doesn't that also hide deprecation warnings coming from sage code, and thus would prevent detecting such deprecated code use with future scipy/networkx updates? That sort of defeats the point of the previous

```
    deprecationWarning = ('ignore', None, DeprecationWarning, None, 0)

`module='.*(scipy|networkx)'` suppresses deprecation warnings emitted by code in `scipy` or in `networkx`. It does not do anything to these warnings from Sage code itself.
Indeed, the tests in `src/sage/tests/deprecation_test.py` still pass.

needless to say, each upgrade to scipy|networkx will need to re-evaluate these.

We should add something to the Developer manual on this.

It keeps "nose pytest" only when running the `networkx` test suite is requested.

Because these are testsuite-only dependencies.

Yes, there is a problem - thanks for catching it. 

I am running GH Actions build with `SAGE_CHECK=warn`, and the code added in #30118 does not handle the exclusions given in SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES in that case. 

Let's change that.
