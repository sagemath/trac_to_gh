Follow-up from the update of numpy to 1.16.6 (#29429):

We update
* https://pypi.org/project/numpy/ to 1.19.1 (latest as of 2020-07-21)
* https://pypi.org/project/scipy/ to 1.5.2 (latest as of 2020-07-31)
* networkx to the latest release, 2.4 (latest as of 2020-07-04)
All of the above versions support Python >= 3.6.

One deprecation warning is removed here, another suppressed (from #29425), 
the rest it trivial.

Tarballs: see checksums.ini [upstream_url]

With this ticket, I get two deprecation warnings in `generic_graph.py` on these two tests:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9786, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy") # abs tol 1e-9

File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 9793, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    G.pagerank(algorithm="Scipy", by_weight=True) # abs tol 1e-9
```

I don't quite understand what "pulling it from that link" means. The idea of 
`upstream_url` in `checksum.ini` is to allow automatic download of the package archive from that URL. (which can either be enabled with `-o`, as follows, `./sage -i -o networkx` of if one runs `./configure` with `--enable-download-from-upstream-url` option).

And this automation works for me on Linux. The ULR is copied verbatim from https://github.com/networkx/networkx/releases/tag/networkx-2.4

Okay, I tried with just `make` instead of directly with `sage -i` (which worked by itself when I did this on another spkg previously), so maybe that is why it didn't work. I was just thinking it came from the zip file having an unexpected name.

`module='.*(scipy|networkx)'` suppresses deprecation warnings emitted by code in `scipy` or in `networkx`. It does not do anything to these warnings from Sage code itself.
Indeed, the tests in `src/sage/tests/deprecation_test.py` still pass.
