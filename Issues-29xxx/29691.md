The current method `__call__` calls `_reduce_point` which only takes a characteristic `p` as a parameter and returns the point over the curve base changed to `GF(p)`. This works for finite fields but does not for `Z/NZ`.

For example for the curve:
`y^2 + y == x^3 - x`
the point `(2:-3:8)` does not reduce correctly mod `4`:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,1,-1,0]);E4 = E.change_ring(Integers(4))
sage: E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x over Rational Field
sage: P = E(2,-3,8); P
(1/4 : -3/8 : 1)
sage: E4(P)
(0 : 1 : 0)
```
And the reduction should be `(2:1:0)`. 

This simple patch solves this issue. It requires #29690 however. 

Depends on #29690
