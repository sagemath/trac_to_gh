This is a follow-up from #28225 - "Allow sage to run in the absence of `sage-env`". The present ticket also allows `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` to run and import `sage.all` in the absence of the shell script `sage-env`. (Getting a fully functional `sage.all` is future work.)

This ticket also makes sagelib more independent from the environment variables set by `src/bin/sage-env` (`local/bin/sage-env`), and to remove assumptions regarding install locations of sagelib relative to `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

- To support users who want to install an experimental version of sagelib in other install locations, such as in a user site packages directory.
- For making sagelib available in a user's venv, as in the following example:
   Without this ticket:
   {{{
   $ sage -python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/personal-sage-venv/
   $ source ~/personal-sage-venv/bin/activate
   (personal-sage-venv) $ python
   >>> import sage.env
   >>> sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL
   '/Users/mkoeppe/personal-sage-venv'                                     # wrong
   >>> import sage.all
   RuntimeError: You must get the file local/bin/sage-maxima.lisp
   }}}
   With this ticket:
   {{{
   >>> sage.env.SAGE_LOCAL
   '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local'
   >>> import sage.all
   >>> sage.all.maxima('1')
   1
   }}}
- To support #29013/#27824: spkg-configure.m4 for python3
- To make it possible for distributions to use a stock `src/sage/env.py` (providing a custom `src/sage/env_conf.py`).

In a first step, we just set `SAGE_LOCAL` and `MAXIMA` (to the location of the `maxima` binary), but also `SAGE_ROOT` could be added (for developer conveniences such as sage.misc.edit_module; see also #25486); and later packages' `spkg-configure` might be setting `MATHJAX_DIR` etc. 

In a follow-up ticket, `src/sage/env_config.py` would actually be generated by `src/setup.py`, not `configure`.

**Ticket #29038 provides an alternative implementation that uses an standalone installed Python module `sage_conf`, rather than writing into `src/sage`**

1) With #29013, `os.path.abspath(sys.prefix)` is the location of the venv, and not equal to `SAGE_LOCAL`.

2) If one starts Sage's Python directly, without going through `sage-env`, then the environment variable `SAGE_LOCAL` is not set; and in this case it is retrieved from `env_config.py`.

For your points
 1) OK - I get it, that's a problem

 2) I am perfectly happy with it being set as `os.path.abspath(sys.prefix)` if `sage-env` is not loaded as it is now. But your alternative is acceptable and of course solves your issue at (1).

I removed `sage-env` completely from sage-on-gentoo a number of releases ago and it does work nicely with very little patching (I upstreamed most of it). There is only one place now where I have to replace a call to `SAGE_ROOT` at runtime (in `sage.misc.copying`). I'd say sage works at 99.99% out of the box without needing `sage-env`, in particular you should be able to call it directly from python. 

However 
 1) your venv work may introduce a few disparities

 2) being able to override some default from a standardised configuration file instead of patching for your distro values is very appealing.

I don't particularly need `SAGE_ROOT` to be set (in fact `None` suits me just fine since it doesn't make much sense on a distro), it was just my misconception on what you were doing.

Yes, I agree that SAGE_ROOT is not very important, but it's still used for developer convenience functions like those in `sage.misc.edit_module`.

`SAGE_ROOT` is mentioned in the documentation string for `edit_devel` but is otherwise absent. The bit in documentation should have been amended at the same time as https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/c352b1d5920ce9ffaebada2fe172784b2ba3e3fb#diff-141c6e649507c15775d157f417db1e26 I guess.

Almost all of the `SAGE_ROOT` stuff left pertains to packaging I think.

`sys.prefix` may not be, but even in a venv `sysconfig.get_config_var('prefix')` will always give you the original install prefix for Python, which when using Sage's Python *will* be `SAGE_LOCAL`.

For example, a file like this could be generated at build time by running something like:

```
$ (source src/bin/sage-env-config && env | grep '^SAGE_' | sort)
SAGE_ARB_LIBRARY=arb
SAGE_CONFIGURE_FLINT=--with-flint=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP=--with-gmp=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CONFIGURE_MPC=--with-mpc=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CONFIGURE_MPFR=--with-mpfr=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CONFIGURE_NTL=--with-ntl=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CONFIGURE_PARI=--with-pari=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_CRTI_DIR=
SAGE_FLINT_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_FREETYPE_PREFIX=
SAGE_GLPK_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/include
SAGE_GMP_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_LOCAL=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_MPC_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_NTL_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_PARI_CFG=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/pari/pari.cfg
SAGE_PARI_PREFIX=/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
SAGE_PKG_CONFIG_PATH=
SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=2
```

It could be output to a .py module that's (optionally) imported by `sage.env`, or just a ".env" file (a common extension being used in recent years for a file like this that specifies some environment variables for a project).  Distros, if they wish, could write their own version of this file without patching.

If that's the case, I don't think `env_config.py.in` should even be directly in the sage package.  But I also think this file should not go directly into the sage package at all.  It would be better if it were external to the sage package's source tree; but it could still be generated and installed along with the package, but that would be a step handled by setup.py.

It's the autoconf standard to have templates right next to the file they are templating.

I actually agree with that, as you can see in the ticket description: **In a follow-up ticket, src/sage/env_config.py would actually be generated by src/setup.py, not configure.**

>  I also still fail to see the point of making it an actual Python module.


It's the easiest way to import values into Python, without having to fight about the "correct" file format to use. toml, anyone?

I think if we started with that, and put the .in file just directly under src/ instead of src/sage I'd be less concerned about this (I still don't see the need, but I wouldn't fight it as much).

I already suggested a ".env" format which is just one "KEY=VALUE" per line, and can also be sourced by shell scripts.

By making it a Python module in src/sage, it is installed by the standard facilities (`setup.py`) that already work now, not in some unspecified future.

In #29038 I now do exactly that. Thanks for the input.

I'm sorry, what you did in that ticket is not what I meant at all, and that's my fault for not being clearer and more explicit.  What I had in mind here was this:

* I was unclear when I wrote "external to the sage package's source tree".  What I meant was (relative to the git repository), still in `src/`, but not in `src/sage`.

* These settings (whether written by sage-the-distribution's configure script, or by hand by a packager) would be written by `src/setup.py` into a file that *is* installed in the `sage` package.

An analogy I would use is `numpy.__config__`.  If you look at it, and Numpy's setup.py, you can see that it's generated and installed inside the numpy package.  This is close to what you are trying to do, but just a different approach to how the file is installed.

I'm still -1 on it being a .py module, but if you feel strongly about that I'd take it as long as we can do the rest more like Numpy does.

Numpy's solution, expecting a configuration file in its to-be-installed sources, is outdated (and, by the way, untested by upstream) because it is incompatible with pip-installing from a source other than a local directory.

Let's continue the discussion in #29038.

I dont think so; you could also pass the configuration by other means but it's just an example.  I don't see how #29038 makes this any better.  Now you have to have a whole external Python module to do the same thing.

We can make ./bootstrap to generate a tarball of it in upstream/ just as it's done
