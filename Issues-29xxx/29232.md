Initial report by Ingo Dahn at:

- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/cocalc/rblsUHwBXQc/discussion

Minimal example:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01'
sage: sage: std([float(3.2), float(3.4)])
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```

Fix this by changing the function `std(v, bias)` at line 219 of
`src/sage/stats/basic_stats.py`:

```
-    return variance(v, bias=bias).sqrt()
+    try:
+        return variance(v, bias=bias).sqrt()
+     except AttributeError:
+        from sage.functions.other import sqrt
+        return sqrt(variance(v, bias=bias))
```

It turns out this was already fixed at #29184, merged in Sage 9.1.beta5.
