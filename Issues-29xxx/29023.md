This is a followup on #27824: `spkg-configure.m4` for python3.

In the next step, we make it possible for users to enable use of system Python packages (site packages).

It is crucial to distinguish two categories of Python packages.

**A. Python-implemented applications not running in the same process as sagelib**

For some specific packages that provide Python-implemented applications and do not run in the same process as `sagelib`, there are separate tickets that may use `spkg-configure.m4`

- #30124 enables use of system packages for the Python packages `notebook` (#30124), `rst2ipynb`, and their dependencies. 

'''B. Packages that run in the same process as sagelib.``

Use of these packages would be enabled by a new configure option `--enable-system-site-packages`. 

This will set up the venv using `build/bin/sage-venv --system-site-packages`

*Approach 1:*

- #29665: `configure --enable-system-site-packages` via `spkg-configure.m4`

*Approach 2:*

- Separate the installation process of a Python package into several phases (makefile targets):

  i) Downloading the spkg tarball (in most cases the tarball will already be an sdist, i.e., with embedded metadata)

  ii) (When patches are needed or the upstream tarball is not a real sdist:) Unpack, patch, make a new sdist

  iii) Copy the sdist to `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` or a new directory next to it

  iv) Build a wheel and copy to `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`

  v) Install the wheel

Questions to be resolved:

- #32492#comment:17 -- installed packages are only considered by pip if they can also be found in an index.  As we use `--no-index`, the workaround in #32492 provides the directory `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` as the index. 

  To be checked if the specific installed version of the package needs to be found in the index. If presence of any version (= spkg version) will cause pip to consider the installed version as a candidate for resolution, then we can just leave the decision whether to use the installed package or the spkg to the resolver and the pip upgrade-strategy. 

  If a package needs any special preparation for building a wheel such as setting of environment variables, we need to:

  a) either invoke phase iv) explicitly (so wheels of such packages may be built but remain unused);

  b) or try to move the environment settings to the general build environment; 

  c) or patch the Python package's build script instead, treating it like phase ii).

- If we need a specific version (with patches that have not been upstreamed), should this be reflected in dependency information (`install-requires.txt`)?

- Investigate pip's and other tools behavior when installing an upgraded/downgraded version of a package in the venv when the package is installed in the system site packages

Related/follow-up tickets:
- #31543 Meta-ticket: Eliminate use of patches for Python packages
- #29041 at `./bootstrap` time, generate `requirements.txt`, `constraints.txt`, `setup.cfg [install_requires]`, `Pipfile` from `build/pkgs`
- #30578 Add `src/requirements.txt` and `src/setup.cfg [install_requires]` for installation of `sagelib` in a venv
- #30371 In-place (editable) installs of `sagelib` in a venv

Tickets/issues for individual packages (moved here from #27330, will be obsolete with this ticket):
* numpy
* scipy
* cypari (depends on pari)

You can already do `./configure --with-system-python3=no` to avoid using the system's Python.

Is it likely that there will be a good system Python installation which has faulty Python packages?
