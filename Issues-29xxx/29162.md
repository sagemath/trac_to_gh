This ticket fixes this by building `gfortran` using system `g++` without passing the `-std=gnu++11` flags.

<a id='comment:1'></a>so, Sage's gfortran cannot be built with an ancient gcc. Nothing really new about it.

Perhaps the most meaningful fix would be to gfortran's spkg-configure to error out on not finding a system gfortran and finding an old gcc...

apparently gfortran is more picky.

I really don't see a point of not having gfortran as a pre-req on Linux.
