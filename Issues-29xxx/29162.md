This ticket fixes this by building `gfortran` using system `g++` without passing the `-std=gnu++11` flags.

so, Sage's gfortran cannot be built with an ancient gcc. Nothing really new about it.

Perhaps the most meaningful fix would be to gfortran's spkg-configure to error out on not finding a system gfortran and finding an old gcc...

if gcc is built then gfortran will be built with the new gcc.

apparently gfortran is more picky.

I really don't see a point of not having gfortran as a pre-req on Linux.

What's happening here is that gfortran 9.2 cannot build without bootstrapping when the old g++ is invoked as `g++ -std=gnu++11`. This is apparently a build configuration untested by upstream.  The ticket fixes it by avoiding the `-std=gnu++11` flag (which is globally added to `$CXX` by `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` on old compilers).

The ticket is on top of #29052 (which needs review...)
