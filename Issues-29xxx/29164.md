```
The following commands run "instantly":

```
sage: log (0.0)
-infinity
sage: log (0.0, 2)
-infinity
sage: log (0)
-Infinity
```

But the command

```
sage: log (0, 2)
```
takes a very long time (at least a few minutes). Moreover, the python process needs to be killed, using Ctrl+C does not work to stop the computation.

I was able to reproduce the bug with Sage 9.0 (using Python3) and Sage 8.9 (using Python2). But i was not able to reproduce the bug with Sage 7.6.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
In `sage.rings.integer.Integer.exact_log`, this triggers a `ValueError`:

```
if mpz_sgn(self.value) <= 0 or mpz_sgn(_m.value) <= 0:
    raise ValueError("both self and m must be positive")
```

In your example, `self.value` is 0 and `_m.value` is 2. It seems to me like it would be better to return `-infinity` instead of raising this error if `self.value` is 0, but in a sense that is beside the point. What instead happens is that this `ValueError` is in a try-except in `sage.functions.log.log`:

```
    try:
        return args[0].log(args[1])
    except ValueError as ex:
        if repr(ex)[12:27] == "No discrete log":
            raise
        return logb(args[0], args[1])
```

Here, `args[0]` is 0 and `args[1]` is 2. Calling the function `logb` results in the same `ValueError` and the same try-except, and thus an infinite loop. 

To avoid this, `-infinity` needs to be returned at some point. I think that point should be in `sage.rings.integer.Integer.exact_log`, immediately before raising the `ValueError`.
