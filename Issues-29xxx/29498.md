> Related: is there some way to detect if --enable-gp2c was passed? We shouldn't have to run this code at all, by default.

Unfortunately, although (after a recent change) the `SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE` calls are emitted in `m4/sage_spkg_configures.m4` before the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_*` calls, the shell code that sets the "enable" variables still ends up after the shell code from the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_*` (because of autoconf reordering magic).

We would have to move the `SAGE_SPKG_ENABLE` calls even earlier, i.e., before the `m4_sinclude`s of the `spkg-configure.m4`.
