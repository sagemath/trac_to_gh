<a id='comment:7'></a>
Really surprising.

If `x` and `y` are real and not both zero, `arctan2(y, x)`
gives the angle (in the interval `(-pi, pi]`) from the
horizontal direction to that of the line through `(0, 0)`
and `(x, y)`.

Examples:

```
sage: arctan2(0, 1)
0
sage: arctan2(1, 1)
1/4*pi
sage: arctan2(1, 0)
1/2*pi
sage: arctan2(0, -1)
pi
```

Whenever `y > 0` the result of `arctan2(y, 0)` must be zero.

And indeed:

```
sage: arctan2(0, 2)
0
sage: arctan2(0, sqrt(3))
0
sage: arctan2(0, sqrt(3) + 1)
0
```
but the surprise comes with:

```
sage: arctan2(0, sqrt(3) - 1)
arctan2(0, sqrt(3) - 1)
```
even though

```
sage: bool(sqrt(3) - 1 > 0)
True
```
and two correct answers followed an incorrect one below:

```
sage: bool(arctan2(0, sqrt(3) - 1))  # is it nonzero
False
sage: bool(arctan2(0, sqrt(3) - 1) == 0)  # is it zero
True
sage: bool(arctan2(0, sqrt(3) - 1) != 0)  # is it nonzero
True
```
