Checksum of brial-1.2.5.tar.bz2 unchanged
```
or

```
% ./sage --package fix-checksum sage_brial
Updating checksum of brial-1.2.8.tar.bz2
```
This ticket proposes changing the message to

```
Checksum of sage_brial (tarball brial-1.2.5.tar.bz2) unchanged
```
or

```
Updating checksum of sage_brial (tarball brial-1.2.8.tar.bz2)
```
