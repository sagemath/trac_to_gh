Follow-up from #27823 (spkg-configure.m4 for iconv), comment 46:

  It seems that, at least on Cygwin, AM_ICONV will pass, somehow, even if iconv.h is installed, thus making the libicon-devel package on Cygwin a requirement, at least when it comes to building R (which otherwise fails at #include <iconv.h>).

  For now I'll just update the Cygwin build instructions to require libiconv-devel as a prerequisite which is preferable anyways. But maybe this still needs to be checked for somehow...

Indeed this needs fixing:

```
configure:21635: g++ -std=gnu++11 -o conftest.exe -g -O2    conftest.cpp -lglpk -lreadline -lcurl -lbz2 -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp -lm  -lntl -liconv >&5
conftest.cpp:68:10: fatal error: iconv.h: No such file or directory
   68 | #include <iconv.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
...

configure:21645: result: no, consider installing GNU libiconv
## ------------------------------------------------------ ##
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG iconv... ##
## ------------------------------------------------------ ##
configure:21940: will use system package and not install SPKG iconv
## ---------------------------------------------------- ##


```

note that spkg-install says 

```
    echo "iconv will be installed as the operating system is Cygwin, HP-UX or Solaris."
    echo "These systems either lack iconv, or do not have a sufficiently capable"
```

Is this no longer true for Cygwin?
