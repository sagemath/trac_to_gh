We run more stable test for polyhedra using `TestSuite`.

Bug fixes:

- #29836: normaliz backend isn't ready for generators 
- #29898: vertex facet graph for trivial polyhedra fails 
- #29899: Two bugs with dilation
- #29904: Broken double description of hypercube
- #30328: Need to convert values before passing them to `cdd`
- #30330: `cdd` backend fails to initialize empty polyhedron from double description
- #31820: Fix pickling of normaliz representation objects 

#29903: Run test suites for many examples. (All the following tickets depend on this one.)

Add new test methods:
- #29905: `_test_basic_properties`
- #29908`is_combinatorially_equivalent`,
- #29906: `an_affine_basis`,
- #29907: `dilation`,
- #29918: gale transform
- #29934: product
- #30293: lawrence construction
- #30292: pyramid
- #31821: Run the test suite of `self.combinatorial_polyhedron()`
- #31823: `a_maximal_chain`
- constructors and check such as `pyramid` -> `is_pyramid`
