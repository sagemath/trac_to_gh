From README.md:

  The Sage Library is GPLv2+, and included packages have [compatible OSS
licenses](./COPYING.txt). [Over 400 people](https://www.sagemath.org/development-map.html)
  have contributed code to Sage. In many cases, documentation for modules
  and functions list the authors.

In this ticket, we add an AUTHORS.md file, which will contain
this link too, and thus lead to the several more sources
where developers' contributions to Sage can be seen (including maintenance of spkgs - see #29636):

- Changelogs
- some Trac searches
- ...

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-general.html#who-is-behind-this-project also has similar links.
