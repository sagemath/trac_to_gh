This is strange because (a) I can't figure out what it has to do with matplotlib, and (b) tests only fail when run with `--long`, but the indicated tests are not marked `# long time`. The closest place there is a `# long time` tag is over 200 lines earlier.

I think we have a case where stuff may not be in matplotlib itself but some use of matplotlib may prime the memory for an error in another component to happen. In this case it is more a matter of highlighting a bug in that other component.

The strange bit that could be related to matplotlib is the use of freetype on the calls leading to the error. Is the stuff supposed to display something? If not why is it involved.

The commands from jhpalmieri don't give me an exception unless I do the last command twice (like in mine).

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: E389 = EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: EK = E389.change_ring(K)
sage: P = EK(-1,1); Q = EK(0,-1)
sage: EK.saturation([P+Q, 17*Q], lower_ht_bound=0.1)
([(4 : 8 : 1), (0 : -1 : 1)], 17, 0.152460177943143)
sage: E2 = EllipticCurve(K, [0,0,0,0,1])
sage: C = E2.isogeny_class()
sage: G = C.graph()
sage: G.show()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 9 graphics primitives
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: E.rational_points(bound=5)
[(0 : 1 : 0), (5 : 5 : 1)]
sage: E.rational_points(bound=5)
libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::runtime_error: Couldn't close file
```
PS `bound=3` gives me the same behavior as `bound=5`, but `bound=2` gives no error until I run it a third time.

```

Generally speaking, this patch doesn't affect functionality or behavior in sage. So, from the point of view of distros it is safe. It only deals with a corner case that is not just a sage problem.

Some Sage packages use `sage-system-python`, some use `sage-python23`. Some of the ones using `sage-system-python` are build before Python, which makes sense, but for packages like matplotlib, I don't see any reason to not use `sage-python23`.
