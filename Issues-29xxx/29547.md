This is strange because (a) I can't figure out what it has to do with matplotlib, and (b) tests only fail when run with `--long`, but the indicated tests are not marked `# long time`. The closest place there is a `# long time` tag is over 200 lines earlier.

I think we have a case where stuff may not be in matplotlib itself but some use of matplotlib may prime the memory for an error in another component to happen. In this case it is more a matter of highlighting a bug in that other component.

The strange bit that could be related to matplotlib is the use of freetype on the calls leading to the error. Is the stuff supposed to display something? If not why is it involved.
