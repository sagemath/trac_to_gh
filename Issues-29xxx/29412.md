Most of sage uses `cot` for the cotangent function `1/tan(x)`, but the classes `ComplexNumber` and `MPComplexNumber` have methods that are called `cotan`, instead. To eliminate a bug caused by this inconsistency, ticket #29409 renames these methods to `cot`. 

For backward compatibility, ticket #29409 defines `cotan` as an alias for `cot` in these two classes. This ticket deprecates those aliases.

FWIW, Maple uses `cot` and Mathematica uses `Cot`.

Depends on #29409

Keywords: **cotangent, complex**
