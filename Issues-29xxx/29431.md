This ticket implements the radius algorithm given in http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660

It performs very well

( >90% reduction in execution time on all graphs I tried)


```
: G = Graph(4)                           
....: while not G.is_connected():
....:     G = graphs.RandomGNP(10000,0.008)
....:     

sage: %time G.radius()
CPU times: user 23min 30s, sys: 4min 9s, total: 27min 39s
Wall time: 27min 39s
3

sage: %time G.radius(algorithm="radius-certificate")
CPU times: user 231 ms, sys: 4.38 ms, total: 236 ms
3
```


Keywords: graph, gsoc, radius
