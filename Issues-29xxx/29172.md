This part here is a little worrisome to me:

            else:

However, I don't see that as being guaranteed for multivariate polynomial rings. I get the idea of being faster by avoiding one extra coercion call, and I like it.

```
sage: Pa.<a> = ZZ[]
sage: L.<x> = Pa[]
sage: Pax = ZZ['a,x']
sage: p = a*x
sage: Pax(p)
a*x
sage: _.variables()
(a, x)

Thanks for having a look Travis.

There is no reason to be worried. `u` is univariate (the change happens in `class LaurentPolynomial_univariate`). Or maybe I misunderstood your remark.

Small thing, in the test above, it should be `L.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(Pa)`, but this is the conversion analog I expected.

I know `__u` is univariate, but I don't see why `u` must be. In particular, I am saying take a (Laurent) polynomial in **Z**[a][x] into the multivariate polynomial ring **Z**[a,x]. I believe this method will also be called for this, and if you take a polynomial `p` with coefficients in **Z**[a] that contains an `a`, then the variables of `p` will contain both `a` and `x`, and `a` will be `u.variables()[0]` in this case. Or is the method not called in this case? Does this particular test work?
