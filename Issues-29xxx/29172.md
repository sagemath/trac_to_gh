This part here is a little worrisome to me:

```
            if self.__u.degree():
                x = u.variables()[0]
            else:
                x = R(self.gen())
            return x**self.__n * u
```
when `__u` has positive degree, then it relies on the variables of `u` starting with the same one for the polynomial ring. However, I don't see that as being guaranteed for multivariate polynomial rings. I get the idea of being faster by avoiding one extra coercion call, and I like it. Yet, I don't see why this is guaranteed. I think you should include the test:

```
sage: Pa.<a> = ZZ[]
sage: L.<x> = Pa[]
sage: Pax = ZZ['a,x']
sage: p = a*x
sage: Pax(p)
a*x
sage: _.variables()
(a, x)
```

Thanks for having a look Travis.

There is no reason to be worried. `u` is univariate (the change happens in `class LaurentPolynomial_univariate`). Or maybe I misunderstood your remark.
