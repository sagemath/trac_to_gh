# Issue 29003: Install Sage-specific .pc files when running make, not configure

As noted in [this comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27870#comment:81), if we generate any .pc files at configure time, rather than write them directly to `$SAGE_LOCAL` it would be preferable to write them somewhere in the sage source tree instead, then copy them into the relevant install target (i.e. `$SAGE_LOCAL`) only when running `make`.

One tricky aspect to this is at least some SPGKs require our generated .pc files to be installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL` to build properly.  Currently, one way around that is to add `$(PCFILES)` to the package's dependencies.  This is needed at the very least for numpy.

A different workaround might be to modify `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to include .pc files in the source tree.  I have not tried that yet.

First attempt at this seems to work.

I chose `src/lib/pkgconfig` as the path for .pc files to install from the source tree, as it has a nice congruence with `src/bin`.  But that was just a minor preference--this path could be anywhere in the source tree, or even outside it (e.g. for VPATH builds, should we ever get that working...)

I think the approach in this version might be simplest, and is closer to the existing behavior.  The major difference now is that actually copying `.pc` files into `$SAGE_LOCAL` is deferred until `make` is run, rather than writing to `$SAGE_LOCAL` directly when running `configure`.
