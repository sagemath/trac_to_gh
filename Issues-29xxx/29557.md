For homebrew, do we want to recommend any of:
- autoconf
- automake
- ffmpeg
- imagemagick
- pandoc
?

A related question: if we recommend pandoc (for instance) for debian, then for consistency, should we necessarily recommend it for homebrew?

autoconf/automake are already in homebrew-bootstrap.txt

The other, yes.

Ideally, yes, but getting a version of this ticket merged would be good even if it has not reached 100% consistency between distributions
