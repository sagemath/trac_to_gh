Let's improve the installation-from-source documentation regarding the "recommended system packages" for 9.1.

- `build/pkgs/_recommended` - records additional recommended packages such as texlive-xetex (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/prerequisites/Ubuntu); also texinfo (from #22191)

(from #29124)

Related:

- #29146: Meta-ticket: Refactor and improve system package related scripts, tox.ini, build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh
- #29372: At the end of configure, show installation hints for disabled optional packages separately
- #30624: Improve configure's recommendation message

autoconf/automake are already in homebrew-bootstrap.txt

The other, yes.
