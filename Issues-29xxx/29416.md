This would create a copy of the worktree in the toxenvdir. Using `git worktree add --detached` + copying over `git ls-files --exclude-standard -m -o ` or similar.

This would be an alternative to #21469 (Enable VPATH builds (several independent build trees connected to one source tree))

Component: **porting**
