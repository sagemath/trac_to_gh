I think this is a very important point, and one that needs discussion in a broader context. 

1) Can the category system be used to add these tightened type annotations automatically?

2) In such situations, should the doctests be replaced or augmented by `_test_...` methods so that subclasses are tested properly.

No, one can take the differential because the returned object in this case is actually a `DiffMap`, which is also a `ContinuousMap` since `DiffMap` is a subclass of `ContinuousMap` (see the example below). 

>I'm not familiar with the category code, but maybe it can be improved so that the function `def hom_set: return Hom(self, self)` defined in class A, returns the correct homomrophisms for derived classes `B(A)` as well (so `b.hom_set` returns the hom set of `b` as an element of B).


No need for improvement, this is already the case:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M'); M
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: Id = M.identity_map()
sage: type(Id)
<class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.DifferentiableManifoldHomset_with_category.element_class'>
sage: isinstance(Id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
True
sage: isinstance(Id, sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap)
True
sage: Id.parent()
Set of Morphisms from 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M 
 to 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M in Category of 
 smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision

I'll have a look at the remaining issues after these false positives are fixed.

Finally, the `pyrightconfig.json` is the configuration file for `pyright`, which is static type checker. At the moment there are still to many type problems but in the long term this should be integrated in the build progress.

I think you can just do

```
from sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map import DiffMap
```

at the beginning of the doctest or

```
isinstance(id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
```

After building your modified sage, the doctest should pass with

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py
```

The doctest works almost like a mini sage session.

No it does not: the output type does no longer appear in the generated html documentation.

Moreover, what is the meaning of this change in `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/manifold.py`:

```diff
-    def metric(self, name, signature=None, latex_name=None, dest_map=None):
+    def metric(self, name=None, signature=None, latex_name=None, dest_map=None) -> PseudoRiemannianMetric:
```
i.e. why `name` is replaced by `name=None` ?

I'm currently working on a solution to show the typing information in the documentation using https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/ (in a new ticket of course).

Not sure why I changed the name to `None`. Probably I was "inspired" by the constructor of a generic tensor field:

```
def __init__(self, vector_field_module, tensor_type, name=None,
                 latex_name=None, sym=None, antisym=None, parent=None):
```
Does the name has to be set for a metric?

Yes for it is used to set the name of derived quantities (Levi-Civita connection, curvature tensor, etc.). Of course, this can be discussed and changed, but in another ticket, since this definitely does not pertain to the current ticket.

I tried to change the documentation to incorporate typing information, but this turns out to be a bit more complicated than expected.
So for now I've readded the class information in the documentation.

Moreover, I've removed the `name = None` for the metric again.

So it should be ready for review now.

And this change is an API change (= introduces a bug).

The argument `tensor_type` does NOT have `Tuple[int, int]` as its input type. It also accepts lists. It marshals the input to a tuple.

Your change removes the marshaling.

According to the documentation 
> - ``tensor_type`` -- pair `(k,l)` with `k` being the contravariant rank

      and `l` the covariant rank

which is quite clear about that it expects a 2-tuple. Thus, this change is only a formalization of the current public interface; I can of course revert it and adapt the documentation to point out that it also accepts arbitrary iterables if that's really desired. It feels however more consistent to represent the tensor type everywhere by a tuple.

I accidentally run a code formatter over these files and committed the changes; sorry for this. Will try not to do this again in the future.

Well, the code obviously was concerned about making it a tuple to provide a robust interface. 

> Thus, this change is only a formalization of the current public interface


No, this is not how Python typing works. You cannot rely on the type annotations for input checking/marshaling; this still has to be done by code. Type annotations are merely decoration for documentation purposes and static checkers.

But that's what the above code is doing (except for displaying a nicer error message in the case its null). What a type checker cannot infer is the "invariant of the internal representation" that `_immersed is true` implies that `_immersion is not null`. There are workarounds for such implications for type checkers but they are overkill in this situation.
