I think this is a very important point, and one that needs discussion in a broader context. 

1) Can the category system be used to add these tightened type annotations automatically?

2) In such situations, should the doctests be replaced or augmented by `_test_...` methods so that subclasses are tested properly.

No, one can take the differential because the returned object in this case is actually a `DiffMap`, which is also a `ContinuousMap` since `DiffMap` is a subclass of `ContinuousMap` (see the example below). 

>I'm not familiar with the category code, but maybe it can be improved so that the function `def hom_set: return Hom(self, self)` defined in class A, returns the correct homomrophisms for derived classes `B(A)` as well (so `b.hom_set` returns the hom set of `b` as an element of B).


No need for improvement, this is already the case:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M'); M
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: Id = M.identity_map()
sage: type(Id)
<class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.DifferentiableManifoldHomset_with_category.element_class'>
sage: isinstance(Id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
True
sage: isinstance(Id, sage.manifolds.continuous_map.ContinuousMap)
True
sage: Id.parent()
Set of Morphisms from 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M 
 to 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M in Category of 
 smooth manifolds over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

I'll have a look at the remaining issues after these false positives are fixed.

Finally, the `pyrightconfig.json` is the configuration file for `pyright`, which is static type checker. At the moment there are still to many type problems but in the long term this should be integrated in the build progress.

Could you create a separate ticket for this please and link to it from #28936

<a id='comment:26'></a>I think you can just do

```
from sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map import DiffMap
```

at the beginning of the doctest or

```
isinstance(id, sage.manifolds.differentiable.diff_map.DiffMap)
```

After building your modified sage, the doctest should pass with

```
sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py
```

No it does not: the output type does no longer appear in the generated html documentation.

Moreover, what is the meaning of this change in `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/manifold.py`:

```diff
-    def metric(self, name, signature=None, latex_name=None, dest_map=None):
+    def metric(self, name=None, signature=None, latex_name=None, dest_map=None) -> PseudoRiemannianMetric:
```
i.e. why `name` is replaced by `name=None` ?

Not sure why I changed the name to `None`. Probably I was "inspired" by the constructor of a generic tensor field:

```
def __init__(self, vector_field_module, tensor_type, name=None,
                 latex_name=None, sym=None, antisym=None, parent=None):

Yes for it is used to set the name of derived quantities (Levi-Civita connection, curvature tensor, etc.). Of course, this can be discussed and changed, but in another ticket, since this definitely does not pertain to the current ticket.

Moreover, I've removed the `name = None` for the metric again.

According to the documentation 
> - ``tensor_type`` -- pair `(k,l)` with `k` being the contravariant rank

      and `l` the covariant rank

which is quite clear about that it expects a 2-tuple. Thus, this change is only a formalization of the current public interface; I can of course revert it and adapt the documentation to point out that it also accepts arbitrary iterables if that's really desired. It feels however more consistent to represent the tensor type everywhere by a tuple.

But that's what the above code is doing (except for displaying a nicer error message in the case its null). What a type checker cannot infer is the "invariant of the internal representation" that `_immersed is true` implies that `_immersion is not null`. There are workarounds for such implications for type checkers but they are overkill in this situation.
