Vanilla GLPK 4.65 frequently prints a warning message "Long-step dual simplex will be used". Sage patches its GLPK to skip this, and some distros use a patched GLPK as well, but not all of them. For the systems where there is only an unpatched GLPK, we should ignore this warning message in doctesting.

Works well for me. Setting this to positive review even though I would personally prefer to reject unpatched glpk distro packages.

By the way, I see (with and without the ticket):

```
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx", line 2287, in sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend.print_ranges
Failed example:
    p.print_ranges()
Expected:
    glp_print_ranges: optimal basic solution required
    1
Got:
    1
```

this is perhaps one more message to add to ignoring list.
Probably due to glpk not built with GMP support, IIRC.
