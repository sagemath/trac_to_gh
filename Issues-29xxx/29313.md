Since Sage can now use system pari, perhaps 2.11.3 should be blacklisted until this is merged. Ideally, distros shipping 2.11.3 should backport the patch as it is quite a serious bug.

Yes, they forgot to backport the fix to stable. See [1]

You have some examples in [1] and [2]

This causes a few failures in Sage. Among other things, simon's scripts are totally broken.

When patching pari with [1] and sage with [2] I still get at least one doctest failure (I only tested the number_fields.py file for now):

That's one of the failures that should be fixed with pari's patch, are you sure you're running the patched version?
