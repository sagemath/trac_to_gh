# Issue 29960: list_plot plots y-values on x-axis when a value is None

The error handling in `list_plot` is dubious, with the following incredible side effect:

```
list_plot([(0,-1),(1,-2),(2,-3),(3,-4),(4,None)])
```

![](list_plot_x-axis.png)

What happens is that `list_plot` eventually calls `point` which raises a `TypeError` due to the `None`, and then `list_plot` assumes that it was because the input consists of complex numbers (which is not the reason), and further it assumes that the input `data` has already been replaced by `list(enumerate(data))` by the previous code (which isn't the case), so it takes the second entry of each pair and converts it into an element of `CC` and plots that. Hence the y-values are plotted on the x-axis. (And the `None` is converted to `0`.)

**Keywords:** list_plot, None
