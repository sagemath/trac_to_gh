... such as homebrew's NTL (#29104).

Builds with NTL_THREADS breaks Singular (as observed in #29104).

In fact, as of the NTL upgrade ticket #20590, we build the NTL SPKG with NTL_THREADS=off. (On that ticket, it was noted "we cannot take advantage of the threading until a number of things are resolved. Threading requires C++11 and a number of packages are behind the curve.")

In a follow-up ticket we may consider issuing a warning if NTL is configured without NTL_GMP_LIP, without NTL_GF2X_LIB, which may lead to a performance degradation.

This means that TLS is enabled for pari/gp.
