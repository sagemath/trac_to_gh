See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/gPCIAtImrVo/lcxh_HyiEQAJ):

```
sage: type(unit_step(x).operator()) 
<class 'sage.functions.generalized.FunctionUnitStep'> 
sage: type(unit_step(x)._sympy_()._sage_().operator()) 
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'> 
```

This may also fix the observed problem in that thread, if not we will need another ticket for that.

Needs doctest and possibly also mentioning current behavior of the example in the thread, which I quote, assuming it is correct:

```

#In previous versions of Sage the answer, in the case piecewise functions like  f*g,   could employ the functions like sign()  or abs(),  but  no Error messages appeared 

#The following alternative raises no Error, but does not evaluate the f*g function to  t^2/2-t+1/2, as desired:
var('x,t')
assume(1<t)
f=unit_step(t-1)
g=t
fg = integrate(f(t=x)*g(t=t-x),x,0,t,hold=False)
show(fg)
forget()

#In previous versions of Sage the answer, in the case piecewise functions like  f*g,   could employ the functions like sign()  or abs(),  but  no Error messages appeared 

#The following alternative raises no Error, but does not evaluate the f*g function to  t^2/2-t+1/2, as desired:
var('x,t')
assume(1<t)
f=unit_step(t-1)
g=t
fg = integrate(f(t=x)*g(t=t-x),x,0,t,hold=False)
