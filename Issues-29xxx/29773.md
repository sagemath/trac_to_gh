This PR removes a few future imports. These are obsolete with Python 3.7. See https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#future-statements. There are quite a few more of these future imports, which I can remove if you would like.

Moreover, sometimes an error message occurred because the `DeprecationWarning` wasn't an element of the `warnings.filters` list. Thus, I added an check for existence before removing it.
