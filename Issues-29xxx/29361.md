This line (introduced in #29071):

```
        AC_FC_FREEFORM([AC_FC_FUNC([dgeqrf])])
```
is not executed at all because `AC_FC_FREEFORM` is `AC_DEFUN_ONCE` and is called already in `gfortran/spkg-configure.m4`

As a result:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG openblas...
checking BLAS library... openblas
checking whether any of gfortran is installed or will be installed as SPKG... no
checking for openblas >= 0.2.20... yes
checking for cblas_dgemm... yes
checking for ... no
checking for lapack... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG openblas
```

In this ticket, we fix the check by avoiding `AC_FC_FUNC` altogether, which is not suitable to be used in a configure that must work if no Fortran compiler is available.

(Factored out from #29104.)

I do get an error running bootstrap though, but probably not from this ticket.

it cannot find openblas, as Fedora does not install openblas.pc

it is out of scope of this ticket. 

It is possible to get around this by either shipping or generating one, though.
