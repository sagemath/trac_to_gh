```
This line (introduced in #29071):

```
        AC_FC_FREEFORM([AC_FC_FUNC([dgeqrf])])
```
is not executed at all because `AC_FC_FREEFORM` is `AC_DEFUN_ONCE` and is called already in `gfortran/spkg-configure.m4`

As a result:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG openblas...
checking BLAS library... openblas
checking whether any of gfortran is installed or will be installed as SPKG... no
checking for openblas >= 0.2.20... yes
checking for cblas_dgemm... yes
checking for ... no
checking for lapack... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG openblas
```

In this ticket, we fix the check by avoiding `AC_FC_FUNC` altogether, which is not suitable to be used in a configure that must work if no Fortran compiler is available.

(Factored out from #29104.)
