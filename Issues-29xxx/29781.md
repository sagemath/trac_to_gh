with a recent Boost (1.73 on Gentoo) I see doctest errors like

```
File "src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx", line 915, in sage.graphs.base.boost_graph.shortest_paths
Failed example:
    shortest_paths(g, 1, algorithm='Dijkstra')
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Dijkstra algorithm does not work with negative weights, use Bellman-Ford instead
Got:
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::wrapexcept<boost::negative_edge>'
      what():  The graph may not contain an edge with negative weight.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 680, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1104, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.graphs.base.boost_graph.shortest_paths[13]>", line 1, in <module>
        shortest_paths(g, Integer(1), algorithm='Dijkstra')
      File "sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx", line 827, in sage.graphs.base.boost_graph.shortest_paths (build/cythonized/sage/graphs
/base/boost_graph.cpp:12063)
        cpdef shortest_paths(g, start, weight_function=None, algorithm=None):

        sig_on()
    RuntimeError: Aborted
```
we fix these by using proper try/catch block.

LGTM.

I added a note in #29657 since the usage of weights must be strengthen in `boost_graph.pyx` and unified with other weighted methods.
