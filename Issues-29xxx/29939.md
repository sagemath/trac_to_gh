We decided to fix the underlying sign error in #29936. So this is a duplicate.

---

In `src/sage/geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py`, four doctests claim to be precise up to `1e-9` for random geodesics.

Unfortunately, this assumes `set_random_seed(0)` and the claim fails by far for many "random" values. In #29936 we specified the precision for which this does hold, which is not much. This should be fixed.
