This ticket is created to establish a concise and efficient inheritance structure between sections of vector bundles and tensor fields in order to avoid or reduce code redundancies.

In this ticket, we restrict the modification to tensor fields only. The issue "vectorframes -> local frames" is devoted to another ticket (opening soon).

I guess, a first way to start would be to let `TensorField` inherit from `Section` since the most common code snipptes are hidden there. Then we can try to use a pattern like

```python
def overloaded_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
    r"""
    Keep documentation and docstring
    """
    return super().overloaded_method(args, kwargs)
```

to keep the documentation.

Alternatively one could think about another documentation page functioning as a compendium for these kind of things.

I'd prefer the former option because this is easier for users who are not involved in the development process to follow the changes, meaning things are kept as known for them.

This is code duplication and should be avoided IMHO. 
Why not pasting the current doctests in `TensorField` to the `EXAMPLES` section of the method implemented at the section level? In this way, the end user will still discover these examples with the `?` key.
