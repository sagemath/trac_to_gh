Lets consider following code

```
t, u = var('t,u')
f = u^2 + (t^3 + t^2 + 1)*u - t^2 - t
f = f.subs(u=u -1/2*(t^3 + t^2 + 1))
```

and lets try to get coefficient near `u` which should be zero after substitution:

```
f.coefficient(u, 1)
# => t^3 + t^2 + 1
```

There is no reason why it should be the return of `coefficient`.

Whereas if you `collect` before call `coefficient` it works as expected:

```
f.collect(u).coefficient(u, 1)
# => 0
```

Component: **symbolics**

Keywords: **coefficient, collect, symbolic ring**

One sentence in the docstring for `f.coefficient` says:

```
Sometimes it may be necessary to expand or factor first, since this
is not done automatically.
```
Therefore, the function seems to be behaving as described, so I think this is enhancement request, rather than a bug.
