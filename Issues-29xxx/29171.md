<a id='comment:3'></a>Thank you.
The doc you want for a giac keyword (Ex: gbasis) is avaible like this:

```
sage: from sage.libs.giac.giac import *
sage: libgiac.gbasis._help()
sage: libgiac.gbasis._sage_doc_()
```
Indeed 
`libgiac.gbasis?` doesn't give the good help string. 
NB: you removed the def help(self):
so now libgiac.gbasis.help()   crashes. You should also remove the property help or use _help in it.

No I think it this situation where giacpy_sage is not a package anymore it is not important to keep backward comptatibility. I think here it is better to just drop the giacpy_sage setup.py and let sage build it via the entry in module.py as vincent did in this branch.

OK, I have rebased it, dropping the merge of the upgrade ticket #29552.

This seems to work.

<a id='comment:41'></a>Can we import the  libgiac function from sage/libs/all.py such that it is avaiable in a similar way as libgap?
the problem if I add `lazy_import('sage.libs.giac.giac', 'libgiac')`
is that the first time one type libgiac(2) the user might be confused by the loading message of the giac library:

```
sage: libgiac(2)

is it better to not use lazy_import or to force the loading at startup  or just keep this message during the first use of libgiac?

Yes, this is a good idea - it would match `libgap` and `maxima_calculus`, which are available too.

That's not a big problem.

Perhaps open an issue with upstream to reduce verbosity in library mode?

There's something wrong with our installation, as mentioned in #29552

> is it better to not use lazy_import or to force the loading at startup 


No, definitely not. We don't want to load it at startup.

about the message
`Help file /Applications/usr/share/giac/doc/en/aide_cas not found`
I don't think that it is a broken installation. This text file have a builtin version in the library. I think it is only usefull if you want to overide the builtin version without recompiling giac.
Ex: if in icas I do `?smith` I have the same information as in share/giac/doc/aide_cas

Looks great.

Thanks for the information. It's just that it looks like an error message, and moreover the path (`/Applications/usr...`) is really strange and is unrelated to the actual installation location of giac in sage.

Perhaps upstream could add a way to suppress these messages?
