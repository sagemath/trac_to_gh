While trying to fix things on https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/algebra I noticed the following problem if one doesn't have PHC installed:

```
sage: print(os.system('which phc') + '  PHC needs to be installed and in your path')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-f9a470112020> in <module>()
----> 1 print(os.system('which phc') + '  PHC needs to be installed and in your path')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
sage: os.system('which phc') 
256
```
This is from https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/interfaces/phc.py#L939 

```
        if e:
            from sage.misc.sage_ostools import have_program
            if not have_program('phc'):
                print(os.system('which phc') + '  PHC needs to be installed and in your path')
                raise RuntimeError
            # todo -- why? etc.
            with open(log_filename) as f:
                msg = f.read()
            raise RuntimeError(msg + "\nError running phc.")
```
But it is never tested because all the optional tests are, well, optional!  Anyway, the fix should be pretty easy, make it a string - presumably something left over from the py3 switch.

But we should also *test* this, somehow.  How do you test for when a package is *not* installed?

Hilarious!  I probably saw that email and said, "I don't know anything about PHC" and ignored it ... please accept my apologies, and thanks for fixing it!

Though my comment about testing still stands ... is there some ticket open about testing for the *non*-presence of a package?  This is a desideratum.  I can open one if you don't know of one.
