Sometimes it is useful to obtain `dim + 1` vertices of a polytope in general position -- an affine basis.

With #29117, which provides a maximal chain of faces, we can easily obtain those vertices that are even guaranteed to be in general position for any realization of the polytope.

We apply this affine basis to simplify `is_inscribed`. This is also faster, as the current approach requires to compute all neighbors of a vertex (which can be pretty hard, even once this is done efficiently through combinatorial polyhedron):

Time without this ticket:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(8)
sage: %time P.is_inscribed()
CPU times: user 17.5 s, sys: 32.4 ms, total: 17.5 s
Wall time: 17.5 s
True
```
Time with this ticket:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(8)
sage: %time P.is_inscribed()
CPU times: user 17.5 ms, sys: 10 µs, total: 17.5 ms
Wall time: 17.4 ms
True
```

While we are at it, we fix a bug for the empty polyhedron, so that `a_maximal_chain` returns just a list of one empty face, instead of two.

Follow ups:

- We use this to fix #29116.
- We implement `is_affinely_isomorphic`.

Since you also implemented an_affine_basis for Polyhedron, maybe it is better to use it.
Doing so, you can remove the following part of your code and thus making the code easier to read.
I am saying this because if you use an_affine_basis for Polyhedron, you will have the whole polyhedron as a face.

```
        # Finally append some vertex not contained in ``face``,
        # which is a facet of ``self`` now.
        for i in range(len(face)):
            if face[i] != i:

                break
        else:  # no break
