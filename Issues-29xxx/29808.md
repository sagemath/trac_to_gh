As observed in #29553, permutations incorrectly act on matrices via a left action on the rows when multiplying on the right. This ticket fixes the left action to act on the left, and also adds the missing right action on the columns.

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: p, q = S('(1,2,3,4,5,6)'), S('(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)')
sage: M = matrix.diagonal([1..6])
sage: (M * p.matrix()) * q.matrix() == M * (p.matrix() * q.matrix())  # correct
True
sage: (M * p) * q == M * (p * q)  # should be True
False
```
