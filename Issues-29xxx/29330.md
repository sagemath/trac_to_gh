There exists a functionality to check for hermitian matrices with 
`is_hermitian()` which returns `True` or `False`. Can we add the functionality to check whether a matrix is skew hermitian, with `is_skew_hermitian()`?

Perhaps a more knowledgeable sage developer will say differently, but, to avoid code redundancy, I would suggest modifying the definition of `is_hermitian` to define a private method `_is_hermitian(self, skew)`, so that `is_hermitian(self)` can be defined as `_is_hermitian(self, False)` and `is_skew_hermitian` can be defined as `_is_hermitian(self, True)`.

As suggested, I have added a private method `_is_hermitian` which accepts a flag `skew` to check whether the matrix is (skew-)Hermitian, following the conventions from Matlab:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ishermitian.html

The private method is then dispatched by the public functions `is_hermitian` and `is_skew_hermitian`.
