`is_hermitian()` which returns `True` or `False`. Can we add the functionality to check whether a matrix is skew hermitian, with `is_skew_hermitian()`?

As suggested, I have added a private method `_is_hermitian` which accepts a flag `skew` to check whether the matrix is (skew-)Hermitian, following the conventions from Matlab:

https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ishermitian.html

The private method is then dispatched by the public functions `is_hermitian` and `is_skew_hermitian`.
