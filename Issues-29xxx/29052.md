This is part of #21707 - "Split `sage-env` into 5". 

We set up a new `configure`-generated, to-be-`source`d shell script `build/bin/sage-build-env-config` to which we move environment variable settings from `src/bin/sage-env[-config]` that are only needed for:

1. Sage-the-distribution while building spkgs,
2. Sage-the-distribution for building sagelib.

The new script is used in addition to `src/bin/sage-env` in these two contexts.

We add a command `sage --buildsh`, like `sage --sh` but using the larger environment.

---

Follow-up: 
- `build/make/install` contains more environment settings that should be reviewed for moving to `sage-build-env-config`
