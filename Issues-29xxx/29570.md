```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.diff_form(0).parent()
Free module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

This output is obviously wrong. The parent should represent the algebra of scalar fields instead. However, the element is correct:


```
sage: M.diff_form(0)
Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


While seeking the origin, I have encountered an issue even worse:

```
from sage.tensor.modules.finite_rank_free_module import FiniteRankFreeModule

sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: M.alternating_form(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'element_class'
```

This should be fixed with this ticket.

I agree, your suggestions sounds much better. Do arbitrary rings such as `ZZ` even provide constructors for generic elements?

However, in the first place, this issue occured due to the line

```
         return self.dual_exterior_power(degree).element_class(self, degree,
                                               name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
```

where `self` is definitely not the parent of the ring element. I would say, this is highly unstable since we cannot predict which arguments the element class actually takes and needs (for degree > 0 this is fine since we know which elements we deal with).

Indeed! Maybe an explicit scalar field construction (inside a try block) like you did for the non-free case is preferable then:

```
try:
    return self._domain.scalar_field(name=name, latex_name=latex_name)

Thinking about it, what about having the `except AttributeError` block do `raise NotImplementedError`? Sounds better than returning a random element...

Something like this?

I feel uncomfortable to add the special case of scalar fields to the most general case of modules over arbitrary ring. For that reason, I added this particular case to the vector field module.

Sounds better indeed.
Probably 

```
return self._ring.element_class(self, name=name,
                                latex_name=latex_name)
```
must be replaced by

```
return self._ring.element_class(self._ring, name=name,
                                latex_name=latex_name)
```
Then, do you really need to redefine `alternating_form` in `VectorFieldFreeModule`?
