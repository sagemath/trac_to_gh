A few comments:

This is a bit faster and `int` is immutable:

```diff
-return self([0 for i in range(self.ngens())])
+return self([0]*self.ngens())
```

I don't think the `list` is needed here:

```diff
-Jp = J.apply_map( lambda f: f.subs(dict(zip(gens, list(p)))) )
+Jp = J.apply_map( lambda f: f.subs(dict(zip(gens, p))) )
```

This is a little cleaner IMO:

```diff
-I.append(poly.subs(dict([x, x - c] for x, c in zip(gens, list(p)))))
+I.append(poly.subs({x: x - c for x, c in zip(gens, p)}))
```

This is not future-proof (if `i` gets made so it remains local to the for-loop):

```diff
         for i in range(len(p)):
             if p[i]:
-                break
-
-        C = self.affine_patch(i)
-        q = p.dehomogenize(i)
-        T = C.tangent_line(q)
-
-        return T.projective_closure(i, self.ambient_space())
+                C = self.affine_patch(i)
+                q = p.dehomogenize(i)
+                T = C.tangent_line(q)
+                return T.projective_closure(i, self.ambient_space())
+
+        n = len(p)
+        C = self.affine_patch(n)
+        q = p.dehomogenize(n)
+        T = C.tangent_line(q)
+        return T.projective_closure(n, self.ambient_space())
```
I am not sure this last part makes sense (I am pretty sure it does not), but the code path could in principle reach here before. Maybe it should raise an error in that case?

Done.

Done.

Done.

Right. There is no rational point with all zero homogeneous coordinates. It is now modified to raise a `TypeError` if somehow the part is reached.
