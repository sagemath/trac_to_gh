Conway and Sloane's formalism to compute the mass starts with their genus symbol. 
Currently the quadratic forms code does this in a detour. 

This ticket moves this functionality to the genus class where it really belongs. As a further advantage this allows to compute the mass of a genus without computing a representative first.
