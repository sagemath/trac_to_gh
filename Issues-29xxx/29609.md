Conway and Sloane's formalism to compute the mass starts with their genus symbol. 
Currently the quadratic forms code does this in a detour. 

This ticket moves this functionality to the genus class where it really belongs. As a further advantage this allows to compute the mass of a genus without computing a representative first.

**Branch/Commit:** [9b1bb8fbfddb6faf1f7b74c85ecdc1d305e37df3](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/9b1bb8fbfddb6faf1f7b74c85ecdc1d305e37df3)

**Reviewer:** Frédéric Chapoton

**Author:** Simon Brandhorst

**Resolution:** fixed
