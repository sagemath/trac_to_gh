This ticket migrates the methods `is_lawrence_polytope` and `is_pyramid` from `Polyhedron_base` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

Also, we change the output for the `0`-dimensional polyhedron. It is a pyramid over the empty polyhedron, even if it is not constructable in sage.

Along the way we fix a small bug, where the trivial combinatorial polyhedron in dimension 0 was set up without vertices (and facets). The bug fix is tested by `CombinatorialPolyhedron(0).is_pyramid(certificate=True)`.

What is the proper output to `polytopes.simplex(0).is_pyramid()`?

You cannot construct it as pyramid over one of its faces, because the empty face doesn't have a center.

I suggest the output to be `True` in this case. It does not need to be constructable in sage.
