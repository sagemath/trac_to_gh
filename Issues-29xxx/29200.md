Currently the dilation of a polyhedron is done by computing the new double description from the new vertices.

With #28880 at hand, we can specify both Vrep and Hrep and the backend will use both (if available) or the shorter description. Either way, this will improve performance of polyhedra with many vertices but few facets (e.g. a hypercube).

Before this ticket we had the following timings:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(14)
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 2.77 s, sys: 19.8 ms, total: 2.79 s
Wall time: 2.79 s
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(7, backend='field')
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 3.58 s, sys: 35 µs, total: 3.58 s
Wall time: 3.58 s
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(8, backend='field')
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 15.5 s, sys: 23.9 ms, total: 15.6 s
Wall time: 15.6 s
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(13)
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 395 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 395 ms
Wall time: 394 ms
```

With this ticket we have:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(14)
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 589 ms, sys: 6 µs, total: 589 ms
Wall time: 588 ms
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(7, backend='field')
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 14.1 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 14.1 ms
Wall time: 14.1 ms
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(8, backend='field')
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 49.2 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 49.2 ms
Wall time: 48.3 ms
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(13)
sage: %time _ = 2*P
CPU times: user 428 ms, sys: 8.08 ms, total: 436 ms
Wall time: 436 ms
```

Note that for the last timing, the choice of only specifying Vrep was already good (at least for backend `ppl`). So with the new setup, thinks take a bit more time, as `dilation` computes the new Hrep, which `ppl` discards then.
