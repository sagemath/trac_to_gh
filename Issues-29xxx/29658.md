By the way, to update sage_brial, I updated the version number in `package_version.txt` and ran `sage --package fix-checksum`, and was told

```
Updating checksum of brial-1.2.8.tar.bz2

Should it use the package name instead of the tarball name, or perhaps both? I find it a little misleading.

Well, it is updating what it sees in `checksum.ini` which is `brial` in this case. If we want say the "package name" corresponding to the tarball that's some extra code for `fix-checksum`.

And I am not touching sage's own packaging system anymore.
