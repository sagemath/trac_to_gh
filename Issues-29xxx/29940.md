<a id='comment:3'></a>This `for` loop is now redundant:

```
        for o in ("all",):
            if o in opt:
                raise ValueError("You cannot run gdb/valgrind on the whole sage%s library"%("" if o == "all" else "nb"))
```
and the error message is no longer needs the choice.
Other than that LGTM.
