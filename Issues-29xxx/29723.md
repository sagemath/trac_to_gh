Ticket #9792 implements `inverse_image` and `is_injective` for polynomial ring homomorphisms. Based on that, this ticket implements the methods

- `inverse`
- `is_invertible`
- `is_surjective`

This works for morphisms of polynomial rings, quotient rings, number fields and Galois fields. Several classes of ring homomorphisms are covered.

Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: sigma = R.hom([x - 2*y*(z*x+y^2) - z*(z*x+y^2)^2, y + z*(z*x+y^2), z], R)
sage: tau = sigma.inverse(); tau
Ring endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
  Defn: x |--> -y^4*z - 2*x*y^2*z^2 - x^2*z^3 + 2*y^3 + 2*x*y*z + x
        y |--> -y^2*z - x*z^2 + y
        z |--> z
sage: (tau * sigma).is_identity()
True
```

See #9792 for more details.


Depends on #9792

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

It turns out to be more convenient to implement `inverse_image` first, so this branch is now based on #9792 (kernel and inverse_image of (polynomial) ring homomorphisms).

I would appreciate if someone could give these tickets a review.
