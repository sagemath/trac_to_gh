This is for a cleaner, filtered structure of our Python modules, at least regarding their load time.  This is preparation for #29865 (`sage-objects`).

The idea is that `sage.categories` should be more abstract than any of the implemented algebraic structures in `sage.rings`, `sage.algebras`, `sage.modules`, ... Therefore it should only have a (module load time) dependence on `sage.structure` and `sage.misc`.

The present ticket changes module-level imports to method-level imports so that they are resolved later than at module load time.

At run time, of course, there are additional dependencies. For example, as noted in #29705, the output of `.cardinality()` must be an integer (ZZ).

Also, obviously the doctests need a larger part of the library.
