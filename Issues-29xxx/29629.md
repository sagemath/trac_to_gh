<div id="comment:13" align="right">comment:13</div>

Looks good overall.

A big question:

There seems to be a lot of code in `OrePolynomial` that I would think would be the in the generic univariate (dense) polynomial code from `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial`. Is there a reason you are not inheriting from that? Perhaps we also discussed this previously?

Some comments:

I imagine the change

```
SkewPolynomialRing = OrePolynomialRing
```
is because skew polynomials are ore polynomials in univariate case, correct? Will these concepts diverge in the multivariate case? If so, a comment would be good.

Shouldn't the ABC `degree` raise an `NotImplementedError`?

The leading coefficient of the 0 polynomial is 0 for other polynomial rings:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R.zero().leading_coefficient()
0
```
instead of raising an error. This would also simplify the `is_monic` implementation.

Error messages should not end with periods/full-stops (e.g., `is_unit`).

Style thing, but I think this is more simple:

```diff
-        _,r = self.right_quo_rem(other)
-        return r
+        return self.right_quo_rem(other)[1]
```

There is a global instance of `_Fields = Fields()` in `ring/ring.pyx`, which the check for `X in _Fields` is faster than `X in Fields` (last time I checked).

In `right/left_xlcm`, the math equation should have a period/full-stop at the end.

I feel like the lcm with one of the polynomials being `0` should be `0`. This would match the Sage integers:

```
sage: lcm(0, 5)
0
```
However, if you think the current way is the most reasonable, then feel free to ignore.

```diff
-        - ``monic`` -- boolean (default: ``True``). Return whether the left lcm
-          should be normalized to be monic.
+        - ``monic`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); return whether the left lcm
+          should be normalized to be monic
```
and similar.

I would instead put the code for checking if the polynomial is zero in `__nonzero__` instead of `is_zero` as Sage code is more likely to ducktype and check `if X:` than `if not X.is_zero():`. However, this is a very weak opinion.

Why this

```
import sage
```
in `ore_polynomial_ring.py`?

You should put `UniqueRepresentation` first in the MRO for `OrePolynomialRing`; that way there is less lookup for equality/hash/etc. (and less of a chance of it getting accidentally overwritten).

For the `OrePolynomialRing` doc, something you might find useful is the `.. RUBRIC:: A title`. See, e.g., `combinat/root_system/root_system.py` for an example.

Instead of `\FF_{x}`, do you mean `\GF{x}`?

```diff
-    `sigma` and a twisting `sigma`-derivation can be created as well as
+    `\sigma` and a twisting `\sigma`-derivation can be created as well as
```

Hum, I don't know. Actually, I just copied this code from the former class `SkewPolynomialRing`, which was designed a very long time ago.
However, I think that there are good reasons for separating Ore polynomials and polynomials, e.g. we probably don't want `isinstance(P, Polynomial)` to return true when `P` is a Ore polynomial as I expect many functions to implicitely interpret an instance of `Polynomial` as a commutative polynomial.

I think that the two locutions are synonymous in all cases; but there are used by different people (and maybe "skew polynomials" is preferred when the twisting derivation is trivial, whereas "Ore polynomials" is preferred otherwise).

I agree and changed this.
But this modifies the former interface of `leading_coefficient`. Should we add a deprecation somewhere?

With polynomials, computing lcm with `0` raises an error:

```
sage: A.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: P = A(0)
sage: P.lcm(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: inverse of Mod(0, 5) does not exist
```

> Why this
>

This is used on line 384:

```
        if self.Element is None:
            self.Element = sage.rings.polynomial.ore_polynomial_element.OrePolynomial_generic_dense
```
and in several other places

Then the common functionality should be separated out into a common ABC. Although a normal polynomial is just a skew polynomial under the identity map, correct? If so, the `Polynomial` class should inherit from the (abstract) `SkewPolynomial`.

I would be surprised if someone was relying on this behavior. It would also be very difficult to decrement, and I might even argue it was a bug before (so it does not need a deprecation).

Then I think you should do a more localized import, so

```python
from sage.rings.polynomial.ore_polynomial_element import OrePolynomial_generic_dense
```
at the module level (or in the corresponding methods if there happens to be some import cycle, but there shouldn't be...). This feels weird and like it could lead to some import problem (or requires some large import). I always prefer as localized as possible imports though.

I might be seduced by this idea... but I'm not completely sure it will be approved by all.

In any case, I think that it touches a lot in Sage and we cannot implement this in this ticket. So, I propose to delay this discussion to another ticket (and/or maybe collect opinions about this on sage-devel).

It should be fairly minimal as all it would do is add an additional class to the polynomial hierarchy, and just moving most (all?) of the methods up to that level. As far as anyone using the `Polynomial` class, they shouldn't see any difference/changes.

However, since this ticket is mostly moving code that was already there, we can delay it for another ticket.
