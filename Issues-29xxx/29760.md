Is there any reason *not* to implement the following?

```
sage: prime_range(11, 100, 10)
[11, 31, 61, 71]
```
For this ticket, I have in mind the easy fix of running the same internal algorithm and retaining only the answers in the desired congruence class; that is, `prime_range(x, y, z)` would be equivalent to

```
[p for p in prime_range(x, y) if (p-x)%z == 0]
```
A more advanced (and more efficient) version would be to change the underlying algorithm.
