Using version 9.1 of sage, the function _set_from_list_both(), implemented in: /sage/src/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_element.pyx, crashes or returns wrong results for some inputs.

Example for wrong results:

```
sage: T.<a> = Qp(5).extension(x^2-5)
sage: W.<w> = Qp(5).extension(x^2-5)
sage: W(a^-41)
O(w^-1)
```
Example for a crash (full output is availabale in the attached file):

```
sage: T.<a> = Qp(5).extension(x^2-5)
sage: T([5^-2], absprec=-1)

```

The bug occurs because the element is set to the desirable absolute precision **before** it is shifted by p<sup>min_val</sup>. 

To fix this, I subtracted (min_val * ramification-index) from the absolute precision to which the element is set, so that **after** shifting it will hopefully reach the desirable precision.

However, this does not completely solve the problem, because in case p is not a power of the uniformizer, shifting doesn't necessarily increase the absolute precision by exactly (min_val * ramification-index). So perhaps it would be best to set the absolute precision to the desirable value, only **after** the shifting (I didn't figure out how to do this correctly).

However, if it isn't necessary to have the exact desirable precision, the above solution could be enough.

The issue of shifting after setting the precision, is also relevant to _set_from_list_abs(), which I changed similarly.

Note: The first example given in this ticket requires fixing not only this bug, but also tickets #29925, #29926. After those bugs are all fixed, we get the result: w<sup>-41</sup> + O(w<sup>-2</sup>).

True. It's been a while since I looked at this. But isn't it at most off by one?

Is this correct when `min_val` is positive?

```
self._set_from_ZZ_pX_abs(&(<ntl_ZZ_pX>ntl_ZZ_pX(L, ctx)).x, ctx, absprec - (min_val * self.parent().e()))
```

When `min_val` is large, wouldn't x be 0 modulo the precision then?

It seems to me that you have to do the shift (probably depending on the sign of `min_val`) and then reduce the precision to `absprec` explicitly again for this to be really correct. Is that what you tried originally? Feel free to ask on Zulip if you are not sure how to do this.

Hi Julian, thank you for the review! 

* I have added the first example as you suggested.
* Regarding the question of the increase in the absolute-precision when shifting by p<sup>min_val</sup> : 
  Rethinking about the subject, it seems to me that perhaps the absolute-precision is actually increased by exactly (min_val * ramification-index). 
  Here is a proof (if anything in the process is wrong, I will appreciate any corrections!):
Denote the original number by x, the uniformizer by u, the ramification index by e, and min_val by n.
1. The valuation of p always equals e. Therefore the valuation of p<sup>n</sup> is e*n. 
   Denote: p<sup>n</sup> = a0*(u<sup>e*n</sup>) + a1*(u<sup>e*n+1</sup>) + a2*(u<sup>e*n+2</sup>) +...
2. x*p<sup>n</sup> = (x*a0*(u<sup>e*n</sup>)) + (x*a1*(u<sup>e*n+1</sup>)) + (x*a2*(u<sup>e*n+2</sup>)) +... 
3. The absolute-precision of x*p<sup>n</sup> equals the absolute-precision of the element which has the lowest absolute-precision among those in the sum.
4. For each i>=0, (x*ai*(u<sup>e*n+i</sup>)).absolute_precision() = x.absolute_precision() + e*n+i.
5. 3. and 4. imply that: (x*p<sup>n</sup>).absolute_precision() = (x*a0*(u<sup>e*n</sup>)).absolute_precision() = x.absolute_precision() + e*n.
Therefore, the absolute-precision has indeed been increased by exactly e*n.
* Correctness in case min_val is positive:
  Denote the valuation of x by v, and: x = a0*(u<sup>v</sup>) + a1*(u<sup>v+1</sup>) + ... 
  If the i-th element in this sum is truncated when setting the precision of x to  (absprec - (min_val * e)), it means that i >= (absprec - (min_val * e)). 
  Now, I claim that this element would also be truncated if we set the precision after the shifting. Let's assume for simplicity that p is a power of the uniformizer: p=u<sup>e</sup>, which implies that: p<sup>min_val</sup>=u<sup>min_val*e</sup>. 
  We need to shift x by p<sup>min_val</sup> and then truncate its precision to absprec. 
  So the i-th element is shifted by min_val*e entries, and now equals: ai*(u<sup>v+i+min_val*e</sup>). 
  Now we set the result (x*p<sup>min_val</sup>) to precision absprec. We assumed that i >= (absprec - (min_val * e)). Therefore i+min_val*e >= absprec, which implies that this element (ai*(u<sup>v+i+min_val*e</sup>)) is truncated. 
  Therefore I think that if min_val is large enough so that x is 0 modolu (absprec - (min_val * e)), it is O.K because x would be truncated either way. Am I right in this deduction?

* The problem I had with changing the precision after the shifting, is that I don't know how to increase precision of elements (the only method I found to be relevant is lift_to_precision, but it does not guarantee that the new entries that are added to the element are zero-entries). So if I wanted to do this, I would have to make sure that the precision needs to be decreased rather than increased.

Hi Julian!
Sorry about the very-long-delay in answering your comment. \\
Can you please explain, or give an example, why there should be a problem with the capped-relative case? I tried to think about it but didn't manage to figure out myself.\\
