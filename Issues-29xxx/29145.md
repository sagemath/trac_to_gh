A few things:

It would be good to have a more clear indication for this list here

```diff
             sage: g.representatives()
             [Scheme morphism:
                From: Closed subscheme of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:

                Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x, y) to
                      ((y + 1)/x)]
```
and similar changes for the other tests in this method.

Do you need to move the `SchemeMorphism.__init__(self, parent)` in `SchemeMorphism_polynomial.__init__`? I feel it would be better to do it after the possible error messages for when those are raised so as to not do unnecessary work (granted, if it is needed to be initialized for the tests, then this comment is moot).

PEP8:

```diff
-p = source_ring(poly.numerator())/source_ring(poly.denominator())
+p = source_ring(poly.numerator()) / source_ring(poly.denominator())
```

I don't understand this bit of code:

```
        if not self.codomain().is_projective():
            pass
```
There is no `else` statement attached, so I feel it can be removed.

Is the `Chow_form` still usable by instances of `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective`? Are they suppose to be?

OK. Done.

No. You are right. I wrongly thought it is needed. Moved back.

This part was "to do", and then I somehow  forgot.. Now I filled the missing part, which is for morphisms from projective subscheme to affine space. Thank you for spotting this!

`Chow_form` method assumes the base ring is a field.  Methods of `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective` should assume just rings. So it would be usable when the assumption is met.
