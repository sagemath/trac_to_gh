http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/

When preparing the reduced tarball with `spkg-src`, 
we should rename the non-portable file names with a colon in them:

```
$ find . -name "*:*"
./doc/pari/Programming_in_GP:_control_statements.html
./doc/pari/Programming_in_GP:_other_specific_functions.html
./doc/pari/cont_Programming_in_GP:_other_specific_functions.html
./doc/pari/cont_Programming_in_GP:_control_statements.html
```

(problematic at least on Windows - as reported in #28549.)

Previous updates:
- #26315 Upgrade to Giac 1.5
- #28101 update giac to 1.5.0-63

Follow-up: #29552 (Upgrade giac to 1.5.0-87) ... for Sage 9.2

apparently it's already fixed, for the upcoming release, i.e.
https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.tgz
I see no `:` in filenames.

For `html-stable`, I see

```

-rw-r--r-- 1 dimpase dimpase   26979 Jul 19  2016  Programming_in_GP:_control_statements.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 dimpase dimpase   39993 Dec  1  2018  Programming_in_GP__control_statements.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 dimpase dimpase   46872 Jul 19  2016  Programming_in_GP:_other_specific_functions.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 dimpase dimpase   78935 Dec  1  2018  Programming_in_GP__other_specific_functions.html
```

so these files with `:` are just leftovers, by looking at dates...
