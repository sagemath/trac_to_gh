We can assume that internal code is safe and so we can avoid checking that the result is a valid diagram (of the correct type). This gets approximately a 2x speedup (once that dominates versus the overhead) for the Temperley-Lieb algebra.

This also greatly improves the time to get the basis elements. Although the Temperley-Lieb could also benefit from a more specialized implementation of the multiplication and generation of the diagrams (see, e.g., the implementation in #29696).
