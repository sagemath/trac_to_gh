This is a follow-up on #29053: Add debian/fedora/arch package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help

This ticket adds `.github/workflows/tox.yml`, which installs a number of system packages and then runs `./bootstrap`, `./configure`, and `make`.

Most of the interesting parts are in #29053 - everything can be run "locally" (with tox and docker). This ticket only adds a simple additional file to run this automatically with several jobs on [GitHub](GitHub) Actions on a [GitHub](GitHub) pull request.

For each of the Linux distributions supported, there are two configurations: 
- `minimal` - has enough packages so that the build can succeed; 
- `standard` - has additionally all standard packages for which we have `spkg-configure.m4`.

GitHub Actions runs these build jobs on 2-core machines with 7 GB of RAM memory and 14 GB of SSD disk space (https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources), and has a time limit of 6h per job. This is just barely enough for a typical `minimal` build followed by `make ptest` to succeed; and plenty of time for a typical `standard` build to succeed.

Yes, I understand these concerns. To avoid lock-in, in this ticket the definition of the tests (for linux) is driven by tox and docker, rather than relying on the specific environments provided by a CI vendor. Likewise for the homebrew tests for macOS on this ticket. 

I don't have the time to work on another CI platform but would certainly welcome it if other CI enthusiasts wanted to implement a solution on another platform in a follow-up ticket.
