 I was working on FreeBSD with 9.1.beta9 and pari as a system package without any problem related to gp / pari.

Yesterday I switched to 9.1.rc1, with the same external package, and now the compilation of cysignals aborts with this message:


```

[cysignals-1.10.2]     /usr/local/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libpari.so: error adding symbols: bad value
```

Anyone with the same problem on other OS, or is it specific to FreeBSD?

Actually, this problem was caused by a mix between pari being built by Sage, and a linkage with libpari.so provided by the system package.

The root cause of this error is a bug in pari's spkg-configure.m4: see ticket:28242#comment:53
