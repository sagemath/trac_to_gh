<a id='comment:14'></a>Here are my comments:

```diff
             if isinstance(scalar, Element):
-                P = self.parent()
                 if not self:
                     return self
+                P = self.parent()
```

I believe this is faster:

```diff
-                    return (P.sign_analogue(scalar)) * self
+                    return self if P.sign_analogue(scalar) > 0 else -self
```
Note that the sign should never be 0.

This is overly complicated and not quite correct:

```python
        self.sign_analogue = sign_analogue
        if self.sign_analogue is None:
            if self.__default_sign is not None:
                self.sign_analogue = self.__default_sign
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError(
                    "Sign Representation is only defined over FiniteGroups and CoxeterGroups, and not over {}".format(
                        type(group)
                    )
                )
```
I would instead do

```python
         if sign_analogue is None:
             try:
                 self.sign_analogue = self._default_sign
             except AttributeError:
                 raise TypeError("a sign function must be given")
```
Furthermore, I would call it `sign_function` instead of `sign_analogue`.
Also, you should use a single underscore for `_default_sign`.

You can remove the `__init__` implementation for all of the concrete base classes (although please move the `TestSuite` test to the class-level doc).

This is overly complicated:
{{#!diff
-return ((elem.order() % 2) * -2) + 1
+return (-1)**elem.order()
}}}
and similar for the Coxeter group code.

Shouldn't there be a similar generic

```
def sign_representation(self, base_ring=None, side="twosided"):
```
for objects in the category of finite groups?

sage: G = AbelianGroup([3,5])
sage: x,y = G.gens()
sage: x.order(), y.order()

sage: (x*y).order()
