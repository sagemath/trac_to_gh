As reported on [ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50814/error-with-rational-input-in-integervectors/), we have the following unexpected behavior of IntegerVectors:

```
sage: IntegerVectors(2,3).list()
[[2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]]
sage: IntegerVectors(2,3/1).list()
[[2, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]]
```
The relevant code block in the implementation of IntegerVectors seems to be the following:

```
    try:
        return IntegerVectors_nnondescents(n, tuple(k))
    except TypeError:
        pass

    return IntegerVectors_nk(n, k)
```
For k=3/1 one has that tuple(k) does not give a TypeError (as opposed to tuple(3)) and thus the code never tries to interpret k as an integer.

```
sage: tuple(3/1)
(3,)
sage: tuple(3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 tuple(Integer(3))

TypeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object is not iterable
```

This is standard Python [PEP 3141](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3141/) see also [the documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html).

> why is this better than "k in ZZ" ?


I never said it was better. But it is certainly more Pythonic.
