CC:  @mkoeppe @dimpase @dcoudert

When homebrew is detected, the "hints" at the end of running `./configure` should suggest running the script `.homebrew-build-env`.

[Marking it as critical because it has the potential of reducing the number of support questions for release 9.1]

Questions: 

- should `.homebrew-build-env` have a `#!...` line at the top?
- with zsh, the new default shell on OS X, `. .homebrew-build-env` fails, but `source .homebrew-build-env` works. Do we always suggest `source .homebrew...`, or is there a reason to suggest `. .homebrew...`, for example when using bash? With zsh:

```
% . .homebrew-build-env     
.: no such file or directory: .homebrew-build-env
```
 I guess in zsh, the correct invocation with `.` would be `. ./.homebrew-...`: you have to specify the path.

Good idea. We should recommend `source ./.homebrew-build-env` then.

No `#!` because it must be sourced, not executed

If one sources this file, one would always need to make sure that it is sourced whenever one runs `make` or `sage -b`, right? If so, the hint should mention this. Still, I would probably forget about it sooner or later and end up with a broken build.

Okay. I think it will still be an FAQ, since people are not in the habit of running `./configure` before running `make`.

I still don't see the message at the end of `./configure`, though, when I have installed all of the recommended packages:

```
$ ./configure
...
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc gp2c libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_term_readline_gnu
checking for the package system in use... homebrew
configure: No equivalent system packages for homebrew are known to Sage

We have two tickets for reducing the number of times that `configure` gets run: #29460 (Run configure less often) and #29310 ("make distclean" should not run "./configure")

This strong statement is not true because of #29448 (configure finds libpng but matplotlib does not) and perhaps also #27205 (Sage ignores libs from pkgconfig).

But a weaker statement is true: The set of settings that I make in `.homebrew-build-env` is minimal so that configure finds everything.
