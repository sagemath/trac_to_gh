When homebrew is detected, the "hints" at the end of running `./configure` should suggest running the script `.homebrew-build-env`.

[Marking it as critical because it has the potential of reducing the number of support questions for release 9.1]

Questions: 

- should `.homebrew-build-env` have a `#!...` line at the top?
- with zsh, the new default shell on OS X, `. .homebrew-build-env` fails, but `source .homebrew-build-env` works. Do we always suggest `source .homebrew...`, or is there a reason to suggest `. .homebrew...`, for example when using bash? With zsh:

```
% . .homebrew-build-env     
.: no such file or directory: .homebrew-build-env
```
 I guess in zsh, the correct invocation with `.` would be `. ./.homebrew-...`: you have to specify the path.

Good idea. We should recommend `source ./.homebrew-build-env` then.

No `#!` because it must be sourced, not executed

If one sources this file, one would always need to make sure that it is sourced whenever one runs `make` or `sage -b`, right? If so, the hint should mention this. Still, I would probably forget about it sooner or later and end up with a broken build.

I am not suggesting to delete it, as it is used by the tox system, but, if my understanding is correct, then it certainly seems less error-prone if Sage could be configured to source it during the build process.

How about this version?

```
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc gp2c libsemigroups ninja_build pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_term_readline_gnu
checking for the package system in use... homebrew
configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ brew install ninja
# Afterwards: 
# To automatically take care of homebrew messages regarding 
# keg-only packages for the current shell session:
# $ source /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/.homebrew-build-env
# Add this to your shell profile if you want it to persist between shell sessions.
configure: After installation, re-run configure using:
configure:   $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status

I would like to keep all interactions with the system package manager on the level of hints issued to the user.
The user should be in charge of their environment.

Okay. I think it will still be an FAQ, since people are not in the habit of running `./configure` before running `make`.

I still don't see the message at the end of `./configure`, though, when I have installed all of the recommended packages:

```
$ ./configure
...
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc gp2c libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_term_readline_gnu
checking for the package system in use... homebrew
configure: No equivalent system packages for homebrew are known to Sage
$

Did you run bootstrap? There is already a change that does that

Running bootstrap fixes it. When does that need to be run? The only information I see says to run it if `./configure` doesn't exist.

This strong statement is not true because of #29448 (configure finds libpng but matplotlib does not) and perhaps also #27205 (Sage ignores libs from pkgconfig).

But a weaker statement is true: The set of settings that I make in `.homebrew-build-env` is minimal so that configure finds everything.

You only need to run it on the ticket because the configure tarball is not current.
