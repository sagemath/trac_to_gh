I find the documentation of `QQ.random_element` to be lacking.

The arguments `num_bound` and `denom_bound` are not described. There is no INPUT section at all. The examples use these arguments, but without explaining their meaning either.

There is a note that extra arguments are “passed through”, but there is no saying *where* they get passed (namely to `ZZ.random_element`). One really needs to look at the source code in order to understand this method.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17936

Here is a commit improving the documentation. I've also dropped the bounds from the example with the 1/n distribution, since that distribution ignores all bounds. And I've repeated the examples a couple of times, since at my first try I got too many strange numbers which don't demonstrate the method, like integers and zeros. An alternative would be increasing the bounds, but at least for the simple no-args example that's no solution.
