Is the `is_one` check always quick? Otherwise we shouldn't do it (or implement a faster test).

For scalar fields `is_one` is slow, because it amounts to comparing a symbolic expression to 1. For comparing to 1, we don't have the equivalent of the fast method `is_trivial_zero`.

The base ring is supposed to be the symbolic ring. Anyway, I've changed the check of `1` to a trivial and hence faster one.

This should be a much faster check. LGTM.

Damn it. Can this be made undone?
