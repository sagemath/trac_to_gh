Dictionaries are mutable, and copying them using `copy` results in dictionaries that share internal objects, which causes unwelcome surprises.

The fix can be taken from https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/commit/7fa320fd412a80ac7fe6305b03f2d6e2d1808d7e but it would be easiest to do this on top of #31307 to avoid a merge conflict.
