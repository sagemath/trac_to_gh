# Issue 13398: partition distinct parts max part error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13602

Original creator: ahmorales

Original creation time: 2012-10-15 15:47:41

Assignee: Alejandro Morales

CC:  chrisjamesberg

Keywords: partitions

In the documentation for _Partitions_:

[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/partition.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/partition.html)

it says that the parameter _max_slope=-1_ yields partitions into distinct parts", and the parameter _max_part=k_ specifies that all parts of the partitions are at most k. However when you specify both parameters together _max_slope=-1, max_part=k_ it does not yield partitions into distinct parts and parts at most k.

Example:


```
Partitions(4,max_slope=-1,max_part=2).list()
```


returns


```
[[2,2]]
```


but according to the documentation the answer should be 


```
[[]]
```

This is essentially #12278. I've copied this example over there.
