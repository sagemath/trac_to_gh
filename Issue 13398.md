Keywords: partitions

In the documentation for *Partitions*:

[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/partition.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/partition.html)

it says that the parameter *max_slope=-1* yields partitions into distinct parts", and the parameter *max_part=k* specifies that all parts of the partitions are at most k. However when you specify both parameters together *max_slope=-1, max_part=k* it does not yield partitions into distinct parts and parts at most k.

Example:


```
Partitions(4,max_slope=-1,max_part=2).list()
```


returns


```
[[2,2]]
```


but according to the documentation the answer should be 


```
[[]]
```
