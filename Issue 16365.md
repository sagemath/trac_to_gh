# Issue 16365: Immutable graphs don't work with canonical_relabel()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16602

The default `copy(G)` of a graph `G` returns `G`, and then `relabel` can't do a relabeling inplace.

```
sage: G = Graph([[1, 2], [2, 3]], immutable=True)
sage: C = G.canonical_label() # Boom
```
