# Issue 28532: Scalar field raise AttributeError on show_identifiers call

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28769

Original creator: @LBrunswic

Original creation time: 2019-11-19 10:15:06

CC:  egourgoulhon

Keywords: Manifold, save_

The following snippet raises `AttributeError`

```python
M = Manifold(1, 'M')
C.<x> = M.chart()
phi = M.scalar_field(0)
show_identifiers()
  }}}

This prevents saving any sage session containing a scalar field object.

The issue was due to an exception not catched in `ScalarField.__eq__()`. This is fixed in the above commit.
