Assignee: mvngu

Section 2.3 of the SageTeX documentation ("Using TeXShop") is incomplete.  It mentions the "%!TEX" string, but more details are either necessary or potentially helpful.

The following text should replace the text after the discussion of the sage engine:

Once the file `sage.engine' is placed in the `Engines' directory, TeXShop should be restarted so that it recognizes the new engine.

The engine is invoked in one of two ways.  The first is by selecting it in the pulldown menu to the right of the "Typeset" button.  The second is by putting the following line
     %!TEX TS-program = sage
with the first 12 lines at the beginning of the .tex file in question.  Note that, in this line, there must be exactly one space on either side of the "=".  Note that the "%TEX" string is only useful when the file is typeset with TeXShop.

I don't know "obvious" it is, but I read sage-devel, so mentioning it there is as good as "reporting upstream". :)  You can also email me directly.

I can pull a diff out of your spkg. I'll try to get to this later this week.
