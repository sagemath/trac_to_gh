To change the Sage banner, you need to modify the file `devel/sage/sage/misc/banner.py`. The file `local/bin/sage-banner` is auto-generated from that file.

Yep, i just discovered that, i was misleaded by the fact that sage-banner appears in the sage-scripts repository http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-scripts/src. I will update the patch accordingly. Thanks.

Maybe we should make the style configurable...

It should definitely be configurable! But I guess a user do not want to hack the source at each version. There might be a function in "$HOME/.sage/init.sage" or "$HOME/.sage/custom_banner" succeptible of doing the job (to whom we send the version, the release date, etc).

Maybe we should introduce half a dozen new environment variables to control this. Right, Leif? ;)

More seriously, I'm happy with the current patch. Do we want to get that merged soon and deal with further customization on another ticket, or deal with everything here?

Let's postpone making the banner configurable until we have solved all other trac tickets.
