# Issue 28995: Let `std` work on a list of floats

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29232

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-02-21 17:22:48

CC:  chapoton slelievre

Keywords: float, std, sqrt

Initial report by Ingo Dahn at:

- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/cocalc/rblsUHwBXQc/discussion

Minimal example:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01'
sage: sage: std([float(3.2), float(3.4)])
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```


Fix this by changing the function `std(v, bias)` at line 219 of
`src/sage/stats/basic_stats.py`:


```
-    return variance(v, bias=bias).sqrt()
+    try:
+        return variance(v, bias=bias).sqrt()
+     except AttributeError:
+        return sqrt(variance(v, bias=bias))
```
