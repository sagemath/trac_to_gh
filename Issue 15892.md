The way caching is implemented in `EllipticCurve_generic` causes some trouble
at #11895. Several methods, such as `_multiple_x_numerator`,
`_multiple_x_denominator`, `division_polynomial_0` should be rewritten such that they do not use a `cache` parameter anymore.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16129

Looks good to me; now running doctests.

I'm just slightly worried that some of the methods may cache too much, because the caching key depends on `x`, which can just be a concrete *x*-value rather than a polynomial variable.  However, this already seems to have been the case before this ticket, so maybe we can keep it like that for now.

All doctests pass, but building documentation was interrupted due to a warning which was caused by missing indentation.  Hence a trivial reviewer patch.
