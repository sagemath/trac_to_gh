# Issue 26216: Relicense sphinxify.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26453

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2018-10-10 10:20:23

sphinxify.py is "Distributed under the terms of the BSD License". It's unclear which license is meant here so we should be more precise (note that the original BSD license is not GPL compatible.)

I contacted the original author to ask permission to change this to GPLv2+.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
