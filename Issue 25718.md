1. What is the following intended for

```
        try:
            alph = self.parent().alphabet()
        except AttributeError:
            raise ValueError("Alphabet of input word not initialized.")
```

  If this can occur it should be documented.

2. The line length in the documentation should not exceed 72 characters. You must split the lines accordingly.

3. In the documentation you should not expect the user to have an article under their eyes. In the one-line description (the begining of the documentation) simply avoid citations. In the examples, it is nice to say that the example comes from an article but it should also be explained in words.

4. This syntax is wrong

```
        EXAMPLES::

        We begin by illustrating the modular sweep map following Example 3.1 of [1]_ ::

            sage: Word([3,1,1,3,2,1,4],IntegerModRing(5)).sweep()
            word: 1331421
```

   there should be only one colon after `EXAMPLES`.

5. There should be a linebreak after `TESTS::`

6. no punctuation in error messages (ie do not start with upper case and no point at the end)

7. Instead of `isinstance(alph,IntegerRing_class)` use `alph is ZZ`

8. `ValueError("Failure")` should be a `RuntimeError`

9. In the documentation there should be spaces around signs like `=`

Nathan, if you really intend to include your code in sage, please follow what happens on the tickets and answer to the suggestions.

Dropping a branch and leaving is not a constructive thing to do.
