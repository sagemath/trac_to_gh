# Issue 12610: When building GCC, build MPIR without the C++ interface

When we are building MPIR as dependency for GCC, build MPIR without the C++ interface.  After GCC is installed, MPIR is built again.  The second time we do build the C++ interface.  This would allow for building Sage on systems without a C++ compiler.

In principle this looks okay, but I don't know when I'll have time to check it thoroughly.

I've incorporated similar changes into the MPIR 2.4.0.*p2* spkg at #11616.  (See description _there_ for details.)
