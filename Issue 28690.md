# Issue 28690: DESTDIR support for libbraiding and libhomfly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28927

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2019-12-30 16:25:16

Keywords: libhomfly libbraiding destdir

These were made into standard packages in #25705, just a little after work began on #24024, so they were omitted from the list of packages on that ticket and were never handled properly.
