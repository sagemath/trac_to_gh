right. I have added a reverse=True.

That's of course safer. I'm now using the degree_iterator instead since .degree(labels=True) returns a dictionary. 

> * seen is a set, not a dictionary


I was wondering if it is faster to use a dict or a set in this case. I'm now using a set.

> * Why do you remove all this `h>=2` code ?


What we had before was incorrect. We were assuming that as soon as h>=2 it was not necessary to consider some vertices anymore (hence the h>=2 code). Since, we have proved that this is not true due to (a|b1,b2,b3) 4-tuples.

Now, the method is given a distance matrix and a set of vertices that we should not considered during computations. We order the pairs in such a way that pairs incident to vertices that should not be considered are above last_pair in the arrays. Observe that these orderings are done in linear time (in the number of pairs).

The other option was extract from the distance matrix the submatrix containing only distances between vertices we want to consider. I don't know which method is the fastest, but it was trivial to update the code the way I did it.

I'm just combining the cost of taking the subgraph with the cost of relabeling the vertices. I think it's overall faster than splitting the calls, even if the new relabel method is fast.


I'm now also improving upper bounds since delta <= D/2.

Thanks,

The "cuts+" algorithm is an approximation algorithm with additive constant one (ALG <= OPT <= ALG+1). Therefore, additive/multiplicative approx factors are irrelevant in this case.
However, these parameters are still used with the "cuts" version.

We could may be combine additive approx with "cuts+", for instance asking for "2*(additive_gap-1)". I'm not sure it is really interesting.

Does it make more sense?

Yep. But the code did something different.

Cool. Could you also add a doctest for `algorithm="dom"` ? It looks like there's a bug there :

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: hyperbolicity(g,algorithm="dom")
(0, [], 0)
```

I would say that the dominating set has `<4` vertices. Note that it isn't a problem per se, but the upper bound is clearly wrong.

Bloody hell, the Petersen!

The `__hyperbolicity__` method was implicitly assuming that delta(G)>0 since graphs such that delta(G)=0 are tested before. But with 'dom' the situation may happen. I have added what is needed to prevent such problem (also with cuts+).

Should be better now.

It really is a counter-example to everything !

Why do you add more code ? I don't get it. The fact that there is no quadruple in the answer to Petersen's graph hyperbolicity is not a problem as the lower bound is zero. The only problem is that the upper bound is 8 ! You just had to test this case before returning the result, didn't you ?

Exactly, whatever the method, at some point we need a certificate. So either I ensure that __hyperbolicity__ always returns a solution, or I have to test the result afterward, or both.

I think the code is safer now and it returns correct result. Some parts could be simplified if we had a nice implementation for delta <=1, or a nice decomposition by clique separators, etc. But this is another story.
