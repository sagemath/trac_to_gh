This :

* passes its own test suite (modulo numerical noise and expected failures) ;
* installs my current library of 468 extra packages at first attempt ;
* passes `ptestlong` with no failure whatsoever.

==> `needs_review`. As usual, special attention on Mac OS X is sought (changes in the prerequisites for C++)...

On  OSX 10.13, while running R's self-tests I see

```

But I think it's OK, it's not Sage's job to fix this, if there was anything to fix here.

Please always (for the time being anyways until the buildbot is more stable) give me a chance to review any major package version updates before setting them to "positive review".

The R developers in particular have been historically hostile toward Cygwin support...

That's what I called "numerical noise".

Okay, Madison, I'll try to remember this.

But you'll get to be CC'd on any such change.... ;-).

Do you think you'll be able to review this in time for 8.8 ?

Yes, I promise.  I'm just now waiting for my `make ptestlong` of 8.8.beta5 to finish then I can do it.

There probably won't be any major problems, but as there was at least a 3.5.x to 3.6.x bump I could imagine there being new build system problems or something like that.

Ok, well it builds, and the tests for the R interface pass, so that's good enough for me for now.  I would not be surprised if there are still Cygwin bugs with R (I don't think `make check` has ever passed) but as long as building Sage works and the interface works in principle that's what matters here.
