`cholesky_decomposition()` is needlessly verbose, and the existing spaghetti code with `_cholesky_decomposition()` is too convoluted to unwind.  Dependencies install the **new** `cholesky()` along side.

The old `cholesky_decomposition()` is so broken that nobody should be using it anyway, thus it should be no problem to obsolete it.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13045

Importing the deprecation machinery seemed to set off some Python deprecation warnings about messages on exceptions, so those have been modernized.

One note: string formatting when raising an exception is, in many cases, a really bad idea, since generating the string may take a really long time. This mostly happens when trying to represent a very large number or other Sage object, and can dramatically slow down some algorithms which try things, catch exceptions, and then try other things without looking at the error message.

I *think* the string formatting here is fine, since it should just be mixing in another simple error message, but it seems wise to leave a warning here.

In the warning, you should link to the new `cholesky` function:  `:meth:`cholesky``.

More seriously, the caching means that this broken, crappy function can infect the new, correct function:

```
sage: r = matrix(CDF, 2, 2, [ 1, -2*I, 2*I, 0 ]); r
[   1.0 -2.0*I]
[ 2.0*I    0.0]
sage: r[0,0] = 0
sage: r.cholesky_decomposition()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
sage: r.cholesky()
[        0.0         0.0]
[NaN + NaN*I NaN + NaN*I]
```

The documentation makes it clear that `cholesky_decomposition` can return bad answers, but the new function shouldn't be infected by that.

Update patch addresses reviewer comments: cholesky is linked in warning, cache strings are separated, and a doctest for that is added.

Apply new patch on top of old.

Separating the caches does show us that the new routine is much faster:

sage: %time M.cholesky()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s

  out = eval(code,glob)
CPU times: user 23.33 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 23.34 s
Wall time: 23.42 s
200 x 200 dense matrix over Complex Double Field
```

About three orders of magnitude. Nice.
