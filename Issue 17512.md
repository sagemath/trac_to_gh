Keywords: GMP-ECM

According to GCC 4.4 release notes:

"""
The MIPS port no longer recognizes the h asm constraint. It was necessary to remove this constraint in order to avoid generating unpredictable code sequences.
One of the main uses of the h constraint was to extract the high part of a multiplication on 64-bit targets. For example:

```
    asm ("dmultu\t%1,%2" : "=h" (result) : "r" (x), "r" (y));
```
You can now achieve the same effect using 128-bit types:

```
    typedef unsigned int uint128_t __attribute__((mode(TI)));
    result = ((uint128_t) x * y) >> 64;
```
The second sequence is better in many ways. For example, if x and y are constants, the compiler can perform the multiplication at compile time. If x and y are not constants, the compiler can schedule the runtime multiplication better than it can schedule an asm statement.
"""

Unfortunately the latest version of GMP-ECM still uses this construction making it impossible to build on mips:

It turns out GMP-ECM is not the only package with issues:
ntl has exactly the same issue with h constraints while tachyon will completely refuse to build:

is it worth reporting these upstream or should just give up on having sage running on a ci20?

Replying to [comment:3 etn40ff]:

If you care enough: of course.

For Tachyon, you should check first that the statement "your platform isn't supported by Tachyon" is actually true.

as for GMP-ECM, line 90 of `sp.h` includes `longlong.h`, which was copied from GMP.
The h asm constraint is in `longlong.h`, there is no such constraint in GMP-ECM itself.

I've looked at GMP 6.0.0: longlong.h contains a different umul_ppmm code for GCC >= 4.4.

A workaround would be to replace the longlong.h file in GMP-ECM by the one from GMP 6.0.0.
Please can you confirm it solves the problem?
