The body of this function is unreachable,

```python
cdef bint _has_labeled_edge_unsafe(self, int u_int, int v_int, object l) except -1:
    """                                                                     
    Return whether ``self`` has an arc specified by indices of the vertices 
    and an arc label.                                                       
    """
    raise NotImplementedError
    cdef int l_int
    if l is None:
        l_int = 0
    else:
        l_int = self.new_edge_label(l)
    return self.cg().has_arc_unsafe(u_int, v_int, l_int)
```

Is it just an oversight?
