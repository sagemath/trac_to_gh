I don't know how to install the new package. Using the ``Ã¬nstall_package``` method, I get either a re-install of cliquer-1.2.p11, or it answers there is no package name with cliquer-1.21.p11. I tried copying the package to the standard and the optimal package directories without success.

OK, the method for installing the package is

`sage -i <package.spkg>`

or when the package is already installed (as for cliquer):

`sage -f <package.spkg>`


The patch is working perfectly and the memory usage remains constant. Excellent! I give positive review.

The spkg should be rebased on cliquer-1.2.p11.spkg (which is in sage-5.1 or later).

Also: normally, the version number of your spkg should be cliquer-1.21.p0.spkg (not p11).

The patch is still working perfectly.
