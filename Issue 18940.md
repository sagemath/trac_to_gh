Is there any place I need to change in the docs/scripts/etc. regarding the optional spkg name, or has that all become automated?

No need to change anything.

Just a few small comments:
1. is there any doctest or Sage interface to check that the package works?
2. replace `$SAGE_LOCAL/share` by `$SAGE_SHARE`.
3. add a file `build/pkgs/database_mutation_class/dependencies` (which could be just saying `# no dependencies`)

Thanks for checking.

1. Yes, but it wasn't very explicit. I made it more so.
2. Done.
3. Done. Is this a new thing? Most of the spkg folders don't seem to have one unless they have an actual dependency.

Well, it was introduced at the same that `build/pkgs/$PKG/type` was introduced. Which is pretty recent indeed.

It's not a disaster. The default for optional packages is that they depend on every standard package. It's a safe default, but not really efficient, especially given that `sage -i` will install dependencies soon (#19101).

Also, I get the same doctest output with or without this package, what is going on?

What is happening is that there is a test in one of the other files which saves some data to your `.sage` folder. This should fix things and isolates the tests specific to the database.

Christian, I'm cc-ing you in case you have any opinions on the name of the database (and to let you know that it is changing).

Isn't this actually a bug?

```
# random - depends on the data the user has stored
```

If `load_data()` returns essentially random data, how can it be useful?

It wasn't the test which was broken (hence, no need for `test_database`), the function itself was broken.

I don't consider it as one because it depends on if the user has already stored information for the rank 1 types or not. If the user hasn't computed and saved anything (or installed the database), then there is nothing to load. This is why you were getting the same output before and after, whereas I was getting less data in the output. (It also can't raise an error because it looks in 2 places for file data.)

I think it's a bug that it _does_ depend on that.

Anyway, I don't care much about this package. I will not set this ticket to needs_work for this, but I also won't set it to positive_review either.

For the patchbot, it is probably better if the tarball url appears in full.
