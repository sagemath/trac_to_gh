# Issue 13277: Problem with testjava.sh in jmol package finding bash

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: stephen

Original creation time: 2012-09-12 03:35:30

Assignee: leif

CC:  leif

Keywords: FreeBSD jmol testjava.sh

The package jmol contains testjava.sh.  The top of the file is

#!/bin/bash

Unfortunately in FreeBSD, this has to be one of:

#!/usr/local/bin/bash
or
#!/bin/sh

How about `#!/usr/bin/env bash`? That is used at the top of many Sage scripts.

Yes,  #!/usr/bin/env bash works.

I've created a new .spkg that uses 
{{{#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

It can be downloaded [here](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.3.27.p3.spkg)

To install

```
./sage -f http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/gutow/jmol-12.3.27.p3.spkg
```


Please review.
