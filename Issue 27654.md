This ticket implements new show options `flip_x` and `flip_y` for flipping the direction of axes in 2d graphics. This was previously suggested in comment:12:ticket:18463.

Currently, something similar can be achieved by setting limits such that `xmin > xmax`.

```
sage: plot(x).show(xmin=1, xmax=-1)
```

This works because it is supported by matplotlib, but it is fragile and does not seem to be documented anywhere in Sage, apart from some implementation comments in `sage.plot.graphics`. The implementation of `matrix_plot` also relies on this, as by default matrices are plotted with the vertical axis directed downward. This leads to subtle issues like the following.

```
sage: p = matrix_plot(identity_matrix(5))
sage: p.get_minmax_data()
{ xmin:-0.5, ymin:4.5, ymax:-0.5, xmax:4.5 }
sage: p2 = p + point((2, 2), zorder=1)
sage: p2.get_minmax_data()
{ xmin:-0.5, ymin:1.0, ymax:3.0, xmax:4.5 }
```

Here, the bounding box of `p` has `ymin > ymax` which does not get taken into account when adding plots. As a consequence, `p2` does not show the entire matrix.

As a solution that is hopefully more robust, this ticket adds `flip_x`/`flip_y` options that are documented to the user. For example:

```
sage: plot(x, -1, 1, flip_x=True)
```

From now on, the minmax data should always have `min <= max`, though for backward compatibility this is not enforced. When summing plots, flipped axes take precedence.

In `matrix_plot`, the now redundant option `origin='upper'`/`origin='lower'` is deprecated and replaced by `flip_y`.

Moreover, this ticket fixes an issue with plots of sparse matrices for which the data was incorrectly flipped:

```
sage: matrix_plot(identity_matrix(5, sparse=True), origin='lower')
```

Nice!

How do I do a `graphics_array` that would show the four versions of the following picture with all possible values for `flip_x`/`flip_y`? The following is somehow inconvenient

```
l = []
for flip_x in [False, True]:
    for flip_y in [False, True]:
        H = circle((1,0),2,color='red') + line2d([(-1,3),(1,5)], color='blue')
        H._extra_kwds['flip_x'] = flip_x
        H._extra_kwds['flip_y'] = flip_y
        l.append(H)
graphics_array(l,2,2)

It could be done like this:


```
graphics_array([circle((1,0),2,color='red') +
                line2d([(-1,3),(1,5)], color='blue', flip_x=flip_x, flip_y=flip_y)
                for flip_x in [False, True]
                for flip_y in [False, True]], 2, 2)
```


This works because flipped axes take precedence when taking the sum of two graphics objects.
