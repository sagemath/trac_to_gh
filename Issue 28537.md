Keywords: quadratic field, embeddings, coercion

Currently, quadratic fields are embedded into the reals or complex numbers by default.

Number fields in turn, allow pushouts only, when fields are embedded into `AA`. Therefore, the following results in a `TypeError`:

```
sage: f1 = QuadraticField(2)
sage: f2 = QuadraticField(3)
sage: f1.gen() + f2.gen()
```

We embed the `QuadraticField` into `AA` or `QQbar` by default and therefore fix this for the real algebraic case.

Possible follow ups:
- It still does not work in the non-real case, but this should be taken care of in `NumberField` instead.
- Also, one could argue, whether the coercion should really go all the way to `AA`, but this is also not an issue of `QuadraticField`.

Yes, I was thinking about this as well. Wasn't sure where to put this.

I could give such a message in the `_pushout_` method of number fields. This method will be called for sure and I think its also the last hope for coercion to work in case of number fields.

This is the best I can come up with.

To my understanding coercion of two number fields is only possible, if they are both embedded into `AA` (or `QQbar` with #28778) or if there is an embedding (discovered by `_internal_coerce_map_from`).

Raising an error or a warning does not work, as it is being suppressed.

This depends on #28778 now, as this fixes an error (along the way), where the pushout of two number fields embedded into `RLF` is `AA`. This ticket relies on the method `_pushout_` to return `None` in this case.
