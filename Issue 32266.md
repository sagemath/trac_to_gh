Small fix to ensure that we dominate only specified vertices.

You call this a heuristic, does that mean this is not guaranteed to work?

It always returns a valid dominating set. However, we have no guarantee on the size of the result. For instance, if the graph is a star with n leaves (an so n+1 vertices), a minimum dominating set has cardinality 1 (the center of the star), but this algorithm may return the set of leaves (of cardinality n). This is an example I added to show the impact of the input order of the vertices.
