I'm not sure that we need to remove all such contractions.  They are a standard part of English, and in this case may actually make the quotes from 'famous people' wrong (if they are, in fact, legitimate quotations!).  Is there a style guide I'm unfamiliar with you've been following for doing this?

Ok, I take good note of your worries about contractions.

But the main point of the ticket is the addition of `{}`, for otherwise the code is plain wrong.

I believe you, but I don't know quite enough about that part to review it properly (since the app works already).  Hopefully Travis can give it a quick review; I don't have a real problem with anything of course!

The code clearly indicates that it should be grouped under that `if` statement, so I am fine with that change (although the alignment spacing looks a little odd, but I am not going to hold a positive review up for that).

I would argue the reason to avoid contractions is this is "formal" writing, where you should not use them (or so I've been told by my paper referees when I accidentally have one slip in).

Although I cannot test that this does work (I do not mac to test it on). If someone (Karl-Dieter) can verify that this works after the change, then we can flip it to positive.

> The code clearly indicates that it should be grouped under that `if` statement, so I am fine with that change (although the alignment spacing looks a little odd, but I am not going to hold a positive review up for that).

The spacing is because the original file has lots of tabs in it, and with the branch, some of those tabs have been replaced by spaces. It's an html file, so it shouldn't matter, I think.

> I would argue the reason to avoid contractions is this is "formal" writing, where you should not use them (or so I've been told by my paper referees when I accidentally have one slip in).

In this case we're quoting people (supposedly) so we should use their original words: if they used contractions, so should we. I'm too lazy to actually search for the original quotes to verify. (I'm really just echoing what kcrisman said already.)

> Although I cannot test that this does work (I do not mac to test it on). If someone (Karl-Dieter) can verify that this works after the change, then we can flip it to positive.

I'll try to test it and report back.

First, the main functionality of the notebook works with or without this change. With the branch here, there is minor breakage: the app opens up a page in the web browser which says at the bottom, "Show a random tip. Show all." and then a random tip. Without this branch, you can click on "Show a random tip" and the tip changes. With this branch, it shows the first tip in the file and does not change. Remove the braces `{}` and it works again.
