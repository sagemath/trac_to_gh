Keywords: python3

In Py2 `zip()` returns a list, while in Py3 `zip()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.izip()` does in Py2).

The tool 2to3 wraps `zip()` usages with a call to `list()`.


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import zip` and to check where a wrapping with `list()` is required.

There are 54 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.
