You can mark this as _positive_review_ if you want.

If you want to obey PEPs strictly, add some spaces after commas; you see them with command


```
git show | egrep '^\+.+,[^ ]'
```


What is the reason to convert `print "foo: ", x` to `print("foo: {}".format(x)` instead of `print("foo:", x)`?

Thanks a lot for the reviews, Jori.

Pep8 is not the priority now. I prefer to do minimal changes, only about print.

Indeed, this is another solution, at least inside the code. I use either, in no
systematic way. But the simple way will not work in
the doc as long as we have not switched to py3.
