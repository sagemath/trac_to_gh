Along with some related fixes to `sage.misc.explain_pickle` (which otherwise still has many failures on Python 3 due mostly to string/bytes differences).

Most of these fixes have to do with pickling, especially minor differences in the API of the `pickle` module.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24582

*probably* not, since in Python 2 the `cPickle.Unpickler` class has some oddities, and in particular its `find_globals` attribute has some strange behavior.  But I agree it might be worth a try...

Oh I remember now, the only reason the tests for `SageUnpickler` even work on Python 2 is that it's subclassing the pure Python implementation in that case, which is less strange but also slower.

But perhaps I could make a single `SageUnpickler` class that delegates to the preferred underlying implementation.
