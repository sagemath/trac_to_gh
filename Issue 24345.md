Along with some related fixes to `sage.misc.explain_pickle` (which otherwise still has many failures on Python 3 due mostly to string/bytes differences).

Most of these fixes have to do with pickling, especially minor differences in the API of the `pickle` module.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24582

*probably* not, since in Python 2 the `cPickle.Unpickler` class has some oddities, and in particular its `find_globals` attribute has some strange behavior.  But I agree it might be worth a try...

```
docstring of sage.misc.persist.SageUnpickler:21: WARNING: Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.

This certainly lays the groundwork to fix issues like that, but I'll have a look at whatever's going on there.

The above issue is that it's creating pickles with Python 2 backwards-compatibility (the `fix_imports=True` argument to `pickle.dumps`).  However, the reverse should also work when loading such pickles on Python 3.
