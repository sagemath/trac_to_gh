The `decode_to_code` method of the current implementation of the `NearestNeighborDecoder` creates and stores the distances between the received word and every codeword. It then sorts the entire list in order to find the closest codeword. This takes asymptotic memory and time in the size of the code which can be very inefficient for large input. 
This should be improved.

Hello,

I finally looked at the code, my remarks follow:

- You're absolutely right, it should be `w_err` and not `word` as input to `decode_to_code` in the doctest.

- I'm not a huge fan of the check depending on `flag` which will always fail except on the first time it is performed.
I suggest you use an iterator over the codewords instead: you perform this initialization step outside the loop and then the loop only contains the comparison test on hamming weights. 
By the way, a linear code always contains the zero word, and, according to the way Sage sorts the elements of a code, `C[0]` will always be the zero vector of the ambient space of `C`.
So you can directly set `h_min` to the hamming weight of `r`. 

Something like:


```
It = iter(C.list())
c_min = It.next()
h_min = r.hamming_weight()
try:
    #loop
except StopIteration:
    pass
c_min.set_immutable()
return c_min
```


Oh, and when you finish your work on a ticket, don't forget to set it to `needs_review` (under "modify ticket button".

Apart from that, I'm fine with your code!

David

Hello,

You made a mistake when declaring the iterator: `It = iter(self.code.list())` won't work (and does not) as `code` is a method over `self`. So it should be: `It = iter(self.code().list())`.

You should always run the doctests after changing something, as they help you to catch errors of this kind.
Use these commands: 

```
sage -b #this rebuilds sage, necessary to include modifications made
sage -t <path to file> #here it will be sage -t linear_code.py
```




This does not cause any trouble here, but I like being specific with exceptions, so I'd rather say

```
try:
    #blah
except StopIteration:
    pass
```

This way, you only `pass` when a `StopIteration` occurs, and any other exception still returns the appropriate error message. Well, I don't see how any other exception could occur here, but the most accurate the better, doesn't it?

Best,

David

I have ever only created explicit iterators in very rare cases in Python.

Hello,

You have two choices here:

1) You rollback to the previous implementation using a for loop, but in that case you get rid of anything related to iterators.
2) You stick to the idea using iterator, and in that case, you actually use an iterator.

In your latest push, you removed the line creating the iterator, but kept the try/except block which attempts to catch a `StopIteration` exception... Which cannot occur, because there is no longer an iterator available!

Pick the one you prefer, and change the rest of the code accordingly.

Another remark: if you think your push is ready for review, please set the ticket to `needs_review` :)

Best,

David
