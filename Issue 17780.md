# Issue 17780: tableau methods `bump` and `schensted_insert` perform same function

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: days64, tableau

Actually schensted_insert has options form inserting on either the right or the left. Bump is equivalent to inserting on the right. Since the implementation of bump is slightly faster, we delete the _right_schensted_insert method and have schensted_insert call bump instead.
