Assignee: malb

CC:  jhpalmieri

Keywords: Cohen-Macaulay, homology, simplicial complexes

Simplicial complexes were lacking a method to test Cohen-Macaulayness.

In order to implement this method, some other methods are improved, namely a hash function is implemented, and _enlarge_subcomplex has become faster.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11523

I'm sorry, I forgot about this ticket.

Overall, I think this looks pretty good.  Some comments and questions:

- I had to rebase this against 4.7.2.alpha2.
- why have both `is_cohen_macaulay` and `is_cohen_macaulay_parallel`?  When would you ever want to use the first one?  With ncpus=1, the parallel one is about as fast as the first, so should we get rid of the first one?
- on the other hand, when I run the parallel version with ncpus=1, I sometimes see an error:

```
Exception OSError: (10, 'No child processes') in <generator object __call__ at 0x10d20ee10> ignored
```

 and then the computation proceeds.  Should we try to catch this and hide it?  Can we do that if it says "ignored"?
- in my testing (`timeit('simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(5,2).homology()')`), I saw no change in the time required to do homology computations from the old version to the new one, but if you have other ideas for speeding things up, please implement them.
- the method `face_iterator` has no documentation.

I don't know if this was ready for review, but I'm attaching a new version of the patch which makes some of these changes: it renames `is_cohen_macaulay` to `_is_cohen_macaulay_serial` (so it's hidden), renames the parallel version to `is_cohen_macaulay`.  I wonder if we should set ncpus to be 2 by default instead of 1?  I'll try testing on a machine with just one cpu to see what effect that has.

Thanks for looking at it again, I hope we can get it into sage soon, as it was pretty much done. The only reason why I stopped working was that I thought I can still speed things up, but I never found the time to do so.

that was just a left-over, as I first implemented is_cohen_macaulay and then started to play with the parallel version.

If I remember right, this happens not only for 1 cpu, but if a negative answer is returned without waiting the other parallel sessions to be finished. I agree that we should catch that error!

See my comment at the beginning.

I will add it!

This is mostly good.  The only problems are with the parallel version: if I run with more than one process, I get a message like

```
sage: X.is_cohen_macaulay(2)
Killing any remaining workers...
False
```

If I run it with one process, I get

```
sage: X.is_cohen_macaulay(1)
Killing any remaining workers...
Exception OSError: (10, 'No child processes') in <generator object __call__ at 0x10ca39a00> ignored
False
```

We should be able to catch the error.  Can we also suppress the message "Killing any remaining workers..."?

I tried to catch it, but it it already caught somewhere inside the decorator, so I don't know how to suppress the output, do you?

Hey Christian and John,

This did not apply against #12587, so I did the very minor rebase in my review patch (it contains the entire patch; sorry if I overstepped here). I also made some minor docstring changes: some formatting and moved the note about the exception in a `.. NOTE::` block. If you agree with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.

Thanks for your work on this, I plan on putting this to good use,

Travis
