Keywords: random, combinatorics, binary trees

I am overwritting the default random_element method of the BinaryTree_size class to implement an efficient way to compute a random binary tree.

As explained in the documentation, we use the fact that binary trees are in bijection with Dyck words.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17241
