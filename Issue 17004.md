# Issue 17004: Uniform random generation  of BinaryTree of a given size

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: g.chatel

Keywords: random, combinatorics, binary trees

I am overwritting the default random_element method of the BinaryTree_size class to implement an efficient way to compute a random binary tree.

As explained in the documentation, we use the fact that binary trees are in bijection with Dyck words.

Made a little change (once again, please use specific classes rather than generic factories/dispatchers when possible), otherwise looks good to me. If you are fine with this, please set it to positive_review.
