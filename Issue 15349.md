Sole non-trivial modification was to remove a patch now upstream.
Whatsoever, we should still take care of #14097.

tarball is `go-r`

```
vbraun@boxen:~$ ll /home/jpflori/upstream/valgrind-3.9.0.tar.bz2
-rw------- 1 jpflori jpflori 10003156 2013-12-25 08:42 /home/jpflori/upstream/valgrind-3.9.0.tar.bz2

I dislike

```diff
+if [ "$UNAME" = "Linux" ]; then
+ echo "Good - Valgrind works on Linux"
+ if [ "`uname -p`" = "ia64" ]; then
+ echo >&2 "But it does not work on Itanium"
+ exit 1
+ fi
+else
+ if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ] && [ -z "`uname -p | grep PPC`" ] && [ `uname -r | grep -Eo '^[0-9]+'` -ge 9 ];
+ then
+ echo "Good - Valgrind works on x86 and AMD64 Darwin 9.x or 10.x"
+ else
+ echo >&2 "Sorry, Valgrind only works on x86,AMD64,PPC32,PPC64,ARM Linux"
+ echo >&2 "and x86,AMD64 on Darwin 9.x/10.x"\
+ "(Mac OS X 10.5.x or later)"
+ exit 1
+ fi
+fi
```


If it doesn't work, fine, just let the build fail (one would hope that upstream gives a reasonable error message in this case). Too often, these kind of checks prevent building on systems which are perfectly fine.

Also, the suppressions are not patches so I see no reason to put them in the `patches` directory.

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

The good/bad stuff is historical.

As far as non patch stuff in the patches directory, I had the feeling some other packages did that.

And my first concern here is that I tested the package a couple of days ago and:
* it does not build at first, stupid glibc version restriction as usual with valgrind...
* and it does not work properly, or at least did not for me: at least Sage now launches (not as reported in #14097 which I could reproduce when the ticket was active), but I cannot exit it...

(I tested it on ppc64 and x86_64.)

I'm moving the suppression files to `$SAGE_EXTCODE/valgrind/sage.supp`, that way we can even use the system valgrind (which is also more likely to work with your version of glibc).

Works and is actually useful (doesn't spew spurious pyalloc warnings all the time)

Replying to [comment:13 jpflori]:

Perhaps, but I still think it should be removed.

Volker: One naive question: is the sage -valgind stuff actually working for you? last time I tested (see above), everything was actually broken except for Sage starting.)


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-10-08 09:24:30

Yes, works. Fixed that, too :-)


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-10-09 10:34:51

It seems there is an issue with the new location of the supp files and where the sage-valgrind script looks for.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-10-09 11:49:01

Whats the issue? You need to run "make" to install it to `SAGE_EXTCODE`.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-10-09 11:50:19

Oh my bad....
Then everything is OK.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-10-09 12:06:07

I'm still getting thousands of errors when starting up. Is that expected ?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-10-09 12:30:05

Did you recompile python, if not then the python suppression file is not installed. The patch doesn't update the python version so it is not recompiled automatically.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-10-09 17:38:47

Nope I did not.

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-10-09 22:30:34

Resolution: fixed
