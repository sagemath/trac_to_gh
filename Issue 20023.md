# Issue 20023: p-adic polylogarithms, after Besser-de Jeu

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20260

Original creator: jen

Original creation time: 2016-03-23 13:44:30

CC:  frvillegas caruso kedlaya

Keywords: days71

We plan to add code to compute p-adic polylogarithms, in particular, Li_n, based on the work of Besser and de Jeu ("Li<sup>(p)</sup>-service? An algorithm for computing p-adic polylogarithms").

This has some trailing whitespace that should be removed.

* You must not recreate the parent (by `K = Qp(p,prec)`) but instead write `K = self.parent().fraction_field()` (in order to keep the same modes)
* You should compute once for all `K(self)` and give a name to it
* Why are you using the name `_polylog_c` whereas your function is not written in C
* Is that really useful to have three external functions (namely `_polylog_c`, `_findprec` and `_compute_g`); cannot we instead include them directly in the method `polylog`
* Instead of

```
        for x in K.teichmuller_system():
            if (self - x).valuation() > 0:
                zeta = x
}}} 
you probably should write `zeta = K.teichmuller(x)`.

You should put a real name into the Authors field (so it shows up like that in the change notes.)

Thanks for all the comments caruso, I have made many of the changes you suggested, we discussed this offline but for completeness of the ticket:

Regarding the module functions, they are used in two of the public methods, so they cannot really be moved/removed, and the function _c is so named to be consistent with the paper of Besser-de Jeu I've tried to make that clearer in the docstring.
The way precision works has been made much better, the user no longer specifies a precision instead the best possible is chosen and it is up to the user to change their element to lower precision first if they want quicker evaluation.

Hi Alex,
This doesn't currently merge.

I won't be able to look at this over the weekend, but I'll be at Sage Days 88 next week and should have a chance then.

Hi David, oops, hopefully it's fixed now.
I'm pretty happy with the code right now, I've thrown a lot of tests at it and it looks to be working fine, so when you do get a chance more comments would be great!

Hi Alex, I found a couple typos in your documentation.
 * Rob De Jeu should be Rob de Jeu
 * Computation should be capitalized in Mathematics of Computation
 * Tate should be capitalized. 
 * The year in the citation [DCW2015] should be 2016
 * In the polylog function, 'n'th the should be the `n`th
 * prop 6.1 should be Prop 6.1

Sorry, I have another change.  Everywhere the citation [DCW2016] is referenced, the 2015 needs to be changed to 2016.  In particular:

`2016.17 (2015): 5291-5354.`

should be

`2016.17 (2016): 5291-5354.`

This occurs in two places.

No problem, I like things to be as good/correct as possible!
In this instance I thought about it but was unsure what to do, if we look at https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/2016/17/5291/2451667/Mixed-Tate-Motives-and-the-Unit-Equation?redirectedFrom=fulltext the journal issue is 2016 but date of publication listed as 2015, I don't know much about correct citation styles though.
If you still think it should be 2016 I will make it so!

Hmm.  I was going off MathSciNet:


```
Dan-Cohen, Ishai(D-DUES2M); Wewers, Stefan(D-ULM-IPM)
Mixed Tate motives and the unit equation. (English summary) 
Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2016, no. 17, 5291â€“5354. 
```

MathSciNet is good enough for me, thanks!

I removed some trailing whitespace in the references.

It looks good to me.
