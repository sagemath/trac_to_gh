* You must not recreate the parent (by `K = Qp(p,prec)`) but instead write `K = self.parent().fraction_field()` (in order to keep the same modes)
* You should compute once for all `K(self)` and give a name to it
* Why are you using the name `_polylog_c` whereas your function is not written in C
* Is that really useful to have three external functions (namely `_polylog_c`, `_findprec` and `_compute_g`); cannot we instead include them directly in the method `polylog`
* Instead of

```
        for x in K.teichmuller_system():
            if (self - x).valuation() > 0:
                zeta = x
```
 
you probably should write `zeta = K.teichmuller(x)`.

Thanks for all the comments caruso, I have made many of the changes you suggested, we discussed this offline but for completeness of the ticket:

Regarding the module functions, they are used in two of the public methods, so they cannot really be moved/removed, and the function _c is so named to be consistent with the paper of Besser-de Jeu I've tried to make that clearer in the docstring.
The way precision works has been made much better, the user no longer specifies a precision instead the best possible is chosen and it is up to the user to change their element to lower precision first if they want quicker evaluation.
