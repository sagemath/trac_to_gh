Originally added in #30404, then removed in #32491, now it's back: the pyright check via the github actions.

I've changed the pyright config so that some of the errors are demoted to warnings (all of the demoted errors occurred at least 100 times and thus are not fixable in a single ticket). This made it check now pass on the complete sage source code.

Also fixed a handful of errors that pyright reported:
- Missing closed bracket in smallgraphs by removing leading zeros in the numbers (might actually be a bug in pyright)
- Remove global declaration in `latex`, where pyright complained about global appearing before import. If I understand it correctly, then `global` is not needed here (because `sage_configurable_latex_macros` is not a global variable in the latex module)
- Remove duplicate import in `free_module`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33456

Actually, it is not quite working since pyright complains (at least locally) about missing imports like sage.libs.sirocco, database_knotinfo, gambit, igraph. I think these are all related to optional packages. What's the easiest way to install all optional python packages in the build & test workflow?

I've demoted the reportMissingImports error to a warning for now.

Thanks for the review.

I don't have any problems locally with a "normally" installed pyright. So I guess that's an issue with #30411.
