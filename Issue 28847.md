Yes, this is a different issue. #29071 fixes fflas-ffpack building when using system openblas, but fflas-ffpack configure script still doesn't detect openblas being used (so the generic blas code is compiled, without specific openblas optimizations). This is what this ticket fixes.

Thanks for the explanation. How does one recognize this situation in the logs? 

In https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/32186055 I ran the branch of #29071. See archlinux logs at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/suites/424292952/artifacts/1395949

That build is not using system openblas, because you don't have the Arch cblas package installed - so Sage's openblas is being compiled, in which case this patch doesn't make any difference.

If you have Arch openblas, lapack and cblas packages installed, without this patch fflas-ffpack configure should print

`checking if this is OpenBLAS... no`

and with this patch it should print

`checking if this is OpenBLAS... yes`

Thanks. I have added these packages now to the "standard" configuration by https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=23c6334cf2927a4d917a27b3963471e8242d86a3 in #29053/#29087. Running my GH Actions test runner
on the branch of this ticket (on top of #29051, #29071): https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/32381825, 
`archlinux-latest-standard` no longer decides to build openblas.

Now I see in `fflas-ffpack` config:

```
checking for use of MKL... no 
checking for BLAS... found CBLAS
checking for USER LAPACK... no 
checking if this is OpenBLAS... yes
```


Without the branch of this ticket, i.e., only using #29051, #29071, I indeed see (at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/32381466)

```
checking for BLAS... found CBLAS
checking for USER LAPACK... no 
checking if this is OpenBLAS... no
```

-- like you said. Great!

That's not the case, the output of pkg-config --cflags can be seen in the logs:


```
Using --with-blas-libs='-L/sage/local/lib -lopenblas  ' '--with-blas-cflags=-I/sage/local/include  '
```


That being said, the --cflags change is not needed at all, that change was made simply to be consistent with the --libs line.
