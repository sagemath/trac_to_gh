HMmmmmmm... I try to read and understand how it works, but it does not work for my own use yet. The "raise OSError" which is called when there is a broken link in a page is in custom-sphinx-build.py.

I added a commit for that in public/16100. Is that okay for you ?  If it is I will look again at your commit and review it properly, i.e. try to understand it `:-P`

Well, short of this I agree with the commit. The only thing is that the "if ABORT_ON_ERROR:" added before the raise makes me wonder if anything is displayed when the exception is caught. Not having the exception is cool, thinking that nothing happened is something different `:-P`

And I do not know how to test that.

Unfortunately I have to leave right now, and I may not be near a computer for the next few days...

Thank you very much again, Volker ! I want to keep the links working, and this really helps to track them `:-)`
