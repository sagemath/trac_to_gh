The function `richcmp_by_eq_and_lt` from `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/misc.py` should be moved to `src/sage/structure/richcmp.pyx`.

+1 :)

I think this function should never have been put in `src/sage/rings/asymptotic` in the first place. When you write general functions, they should be put in a general place, not hidden in `src/sage/rings/asymptotic`.

For this reason, most of the contents of `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/misc.py` doesn't belong there. For example, why is `transform_category` not a method of `Category`? Hiding such general functions tends to encourage reinventing the wheel. Maybe people working on a completely different part of Sage need something like `transform_category`. Those people wouldn't know that it exists in `rings/asymptotic`, so they would need to reinvent it. Anyway, I'm not going to deal with that here, only with `richcmp_by_eq_and_lt`.

Question: do you assume a total order? I am asking because you currently implement `x <= y` as `x == y` or `x < y`. But you could also implement it as `not x > y`. This way, you only need one method call for every comparison.

Answering my own question... the example shows that the order is _partial_.

Replying to [comment:8 jdemeyer]:

```
            if equal_types:
                other_eq = getattr(other, eq_attr)
            if other_eq(self):
                return rich_to_bool(op, 0)
```

What is the reason for using `eq_attr` of `other` and never the `eq_attr` attribute of `self`?

It's only for efficiency. If we already know `other_eq`, it's more efficient to use it instead. Python's implementation of rich comparisons assumes that `a == b` is the same as `b == a`, so it shouldn't hurt.

Ok.

1. I think the outer parentheses are not needed in

```
+        cdef bint equal_types = (type(self) is type(other))
```


2. Is there a reason for using `op_LT` and `Py_LT`?

3. Docstring:

```
+    - ``other`` -- arbitrary object. If it does have ``eq_attr`` and
+      ``lt_attr`` methods, those are used for the comparison. Otherwise,
+      the comparison is undefined.
```

`those` vs. `these`. I am not native English speaking, but shoudn't it be the latter?

Apart from these comments; the code looks fine. Let's see what the patchbot says.

I somehow find it strange that the comparision `a == b` is performed by `b` and not `a`...

They are certainly not needed. It's just a style issue: when assigning the result of a comparison-like operator, I find it clearer with the parentheses.

It might be strange but it's not wrong. From [PEP 207](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0207/):

```
    4 The reflexivity rules *are* assumed by Python.  Thus, the
      interpreter may swap y>x with x<y, y>=x with x<=y, and may swap
      the arguments of x==y and x!=y.
```

Ok, clearer is always better ;)

Ok, so let's keep it.

Right, this got broken by the recent changes in #23102.

Thank you for fixing this; LGTM. As soon as the patchbot confirms, this is a positive review from my side.

The previous patchbot report only showed failures in `richcmp.pyx`. I fixed those doctests and did not change any code, so it should be fine. Thanks for the review!
