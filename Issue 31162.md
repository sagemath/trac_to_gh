See my comments on #31464, which I've just marked as depending on this ticket (since the branch there includes the changes in this ticket).  Ideally, you'll update this ticket with the suggestions that are relevant to the `mod` method, then once that's reviewed you can merge the updated version into your branch for #31464.

This seems like an extension of the `change_ring` functionality. We can achieve the same result with `change_ring` as follows:


```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[] 
sage: I = R.ideal(t + 1)
sage: k = ResidueField(I)
sage: F.<t> = FractionField(R)
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(F, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 + t*y^2, y^2])
sage: f.change_ring(k).change_ring(GF(5))
```


Is there a specific use case where `change_ring` isn't sufficient?

Changing component from algebra to dynamics.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
