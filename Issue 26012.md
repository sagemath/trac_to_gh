In FreeBSD 12 the long-standing incompleteness of its libm has been helped. This simplifies a lot, compared to #22679.

We will not try to work around the toolchain [problem related to gfortran/libgcc_s](https://wiki.freebsd.org/libgcc%20problem). Instead, we just [add a line](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208120#c14) at the end of `/etc/libmap.conf` as
follows:

```
libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/local/lib/gcc7/libgcc_s.so.1
```

This scipy [problem](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22679#comment:93) is still there.
(while this works with the system's python2)
It's a matter of comparing the patches used there with what we do in Sage. Perhaps they disable multithreading...

I can give you access to the FreeBSD 12.0 VM I am running on GCE, this would be easier, I guess. (12.0 is still in beta/RC cycle, so installation is not straightforward, you basically need to build it from source).

I think it'd be much better to use the work done on 
#27330 - you don't even need to build a special Python version, but use one on the system!

A large part of #27330 is already in 9.0.
But yes, I think it's much better to wait for 9.1, or actually start using 9.1.betas 
(we're near the first release candidate).

IIRC FreeBSD has quite a few packages available, although they aren't always built
with pre-reqs needed for Sage, e.g. Flint is not built with NTL support.

Some news: I have just updated the WIP-port to 9.1.beta9: it is available at
https://reviews.freebsd.org/D24195

Every possible packages listed in #27330 are used as external packages, thanks for that!

Unfortunately, there remain some problems, mostly caused by staging (DESTDIR): a lot of libraries are referring to the directory where they have been built: e.g.

Error: 'lib/python3.7/site-packages/PIL/_imagingft.so' is referring to /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage
Error: 'lib/libldl.so.2.2.6' is referring to /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage

Is there some possibility to let them refer to relative directories?
How would you set SAGE_LOCAL?

Actually, to be more positive, it mostly works!

Looking for the root of the problem, only 29 libraries are not fully staged - but of course, thereafter the other binaries using one of this library become affected.

I guess that the most problematic case is libsuitesparseconfig.so, which is widely used.

there are many free Common Lisp implementations, I suppose there can be lang/cl as a "main" package with a number of slaves, perhaps SBCL as a standard one.

Thanks! I'm just in discussion with the maintainers of these two ports (ECL and Maxima). Let's check this version.

ecl obviously must be upgraded to the latest release (maxima currently packaged with Sage works well with it, too).

which bugs of maxima one prefers, is another question. :-)

our experience with updating maxima is that each new release has serious regressions.

This is great!

I guess we should make the Sagemath source FreeBSD-friendly, so that one can build
Sage from source using the standard ./configure + make route, right? This would need

* adding data for the needed packages, that is, there should be
  `build/pkgs/*/distros/freebsd.txt` files added with package names.

* adding pre-reqs data: `build/pkgs/freebsd.txt` and `build/pkgs/freebsd-bootstrap.txt`

* import patches you added in FreeBSD to Sage (if any)

I will look at #29653 - it needs a rebase over the latest 9.2.beta1 

regarding testing - is docker ported to FreeBSD?

Anyway, one can set a patchbot, for this one just needs a FreeBSD host that will pull branches and build/test them.

I've revived a VM with FreeBSD, it's running 12.1-RELEASE-p6

How do I get the new port in there? Do I need a system update (if yes, to what?)?
Or it's easier?
I've run portsnap, and still see old stuff for sage in /usr/ports/math/sage.

You did the right thing!

- 12.1-RELEASE-p6 is OK

- `portsnap fetch update' is a well supported method - but I do not know how long it takes to be refreshed. I guess that if you try again is 1h or 2 it should be fine.

I guess there are two possibilities, one is portsnap is not updated yet (unlikely, IIRC it updates hourly), the other is it's tracking quarterly branch, and 9.1 is only in latest branch now.  I haven't used portsnap for a while so I might also be wrong.

To get the latest ports tree in real-time, you can try to use svn to checkout from:

https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head

or git from
