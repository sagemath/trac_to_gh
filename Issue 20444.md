I understand the point of this patch, but I think it's not the right thing to do. The methods you define now in `coercion_methods.pyx` are just copies of methods available in various subclasses of `Element` anyway (e.g. `ModuleElement`, `RingElement`).

I think the right thing to do is just to get rid of the category framework for these arithmetic methods and just define them in `Element`. That will be even faster than the current patch.

(for the record: I just moved that comment which was already there).

Yes, I pondered about that, since we had this parallel discussion
about moving all the coercion methods up to Element. If we do the
move, we should do it for all coercion methods at once. However, given
that this moving is a non trivial API change and still under
discussion, I prefer to postpone it to a later ticket.

We definitely would want to have them appear in the doc of the original classes. But this will only happen when we finally configure Sphinx to include the special methods (which are not private methods!).

For the "coercion_methods" module, it does not really matter.
