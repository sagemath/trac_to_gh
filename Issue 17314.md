Like for previous ones. More links, more lists, more bold text, shorter sentences.

Heey,

one more typo in terms of English grammar favorite -> favourite.

Other than that, I've read through the changes and it looks like you condensed the previous text and made it more clear? 

Do you need any additional specific input about this patch?

Yooooooo !

> one more typo in terms of English grammar favorite -> favourite.
Done.

Yes, nothing more complicated. I am just trying to make several parts of the documentation more concise.

> Do you need any additional specific input about this patch?

No, all that the patch needs now is a positive review `:-P`

Both favourite and favorite are acceptable spellings (British vs. American English, same as colour vs color).

ooh, didn't know that :-O

What I usually do when I am not sure about the spelling is to type the word in google and see if it says "did you mean <corrected version>?"
