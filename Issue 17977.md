Here is a proposal for a solution. In case of inexact base ring, I introduce a non-zero epsilon constant, to take care of approximate equality of points. Maybe this could become a parameter.

I think you also need to change method `PointConfiguration.contained_simplex`.

And that epsilon should indeed be customizable. And when `PointConfiguration` is called from `Polyhedron_RDF`, it should use the epsilons from `Polyhedron_RDF._is_zero` etc.
