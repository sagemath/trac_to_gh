# Issue 21242: ./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21479

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2016-09-12 18:14:49

CC:  jdemeyer embray fbissey leif dimpase

I propose to support choosing a location for the SAGE_LOCAL tree, using 

```
./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL
```

(the default would be, as before, the `local` subdirectory of SAGE_ROOT).

I am fully aware that Sage's build system does not have a separation between 'make' and 'make install' (this would require all packages to support a two-stage install (DESTDIR).) Nevertheless, SAGE_LOCAL should be considered the same as the `prefix` in the sense of the autotools.

(i completely agree with this)

a main obstacle is: the build system writes to $prefix during the build...

i suggest to do the transition one-package-at-a-time, and after `--disable-$package` is in place.

with `--disable-all`, it will be easiest to avoid writing to $prefix.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-09-15 07:26:41

On this *short term* ticket, we do allow "make" to write into $prefix; and "make install" will be a no-op.

More ambitious plans are to be discussed on the *long term* ticket #21495, not on this ticket. Thanks.


---

Comment by felixs created at 2016-09-15 09:49:47

i agree that there are intermediate steps to take. but i don't yet fully understand this approach.

i think the behaviour of just "make" should not change, regardless of `--prefix`. it works perfectly well and *as intended* right now. clearly it should do something different under the hood, but that's not on this ticket.

> we do allow "make" to write into $prefix

why would you need/want that? can you please give an example?

my feeling is, that entangling prefix and SAGE_LOCAL further complicates the transition considerably. there will be no way to tell whether "this part still uses SAGE_LOCAL" vs. "this has already been cleaned". newcomers tend to grep a variable from the code, see how it is used and use it the same way. for a looong time to come.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-09-15 11:08:17

I made a new ticket (#21501) to allow `$SAGE_LOCAL` to be changed.

`@`mkoeppe i've thought about it. it seems, the alternatives are much worse (#21501) or much more ambitious.

please go ahead with prefix==SAGE_LOCAL.

please consider to add a remark in some documentation (better place: `configure --help`?) on this temporary sort of prefix, such as 

"currently, `make install` is a no-op, that will change (hopefully). you should not expect a fully functional installation in $prefix before `make install` has finished."

Thanks Felix for the discussion. 

If you want to help, could you work on rebasing #15105.

Here's a first version of what I have in mind.

Some concerns:
 - bootstrap. It's somewhat unclear what to do here. By the way, is it supposed to use the distribution's Python or ours?
 - sage-location.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-09-18 11:09:50

I don't like the duplication in `build/make/install` and `src/bin/sage-env`.

Here is a suggestion: add a new file, say `src/bin/sage-config` (or whatever you want to call it) to deal with configurable things like `SAGE_LOCAL`. You can also define the other `SAGE_*` directories (except `SAGE_ROOT`) there.

Then you can source this file in both `src/bin/sage-env` and `build/make/install`, which can then be independent of `configure`.

And I don't see the point of changing `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` because that is additional duplication.

In both cases, I don't get what the problem is.

Thanks for the suggestion. 
The ticket is indeed simpler that way.
Please take a look.

Just to answer this question: the `bootstrap` package is intended to use the system Python (after all, it's needed well before Sage's Python is ever built).

What does this comment mean:

```
## The first test does not actually work (see above).
```

("see above" can be really confusing because you don't know where to look.

Comments like these don't belong in the sources but in a Trac ticket:

```
	# TODO: Making directories in $prefix
	# should be done by 'make', not configure.
```


```
# TODO: Should the install hierarchy (local) really be deleted by make distclean?
```


```
#SAGE_ENV_DIR=`dirname $0`    ### Does not work. $0 is /bin/bash
```


```
## Note this is a bashism, not sure if this is allowed in this file.
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-10-26 22:05:38

Then a more serious remark: I doubt that you are using `BASH_SOURCE` correctly. From the `bash` man page:

```
       BASH_SOURCE
              An array variable whose members are the source filenames where the corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable  are
              defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is defined in the file ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.
```


At the very least, I need more explanation of why your code does the right thing.

It's referring to `dirname $0` -- which does not give the location of sage-env but rather /bin/bash. This is because sage-env is sourced (.) rather than executed.

Note this is existing code in `sage-env` which simply never worked.

BASH_SOURCE[0] gives the source of the "currently running function". See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html (you need to read the entries for FUNCNAME and BASH_SOURCE).

Don't tell *me* but tell the person reading `sage-env` (i.e. clarify the comment in the file).

This is just because you write `SAGE_LOCAL` instead of `"$SAGE_LOCAL"`.

When you fix this, I suggest to squash the commits to one commit and rebase to `7.5.beta1`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 13:37:49

The file `sage-env-config` needs to be ignored by `.gitignore` and deleted when running `make distclean`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 13:54:03

This line in `sage` needs quoting:

```
. $SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config
```

And since you're running `bash` anyway, you might as well use `source` instead of `.` which is more visible.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 13:54:55

And do you really need this:

```
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: $SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config could not be read"
fi
```

The shell will already write an error message, no need for an additional message.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 13:55:44

I also think that determining `$SAGE_LOCAL` should be done _after_

```
# If this is a freshly-unpacked binary tarball then run the installer
# Note: relocate-once.py deletes itself upon successful completion
if [ -x "$SAGE_ROOT/relocate-once.py" ]; then
    "$SAGE_ROOT/relocate-once.py"
fi
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 13:59:16

Can you explain under which circumstances it is needed to read `sage-env-config` from `sage-env`? It seems to me that `sage-env-config` would already be read, either by the top-level `sage` script or by `build/make/install`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-04 14:00:25

It is good style to start all error messages with `Error:` and write them to stderr. `build/make/install` doesn't do that.

`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` becomes directly executable; one does not have to go through that top-level script.

Then let me turn the question around: why do you need to change `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-11-07 11:20:09

I'm still not entirely convinced that `BASH_SOURCE[0]` really does what we want. Why not use `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config`?

Or maybe we should just source both `sage-env-config` and `sage-env` from `src/bin/sage`?

Things installed in SAGE_LOCAL definitely should not depend on the source directory.

That would be possible. There might be a few more places though that need to source the extra file.

`$SAGE_ROOT/sage` sources `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config` so that it works when nothing has been installed so far.

I retract my comment.

I have removed this code from `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`.
(Also rebased on latest beta.)

I think I wouldn't like to change this on this ticket. There are indeed a few places that source sage-env: `build/bin/sage-spkg`, `build/make/deps`, `src/bin/sage-update-src`. Probably not so nice if we have to change all of them.

I realized that this is not entirely true. `sage-env` contains some code for discovering SAGE_ROOT when it is not set, but that code fails if $SAGE_LOCAL is not a direct subdirectory of $SAGE_ROOT. 
I suppose I could add the definition of SAGE_ROOT to sage-env-config. 
But that could go on a follow-up ticket as well.

I gather it's to resolve some chicken vs egg problem with autotools hosted by Sage itself.


---

That's right. As the comment in `setup_bootstrap_env` explains, bootstrap needs to work both pre-build and post-build.

Do you expect `sage-env-config` to be installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`? Currently, that's a bit random, depending on whether or not `src/bin/sage-env-config` exists when running `./configure`.

Personally, I think that it should _not_ be installed for an obvious reason: in order to find `sage-env-config`, you need to know `SAGE_LOCAL`, for which you need to source `sage-env-config`, for which you need to find `sage-env-config`...

Given that it should not be installed, a better place might be `build/bin/sage-env-config` instead of `src/bin/sage-env-config`.

And then you might as well drop the whole complicated stuff to figure out the directory of `sage-env` and just use `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-env-config`.

If you agree, I could implement this.

Yes, it should be installed.

> Personally, I think that it should _not_ be installed for an obvious reason: in order to find `sage-env-config`, you need to know `SAGE_LOCAL`, for which you need to source `sage-env-config`, for which you need to find `sage-env-config`...

`sage-env-config` is intended as a place for more variables defined by `configure`, to be used by $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage. ($SAGE_LOCAL is just the first one that uses this file.) This is why it should be installed. 

The idea is that `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` would be able to work without having to go through the script `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` (and without depending on `$SAGE_ROOT` being set). As I realized in comment 68 above, it does not quite work yet -- because `sage-env` still tries to discover SAGE_ROOT. 
A complete solution would be to add a line that sets `SAGE_ROOT` to `sage-bin-config` as well.
If this sounds agreeable, I could do this.

> Given that it should not be installed, a better place might be `build/bin/sage-env-config` instead of `src/bin/sage-env-config`.

See #21707 for a discussion regarding a distinction between build-time and run-time config variables; but I think SAGE_LOCAL (and SAGE_ROOT) should be defined in src/bin/sage-env-config (and installed in SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config).

> And then you might as well drop the whole complicated stuff to figure out the directory of `sage-env` and just use `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-env-config`.

In the end, anything that moves this ticket forward is fine with me. But note there is more work planned that depends on this -- in particular #21469 (Enable VPATH builds).

Personally, I think it's reasonable to ask for either `SAGE_ROOT` or `SAGE_LOCAL` to be defined.

I disagree; a main goal of this ticket is so that one can install into a prefix hierarchy that can just be used normally (in particular without depending on some environment variables).

Let me clarify: `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` should not require `SAGE_ROOT` or `SAGE_LOCAL` to be set because `sage-env` can determine it. I'm mainly talking about the logic to determine `sage-env-config`: I think there we already know either `SAGE_ROOT` or `SAGE_LOCAL` so we can simplify that.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2017-03-14 20:44:40

Thanks for the clarification; I agree that the installed `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` would be able to determine `SAGE_LOCAL`. But it would have to read `$SAGE_ROOT` from `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config`.
And the non-installed `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` would be able to determine SAGE_ROOT, but would have to read SAGE_LOCAL from somewhere (currently `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-env-config`).
If you'd like to implement something like this, please go ahead.

> That's right. As the comment in `setup_bootstrap_env` explains, bootstrap needs to work both pre-build and post-build.

For bootstrap, why not just try to source `sage-env` and ignore any errors? I feel like the current solution is over-engineered: in the case where you want to use autotools from `$SAGE_LOCAL`, the file `sage-env-config` will exist. So the current code in `bootstrap` is a complicated work-around for a non-existing problen.

I agree that this is a simpler solution for the purposes of this ticket.
(`setup_bootstrap_env` was unnecessarily ambitious -- it set up a cleaner build environment without all the settings that `sage-env` does)

I've had a look and it looks good to me.  It might be nice in the future to properly support other standard `configure` options like `--bindir` and `--libdir`, but that's a separate issue.

I agree. Could you open a ticket for it? Note that it would require more invasive patching (or autotoolization) of many spkgs that are not autotools-based.

The problem is that this comment is wrong:

```
    # Try to get autotools from our own package into PATH (Trac #21214)
    # This will fail for initial bootstrap, when sage-env-config has
    # not been created yet.
```

It's not just about autotools, it's also about getting `sage-download-file` in the `$PATH`.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2017-04-13 18:47:18

As a consequence of this ticket, with a fresh tarball or after running `make distclean`, `./sage -i PKG` fails, as does `./sage --sh`. The error message says

```
Error: You must set either the SAGE_LOCAL or SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR environment variable to run this
Error setting environment variables by sourcing '/Users/palmieri/Desktop/TEMP/sage-8.0.beta1/src/bin/sage-env';
possibly contact sage-devel (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel).
```

Should these commands work out of the box? Running `./configure` fixes this, I think, so should the error message be changed, at least?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2017-04-13 20:06:26

I think its reasonable to ask that one runs at least configure once before trying to launch any scripts in the source tarball. So +1 for changing the error message...
