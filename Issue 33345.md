# Issue 33345: clean up docstring formatting in schemes/elliptic_curves/

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33582

Original creator: lorenz

Currently, in the elliptic-curves codebase, there are quite a few occurrences of the following formatting quirks:

- Lines indented by `4n-1` instead of `4n` spaces.
- Non-standard use of `-` and `--` in input/output lists.
- Lowercase `.. note::` or `.. warning::` blocks, and occasional use of `AUTHOR:` instead of `AUTHORS:`.
- Excessive empty lines.

This patch makes an attempt at cleaning up these things somewhat.

LGTM. (I also checked that this does not conflict with #33576).
