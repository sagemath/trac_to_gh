# Issue 22460: Modularity of elliptic curves

Keywords: modularity

By a famous Theorem, all elliptic curves over QQ are modular.  By a more recent Theorem of Freitas, Le Hung and Siksek, all elliptic curves over real quadratic fields are modular, and over any totally real number field there is a quite simple condition to check which ensures modularity (this uses additional work of Chen and Thorne).

Siksek has provided me with a Magma implementation of this criterion, which I will translate into Sage so that for all elliptic curves E over any number field, E.is_modular() will return True or (hopefully not) False, or raise a NotImplementedError if the base field is not totally real.  This will be very quick if the field has degree 1 or 2 or is not totally real.

Note: For fields which are not totally real, it is possible in principle to prove modularity only over imaginary quadratic fields, given our current state of knowledge, and even in that case is very hard work.

Already five years old. Is there some code somewhere ?

Yes somewhere... I'll look for it. It will raise NotImplemented if the base field is not totally real.
