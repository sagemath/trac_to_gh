Install the PARI spkg from #14539:

```
./sage -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.5.4.p0.spkg
```

Then rebuild the library:

```
./sage -b
```

Before #13031, this used to rebuild all files depending on PARI (good!), with #13031 absolutely nothing happens (bad!).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14544

It's not that closed in fact : what does deps.patch do? It isn't documented in SPKG.txt, and the log message only says who wrote it but not why. And since it is an upstream modification, was it forwarded?
