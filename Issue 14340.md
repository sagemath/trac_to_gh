# Issue 14340: Cython dependency checking broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14544

Original creator: jdemeyer

Install the PARI spkg from #14539:

```
./sage -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.5.4.p0.spkg
```

Then rebuild the library:

```
./sage -b
```

Before #13031, this used to rebuild all files depending on PARI (good!), with #13031 absolutely nothing happens (bad!).

This requires a fix to the Sage library as well as https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/5574592e569e0cce5f1277b6f0c441d6d19122b5

It's not that closed in fact : what does deps.patch do? It isn't documented in SPKG.txt, and the log message only says who wrote it but not why. And since it is an upstream modification, was it forwarded?

The author of the patch *is* upstream. Anyway, #14569 solved your problem.
