CC:  fhivert

When generating the documentation *from the exact same sources*, sometimes links
appear as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual: Utilities v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```
and sometimes as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```
and it's not clear why this happens.

The changes make sense and the docs build. I don't know how to reproduce the cited problem, though, so I can't confirm that the changes fix it. Suggestions about where I could look?

Two questions: is this ready for review? And is the intention to not have "Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5" but only "Sage Reference Manual: $SUBDOC v6.9.beta5"? That's what I'm seeing, and it sounds like that's what you want from your previous remark, but I wanted to make sure.
