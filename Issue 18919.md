# Issue 18919: Docbuilder undeterministic

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19156

When generating the documentation _from the exact same sources_, sometimes links
appear as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual: Utilities v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```

and sometimes as

```
<a title="(in Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5)">sage.misc.lazy_import</a>
```

and it's not clear why this happens.

The changes make sense and the docs build. I don't know how to reproduce the cited problem, though, so I can't confirm that the changes fix it. Suggestions about where I could look?

You can grep the generated html documentation in `src/doc/output/html` for the string `(in Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5)`. The instances where it used to occur will be replaced by `(in Sage Reference Manual: $SUBDOC v6.9.beta5)` for some value of `$SUBDOC`.

Two questions: is this ready for review? And is the intention to not have "Sage Reference Manual v6.9.beta5" but only "Sage Reference Manual: $SUBDOC v6.9.beta5"? That's what I'm seeing, and it sounds like that's what you want from your previous remark, but I wanted to make sure.

I still have to test myself.

Yes, I want `Sage Reference Manual: $SUBDOC v6.9.beta5`
