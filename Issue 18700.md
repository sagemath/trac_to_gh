Yes, under the condition that the patchbot can be easily installed from the sources (which is the case currently, just copy/symlink the whole directory).

If (for whatever reason) the installation procedure needs to become more complicated, that complexity should go to an install script inside the sources, not to `spkg-install`. It should not become a *requirement* to use Sage's `spkg-install` to install the patchbot.

Ok, here is a version without need for pytz. It still needs dateutil, but it would be hard
to do without anything to handle timezones..

This is not working in python3, because of encoding problems. Still I think it would be good to have a recent patchbot in the new style spkg.

This patchbot has not yet been run on a ticket.

* Ok, I will remove the dependency on six.

* What should I put in the build/pkgs/patchbot/dependencies ? This is not explained in the doc

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html

It is not clear to me if I should write there shell commands, python packages, or both.

* Concerning the safe-only mode, this is certainly not perfect. I guess its main aim is to avoid the horribly long recompilation that can take place sometimes when some low-level things are changed. Patchbot users are always free to change the default setting. It is up to them to decide whether or not they test all the tickets, including some that may take a **lot** of time.

True, the documentation is lacking. For the patchbot, I think there are no dependencies, so something like

```
# No dependencies
```

should be fine.

If that is the reason, the name `safe_only` looks badly chosen: it seems to imply that testing other tickets is "unsafe" somehow.

Personally, I would prefer to have `safe_only=False` by default. I think that most patchbots are running all the time, so I don't see the problem.

In fact, there is a **big** difference between datetime.utcnow() and datetime.now(tzutc())

* `datetime.utcnow()` does not have any information about its timezone
* `datetime.now(tzutc())` is an object that knows that it is in UTC timezone

Because I want to take differences between times, the clean way is to make pretty sure
that all datetimes are aware of their own timezones.

Given the nature of the patchbot, which is to receive and compare data from all over the world, I think there is no point in trying to get rid of the dateutil package.

For those who install the patchbot? Come on, who installs that except developpers? If they get a message saying that "X must be installed" they will install it, and that's it.

To install mine I had to fight for days, create an user account only for the patchbot, fight with ccache... Having a system dependency like that really isn't a problem (if an explicit error message appears).

Or, alternatively, remove the artificial dependency on `dateutil`.

I still find it hard to believe that something as trivial as a patchbot needs to deal with timezones (and, if you look at the code, it doesn't actually deal with different timezones). You could just assume all times to be in UTC, problem solved.

Ok, here is a new version, again (I am starting to get tired to work on a patchbot that nobody uses).

It does no longer depends on dateutil.

It has a better log in history.txt for skipped tickets.

The doc plugin has been reactivated, and the initial "make" replaced by "make build".
So the doc is only build once, and doc failure is reported as a plugin failure.

I have tested it, it seems to work. Please double-check.

Hmm, there is a problem:

A) either we do not build the doc before running the tests, and the tests fail when a new sage-release appears
(this is what happens with 2.4.7, I think, see your reports on ticket 0)

B) or we do build the doc before, but then there is no plugin reporting about doc failure
(this would revert to the previous behaviour)

C) or we can build the doc twice..

D) or find a better solution (do make when a new develop is pulled ?)

I would vote for B) or D)

In the current state, the plugin ￼"plugins.docbuild" is indeed mandatory, otherwise the doc is not build and therefore the tests do not pass.

Some time ago, the doc was build once with a "make" and then again in the optional "docbuild" plugin. Now it is only build once in the plugin.

I can enforce in the code that the plugin "docbuild" is always activated.

OR I can step back and build the doc during the initial "make" call. But then doc failure will be again reported as Build failure, and the "docbuild" plugin will again become useless.

Opinions are required, please.

I find it very annoying that some tests do not pass if the doc is not build.
