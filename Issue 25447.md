The FGP_module class allows the user to define a list of generators. 
But does not provide any functionality. Internally it computes (and prints) with respect to the smith form generators. This should implement some way to go back and forth between both generating systems.

- Note that no assumption is put on the generators except, that they should generate the module.
- We can implement this over `ZZ` and raise a `NotImplementedError` else.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25684

Even though I know it is only used internally, it is still a good practice to make the resulting matrix immutable for ``@`cached_method` to better prevent bugs.

Also, doc typos: `:meth:`to_smith`` -> `:meth:`_to_smith`` and `:meth:``gens``` -> `:meth:`gens``.

Do we want `_to_smith` and `_to_gens` to be hidden? I don't have any expertise in this area, but it seems like something that would be useful to the end-user and should be in the API.
