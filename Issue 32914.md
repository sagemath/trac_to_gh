... contrary to what is claimed in the README in https://pypi.org/project/sage-conf/9.5rc0/

```
$ (cd $(/Users/mkoeppe/Library/Python/3.10/bin/sage-config SAGE_ROOT) && make build-venv)
...
make[3]: *** No rule to make target `/Users/mkoeppe/.sage/sage-9.5.rc0-Darwin-x86_64/pkgs/sage-conf/bin/sage-env-config', needed by `/Users/mkoeppe/.sage/sage-9.5.rc0-Darwin-x86_64/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10/var/lib/sage/installed/sage_conf-9.5.rc0'.  Stop.
