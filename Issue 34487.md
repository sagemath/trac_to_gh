of course, but why such  sloppy coding in `echelonize()` ? It literally reads as "we care about p-adics, the rest can go and die from numerical instability hell" :-)

`​numerical_inverse` must be dog-slow. (convert data to ball arithmetics, call mpmath to do LU, convert back...)
In general, one should do SVD for inverting, this seems to be the best for badly conditioned data.

I think I ended up with and LUP decomposition because there was easy code accessible for that, whereas SVD was harder to find and/or required more complex interfacing to be written to arrive at an inverse. It's really more a tie-over until we have truly well-performing and fairly stable numerical inversion.

I mainly pointed out the ad-hoc routine because I suspect these occur in other parts of sagemath as well. The current routine seems to have been stable enough (these matrices tend to not be super-badly conditioned; it's just that classical pivoting tends to be unstable even for well-conditioned matrices) and not a choke point for performance. But if we end up with something more reliable and more performant it will be worth adapting it!

The idea of using a heuristic to decide on the default pivoting strategy seems good to me. I'm not sure that the proposed heuristic is the right one. For instance, the proposed one would also use `scaled_partial_pivoting` on `QQ` and I'm not sure that's desirable (it's certainly a change that's outside the scope of this ticket).

Alternatives I can think of:
- use category framework on the base ring to find out what to do (I wasn't able to find an apprpriate property there
- have a property or a method on the parent that provides a default -- if that fails, fall back on the old strategy.
- have a subclassing mechanism to provide appropriate echelonization approaches (the category framework with its "axiom"s does that, but I'm not sure if that's an appropriate mechanism for matrices).

I would lean to the second approach as striking a reasonable balance between explicit intent in the code and avoiding overengineering. In this case, `RealField` and `ComplexField` would grow a method `_matrix_pivoting_strategy` that just returns `scaled_partial_pivoting`. Introduction of such default preference expressions could grow slowly, as needed and it limits behaviour changes to those cases where it's explicitly desired.

It would be appealing to communicate an actual callable instead of a string indicating a choice elsewhere, but that might complicate the design and introduce circular imports.

It's not clear how to deal with SR matrices (SR is not exact, but we can only do classic echelonize on it) like this, as SR is split out to its own package, and
so checking whether the base ring is SR directly doesn't seem to be possible, due to this structure - as importing SR is no good.

So further subclassing (?) seems hard to aviod - any ideas?

while working on it I found a juicy test bug in `pseudoinverse` for an `RR` matrix `M`.
The pseudoinverse in the docstring, computed with `M.pseudoinverse(algorithm="exact")`,
is very bad quality, compared to `M.pseudoinverse(algorithm="numpy")`. I'm changing this test to a meaningful one.

> So further subclassing (?) seems hard to aviod - any ideas?
For SR the subclassing has already happened:

```
sage: M=matrix(SR,2,2,[1,0,0,1])
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense.Matrix_symbolic_dense'>
```

so a stub `echelonize` implementation on `Matrix_symbolic_dense` with a different default and then just chains to the `echelonize` on super would do the trick.

Alternatively, we could have a class attribute on matrix types that gives the default echelonization algorithm and then just inherit or override it on the subclass.

For RR and CC the subclassing hasn't happened yet, so there we don't have a chance of overriding the default. But then the `is_exact()` heuristic is pretty good.

I think most performant matrix types would need an `echelonize` that is specific to the type of matrix, so I expect most of them to NOT chain. Indeed, for matrices over QQ there's a specific routine with its specific slew of algorithms and defaults.

I'd say a straightforward guide going forward is: if you need `echelonize` to behave differently (for instance, make it have a different default), then override it and possibly chain into super if you don't mind the penalty.

The generic default depending on `is_exact` is just a matter of being nice and reducing the cases where an override is required (in this case it delays the need to subclass for `RR, CC, RealBall, ComplexBall, RealDouble` etc.)

The alternative of having a class attribute encoding the default is not very robust, especially in the face of possible method overrides on subclasses. I dislike promoting solutions that increase call depth, but in this case I think an extra layer of indirection using exactly the tools that python offers for it gives a clean and at the moment fairly easily implemented solution.

There is numerical noise in tests, mostly pointing at better quality of linear algebra.
E.g. in `riemann_surface` there is `numerical_inverse`, and the doctest saying

```
sage: max(abs(c) for c in (C^(-1)*C-C^0).list()) < 1e-10
False
```


But now it's almost as good and `numerical_inverse`:


```
sage: max(abs(c) for c in (numerical_inverse(C)*C-C^0).list())
2.37143742013377e-16
sage: max(abs(c) for c in (C^(-1)*C-C^0).list())
4.71027737605132e-16
