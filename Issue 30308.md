# Issue 30308: A 1-dimensional polytope has no edge

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30545

Original creator: vpilaud

Keywords: polytopes

The graph of a polytope is constructed in the method graph() using pairs of vertices satisfying common inequalities of the inequalities list. This cannot work in dimension 1 :


```
sage: polytopes.simplex(1).graph().edges()
[]
```

Vincent, tu utilises quelle version de sage ? Ca marche pour moi dans la version 9.2.beta12.


```
sage: polytopes.simplex(1).graph().edges()                                      
[(A vertex at (0, 1), A vertex at (1, 0), None)]
```

I cannot reproduce this either.

by the way, I see bouncing emails from trac to vinc.pilaud`@`...
(they seem to be notifications on this ticket).

Please alert vpilaud.

Yours, postmaster :-)

I had that on version 9.0 and was too lazy to update. So nevermind.
I took the opportunity to update my email address on track.

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Two ways to solve this ticket:

- add a doctest for that (is there already one?)
- or set to duplicate/invalid/wontfix

Cheap ways to check whether something is fixed
in a more recent Sage version than you have:

- the [SageCell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org)
  usually runs the last stable version of Sage
  (currently Sage 9.1)
  - [SageCell: Edges of 1-dimensional polytope](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwtzj0OwjAMBeC9p7DUJRlIqKALOyeAC1itSSLyp9hCcHtStavfe588wgMdwbPhAhKWNwlczvN1Hka4r44YygsQptMaEmUOJWOEWuJPSqXe8SKVb9ZK3xvuUkLxpjRnd8zu2FBbyKI-1DZCaX0cdE8OjA2HVCN91aSNa1i90oa2F5T-A2YuNlw=&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==)

- The main [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) instance
  has a lot of Sage versions installed, including
  the last few stable versions, and usually
  a recent enough development version.

This can help decide whether to upgrade.
