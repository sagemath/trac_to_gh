I made a few changes, but I kept the solve function, which is now part of the code, in that method because it currently used a few things from the method and I don't know of a good place to put it. At least, I would want to put it in the multivariate code, but then we would need to implement a univariate. Plus, we would need a reasonable method name. So because of this, I figured it would be best to postpone that for a later date.

For the discriminant downstairs, we might use the following algorithm:

compute which monomials might appear as we already do and then interpolate by evaluating at random points.
