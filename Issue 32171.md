green bot, please review

You probably could get a little more speed out by

```diff
-return sum(self.basis()[u1 + u] for u in shuffle(r1, w2, False))
+B = self.basis()
+return sum(B[u1 + u] for u in shuffle(r1, w2, False))
```


Although CFM should implement a custom `_sum_of_monomials` (or maybe a `sum_of_monomials`) method and we should call that which avoids creating so many transient objects... However, that is beyond the scope of this ticket.

Tiny speedup available, if it helps:

```diff
-            return (Words10(reverse_w, check=False), (-1)**len(w) * cf)
+            return (Words10(reverse_w, check=False),
+                    -cf if len(w) % 2 else cf)
```

Voilà. Thanks for the suggestions.

Can  you quantify the speedup?

Before

```
sage: x=Multizeta(3)**2                                                                                                                     
sage: %timeit x**2                                                                                                                          
1.13 s ± 25 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

and after

```
sage: x=Multizeta(3)**2                                                         
sage: %timeit x**2                                                              
1.05 s ± 1.89 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Patchbots happy, me too...
Travis, ok for green light?
