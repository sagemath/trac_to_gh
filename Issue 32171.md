You probably could get a little more speed out by

```diff
-return sum(self.basis()[u1 + u] for u in shuffle(r1, w2, False))
+B = self.basis()
+return sum(B[u1 + u] for u in shuffle(r1, w2, False))
```


Although CFM should implement a custom `_sum_of_monomials` (or maybe a `sum_of_monomials`) method and we should call that which avoids creating so many transient objects... However, that is beyond the scope of this ticket.
