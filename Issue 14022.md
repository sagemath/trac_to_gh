There are a fair number of places that does stuff with the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed`, so let's add an environment variable for this directory. This will help ease the transition to git.

The patch looks fine as a quick solution.

In general though, I think that this directory shouldn't be needed from different places at all. There should be two functions (or shell scripts, or ./sage options) like set_installed(name, bool) and is_installed(name) that know about how installation status is tracked, and only they are allowed to know about this directory.

There are also instances in the Sage scripts repository (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/`) which have to get fixed, e.g. in
`sage-update`:

```python
    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```


Same in `sage-list-packages`:

```python
try:
     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))
except OSError:
     installed = set([])
```


There are presumably even more, but simple grepping yields false positives as well; I've found:

```
local/bin/sage-bdist:   cp $CP_OPT installed "$TMP/$PKGDIR/"

local/bin/sage-list-packages:     installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, 'installed')))

local/bin/sage-update:    installed = set(os.listdir(os.path.join(SPKG_ROOT, "installed")))
```


Looking at those, isn't `SPKG_INST` (or `SAGE_SPKG_INST`) a better name? ;-)

Or, how does `make INST="${SAGE_SPKG_INST:-installed}"` behave?  (I think this would be better.)

I meant just in the `Makefile`.  (`$SAGE_SPKG_INST` could still be absolute.)

> The problem with a relative path is that then there are issues if using `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` from some other directory (which can and does happen)

See above.

> `sage-make_relative` isn't available upon the first usage of `deps`.

I was just kidding.

> Making a symbolic link would work in the case that `$(INST) != $SAGE_SPKG_INST`.

Well, just change `INST = installed` to something else (`INST = this_is_always_the_relative_path_to_a_symlink`), and let it point to either `installed` or `$SAGE_SPKG_INST` (where the latter is absolute).  Not sure about performance issues.

Yes, this resolves the issue -- which was that any entry of the form `$(MAKE) $(INST)/$(SPKG)` would error out complaining about a missing target.

After deep thinking...


```sh
make INST="`echo ${SAGE_SPKG_INST:-installed} | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g'`"
```

(without changes to `deps`).


I think this should solve all issues.

I'd keep the "default" value of `INST` in `deps`.

Also, I think there's more than one instance of `$MAKE` in `spkg/install`, not sure whether also elsewhere.

ok, made your suggested changes.

Testing locally I found no difference when introducing whitespace in the directory name of `SAGE_SPKG_INST`, but I have a very recent version of gmake installed on my system.
