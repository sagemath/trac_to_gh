```

With 3.2.3:
- on 64bit, the build was OK and self-tests lead to 1 error (CTestTestUpload)
- on 32bit, the build failed at configure time

With 3.8.0:
- on 64bit, the build is OK and self-tests lead to 2 errors (CTestTestUpload and RunCMake.ctest_submit), but the second test did not exist on 3.2.3.
- on 32bit, the build is OK and 7 self-tests failed out of 442 (98% tests passed)

So, regarding GNU/Linux, the state of this package is strictly better than before.

However, i had to remove the `osx10.10.patch` patch since it does not apply anymore. So, if you have access to such machines, please have a look to OSX builds.

Since sage is changing the compiler to clang on OSX, the patch is not needed at all.

I was trying to find the origin of the `192.0.2.0` address in the cmake test suite. It is not in the source code. cmake does something weird with its test suite. At some point it links one of the sub-folders in the `Tests` to the `Applications` folder on the mac. In my case one of the App in `Applications` is libreoffice.

This is just bizarre. 

I'll clean `spkg-install` there is other stuff in there like `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` that may have been an early attempt at fixing some stuff (or needed to be used with the patch) that has no business here.

Sorry for the delay, i had the exact same commit, so it is fine for me, except that i let the `unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, since i am not sure whether it is still useful.

Also, looking at the `bootstrap` script, i was wondering whether we should add `xz` as a dependency and add the `--system-liblzma` option. Does this makes sense ?
