For some people `^C` does work, but in any case, there should be no long computation involved. We give a basis, so we should get an answer right away.
Indeed, the following does work:

```
sage: Om = magma(L).MaximalOrder()
```


Since others cannot reproduce the `^C` problem, I'm marking this as an "enhancement" for speeding up order creation.

Marco, just to confirm that CTRL-C really does not work for you: press CTRL-C *just once* and wait a long time (say, 1 hour, just to exaggerate). Do you not get a proper traceback?

Also, please mention the version of Sage.

Changing type from enhancement to defect.

I tried again with a fresh sage-5.10.rc2 on my mac 10.6.8. The first few times, CTRL-C did nothing (pressed it, waited an hour, then pressed it again and waited half an hour more, then killed the process). Then a few times CTRL-C did work (instantly). It seems random.

Before, I thought for a while that #14523 was the cause (I had a clear correlation, but with a small sample size). But since I never patched my new 5.10.rc2 with that, I obviously have the problem also without #14523.

When CTRL-C does not work, I see `^C`. Only once I got "`Exception KeyboardInterrupt in <function remove at 0x102ad6d70> ignored`".
