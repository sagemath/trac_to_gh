Completely remove `Element._richcmp`. Instead, add new a function (not a method of `Element`!) `coerce_richcmp()` which replaces the different-parents case of `_richcmp`.

These are not equivalent

```
-            elif PyInt_CheckExact(right):
+            elif isinstance(right, int):
```

As far as I understand, `PyInt_Check` is equivalent to `isinstance(., int)` and `PyInt_CheckExact` is equivalent to `type(.) is int`. Why did you change them in this ticket?

Why are there both a `richcmp` in `class CoercionModel_cache_maps` and `class CoercionModel`? Moreover, in the latter it is undocumented.

First of all, it's cleaner to write pure Python code than using Python C/API calls (and in this case, it's equally fast). The reason I chose `isinstance(...)` instead of `type(...) is ...` is simply because the former is usually the right thing to do. In Python, checking equality of types is not normally done.

For `CoercionModel` it is good as it is.

Both are equally fast (and very fast).

I guess so, since it will be converted to an `Integer` anyway by the coercion framework. So, the `instance()` check is really just a fast path for that.

I don't have a particular use-case. However, given the comments above, I think that `isinstance()` is the right thing to do.
