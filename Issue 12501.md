# Issue 12501: remove sage.media.wav, since it is totally undoctested, and evidently full  of confusing bugs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12673

As I think http://480.sagenb.org/home/pub/137/ amply illustrates, the mere existence of the untested and very buggy module sage.media.wav causes more confusion than it is worth for now.  It would be best to remove it from Sage, and only add something back as a result of a new (probably student) project to do things right.

Alternatively, doctest the code.  I've attached a patch to delete it, but maybe that is too draconian.

This is (very tangentially) related to #7668 and [this interact by Marshall](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#Hearingatrigonometricidentity).

Given that it's not the worst to eventually have easy-to-use wave handling, perhaps it would be appropriate to split the difference between doctesting and deleting.   Could one simply comment out all the code and raise (doctested?) `NotImplementedError`s for everything here?

I've changed my mind.  I think that we should just replace this by some really nice documentation about how to use the `wave` module, given [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/3-Y1RUFkq14) and [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2542/sound-how-is-it-done).  What would be appropriate to roughly replace this stuff with?

Are there no doctests at all that will get confused here?  Maybe we should add _one_ along the lines of the ones in sage.finance.

There was not a single doctest. Now there is one.

It was definitely the wild wild west in those days.  

Thanks, and sorry to override Travis' review :) I will assume patchbot will be happy and restore his assessment.

Don't worry about it at all. We are a community with different options, and we as a collective should agree about positive reviews.
