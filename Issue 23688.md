# Issue 23688: Bulk fix of signal handling in symbolics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-09-25 06:43:15

In Sage-8.1.beta6 this crashes:

```
sage: (x/(x^1431655765-1)).normalize()
Exception (FLINT memory_manager). Unable to allocate memory.
```

while the underlying operation only aborts with `RuntimeError`:

```
gcd(x,x^1431655765-1)
```


The `normalize` member function is one of many where signals from underlying layers are not caught. Let's do a sweeping fix of them in this ticket.

Don't put Python code inside `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` blocks.

What you are doing is essentially

```
sig_on()
try:
    initialize()
    res = c_lib_call()
    return process(res)
finally:
    sig_off
```

Instead, it should be

```
initialize()
sig_on()
res = c_lib_call()
sig_off()
return process(res)
```

...or, if C++ exceptions can occur, it should be:

```
initialize()
sig_on()
try:
    res = c_lib_call()
finally:
    sig_off()
return process(res)
```

After thinking about it a bit more... `pynac` is partially implemented in Python, right? So maybe these should be added upstream in Pynac, not in Sage.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 07:54:18

Pynac is completely C++ but calls some Python C API functions. Is there a C function `sig_on`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-09-25 08:09:16

In theory, `cysignals` can be interfaced via C/C++ but I don't think that this has been done already.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 08:20:43

I don't think it belongs in Pynac. Several functions are called that are used by Pynac itself. Rather, if you insist on adding a code layer, it should go in the Pynac interface, e.g. `libs/pynac/wrap.h`.

I'm not. I'm saying to put `sig_on()` at the _correct_ layer (which is whatever layer is calling C library functions), not to add a _new_ layer.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 13:03:36

If it goes to correctness:

"...it is possible to declare a function as potentially raising an C++ exception and converting it into a Python exception. For example,


```
cdef extern from "some_file.h":
    cdef int foo() except +
```

This will translate try and the C++ error into an appropriate Python exception (currently an IndexError on std::out_of_range and a RuntimeError otherwise (preserving the what() message)."

See https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/WrappingCPlusPlus#advanced-c-features

The relevant methods all have their "except +" in `libs/pynac/pynac.pxd` so why do we need the `sig_on/off` at all?

1. To allow interrupting a long-running operation.

2. For error handling from low-level C libraries like FLINT (which is what this ticket is about).

None of these reasons have anything to do with C++ exceptions, so I wonder why you brought that up.

What is true is that `cysignals` was not written with C++ in mind. Maybe one could reimplement parts of `cysignals` to be more C++-friendly, for example by raising C++ exceptions (which are then converted to Python exceptions by Cython).

It's the same layer and doing it automatically (maybe if a similar directive to `except +` is given) prevents tickets such as this.

Doing *what* automatically?


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 13:45:28

More exactly. There are two possibilities, a signal handler is set when leaving Python (like `sig_on/off`) or one is set when leaving C++ and calling FLINT. The latter would be in Singular not Pynac however. With this I tend to call it a Singular/libfactory bug.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-09-25 13:54:41

It should be set when leaving Python. However, Pynac is a difficult case because it mixes C++ and Python. So there is no clear Python/C++ boundary.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 14:11:11

In any case cysignals has a tested implementation. Is it possible at all to reuse it from C++?


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-25 14:38:31

Ah I see, `src/sage/rings/padics/transcendantal.c` (sic) uses cysignals.

Comment by rws created at 2017-09-26 07:27:22

This test branch implements calling of `sig_on/off` from the Pynac interface, just for the ticket case. While C++ runtime errors are caught, the ticket case's SIGABRT is not (while it is caught in the first uploaded branch where the `sig_on/off` is called from Python).

How to proceed?

The reason for your problem is that Cython supports either checking for C++ exceptions (`except +`) or Python exceptions (`except something_else`), but not both at the same time.

But as I already said: no additional layer is needed, you can just add the `sig_on`/`sig_off` in the Cython file directly.

The layer that is calling C library functions is the C++ layer (either `expression.pyx` translated to C++ or Singular or Pynac, all of it happens). You just said to insert the insert `sig_on()` in the Cython file. You mean `expression.pyx`, that is, just like I did in the first branch, right?

Sorry, when I said "C" I meant "C or C++". For `cysignals`, C or C++ is the same thing. It's just the separation Python <-> C/C++ that matters.

> You mean `expression.pyx`, that is, just like I did in the first branch, right?

Yes, like in your first branch. However, your branch had many wrong usages like

```
sig_on()
Python code
Pynac call
Python code
sig_off()
```

That is certainly wrong. It should be

```
Python code
sig_on()
Pynac call
sig_off()
Python code
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-09-27 13:55:25

The code calling `normal()` should look like

```
cdef GEx result
sig_on()
try:
    result = self._gobj.normal(0, False, True)
finally:
    sig_off()
return new_Expression_from_GEx(self._parent, result)
```

Note that `_gobj` is a `cdef` attribute, so `self._gobj` involves no Python code. Therefore, it is safe to put inside the `sig_on()` block. On the other hand, `new_Expression_from_GEx()` is unsafe since it invokes Python code like `cls.__new__(cls)` for example.

The `evalf()` code is more complicated. Maybe don't add the `sig_on()` there for now.

And it would be more efficient to replace

```
    def _rel_equal2(self, right):
```

by

```
    cdef bint _rel_equal2(Expression self, Expression other) except -1:
```

This way, you don't need the `cdef Expression l, r` variables.

Please don't! Use your own judgement. You are smarter than the coverage plugin.

I'll leave it as is now; declaring something a helper function is not so bad. Patchbot is go. Please review.
