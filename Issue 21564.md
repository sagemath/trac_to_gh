Reported [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35354/sage-seems-to-be-improperly-computing-an-infinite-sum-and-giving-an-incorrect-answer/):

```
sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, 1000).n()
-0.205068171626375
sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, 10000).n()
-0.204618542543703
sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, 100000).n()  # seems to be converging
-0.204573546255870
sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, oo).n()      # but not to this number
-1.09345743518226

sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, oo)
2/3*log(2) - 14/9
sage: sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, oo).n() - sum(1/((n+1)*(2*n-1)), n, 0, 10000).n()
-0.888838892638556

The fix seems to have entered Sage now. So i am just ading a doctest to prevent the bug to reappear.
