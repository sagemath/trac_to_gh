We should also check whether we can use the standard scipy testsuite instead of our custom hack.

I'd rather just add `pytest` here.

The package `pytest` has quite a lot of dependencies, so it's not trivial to package. I'd like to move forward with this anyway (for Python 3.7 support for one), so I suggest to simple package scipy without its testsuite for now.
