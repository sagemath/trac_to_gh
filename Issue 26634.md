CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

- fix method `tournaments_nauty` using to `bytes_to_str`
- fix doctest in method `RandomDirectedGNC` by avoiding to print the list of edges and testing that the digraph is acyclic instead
- fix method `RandomDirectedGNR` that was calling `networkx.random_gnc` instead of `networkx.random_gnr`... and then fix the doctests by avoiding to print the list of edges and testing instead that the digraph is acyclic and is a tree
