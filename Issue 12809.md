Here is a review patch! This time I see you have already added "Graph" to the function name :) I fixed a typo in the docstring, made the function microscopically faster, and removed an unreachable return statement.

If you agree with the review patch, we can set this to positive review.

I regret that you removed my `i+=0`, for it is always useful to add these statements at random places in the code. Otherwise, thank you again for this review `:-)`
