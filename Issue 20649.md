Thanks (though the tarball have a `.` instead of a `+` in the name). However, this failed to build for me with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS due to it not finding boost:

```
[lrslib-062+autotools-2016-06-28a] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_thread
[lrslib-062+autotools-2016-06-28a] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system
```

Does this need the full version of boost or is Sage's stripped down version sufficient? FYI - I don't have a system-wide install of boost.

That's annoying, considering we didn't need that before.  Is there any possibility of an lrs which doesn't require the full boost?
