One difficulty is that graph generators are exposed in documentation only via file `graph_generators.py`. So removing the `_` is not enough to expose these methods.

I do not want to expose these as part of the API via the global namespace, but it is available here:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html

That is all I want to do, to make these functions part of the API via the documentation. So it is sufficient to just remove the `_`.

I this commit, I'm trying to add the helper method to the doc of `graph_generators`, but the html output is (no compilation error):

```
sage.graphs.graph_generators.pruned_tree
staticmethod(function) -> method

Convert a function to be a static method.

A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom:

class C:
@staticmethod def f(arg1, arg2, …):

…
It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance (e.g. C().f()). The instance is ignored except for its class.

Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. For a more advanced concept, see the classmethod builtin.
