Sometimes, foreign packages need to manipulate environment. this looks impossible right now.

It would be much better to have a directory, where packages may put environment snippets. On sage (the distribution) it makes sense to use `$SAGE_ETC/env.d` and set `SAGE_ETC` to `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc`.

i agree that `/etc/env.d` does not look very useful. but first of all, packages (spkgs) are (supposedly) not required for system installation involving `/etc`. secondly `sysconfdir` (=`$SAGE_ETC`) should default to `$prefix/etc`, where `$prefix` should be something like `/usr/local` or `/opt/sage` (clearly not `/`).

standalone sagelib-into-system installations (e.g. prefix=/usr) are meant to be configured explicitly using --with-sysconfdir=/etc/sage (common practice).

i am aware that sage does not define a prefix, which makes me assume that installation is not implemented in a useful way (yet?) -- YMMV. more workarounds may be required...

Well `/usr/local/etc/env.d` doesn't sound like a particularly good place either...

indeed, maybe it's not a good idea to choose /usr/local as the prefix (i.e. for sage the distibution). but it's consistent.

finally it's the question how much you dislike redundant paths like `$HOME/sage-xyz/etc/sage` `/opt/sage/etc/sage` or `/tmp/sage/etc/sage`. i expect that `/opt/sage` will be the most common case for a prefix eventually, the situation looks very close to http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/opt.html...
