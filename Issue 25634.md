A new option `--gc` is proposed to the Sage doctesting framework. It can be used to control garbage collection as follows:

- `--gc=default`: Python default

- `--gc=always`: run `gc.collect()` before every single test

- `--gc=never`: completely disable GC during doctests

I would have found this useful several times for debugging GC-related failures or for more consistent timing of tests.

Everything seems to work well, and it is definitely a useful feature. (The `--gc` option is ignored when not running a `-t` option, which I think is okay. I am just noting this behavior here for the record.)

One thing I think that is missing is to have this this documented in `sage --advanced`.

Sorry to nitpick, but I think for the `--advanced`, we try to keep it at 70 chars/line, so I would format it as:

```
                           --gc=GC - control garbarge collection (ALWAYS:
                                     collect garbage before every test;
                                     NEVER: disable gc; DEFAULT: Python
                                     default)
```

or possibly

```
                           --gc=GC - control garbarge collection
                                     (ALWAYS: collect garbage before
                                     every test; NEVER: disable gc;
                                     DEFAULT: Python default)
