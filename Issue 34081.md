I would take the occasion to fix the pyflakes hint as well, for example


```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py b/src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
index b8a2a920da..7063a348af 100644
--- a/src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
+++ b/src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
@@ -10871,7 +10871,7 @@ class GenericGraph(GenericGraph_pyx):
         except AttributeError:
             assoc = self._assoc = {}

-        self._assoc[vertex] = object
+        assoc[vertex] = object

```


If done, this can get a positive review.
