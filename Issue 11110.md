The fast static version of the documentation points to the thematic tutorials, but not the live documentation. The patch fixes that.

Looks good to me.  In the other "titles" for these pages, there is no period at the end, so if you wanted to eliminate that for consistency, that would be fine.  But it's not very important, positive review either way.
