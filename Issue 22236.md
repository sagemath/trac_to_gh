This is an intermediate step toward #20736 which has to be done anyway since the spkg does not work anyway, and will not exist anymore as a Sage spkg.

I split into two commits :

* remove the patchbot spkg.
* modify `sage -patchbot` command to link to the wiki.

Regarding the discussion of #20736 it is okay for me if only the first commit get accepted.

I don't agree with the instructions on that wiki page. If this ticket gets merged, I will be forced to edit the wiki page.
