# Issue 10990: remove workarounds in lm() + lex_lead()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11129

Keywords: polybori

Currently, we allow `0.lm()` and `0.lex_lead()`. Recently, the code which requires us to allow this, was fixed in PolyBoRi so we should remove these workarounds once the next version of PolyBoRi is released and included in Sage.
