Keywords: days79

Sage 7.4 and above (at the very least) builds without the OpenSSL bindings for python. The path from #19626 has changed and needs to be updated on newer versions of OS X to:

"${xcode}/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift-migrator/sdks/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/"

(/sdk/ ->/sdks/)

Thanks for the comment!

Please see the latest commit - my editor indented now the whole file (and I reverted the couple of places where it wanted to indent differently than how it was indented by previous people). Hopefully now will be better.

Regarding the checks, I fixed the tested dirs.

Having updated to 10.12.2 I do not have this directory either, anymore. Therefore, I think the most reasonable way of proceeding is either to require users to roll their own openssl (or perhaps some compatible alternative) via e.g. homebrew, or to bundle it in the install (since even gcc is bundled, I think adding openssl would make a small difference). 

What do you think?

Here is how the headers look on my end, with a homebrew openssl (note that the text scrolls to the right):

I removed the code that takes the openssl libraries from the swift framework as apparently this is a very short-lived solution (already disappeared on 10.12.1).

Instead, I am now allowing the user to specify directly via OPENSSL_INCLUDE environment variable, and if it is not defined, I test the directory homebrew installs openssl to.

According to the top level configure file, Sage is not likely to build if either fink or MacPorts is installed:

```
###########################################################################
# (OS X only)
# Sage will probably not build at all if either Fink or MacPorts can be
# found, and the error messages can be extremely confusing.  Even if it does
# build, the product will probably be wrong.  This runs a basic check to

###########################################################################
    PORTS_PATH=`which port`
    if test -f "$PORTS_PATH"; then
as_fn_error $? "\"found MacPorts in $PORTS_PATH. Either:
(1) rename /opt/local and /sw, or
(2) change PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

    FINK_PATH=`which fink`
    if test -f "$FINK_PATH"; then

```

So we shouldn't use them for headers. I don't know if the same is true of homebrew.

Ah, good to know!

Well, I successfully built it while having homebrew installed and it worked fine AFAICT, but still, I can't exclude "the product will probably be wrong".
