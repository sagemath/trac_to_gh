CC:  sage-combinat @bsalisbury1

Currently, there is a discrepancy between `L._basis_key` and the sorting order for `L._indices`, which cases `L.structure_coefficients(True)` to be incorrect. This leads to

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ, 2)
sage: L.universal_enveloping_algebra() # BOOM
```

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23373

I also add some extra safeguards in `L.structure_coefficients` to get rid of the assumption that structure coefficients are indexed by pairs `(a, b)` with `a < b`.
