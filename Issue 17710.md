> Thanks -- this makes things a lot less scarier. I feel I need some more help, though.

Yes. I hope you do not want all these explanations to be written in the doc ?

> Is a simplicial fan the same as a simplicial complex but with "simplex" replaced by "simplicial cone"? 

Yes, essentially, but not quite because some convexity issues enter the definition. For the exact definition of a fan, see Fulton book on toric varieties for example. A simplicial fan is a fan where every cone is simplicial, namely has the minimal number of generators wrt its dimension.

>How exactly do the vectors `d` in `\ZZ^n` give rise to a cone?

The d associated with variables in a given cluster span the rays of a cone.

>Is the cone corresponding to a cluster simply the set of all nonnegative linear combinations of the denominator vectors?

Yes.

> What is a smooth fan? 

a smooth fan is a simplicial fan such that each cone is smooth. A smooth cone is a simplicial cone whose rays define a basis of the lattice (they have determinant +-1)

This is related to the smoothness of the toric variety associated to the fan.

> Why do you require acyclicity; isn't finite-type enough?

No, with this version of the fan. If you apply it to the cyclic quiver with 3 vertices, the result is not an interesting fan (in particular it is not smooth). There is maybe another version of the fan using the g-vector instead. I do not remember the details right now.
