but that's what spkg-check already does, no?

```/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo >&2 "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo >&2 "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi

cd nauty*

# runalltests doesn't exit with a zero status.
# So we check $fails instead.

$MAKE checks
source ./runalltests

if [ "${fails}" -ne "0" ]; then
   echo >&2 "Error checking nauty."
   exit 1
fi
```

26b17 is the 2nd commit, 25r9 is the 1st commit.
Diff is too big to be viewed online, thus check the repo out and do `git diff HEAD^`
I'll mention this in `SPKG.txt`.

the relevant license file is in `nauty-h.in`.
Just make sure that whenever you pour over the next nauty release, the relevant part of the file containing the  license stays intact.
Suggestions how to make this foolproof are welcome. But releases are not frequent at all, so I am not worried. 



> The usual way is to start with "pristine" upstream and patch that. It may be doable to do this with git instead, but in that case I think the procedure would be to rebase your changes to 26b17, not merge 26b17 into your branch (which seems to be what happened now). In that case you'd have to ship your (limited) git history in the tarball as a certificate of what changes have been made relative to upstream, and to give maintainers in the future the means to perform an upgrade in a relatively automated fashion.

there is no "my" branch. The repo is the released version 25r9 patched by 26b17.
