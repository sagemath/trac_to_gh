I would like to get Nicolas's opinion here as those examples are suppose to be minimal implementations, which to me means the category should be as generic as possible (yes, I might not have followed this myself in the past).

It seems that Nicolas is probably not listening anymore. I see two options : merge the branch without his approval or close as invalid.

From what Nicolas has said to me in the past, my inclination is to close an invalid to make the implementation as minimal as possible. However, it is very mild. There is also a valid argument in being more precise in the examples and because it covers a more specific category. So I leave that decision up to you.

Hi Frédéric, Travis!

Sorry, just starting to resurrect from ODK and heavy teaching last semester :-) I hope to finally come progressively back to real coding ...

Minimalism is a feature indeed, notably to not accidentally override generic methods of the categories in the tests.

At the same time, there is no additional code here, just some additional math information. Which illustrates that the user explicitly has to specify whether the set if finite or infinite if they care. The generic code can't deduce this automatically because of potential empty graded components.

So, altogether, given that the patch is written (thanks!), that it provides insight to the user, and that it does not clobber a functionality provided by the category, I lean toward merging it.

If at some point we come up with a more generic example of set with grading, then it will be time to move this example to SetsWithGrading().Infinite().example().

Cheers,

Merci Nicolas.

Je passe donc en positif.
