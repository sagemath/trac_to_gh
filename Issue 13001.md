  The following behavior is wrong.

```
sage: K=QQ['t,s']
sage: L=QQ['t0,t1,s0,s1']  
sage: L.inject_variables()   
Defining t0, t1, s0, s1
sage: Hom(K,L)([t0+t1,s0]).register_as_coercion()
sage: L.coerce_map_from(K)
Ring morphism:
  From: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in t, s over Rational Field
  To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in t0, t1, s0, s1 over Rational Field
  Defn: t |--> t0 + t1
        s |--> s0
sage: K.0*L(1)
t0 + t1   #GOOD
sage: L(K.0)
t0          #BAD
```
