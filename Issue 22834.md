Keywords: graph plot, edge label

When you plot a graph with labels on edges, the label usually appear directly on the edges and it's not very good for readability.

The objective is to add an option to `Graph.plot()` to specify the background color of the label.



```
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        sage: Word('001101').suffix_tree().plot()                                                                                                                                                                                           
```

Seems good, but no time for review just now. I'll CC myself because of posets 'plot()` function.

Did you test `edge_labels_background=None` with or without `dot2tex`? It seems that without that it works incorreclty. I tested with


```
graphs.PetersenGraph().show(edge_labels=True, edge_labels_background=None)
```

You have to use

```
graphs.PetersenGraph().show(edge_labels=True, edge_labels_background="None")
```

because the parameter must be the string "None". I know this is not very intuitive, I'm looking for a way to make it clearer it the documentation if you have any idea.

Ah, OK. I think that `edge_labels_background="opaque"` would work better.

Nope, `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` uses "transparent" so better to use the same terminology.
