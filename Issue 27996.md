CC:  @strogdon

One of the doctest in the file `sage/tests/gap_packages.py` has a result that can depend on the content of the testing user's home directory. Namely if `~/.gap` exist and it is not empty

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/tests/gap_packages.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/tests/gap_packages.py", line 137, in sage.tests.gap_packages.all_installed_packages
Failed example:
    all_installed_packages() == all_installed_packages(gap=gap)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
This can be fixed by telling the test to ignore the content of `~/.gap`.

Reminder: this happens because by default `libgap` always look at the content of `~/.gap` but the pexpect interface to `gap` doesn't. This ticket explicitly discards the content of `~/.gap` in all cases.

I think given the status of `gap -r` that this is the best thing to do. It, of course, does work. Should the description doctest be relative to vanilla Sage? If so, I can change this if you do not have access to vanilla.
