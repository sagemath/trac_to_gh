Haha!  But the difference is that they are not "all live" at the same time by default.  I haven't tried this branch so I don't know about three.js but my guess is that they are all "live" by default?

Well, my point was that such an output is still likely to be quite slow and not very common, so it is not an obstacle for changing the default viewer. Removing jmol completely from the standard distribution and making it optional is a different story.
