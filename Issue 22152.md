Thank you very much for this improvement!

It seems that threejs is well on its way to becoming the default 3d viewer, isn't it?
(maybe a few things are still missing, like `mesh=True`, what else?)

Eric, Andrey and I are working on default lighting on #22261. Beyond that there is a major structural issue of handling more than sixteen Three.js scenes embedded in a single page, since most browsers start dropping WebGL contexts after that number. I know how to deal with this when I have complete control over a page, but that might not be true in either Jupyter or native Sage notebooks. I'll need time to work on that before calling this viewer ready for being the default.

How well are 17 jmol plots working for you?-)

Thanks a lot for this, i hate when Sage leaks remotely, without even noticing the user.

> How well are 17 jmol plots working for you?-)

Haha!  But the difference is that they are not "all live" at the same time by default.  I haven't tried this branch so I don't know about three.js but my guess is that they are all "live" by default?

Yup!

Well, my point was that such an output is still likely to be quite slow and not very common, so it is not an obstacle for changing the default viewer. Removing jmol completely from the standard distribution and making it optional is a different story.

I've opened #22408 to continue the discussion.
