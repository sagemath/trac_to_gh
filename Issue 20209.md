# Issue 20209: GLPKExactBackend - a variation on GLPKBackend that sets a solver parameter and signals errors on integer variables

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20446

GLPK has an exact simplex method, which can be requested by setting a solver parameter. 
Via #20406, a user can set this parameter.

It would be more convenient to define a named backend that does that. 

Also, setting the solver parameter actually causes GLPK to solve the continuous relaxation, ignoring all integer variables. This might be surprising to users.


```
sage: delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space(19,15,7,isinteger=True)
3
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: def glpk_exact_solver():                                               
        b = get_solver(solver="GLPK")
        b.solver_parameter("simplex_or_intopt", "exact_simplex_only")
        return b
sage: delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space(19,15,7,solver=glpk_exact_solver,isinteger=True)
glp_exact: 54 rows, 20 columns, 795 non-zeros
...
2
```



So there would be value in a named backend that actually signals an error when the user requests integer variables (like the CVXOpt and InteractiveLP backends do).


```
sage: delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space(19,15,7,solver="GLPK/exact",isinteger=True)
ValueError: This backend does not handle integer variables
```


While at it, could also support the "glp_simplex followed by glp_exact" mode that is mentioned in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18735#comment:7

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-04-18 08:35:11

the docstring is not correct here:

```
+    def _test_add_linear_constraint_vector(cls, tester=None, **options):
+        """
+        Run tests on the method :meth:`.add_linear_constraints`.
```

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-04-18 08:40:03

indentation here is weird:

```
cdef class PPLBackend(GenericBackend):
+
+    """
+    TESTS::
+
+            sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
+            sage: p = get_solver(solver = "PPL")
+            sage: TestSuite(p).run(skip="_test_pickling")
```

do we plan on having this merged, or "wishlist" means something elese?

It's ready for review, with the intent of having it merged. I've created a new ticket for an additional wishlist item.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-04-18 21:32:05

I get a merge conflict with #20414 here.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-04-18 21:51:21

Seems to merge cleanly here.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-04-18 21:56:42

here is what I see in `backends/generic_backend.pyx`

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
        raise ValueError("'solver' should be set to 'GLPK', 'Coin', 'CPLEX', 'CVXOPT', 'Gurobi', 'PPL', 'InteractiveLP', None (in which case the default one is used), or a callable.")
=======
        raise ValueError("'solver' should be set to 'GLPK', 'GLPK/exact', 'Coin', 'CPLEX', 'CVXOPT', 'Gurobi', 'PPL', 'InteractiveLP', or None (in which case the default one is used).")
>>>>>>> e7a2bd7d86034b16c8407ae534d75c39956edbf4
```

It's this commit:

```
commit cc2d999c5234040914a4fee66708f33124eef8a9
Author: Matthias Koeppe <mkoeppe@math.ucdavis.edu>
Date:   Thu Apr 14 10:19:22 2016 -0700

    Mention solver=callable in docstrings and error messages
```

that causes the clash

Ah, that's #20406.

OK, rebased on top of 7.2.beta4 + #20406 + #20323.

Yes, you were missing this file that I forgot to check in! Apologies...

your new backends are not listed in this index:
`local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/numerical/index.html`
which is produced from
`src/doc/en/reference/numerical/index.rst`

please add them all...

Nice, the new testsuite actually works.

Fixed copying of GLPKExactBackend instances. 
Rebased on 7.2.beta5.
