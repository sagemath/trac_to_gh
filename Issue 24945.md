Some methods expect a Sage integer from the degree method but this is not consistent accross sage polynomials

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(Zmod(3), 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: type(R1.an_element().degree())
<type 'int'>
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(Zmod(3), 'x', implementation='FLINT')
sage: type(R2.an_element().degree())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```


As a consequence

```
sage: GF(next_prime(2^63)^6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'divisors'
```
