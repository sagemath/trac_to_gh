Symptoms:

```
sage: sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x, -pi, pi), (y, -pi, pi))
/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:570: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: Jmol failed to create file '/home/vbraun/.sage/temp/volker-desktop/26924/dir_3hQKAo/preview.png', see '/home/vbraun/.sage/temp/volker-desktop/26924/tmp_1qrTOl.txt' for details
  RichReprWarning,
Graphics3d Object
```

This is because jmol is not installed by default:

```
$ ll /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar
ls: cannot access /home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/share/jmol/JmolData.jar: No such file or directory
```

Installing jmol manually fixes it

Actually, I don't know why that would fix it: `STANDARD_PACKAGES` should already have been built by that point. But this change can't hurt...

I don't see how the wrong dependency of `$(STARTED)` could cause jmol to be not installed. So I guess there must be something different going on here.

Also, the dependencies of `$(STARTED)` would only play a role if you explicitly execute `make start`, not when doing just `make`.
