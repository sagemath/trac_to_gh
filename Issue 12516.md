I discovered this while working on #12541.  Documentation says the `check` will "coerce entries of gens into base field."  This does not appear to be happening, and should.  

First example is the root problem - second just shows that the `check` flag seems ineffectual.  I haven't looked at the code yet.


```
sage: (QQ^2).span(gens=[vector(QQ, [1,1/2])], base_ring=ZZ, check=True)
Free module of degree 2 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  1 1/2]
sage: (QQ^2).span(gens=[vector(QQ, [1,1/2])], base_ring=ZZ, check=False)
Free module of degree 2 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  1 1/2]
```

I'll look at it today/tomorrow if nobody beats me.

A side remark (for probably the next ticket?): while working on #12541 I had to fix several pieces of code that looked almost the same. In fact, I have removed exactly the same *wrong* lines from six places or so in different specializations of free modules. Perhaps these `span` and `submodule` methods can be somehow consolidated, e.g. have `span` only in the base class which calls `_span` of subclasses for actual work after all the typechecking and conversion. Or, if it is really necessary to have them everywhere, maybe there can be only 1 or 2 good long docstrings, as the one provided by Rob here, and others should just link to it?

Little picks:

I have not looked, but it would not surprise me if there was some beneficial consolidation.  Maybe at Bug Days in a few weeks I'll tackle this one.
