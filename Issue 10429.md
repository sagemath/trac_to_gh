this  all works OK (on sage 4.6.1.alpha3);
what I do not know is whether GraphWL should be installed as a method for graphs.

Can we have a mildly interesting example in the doctest, i.e. refining which does not produce an orbital-induced refinement?
The smallest non-directed example like this is the [Shrikhande strongly regular graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrikhande_graph) on 16 vertices; a the smallest directed example a certain tournament on 15 vertices.

Shrikhande graph is mentioned on #9136.
Maybe you can contribute its Sage implementation along the way!
