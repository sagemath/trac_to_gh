Can `make test` and friends be split into subtargets,
so they can be interrupted and resumed later?

For instance one target per `src/sage/` subdirectory.

Test logs could be split too, decreasing attachment
size in mailing list posts.

With #33995, you can at least do `make ptest TEST_FILES=src/sage/geometry`
