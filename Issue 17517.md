# Issue 17517: stopgap enhancement

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17754

Original creator: jakobkroeker

Original creation time: 2015-02-09 17:37:54

CC:  was roed jen kcrisman ncohen

Karl-Dieter Crisman commented about stopgaps that he would find it inappropriate, if *everytime* sage is restarted, a user will get warnings when using routines which return incorrect results; see discussion at http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17183

So one could imagine following enhancement:

   - Show a `stopgap` only once per installation per user per sage-version 

In case a user wants a different behaviour, `stopgap` could be made configurable
e.g. in a way that a stopgap is shown in case of a hit once every time sage is executed.

Also I could imagine to warn greenhorns about bugs in CAS by showing at start a message that mathematical software may contain bugs leading to wrong results, with a link to [Mathematically wrong answer](http://trac.sagemath.org/report/79) list and to [bug list](http://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=new&status=needs_work&status=needs_review&status=needs_info&status=positive_review&type=defect&max=0&order=id)

some data points:

 - In practice I have never once heard of any complaints from anybody about not being able to turn off a stopgap message.  Never -- not once.  So this isn't a problem in practice.

- If abs_integrate really is completely broken and full of bugs, then I would want a stopgap whenever it is first used in a session.  Doesn't that make sense?   And why are we using it if it is so broken -- it should require an explicit flag to use at all.  Sage is supposed to **default** to correct answers unless you otherwise explicitly request otherwise, unlike say PARI which has the opposite design.  

- We could nonetheless add a message to the stopgap output that says: "to hide this stopgap message so you don't see it anymore, type hide_stopgap('some-hash-of-message').  Then locally for that user (in ~/.sage) we could have a file ~/.sage/hide-stopgaps, with lines corresponding to hashes of stopgap messages.   The stopgap function would load and consult this file before displaying a stopgap message.  This gives each individual user very clear control over the stopgap functionality.   To be even clearer, we could even just put hide_stopgap('name-of-stopgap') or even hide_stop('exact stopgap message'), rather than a hash, so the user can clearly see what they are ignoring by consulting ~/.sage/hide-stopgaps.  I.e., no hashes at all.

Gee, calm down ;-). This is a half-baked enhancement suggestion, not criticism.
.

> add hide_stopgap('some-hash-of-message')

That would be fine right now. At a later time point when the stopgap list will be huge 
(no worries, I will work on that soon *g ) that might be no longer sufficient.
.

>In practice I have never once heard of any complaints from anybody about not being able to turn off a stopgap message. Never -- not once.

People usually do not complain, they work around issues. We have to acitvely ask for reports 
(as I had e.g. to for [Singular bug 694](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/694) by Dino Lorenzini; or for #17697 - my office colleague dit hit it,...) 
.

>Never -- not once.  So this isn't a problem in practice. 
now once : #17183 *g. If a feature is not perfect, users might not accept it (reread #17183). The question here is, if we should care or not.
.

Absolutely, that makes sense... for most of us. Why not add some tolerance for users/developers with a different point of view?

>    - Show a `stopgap` only once per installation per user per sage-version 

That would be pretty much pointless. It's so easy to miss a warning the first time. I think it would be essentially equivalent to removing stopgaps completely.

On a more technical note, for the Notebook you certainly don't want to do this. Showing a warning once would mean that only one notebook of one user would see the message.

Sorry -- I worry a huge amount about how to effectively decide to spend time.  Mistakenly spending time on things that aren't big problems is a huge danger, so I'm particularly careful about it.

I'm worried not due to criticism but because this suggestion is dangerous as is... as Jereon says.

People complain a lot to me...

> Absolutely, that makes sense... for most of us. Why not add some tolerance for users/developers with a different point of view?

I agree; that's why I also included some ideas for how to do this.   

I think my suggested approach addresses jdmeyer's very valid concerns (which I also have).   Instead of showing the message once, make the user have to very explicitly turn off the warning. 

That said, I don't think this should be a high priority.

Indeed. I opened the ticket as 'minor'.

For the record, if I knew a way to do this easily for `abs_integrate` I would do it today.  See #12371 - maybe comment:11:ticket:12371 is the closest to something we could do.  The problem is that it gives a lot of very good enhancements.

That is not really a comment about this ticket, but now you know where to look for that.

typo? I guess it should be #12731

Yes, I was in a big hurry to just get that comment off, sorry.  So the comment [comment:11:ticket:12731 here] as well.
