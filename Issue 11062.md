The root cause of this defect is that the coordinates of class group elements were Pari integers. 

The problem wasn't detected before because only generators were tested in the doctests for `sage.rings.number_field.class_group.FractionalIdealClass.order` .

The attached patch fixes the problem and alters one doctest.

Thanks, I will test it.  However, you should add a doctest to show that the problem from this ticket is fixed (so needs_work for this reason).

Done.  All the previous tests only took powers of a generator.

Looks good!  Patch makes sense and fixes the problem.

I also tested the patch (after #11230 and on the way to #11130) and everything tested fine.
