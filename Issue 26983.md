# Issue 26983: Allow different function field implementations to have different differential classes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27220

Original creator: @BrentBaccala

Original creation time: 2019-02-04 20:45:45

This code adds an Element to `FunctionFieldDifferential` and makes some simple changes so that element_class() is used to construct differentials.

This allows function field implementations to define custom classes for their associated differentials.
