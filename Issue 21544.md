My biggest issue on #18920 was that git produces patches per commit, not per file (the latter was the original structure of patches in Sage, it seems).

A sane workflow in this case would be to maintain Sage patches as a branch for the Maxima git repo, that can be rebased against their updates. This would be then (semi)automatic to produce a new set of patches.

Nothing wrong with that as far as I can see.

Yes. Actually create a new branch before rebasing, so that the old branch is kept.

One patch per file really makes no sense. One patch per commit makes a lot more sense.

Please apply #21793 when writing documentation :-) You left some TABs.

Is there _any_ package which actually uses the procedure explained in "How to maintain a set of patches"? It would be strange to document that as if it is standard practice, when in reality it is never done.

I am trying to follow this as I work on Maxima update in #18920, as we bring a number of upstream patches in.

Done.

Not fully yet. 

 - I've created a patch for `gc` like this from the fork at https://github.com/mkoeppe/bdwgc -- but I did not import the existing `cygwin64.patch` that was in the sage patches.

 - I've created the SCIPoptsuite patches like this -- but I cannot use a public github for the changed SCIP sources because of its licensing.

Is this a "positive review"?

From me, yes, but I was going to wait for someone like Jeroen or Volker to sign off on this.
