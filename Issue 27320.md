Currently spanning_trees() method does not enumerate spanning trees with their labels , it makes their labels None. This tickets aims to return the correct labels of the edges.

You should add parameter `labels=False` to the method so that user get edge labels only when specifically asked for.

2 remarks:

- the text for the doctest could provide more information like `Edges of the spanning trees can be labeled or unlabeled (:trac:`27557`)::`

- when calling `_recursive_..`, you don't need to write `labels=labels`.

```diff
-            return _recursive_spanning_trees(Graph(self, immutable=False, loops=False), forest, labels=labels)
+            return _recursive_spanning_trees(Graph(self, immutable=False, loops=False), forest, labels)
```


It would be nice to also get `spanning_tree_iterator()`. May be for another ticket.
