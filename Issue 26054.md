Keywords: pool ETuple

Working on #26243, I found that one can get a substantial speed-up by implementing a pool for ETuple (so that memory allocation and deallocation occurs less often).

I chose the component "memleak", because my first attempt at implementing a pool has a memory leak...

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26291

Ouch, I am so sorry! For some reasons, I got the timings wrong and though that the pool gives a speed-up. But it doesn't.

}
```

I have rebased the old branch on top of the current develop branch. Also, I changed all remaining `for i from 0<=i<whatever` to `for i in range(whatever)`.

Here are timings. For test, I am using this:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict import ETuple
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict cimport ETuple
....: from sage.all import get_memory_usage
....: def test_new(ETuple T):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         T = T._new()
....: def test_addmin(ETuple T):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         T = T.emin(T.eadd(T))
....: """)
sage: T = ETuple(range(20))
```

Timing with `develop`:

```
sage: %timeit test_new(T)
1000 loops, best of 3: 299 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_addmin(T)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.98 ms per loop
```

Timing with the branch from here:

```
sage: %timeit test_new(T)
10000 loops, best of 3: 71.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_addmin(T)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.96 ms per loop
```


So, the time for creating new instance has indeed improved. However, it also becomes clear that the creation of a new tuple (which occurs both in `.eadd()` and `.emin()`) is negligible compared with what else is to be done.

Therefore, I believe that having an ETuple pool is not a real improvement after all. But I let this up to the reviewer: If you think that the improvement isn't worth the effort, then review this as "invalid/won't fix". If you think "why not?", then we can of course keep working on it.

Actually I am not fully deallocating the tuple data in `tp_dealloc`! I only dealloc the tuple data if the pool is full and thus every data has to go to oblivion. But if an ETuple is parked in the pool, then the tuple data is in fact kept. If later the ETuple is revived, the tuple data is not allocated but reallocated during `__init__` (which typically should be faster than a full deallocation followed by an allocation).

So, I guess ``@`cython.freelist(1000)` won't be equivalent.
