The comment

```
# We must have len(p[j-1]) > len(r), otherwise we would
#   have added x to the previous row
```

comes from if `len(p[j-1]) == len(r)` (recall `r = p[j]`) and we wanted to add the entry `x` to the end of `r`, then by the strictly increasing condition, we should have added `x` to the end of `p[j-1]`. It means that we can skip the check that `len(p[j-1]) > len(r)`.

Ah, I got it! I think my way of saying it is clearer, though.

In other news, am I seeing it right that `reversed(d.items())` and `reversed(row_dict.values())` are fragile? I'll replace them by safer things.

Ah, yes, those are bad. Should be `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: -x[0])` (the minus should do the reversal, otherwise just also add the `reverse=True`) and `sorted(row_dict.values(), reverse=True)` resp. I don't know what I was thinking...
