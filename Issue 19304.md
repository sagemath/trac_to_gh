```
comes from if `len(p[j-1]) == len(r)` (recall `r = p[j]`) and we wanted to add the entry `x` to the end of `r`, then by the strictly increasing condition, we should have added `x` to the end of `p[j-1]`. It means that we can skip the check that `len(p[j-1]) > len(r)`.

Ah, I got it! I think my way of saying it is clearer, though.

In other news, am I seeing it right that `reversed(d.items())` and `reversed(row_dict.values())` are fragile? I'll replace them by safer things.

I won't argue.
