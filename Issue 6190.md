Hi David,

Thanks for the changes.  I'd intended to do them, since I understand ReST better now than I did a few weeks ago, but you've done a nice job with it.

Passes doctests on this one file, which it should since all of the changes are to documentation (not code, or tests).  HTML version builds without errors and looks very nice.

Positive review.

Rob
