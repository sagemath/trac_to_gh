The function `refine_root()` from `complex_roots.py` is a pretty general NewtonÂ­-Raphson implementation. In light of further changes and also allowing real root refining, we move this (with deprecation) to a new Cython file.

There are no changes at all to the code.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19361
