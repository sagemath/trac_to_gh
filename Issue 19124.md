# Issue 19124: Move refine_root() to a new file

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-10-06 07:48:52

The function `refine_root()` from `complex_roots.py` is a pretty general NewtonÂ­-Raphson implementation. In light of further changes and also allowing real root refining, we move this (with deprecation) to a new Cython file.

There are no changes at all to the code.
