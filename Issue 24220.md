After #24456, `sage.rings.real_field.RealField` will be the parent for the set of real numbers. As a consequence, it would be wise to change the name of `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField` to `RealFloatingPointField`.

In `real_mpfr.pyx` do you mean to rename `cpdef RealField(int prec=53,...)` or `cdef class RealField_class`?

It is. The old real field is the field of floating point numbers that is intensively used (and renamed in this ticket). The new real field is the field of real numbers (the real one).

why not. But it will
- be a much more delicate backward incompatibility.
- make the ticket even bigger
The 2 steps transition seems simpler to me.

> - i am not sure that completely changing the behaviour of `RealField` without any kind of deprecation period is wise, how will the user's code survive to this change ?

There **must** be deprecation about the name changes (which is not the case in the current branch). `RealField` shoud still point to the `FloatingPointField` (with deprecation) and `RR` should still point to `RFF` (with deprecation).

I don't think there is a need for deprecation about the change of printing.

> - do you really plan to change a behaviour that implies modifying 164 files without even an email to sage-devel ?

+1 for Floating-point.

I'm confused. You deleted the description item that renames `RealField/RealField_class` in comment:29. Does that mean those refactorings are not planned in this ticket? On the other hand you write `isinstance(x, RealFloatingPointField)` so the new name is used?

Though it would be better to first change the names:
- `RealField` -> `RealFloatingPointField_factory`
- `RealField_class` -> `RealFloatingPointField`
- `RealNumber` -> `RealFloatingPoint`
to avoid passing twice on the same lines.
