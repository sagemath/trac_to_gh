After #24456, `sage.rings.real_field.RealField` will be the parent for the set of real numbers. As a consequence, it would be wise to change the name of `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField` to `RealFloatingPointField`.

It is. The old real field is the field of floating point numbers that is intensively used (and renamed in this ticket). The new real field is the field of real numbers (the real one).

If so, I would rather rename it to `create_RealFloatingPointField`.

I think that we should get rid of this function and the hand made cache. The caching would better be handled by `UniqueRepresentation` by appropriately writing `__classcall__`/`__init__`. This class is very old.

why not. But it will

The 2 steps transition seems simpler to me.

There **must** be deprecation about the name changes (which is not the case in the current branch). `RealField` shoud still point to the `FloatingPointField` (with deprecation) and `RR` should still point to `RFF` (with deprecation).

I don't think there is a need for deprecation about the change of printing.

+1 for Floating-point.

Though it would be better to first change the names:
- `RealField` -> `RealFloatingPointField_factory`
- `RealField_class` -> `RealFloatingPointField`
- `RealNumber` -> `RealFloatingPoint`
to avoid passing twice on the same lines.
