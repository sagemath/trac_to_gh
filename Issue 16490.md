A degenerate input is a corner case: one-element hypergraphs and complete uniform hypergraphs are surely degenerate inputs. Such tests don't stress much of the implementation, as you can imagine.
Test on, say, `ProjectiveGeometryDesign(3,1,GF(2))` as well.

Dima, are you aware that the only thing we are testing here is whether an element belongs to a LIST ? Python does not care at all what the elements are, it is all pointers as far as it is concerned.

I am not against doctests, I am against your spending my time on this. I believe that this function is sufficiently doctested, and I already added tests because you asked. If they don't satisfy you for some reason, I do not mind it but you will have to write your own and add it to the branch.

It has nothing to do with religion, this is just common sense, sorry.

I believe that I explained sufficiently clear that testing only corner cases does not work, yet you added another corner case test, for a complete uniform hypergraph is a corner case, AFAIK.

And I have elected to be a reviewer, sorry. It is my job to decide what a sufficient doctest is, not yours.
Well, if you cannot add the doctests I ask for, I can surely do this too, only then you will be spending my time on this, not the other way around.

Yo !

> I believe that I explained sufficiently clear that testing only corner cases does not work, yet you added another corner case test, for a complete uniform hypergraph is a corner case, AFAIK.

A uniform hypergraph is a "corner case" in hypergraph theory. Not as an example of Python list. I mixed integers and strings, and order. That's how I tested non-corner cases that made sense from the point of view of what this function does. It is also a doctest of the bug I reported in this ticket's description.

> And I have elected to be a reviewer, sorry. It is my job to decide what a sufficient doctest is, not yours.

Indeed, but when you see that you cannot explain what you want without making lose the other guy's time because he apparently does not get it, you can save everybody by writing the 4 lines yourself.
