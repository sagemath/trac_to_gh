# Issue 15654: Make Ipython %run handle .sage files as .sage files, not .py files

Make a file containing just `print 1/2`.  Do `sage test1.sage` to get the `test1.py` file in your directory.  Then run Sage and do this:


```
    sage: %run test1.sage
    0
    sage: %run test1.py
    1/2
```


In my view, this should be the same as doing `sage test1.sage` in both cases, though.

I'm putting this under interfaces because it's an IPython compatibility thing, but if that's wrong, change it.
