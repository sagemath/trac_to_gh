I guess the optional spkg `database_sloane_oeis-2005-12.spkg` could be removed.

The package contains a `sloane-oeis.bz2` which expands to a 20.165.423 Bytes file `sloane-oeis`. This file has 113134 records (with no obvious sort logic):

```
A000004 ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
A112316 ,0,0,0 ...
```


On the other hand the module `\src\sage\databases\sloane.py` downloads a current file `http://oeis.org/stripped.gz` (17.971.650 Bytes). 

This expands to a 45.252.744 Bytes file with 236976 records (including the 4 header records):

```


sloane.py also downloads `http://oeis.org/names.gz` with (8.330.058.251 Bytes (expanded 20.853.789 Bytes) and some same number of records as strippd.gz:

```

`striped` contains more than double the number of sequence records compared to `sloane-oeis`. Often the sequences have additional elements. The new file may also contain corrected errors ...

I confirm that the 2005 package is outdated and thus incomplete, and is included in the current stripped.gz file. So, if this file is actually used, the 2005 package is completely useless, except for historical purposes.

Comparing the sequences of the outdated spkg with the current list of sequences there are `about 2.000 sequences with errors`. 
This is without counting those that only acquired some new initial elements (like 0, 1, -1, or 2) or those that grew longer.

The spkg should clearly to be removed!

Harald, can you delete the spkg from the web server?
