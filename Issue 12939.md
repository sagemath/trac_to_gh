Keywords: camera light tachyon

When using the tachyon ray tracer, at the moment the parameters for the camera, as well as for the light and for the background-plane are hard-coded in `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`:

```
    def tachyon(self):
    ...
         camera
            zoom 1.0
            aspectratio 1.0
            antialiasing %s
            raydepth 8
            center  2.3 2.4 2.0
            viewdir  -2.3 -2.4 -2.0
            updir  0.0 0.0 1.0
         end_camera

      light center  4.0 3.0 2.0
            rad 0.2
            color  1.0 1.0 1.0

      plane
        center -2000 -1000 -500
        normal 2.3 2.4 2.0
        TEXTURE
            AMBIENT 1.0 DIFFUSE 1.0 SPECULAR 1.0 OPACITY 1.0
            COLOR 1.0 1.0 1.0
            TEXFUNC 0
```

Those things should be variable, i.e. it should be possible to pass those parameters by optional parameters (e.g. when calling `show`).

This is the long-awaited possibility to control many aspects of the tachyon viewer by
options of the `show()` method.
All available options are now properly documented.

(The tachyon viewer has now more available controls than the default threejs viewer, but
reorganizing the threejs options would be another project with a separate ticket.)

I also added an overview comparing the different viewer choices, and some warnings about some unexpected behaviour of certain viewers.
(There is also some code for a so-called `"wavefront"` viewer. Is that obsolete?)

All of these comments are related to the parameter `camera_center`:

* In `plot/base.pyz`, two examples still use the old parameter `camera_center`. However it will be ignored since it is not in `tachyon_keywords`:

```
            sage: p.show(viewer="tachyon",camera_center=(4,0,0))
            sage: p.show(viewer="tachyon",camera_center=(2,2,0.3),aspect_ratio=1)
```
 
* Instead of removing a parameter from a function directly, a `DeprecationWarning` should be raised for some time before removing the parameter entirely. This makes sure that old examples still behave the same and tells the user to switch to the new parameter.

* In `threejs_template.html`, when clicking on `Get camera` option, it copies `',camera_center=' + cam_position` (the old parameter name). I also suggest to only copy the value of camera position, not with the whole sentence. This makes it similar to what `Copy Viewpoint` does.

> 

The old name `camera_center` was the name I chose initially, following the convention of the Tachyon object.
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.html

I chose to rename it because "camera position" is what is commonly used in computer graphics, but it has never been a parameter of show() or the tachyon() function before I introduced it; so there is no need to deprecate it.

(But I have to fix the few places where I forgot to change it.)

```

If not, just make the indentation to 4 spaces in the paragraph starting with "By default..."
* In the function `_flip_orientation`, did you mean Javascript (threejs) instead of Java, or you meant jmol? Also the first word in the docstring of this function should be capitalized.

Other than that, this ticket looks good to me.

Fixed. (Anyway, what is the purpose of that test? Somebody adds a line to the beginning
of the tachyon output, then that test must be updated.)

> * In `threejs_template.html`: "Get camera" -> "Get Camera" to make the UI consistent. (Just a suggestion)

I have changed "Get Viewpoint" to "Get viewpoint" for consistency.

No, I indeed want only a short warning. On my system, the following text comes out separate from the warning in the html doc. I have now increased the indentation of the warning to 4 (extra) spaces. The result looks the same as before.

> * In the function `_flip_orientation`, did you mean Javascript (threejs) instead of Java, or you meant jmol? Also the first word in the docstring of this function should be capitalized.

I factored this function out from some other part
of the program (copying the comment), but I don't understand why it is there.

Yes, the result looks the same. It is just a general convention to use 4 spaces.

The tickets looks go to me, and thus I will put it on positive review once the patchbot finishes.
