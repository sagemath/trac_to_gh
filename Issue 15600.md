# Issue 15600: combine Tachyon and Graphics3d objects

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: tachyon, graphics3d

If `T` is a Tachyon object and `P` is a Graphics3d object, `T + P` could return a Tachyon object, or some object subclassed from Tachyon, by extracting the tachyon string of `P` and combining it with that of `T`.  This would make it possible to convert Graphics3d objects to Tachyon objects by adding them to an empty tachyon scene.

See [this answer from AskSage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/20/the-tachyon-object-used-for-rendering-plots?answer=4703#4703) for a start.
