Keywords: normal crystals, categories

Currently the crystals category assumes that all crystals are normal. With #14192 and #14413, there are non-normal crystals going into Sage. This will add a new subcategory of crystals for normal crystals.

I posted a review patch which moves some material to the appropriate category. There is still one issue: there are tests for the Stembridge rules in the finite crystal category. But really they should be in a finite/regular category. Should we create a separate category for finite regular crystals?
