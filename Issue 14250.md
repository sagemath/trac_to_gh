# Issue 14250: Normal crystals category

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2013-04-15 18:31:44

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat bsalisbury1 aschilling nthiery

Keywords: normal crystals, categories

Currently the crystals category assumes that all crystals are normal. With #14192 and #14413, there are non-normal crystals going into Sage. This will add a new subcategory of crystals for normal crystals.

Changing dependencies to make #14402 a dependency of this ticket.

After some discussion with Ben, we decided to call these regular crystals (this agrees with the crystals tutorial).

For patchbot:

Apply: trac_14454-regular_crystals-ts.patch

I posted a review patch which moves some material to the appropriate category. There is still one issue: there are tests for the Stembridge rules in the finite crystal category. But really they should be in a finite/regular category. Should we create a separate category for finite regular crystals?

I believe the Stembridge axioms are valid for any crystal with a simply-laced Cartan matrix, with no assumption that the crystal is finite.  Can the Stembridge axioms be moved to the regular crystals category with an added condition that if the cardinality of the crystal is infinite (or unknown), then only test to finite depth?

I tried this, but then the tests in generalized_young_walls.py did not pass any longer.

I should say for the highest weight crystals in that file.

New version of the patch with the review patch folded in and a couple of other tweaks.

This needs to be rebased to #14287.

The following doctest really takes too long:

```
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/combinat/crystals/generalized_young_walls.py", line 850, in sage.combinat.crystals.generalized_young_walls.HighestWeightCrystalOfGYW.__init__
Failed example:
    TestSuite(YLa).run() # long time
Test ran for 203.43 s
**********************************************************************
```


It is *by far* the longest doctest in all of Sage. Can this test be made faster? Or removed in the worst case?

Hey Jeroen,

I'm working on it right now. I'll let you know what I find.

Best,

Travis
