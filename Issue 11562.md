Keywords: sage_wraps sources gentoo

According to private conversation with Francois Bissey, #9976 has introduced a problem that makes it impossible start sage-4.7.1 on Gentoo. That's pretty serious, and so this ticket is a blocker.

The problem is that sage_wraps reads the sources of to-be-wrapped functions and methods. The sources are stored as an attribute to the wrapper, which, on the one hand, is a waste of memory. Worse: Reading the Cython sources is impossible for sage-on-gentoo. Therefore, sage can't start.

My patch introduces some lightweight classes, that simply store a reference to an object (e.g., the to-be-wrapped function) and return the sources or source lines or the argument list *only when called*.

Attachment

The patch should solve the problem with prematurely reading sources on gentoo. However, I can not test it, myself. Francois, can you verify it?

**__Benefits__**

__Startuptime__

The startuptime did slightly improve (but perhaps that is not significant):

Without patch

```
$ ./sage -startuptime
## Tree
sage.all: 1.132 (None)
...
```

With patch

```
$ ./sage -startuptime
## Tree
sage.all: 1.045 (None)
```


__Memory__

The memory consumption improved as well:

Without patch:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
861.2890625
```

With patch:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
861.234375
```


__Bugfix__

Not reading the sources when a function is wrapped has an additional benefit: If one interactively defines a lambda function and wraps it, then the source is not available. Hence, the following example (that is a new doctest) used to fail:

```
        sage: def square(f):
        ...     @sage_wraps(f)
        ...     def new_f(x):
        ...         return f(x)*f(x)
        ...     return new_f
        ... 
        sage: f = lambda x:x^2
        sage: g = square(f)
        sage: g(3)
        81
```

Without the patch, the last line fails with a mysterious attribute error (the user would certainly have not easily been able to track the problem down).

If I remember correctly, I once tried that approach. The line `argspec = sage_getargspec(wrapped)` was introduced for a reason (something went wrong), but I can't remember what it was.

Did you run full tests with your patch?

The ticket description states "introduced a problem that makes it impossible start sage-4.7.1 on Gentoo." I thought that it *is* clear enough.

Concerning documentation: It looks very nice!

Just for testing, I had inserted a function with a complicated argument list, and put it under the `@`singular_standard_options decorator:

```
@singular_standard_options
def MyTestFunc(bla, blubb, bar={'bla':{1:2}}, foo=None, **kwds):

It is shown in the reference manual exactly as it should.

In addition, the doc tests pass, the startup time seems to slightly improve (perhaps not significantly), and the memory consumption decreases a little.

I hope I understood correctly that it will fix the problem on gentoo.

In general, if a bug is fixed, it should be demonstrated by a new doc test. The example that I gave above *does* fail (at least for me) without the patch. So, I think it should be included. If nobody beats me to it, I'd provide that example in a referee patch.

> I'm not sure if I misunderstand what you mean to say with 'significantly'

There is the "sage -startuptime" script. It prints a lot of data, but the time for importing sage.all is most important, as much as I understood.

Without the patch, I get with sage-4.7.2.alpha2:

```
## Slowest (including children)
1.242 sage.all (None)
```

With the patch, I get:
## Slowest (including children)
1.133 sage.all (None)
}}}

However, these times are a little flaky. So, I don't know if we can call it significant if the difference is 10%.

Concerning the additional test: It is a bit strange. It turned out that it *does* fail when I execute it on command line, but it does *not* fail (even without your patch) when it is a doc test. Apparently, in a doc test, Sage is able to find the function definition, which is impossible on the command line.

Btw. I use dumbbench and a *silenced* version of startuptime to make sure that I'm not only seeing random speedups.

OK, please do!

You removed a few sage_wraps for a test? 

Actually I find the speedup not mysterious. The 10% are just with your patch, i.e., I did not additionally remove sage_wraps. And the reason for the speedup is clear: Python's `inspect.getargspec` is insufficient for Sage. It can not deal with Cython functions, and of course it can not understand the special wrappers in Sage:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: cython('cpdef f(a,b,c=None): pass')
sage: inspect.getargspec(f)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/local/lib/python/inspect.pyc in getargspec(func)
    801         func = func.im_func
    802     if not isfunction(func):
--> 803         raise TypeError('arg is not a Python function')
    804     args, varargs, varkw = getargs(func.func_code)
    805     return ArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, func.func_defaults)

TypeError: arg is not a Python function
```

and similarly

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x,y]
sage: inspect.getargspec(I.interreduced_basis)
ArgSpec(args=[], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=None)
sage: inspect.getargspec(I.groebner_basis)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.2.alpha2/local/lib/python/inspect.pyc in getargspec(func)
    801         func = func.im_func
    802     if not isfunction(func):
--> 803         raise TypeError('arg is not a Python function')
    804     args, varargs, varkw = getargs(func.func_code)
    805     return ArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, func.func_defaults)

TypeError: arg is not a Python function
```

while the Sage autoinspection finds

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(I.interreduced_basis)
ArgSpec(args=['self'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
sage: sage_getargspec(I.groebner_basis)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'algorithm', 'deg_bound', 'mult_bound', 'prot'], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=('', None, None, False))
```


In the most difficult cases, `sage_getargspec` actually needs to read the source (using `sage_getsourcelines`) and analyse the function definition. That's why inspect.getargspec is faster (yet a lot less powerful) than sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec.

I've attached a `*.proper.patch`, which is identical except that I removed the "garbage" before "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., I deleted the first line "`exporting patch:`", since Jeroen's current merger rejects such patches.

For now, please make sure all your patches start with "`# HG changeset patch`", i.e., have it on the first line without any preceding messages or whatever.

I've relaxed that in *my version* of the merger, but Jeroen and maybe others are likely to use his more restrictive one.
