I am out of time right now, but I have gotten it down to 21 failures that are all likely from the same root 2 causes. One is needing a coercion, the other is something else that I don't understand at all.

I made a few other changes to try and improve the file, which might have broken things. I did find "one" bug with the cubic quotient `one()` not having coefficients in the right parent.

Hopefully you can find what is going wrong. I will take a look again later in the week.

I think one should exclude `_test_divides, _test_zero` from the `TestSuite`.

I think the `_test_zero` should be fixed as it is an indication of a bigger underlying bug:

```
sage: HQR.zero()
0
sage: bool(HQR.zero())
True
sage: f = HQR.zero()._f; f
0
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_cdvf_with_category.element_class'>
sage: bool(f)
True
sage: F = f.parent()
sage: f == F.zero()
True
sage: f != F.zero()  # it is consistent
False
sage: bool(F.zero())  # but not here
False
```


My guess for the second failure is we are not converting some element to the base ring of the polynomial ring like we should. Possibly from skipping some checks.
