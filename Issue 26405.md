CC:  @embray

This piece in `sage-spkg` is wrong:

```
    # Copy files into $SAGE_LOCAL
    $SAGE_SUDO cp -Rp "$PREFIX/." "$SAGE_LOCAL"
    rm -rf "$SAGE_DESTDIR"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        error_msg "Error copying files for $PKG_NAME."
        exit 1
    fi
```

This is checking for errors from `rm -rf` instead of from the copy operation.
