# Issue 28741: Change "high mem" to "memlimit" when referring to doctesting tags

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28978

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-01-10 00:44:29

Tagging a doctest "high mem" doesn't do anything: it should be tagged "memlimit" instead. But a few places in the Sage code still say "high mem".
