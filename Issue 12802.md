Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @jasongrout

The first patch makes all the `.__attribute` into `._attribute` so that the `Graphics` class can be inherited in the future. This is desirable since all the important functions are present in this class. One will not lose anything in terms of existing functionality.

The second patch does more cleanups, whitespace removal, and refactoring of one big bunch of code which is present twice in `Graphics().matplotlib()`.

Passes all doctests in `devel/sage/sage/plot`. (The patches are created using 5.0-rc0)

In general this looks pretty good, good work on underscores and the refactor looks ok.  The Sage Days 40.5 crowd says "yes!" to making double underscores single underscores.

* Minor but should be done: get rid of backslashes ending lines.  Suggestion is to just enclose things in parentheses for splitting lines.
* You need to doctest your new matplotlib tick formatter.
* I'm not sure why you alphabetized some of the keywords in various places.  It might make more sense to keep ones together that are related - e.g., `vgridlinesstyle` and `hgridlinesstyle` should be next to each other.  I don't think this was an optimal change.

```

2. I removed the backslash and replaced it with simple brackets
3. I had also doctested the new matplotlib function, but it seems that went into the log plot code. Sorry for the mixup. The updated patch (the second patch) contains the doctest now.
4. From the doctests in #4529, I found that there were other functions outside of `sage/plot` that were using attributes of `Graphics` as `_Graphics__object`, etc. All these are fixed now (in the first patch).

Not really worried about patchbot, to be honest.  

Guess you must have made it home... my flight is delayed by a half hour, so I might as well start rebasing all the stuff I reviewed to 5.1.beta1...

Please don't do this, it can only lead to merge conflicts.  Removing whitespace from parts of the code which you edit is fine (even encouraged), but don't just remove all whitespace shotgun-style.
