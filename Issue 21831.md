I'm not convinced about

```
if x == RR('NaN')
```

I would prefer to see a type-specific check. For example, `Integer` can never be `NaN`. And for `float` or `complex`, it seems overkill to involve the coercion model just to check whether the value is `NaN`. And for elements of `RR`, you could use the `is_NaN()` method.
