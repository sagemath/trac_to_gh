Keywords: padic BSD, padic height

Bernadette Perrin-Riou reports two bugs:

One is that this does not work

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("91b")
sage: h = E.padic_height(7,10)
```


The other is that the 2-adic L-series takes gamma to be 1+2 rather than 1+4.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20798
