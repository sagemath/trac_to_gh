# Issue 20561: some bugs in padic BSD

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20798

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2016-06-10 10:27:30

Keywords: padic BSD, padic height

Bernadette Perrin-Riou reports two bugs:

One is that this does not work

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("91b")
sage: h = E.padic_height(7,10)
```


The other is that the 2-adic L-series takes gamma to be 1+2 rather than 1+4.

Here is first step, for the padic_height.

I am not able to know what to do for gamma.

That was quick. I did that part myself already and I am working on the other.

I modified the code for the p-adic L-functions, both ordinary and supersingular. The error bounds should be correct.
