This is hard to reproduce reliably, but can happen if a worker process outlives its deadline and `w.kill()` is called, but the process has exited on its own by the time `killpg()` is called.

I've had this happen a few times on Cygwin where process shutdown tends to take a little longer.

Some of the calls to this `kill` method are wrapped already in a `try`/`except Exception` block. So it seems to be a feature that this would raise an exception if the worker is already dead. I would therefore prefer to just wrap the one remaining call to `kill` in a `try`/`except` block.

~~Although maybe instead of "successful in sending the signal" it should be "successful in sending the signal or is already dead".  After all what I've written will allow other exceptions to be raised.~~

No, I changed my mind. I'll do it the way you suggested.
