Keywords: latex, symbolic expression

Reported by Andy Howell on sage-devel.

Current:

```
sage: h = e^-x
sage: latex(h)
e^{\left(-x\right)}
```


Wish:

```
sage: h = e^-x
sage: latex(h)
e^{-x}
```

Not sure whether the fix belongs in Sage or GiNaC or Pynac. Any insight anyone?

Likewise:

```
sage: a = exp(2*x)
sage: a  # good: we need those parentheses
e^(2*x)
sage: latex(a)  # should skip parentheses
e^{\left(2 \, x\right)}
```

and

```
sage: b = exp(x/2)
sage: b  # good: we need those parentheses
e^(1/2*x)
sage: latex(b)  # should skip parentheses
e^{\left(\frac{1}{2} \, x\right)}
```
