Keywords: pynac

In the current [development version of pynac](https://github.com/pynac/pynac) the evaluation of trigonometric functions has been improved. This enables the following behavior:

```
sage: var('k', domain='integer')
k
sage: sin(k*pi)
0
sage: cos(k*pi)
(-1)^k
sage: sin(1 + 2*k*pi)
sin(1)
sage: tan(k*pi)
0
sage: cos(2*k*pi + pi/3)
1/2
```

and so on. Additionally, this introduces simplification for the complex exponential function:

```
sage: exp(2*k*pi*I)
sage: 1
```

This ticket shall document these changes.

I think "For the sake of simplification, the argument is reduced the period of the complex exponential function" is missing a "modulo" or something like that. Once that is fixed, feel free to set it to positive review yourself.
