CC:  tscrim jdemeyer

Keywords: python3

The tool 2to3 changes the code to the new Py3 syntax. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 30 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16074

The problem is the decorator, because it works in 2 steps:

1. The class is created the usual way.

2. The decorator modifies the class to have a new metaclass.

The problem is that step 1. already fails, so the decorator cannot do anything.
