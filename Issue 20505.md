Checked that the github tarball content is ok. I seem to have made again the chksum from a different tarball in the previous commit. I also have two tarballs as example with the same content and different shasum, so this seems a problem with nondeterministic compression.

IIRC, the checksum also depends on when the tarball was created.

Everything seems to be okay to me.
