What is wrong with the current description? If an old Python is installed, then sage bootstrap downloads and (locally) installs a new python, right? This seems to be a huge enough workaround to justify the terminology "deprecated" (which implies that it does work, but is no longer recommended). Or do you mean something else?

This part of the documentation is for "normal" users right? Then maybe the reference to sage-bootstrap-python is more confusing than helpful for the target group. Personally, I would also add a "Version 3.7 or later is recommended".
