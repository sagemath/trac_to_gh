(split out from #30551)

`sage-bootstrap-python` which has much wider range of supported python versions, including Python >= 2.6 and Python >= 3.4 - according to `build/tox.ini`.

What is wrong with the current description? If an old Python is installed, then sage bootstrap downloads and (locally) installs a new python, right? This seems to be a huge enough workaround to justify the terminology "deprecated" (which implies that it does work, but is no longer recommended). Or do you mean something else?

is Python 2.6 actually tested to work? IMHO asking for 2.7 is fine.

This part of the documentation is for "normal" users right? Then maybe the reference to sage-bootstrap-python is more confusing than helpful for the target group. Personally, I would also add a "Version 3.7 or later is recommended".

I think the phrasing is okay: I think it makes it clear that it is a technical term and people can freely ignore it. I haven't actually tested to see whether Python 2.6 will work, but I think we should merge this. Any objections?
