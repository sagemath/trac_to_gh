This is a problem for system installs. e.g. on sage.math


```
$ sage -sh
$ sage-list-packages optional
Using SAGE Server http://www.sagemath.org//packages
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/share/sage-4.8/local/bin/sage-list-packages", line 21, in <module>
    os.makedirs(SAGE_ROOT_TMP)
  File "/usr/local/share/sage-4.8/local/lib/python/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/share/sage-4.8/tmp'
SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/share/sage-4.8
```


This causes the `optional_packages` function among others to fail.

Yup, looks like it, although our solutions are a bit different (I remove the need for a temp file).
