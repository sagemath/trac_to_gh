Keywords: lcalc spkg

PARI version 2.4.4 (see #11130) no longer has an `allocatemoremem()` function, which `lcalc` uses.  There is a function `allocatemem()` which can be used instead.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11321

Thanks for the patch.

I should point out that I now have a google code page for lcalc:

http://code.google.com/p/l-calc/

(lcalc was taken, so I went with l-calc).

The page has my beta newer version of lcalc, L-1.3
However, Rishikesh's cython wrapper is still being updated for that, so it
won't work within sage with the current wrapper.

I should point out that Lcommandline_elliptic.cc has become part of
the underlying class library and moved to
Lelliptic.cc in version L-1.3

The patch to the Makefile still uses `-lmpir` instead of `-lgmp`. (We always build MPIR with GMP compatibility, as all other packages refer to GMP rather than MPIR.) And the receipt for `all` is still funny, but that's upstream...

I'd quote `$patch` to be on the safe side. Also, the patches are / have to be applied with `-p1` (from `lcalc-*/src/`) rather than `-p0`, which I don't mind, but Jeroen wanted to unify this across spkgs IIRC.

Some files from `src/include/` can also be deleted (and I doubt we have to copy *all* of them to `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/lcalc/`; `L*.h` and `mpfr_mul_d.h` -- included by `Lgmpfrxx.h` -- should suffice):

I wonder if it's worth to run Lcalc's tests from an `spkg-check` file.

I'd *really* appreciate having the changes to spkgs to be "finally" reviewed committed, especially if files get deleted, as is the case here. Also, IMHO commit messages are subject to review as well, no matter if some merge script would add a generic one in case it is missing.

New spkg, same location.  This cases care of *most* of leif's comments.  I believe that the remainder of leif's comments should not prevent a positive review for this ticket.

About committing the changes: I find it very annoying to have to commit the changes everytime I make a change.  If you are happy with the spkg except for the committing of the changes, I can still commit the changes at that point.

You don't have to, unless you publish them. ;-)

And you can always keep an uncommitted copy. I don't think it's much work to commit the changes if you have to create (perhaps upload) and announce a new spkg anyway.

> If you are happy with the spkg except for the committing of the changes, I can still commit the changes at that point.

Well, not committing the changes means *I* have to commit your changes *in your name* (with some random commit message) and repackage the spkg
* in order to really test all changes (as files get deleted upon commit),
* if I want to make some reviewer patch or a (follow-up) spkg based on yours.

The first point is of course more crucial, since not only lazy people might just install and test the spkg as is, such that potential errors will only show up much later. So not committing the changes is IMHO simply bad practice unless the spkg is really and explicitly said to be in some alpha state, most probably not ready and not intended to get merged as is (despite needing review / testing by others), which might be ok in rare cases.

There's a reason the term *commit* is used rather than just e.g. *save changes*, the former implying some confidence or conviction by the author (or committer).

From first glance:
* (GNU) `patch` should be added to the dependencies section.
* This is still in:

```sh
# If SAGE_DEBUG is set either unset (the default), or set to 'yes'
...
   echo >&2 "Code will be built with debugging information present. Set 'SAGE_DEBUG' to 'no' if you don't want that."
   # Actually anything othe than 'yes' will cause 
   # no debugging information to be added.
```

   (As mentioned, I also would add `-g` by default.)
* There's neither a `patches/README.txt` nor a *Patches* section in `SPKG.txt`.
* `success 'install'` should perhaps be `success 'copying header files'`.

The rest looks ok.

I've btw. successfully tested the *previous p7* with PARI 2.5.0.p0 and Sage 4.7.1.rc0 (Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64, GCC 4.5.1), both with our current MPIR and the newer MPIR 2.1.3 from #8664.

`hg remove foo && hg commit` removes `foo` also from the working directory (unless you've already deleted it).

For a reviewer patch it is.

> Basing a new spkg on a not-yet-positively-reviewed skpg is not a very good idea anyway (see #11605 vs #11130).

#11604 was based on #11605 in the hope of (or giving it a chance) getting it into Sage 4.7.1, such that this bug gets fixed in reasonable time (in an official release). #11605 was likely to get merged into 4.7.1 because it is a critical bug, so not basing #11604 on the former would have simply been stupid.

#11130 has the milestone set to Sage 4.7.2 and currently (officially) still needs *work*. (Basing a new spkg on that of #11130 would not have been necessary since the new PARI version fixes the bug anyway. And even if it didn't, you claim above it would have been a bad idea to base a new one on a not yet positively reviewed, as is the case with PARI 2.5.0.p0, more precisely, it even "needs work" as I mentioned above.)

Just remove the *"is set either unset (the default), or"*, add *"or unset it"* to *"Set 'SAGE_DEBUG' to 'no' ..."*, and `s/othe/other/`.

I don't mind not adding `-g` by default here (though it really makes sense, and other packages do this). Of course one can always put `-g` into the "global" `CFLAGS`, but you usually need debugging information when it's "too late". Getting better tracebacks from less experienced users is the main reason. One can always strip the symbols afterwards...

Also, other packages that disable optimization completely (`-O0`) if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` should IMHO issue a warning when doing so.

Did so. I've also made further cosmetic changes to `spkg-install`, and also changed the order of flags in `CFLAGS` etc. such that user settings only get overridden when necessary.

A second reviewer patch is up.

This does not yet fix the hardcoded `g++`, but changes the `pari-2.4.4.patch` such that it will work with older PARI versions, e.g. our current 2.4.3.alpha.* spkgs, as well, so we can in principle remove the dependency on #11130 (and merge it earlier).

Well, it's not too complicated it wasn't worth to remove the dependency, be it for testing / reviewing, or further work on the package. (The new spkg will have other advantages btw.)

But *that's* IMHO something we should report upstream, as it won't be the last time Lcalc will have some PARI version-dependent parts... ;-)

I read through the diff to the spkg, and everything looked reasonable to me.  I applied the new pari stuff (#11330), then build this spkg, and it worked fine, and passed the full test suite (for Sage) after applying it.  

I tried one simple example "by hand" that actually *uses* lcalc, and was not pleased by what happened:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: L = E.lseries()
sage: L.zeros(10)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1030944 (0.983 Mbytes).
[0.000000000, 5.00317001, 6.87039122, 8.01433081, 9.93309835, 10.7751382, 11.7573247, 12.9583864, 15.6038579, 16.1920174]
sage: L.zeros(10)
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1030944 (0.983 Mbytes).
[0.000000000, 5.00317001, 6.87039122, 8.01433081, 9.93309835, 10.7751382, 11.7573247, 12.9583864, 15.6038579, 16.1920174]
```

Basically, every time you use lcalc to do anything with elliptic curve L-series, you get some mysterious warning (of course, really output from PARI).   However, the problem has been in released Sage for a long time, so it should be a separate ticket.    It was in sage-4.7.   That's now #11985.

So I say: positive review for this ticket.   Great work guys for cleaning up all kinds of little issues.  This is not an easy spkg, to put it mildly.
