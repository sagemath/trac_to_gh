# Issue 22677: Symbolic products are currently broken.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: symbolics

The symbolic product is currently broken in Sage :
* It cannot be created in Sage :

```
sage: var("j,p", domain="integer")
sage: X,Y=function("X,Y")
sage: prod(X(j),j,1,p)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 prod(X(j),j,Integer(1),p)

/usr/local/sage-8/src/sage/misc/misc_c.pyx in sage.misc.misc_c.prod (/usr/local/sage-8/src/build/cythonized/sage/misc/misc_c.c:1596)()

     72     """
     73     Return the product of the elements in the list x.

TypeError: prod() takes at most 3 positional arguments (4 given)
sage: product(X(j),j,1,p)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-4d04d74c7489> in <module>()
----> 1 product(X(j),j,Integer(1),p)

NameError: name 'product' is not defined
```

* Creatnig it it by casting a Maxima expression via the library interface gives nonsense :

```
sage: X(j).maxima_methods().prod(j,1,p)
X(j)^p
sage: X(j).maxima_methods().product(j,1,p)
X(j)^p
```

(Note : similar nonsense also happens with sums :

```
sage: X(j).maxima_methods().sum(j,1,p)
p*X(j)
```

)
* But something (what ?) can be created via the Maxima `pexpect` interface :

```
sage: maxima("prod(X(j),j,1,p)").sage().log().log_expand()
sum(log(X(j)), j, 1, p)
```

Wups ! You're right. I oversaw it (and #17502 and #20179) when consulting the [symbolics](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics) page.

Curiosity : why setting the status to `neeeds_review` ?

I want you as the ticket reporter to agree. Could you please add your ticket description to #17505?

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
