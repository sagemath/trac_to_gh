# Issue 15139: Projective Point global_height remove special case for ZZ

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15376

Keywords: sage-days55

global_height in Projective Point needed to make a special case for computing the global height when defined over ZZ, as ZZ lacked global_height. global_height was implemented for ZZ in #15373, so this special case can be removed.

It passed the doc test and the long test.

Functionality still works.
