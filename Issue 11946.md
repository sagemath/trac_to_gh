Beginning with the first 4.8 alpha, the build will fail if the build system is sufficiently fast, and perhaps, with sufficiently many cores available.

The attached log file (from a 4.8.a3 build) shows that the spkg libgpg_error-1.6.p3 blows up because it tries to make a directory that already exists.  Georg Weber (gsw') seems to have an explanation: while the Makefile does check to see that the file exists, if the build is sufficiently parallel, two checks can occur at the same time, see no directory, and then both try to make the directory.  Only one can succeed.

His comment on the list that "hyperthreading" may be the problem, I think, is not the case.  For me, the build fails on a dual 6-core Xeon Mac Pro for "-j24", "-h12", and "-j8".  It succeeds with "-j4".

It appears that the directories are made in a shell file, rather than a Makefile.  If so, the usual "-mkdir" Makefile trick won't work.  However, at least on Mac OS X, using "mkdir -p" will ignore failures because the directory exists.

Is this portable across all the systems we support?  The man page implies that it is.

Thanks for the pointers, Jeroen.
