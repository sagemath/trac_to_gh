Keywords: finite_state_machine, Markov chain

When the probabilities of a Markov chain are variables of a polynomial ring, they may not sum up to one without additional information. Therefore, we now provide a parameter `is_zero`.

Patch is fine, tests pass. Corrected a `==` to a `=` in the docu. Please cross-review and set to positive if okay for you.
