Keywords: p-adics, quadratic forms

Let b be a non square in Q_q (q=2<sup>n</sup>) and a an element of Q_q.

The problem is to find x,y in Q_q such that x<sup>2</sup>- b y<sup>2</sup>2 =a i.e. solving the norm equation N(x + sqrt(b) y)=a. I have used it in order to find isotropic vectors for quadratic forms with coefficients in Q_q. But it is also interesting in order to compute the Hasse-Witt invariant of quadratic forms. I have a draft of code that I need to adapt to the coding standards of sage.

Here is my draft of code :


```python

"""

"""
def teichmuller_mod_four(x):
    R=parent(x)
    x0=x.residue()
    r=x0.parent().degree()
    return R(x0^(2^(r-2)))^4

"""
Mod 4 norm equation solver
- input : a, b
- output : alpha, beta such that alpha^2 - b*beta^2=a mod 4
Idea of the algorithm :
We reprents elements of Z_(2^r)/4 as Witt vectors i.e as couples (x_0, x_1) of elements of
F_(2^r) with laws given by :
 (x_0, x_1) + (y_0, y_1) = (x_0 + y_0,  x_1 + y_1 + x_0*y_0)
  (x_0, x_1) - (y_0, y_1) = (x_0 + y_0,  x_1 + y_1 + x_0*y_0 + y_0^2)
  (x_0, x_1) * (y_0, y_1) = (x_0*y_0,  x_0^2*y_1 + y_0^2*x_1)
The equation we want to solve can be written :
 (alpha,0)^2 - (b_0,b_1) * (beta,0)^2 = (a_0,a_1)
This gives :
    b_0*beta^2 = alpha^2 + a_0
    b_1*beta^4 = a_1 + a_0*alpha^2 + a_0^2
    and we find finally if b1!=0
    beta^4+a0*b0/b1*beta^2+a1/b1=0
    One can find beta by solving an Artin-Schreier equation. Then
    alpha = sqrt(b_0) beta +sqrt(a_0)
And we can compute a_0, a_1, b_0, b1 with :
  a_0 = a (mod 2)  ;  sqrt(a_1) = ([a] - a)/2  (mod 2)
  b_0 = b (mod 2)  ;  sqrt(b_1) = ([b] - b)/2  (mod 2)

I would suggest to implement instead a function that solves the equation `a x^2 + b y^2 = 1` which is related to the Hilbert symbol.

You could also have a look at `arith/misc.py` (line 3944-4045) and `rings/number_field/number_field.py` (line 8937-9165).
