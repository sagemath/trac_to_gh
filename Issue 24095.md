Reported at [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39987/change-precision-of-complex_roots/?answer=39990#post-id-39990):


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: poly = x^7 - 6*x^6 + 15*x^5 - 20*x^4 + 15*x^3 - 6*x^2 + x
sage: poly.roots(ring=CC)
PariError: overflow in expo()
```


Same with, say, `RealField(123)`, no problem with non-MPFR rings.

Seems severe enough to be marked as blocker, please change if you do not agree.
