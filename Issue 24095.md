Reported at [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39987/change-precision-of-complex_roots/?answer=39990#post-id-39990):


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: poly = x^7 - 6*x^6 + 15*x^5 - 20*x^4 + 15*x^3 - 6*x^2 + x
sage: poly.roots(ring=CC)
PariError: overflow in expo()
```


Same with, say, `RealField(123)`, no problem with non-MPFR rings.

Seems severe enough to be marked as blocker, please change if you do not agree.

Changing keywords from "" to "cypari2, pari".

Ordinary bugs are not blockers...

Is this fix very important to you? Should we fix this bug in Sage right now or is it fine to wait for a future PARI/GP upgrade?

This will be fixed in Sage by the next PARI upgrade.
