Version 0.11.0 of scipy was released on September 26, 2012. We should update: among other things, the new version builds out of the box on OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion.

The new version has two changes which affect doctests and Sage library code:

- the "order" argument for the Pade approximation for matrix exponentiation has been deprecated and no longer has any effect (except to print a deprecation message). So this requires fixing a doctest or two. I also removed any use of this argument from the Sage code.

- the function `stats.ttest_ind` seems to return its output in a slightly different format. So another doctest needs to be changed.

New spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/scipy-0.11.0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/scipy-0.11.0.spkg)

I assume the Sage library patch must be applied too?

No, I don't think there is any other patches to be applied.
Actaully, `trac_13541-doctest.patch` is misnamed. It contains patches to the Sage library, too.

I meant: the patch must be applied in addition to the new spkg.

Oh yes, you are right. I didn't notice you changed the ticket description accordingly...
