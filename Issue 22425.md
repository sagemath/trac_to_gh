# Issue 22425: Fold farey.pxd into farey_symbol.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22662

Original creator: jdemeyer

Unlike other `.pxd` files, the file `farey.pxd` is _not_ meant as public header. For this reason, we move its contents to the file `farey_symbol.pyx`, which is the only place where it is used.
