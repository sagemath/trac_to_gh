Keywords: optional packages, Stein-Watkins database

The documentation for one of the Stein-Watkins database functions appears to have a typo.  Specifically, the current documentation here:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/stein_watkins.html

says

The command SteinWatkinsPrimeData(n) returns an iterator over the curves in the nth Stein-Watkins prime table, which contains prime conductor elliptic curves of conductor between n10^6 and (n+1)10^6.

Unless the function or the database has changed recently, I believe the 10^6 should be 10^8.  At least on my home installation of Sage 8.7, when I run SteinWatkinsPrimeData(0), I get conductors up to 10^8.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28598
