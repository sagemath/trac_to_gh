# Issue 28361: Documentation error for Stein-Watkins database

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28598

Original creator: kimball

Original creation time: 2019-10-12 20:46:31

Keywords: optional packages, Stein-Watkins database

The documentation for one of the Stein-Watkins database functions appears to have a typo.  Specifically, the current documentation here:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/stein_watkins.html

says

The command SteinWatkinsPrimeData(n) returns an iterator over the curves in the nth Stein-Watkins prime table, which contains prime conductor elliptic curves of conductor between n10^6 and (n+1)10^6.

Unless the function or the database has changed recently, I believe the 10^6 should be 10^8.  At least on my home installation of Sage 8.7, when I run SteinWatkinsPrimeData(0), I get conductors up to 10^8.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Changing keywords from "optional packages, Stein-Watkins database" to "optional packages, Stein-Watkins database, beginner".

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage

In the raw data files, the documentation of files p.n says:

```
  p.n   -- curves between n*10^8 and (n+1)*10^8 with prime conductor
```

so it looks as if the suggested correction is good.

By the way, the Stein-Watkins database does not contain *all* curves in the range, just the ones they found using a search which was not intended to give complete lists.  Since then, Bennett, Gherga and Rechnitzer (see https://www.adelagherga.ca/research/BeGhRe3.pdf) have  a list of all curves of prime conductor up to 10<sup>10</sup>.  So it would be possible to make an optional package from that data too (or instead).  For primes up to 3*10<sup>8</sup> I have computed all the additional data as for my own curve collection, and those are in the LMFDB -- but 10<sup>10</sup> is a lot larger than 3*10<sup>8</sup>.

Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Changing status from needs_info to needs_review.
