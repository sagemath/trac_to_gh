> Is this better?

Much better! ;-)

A question though: what's the point of 

```
    TensorField.copy_from(self, other)
```
 
in `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()` ?
Actually, the action of `TensorField.copy_from` amounts to copying the restrictions, but the restrictions are deleted by the subsequent call:

```
    FreeModuleTensor.copy_from(self, other)
```

due to 

```        
    self._del_derived()
```

in `FreeModuleTensor.copy_from()`. 

In view of this, I would simply delete `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()`, so that `copy_from()` in `TensorFieldParal` is inherited from `FreeModuleTensor`.

A copy of the restrictions even for `TensorFieldParal` would be convenient, wouldn't it?

No, the affected files are untouched in #28600 and #28159. I rather think it's connected to #28562?

Which code lines cause a merge conflict anyway?

I don't think so, since #28562 is not merged yet. Note that #28159 is touching `tensorfield.py`, as the current ticket.

It will be easy to see them when the develop branch is released (as 9.0.beta3).

> Merge still fails. Is it possible to see the conflict files/lines?

Sorry I haven't seen your message before pushing the new branch; it seems we were working on solving the conflict at the same time ;-). 

The general method I am using to see the conflicting files/lines is the following one:
- start from a clean develop branch (i.e. 9.0.beta3 in the present case)
- do 
  {{{
  git checkout -b set_restriction-28628
  git pull trac u/gh-DeRhamSource/tensor_fields__set_restriction_behaviour
  }}}
This generates an error message, stating that there is a conflict in `tensorfield.py`.
Edit the latter to fix the conflict and do `git add tensorfield.py`, then `git commit`, etc.

However, you solved the merge conflict and I'd say, we take your branch, now.
