Thanks for opening the ticket and implementing the fix (the introduction of `copy_from` seems a good idea). However I don't think that you should add the optional argument `del_restrictions` in `TensorField._del_derived`. At first glance, this makes this method on the same footing than `TensorFieldParal._del_derived`, which has such an argument. However, `TensorField` and `TensorFieldParal` are not symmetrical as far as restrictions are concerned (see Sec. 3.5 of [these notes](https://doi.org/10.5802/ccirm.26)):
- for a `TensorFieldParal`, the primary data are the components w.r.t. to vector frames on its domain, stored in the dict `_components`; the restrictions are derived quantities, which can be reconstructed at any time from  `_components`
- for a `TensorField`, the primary data are the restrictions to subdomains; they are not derived quantities; deleting them in `_del_derived()` would erase essential piece of information on the tensor field

Actually, I'm aware of that and definitely see your point. Though, as one can see in `add_expr_by_continuation` (and now `copy_from`), this behaviour is wanted at some point, even for `TensorField` objects. For that reason, I put `del_restrictions=False` as default, so that the previous code is not affected at all.

If you don't want to have this snippet in `_del_derived`, where it would make sense in my opinion, I'd suggest a new method `_del_restrictions` for it is used quite often. This simplifies future modifications on this matter (if needed).

What do you say?


---

Comment by @DeRhamSource created at 2019-10-18 15:54:46

Ah! For `add_expr_by_continuation` you want exactly the behaviour you explained, of course. Sorry! However, imho the modifications above make things easier and the code more elegant and consistent.

Much better! ;-)

A question though: what's the point of 

```
    TensorField.copy_from(self, other)
}}} 
in `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()` ?
Actually, the action of `TensorField.copy_from` amounts to copying the restrictions, but the restrictions are deleted by the subsequent call:
{{{
    FreeModuleTensor.copy_from(self, other)
}}}
due to 
{{{        
    self._del_derived()
}}}
in `FreeModuleTensor.copy_from()`. 

In view of this, I would simply delete `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()`, so that `copy_from()` in `TensorFieldParal` is inherited from `FreeModuleTensor`.

Ah! Yes! The order should be switched then, right?

A copy of the restrictions even for `TensorFieldParal` would be convenient, wouldn't it?

Yes if you would like to maintain `TensorFieldParal.copy_from()` with the copies of the restrictions.
> A copy of the restrictions even for `TensorFieldParal` would be convenient, wouldn't it?
I am not so sure: for `TensorFieldParal`, restrictions are derived quantities, which can be easily reconstructed at any time if necessary. Not copying them makes `copy_from()` faster. If we have `a.copy_from(b)` with restrictions of `b` having been constructed for whatever reasons, it could be that in the future use of `a`, no restriction will be invoked. So I would vote for removing `copy_from()` from `TensorFieldParal` class, keeping it only in `FreeModuleTensor`. This makes the code shorter and clearer: `copy_from()` does not copy the derived quantities, whatever their nature.

Okay, that sounds reasonable. I will work on this tomorrow.

By the way, characteristic classes are almost finished. They come with a _very_ rudimentary version of bundle connections. But I have already plans for full bundle connection support. Though, this has to wait since my master thesis deadline runs out soon.

Best wishes,
Michael

> Merge conflict

I guess this is a conflict with one of the recently merged manifold tickets, #28600 or #28159 (more probably the latter). The easiest way to solve it would be to wait for the 9.0.beta3 release...


---

Comment by @DeRhamSource created at 2019-10-24 09:50:44

No, the affected files are untouched in #28600 and #28159. I rather think it's connected to #28562?

Which code lines cause a merge conflict anyway?

I don't think so, since #28562 is not merged yet. Note that #28159 is touching `tensorfield.py`, as the current ticket.

It will be easy to see them when the develop branch is released (as 9.0.beta3).

Well, okay. But this is just one line with a typo in a very different line. However, I think you're right.

Merge still fails. Is it possible to see the conflict files/lines?


---

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2019-10-27 13:40:28

The merge conflict with Sage 9.0.beta3 is solved in the above branch. I have also added the copy of the attribute `_is_zero` in `copy_from()`, as well as some autorship lines. Do you agree?

Sorry I haven't seen your message before pushing the new branch; it seems we were working on solving the conflict at the same time ;-). 

The general method I am using to see the conflicting files/lines is the following one:
- start from a clean develop branch (i.e. 9.0.beta3 in the present case)
- do 
  {{{
  git checkout -b set_restriction-28628
  git pull trac u/gh-DeRhamSource/tensor_fields__set_restriction_behaviour
  }}}
This generates an error message, stating that there is a conflict in `tensorfield.py`.
Edit the latter to fix the conflict and do `git add tensorfield.py`, then `git commit`, etc.

That's a good hint for the future. I just thought, you were fast! :D

However, you solved the merge conflict and I'd say, we take your branch, now.

It seems there is a merge conflict between 9.0.beta3 and #28564; so if you want to practice...
