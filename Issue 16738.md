The discrete Gaussian module relies on `SAGE_ROOT` in `nodule_list,py` but it shouldn't. See comment in #16968.

I'll organize a push as soon as I have dealt with another bit of ironing with ntl 6.2.1 on Gentoo.

Even the dependencies should be automatically picked up by Cython.

Sorry, that's not true, only the dependencies which are mentioned in Cython files are automatically picked up, which is `dgs.h` only.

OK, yes indeed dgs.h only and it includes the three other headers that need to be in depend.
