Keywords: cone, fan, negative

it would be useful to be able to write -C and -F
for the cone obtained by negating the rays of a cone, and same for a fan.

That would be nice, but:
1. The cone negation method is in a wrong class and constructs a wrong object.
2. The cone and fan actual classes are very picky about the input - rays have to be immutable, as described in the documentation. Either run a loop to make them immutable or use `Cone` and `Fan` constructors that take care of it, `check=False` would make sense, of course.

Thanks for your quick reaction.

I think I have taken care of point 1.

Concerning point 2, I am not sure to see the point. It seems that the current code does work. Could you give me a case where the opposite fan or cone (as build now) misbehaves ?

By the way, I would love to have a method to obtain the common refinment of two fans. Do you see an easy way to do that using existing code ?
