On WSL, `bdist_wheel` sometimes encounters strange permission errors (when the source folder is a Windows folder mounted in WSL), see https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/258. In the linked issue, a solution is described by changing the permissions for authenticated users, but it didn't worked for me. Thus I've implemented the workaround mentioned in https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/258#issuecomment-548148041 and specified an explicit bdist directory in the Linux system.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31002

Thanks for tracking down this problem. 

I don't think using `~/temp/` is a good idea, though.
I think a better solution would be to use the command `mktemp -d` to create a directory in the system directory for temporary files.

Probably. If you think this is a problem, I would like to ask you to implement your suggestion with the `sage-dist-helpers`. My shell knowledge is sadly not good enough for this.

Nevertheless I have implemented this function. Better to have it in one place.

I have only changed it in the pillow install script, where it seems to work.

Could you change the other ones?
