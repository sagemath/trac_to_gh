Shouldn't the tarball be pari-2.10.0-xxx rather than 2.9.0?

OK, can you explain to me how sage will know to upgrade from 2.9.3 to 2.9.0-xxxxxx? Am I missing something there about the build system.

Even if the version number doesn't matter so much, because sage builds and rebuilds stuff on version change, whatever they are, my sanity says the version number should be higher. Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/) and of course all the pari-2.9 releases have the same soname but this one will have different one.

Please change the version name.

It just does. Sage doesn't have a concept of lower/higher version numbers, only of _changed_ version numbers.

> Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/)

I wonder how they do that. I am doing as documented to create a PARI tarball (`make distrib`) and the version number `pari-2.9.0-1234-gd1d0c49` is what comes out of the *official upstream script*.

So I would argue that the bug is upstream then.

OK, I will take a copy of the snapshot in https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/ then

OK, so that's why there is not an `spkg-src` either. Yes, sounds like a bug upstream then. Now that you have changed to an "official" upstream snapshot I will have to revise my own ebuild to be on the same level.

Ok so upstream has a nice explanation for the 2.9.0/2.10 thing. Do we need to wait for upstream answer to the other bug?

That is a new doctest which didn't exist when this ticket was created.

Thanks for the notice on the Judson book fix.  I'll tidy it up when the book is updated, but for now the fix is fine.

Volker, are you sure this is from this ticket? See #23962 (which was first noticed on #23881).


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2017-10-04 06:50:44

Well the failure is random so its hard to be 100% sure, but I saw it twice with this ticket and never without.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-10-04 08:10:40

In any case, it is plausible that it's because of this ticket since PARI/GP is used in that computation.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-10-04 09:56:48

I know how to reproduce #23962 and it is unrelated to PARI/GP.
