# Issue 24901: Make pkgconf an order-only dependency

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25138

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-10 16:02:06

Of the 8 packages that explicitly depend on pkgconf, (barely) the majority of them list pkgconf as an order-only prerequisite, which makes sense.  However, these three packages did not, albeit not for any particular reason I can tell.

I don't think updating pkgconf should necessitate rebuilding any of these packages and their dependencies.
