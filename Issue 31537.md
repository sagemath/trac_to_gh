In version 9.3.rc5, the call `PrimitiveGroup(2500, 1)` raises a `NotImplementedError: Only the primitive groups of degree less than 2500 are available in GAP's database`, even though the primitive groups are available up to degree 4095.

The exception is raised by the wrong degree limit in line 2489 of local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py

Apparently, there (and at a few places in the doc string), 2500 need to be replaced by 4096.

(Sorry, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the development process to correctly supply a patch.)

I don't think there is a need to hardcode anything. It would be perfectly fine to let GAP handle the input and let the interface forward the error if any

```
sage: libgap.PrimitiveGroup(10000, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):

We should clarify that in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#reporting-bugs

> Though there should be proper credit for the reporter, especially bugs!

Fully agree.
