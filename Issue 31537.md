# Issue 31537: Wrong degree limit in PrimitiveGroup()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31774

Original creator: @ypfmde

Original creation time: 2021-05-03 18:15:15

CC:  slelievre

In version 9.3.rc5, the call `PrimitiveGroup(2500, 1)` raises a `NotImplementedError: Only the primitive groups of degree less than 2500 are available in GAP's database`, even though the primitive groups are available up to degree 4095.

The exception is raised by the wrong degree limit in line 2489 of local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py

Apparently, there (and at a few places in the doc string), 2500 need to be replaced by 4096.

(Sorry, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the development process to correctly supply a patch.)

I don't think there is a need to hardcode anything. It would be perfectly fine to let GAP handle the input and let the interface forward the error if any

```
sage: libgap.PrimitiveGroup(10000, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
GAPError: Error, Primitive groups of degree 10000 are not known!
```

Actually the ticket was only "almost perfect" :) the "Author Field" is intended for the author of the patch not for the reporter. Though there should be proper credit for the reporter, especially bugs!

We should clarify that in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#reporting-bugs

> Though there should be proper credit for the reporter, especially bugs!

Fully agree.

as the reporter suggested a fix, he's a co-author.

That looks like a perfectly good solution.
