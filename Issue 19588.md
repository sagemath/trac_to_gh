We fasten the comparison code and fix the following for the Universal cyclotomic field:

```
sage: CIF(E(3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexIntervalFieldElement
```

Even though it looks like the float lost precision, it is in fact closer to the actual value:

```
sage: float(1.002000)  # Trailing 0's are removed
1.002
sage: x = E(7) + E(7,6)
sage: x.n(1000)
1.2469796037174670610500097680084...
```

So LGTM.
