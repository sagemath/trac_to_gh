Not sure it is due to the patch but

```
$ sage -t polymake.py --optional=sage,polymake
**********************************************************************
File "polymake.py", line 814, in sage.interfaces.polymake.Polymake._eval_line
Failed example:
    p.N_LATTICE_POINTS                # optional - polymake
Expected:
    used package latte
      LattE (Lattice point Enumeration) is a computer software dedicated to the
      problems of counting lattice points and integration inside convex polytopes.
