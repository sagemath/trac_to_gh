After #11575 was positively reviewed the PolyBoRi 0.7.1 spkg was improved in #11906. 

So we have to merge the recent changes from http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.1.p7.spkg into http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.0.p1.spkg

The new spkg is here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.0.p2.spkg
It also utilizes __M4RI_CFLAGS when available.

Due to change in the 0.7.1 spkg, I had to rebundle another spkg (at the same place above).

The new spkg builds, installs and passes all tests on SuSE Enterprise 11 (with SP1) on amd64 and OS X 10.5 ppc.

How is this related to #12750 and #12655?

The spkg here should get rebased on that of #12750, to a p3.

If #12655 (currently needing work) gets merged before this one, this ticket can be closed, as upgrading to 0.8.1 would also fix the issue, if I'm not completely wrong.

So can we close this ticket now?
