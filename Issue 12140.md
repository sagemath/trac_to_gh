From the spkg-install of ATLAS:

```
# we need to disable parallel builds
os.environ['MAKE'] += ' -j1'
```
but later in the same file:

```
rc = os.system('make shared cshared')
```

The latter command doesn't see the "-j1", therefore might be built in parallel.

I'm making this a sage-4.8 blocker, since this causes the Solaris linker to hang.

I don't understand why calling `make` builds in parallel here; Does `MAKEFLAGS` contain a `-j` option (we don't set it by default)? Calling `$MAKE` is the right thing to do to pass through other options but again I don't understand how it fixes the Solaris issue.
