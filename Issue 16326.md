Doctests in `function_fields/` pass again. Let's see what the patchbots think.

`@`saraedum, could you please take care of your patchbot multscher, that misbehaves currently ?

I found not other way to contact you.

I was able to successfully compile this ticket. This ticket also passed the doctests. I am definitely a newbie, so I wasn't able to confidently check everything on the reviewer checklist, but this ticket satisfied what I could check.

Thanks for having a look :) That sounds good enough for me.

hwsmith: What is missing for you from the checklist? You can put your name into the "Reviewers" field in any case?
