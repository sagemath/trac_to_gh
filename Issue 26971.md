Keywords: meataxe comparison

Currently, when comparing two matrices of type `Matrix_gfpn_dense`, the data of both is translated into a python string and then the two python strings are compared. That's very inefficient (because of copying data).

I suggest to use the upstream matrix comparison function instead.

Now I am totally puzzled. I expected that the upstream function would be a lot faster than Sage's `_cmp_` method (which **copies** matrix data into a string and then compares the strings). However, Sage's comparison performs like this:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 1000,2000)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 1000,2000)
sage: C = copy(A)
sage: %timeit A == B
The slowest run took 17.06 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 699 ns per loop
sage: %timeit A == C
1 loop, best of 3: 1.29 s per loop
```

whereas the upstream function performs like this:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 1000,2000)
sage: B = random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 1000,2000)
sage: C = copy(A)
sage: %timeit A == B
The slowest run took 25.28 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 755 ns per loop
sage: %timeit A == C
1 loop, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
```

In `_cmp_`, we currently have

```python
        d1 = <char*>(self.Data.Data)
        d2 = <char*>(N.Data.Data)
        cdef bytes s1, s2
        s1 = PyBytes_FromStringAndSize(d1, self.Data.RowSize * self.Data.Nor)
        s2 = PyBytes_FromStringAndSize(d2, N.Data.RowSize * N.Data.Nor)
```

The docs for `PyBytes_FromStringAndSize` say

```
Return a new bytes object with a copy of the string v as value and length len
```

So, it's a copy.

There is another point: meataxe stores a matrix row in `long*`, i.e., in a block of memory whose length is a multiple of `sizeof(long)`. Therefore, there are padding bytes. These bytes are supposed to be zero.

Upstream apparently did not trust that the padding bytes are zero, and in fact I recall that during development of the first version of `Matrix_gfpn_dense`, non-zero padding bytes originally created trouble, however in the last couple of years I have never seen a non-zero padding byte again.

Therefore, I do believe that non-zero padding bytes was a bug that upstream (i.e., myself) fixed some years ago, and we can now trust that they are zero.

By consequence, we have the following possibilities to compare matrices:

1. Copy the whole chunk of memory to bytes, using `PyBytes_FromStringAndSize`, and compare the bytes. That's what we currently do.
2. Do not copy the whole chunk of memory, but instead compare chunks of memory by `memcmp`: Size `FfCurrentRowSize*self.Data.Nor`.
3. Do not look at the padding bytes, but loop through the rows of the matrix and use `memcmp` for comparison: `self.Data.Nor` times `FfCurrentRowSizeIo`, using `FfStepRow` for cycling through the rows.
4. Call the upstream function `MatCompare`, which basically is the same as 3., but uses `MatGetPtr` to access the rows.
5. Create a new upstream version of SharedMeatAxe, which replaces `MatGetPtr` by `FfStepPtr` when cycling through the rows of a matrix.

About `FfStepRow` versus `MatGetPtr`: The former advances an existing pointer by `FfCurrentRowSize`, hence, only involves a single addition. The latter directly accesses the i-th row of a matrix M, which means to compute `M->Data + i*M->RowSize`.

Apparently when looping through the rows of M, `MatGetPtr` has overhead compared with `FfStepRow`.

EDIT: Or create a new upstream version that uses `FfStepRow` for cycling, but is less paranoid about non-zero padding bytes and uses `memcpm` in `MatCompare`.

I searched the upstream sources for `MatGetPtr` and found that it is quite often used in cases for which `FfStepPtr` might be more suitable. Changing ALL these places would involve some work.
