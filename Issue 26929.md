# Issue 26929: remove deprecated classes NetworkXGraphDeprecated and NetworkXDiGraphDeprecated

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27166

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-29 16:08:30

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

The 2 classes contains a deprecation warning since at least #10900 (from 2011), and classes `XGraph` and `XDiGraph` have been replaced by class `MultiGraph` and `MultiDiGraph` in `NetworkX 0.99` released in 2008.
So it's time to remove these classes from file `src/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.pyx`.

Furthermore, this fix the doctest error with py3 in `graph_backends.pyx`.
