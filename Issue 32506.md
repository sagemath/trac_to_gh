The code in `src/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py` contains a few expressions of the form `(x.conjugate() * y).reduced_trace()`, which is in fact equal to `x.pair(y)`. This patch replaces the ad-hoc code by `.pair()`.

This is more conceptual and fixes the weird display of the default argument here:â€‚

several precision failures in `src/sage/modular/modform/numerical.py`

could be related to the changes made here ?

Hm, the failures don't show up in the second patchbot run and there's not a single occurrence of the strings `quatalg` or `quaternion` in the entire `modular/modform/` directory... I'd say this seems unrelated.
