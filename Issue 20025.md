A couple minor things here

- need to do input checking on both the codomains of the points and the number of points entered


```
P1.<a,b,c>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
points_source=[P1([1,4,1]),P([1,2,2]),P1([3,5,1]),P1([1,-1,1])]
points_target=[P([5,-2,7]),P([3,-2,3]),P([6,-5,9]), P([3,6,7])]
```



```
P1.<a,b,c>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
points_source=[P1([1,4,1]),P1([1,2,2]),P1([3,5,1]),P1([13,5,-1]),P1([3,25,4])]
points_target=[P1([5,-2,7]),P1([3,-2,3]),P1([6,-5,9]), P1([3,6,7])]
P1.point_transformation_matrix(points_source, points_target)
```


- for the lines


```
w = v.rational_points(bound=n)
if len(w) == 0:
    raise ValueError (" no conjugation found, over the %s" %r)
```


 you should remove the bound=n, and I don't think you need the if/raise as if you pass the linearly independent check you will have a unique solution defined over the base_ring

Functionality looks fine, just two documentation things.

- The description of the function needs improvement.

- one of the examples is missing a blank line after the :: so is not formatting correctly
