# Issue 28035: Can't scale vector space morphisms on the left

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28272

Presumably this should work, since somebody implemented it on the right,


```
sage: from sage.modules.vector_space_morphism import VectorSpaceMorphism
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ,2)
sage: f = VectorSpaceMorphism(V.Hom(V), identity_matrix(QQ,2))
sage: f*(1/2)
Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
[1/2   0]
[  0 1/2]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
```


just not on the left:


```
sage: (1/2)*f
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Rational Field' and 'Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations) from Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field to Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field'
```

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I implemented a `_rmul_` and `_lmul_`. While I was at it, I also changed the `_add_` and `_sub_` to use the coercion model.

this triggers failing doctests, and worse, segmentation faults

Indeed, debugging will be needed for moving `__add__` and `__sub__` to the coercion model. So here is a version with the minimal change for the left/right action of the base ring. Let's see if that works better.

still has segfaults.

Hmm...I don't know. It will take some deeper debugging to figure it out. Unfortunately I don't have time right now to do so. `:/` If someone else can take over, please do so.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
