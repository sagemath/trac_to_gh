LGTM except for the one thing:

```diff
@@ -277,7 +278,7 @@ class MaximaAbstract(ExtraTabCompletion, Interface):
             ['gcd', 'gcdex', 'gcfactor', 'gctime']
         """
         if verbose:
-            print s,
+            print(s)
             sys.stdout.flush()
         # in Maxima 5.19.1, apropos returns all commands that contain
         # the given string, instead of all commands that start with
```

as it changes the output to have a new line. It's a marginal issue at best, but I think it would be better to keep the same formatting as before:

```python
print(s, end=" ")
```

Feel free to set a positive review with or without this change.

how would you do that in a way that works both in py2 and py3 ?

Just for reference, it is in the code, so the `from __future__ import print_function` makes it 2/3 compatible.
