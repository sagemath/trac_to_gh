# Issue 30622: Add more debian system package information, including packages without spkg-configure.m4

... including for packages that we cannot use (yet)

This is for several purposes:
 - Test proper isolation of our build (i.e., the presence of unused system packages do not break our build) using `tox -e ...-maximal`
 - Testing sagelib without Sage-the-distribution (similar to #28745/#30845 for conda)
 - Preparation for tickets that will add `spkg-configure.m4`

(from #30371)

Some unfinished spkg-configure (#27330) tickets (#29542, #29631, #29644) may have this system package info already

Tobias, if you have a chance, could you prepare a branch for this?

Yes, but only after #30673 is merged - otherwise working on new branches is really cumbersome.

You can just make it a dependency & merge the branch

I've added the package information added in #30371. Matthias, feel free to take it over from here, if further changes are necessary.
