# Issue 21380: tower of p-adic fields not working correctly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21617

Keywords: p-adics, padic, p-adic

When I create the following p-adic tower of fields, p = 5, K is an Eisenstein extension of Q5, and L is an unramified extension of K, 5 is not represented correctly in the field L and arithmetic does not appear to work as it should in L.  

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: C.<zeta> = NumberField(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)
sage: g = (zeta - 1).minpoly()
sage: g
x^4 + 5*x^3 + 10*x^2 + 10*x + 5
sage: Q5 = Qp(5, 10)
sage: R.<X> = PolynomialRing(Q5)
sage: g = R(g)
sage: K.<a> = Q5.extension(g)
sage: S.<Y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(Y^2 - Y - 4)
sage: K(5)

Changing keywords from "p-adics, padic, p-adic" to "p-adics, p-adic, padic, padics".

Unfortunately, towers of p-adic fields are not yet supported.  There has been some renewed activity recently.  If you're interested in helping out, feel free to join the sage-padics googlegroup.  We're going to be meeting every week or two on IRC to work, and one of the top priorities is general extensions of p-adic fields.

Changing keywords from "p-adics, p-adic, padic, padics" to "padics, padicIMA".
