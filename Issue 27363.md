# Issue 27363: Adding parameter by_weight in min_spanning_tree()

Like in shortest_path we have parameters by_weight and weight_function to use the edge weights.
But in min_spanning_tree we first have to do g.is_weighted(True) which is clearly an extra step to do.
This ticket aims at unifying the usage of weights by introducing by_weight parameter in min_spanning_tree, if True, the edges in the graph will be weighted, otherwise all edges will have weight 1.

I have fixed error msg and improved networkx'x usage too.

no need to create the list `E = list(networkx.minimum_spanning_edges(G, data=False))`. E can be an iterator.
