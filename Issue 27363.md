Like in shortest_path we have parameters by_weight and weight_function to use the edge weights.
But in min_spanning_tree we first have to do g.is_weighted(True) which is clearly an extra step to do.
This ticket aims at unifying the usage of weights by introducing by_weight parameter in min_spanning_tree, if True, the edges in the graph will be weighted, otherwise all edges will have weight 1.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27600
