A good chance for me to get used to the new workflow.  Obviously it's fine, but better make sure it applies :)  Hopefully you'll hear back before my computer runs out of juice.

Testing the sage -dev comments:

Looks good, and seems to apply to whatever version of Sage I just downloaded.

Hmm, why do I get this "Modified" thing when I use the sage -dev facility, but not the web interface?
