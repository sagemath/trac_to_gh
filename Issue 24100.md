# Issue 24100: Remove the pickle jar

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24337

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-12-07 11:41:51

As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/dZwxUCNEZWk/joIzOT0aBAAJ the pickle jar no longer serves the purpose that it was created for. So better remove it, as it is currently only an obstacle to development.

Now that this is gone, perhaps we could deprecate and/or remove the `sage.misc.explain_pickle` module.  It's a nice utility for debugging pickling issues, but less relevant if we're no longer going to guarantee pickle preservation between versions.

It's still relevant for debugging pickling issues within one Sage version I suppose.
