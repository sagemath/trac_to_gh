Follow up from #29784:

Also the reviewer's checklist https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html
should be updated using material from https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReviewChecklist  and that wiki page replaced by a link to the manual.

It could also explain when make ends in  Error building Sage, what to do next


Also should explain `configure --enable-editable` (https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Editable_.28.22in-place.22.2C_.22develop.22.29_installs_of_the_Sage_library)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33088
