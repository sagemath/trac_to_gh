# Issue 32851: More updates for installation and developer guides

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33088

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-12-27 21:16:27

CC:  @tobiasdiez tmonteil slabbe dimpase yzh isuruf

Follow up from #29784:

Also the reviewer's checklist https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html
should be updated using material from https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReviewChecklist  and that wiki page replaced by a link to the manual.

It could also explain when make ends in  Error building Sage, what to do next


Also should explain `configure --enable-editable` (https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Editable_.28.22in-place.22.2C_.22develop.22.29_installs_of_the_Sage_library)

On page 5 of the age Developer's Guide pdf, in the section "branching out":

```
[user@localhost]$ git branch
* develop
  master
```

This probably should be `[user`@`localhost sage]`, to be consistent with the other boxes.

Good idea, do you want to push a commit?


---

Comment by yzh created at 2022-04-05 20:11:51

Same question about 

```
[user@localhost]$ git branch 
  develop
* last_twin_prime master
  master
```

on page 6

I pushed a commit 9cef218fd4, but I don't see it on the ticket. Where could it go?

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-06 10:02:05

can we have this:

```
for Sage 9.2, these modules are as follows: ``sqlite3``, ``ctypes``, ``math``,
...
```

up to date? (i.e. for the upcoming 9.6)

By the way, what's the state of building Sage on macOS with Homebrew tools only? Can it be done?
Or it still needs a part of xcode installed (headers?) ?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2022-04-06 10:06:23

Other than comment:47, looks good.

Homebrew itself requires CLT. See https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements and the README.md modified in this ticket.

Slight related: with conda you only need the SDK (headers) from xcode.
