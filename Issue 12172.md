We do have an optional GINV SPKG which comes with its own Python interface but no interface to it from Sage.

With the attached patch, this now works.

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(GF(127),order='degrevlex')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Katsura(P)
sage: I.groebner_basis(algorithm='ginv')            ...
[z^3 + 22*z^2 - 55*y + 49*z, y^2 - 26*z^2 - 51*y + 51*z, y*z + 52*z^2 + 38*y + 25*z, x + 2*y + 2*z - 1]
```

Please use the last patch, the 1st one has non-ASCII chars in it.
