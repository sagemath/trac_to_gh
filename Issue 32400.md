I worry that we're changing `is_Foo()` to mean "does this object provide the interface defined by `abc.Foo`?" But then `abc.Foo` doesn't declare any methods, properties, or data.

On the other hand, you don't want to put the implementation into the base class, because the whole point is to avoid importing the implementations to perform a typecheck. Nor does it make much sense to blindly add a million ``@`abstractmethod def foo(...): pass` lines to each ABC. I guess in lieu of an alternative, it has to be OK.

I wonder if something ridiculous like this wouldn't also work as an interim hack:


```
sage: def is_Polyhedron(C):
....:     return "Polyhedron_base" in [c.__name__ for c in C.__class__.__mro__]
```


You can also check the (string) module name with `c.__module__` to avoid name clashes. But chances are, it's slower at runtime.

I don't know how to do it with a decorator, but I think a metaclass can ensure that a given class is only subclassed once. As an added bonus, the metaclass can explain why these exist and how they should be used (i.e. that they aren't really abstract base classes).

This example fails (as intended) the second time we subclass:


```python
class TypeCheckWrapper(type):
    _subclasses = 0

    def __init__(cls, name, bases, clsdict):
        if len(cls.mro()) > 2:
            TypeCheckWrapper._subclasses += 1
            if TypeCheckWrapper._subclasses > 1:
                raise TypeError("TypeCheckWrapper with multiple subclasses")
        super(TypeCheckWrapper, cls).__init__(name, bases, clsdict)

class Polyhedron(metaclass=TypeCheckWrapper):
    pass

print("Defined base class Polyhedron")

class Cone(Polyhedron):
    pass

print("Defined class Cone(Polyhedron)")

class Polytope(Polyhedron):
    pass

print("Defined class Polytope(Polyhedron)")
```
