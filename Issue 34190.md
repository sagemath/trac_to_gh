This looks great! I think this also solves the problem that tensor bundles currently return the preferred local frame of the tangent bundle.

Moreover, tensor powers and exterior powers of vector bundles should be easy to implement by following the same strategy as for tensor bundles. The only reason I haven't done it so far was exactly that those powers in the free module case had no bases.

However, perhaps it is a better idea to start with some sort of unifocation first, to avoid redundancies. Otherwise we have to write similar code twice (for tangent bundles and for vector bundles). After all, tangent bundles are just special cases of vector bundles. I am still not sure though what a good implemention strategy would be to achive that.

Speaking of which: what about fiber bundles?

Thanks for taking a look!

For exterior powers, I still hope to come back to the approach of #30242, making them quotients. This will basically come for free when #30229 is complete.

Right now I don't have an opinion on how this should be generalized to tensor/vector/fiber bundles
