CC:  @mezzarobba @slel @videlec @tscrim @umedoblock @embray

After #18036, the global `i` or `I` is defined as
a number field element rather than a symbolic constant.

Necessary adaptations throughout the code base were
made in #18036, as well as a deprecation in `src/sage/symbolic/all.py`, which should be updated
only after the usual one year deprecation period (starting
from the release of Sage 9.3).

Only a few more documentation bits need updating in:

- `src/doc/*/tutorial/tour_rings.pyx`
- `src/sage/rings/complex_mpfr.pyx`

as revealed by

```
git grep '``I``' src | grep ymbol
git grep '``I``' src/doc
```

Many places could also get the symbolic `I` directly
using `SR.I()` rather than converting with `SR(I)`.

In `sage.rings.complex_mpfr.is_ComplexNumber`, let us
keep an introductory sentence for the example showing
that `1 + 2*I` and `CC(1 + 2*I)` behave differently.

Let us also change the files `src/doc/*/tutorial/tour_rings.tst`
that used to mention the global `I` as symbolic.

The Japanese one at `src/doc/*/tutorial/tour_rings.tst`
still needs editing; the others need proofreading.

Oops, I just gave positive review to my own changes.

Can someone fluent in Japanese check how to make similar changes in

- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/doc/ja/tutorial/tour_rings.rst

as were done in

- https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=3d67f89925fdaf4482c12f9c06f23738a47d7db1

Ideally in this ticket. Otherwise in a follow-up ticket.
