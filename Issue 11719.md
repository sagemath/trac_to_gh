Mostly, PARI only works with number fields defined by monic integral polynomials.  A few functions (like `factornf()`) also work for non-monic polynomials.  In these cases, PARI always requires the polynomial to have integer coefficients.  So, PARI prefers `2*x^2 - 1` over `x^2 - 1/2` for defining a number field.  The `NumberField` method `pari_polynomial` should reflect this.

The code looks good, and passes tests, and it means we can at least compute discriminants. 

The first and second things I try still don't work though, and I'm curious what you think about this:

```
sage: k.<a, c> = NumberField([x^2 + 1/3, x^2 + 1/4])
sage: k
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1/3 over its base field
sage: a+c
  ***   Warning: non-monic polynomial. Result of the form [nf,c].
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
... 
BOOM!
sage: k.relative_discriminant()
  ***   Warning: non-monic polynomial. Result of the form [nf,c].
BOOM!
```



Side Remarks: 1. I've always intended to just rewrite number fields to completely use

```
sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.heegner.make_monic
```

behind the scenes, and do *everything* that involves PARI in all cases using a monic integral polynomial, and only convert to the user's representation for input and output.  I wish I had done that when I was first writing number fields. 


2. This is disturbing:

```
sage: K.<I> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: K.pari_polynomial()
x^2 + 1
sage: K.pari_polynomial('I')
0
```

I would rather get an error message in the latter case.  What do you think?  If you agree, could you open a ticket?


Anyway, I'll wait for your comments...

I never intended this ticket to completely fix non-integral/non-monic number fields.  I can have a look at the error messages above and try to fix them, but I also do not want to put too much effort.  The main motivation for this ticket was to support #11890, for which it seems to work.

Okay, that should be fixable (currently, we simply substitute instead of creating a polynomial with a given variable).

Looks ok to me.

fully tested in sage-4.7.1. The code and the tests seem fine. It does not allow to operate in towers of numberfields with nonintegral generators, but neither worked in previous Sage versions.

I have a question regarding pari_relative_polynomial in number_field_rel

The output of this method will be a monic polynomial. So we may have non-trivial denominators. Is this OK?

It's the only way.  There is no meaningful definition of the "denominator" of a polynomial over a number field.  So in order to get something canonical, let's take the monic polynomial.
