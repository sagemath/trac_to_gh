In #28444, bytes_to_str was made more tolerant: It now accepts as input not only bytes but also str. A str input is returned unaltered.

However, when a pickle is created in py3 and unpickled in py2, a py3-str would be unpickled as a py2-unicode, which means that bytes_to_str fails:

```
sage: from sage.cpython.string import bytes_to_str
sage: bytes_to_str(u'bla')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-342652ffe6fc> in <module>()
----> 1 bytes_to_str(u'bla')

     29 
     30

     55         return b
     56     if type(b) is not bytes:
---> 57         raise TypeError(f"expected bytes, {type(b).__name__} found")
     58 
     59     if PY_MAJOR_VERSION <= 2:

TypeError: expected bytes, unicode found
```

Obvious fix: Convert unicode to str.

That needs to go into a differently-named routine. You're clearly not converting bytes to str here. You're taking *some* input and trying to ensure it's "str".

There is of course a way to convert a unicode object to py2: `s.encode("utf8")`. Which in Py3 will actually result in a bytes object. That's a pretty clear clue that this behaviour does NOT belong in a routine named `bytes_to_str`.

Question: Is the change that I have introduced in #28444 OK, then? At least it made it possible to read a py2 pickle in py3.
