Keywords: manifolds, chart, coordinate_change

As pointed out in this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/AilDfydrnSI/XhO1EbALEQAJ), the keyword `verbose=True` used to trigger the check of the inverse of a transition map in `CoordChange.set_inverse()` would be better named `check=True`. This performed in this ticket. Moreover, `check=True` is now the default (previously, it was `verbose=False`) and the printed output of the check is improved.

I think you should also have a `verbose` option whose default is `False` so it doesn't print all the information with the check (as we should assume the check pass).

If we restore a `verbose` option, then there is no point in having `check=True` since the printed output is the only outcome of the check. In particular, no exception is raised if the check is failed. The appreciation of whether the check is passed or not is thus left to the user.

Taking into account the above, a possible use of a `verbose` option would the following: if `check=True`, then 
- for `verbose=True`, print the check details (as they are now)
- for `verbose=False`, print nothing if the check is fully passed (i.e. if the variable `any_failure` defined in the code remains to `False`) and print the check details (as they are now) when some failure has occurred

Would you agree with such a behavior?
