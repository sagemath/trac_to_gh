LGTM although if you want to while-we-are-at-it:

```diff
-            auts = [matrix(ZZ, 3, [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i]) for a in I for b in I for c in I for d in I for e in I for f in I for g in I for h in I for i in I]
+            import itertools
+            auts = [matrix(ZZ, 3, m) for m in itertools.product([I]*9)]
```


```diff
-            raise ValueError("Oops, only implemented for definite forms.")
+            raise NotImplementedError("only implemented for definite forms")
```

Maybe also more professional error messages in `sum_by_coefficients_with` too.

If you don't want to do any of these, feel free to ignore. You can set a positive review on my behalf after making any subset of these changes.
