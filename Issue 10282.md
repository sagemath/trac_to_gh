Applying [attachment:trac_10283.patch] to Sage 4.6.1.alpha1, building the HTML version of the reference manual results in the following warning:


```
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.6.1.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/crypto/mq/mpolynomialsystem.rst:: WARNING: citation not found: CB07
```


And building the PDF version results in the following warning:


```
resolving references...
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.6.1.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/index.rst:: WARNING: citation not found: CB07
```


The warning is fixed in [attachment:trac-10283_reviewer.patch], which needs reviewing.
