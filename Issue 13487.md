This ticket adds a function that just checks whether there exists a homomorphism from the given graph to another one.

Lots of unnecessary whitespace changes in graphs/generic_graph.py

Also, needs to be rebased for #12091 (which is in sage-5.5.rc0)

Oh... Right.. Sage-5-5.rc0 is when all my LP code breaks `:-/`

Hey, I just applied it on 5.5.rc0 and nothing bad happens. What do you think needs to be rebased ? `O_o`

Did you run doctests for `sage/graphs/graph.py`? They do fail on the patchbot.

ahahahah.

Yeah, of course... I saw that the first file modified was generic_graph (ony whitespaces, of course `:-P`) and all tests passed, of course.

Ok, so it backfired. I won't play with whitespaces anymore `:-P`

Ok, patch updated... But I don't get something : how come the error was 

```
      File "mip.pyx", line 2083, in sage.numerical.mip.Sum (sage/numerical/mip.c:10864)
      File "element.pyx", line 332, in sage.structure.element.Element.__getattr__ (sage/structure/element.c:3523)
      File "misc.pyx", line 204, in sage.structure.misc.getattr_from_other_class (sage/structure/misc.c:1509)
    AttributeError: 'sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearFunction' object has no attribute 'sum'
```

(hence it came from the Sum function, hence the function still exists in Sage and can be imported) while it cannot be used with the new variables ? Why does it still exist after all your patches to replace the LP's symbolics ? `O_o`

The capital-s `Sum` is still there, its just deprecated. Though there is a bug in it that apparently went unnoticed. I'll attach a patch.

This patch conflicts with #13784.  This one should be rebased.
