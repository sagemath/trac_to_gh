Giving opacity as a fraction breaks the save method.  No error is raised and no image is created.


```
plot3d(lambda x, y: x^2 + y^2, (-2,2), (-2,2),opacity=8/10).save('~/tmp.png')
```


This appears to be a problem with tachyon not handling fractions.  Here is another example with an error message (shown with the keyword `verbosity=2`):


```
sage: S = sphere(opacity=8/10, aspect_ratio=[1,1,1], verbosity='2')
sage: S.save('~/tmp.png')
```

Changing opacity to .8 in this example works as expected.
