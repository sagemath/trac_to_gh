Isn't the location of that thing `/Applications/Xcode_12_beta.app`?

It looks to me that you select `/Applications/Xcode_12.app`. Is this guaranteed to work?

On my machine, it's `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app`.

This contradicts https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.15-Readme.md#xcode, but I guess that is a "user" created page and maybe it is not up to date.

Yes, this page is outdated.

This is the path that currently works.
