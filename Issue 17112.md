Have you gone to a sage shell (`./sage -sh`) before running `ldd`? It looks suspiciously like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not set.

> Have you gone to a sage shell (`./sage -sh`) before running `ldd`? It looks suspiciously like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not set.

Oops, indeed, you're right. But this means that I can only build Sage on this system using Sage's gcc rather than the system gcc, as libopenmp comes from Sage, and it seems that gcc is the only Sage package it could come from...
(Otherwise R won't build without setting `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`)

Yes that must means that your system gcc has been deemed inadequate and sage has been built with its own gcc. Is this a problem?

Actually, it's all OK; the system gcc uses system's libopenmp, while Sage's gcc needs a newer version, coming from gcc's spkg. Sorry for barking up the wrong tree.
