`fgrep -R ' a inf' src/sage -R` founds two more, and 

`egrep ' a [aeiouy][a-z]{3,}' -R src/sage -o --no-filename | sort | uniq -c`

founds for example "a open" six times.

Shell is fun, so some more:


```
egrep ' an [aeiouy][a-z]{3,}' -R src/sage -o --no-filename | sort -u | colrm 1 4 > /tmp/an
egrep ' a [aeiouy][a-z]{3,}' -R src/sage -o --no-filename | sort -u | colrm 1 3 > /tmp/a
fgrep -x --file=/tmp/a /tmp/an
```


Some way to extract parts from docstrings and feed them to spell checker would be nice.
