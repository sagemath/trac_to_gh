Didn't want to wait several hours for 6.2.beta0 to compile. So, this is based off #15569 (with 6.1 merged on to that).

I don't understand why this should not merge cleanly. If you want me to base it off 6.1 directly, so that 6.1.1 can be released, then let me know.

Merges cleanly for me. `@`ppurka: don't do any additional merge please.
