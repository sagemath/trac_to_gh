I'm not sure I like the principle of using `TypeError`s to indicate that something doesn't have the right parent. But as far as I understand this is what the coercion code does, so why not. I'm wondering if in the long run we shouldn't introduce a `ParentError`, though.

Not a bad idea actually, especially since it sometimes makes sense to differentiate between `ParentError` and a `TypeError` for other reasons.
