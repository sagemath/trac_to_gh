If you could make these changes:

```diff
     def automorphisms(self):
         r"""
-        Return all Galois automorphisms of self.
+        Return all Galois automorphisms of ``self``.
 
         OUTPUT:
 
-            - a sequence containing just the identity morphism
+        - a sequence containing just the identity morphism
 
         EXAMPLES::
 
             sage: QQ.automorphisms()
             [
             Ring endomorphism of Rational Field
               Defn: 1 |--> 1
             ]
         """
-        return Sequence([self.hom(1, self)], cr=True, immutable=False,
-                check=False)
+        return Sequence([self.hom(1, self)], cr=True, immutable=False,
+                        check=False)
```

Once you've done that, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
