This example should show what's wrong. It claims a rank 4 module is equal to a rank 2 module.

```
sage: J = J0(22)
sage: E = J.endomorphism_ring()
sage: T = E.image_of_hecke_algebra()
sage: E.free_module()
Free module of degree 16 and rank 4 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1]
[ 0  1  0  0  2 -1  0  0  1 -1  1 -1  0  0  0 -2]
[ 0  0  1  0  1  0 -2  1  1  0 -1  0  1  1 -1 -1]
[ 0  0  0  1  1 -1  0  1  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0 -1]
sage: T.free_module()
Free module of degree 16 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1]
[ 0  0  1 -1  0  1 -2  0  0  1 -1  0  1  1 -1  0]
sage: T == E
True
```


The equality testing is calling equality testing as homsets which is not useful in this setting.

```
def __eq__(self, other):
    """
    For two homsets, it is tested whether the domain, the codomain and
    the category coincide.
    ...
    """
```


This ticket will change equality testing to equality as ZZ-modules. This ticket will also add a rank method which is the rank as a ZZ-module.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
