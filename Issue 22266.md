# Issue 22266: Fix treatment of symbolic derivatives in simplification of coordinate functions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2017-03-02 21:00:10

Keywords: manifolds, coordinate functions

This ticket fixes a bug that appeared in `src/sage/manifolds/utilities/simplify_sqrt_real` after the introduction of `diff(...)` instead of `D[...]` to denote derivatives of symbolic functions. This bug has been reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36777/covariant-derivative-gives-error-why-sage-751/ and the `diff(...)` issue is discussed at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/lZ4AjbmvvQE/4ZZddjLTBAAJ.
