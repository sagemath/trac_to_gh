For the sagenb problem, maybe we can just remove the `Miscellanous` part of the doc. but in another ticket.

The `__div__` problem is quite mysterious to me.

Should we accept this as is, perhaps without the change to `__div__` (since I don't think it helps)? It is certainly an improvement, even though it doesn't fix everything.

Regarding `__div__`, could it be a Cython problem, perhaps to do with inheritance? I ran into something similar a few days ago when I was playing with the `matrix` directory and Python 3. In the file `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`, in the class `Matrix_integer_dense`, there is a method `__nonzero__`, but when you define a matrix in this class, it doesn't have this method:

```
sage: a = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2, 3)(range(6))
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'>
sage: a.__nonzero__()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-9-74dab0bd3f82> in <module>()
----> 1 a.__nonzero__()

    [snip]

AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' object has no attribute '__nonzero__'
```
If I change the name of the method to anything else, e.g., `__nonzero2__`, then `a.__nonzero2__()` works.

In any case, the `__div__` problem may be complicated, so I would prefer to deal with it on a separate ticket.
