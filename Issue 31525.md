# Issue 31525: Limit of factorial crashes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31762

Original creator: @cEMRSS

Original creation time: 2021-05-01 23:18:02

The relatively simple limit `sage: ((factorial(x)-1)/x).limit(x=0)` crashes silently, regardless of the algorithm.

I don't think the situation is as bad as the description says, because only the `maxima` algorithm crashes for me (but the answer from `fricas` does not seem very useful):

```
sage: ((factorial(x) - 1)/x).limit(x=0, algorithm='maxima_taylor')
-euler_gamma

sage: ((factorial(x) - 1)/x).limit(x=0, algorithm='sympy')
-euler_gamma

sage: ((factorial(x) - 1)/x).limit(x=0, algorithm='fricas')
D[0](factorial)(0)
```

On the other hand, the situation also seems worse than the description says because there doesn't even need to be a denominator for `maxima` to crash:

```
sage: (factorial(x)).limit(x=0, algorithm='maxima') # this is ok
1

sage: (factorial(x) + 1).limit(x=0, algorithm='maxima') # this crashes

```

This seems to be a maxima bug, because command-line maxima also crashes:

```
(%i1) limit(factorial(x), x, 0);
1

(%i2) limit(factorial(x) + 1, x, 0);

This is now [maxima bug 3865](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3865/).

Changing keywords from "" to "maxima, limit".
