# Issue 10372: Manage subdivisions when augmenting matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10425

Patch will allow optional recording of a new matrix subdivision when augmenting two matrices.

What should happen with row subdivisions?  The solution here is to preserve them (if a subdivided matrix as a result is requested) if and only if the two matrices have equal row subdivisions.

After this is reviewed, I'll implement similar behavior for the `stack()` command.

This depends on #10424.

#10424 needed reworking and I've moved this code there.  Once that ticket is closed, I'll make sure this one gets banished.

## Release Manager

#10424 now has a positive review, so this can be marked obsolete whenever it is appropriate.
