This is part of #12426 which is meant to update the `configure` script to mark `gfortran` as "not to be installed". With this, a smooth upgrade to #12426 should be possible

I am really curious to see if it will solve the problem but it is true that there are issues with configure. It otherwise looks good to me.

#12426 is merged, so it seems to have worked.
