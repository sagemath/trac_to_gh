In the constructor `GF` of a finite field the first task of sage is to decompose the argument `q` as a prime power. Since most users enter their argument as `p^d` this is a very useless task. We propose a new syntax `GF((p, d))` (or `GF(p, d)`?) to construct a finite field.

Possibly, we could tweak the sage preparser to automatically transform `GF(p^d)` into `GF((p, d))`.

In addition to making `GF(q)` work when `q` is either of the following:

- `p^d` (already works)
- `(p, d)` (definitely wanted)

there was a suggestion at #31686 to also acceptÂ `Factorization([(p, d)])`.
