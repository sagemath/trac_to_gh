# Issue 14368: Shouldn't the attacking_pairs method live in Partitions, not in Tableaux?

I was scrolling through ``sage/combinat/tableau.py`` and found this method of the Tableau class:


```
    def attacking_pairs(self):
        """
        Returns a list of the attacking pairs of self. An pair of cells (c,
        d) is said to be attacking if one of the following conditions
        hold:

        1. c and d lie in the same row with c to the west of d

        2. c is in the row immediately to the south of d and c
           lies strictly east of d.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: t = Tableau([[1,2,3],[2,5]])
            sage: t.attacking_pairs()
            [((0, 0), (0, 1)),
             ((0, 0), (0, 2)),
             ((0, 1), (0, 2)),
             ((1, 0), (1, 1)),
             ((1, 1), (0, 0))]
        """
        attacking_pairs = []
        for i in range(len(self)):
            for j in range(len(self[i])):
                #c is in position (i,j)
                #Find the d that satisfy condition 1
                for k in range(j+1,len(self[i])):
                    attacking_pairs.append( ((i,j),(i,k)) )

                #Find the d that satisfy condition 2
                if i == 0:
                    continue
                for k in range(j):
                    attacking_pairs.append( ((i,j),(i-1,k)) )

        return attacking_pairs
```


I see nothing about this method that actually uses the entries of the tableau, as opposed to just its shape. As the method is never used (or at least ``grep "attacking_pairs" -r *`` doesn't find it anywhere outside its own definition), it shouldn't be hard to just move it, right?

I agree (somehow I had missed this e-mail). I'm cc-ing Chris Berg to see if he has an opinion on this.

Oops, I forgot about this ticket. Everything I wanted to do about this is done and merged already in #15327. Sorry for the misdirection.
