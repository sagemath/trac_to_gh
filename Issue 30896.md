**Tickets:**

- #29055: Installing any optional package on the binary distribution triggers full recompile of sagelib
- #31076: Make Sage relocatable
- #31131: linux distribution contains uncleaned build directories


**Testing of the sage binary distributions:**

- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution runs on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- A Dockerfile for testing that the sage binary distribution is able to install optional packages when run on `ubuntu:latest` with the following set of installed distribution packages....
- Test that a macOS binary distribution works on a set of OS versions, with and without XCode installed. (Sadly, cannot use Docker for that.)
- See the following for some work in this direction:
   - https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-coin (current)
   - https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage_binary_tester (outdated)
