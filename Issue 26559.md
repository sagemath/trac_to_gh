Here is code to test the memleaks:

```
def A(n):
    from sage.graphs.independent_sets import IndependentSets
    G = Graph(2)
    for i in range(n):
        x = [0] in IndependentSets(G)
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print get_memory_usage()

def B(n):
    from sage.graphs.independent_sets import IndependentSets
    G = Graph(2)
    for i in range(n):
        x = next(iter(IndependentSets(G)))
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print get_memory_usage()
```

I can take a look, but compiling will take time; others can check this too.

Confirmed, this blocks the memory leak. Thanks.
