Keywords: elliptic curve period lattice

Possibly missed by #28057.   The method `omega()` for elliptic curve period lattices has a precision parameter `prec` which is correctly passed on to the function `real_period()` for real embeddings, but not to the function `complex_area()` for complex emneddings.

A one-line fix is needed (line 914 of period_lattice.py) which I will do and add a doctest.

Before:

```
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[1,2,3,4,5])
sage: embs = K.embeddings(CC)
sage: L = E.period_lattice(embs[0])
sage: L.omega()
2.97191526781791
sage: L.omega(prec=100)
2.97191526781791
```

and after:

```
sage: L.omega()
2.97191526781791
sage: L.omega(prec=100)
2.9719152678179096707716479509
