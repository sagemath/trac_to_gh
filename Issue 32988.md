Keywords: lazy, charts

As discussed in #31249, a lazy implementation of charts or transition maps comes in handy in some situations as the number of transition maps explodes very easily.

In this ticket, we introduce a lazy implementation of transition maps that only initializes most attributes, especially the associated `MultiCoordFunction` and the inverse, if necessary.

We could try to speed up initialization by using [__slots__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots). In my opinion, this is something we should use more frequently in `manifolds` anyway.

This seems like a good partial measure to do and is much smaller in scope than broad lazy objects. I also support the more targeted focus on the most computationally intensive part.

I would worry about doing `__slots__` on a later ticket unless it is both easy and simple to do for this.

It shouldn't be very difficult. Actually it's quite straightforward. You only add a `__slots__` attribute. Done. Keep in mind that the corresponding class has no `__dict__` attribute then.

Two basic implementation ideas would be you either use an ``@`lazy_attribute` decorator for the relevant attribute(s) or you set it to `None` on `__init__` and compute it when called for.

Thanks so much!

Thinking about the original motivation for this, the Grassmannian, the problem we are looking to solve is the large overhead created by the creation of many charts. Looking at each individual chart and transition map it doesn't appear to me to have too much overhead. Are we looking to create something that is more of a "lazy atlas" or is a lazy transition map really what we want?

I don't know for sure. My suggestion is to make a prun test on high-dimensional projective spaces and see what the culprits are.

Notice that one transition map is always accompanied by a `MultiCoordFunction` object, and another transition map, namely its inverse, again with a `MultiCoordFunction` object. However, there is no need to initialize the inverse on the fly when the formulas are known. My hope is that this leads to some speed-up.

Implementing `__slots__` for charts might also help a little (speeds up initialization and access).

This is done already for spheres, cf. line 1029 of `sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/sphere.py`:
