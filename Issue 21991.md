CC:  @jdemeyer @vbraun

On Mac, the `install_name_tool` used in `lcalc`'s `spkg-install` sometimes fails when directory names are longer than usual.

```
lcalc-1.23.p14] error: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone for: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/another-local-sans-autotools/lib/libLfunction.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)
```

No error is signaled (due to a bug in `spkg-install`); but as a result, `libLfunction.dylib` cannot be loaded. This can lead to errors in the docbuild:

```

```


(As usual, the whole problem is caused by someone's hand-written Makefiles.)
Really, someone should autotoolize the package instead.

This is likely to show up in users' builds once configuring SAGE_LOCAL (#21479) becomes popular. 
Needs review.

Is it the total length of the path, or the length of some component of the path, that triggers this? I would like to reproduce the bug.

I believe it is the discrepancy of a path when the compiler/linker is invoked to the one that `install_name_tool` is supposed to put.
It may be necessary to use a custom SAGE_LOCAL.

So I can't test this unless I use #21479? To use #21479, I need to do something like run `autoconf` to create the new `configure` script, right? How exactly do I do that? If I just run `autoconf` (version 2.69), I get error messages:

```
configure.ac:42: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
configure.ac:45: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_MAINTAINER_MODE
configure.ac:61: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PACKAGE_NAME
configure.ac:71: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR
```

So I must be doing something wrong. Not surprising, since I don't know autoconf and its relatives.

Never mind, I guess it was `autoreconf` that I need to run. That seems to have worked.

I can reproduce the problem on one machine but not on another; I wonder if depends which version of Xcode is installed.
