The first one seems to indicate that the meaning of "..." has changed: it fails because the next line is interpreted as part of the doctest instead of part of the output.

The other failures are a consequence of the first.

Replying to [comment:7 slabbe]:
> oups, the plugins "doctest continuation" seems unhappy. And sometimes `pyflakes` too.

I do not understand this.  It is complaining about the doctest which I just changed:

```
    sage: r = findstat(Permutations, lambda pi: pi.saliances()[0]); r           # optional -- internet
    0: ...
    ... (St000051: The size of the left subtree of a binary tree., [Mp00069: complement, Mp00061: to increasing tree], 1000)
    ...
    sage: (s, list_f, quality) = next((a,b,c) for a,b,c in r if a.id() == 51)   # optional -- internet
```

I can't see what's wrong with it - any ideas?

Concerning `StandardError`, it seems that this should be replaced with `Exception`.
