Argh: your comment made me realize that integers already had a `squarefree_part()` method that uses a different definition of the squarefree part.

Good to notice that in this time and not later...

Can you also check #20369, if there will be something similar problem?

I found no mention of `elementary_divisor()` anywhere in the sage source code, so I guess there won't be the same problem. Of course, there could always be another inconsistency regarding who knows what convention or definitions, like there are so many in sage!

Thanks for the suggestion. I moved the implementation using `factor()` to my new method.
