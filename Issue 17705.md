In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file and not just let it linger on the remote server.

I'm proposing to do this by returning, from `save()`, a `SavedFile` object instead of nothing. The `SavedFile._rich_repr_` method then returns a custom rich representation which gives browser-based display backends a hook to do something with the saved file. Also, nothing happens if you call save() from within code---only if it hits the displayhook:

```
sage: my_plot.save()        # yes, download
sage: _ = my_plot.save()    # no automatic download
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # depends
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     my_plot.save()    # no
....:     x = x + i
```

> In a browser-based notebook an object's `save()` method should automatically download the saved file

I'm not sure that I agree with this. You might want to `save()` the object on the server to `load()` it in some Sage session later.

If you want download functionality, I would prefer to use a new `.download()` method for that.

Just to clarify, save() should of course still save the file on the remote file system. It just should **in addition** get the file to the client.

Tying it to the displayhook already gives you a means to control whether or not the file is downloaded. Also, if you really just save a temporary file on the server you are more likely to do that form within code so it wouldn't be downloaded anyway. There could be other switches, maybe `foo.save(download=False)` or `%download [on|off]`. But just `foo.save()` should by default do something sensible. If you don't like the default you can then look into the docs. But if you only notice that `save()` doesn't result in a file on your laptop then the user is going to assume that this is the way it is.

From a user these are two different activities:
* checkpointing the current worksheet

* creating a media file to be used elsewhere
I agree that its confusing that both are called "save", and it all goes back to the time when Word would crash every 30 minutes so you better save your document to three different floppies.
