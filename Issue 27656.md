While porting some code from `sage.libs.ppl` to `pplpy`, I encountered the following.

```
sage: K.<f> = QQ[]
sage: 1.__mpz__() * f
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: There is a BUG in the coercion model:
                Action found for R <built-in function mul> S does not have the correct domains
                R = Set of Python objects of class 'mpz'
                S = Univariate Polynomial Ring in f over Rational Field
                (should be Integer Ring, Univariate Polynomial Ring in f over Rational Field)
                action = Left scalar multiplication by Integer Ring on Univariate Polynomial Ring in f over Rational Field (<type 'sage.categories.action.PrecomposedAction'>)
```
