# Issue 14598: improve dynamic attributes of symbolic expressions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14802

Original creator: burcin

Original creation time: 2013-06-21 22:20:25

Keywords: sd48

Symbolic functions can define dynamic attributes that will be added to symbolic expressions representing evaluated forms of these functions (#9556).

This patch extends the existing functionality to allow these attributes to take arbitrary arguments. It also passes the function class and the symbolic expression as arguments.

I'm getting doctest failures:

```
sage -t sage/symbolic/function_factory.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t sage/symbolic/expression.pyx  # 3 doctests failed
```

Missing dependency?

I forgot to update the documentation after adding the new function class argument. Updated patch attached.

Tabs are not allowed, can you convert it to spaces?

```
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx  # Tab character found
```
