Ca devrait, mais si ca te rassure je peux faire un rebasage dessus.

bah, ca a l'air bien disjoint

Pas exactement relié au ticket mais on peut déjà créer des valeurs divergentes

```
sage: M = Multizetas(QQ)
sage: M.monomial(W([1]))
ζ(1)
```

I think "depth filtration" is an usual terminologie, not "length filtration".

According to Waldschmidt "Lectures on Multiple Zeta Values" both *length* and *depth* are used. And he clearly prefers length.

But I can do whatever you prefer.

ok, comme tu voudras.

Autre remarque: 

```
+        if index[-1] == 1:
+            raise ValueError("divergent zeta value")
         if reverse:
             index = list(reversed(index))
```

ici, il faudrait tenir compte de la presence eventuelle de l'option reverse.
