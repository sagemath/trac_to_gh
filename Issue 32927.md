CC:  @defeo @JohnCremona

This was discovered while digging for the underlying reason behind #33156:


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a3')
sage: R.<X> = QQ[]
sage: S.<Y> = R.quotient(X^2)
sage: E.division_polynomial(5, x=Y)
-5*Y
sage: E.division_polynomial(5, x=X)
-5*Y
```


To fix it, we should probably include `x.parent()` in the cache key.

As I mentioned on #33165, `is_gen()` is not a catchall for things constructed more generally. So a more comprehensive test should be done if that fails for `polynomial_is_variable()`.

For the caching in the `x is not None` case, it might be better to have an option to compute in the generic cache and then specialize the parameter (say, you are using just a monomial input). This could be useful to reduce the cache size and possibly use already cached results (including if you vary the input). I don't think this will add a lot of complexity to the code, but it gives the user more control over the cache and computation.

Doesn't commit `ad9a380b80` (added after you pointed out the issue in #33165) take care of this?

So, if I understand this correctly, you'd like a keyword argument to override the (existing) `evaluate` flag?

Yes, sorry, I missed that commit.

Thank you. One last little detail. In `division_polynomial()`, have the docstring bullet points have the indentation as

```
- ``arg`` -- short description

  A long description in a separate paragraph.

- ``more`` -- another argument

  Another long description paragraph.
```

Right now, your subsequent paragraphs are also indented, which may not be the desired effect.

Also one pyflakes thing:

```

Here's two more optional things:

Actually, it might make sense to `cpdef bint polynomial_is_variable()` with a (top-level) `cimport MPolynomial` (you don't need to worry about cyclic imports since it has a header file). Although this is a definite micro-optimization that might not be so useful.

I might also change this

```diff

-                or (x.degree() == 1 and x[0].is_zero() and x[1].is_one())

+                or (x.degree() == 1 and x[0].is_zero() and x[1].is_one()))
