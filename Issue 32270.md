Possibly some of them are needed to break circular imports, but likely not all of them.

Part of #32501.

In `src/sage/combinat/__init__.py`, there is 

```
from . import quickref
from . import tutorial
```

These are modules without code. Are these imports needed for anything?

I am guessing these are some kind of workarounds for the sphinx docbuild?
We can take care of them in #32508.

looks good, but does it pass the doctests with `optional - dot2tex` ?
