CC:  @dkrenn skropf

Keywords: finite_state_machine

Current inconsistent behaviour:

```
sage: T = Transducer()
sage: T.default_format_transition_label([])
'\\varepsilon'
sage: T.default_format_transition_label(iter([]))
''
sage: T.format_transition_label_reversed([])
''
```


Change code such that `\varepsilon` is returned in all three instances.
