Deprecate the print option `generator_cmp` in favour of `generator_key` and `generator_reverse`.

This is part of #16536.

Hello,

1. Could you motivate a bit more this change. I do not find simpler to use a `key` function instead of a `cmp` function.

2. It does not apply on the most recent version of Sage.

3. I found the docstring confusing

```
def indices_key(self):
    r""""
    A comparison function on sets which gives a linear extension
    of the inclusion order
```

   This is *not* a comparison function (which would have pairs as input)!

More to come, when you answer 1

Vincent

In Python 3 the `cmp` keyword has been removed in favor of `key` and `reverse` arguments. To reduce the overhead for a user to provide `cmp` and `key` function (e.g. one for sage's `print_options()` and the other for python's `sort()`) I suggest to harmonize the parameters.

I just went through the diff, and it sounds reasonable (haven't checked the details though).

Do we want to use the occasion to find better names for the options? `generator_key` and `generator_reverse` can be confusing (e.g. in an algebra one may think that this is about the algebra generators; also one may believe that this is about recovering the index of a generator in its family). Given that the sorting function is called `sorted_items` in `CombinatorialFreeModule` and `IndexedFreeMonoid`, I would lean toward something like `sort_key` and `sort_reverse`.

Tiny detail:
- in `filtered_algebras_with_basis.py`, sort_key would better be a method, with doctest, as in `orlik_solomon.py`

After a discussion with Nicolas, we decided to use `sorting_key` and `sorting_reverse` to avoid any potential ambiguity.

There should be a comma or a dot somewhere in the sentence

```
Option monomial_cmp is deprecated use sorting_key and sorting_reverse instead.
```

ok, looks almost good to me. 

in the example

```
sorted(A.indices(), key=cmp_to_key(A.indices_cmp))
```

one should use instead the new `indices_key`

Maybe also we should avoid using `cmp_to_key` as much as possible.

I decided to deprecate that function since it will be going away. However, because of how module morphism currently works, I had to write a small lambda function (which will vanish once we change this behavior in `module_morphism`).
