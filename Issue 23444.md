Issue created by migration from Trac.

I am solving LP problems where I only care about feasibility and would prefer to see

```
Linear Program  ( no objective, 128 variables, 632 constraints )
```

instead of

```
Mixed Integer Program  ( maximization, 128 variables, 632 constraints )
```

I just realized that a constant objective function is essentially the same as a zero objective function. So it should also be special-cased. Please review the last commit.

Either way is fine with me.
