Listing the optional packages for sage-4.7.alpha5 one sees:


```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha5$ ./sage -optional
Using SAGE Server http://www.sagemath.org//packages
http://www.sagemath.org//packages/optional/list --> /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.7.alpha5/tmp/list

glpk-4.42.p0
gmpy-1.0.1
...
```


Note '`glpk-4.42.p0`' is an optional package, yet a later version is a standard package:


```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha5$ ls spkg/standard/glpk*
spkg/standard/glpk-4.44.spkg
```


This has been so for several months - perhaps even a year. 

The optional package needs to be removed. I assume the changes will need to be made on the sage.math server and not in the source code of Sage, though I don't know for sure.

I recall someone saying that this is needed to support older versions of Sage, from the times it still was an optional package.

It may have been me ! If you have a *very* old version of Sage, and want to use GLPK, the new package wouldn't do..

... though it has really been a long time, and I think those who are using such an old version of GLPK will be glad to notice that if they have to upgrade their Sage to make it work, it will come with a lot of new useful stuff `:-)`

I would have thought if someone had such an old version of Sage they would either have installed the optional package by now, or will never install it. It was made a standard package in about June 2010. 

I can't see any point in keeping this. There is more chance of someone corrupting their recent Sage installation by installing this, than there is by someone with an old version of Sage wanting to add GLPK now.

+1 to removing the package ! Though if I make no mistake, installing the old one will have absolutely no effect.. But that's a very old code by now `:-)`

just recently, someone (Victor Miller?) complained on sage-devel that installing the optional old GLPK over the new one (he didn't notice that it's a standard package) gave him a non-working Sage.

OK, I give it a positive review.
