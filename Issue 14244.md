Keywords: mpfr, float

The `.sign_mantissa_exponent()` methods of the `RealNumber` and `RealDoubleElement` classes give a negative mantissa when the number is negative, which does not corresponds to the behaviour described in the documentation : 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_mpfr.html
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_double.html

We propose here to fix it. 

By the way, the variable `mantissa` sometimes (always?) appears in the source with the meaning of a signed mantissa. I would suggest to renamed it `signed_mantissa` or `s_mantissa` to ease code reading (though i do not feel able to detect which one is signed or not along the code). See for example the `.exact_rational()` method in `real_mpfr.pyx`.

I'm guessing this is ready for review?

Looks good, but one small thing, could you change line 2930 in `real_mpfr.pyx` to:

```
The mantissa is always a nonnegative number (see :trac:`14448`)::
```

or something to this extent, noting the problem was fixed in this ticket?

Thanks,

Travis
