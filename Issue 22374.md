CC:  @hivert @nthiery

The method `_sage_doc_` is used to have custom documentation for instances of a class. Such a use case makes sense, but it should be implemented as the `__doc__` attribute instead of the Sage-specific `_sage_doc_`.

This is easy for Python classes, but it might be problematic for `cdef class`es.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22611

What happens if `_instancedoc_` is not defined?  Will Cython make sure an `AttributeError` is raised in this case?

I think at the very least there should be a clear error message that `_instancedoc_` must be defined (including on base classes that may not have a sensible `_instancedoc_`, in which case it might be good if the descriptor also handled `NotImplemented` errors).

Right.  For example, in classes with the `ABCMeta` metaclass, if there are any unimplemented `abstractproperty` or `abstractmethod`, trying to instantiate the class results in:


```
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class A with abstract methods foo
```


This is a slightly different case of course, since it's an error that would occur at class definition time.  I was just using this as an example of a clearer error message.
