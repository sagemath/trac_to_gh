Following a request to test the following 3 lines of code on #8433


```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
}}} 

I did this on Sage 4.5.1 running on Solaris 10 and found no problems of excessive CPU time as reported at #8433. However, the quality of the output leaves a lot to be desired, and appears to show discontinuities which are not in the function. 

Attached are two images showing the output from Sage using the above commands, and Mathematica 7.0 using the following command

{{{
Plot3D[Sqrt[Sin[x] Sin[y]],{x,-2 Pi, 2 Pi},{y, - 2 Pi, 2 Pi}] 
}}}

It would be good if we could improve this.

I made the topic of the ticket much more descriptive of the problem pointed out.  If you'd like to open another ticket for another specific issue, feel free!

That's fine by me.

Changing keywords from "" to "plot3d".
