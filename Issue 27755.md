Added the optional parameter check_primes to sanity check that prime_list contains primes.

The following code fails because 0 is not prime.


```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f = DynamicalSystem([2*x^2 , y^2])
f.minimal_model(prime_list=[0])
```


A more descriptive error message was added.

Two quick comments here


```
if prime_list != None and check_primes:
```

should use

```
if (not prime_list is None) and check_primes:
```

and

```
is_prime(prime)
```

should be

```
prime.is_prime()
```

I'd also suggest not using special words like 'prime' for your variable name.
