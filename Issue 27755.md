# Issue 27755: sanity check parameter added to prime_list in minimal_model

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27992

Original creator: @blumt

Original creation time: 2019-06-14 14:15:04

CC:  @jasminecamero @loops7

Keywords: SI2019

Added the optional parameter check_primes to sanity check that prime_list contains primes.

The following code fails because 0 is not prime.


```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
f = DynamicalSystem([2*x^2 , y^2])
f.minimal_model(prime_list=[0])
```


A more descriptive error message was added.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Two quick comments here


```
if prime_list != None and check_primes:
```

should use

```
if (not prime_list is None) and check_primes:
```

and

```
is_prime(prime)
```

should be

```
prime.is_prime()
```

I'd also suggest not using special words like 'prime' for your variable name.
