In graphics.py, a bit of refactoring could be done by creating a common parent for Graphics and GraphicsArray (maybe something like GraphicsBase)

If #27865 solved this, set the ticket's milestone
to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix, so we can close.

Otherwise, it would be good to assess more precisely
what is left to do here.
