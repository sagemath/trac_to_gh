Aren't we GAP 4.8-based here, and waiting for it to be released?

Is the caching of keywords, etc done in sync with the updates of stored GAP workspaces?
(this is how it looks from reading the code, but perhaps I am missing something)

And what does happen if a GAP package is loaded? (e.g. `Graph` would only be available
after `LoadPackage("grape")`)

I think it is quite convoluted solution, also making it hard to hook up docs of GAP packages. 

Namely, the documentation does not magically change once a workspace is updated, but only when libGAP and GAP packages/databases are (re)installed. I'd rather see the corresponding cache built at libGAP (and eventually at GAP packages/GAP database) installation time, and not updated at runtime. This would not be a big rewrite, basically all the functionality for this is already implemented. 

I don't have a clear idea how to handle loadable packages, this can be postponed for another ticket.
