Could be also `is_decomposable`, don't know if that would be better.

Two little doc things:

```
:meth:`~FinitePoset.is_prime` | Return ``True`` if the poset can be written as a lexicographic sum of other posets.
```
Shouldn't this be `cannot be written`?

`untrivial` -> `non trivial`.

Otherwise LGTM, and you can set this to a positive review on my behalf once fixed.

Good point. The function was `is_decomposable` at first.

Marked as positive review. Thanks.
