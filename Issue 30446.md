# Issue 30446: Nu Tamari

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30683

In [https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3787](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3787) the authors define a new generalization to the Tamari lattice which they name the `\nu`-Tamari lattice. These are paths which are weakly above a (fixed given) path (named `\nu`). This ticket aims to add Nu Dyck Words (paths weakly above a given path) in addition to the Nu Tamari Lattice.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to incorporate Dyck words and the generalized Tamari lattice into this or not, so for now I haven't and wanted to get others' opinions before doing that. In addition, that could be a separate ticket potentially as a "future" goal.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I refreshed the branch on top of the latest develop. Still a lot of missing doctests.

For the iterator, I would suggest just to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` with nu as seed
and the neighbor function just exchanging 1 and 0 where possible.

Also the first line of doc shoud use imperative mode, so Return and Check with no s.

I have made a few more changes, using an iterator for the letter-swapping function.

patchbot is morally green, so we can set to positive if you agree
