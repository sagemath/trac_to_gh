Assignee: tbd

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: enumaration, integer, list, permutation, group

The goal is to enumerate lists up to the action of a Permutation Group. The final function is generate_list_of_sum(integer) which give all list which sum over all element is the integer.

The module in patch use the orderly generating algorithm. The goal is to select list which are maximals according the lexicographic order.

There is a lot of test on this module( strong_generating_system() are also test indirectly in this module... )

depends on #6647

Refactoring : 
-> I move the code in sage/combinat/invariant_ring_perm_gps (advise form Nicolas ThiÃ©ry)

There is no a shortcut in sage to IntegerVectorsUptoPermGroup which is a user friendly parent (with hope).

Hi!

This is not a review yet, just some remarks.

Indeed it seems to me that the comments and the documentation should be proof read by a native speaker. I am not a native speaker, I'm afraid.

I also suggest to rename some methods. For example, the purpose of "generate_list_of_sum" is not clear from that name:

* "generate" suggests a process. Therefore, I expected that the method would return an iterator. But in fact, an actual list is returned. A similar statement applies to "get_orbit". Why not simply "orbit"?
* "list_of_sums" is not clear at all. I mean, there is the notion of "partition", so, there is no reason to describe it as "list of sums". Of course, not all partitions are returned, but representatives for each permutation class of partitions.

So, I think "partition_class_representatives" or slightly less precise "partition_classes" would be clearer.

And "generate_canonicals": The return value is the list of canonical representatives of all children of the input. So, why not "children_representatives" or "canonical_children"?

Best regards, Simon

Feel free to point language mistakes to me! I have to improve my English. Use classical e-mail if you don't want to charge the trac.

Thanks very much, the code will be as much better as it will be used.

For this last upload :

I feel that my code is not very well polished, but I need advises, corrections and comments. Especially, I hope my English is not too much horrible. Flyspell is well configured on my emacs to american but I don't always use the right words. Sorry for that.

Any reason why you don't just use the tests but with this?

```
sage: long_test() # long time
```

It's too much work to remove all the #s anyway if one wanted to try them out.

I like the splitting things into pyx and not.  Also, any reason not to incorporate the pyx file into the documentation?

Thanks a lot for having regarded this...

For # long time, I do not know. I think I will select a subpart of the tests and include them with long time. The developer guide say : "These will not be run regularly during Sage development, but will get run before major releases. No example should take more than about 30 seconds.". Currently, on my three years old macbook, all tests take something like 6 minutes. Especially, there are also # optional - gap_database tests here. I will select some groups and add some tests with long time.

I didn't know we can add pyx file in the doctree, I will add it. I will also add comments on the fact that the is_canonical test is polymorph. I just checked the only thing required is a comparison test:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup import is_canonical
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4,5,6)]])
sage: sgs = [map(lambda x: Permutation(x), trans) for trans in G.strong_generating_system()]
sage: is_canonical(sgs, ['c','b','a','b','b','a'])
True
sage: is_canonical(sgs, [3,2,1,2,2,1])
True
```

As string can be compared with `<` and `>`, the function can be also used on such object.

I think that examples in cdef functions aren't required just because one cannot import them in the sage console. Try from file.pyx import <tab>. There is perhaps another way to import them, but I don't know...

For the behavior of list(), I think it is ok. The category framework do the job:

```
sage: I = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]]))
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = IntegerRange(1,+Infinity, 5)
sage: I
{1, 6, ..}
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: I
An example of an infinite enumerated set: the non negative integers
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
```


I going to improve the doc of IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup. You're definitely right and I think it deserves to stay the only entrance point for this module.

Thanks for your comments.

For the record: I finally re-implemented my algorithm for the computation of fundamental invariants of non-modular invariant rings of finite groups for the special case of permutation groups, using your implementation of orbits. I should have done that earlier. After all, thanks to your work on enumerating orbits, it will probably be a lot faster than my original implementation in Singular (which dealt very inefficiently with orbits).

Ok, here is a last version :

- Including categories of quotient of set and (In)finite enumerated set
- Using the cython data structure based on C array
- Tests of coherences with others features from combinat (Partition, monomials, graphs)
- Handling of 0-1 enumeration (like adjacent matrix of graph)

On this last Patch, all tests pass with --long and --optional for the two new files. I didn't run all tests of Sage but this new feature is orthogonal with other part of Sage. The docbuild produce no warning and the doc looks clean.

To present one other test, here is the way to build all unlabeled graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)
sage: G.cardinality() == factorial(7)
True
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
```

This module, not optimized for the graphs do that in less than 1 minutes on my 4 years old macbook. As improvement for the future, the code is trivially "parallelizable". But this parallelization should be done on SearchForest and not on this module.

For the reviewer, please be careful with my English. I still try to correct myself as much but I am sure some sentences are not full-sense and there are probably some mistakes that flyspell (and me) didn't catch.

There should not only be a fast `ClonableIntArray.list()`, but also a fast
`ClonableIntArray.tuple()`: Sometimes, one needs a tuple, not a list, and it
would be awkward and slow to first transfrom the clonable int array into a list
and transform that into a tuple.

I think that could be done here, or do you prefer a different ticket?

You know that my application of your work would be: Compute non-modular
invariant rings of permutation groups. For that purpose, it would be good if
clonable int arrays could be used to define exponent vectors of a monomial. But
that should clearly be on a different ticket.

What still needs review here?  Any English help still needed?

A couple points on the built doc:
* Some inconsistency in formatting, e.g. 

```
If sum is an integer, it returns a finite enumerated set containing all integer vectors maximum in their orbit for the lexicographic order and whose entries sum to `sum`.
```

  should pick `sum` or sum, preferably `sum`, I guess?
* Similarly, sometimes there are no links, as in 

```
To get the orbit of any integer vector  under the action of the group, use the method orbit:
```

  but others are indeed hyperlinked.  Might as well get it all done for ease of browsing.
* `last corner case :` should be `last corner case:`
* There are lots of missing periods at ends of sentences.  That is, at the ends of sentences which are not ended by colons, which is fine.

Sorry, I really should have focused on reviewing. Instead, I tried to use the patch in order to provide a better implementation of my algorithm on computing fundamental invariants of non-modular representations of finite groups, in the case of permutation groups.

Yes, the patch basically works (as confirmed by the patch bot). However, I will do some checks: My impression is that the combinat people tend to keep the most recent patch versions in the combinat queue, rather than posting them on trac.

In the function lex_cmp_partial, I see that the `__getitem__` method of clonable int arrays is called repeatedly. Calling `__getitem__` means: It is tested whether the argument is an integer or a slice, and whether the integer is non-negative and smaller than the length of the array.

I would think that lex_cmp_partial is called very often and is thus time critical, isn't it? Then, one should be a bit more direct: One should test saneness of the argument "`step`" only once, and should then directly access `v1._list[i]` and `v2._list[i]`. After all, v1 and v2 already are cdefined.

I suppose the corresponding change will be part of my reviewer patch, but I'd appreciate if Nicolas would send me a couple of examples, so that I can see whether there is a speed-up.

Still in lex_cmp_partial: If the two list segments are equal, then each pair of items is compared twice, namely:

```
    for i in range(step):

        else:
            return 1
    return 0

then only 11 or 12 comparisons are needed.

When I see

```
            for child in children:
                if child not in new_to_analyse:
                    new_to_analyse.append(child)
```

in the cpdef function "orbit" in sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup.pyx, it seems to me that new_to_analyse should rather be a set, not a list, since the containment test "child not in new_to_analyse" works a *lot* faster on (long) sets than lists.

Create a relatively large set of random ints, and get the corresponding list (unsorted, apparently):

```
sage: S = set(randint(1,20000) for _ in range(5000))
sage: L = list(S)
sage: L[:10]
[16384, 5019, 16203, 8195, 16388, 8197, 16391, 600, 16394, 8204]
```

Now, define one function operating on lists and another operating on sets that add the integers from 0 to 10000 to the list or set - but only if it isn't in the list/set yet.

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test1(list L):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         if i not in L:
....:             L.append(i)
....: def test2(set S):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         S.add(i)
....: """)
sage: len(L)
4426
sage: %time test1(L)
CPU times: user 2.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.12 s
Wall time: 2.12 s
sage: len(L)
12240
```

The operation on the set is so much faster that I'm measuring it with timeit, also taking the time to copy the set (so that the length is preserved when running the loop for the timing):

```
sage: len(S)
4426
sage: %timeit test2(copy(S))
625 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ms per loop
sage: len(S)
4426
```


Hence, the same operation (at least in my proof-of-concept) is roughly 2000 times faster on sets than on lists.

The disadvantage is that the output of orbit() would be in a random order, so that to the very least it has to be sorted in the doc tests. Do you want that the output of orbit() is a sorted list (which would of course be easy to implement)?

I just added two files providing a good k-test (especially for invariant theory):

The function to use is: TEST_generation_orbit_sum
The function is in the file: benchmarks_generating_orbit_sum.py

The good tests to run are the following (depending the size you want to test):
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(8,1), verbose=True) (~2 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(9,1), verbose=True) (~20 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(10,1), verbose=True) (~3 min)

All the complexity are contained in such examples.

For graphs lovers and the change from list to set, you should use a test including vector with large automorphism group like :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(15,28)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: timeit('S._cardinality_from_iterator()')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.3 s per loop
```

This test build the 156 graphs over 6 vertices enumerated up to an isomorphism. And vectors whose entries are 0 or 1 have 'often' large automorphism group.

Comparing the old implementation with Python list (and 2 years of development of Sage), the module is currently 3 or 4 times faster.

OK. What I had a few minutes ago was: Compute with sets internally and return an ordered list. But if you agree that a set is nicer then I can change it (means: Change the doc tests and the specification of the output).

There are two problems with the orbit() method:

```
        assert isinstance(v, (list, ClonableIntArray)), '%s shoud be a Python list or an element of %s'%(v, self)
        try:
            if v.parent() is self:

        except:
            return orbit(self._sgs, self.element_class(self, v, check=False))
```

That means that *None* is returned if v happens to be a ClonableIntArray with a different parent. Shouldn't v be transformed into an element of `self` instead?

And is it really a good idea to convert v into an element of `self` without checking?

Yes, this piece of code is horribly ugly... The point is that the orbit method will work with any integer vector. v doesn't need to be canonical. I don't have a use case but I was thinking it would be more convenient to allow the user to use this method for any integer vector (canonical or not). 

After for safety, I don't know the consequence of such a choice on the lung run.

Anyway, the test is_canonical should be very very much faster than the full expansion of an orbit and a user who want just an orbit can also compute his own function.

Agreed. So, check=False should be fine.

But I do think that the orbit method should try to convert the input vector from a different parent into self, and should certainly not return "None".

Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.

By the way, I made some further tweaks and am now down to

Yes! None is not an option here. It must return a set or raise an error.

> Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.

And more than that, there is a king of gardener lemma inside the is_canonical method, the partial_lex comparison cut some branches of the orbit just by reading the first entries.

I also think the change from list to set produce more than x2 speedup, it is probably an exponential optimization, you should try before and after with graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: time S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
Time: CPU 128.64 s, Wall: 136.10 s
```

It become to be a large test for this last one. (1044 symmetric matrices of size 7)

A student of Florent Hivert had to master project to parallelize SearchForest. Imagine what such module can need by inheritance... (with possible adaptations according changes of SearchForest)

I hesitate to directly give it a positive review, since I somehow think that my patch is not just a reviewer patch (in spite of its name), because it changes the code non-trivially. So, please have a closer look on it!

I posted an additional reviewer patch. Namely, in my first patch, I forgot to add a doctest (shame on me), and consequently the code contained a bug: Integer vectores `[1,2,3,1]` and `[1,2,3]` would have compared equal. That' fixed and tested with the second reviewer patch.

For the record: I give a positive review to Nicolas' patch. My first reviewer patch needs review, I believe. The second patch is trivial enough to be considered a "real" reviewer patch.

I was just double checking everything... You really done a lot of work finally, really much as I expected. My first patch was not so much ready.

As you posted another reviewer patch, once I will test everything, I will perhaps merge the 3 patches into a final one for the release manager.

Karl reasonably didn't change the status of the ticket. I definitely agree with his patch which fix a lot of typos. Thanks a lot for this reading and the associated patch which applied smoothly on the previous one.
