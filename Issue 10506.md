# Issue 10506: path to perl hardcoded in gphelp (GP/PARI)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mariah

Original creation time: 2011-01-04 19:06:11

Assignee: tdb

The first line of `/usr/bin/gphelp` has the path
to perl hardcoded rather than using 

`/usr/bin/env perl`.

This can be a problem at sites where perl is kept in a non-standard location.

Changing keywords from "" to "pari gphelp".

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Actually, the path to `perl` is not hardcoded, the first line of `gphelp` is written when PARI is installed.  So is there still a problem then?

That sounds like it could be a problem with binary releases of sage.

I guess you're right.  Anyway, it's a trivial fix to replace the first line of `doc/gphelp.in` by `#!/usr/bin/env perl`, but this should be included in #10430.

Jeroen points out that we should fix this exact issue in a whole bunch (=6) of files (and of course get this upstreamed eventually).  All probably related to the documentation.

Unfortunately some of the other files use
{{{#!/usr/bin/perl -w
```

and there is no easy `env` replacement for that.  Since `-w` only enables warnings, we could just remove that switch, but I don't think that's such a good idea.  Suggestions?

Just for the record: `perl` is not required to build PARI/GP (you get lots of warnings/errors during the build because the documentation can't be built but `gp` works fine).

There is a patch in the updated PARI spkg at #10430, so I'm closing this as duplicate.
