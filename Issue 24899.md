The monomial basis of Aguiar and Sottile (see 1.3 in â€‹http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/research/pdf/SSym.pdf ; the formula (1.13) is most important, and triangularity should do the rest, if we make sure that the order is right).

PS. Since the branch has become rather tortuous, here are all the commits that need reviewing:

Trivial rebase over one of the dependencies.

wake up patchbots

```
File "src/sage/combinat/ncsym/bases.py", line 640, in sage.combinat.ncsym.bases.NCSymBases.ElementMethods.to_wqsym
Failed example:
    (4*p[[1,3],[2]]-p[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)).to_wqsym()
Expected:
    4*M[{1, 2, 3}] + 4*M[{2}, {1, 3}] + 4*M[{1, 3}, {2}] - M[{1}]
Got:
    4*M[{2}, {1, 3}] - M[{1}] + 4*M[{1, 2, 3}] + 4*M[{1, 3}, {2}]
```

Can't reproduce this one. But it's from a few versions ago, so maybe it's fixed now.

The last patchbot is happy now, so I think this is ready to go.

FQSYM doctests now take way too long..


---

Comment by @darijgr created at 2018-06-11 19:07:09

Are they still taking too long if you pull #25326 as well? One of the things I did in #25326 was optimizing FQSym, particularly the M basis.

(NB: I don't know how long doctests *should* take on Cygwin, so I have no way to tell if I'm doing things right.)
