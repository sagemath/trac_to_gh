According to this [answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50194/interact-in-jupyterlab-vs-jupyter/) on Ask [SageMath](SageMath), starting from Sage 9.2 beta ll, we can jupyterlab using:



```
sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```

 

Running this command on [SageMath](SageMath) 9.3.beta4 gives:



```
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```



Steps to reproduce:



```
docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:develop bash

sudo apt update && \
    sudo apt install -y build-essential

sage -i jupyterlab_widgets
```

This is not specific to `jupyterlab_widgets`. 

```
$ sage -i normaliz
make: *** No rule to make target 'all-toolchain'.  Stop.
```

Whatever this docker image is prepared for, installing optional packages does not seem part of it.

```
$ ls -l sage
total 180
-rw-r--r-- 1 sage sage 66461 Dec 15 05:51 COPYING.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sage sage    53 Dec 15 05:51 VERSION.txt
drwxr-xr-x 7 sage sage  4096 Dec 15 05:51 build
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sage sage 86258 Dec 15 07:06 config.status
drwxr-xr-x 1 sage sage  4096 Dec 15 07:06 local
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sage sage  4951 Dec 15 05:51 sage
drwxr-xr-x 5 sage sage  4096 Dec 15 07:07 src
```

One notes that the top-level `Makefile` (and many other files) are missing. So no build operations are possible.

Changing priority from trivial to critical.

Also `sagemath/sagemath-dev:latest` appears to be Sage 9.0

Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]:

Probably `sagemath/sagemath:develop` should be used instead (it was updated 2 days ago).

I think that there's no `:latest` image due to a typo in 83acd7b0916e66fda4d0998132e69e441fb6c328. It's fixed already in `develop`.

These are quite different. The former is a build from a released stable version of [SageMath](SageMath) (latest=master) in a version that allows to rebuild [SageMath](SageMath). The latter is a build from the latest beta but without such tooling, i.e., only with the very basics to run [SageMath](SageMath).

I am not sure I understand what this ticket is about. The dockerhub page does not seem to mention that you should `sage -i` to install packages. You should be able `pip` install packages though. And we might want to clarify this there.

It should be quite easy to make `sage -i` work for some packages in the sagemath docker image, see #27288#comment:11. I guess all one needs to do is create a new target in `Makefile` that is a tiny bit bigger than `micro_release` and makes the `Makefile` itself and the most important bits survive.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

So, what should actually happen here? Or is this a duplicate of #27288?

Changing component from packages: standard to docker.
