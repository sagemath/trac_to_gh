`hurwitz_zeta(s,x,N)` is assumed to give N correct decimals, however in Sage 6.0:

```
sage: hurwitz_zeta(42,1,21)
-1.255404431975609756e9
sage: zeta(42.)
1.00000000000023
```

Clearly no digit is correct in `hurwitz_zeta(42,1,21)`!

indeed, however it is still bad:

```
sage: hurwitz_zeta(42,1).n(4)
4.0
```

1.000
