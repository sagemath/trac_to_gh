# Issue 12657: Remove <object> cast in real_mpfi.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12829

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2012-04-11 08:20:38

Assignee: drkirkby

Keywords: ppc64 big endian mpfi

The following is very wrong code (from `sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx`)

```
# todo: The <object> coerce is evidently to get around a weird bug in SageX (?)   
mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1.value) 
```


Surprisingly, it only breaks on PPC64.  See #11705 for more context.
