Include all these gp scripts with SAGE and make them easily usable from SAGE itself:

Just asking - does the existence of algebras/quatalg/ render this ticket invalid, or do these scripts include functionality not included in current code?

And even if they do include such functionality, do we include scripts for outside packages much any more?  I guess that is what `$SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode` is for...

Changing component from packages: standard to number theory.
