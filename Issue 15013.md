This looks very straightforward indeed.  Not enough time to review it now, though; maybe next week if nobody else does it first.

The spkg installs fine and all tests pass (using Sage 5.12.rc1 on GNU/Linux x86_64 (Ubuntu)).  The difference between PARI versions 2.5.4 and 2.5.5 is 12 bugfixes according to the PARI changelog, so it is no surprise that the upgrade is straightforward.  Positive review.
