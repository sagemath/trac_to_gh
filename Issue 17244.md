And I've installed Sage's Python on a debian-based multiarch system lacking `dpkg-dev` without problem.

I think you need to change also `build/pkgs/python2/spkg-install` and `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-install`.

Also, the author name is missing.

Positive_review modulo testing that it actually works.

Can you try building the most recent of this branch after `make distclean` on such a system? If you (or somebody else) did and it worked, you can set this ticket to positive review.
