# Issue 27242: Univariate PolynomialRing with 'negdegrevlex' order does not get 'ds' order in Singular

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27479

Original creator: rburing

Keywords: PolynomialRing, Singular, order

Using `_singular_init_()` univariate polynomial rings get global monomial ordering `lp` no matter what:


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 1, order='negdegrevlex')
sage: R._singular_init_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```


Contrast with multivariate:


```
sage: S.<y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order='negdegrevlex')
sage: S._singular_init_()
polynomial ring, over a field, local ordering
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering ds
//                  : names    y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
```


As long as `neg*` orders are allowed (see [#10708](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10708)) this should be fixed (and it seems easy to fix).
