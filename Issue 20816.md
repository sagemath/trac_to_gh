CC:  paulmasson

This simple patch allows using `edge_color` as a default color together with `edge_colors`. To test try


```
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
g.show(edge_color='red', edge_colors={'blue': [(1,2), (6,8)], 'green': [(5,8)]})
```


This is a part of #13827.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21053

Doctests pass. Documentation builds. Example runs as expected.

One minor change: make these two lines


```
+                    'edge_color': 'The default color for edges not listed in '
+                    'edge_colors.',
```


into one


```
+                    'edge_color': 'The default color for edges not listed in edge_colors.',
```


for legibility, then you can set positive review from me.
