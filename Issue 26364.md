# Issue 26364: Make all doctests in tensor/modules passed with Python 3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26601

Original creator: mmancini

CC:  egourgoulhon chapoton tscrim

Keywords: python3, @parallel, pickle

The parallelisation of the function `a.__mul__(a)` was only one test failing with `python3` in tensor/modules.
Previously, with `python2.7`, to create the partial result we used 
a list comprehension but now it fails.
We have to replace it with a for loop.

Thank you Marco!

I've checked the changes with both Python2 and Python3.
In particular, with Python3, `sage -tp --long src/sage/tensor/` returns now "All tests passed!".
