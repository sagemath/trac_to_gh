As suggested by Gawrilow in https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=544, we could create a variant of the polymake pexpect interface that does not go through pty's but rather replaces the relevant send/receive methods of pexpect by calls to `simulate_shell_input` (linking to libpolymake).

We do want to keep the current pty-based pexpect interface, though, because it may be handy for running polymake on a remote server; or for guarding against a crashing polymake (sigh).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22704

After the lrs fix on #27803, one of these 2 errors is still present:


```

I think it is deterministic, and occurs on the 1st invocation of the polymake interface.
Try starting Sage and running

```
P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='polymake')

No, there are two interface classes, which both work. `PolymakeExpect` (aliases to `Polymake`) and `PolymakeJupyMake`.
Depending on whether you have jupymake, `polymake` is set to an instance of one or the other.
