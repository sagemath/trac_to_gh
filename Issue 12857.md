Please describe why the hack in sage.rings.integer is needed.

on sage.math everything compiles fine, but upon startup

```
ImportError
...
/home/ohanar/sage-dev/sage-5.1.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/all.py in <module>()
     15                             degeneracy_coset_representatives_gamma1)
     16 
---> 17 from farey_symbol import Farey as FareySymbol
     18 
     19 

ImportError: /home/ohanar/sage-dev/sage-5.1.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.so: undefined symbol: convert_to_long
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.

```


This was from a clean sage source tarball built with the new cython.

Please update the `SPKG.txt` in the spkg, otherwise everything looks good. I would hold out on making a new spkg until you can fix #13031, since that is one of the primary reasons for upgrading.

Applied the patch + spkg to Sage 5.1beta2, and it all works good. `make ptestlong` passed all tests.

FYI, it still works in beta5. Once you update the SPKG.txt, you may mark this with a positive review.

Updated SPKG.txt and re-uploaded spkg.

Changing status from positive_review to needs_work.

Why the change from

```
cdef void _pari_trap "_pari_trap" (long errno, long retries) except *: 
```

to

```
cdef public void _pari_trap "_pari_trap" (long errno, long retries) except *: 
```

This causes a file `sage/libs/pari/gen.h` to be generated.  Either this file should not be distributed, or it should be added to `.hgignore`.


---

Comment by robertwb created at 2012-07-04 00:44:00

It's public to prevent it from being declared as static which conflicts with the declaration in pari_err.h. I've added an entry to .hgignore.

Patch rebased to sage-5.2.beta0.

Just a quick question Robert, where can I find the sources matching the spkg? Is a real cython 0.17 going to be released soon?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-07-09 07:43:01

Resolution: fixed


---

Comment by robertwb created at 2012-07-09 18:10:38

For the record, the spkg is based on the commit at https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/a7d6ec066e480eb4cf2cdebd5392e0c674b83f96 

We don't have a timeline for the 0.17 release (it's being worked on, intermittently), so we shouldn't wait on that.


---

Comment by kini created at 2012-07-09 18:12:10

Then maybe this SPKG should be versioned `cython-0.16-a7d6ec0`?


---

Comment by robertwb created at 2012-07-09 18:21:41

Fine by me, I'm just happy to see this finally get in :). When Cython 0.17 is finally released, it should be a trivial upgrade.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-07-09 21:31:54

It is just a problem sage-on-gentoo side because I don't have an upstream package. I will have to distribute an ebuild fetching the spkg until 0.17 is released. If there was a snapshot on the cython website I would prefer to use that.

I am grateful that you put that up Robert. Thanks a lot.
