This is a follow-up on #17830, which made this possible:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3)))
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
True
```

However, if I embed into a RIF instead, the same test fails.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=RIF(AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3))))
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
False
```

I do not think this is a bug.

The (respective to the embedding) comparison code is used only if there is a coercion embedding for which the codomain allows to have arbitrary precision real intervals (right now, only `AA`/`QQbar` but could be extend to `RLF`/`CLF`). I do not mean that it is not feasible to find the corresponding exact embedding from a one into `RIF` one. But I would be against using it.

What is the problem with the behavior in the ticket description?

Thanks for the discussion; I agree that it's a plausible restriction.

I have added a patch that adds this detail to the documentation of `NumberField`.
