# Issue 22692: Followup to #22666

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2017-05-02 13:29:25

Keywords: windows cygwin python3

The Python 3 build is still broken in Cygwin since #22666.  I mistakenly removed a patch that was still needed after all (or rather, I stripped away part of a patch that was still needed).
