# Issue 15859: exact computations for fractional_chromatic_index

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16096

This is the kind of functions for which exact computations are expected. Besides, there was no way to change the default LP solver used there.

I get trouble running doctests; e.g.

```
sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 388, in sage.graphs.graph
Failed example:
    G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=7, diameter=5)
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/dima/sage/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 480, in _run
        self.execute(example, compiled, test.globs)
      File "/home/dima/sage/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 839, in execute
        exec compiled in globs
      File "<doctest sage.graphs.graph[32]>", line 1, in <module>
        G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=Integer(7), diameter=Integer(5))
      File "/home/dima/sage/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_database.py", line 429, in __init__
        self.intersect(SQLQuery(graph_db, qdict), 'graph_data', join_dict,in_place=True)
      File "/home/dima/sage/sage-6.3.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/databases/sql_db.py", line 479, in __init__
        + str(query_dict['table_name']) + ".")
    ValueError: Database has no tablemisc.
```

any idea what is this?

sorry, this is not related to this ticket, but rather to the update to beta7 or beta8...

a nasty upgrade issue that took a while to solve: #16735 should have bumped the version of graphs spkg to force a reinstall, but it didn't. Resolved by manually reinstalling it.

Now it all looks good.
