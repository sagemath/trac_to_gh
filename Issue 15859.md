I get trouble running doctests; e.g.

```
sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 388, in sage.graphs.graph
Failed example:
    G = GraphQuery(display_cols=['graph6'], num_vertices=7, diameter=5)

    ValueError: Database has no tablemisc.
```

any idea what is this?
