Since [PEP-479](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/) it's deprecated to call `raise StopIteration` from within a generator (eventually this will cause a `RuntimeError` to be raised).

Per the PEP:

> Finally, the proposal also clears up the confusion about how to terminate a generator: the proper way is `return`, not `raise StopIteration`.


This fixes several generators in Sage (I think all) that used `raise StopIteration` inappropriately according to the PEP.

Turns out if you return a value from a generator with the `return` statement it will be passed as the first argument to the implicitly raised `StopIteration` so I should just do that.
