# Issue 24961: Improve handling of GCC_DEP variable in Makefile

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is a followup to #25188 that I thought was worth doing while fixing that issue.  However, since it's not strictly needed for the fix I'll make it a separate ticket.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. This was a forced push. Last 10 new commits:

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Toolchain packages are unconditionally built - it's also not addressed on #24919.
Anyhow this ought to be dealt with a follow-up to #24919.

I was lead here because Volker selected this ticket for inclusion in his merging branch and when I looked on github to see the content of the commit, it came empty. https://github.com/vbraun/sage/commit/0c158cae89a87820ee5e4bb5b7a8f9a911210aaa

Then clicking here resulted in a failure to merge.  So Volker will need to re-merge this one now.

Ping `@`vbraun the content of this ticket is currently missing in the merge.

(Edited, because I was mistaken slightly about the relation of this ticket to #24919.)

This doesn't seem right.  This branch just looks identical to the one on #25857 now.
However, this branch should not actually be merged anyways.

These changes are already included implicitly in #24919 which is positively reviewed and should be merged.

The reason this is confusing is that I worked on this ticket at the same time as #24919, but #24919 redid a lot of configure stuff so it included those changes by necessity.

If we just merge #24919, this ticket can be closed as fixed.

I take it back.  Apparently I'm wrong.  #24919 does not incorporate all elements of this ticket.  Apparently at some point I decoupled them somewhat.

I'll create a new branch...

Okay, apparently I ended up rolling this back into #25188, hence the empty merge.
