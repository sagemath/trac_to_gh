The class `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` (`sage/geometry/cone.py`) has an "advanced" constructor parameter `PPL` that can be set to a `ppl.polyhedron.C_Polyhedron`. However, before #23024, this attribute used to be set immutable in the constructor and this is not the case anymore (since pplpy does not support the mutability/immutability flag).

This ticket stands to fix the behavior.

How feasible is the first option? I imagine what has to be done is adding a flag and then making sure that it is checked in all functions (current and future) that may change the polyhedron.

Indeed, PPL has copy constructor which I believe does the right thing.
