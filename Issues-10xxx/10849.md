Whether you get the correct result or a spurious ValueError in evaluating some gamma expressions depends upon things it shouldn't.

This comes from [a sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3b7126c1a29db091#); I looked and couldn't find it here, but possibly it's a duplicate.  (I have bad luck with trac.)
See also [this worksheet](http://demo.sagenb.org/home/pub/66/).

Here's a relatively simple test case, in 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.rc0:

```
sage: x = var("x")
sage: f = exp(gamma(I*x-1/2).subs(x=I*x))
sage: g=f.operands()[0]
sage: g, type(g)
(gamma(-x - 1/2), <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>)
sage: g(x=0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

That is, merely performing the should-be-irrelevant "gamma(-x-1/2)*g" op makes g(x=0) start working.  Instrumenting it shows that that py_doublefactorial gets a -3 the first time instead of the 1 it does the second time, but I couldn't quite follow the calling order to isolate the error.

Mike is right and the patch at #10064 resolves this issue.

The side effect is a result of GiNaC's reference counted pointers. Whenever two expressions compare equal, GiNaC frees the memory of one, and makes it a pointer to the other. In this example, it replaces `-x - 1/2` where the coefficient of `x` is in QQ(i), with `-x - 1/2` where the coefficient is just an `int`.

```
sage: t = -x -1/2
sage: t
-x - 1/2
sage: t.operands()
[-x, -1/2]
sage: t.operands()[0]
-x
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()
[x, -1]
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()[1]
-1
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()[1].pyobject()
-1
sage: type(t.operands()[0].operands()[1].pyobject())
<type 'int'>
```

Of course there is a chance that this observation changed the result. :)

For `g`, this looks like a different bug:

```
sage: g
gamma(-x - 1/2)
sage: g.operands()[0]
-x - 1/2
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()
[x, -1/2]
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()[0]
x
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()[0].operands()
[]
```

We'll still have to check whether the patch still applies cleanly when the other ticket has been merged (at which point a lot of unrelated changes may have made their way into Sage too). That would keep me from giving it the sort of preliminary positive review you suggest.

But if what you're saying is the standard way of handling these things, then I'll raise no objection.
