Whether you get the correct result or a spurious ValueError in evaluating some gamma expressions depends upon things it shouldn't.

This comes from [a sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3b7126c1a29db091#); I looked and couldn't find it here, but possibly it's a duplicate.  (I have bad luck with trac.)
See also [this worksheet](http://demo.sagenb.org/home/pub/66/).

Here's a relatively simple test case, in 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.rc0:

```
sage: x = var("x")
sage: f = exp(gamma(I*x-1/2).subs(x=I*x))
sage: g=f.operands()[0]
sage: g, type(g)
(gamma(-x - 1/2), <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>)
sage: g(x=0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ValueError: argument must be >= -1
sage: gamma(-x-1/2)*g
gamma(-x - 1/2)^2
sage: g(x=0)

```

That is, merely performing the should-be-irrelevant "gamma(-x-1/2)*g" op makes g(x=0) start working.  Instrumenting it shows that that py_doublefactorial gets a -3 the first time instead of the 1 it does the second time, but I couldn't quite follow the calling order to isolate the error.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Mike is right and the patch at #10064 resolves this issue.

The side effect is a result of GiNaC's reference counted pointers. Whenever two expressions compare equal, GiNaC frees the memory of one, and makes it a pointer to the other. In this example, it replaces `-x - 1/2` where the coefficient of `x` is in QQ(i), with `-x - 1/2` where the coefficient is just an `int`.

```
sage: t = -x -1/2
sage: t
-x - 1/2
sage: t.operands()
[-x, -1/2]
sage: t.operands()[0]
-x
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()
[x, -1]
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()[1]
-1
sage: t.operands()[0].operands()[1].pyobject()
-1
sage: type(t.operands()[0].operands()[1].pyobject())
<type 'int'>
```

Of course there is a chance that this observation changed the result. :)

For `g`, this looks like a different bug:

```
sage: g
gamma(-x - 1/2)
sage: g.operands()[0]
-x - 1/2
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()
[x, -1/2]
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()[0]
x
sage: g.operands()[0].operands()[0].operands()
[]
```

+Whether you get the correct result or a spurious ValueError in evaluating some gamma expressions depends upon things it shouldn't.
 
+This comes from [a sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3b7126c1a29db091#); I looked and couldn't find it here, but possibly it's a duplicate.  (I have bad luck with trac.)
