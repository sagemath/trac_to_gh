```
With an unpatched sage-4.6, we have:

```
sage: R1 = ZZ.extension(x**2+1,'i')
sage: R1 is ZZ.extension(x**2+1,'i')
False
sage: R1 is ZZ.extension(x**2+1,'i')
False
```

I think that should be changed.

That was exactly my first thought as well, we should not require the list of generators to be a tuple. (As well as breaking convention, this will break people's existing code.) 

Much better to just convert gens to a tuple in the called function.

Dear David, dear Robert

There is a convenient way: Everything is based on the function `sage.rings.number_field.order.absolute_order_from_module_generators`. This function is not supposed to be called directly, if I understand correctly. Hence, it won't hurt to change the expected input of that function (or of `sage.rings.number_field.order.absolute_order_from_ring_generators`).

My solution is:
* Prepend `sage.rings.number_field.order.absolute_order_from_module_generators` with `@cached_function`.
* The generators must form a tuple, so, the internals of some methods need to be adapted.
* In addition to the tuple of generators, I suggest that the field is passed as an argument as well.

The last point is for preventing coercion trouble: If there is a coercion from number field K to number field L and if only the tuple of generators would be cached, then orders in K would be identic to orders in L. Therefore, the field *must* be included in the cache data.

Anyway. I reverted part of the doctests, so that we have tests where `K.order(...)` is called with a single element, with a list of elements, or with a tuple of elements. And of course we have a new test for the cache. Ready for review, I guess.

There is a risk of this breaking garbage collection of number fields. 

The number field code is quite carefully written so that number fields are globally unique, but only weak references to them are cached, so the uniqueness doesn't mean they hang around in memory longer than they should. The patch here would have the disadvantage that as soon as one created any order in a number field, the order (and hence also its parent number field) would hang around for the rest of the Sage session, as an entry in the cache of `absolute_order_from_module_generators`. 

(Using `UniqueFactory` wouldn't solve this; it would cache weak references so that orders could still be garbage collected, but these weakrefs would be stored in a cache whose *keys* included the number field, so the number field still couldn't be garbage collected.)

The best solution I can think of would be to store orders in a cache which was itself an attribute of the parent number field. This could be implemented by making `order` tuplify its arguments and then call a second *method* `_order_from_cache`, implemented using `@cached_method` as usual. Then the second method's cache is then an attribute of the number field, and hence (a) there is no need to include the number field in the arguments, and (b) the number field and the orders can be garbage collected without problems.

Hi David,

Currently I try to produce a patch according to your suggestions. However:

Replying to [@loefflerd](#comment%3A11):
> There is a risk of this breaking garbage collection of number fields. 
> 
> The number field code is quite carefully written so that number fields are globally unique...

That's not true.

```
sage: K.<z7> = QuadraticField(7)
sage: K is loads(dumps(K))
False
```

> The best solution I can think of would be to store orders in a cache which was itself an attribute of the parent number field. This could be implemented by making `order` tuplify its arguments and then call a second *method* `_order_from_cache`, implemented using `@cached_method` as usual.

Doing so, there is indeed uniqueness of orders, and that should also be useful for pickling. However, number fields are not unique parents, and so orders can only be unique in their number fields, but not globally.
