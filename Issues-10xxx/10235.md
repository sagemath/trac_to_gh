This is needed in order to build Singular on Cygwin.  It has been in previous releases, but I don't know why it is gone now.  This has happened before; see:

http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg02800.html

and

http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg02767.html

Depends on #11550

Yes, I just checked and it is indeed in there (in the `src/Singular/` directory, where I hadn't looked beforehand, only toplevel).

However, this is only mentioned in one place in the SPKG.txt, just as an update from four years ago, so I would say that solving this requires changing SPKG.txt to mention this, as you say.  However, that could in principle be added in some other ticket, so as not to multiply p's beyond belief.

Wie Du weisst, der Feind des Guten ist das Bessere... ;-)

But you could just search for a file named `Singular.rc` or `singular.rc` on your Cygwin installation, since if Singular there doesn't work without its template file, there must be something installed which was generated from it, perhaps in your Cygwin home directory or somewhere in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular`, or `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

(`spkg/logs/singular-*.log` perhaps gives some hint.)

I won't object giving this ticket a positive review when a positively reviewed p11 at #11550 has just the comment you added in `SPKG.txt`. I don't care much about Cygwin anyway... B)

Provisional positive review; I'll revert the status in case something unexpected should happen with the p13 at #11550 (which I've added as a dependency anyway).

P.S.: I also checked that the build on Cygwin should fail in the case `Singular.rc.in` was **not** present.

Really?  How?  You mean in spkg-install?  I don't see anything relevant there.  Did you trace through the actual Singular build scripts?  Hut ab!

`Singular.rc` depends on, i.e. is generated from `Singular.rc.in`; the former is used to generate some object files with `windres` on Cygwin / Windows (`{Singular,ESingular,TSingular}_res.o`), which are then linked to the executables (`Singular.exe`, `runESingular.exe` and `runTSingular.exe`).

`grep` is your friend.
