<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

On my Mac, with the old version compilation is done with commands like

```
  ï¿½cc -Os -ffast-math -DBsd  -DUSEPNG ...
```
while with the new version, I see

```
  gcc -Os -ffast-math -DBsd  -DUSEPNG ...
```
Compilation succeeds in both cases, and tachyon seems to work in both cases.

The spkg looks good, mercurial repo is good -- thanks for checking in the previously unchecked files.

I've now removed the default RANLIB setting in the `Make-arch` completely. Just like CC, the Makefile should just use Sage's RANLIB environment variable. Which happens to be `RANLIB=ranlib`, so ranlib is run on `libtachyon.a`.

Right now Sage is already running ranlib (usually via libtool) on pretty much every static library:

```
[vbraun@volker-two sage]$ grep ranlib install.log  | wc
    274     881   10282
```

Updated spkg is at the same location. I've also refreshed the `Make-arch.patch`.
