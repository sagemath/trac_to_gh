Hi, the patch applies and works, 
although with fuzz (due to your older patches for sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py, 
I presume).

I don't know, perhaps you should think of rebasing it so that all your recent patches for permgroup.py apply one after
another without a problem?

Yes, I should.  I was not very careful about how I stacked them, since I didn't want to have a long list of dependencies for reviewers.  But I do need to get things organized so the release manager can apply them without problems, as well.

I'm away most of today, but will get this one fixed and make #10921 follow it.

Thanks,
Rob
