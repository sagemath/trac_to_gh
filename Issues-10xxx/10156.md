If all this works, I think that #10156 and #10157 are proven to work.

I don't see why.  If we really rename `makefile` to `Makefile`, there is no reason to use `[Mm]akefile`.

The Sage library patch looks fine. 

For the scripts patch, I haven't tested it at all, but what happens if you upgrade from a version of Sage with a file called "makefile"?  Will things break?  I don't think it's ever a good idea to run "sage-sdist" or "sage-bdist" from an upgraded version of Sage, but if someone does, what will happen?  Would it be a good idea to either use something like [Mm]akefile, as leif suggested, or do something like the following:

```sh
if [ -e makefile ]; then
   cp -$OPT makefile "$TMP"/Makefile
fi
```
(This is for sage-bdist, and you would use something similar in sage-sdist.)

W.r.t. making new dists from an upgraded version, hopefully #9433 solves this... ;-)

(I don't know if you meant upgrading in general; this works for me. You just still have the old `makefile`.)


> I don't think it's ever a good idea to run "sage-sdist" or "sage-bdist" from an upgraded version of Sage [...]

Nobody should do this, currently.

We should perhaps just give an error message in that case (until #9433 is merged).

Of course. But I would *rename* it because (POSIX) `make` gives `makefile` precedence over `Makefile` and we don't want to cause confusion.

It seems just dangerous to delete `makefile` during a Sage build/upgrade.\n\nCan any of you implement this?",

On the other hand, if `makefile` and `Makefile` are identical files, it shouldn't matter.  It seems just dangerous to delete `makefile` during a Sage build/upgrade.

Can any of you implement this?

Note that on OS X, you can't have files called both "makefile" and "Makefile" in the same directory.  Also, "makefile" is not used at all during an upgrade, so it should be safe to rename it.

> Can any of you implement this?

It's taken care of by #9433.  If we want to implement it here, I think it should be done in the sage-upgrade script, after running "./install" and checking its exit status:

Another option would also check for the existence of 'Makefile' before doing the move:

The first two patches (10156_docs.patch and 10156_scripts.patch) get a positive review from me.

This doesn't work, probably my fault.  The issue is that the script "sage-upgrade" doesn't get upgraded in the process.  So I think moving makefile should happen at the end of the "install" script instead, since this gets downloaded before it gets run.  (In particular, upgrading didn't rename "makefile" when I tested it.)  Try this patch to "install" instead.

It looks to me there are still a few files that refer to `makefile`. Shall I create a ticket for these:

```
