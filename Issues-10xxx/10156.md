W.r.t. making new dists from an upgraded version, hopefully #9433 solves this... ;-)

(I don't know if you meant upgrading in general; this works for me. You just still have the old `makefile`.)


> I don't think it's ever a good idea to run "sage-sdist" or "sage-bdist" from an upgraded version of Sage [...]


Nobody should do this, currently.

We should perhaps just give an error message in that case (until #9433 is merged).

Note that on OS X, you can't have files called both "makefile" and "Makefile" in the same directory.  Also, "makefile" is not used at all during an upgrade, so it should be safe to rename it.

It's taken care of by #9433.  If we want to implement it here, I think it should be done in the sage-upgrade script, after running "./install" and checking its exit status:

```diff

```
Another option would also check for the existence of 'Makefile' before doing the move:

```diff

Opinions either way?

Yes, it is very possible. I'm just going to build Sage again from scratch, as I've messed around with various files. But I very much doubt I built the pdfs, so that explains it.
