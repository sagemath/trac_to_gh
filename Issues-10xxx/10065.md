Poset.dual contained a bug:

```
P = Poset(([1,2],[[1,2]]))
Q = P.dual()
Q.show()
... AssertionError: `self` should be an acyclic graph
```

The patch contains the solution for this bug as well as new methods
is_lattice
is_isomorphic
is_selfdual
panyushev_complement
panyushev_orbits

The procedure **is_isomorphic** has two problems :

* one doctest is failing (see the report of the build bot). This is related to a deprecated use of size instead of cardinality, somewhere. Maybe we should correct this deprecated use first.

* it fails on Lattices

```
P=Posets.PentagonPoset()
P.is_isomorphic(P)
ValueError: The input is not a finite poset.
```

Maybe this can be corrected by having a method **is_isomorphic** for Lattices which is inherited from Posets.

One more thing to be corrected :

The doc of !**panyushev_orbits!** is badly formatted. It does not display correctly in the notebook.

I only updated the doctest - the size/cardinality is in generic_graph.py. I am in the process to make changes to the is_isomorphic method in there anyway. I will make this little change in that other patch.

This was just a minor mistake in the is_isomorphic method for Posets. I updated it.

Done...

Sorry Fred, I often forget to rebuild before making the test... if I didn't do more mistakes, it should work now.

`@`Franco: I also had to edit the patches

trac_6641-poset_antichains_backtracker.patch
addon_poset_antichains_backtracker-cs.patch

(and uploaded them to the combinat queue) for ticket #6641. Could you probably fold them and add them to your ticket? Thanks!
