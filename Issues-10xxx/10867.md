This patch introduces some nice graphics routines to the BinaryQF class for displaying (filled) level sets Q(x,y) = m, against the integer lattice, and for highlighting the lattice points on the level set.  There are also additional options for customizing the resulting graphic (size, color, thickness, etc.).

Note: This code presently only applies to positive definite binary quadratic forms.
