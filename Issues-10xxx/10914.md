Running

```
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),(x,0,2*pi))
```
gives 0, but the correct result is 4.

This happens in version 4.6.1 . In 4.5.3, the integral was not evaluated at all.

Certainly the integral better be positive!  

This is wrong in Maxima (5.23.2), though it does get the one arch problem correct:

```
Maxima 5.23.2 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.24
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,2*%pi);
(%o1)                                  0
(%i2) integrate(sin(x),x,0,%pi/2);
(%o2)                                  1
(%i3) 
```

This is now Maxima bug 3211915.

`shouln't`?

Anyway, this is fine, but the style is a little too informal - those not having read the ticket will be mystified, and shouldn't have to go to the ticket to find out.  So I'm uploading the same patch but with slightly different wording.

Notwithstanding that this file doesn't appear to be in the reference manual in any case.
