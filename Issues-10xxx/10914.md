Running

```
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),(x,0,2*pi))
```
gives 0, but the correct result is 4.

This happens in version 4.6.1 . In 4.5.3, the integral was not evaluated at all.

Apply [attachment:trac_10914.patch].

**Assignee:** @burcin

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman

**Author:** Michael Orlitzky

**Merged:** sage-5.0.beta14

**Resolution:** fixed

Certainly the integral better be positive!  

This is wrong in Maxima (5.23.2), though it does get the one arch problem correct:

```
Maxima 5.23.2 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.0.24
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,2*%pi);
(%o1)                                  0
(%i2) integrate(sin(x),x,0,%pi/2);
(%o2)                                  1
(%i3) 
```

This is now Maxima bug 3211915.
