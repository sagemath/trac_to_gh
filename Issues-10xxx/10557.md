I added a missing semicolon. Other than that it looks good. I've tested it and it works, too. So I'm giving it a positive review, but since you say it should be added to #10430 I'll leave it to you how to proceed.

So essentially you're saying that the bug is a non-bug?  If `GPDOCDIR` really takes precedence and if `GPDOCDIR` is always set in Sage, then I see no reason to "fix" anything.
