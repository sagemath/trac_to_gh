The `setup.py` for cython modules 
* does not record dependencies on C/C++ headers, 
* incorrectly assumes that all C/C++ headers end in '.h'.
I think both are undesirable. In particular, C++ headers often do not end in '.h', for example STL-style headers tend to do away with file extensions altogether. But `setup.py` relies on this:

```
   if not found_include:
       if path[-2:] != '.h':  # there are implicit headers from distutils, etc
           raise IOError, "could not find dependency %s included in %s."%(path, filename)
```
I also don't get what "implicit headers from distutil" are; The above if-clause really discards all C headers from the dependency list. 

I've modified `setup.py` to add all C/C++ headers to the dependencies and made sure that the relevant directories are searched for them. Patch is attached.

I am looking at this patch as part of getting your ppl work into sage-on-gentoo.
One question about this part of the patch:

```
+include_dirs = ['%s/include'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/sage/sage/ext'%SAGE_DEVEL,
+                '%s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL]
```
Why do you add the last bit: %s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL, this
just duplicate the content of '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL which should be
in place already. In any case one of the two is superfluous (and make my
porting work harder).

I am looking at this patch again. I am not sure about the last two lines in this section:

```
extra_include_dirs = ['%s/include/python2.6'%SAGE_LOCAL, 
                 # finally, standard C/C++ include dirs 
                 '/usr/local/include/',    
                 '/usr/include'] 
```
Are they really necessary? Shouldn't a standard compiler look into these by default. After all the 
other -I... arguments have been searched without success. Furthermore in a scenario where
someone has installed their own compiler and want to use it rather the system, and have even installed
there own libraries compiled with it (like a prefix basically but it doesn't have to be that complete) that
means system headers may be put before their own installed headers. It is not a very nice situation
which may be hard to debug.

Of course you could argue that it is not a likely scenario but it could happen. There may be more
people than we think that use their own compilers rather than the system one.
