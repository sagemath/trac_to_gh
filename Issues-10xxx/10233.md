The `setup.py` for cython modules 
* does not record dependencies on C/C++ headers, 
* incorrectly assumes that all C/C++ headers end in '.h'.
I think both are undesirable. In particular, C++ headers often do not end in '.h', for example STL-style headers tend to do away with file extensions altogether. But `setup.py` relies on this:

```
   if not found_include:
       if path[-2:] != '.h':  # there are implicit headers from distutils, etc
           raise IOError, "could not find dependency %s included in %s."%(path, filename)
```
I also don't get what "implicit headers from distutil" are; The above if-clause really discards all C headers from the dependency list. 

I've modified `setup.py` to add all C/C++ headers to the dependencies and made sure that the relevant directories are searched for them. Patch is attached.

I am looking at this patch as part of getting your ppl work into sage-on-gentoo.
One question about this part of the patch:

```
+include_dirs = ['%s/include'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/sage/sage/ext'%SAGE_DEVEL,
+                '%s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL]
```
Why do you add the last bit: %s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL, this
just duplicate the content of '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL which should be
in place already. In any case one of the two is superfluous (and make my
porting work harder).

I am looking at this patch again. I am not sure about the last two lines in this section:

```
extra_include_dirs = ['%s/include/python2.6'%SAGE_LOCAL, 
                 # finally, standard C/C++ include dirs 
                 '/usr/local/include/',    
                 '/usr/include'] 
```
Are they really necessary? Shouldn't a standard compiler look into these by default. After all the 
other -I... arguments have been searched without success. Furthermore in a scenario where
someone has installed their own compiler and want to use it rather the system, and have even installed
there own libraries compiled with it (like a prefix basically but it doesn't have to be that complete) that
means system headers may be put before their own installed headers. It is not a very nice situation
which may be hard to debug.

Of course you could argue that it is not a likely scenario but it could happen. There may be more
people than we think that use their own compilers rather than the system one.

Note that `include_dirs` / `extra_include_dirs` are only the directories searched for dependencies. If the dependencies are newer than the cython source, the cython module is recompiled. But these directories are not passed on to the cython compilation. 

Arguably `/usr/include` and friends is not necessary. Listing it here only means that if you upgrade the system compiler then the cython modules will be rebuilt. Although a rare occurrence, I think that this is how it should be.

I can see the sense in that. I may have an opportunity to see how everything pans out from a gentoo prefix on OS X,
