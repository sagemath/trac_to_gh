The `setup.py` for cython modules 
* does not record dependencies on C/C++ headers, 
* incorrectly assumes that all C/C++ headers end in '.h'.
I think both are undesirable. In particular, C++ headers often do not end in '.h', for example STL-style headers tend to do away with file extensions altogether. But `setup.py` relies on this:

```
   if not found_include:
       if path[-2:] != '.h':  # there are implicit headers from distutils, etc
           raise IOError, "could not find dependency %s included in %s."%(path, filename)
```
I also don't get what "implicit headers from distutil" are; The above if-clause really discards all C headers from the dependency list. 

I've modified `setup.py` to add all C/C++ headers to the dependencies and made sure that the relevant directories are searched for them. Patch is attached.

I am looking at this patch as part of getting your ppl work into sage-on-gentoo.
One question about this part of the patch:

```
+include_dirs = ['%s/include'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL,
+                '%s/sage/sage/ext'%SAGE_DEVEL,
+                '%s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL]
```
Why do you add the last bit: %s/sage/c_lib/include'%SAGE_DEVEL, this
just duplicate the content of '%s/include/csage'%SAGE_LOCAL which should be
in place already. In any case one of the two is superfluous (and make my
porting work harder).

Of course you could argue that it is not a likely scenario but it could happen. There may be more
