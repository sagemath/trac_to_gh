This package installs PyOpenCl (a nice GPU programming tool) from Andreas Kloeckner into Sage.

For more Info see http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl

**For installation:**
* Install OpenCL on your machine (This is contained for example in 
 CUDA for NVIDIA Cards: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html) or STREAM for ATI cards: http://developer.amd.com/gpu/atistreamsdk/pages/default.aspx; INTEL is not supported yet, but they announced it for 2011!)
 
* Download the package at http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=pyopencl-0.92.spkg 
(direct link: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pyopencl-0.92.spkg)
* install it.
* **IMPORTANT:** After installation the setuptools package has to be reinstalled!! Because the installer uses the distributed egg package. This messes somehow with setuptools and will be removed after the installation. But this destroys setup tools! 
* enjoy!

**Update:** With the new version of setuptools-0.6c11 (see #10361) the reinstall of setuptools become obsolete. You can download the patched version of pyopencl here: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pyopencl-0.92.p0.spkg
