The following code seems to crash Sage on some (but not all) systems:

```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: R.<x>  = a.parent()[]
sage: (x - a).change_ring(RR) # boom!
```

This bug was originally spotted when calculating char polys of symbolic matrices:

```
sage: a,b,c= var('a,b,c')
sage: mprime = matrix([[01,b+1,2],[a+1,2,1],[2,1,c+1]])
sage: cp = mprime.charpoly()
sage: cp.real_roots() # boom!
```
See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/0ea6c973a56191ab/e91868cd98f7fb74).

FWIW, it crashes on my OpenSolaris machine. I've not looked in detail, but it seems to be something calling mpfr_clear in MPFR. Of course that does **not** mean it is an MPFR bug, but that's where the crash is occuring.
