I will need to think some more about this.  After hearing about this bug, I built 4.6.alpha2 on my Mac OS 10.6 machine and ran the doctests there, all of which passed without errors.

```
./sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/tensor/differential_forms.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/tensor/differential_forms.py"
	 [4.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.8 seconds
```

I am currently building Sage on my Linux machine and hope to be able to reproduce that bug shortly.  In the meantime, could this be due to `cmp` behaving differently on different platforms?  This would seem very weird to me...

The problem seems to be in the coordinate patch code, I think.

Notice that:

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: (x,y,z)<(y,x,z)
x < y
```

I think that comparing tuples of symbolic variables is not well-defined.  Instead, you might compare strings (i.e., call str() on each tuple)

I meant, do you want to force a total order on the set of coordinates?  In other words, what does (q,q',p,p')<(q,p,q',p') mean?  Or do you just want to have equality testing, i.e., you can tell that (q,q',p,p') != (q,p,q',p')?

Regardless, I think resolving that design issue should be a separate ticket.

I've put this up for review as #10053.  This patch just takes out the calls to the `__cmp__` member functions and replaces them with equivalent calls to `__eq__`.

Just for the record:

I now get this doctest error after upgrade-testing (#9896) with Sage 4.6.alpha3 (in-place upgrade from 4.5.3) on Ubuntu 9.04 x86, Pentium4 Prescott with SSE enabled (in CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS).

In the build from scratch on the same machine, with the same settings, I didn't get that error.
