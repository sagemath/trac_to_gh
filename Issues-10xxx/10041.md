<a id='comment:2'></a>I will need to think some more about this.  After hearing about this bug, I built 4.6.alpha2 on my Mac OS 10.6 machine and ran the doctests there, all of which passed without errors.

```

All tests passed!

I am currently building Sage on my Linux machine and hope to be able to reproduce that bug shortly.  In the meantime, could this be due to `cmp` behaving differently on different platforms?  This would seem very weird to me...

Notice that:

```

The failing doctest now passes for me on cicero and fulvia.  If someone else can confirm that it passes on some other machines (on ones where it passed before, we should make sure it still passes), feel free to give it a positive review.

Should this ticket be marked as "needs review"?

Regardless, I think resolving that design issue should be a separate ticket.

Good point -- that wouldn't make sense indeed.

I've put this up for review as #10053.  This patch just takes out the calls to the `__cmp__` member functions and replaces them with equivalent calls to `__eq__`.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Just for the record:

I now get this doctest error after upgrade-testing (#9896) with Sage 4.6.alpha3 (in-place upgrade from 4.5.3) on Ubuntu 9.04 x86, Pentium4 Prescott with SSE enabled (in CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS).

In the build from scratch on the same machine, with the same settings, I didn't get that error.
