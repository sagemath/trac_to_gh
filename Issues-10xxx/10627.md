On [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/303/displaying-matrices-with-instead-of-0), it has been suggested that we should be able to print matrices using `.` instead of `0`.  We could also use a space instead of `0`.  Perhaps we could print `+` instead of `1` and `-` instead of `-1` for a (1,-1)-matrix.  All of these could be implemented by passing optional arguments to the `str` method for matrices, for example 

```
    sage: mat = random_matrix(ZZ, 50)
    sage: mat.str(zero='.')
```
or

```
    sage: mat.str(use_dot=True)
```
We need to figure out what options to allow for right now (although we can add more later) and what syntax to use for them.

Perhaps we could pass a map for how to display things like:

```
    sage: mat = random_matrix(ZZ, 50)
    sage: mat.str({0:'.',1:'+',-1:'-'})
```

Then we could map things arbitrarily.  It might not as easy to remember or use, but it would allow the user to do anything they wanted.  I can't think when it might be useful except perhaps to make matrices of group elements more understandable or for a mathematical puzzle in which the numbers are encoded as symbols.  

Actually it might be useful to show some oft repeated but complicated elements as a single letter like GAP does when displaying character tables.  For that to be really useful it would be best if it were automatic, but that's probably too much to ask.

This ticket would be very useful to me.  In my research, we deal with completing matrices, so we often represent matrices using +, -, and 0 (or ".") to represent positive, negative, or zero entries.  Having an easy way to print out such a matrix would be nice.

I find things like `use_dot=True` get complicated fast.  As the options and possibilities increase, the keyword management becomes a morass.

I'd argue for

```
mat.str(zero=' ', plus_one='+', minus_one='-')
```

and think those three could be a good start.

How about having our cake and eating it too?  One argument, and it is a dictionary, then use it for translations.  Keywords, with or without a dictionary, create over-riding entries of the translation dictionary.

Then the code just checks for keys in the dictionary before setting an entry.

This would be nice for adjacency/incidence matrices of graphs.

$0.02 worth,
Rob

How about a keyword that is a dictionary *or* a function?  Then I could do something like:

def print_entry(x):
