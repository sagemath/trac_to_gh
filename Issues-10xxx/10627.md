On [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/303/displaying-matrices-with-instead-of-0), it has been suggested that we should be able to print matrices using `.` instead of `0`.  We could also use a space instead of `0`.  Perhaps we could print `+` instead of `1` and `-` instead of `-1` for a (1,-1)-matrix.  All of these could be implemented by passing optional arguments to the `str` method for matrices, for example 

```
    sage: mat = random_matrix(ZZ, 50)
    sage: mat.str(zero='.')
```
or

```
    sage: mat.str(use_dot=True)
```
We need to figure out what options to allow for right now (although we can add more later) and what syntax to use for them.

Perhaps we could pass a map for how to display things like:

```
    sage: mat = random_matrix(ZZ, 50)
    sage: mat.str({0:'.',1:'+',-1:'-'})
```

Then we could map things arbitrarily.  It might not as easy to remember or use, but it would allow the user to do anything they wanted.  I can't think when it might be useful except perhaps to make matrices of group elements more understandable or for a mathematical puzzle in which the numbers are encoded as symbols.  

Actually it might be useful to show some oft repeated but complicated elements as a single letter like GAP does when displaying character tables.  For that to be really useful it would be best if it were automatic, but that's probably too much to ask.

I find things like `use_dot=True` get complicated fast.  As the options and possibilities increase, the keyword management becomes a morass.

I'd argue for

```
mat.str(zero=' ', plus_one='+', minus_one='-')
```

and think those three could be a good start.

How about having our cake and eating it too?  One argument, and it is a dictionary, then use it for translations.  Keywords, with or without a dictionary, create over-riding entries of the translation dictionary.

Then the code just checks for keys in the dictionary before setting an entry.

This would be nice for adjacency/incidence matrices of graphs.

$0.02 worth,
Rob
