This was reported by the "report a problem" link:

The reduced_basis for number fields applies LLL to basis of the maximal order in order to get a reduced basis. The problem is that after applying LLL, it multiples the transformation matrix by the vector [1,a,a<sup>2</sup>,...], where 'a' is generator of the field - instead of using the vector it actually used for the maximal order.

How to reproduce:

```
x = QQ['x'].0
k = NumberField(x^6 + 2218926655879913714112*x^4 - \
32507675650290949030789018433536*x^3 + \
4923635504174417014460581055002374467948544*x^2 - \
36066074010564497464129951249279114076897746988630016*x + \
264187244046129768986806800244258952598300346857154900812365824,'a')
new_basis = k.reduced_basis()
print new_basis[0].minpoly()
```
This prints a crazy big polynomial. Looking a bit at what is returned it is clear that reduced_basis is multiplying the transformation matrix by the wrong vector.

To solve you just need to multiply by the vector of generators of the maximal order:

```
mp = pari( k.Minkowski_embedding(k.maximal_order().gens(), prec=120) )
ml = sage.libs.pari.gen.gen.qflll(mp)
T = matrix([[ZZ(y) for y in list(x)] for x in list(ml)]).transpose()
r = Matrix(O.gens())* T
for rr in r[0]:
print rr.minpoly()
```
This works fine.

While the original diagnosis is not wrong, there is a more basic problem as this smaller example shows:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-10)
sage: ZK = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: ZK.basis()
[1/3*a^2 + 1/3*a + 1/3, a, a^2]
sage: ZK([1,2,3])
3*a^2 + 2*a + 1
```
Although the ring of integers is an order which knows its own Z-basis, when you construct an element of the order from an integer vector it ignores that and uses the power_basis of the field and not its integral basis.

I think the problem is in these lines of _element_constructor() (order.py lines 1142-1143):

```
       if not is_Element(x) or x.parent() is not self._K:
            x = self._K(x)
```

There appears to be a related problem in the constructor of OrderElementAbsolute in number_field_element:

```
       K = order.number_field()
        NumberFieldElement_absolute.__init__(self, K, f)
        self._number_field = K
```
where the parameter f is not documented and there are no relevant tests, but this seems to be saying "take the data in f and construct a field element from it".

Perhaps the simplest solution is to go to those lines in order.py and insert code to handle the case where the input data is an integer vector of the right length.

Sure, why not.

I would be fine to not store it.
