This works.  I'm not quite sure why - is all R doc in UTF-8 now? maybe this happened with the last R upgrade - but it does.  

Positive review if we can't think of a way to doctest this.  Is this something we can doctest using `EMBEDDED_MODE`?  cc:ing in a few people who might know the answer to that question.

Apparently it is.

I've added a doctest for this.  There are warnings, but they are ok - I think they are just because of the R formatting.  Warnings of this type do not affect passing doctests.
