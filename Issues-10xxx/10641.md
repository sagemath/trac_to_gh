In
 sage.misc.package.install_all_optional_packages
the arguments (for instance `force-bool`, `dry_run-bool`), and `True` and `False` should be written in verbatim font.

Moreover, examples should be interpreted as such.

I'm trying to fix this bug, but I don't understand what you mean by "the arguments should be written in verbatim"?

An example is worth a thousand words. I encourage you to actually inspect the file

```
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/package.py
```

to understand how to properly format function arguments and examples. Use a pair of double back ticks to delimit a word or expression as verbatim, e.g.

```
This word is ``verbatim``.
```

See also examples in other source files in the Sage library for more formatting examples, e.g.

```
SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/randstate.pyx
```
