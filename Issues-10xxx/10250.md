This code worked in Sage 4.5.2.  I just realized that it now gives a segfault in 4.6.  Does anyone know what is going on?

```
sage: A=matrix(QQ, [[2,1],[0,3]])
sage: eval, evecs,mult=A.eigenvectors_right()[0]
sage: evec=evecs[0]
sage: unitevec=evec/evec.norm()
sage: unitevec
(1/2*sqrt(2), 1/2*sqrt(2))
sage: parent(eval)
Rational Field
sage: eval
3
```
and then:

```
sage: w=(SR2)(unitevec)
sage: parent(w) # works fine
Vector space of dimension 2 over Symbolic Ring
sage: eval*w
(3/2*sqrt(2), 3/2*sqrt(2))
```
but here's the problem:

```
sage: parent(unitevec) # gives problem
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Symbolic Ring
User basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: eval*unitevec


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------ 
```

Here is a backtrace using sage -gdb, which indicates a problem in ginac or pynac.

```
sage: eval*unitevec

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.

<a id='comment:1'></a>
This is puzzling that this works, though:

```
sage: V=(SR^2).subspace_with_basis([[1,1]])
sage: v=V([sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2])
sage: parent(v)
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Symbolic Ring
User basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: QQ(3)*v
(3/2*sqrt(2), 3/2*sqrt(2))
```

So apparently creating the vector manually (rather than getting it as an eigenvector of a matrix) works okay.

Ccing Robert B and Craig Citro, since it looks like it might be a problem in the coercion system, and maybe in how the coercion system builds a module with a user basis:

```
sage: V=(QQ^2).span_of_basis([[1,1]])
sage: v=V([1,1])
sage: w=v.change_ring(SR)
sage: w.parent()
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Symbolic Ring
User basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: 3*w
(3, 3)
sage: x=sqrt(2)*v # here the coercion system builds the parent of x
sage: x.parent() is w.parent()
False
sage: x.parent()
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 1 over Symbolic Ring
User basis matrix:
[1 1]
sage: x.parent() == w.parent() # equivalent parents between x and w
True
sage: 3*x # but we get a segfault when multiplying x by something


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------



```

Also, notice that trying to get the coercion system to explain itself also segfaults:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model(); cm
<sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel_cache_maps object at 0x101f3b6b0>
sage: sage: V=(QQ^2).span_of_basis([[1,1]])
sage: v=V([1,1])
sage: x=sqrt(2)*v
sage: cm.explain(3.parent(), x.parent())


------------------------------------------------------------

This works in Sage 4.4.4, and doesn't have anything to do with Pynac, as you now suspect.

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: get_systems('diff(3*y,y)')

but in your example I get

```
sage: get_systems('3*x')

The problem seems to be that the coercion ends up calling `__rmul__` (which is inherited) and not `_rmul_` (which is directly defined in `FreeModuleElement_generic_dense`:

```
sage: x
(sqrt(2), sqrt(2))
sage: x._rmul_(3)
(3*sqrt(2), 3*sqrt(2))
sage: x.__rmul__(3)
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.

No, it's deeper than that.  __rmul__ should call the right coercion stuff so that _rmul_ is eventually called.  So far, I've traced it down to this:

```
sage: p=x.parent()
sage: p.get_action(3.parent(), operator.mul,False)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

I think I see the problem.  Here is the code in question:

```
        if check:
            V = ambient.ambient_vector_space()
            for i in range(len(basis)):
                x = basis[i]
                if x not in V:
                    try:
                        basis[i] = V(x)
                    except TypeError:
                        raise TypeError("each element of basis must be in "
                                        "the ambient vector space")
```

Notice that a basis element is only converted to V if it's not already in V.  The problem is that the test "x in V" may succeed, even if x is not a vector in V.  In this case, when you try to construct a basis vector for SR<sup>2</sup>, you're handed the vector (1,1) as a rational vector.  The test "x not in V" fails, since the rational vector (1,1) *is* in V.  So it is put in as a basis vector.  You need the initial conversion to first convert vectors to the same type of vectors as live in V, because you need those basis elements to actually be vectors with parent SR<sup>2</sup>.

I.e., we are handed a basis vector in QQ<sup>2</sup>, and we fail to convert it to a vector in SR<sup>2</sup> because the if statement fails:

```
sage: (QQ^2)([1,1]) not in (SR^2)
False
```

The initial conversion using ambient.ambient_vector_space is to ensure that the vectors are actually vectors in SR<sup>2</sup> (in this case).
