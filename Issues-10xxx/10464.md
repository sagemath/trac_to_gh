I think there are a couple of things which will make the ideal `residue_symbol` function a little faster:

1. There should be no need to have the default `check=True` when recursively applying the function to the prime factors of the ideal since all the checks will have already been performed.
2. The final loop can be avoided by calculating a discrete log in the residue field.

Thus I think the last few lines of the definition should read something like:

```
        if not self.is_prime():
            return prod(Q.residue_symbol(e, m, check=False)**i for Q, i in self.factor())
        k = self.residue_field()
        r = k(e)**((k.order() - 1)/m)
        resroot = primroot**(rootorder/m)
        from sage.groups.generic import discrete_log
        j = discrete_log(k(resroot), k(r), ord=m)
        return resroot**j
```
One other little thing.  I think it is safer to write `self.smallest_integer()` rather than `ZZ(self.gens()[0])`.

Please put into the ticket's description which patches to apply [in which order, i.e., in the order they should be applied, and perhaps to which repository].

(The trac wiki syntax for referring to attached files is `[hence in this case `[attachment: trac_10464_residue_symbol.4.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10464/trac_10464_residue_symbol.4.patch.gz)(https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10464/1b1c049e52074327eb485c8b44828146.gz)`.)

Also, using the comment field of attachments isn't bad.
