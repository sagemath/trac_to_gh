Apart from the typo in the commit message, and I'm not sure if I like `assert` there, I'm ok with the patch, and the spkg is clean.

Works for me as advertised, so positive review.

If you mean the spurious apostrophe, I've removed it.

I just took that from #8677.

Oh, I just noticed the patch does *not* (exactly) what the ticket advertises... 
(In fact, the patch addresses the race condition in the creation of the TeX cache.)

There are still some other instances of `if not os.path.exists(foo): mkdir(foo)` and similar, so it's a bit surprising I did not run into any race condition.

John, are you willing to fix these, too?

Unless you meanwhile have Sun's grep installed, you can find them by e.g.

```sh
$ grep -B5 -A2  mkdir `find src -name \*.py`
```
(Giving about two false positives; also not all are equally important I think.)

Attachment: **[trac_10159-matplotlib.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10159/trac_10159-matplotlib.patch.gz)**

Ok.

Also, `raise` is more adequate there, since one cannot assert the only possible `OSError` is `EEXIST`, so it's less confusing now.

(I still can't force errors.)
