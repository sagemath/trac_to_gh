If you mean the spurious apostrophe, I've removed it.

I just took that from #8677.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Oh, I just noticed the patch does *not* (exactly) what the ticket advertises... 
(In fact, the patch addresses the race condition in the creation of the TeX cache.)

There are still some other instances of `if not os.path.exists(foo): mkdir(foo)` and similar, so it's a bit surprising I did not run into any race condition.

John, are you willing to fix these, too?

Unless you meanwhile have Sun's grep installed, you can find them by e.g.

```sh
$ grep -B5 -A2  mkdir `find src -name \*.py`
```
(Giving about two false positives; also not all are equally important I think.)

Ok.

Also, `raise` is more adequate there, since one cannot assert the only possible `OSError` is `EEXIST`, so it's less confusing now.
