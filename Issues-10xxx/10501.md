Matrix methods named `adjoint` and `_adjoint` are renamed `adjugate` and `_adjugate` and replacements are added that raise deprecation warnings.

This is part of the program at #10465.

I already stated some objections to this on the mailing list, but I'll repeat:

On deprecating "adjoint" meaning "matrix of cofactors"
1. it's standard terminology and has meant this in sage for long
2. "adjugate" is newer and (IMO) less standard terminology -- in particular it has no obvious translations

On using "adjoint" meaning "conjugate transpose"
3. "conjugate transpose" is easy to say, and it's really what is meant
4. the "adjoint operator" for a matrix seems ill-defined, because a matrix is not an operator but only a representation of an operator in some basis.

Moreover, if there are two colliding usages of the name "adjoint", I would find it more reasonable to keep the usage that is already traditional in Sage.

The usage of "adjoint" is ubiquitous in relation to quadratic forms afaict (and, as John Cremona pointed out, is where the term originates with Gauss on ternary quadratic forms)

---

Reference for "Adjoint of a matrix":

Bourbaki, Elements, book 2, chapter III, section 11, exercise 9:

  The adjoint of a square matrix X of order n over A is the matrix X = (det (A'")) of minors of A" of order n — 1.

(Note that the term also shows at the index of terminology of the book)

PS: searching for

 "The adjoint of a square matrix" bourbaki

in books.google.com, yields the above passage.

Hi Gonzalo,

+1 from me. I hit this today, and just checked a handful of books:

* Atkinson, An Introduction to Numerical Analysis, 1989. Section 7.1.
* Axler, Linear Algebra Done Right, 1997. Ch. 6.
* Marcus & Minc, Introduction to Linear Algebra, 1988. Section 1.4.
* Meyer, Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra, 2000. Section 3.2.
* Rudin, Functional Analysis, 1991. Chapter 4.
* Shilov, Linear Algebra, 1977. Section 7.6.

All of which use the "new" meaning. In the interest of fairness, I also found,

* Edwards, Elementary Linear Algebra, 2000. Section 3.4.

Which uses the cofactor definition.

Did someone seriously implement `m.conjugate_transpose()` as a shortcut for `m.conjugate().transpose()`? =)

I never thought to look for another method, I just did the operations individually.

From what I understand, the terms "adjoint" and "adjunct" come from higher algebra, most of which is over my head. If that's the case, books written after e.g. category theory became popular will probably gravitate towards the new terminology. Although it does suck to have to deprecate `adjoint`, give it a new name, and then give something else the old name.

Most of us have access to math departments; maybe we could do a survey of people working in linear algebra? If the result is overwhelming, rename it.

Yep, that was me. ;-) But the BDFL suggested it.  Required reading:

You will see a lot of support for changes.  You'll see one conscientious objector.  I dropped it.  If someone else wants to carry the torch, I'll have their back.

It's not as bad as you think, because tab-completion doesn't work on `m.conjugate()`, though it would be awesome if Sage could magically know that...

Rob, so what does the latest version of your book do?

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A8):
> Rob, so what does the latest version of your book do?

conjugate-transpose has always been called "adjoint," in line with my experience teaching numerical linear algebra.  I even have my inner product conjugating the correct vector now.  ;-)

See: http://linear.ups.edu/html/section-MO.html#subsection-AM

I almost never have need to reference the matrix of cofactors (proposed as adjugate here), but do use it one exercise about building a matrix inverse this way.

See:  Exercise PDM.T20 in http://linear.ups.edu/html/section-PDM.html

I want to revive this ticket. So here is the needed patch.

One thing not found in Rob's original patch is alias `adjoint_classical` of `adjugate`. The alias is used in quadratic form code in Sage.

I wholeheartedly agree with "adjugate". When I see "adjoint", I look up the definition. When I see "adjugate", I immediately know what is meant.

Pushed a little commit to improve the documentation. IMHO, this is an easy ticket to review: just run all doctests. If they work, then it's fine.

If klee and darij are both agreed that each other's respective contributions are sufficient, then you can jointly set to positive review (sometimes Authors are 1, 2 and Reviewers are 2, 1).

I do wonder whether some of the py3 things like

```diff
-                raise TypeError("Oops!  The matrix must have " + str(n) + " rows. =(")
+                raise TypeError("the matrix must have {} rows".format(n))
```
are necessary on this ticket, since it makes it a little more of a patch bomb.

Also, don't we typically test deprecations (and then remove when deprecation is done)?

Positive review on his part of the code. It is up to him to put his name to the Author field.

Not necessary. But I think we don't need to freak away from making small improvements unrelated with the main issue of the ticket. Do we?

Or do you regard the small changes as no improvements?

I didn't know. I don't know.

For one of *many* examples, see (at least right now correct link) [this spot](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/tensor/coordinate_patch.py#L58)

```
            sage: x, y, z = var('x, y, z')
