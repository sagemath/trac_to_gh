For some reason Macs and other systems do not agree on the following.  See #10187 for the genesis of this.

Mac:

```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)
log(3)*psi(1, 1/3)
```

Other (at least Linux and some Solaris, I guess):

```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)
psi(1, 1/3)*log(3)
```

I thought it was a Pynac thing, but maybe not:

```
sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('psi(1,1/3)*log(3)')
['GMP']
```

Based on that, putting component 'basic arithmetic', but cc:ing Burcin in case it's Pynac after all.

CC:  @burcin @jpflori

Component: **symbolics**

I'm pretty sure this is a duplicate of #9632. It should be fixed by Jean-Pierre Flori's patch attached to #9880. Unfortunately I am very busy these days and I probably won't have time to review that until January. 

If somebody else can review the changes for pynac, I'd be happy to make a new release with those patches, and a couple of others I've merged from upstream fixes in the meantime.

Thanks, you are almost certainly correct.

I'll try to do this as I have the opportunity over the next week or so.  This is pretty important, in my opinion.  Thanks for noticing this!

As noted by Burcin, it is related to pynac ordering and applying the patch I provided in !#9880 gives me a consistent behavior on Mac and Linux:


```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)
log(3)*psi(1, 1/3)
```

(I order the functions according to their name in lexicographic order)

However !#9880 still needs a lot of work:

- my patch must be reviewed

- pynac must be updated

- a lot of doctests will have to be fixed afterwards
