Some platonic solids in plot/plot3d/platonic.py do not evaluate correctly in the live documentation in the notebook, because they are spread over multiple lines.  Things like 

```
sage: dodecahedron(color='orange', opacity=0.8) + \
      sphere(size=0.5, color='black')
```
become split into the input cell and output cell.

I'm not sure if this is really a notebook bug or a parsing bug when the live documentation is made.  An easy way to fix it is to change the line breaks but that would likely lead to less readability.

Good to go!

About `RR(1)->RR.one()`. I assume that you do this because it is how it is 'advised' as it is apparently faster (I have no first-hand experience on these matters), but I still find `RR(1)` better for the doc since it is more user-friendly.

Well. Matters of taste.

Thanks for this branch,

Nathann
