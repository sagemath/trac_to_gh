<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

After discussion at days27, it seems this is an LLL parameter mismatch:


```
in gp:

? ??qflll
qflll(x,{flag = 0}):

   LLL algorithm applied to the columns of the matrix x.   The columns of x may
be linearly dependent.  The result is a unimodular transformation matrix T such
that  x  .T  is  an  LLL-reduced  basis  of the lattice generated by the column
vectors of x.  Note that if x is not of maximal rank T will not be square.  The
LLL parameters are (0.51,0.99),  meaning that the Gram-Schmidt coefficients for
the  final  basis satisfy mu_{i,j} <= |0.51|,  and the Lov\'{a}sz's constant is
0.99.
```


```
sage: BB.is_LLL_reduced(eta=.51)
True
```

I had a look to this as sage days 84, actually, the LLL option is not passed correctly, according to the doc, this should be passed as a string to the `basis` option, compare (on 7.6.beta5):


```
E=matrix(ZZ, 5, 8,
[5, -23, 21, 77, -50, 8, -76, 16, 2,
-9, 8, 30, -19, 3, -29, 6, 4, -16, 13,
53, -30, 4, -47, 9, 0, 5, -14, -24,
33, -5, 47, -14, -2, 11, -9, -35, 23,
-5, 34, -7])
KK=E.right_kernel(LLL=True)
BB=KK.basis_matrix().change_ring(ZZ)
BB.is_LLL_reduced()
False
```

with 

```
E=matrix(ZZ, 5, 8,
[5, -23, 21, 77, -50, 8, -76, 16, 2,
-9, 8, 30, -19, 3, -29, 6, 4, -16, 13,
53, -30, 4, -47, 9, 0, 5, -14, -24,
33, -5, 47, -14, -2, 11, -9, -35, 23,
-5, 34, -7])
KK=E.right_kernel(basis='LLL')
BB=KK.basis_matrix().change_ring(ZZ)
BB.is_LLL_reduced()
True
```

Hence, i suggest to close this ticket as wontfix.
