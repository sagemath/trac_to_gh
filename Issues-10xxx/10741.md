The code implementing the matrix_action_right() and matrix_action_left() is wrong.

As an example, for right actions, associativity does not hold:

```
sage: M=Matrix(ZZ,2,2,[1,-1,0,1])
sage: N=Matrix(ZZ,2,2,[0,1,-1,0])
sage: Q=BinaryQF(5,7,1)
sage: Q.matrix_action_right(M).matrix_action_right(N)
x^2 - 5*x*y - y^2
sage: Q.matrix_action_right(M*N)
13*x^2 - 17*x*y + 5*y^2
```
While the doc strings describe, in each case, the correct formulae, the code is "backwards": the left action should use the rows; the right action should use the columns.
