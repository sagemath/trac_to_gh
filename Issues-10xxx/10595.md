IMHO, if this "feature" is limited to complex numbers only, it better be eradicated. It should be easy to track down and fix the library code that uses it.

I agree - in principle.  But I also have my hands full with some other changes in behavior.  ;-)

I'll do some tests soon to gauge the magnitude of the chore and we can go from there.

Here's the extent of converting complex numbers to vectors via the vector() constructor.  Of course many of the failures are consequences of some earlier failure.

how about the following:

make vector(blah) check whether blah.vector() can be called, and call it, if it is there.

add vector() member function to the corresponding complex number class.
