IMHO, if this "feature" is limited to complex numbers only, it better be eradicated. It should be easy to track down and fix the library code that uses it.

I agree - in principle.  But I also have my hands full with some other changes in behavior.  ;-)

I'll do some tests soon to gauge the magnitude of the chore and we can go from there.

how about the following:

make vector(blah) check whether blah.vector() can be called, and call it, if it is there.

add vector() member function to the corresponding complex number class.
