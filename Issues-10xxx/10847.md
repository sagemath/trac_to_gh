This is such a great patch, really nicely put together and documented, everything.  I really want to say positive review, except plotting sparse matrices now does not work.

```
sage: sparse = matrix(dict([((randint(0, 10), randint(0, 10)), 1) for i in xrange(100)])); matrix_plot(sparse)
<snip>
AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions
```

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A3):
> AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions

Matrices have a *function* subdivision() and an *attribute* subdivisions.

```
sage: A= matrix(2, range(4))
sage: type(A.subdivision)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
sage: type(A.subdivisions)
<type 'NoneType'>
```

The latter should go away, see #4983.  Maybe it is not visible outside of a *.pyx file?

Anyway, hope this helps some.
