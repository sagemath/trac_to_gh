I think this is ready for review.  I was trying to create a graph like in the Wikipedia page on DCT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dctjpeg.png), but we didn't support plotting matrix subdivisions and adding lines to a matrix plot was messing it up.

Well, it all works beautifully now, after this patch! :).

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A3):
> AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions


Matrices have a *function* subdivision() and an *attribute* subdivisions.

```
sage: A= matrix(2, range(4))
sage: type(A.subdivision)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
sage: type(A.subdivisions)
<type 'NoneType'>
```

The latter should go away, see #4983.  Maybe it is not visible outside of a *.pyx file?

Anyway, hope this helps some.
