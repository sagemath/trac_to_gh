> AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions


Matrices have a *function* subdivision() and an *attribute* subdivisions.

```
sage: A= matrix(2, range(4))
sage: type(A.subdivision)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
sage: type(A.subdivisions)
<type 'NoneType'>
```

The latter should go away, see #4983.  Maybe it is not visible outside of a *.pyx file?

Anyway, hope this helps some.

#4983, as of about mid-day yesterday, said

```
Here's patch. This keeps get_subdivisions as a synonym for subdivisions.
