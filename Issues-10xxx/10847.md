I think this is ready for review.  I was trying to create a graph like in the Wikipedia page on DCT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dctjpeg.png), but we didn't support plotting matrix subdivisions and adding lines to a matrix plot was messing it up.

Well, it all works beautifully now, after this patch! :).

This is such a great patch, really nicely put together and documented, everything.  I really want to say positive review, except plotting sparse matrices now does not work.

```
sage: sparse = matrix(dict([((randint(0, 10), randint(0, 10)), 1) for i in xrange(100)])); matrix_plot(sparse)

AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A3):
> AttributeError: Unknown property subdivisions

Matrices have a *function* subdivision() and an *attribute* subdivisions.

```
sage: A= matrix(2, range(4))
sage: type(A.subdivision)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
sage: type(A.subdivisions)
<type 'NoneType'>
```

The latter should go away, see #4983.  Maybe it is not visible outside of a *.pyx file?

Anyway, hope this helps some.

**Attachment:** [trac_10847-4983-fix.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10847/trac_10847-4983-fix.patch.gz)

I think this patch should fix any incompatibilities with #4983.  With this, you can apply the patches here independently of #4983.
