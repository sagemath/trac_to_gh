```
Using the `@parallel` decorator on a function, the Gap instances in the different branches of the function should have distinct files for I/O.

Indeed, under normal circumstances, they are distinct:

```
sage: @parallel
....: def f(n):
....:     return gap._local_tmpfile()
....:
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it should be
5
```

However, it suffices to call `gap._local_tmpfile()` in the main sage branch in order to break diversity:

```
sage: print gap._local_tmpfile()
/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/16041//interface//tmp16041
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it must not be
1
```

The reason for this behaviour lies in the `quit()` method of Expect interfaces: If `_local_tmpfile()` is called then the resulting name is stored in `__local_tmpfile`. The `@parallel` decorator needs the interfaces in a clean state, so, it calls `quit()`. However, quit does not unset `__local_tmpfile`, and thus all interface instances in the different branches of the parallel computation will use the same previously stored file name.

The consequences are obvious: Having different processes use the same file for passing command lines must end in a disaster.

I hope it is OK to mark this as blocker. After all, parallelisation and interfaces are both important.

Meanwhile, it seems to me that the problem is ultimately caused by setattr/getattr. 

I work with the definition

```
    def _local_tmpfile(self):
        try:
            return self.__local_tmpfile
        except AttributeError:
            self.__local_tmpfile = '%s/tmp'%SAGE_TMP_INTERFACE + str(self.pid())
            return self.__local_tmpfile
```

The following is rather irritating:

1. The attribute !__local_tmpfile can be accessed from within the method, but not from outside.

```
sage: gap._local_tmpfile() is gap._local_tmpfile()
True
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError:
```

2. When setting the attribute !__local_tmpfile from outside, it can not be retrieved from inside the _local_tmpfile method:

```
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile = 'foobar'
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/21283//interface//tmp21285'
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
'foobar'
```

Now it seems to work! With the patch, I get

1. Caching works

```
  sage: gap._local_tmpfile() is gap._local_tmpfile()
  True
```

2. Different interfaces have different tmpfiles:

```
  sage: gap._local_tmpfile() != singular._local_tmpfile()
  True
```

3. Parallelisation works:

```
  sage: @parallel
  ....: def f(n):
  ....:     return gap._local_tmpfile()
  ....:
  sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
  sage: len(set(L))
  5
  sage: print gap._local_tmpfile()
  /home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/24281//interface//tmp24283
  sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
  sage: len(set(L))
  5 
```

The ideas for my patch are:

1. As before, the name of the file is cached in an attribute !__local_tmpfile.

2. If !__local_tmpfile is not there or is None, then a new filename is created, which depends on pid(). This is different for different interface instances, including different forks of a parallelised function.

3. It must be ensured that the cache is emptied before forking. This is implemented in `Expect.quit()`: !__local_tmpfile is set to None (I tested that !__delattr!__ did not do the job).

I think this is because of Python's [name-mangling](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables):

```python
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/scratch/mpatel/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/28400//interface//tmp28400'
sage: gap._Expect__local_tmpfile
'/scratch/mpatel/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/28400//interface//tmp28400'

Thank you! I did not know about this.

Do you think that in the `quit()` method I should now do

```
self.__delattr__('_Expect__local_tmpfile')
```
instead of 

```
self.__local_tmpfile=None
```
?

Or is testing

```
self.__local_tmpfile is None
```
quick enough, so that the patch can stay as it is?

So, now that you taught me how to deal with the double underscore attribute, I'll try to change my patch accordingly.\n\n\nI apologize for not being clear.  I just meant there's a tradeoff in which method (`quit` or `_local_tmpfile`) might have to do more work.  Does one typically get called much more often than the other?  There may be a small performance penalty in using `try-except` vs. `hasattr` vs. `None`.

I apologize for not being clear.  I just meant there's a tradeoff in which method (`quit` or `_local_tmpfile`) might have to do more work.  Does one typically get called much more often than the other?  There may be a small performance penalty in using `try-except` vs. `hasattr` vs. `None`.  But this probably only matters if we're making **many** calls to the methods.

The patch looks good and I'll try to review it soon, if someone else doesn't do it first.

Thanks!  I wasn't aware of the `quit` call in `parallel` (or `use_fork`) itself.
