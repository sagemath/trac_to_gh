```
Using the `@parallel` decorator on a function, the Gap instances in the different branches of the function should have distinct files for I/O.

Indeed, under normal circumstances, they are distinct:

```
sage: @parallel
....: def f(n):
....:     return gap._local_tmpfile()
....:
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it should be
5
```

However, it suffices to call `gap._local_tmpfile()` in the main sage branch in order to break diversity:

```
sage: print gap._local_tmpfile()
/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/16041//interface//tmp16041
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it must not be
1
```

The reason for this behaviour lies in the `quit()` method of Expect interfaces: If `_local_tmpfile()` is called then the resulting name is stored in `__local_tmpfile`. The `@parallel` decorator needs the interfaces in a clean state, so, it calls `quit()`. However, quit does not unset `__local_tmpfile`, and thus all interface instances in the different branches of the parallel computation will use the same previously stored file name.

The consequences are obvious: Having different processes use the same file for passing command lines must end in a disaster.

I hope it is OK to mark this as blocker. After all, parallelisation and interfaces are both important.

Meanwhile, it seems to me that the problem is ultimately caused by setattr/getattr. 

I work with the definition

```
    def _local_tmpfile(self):
        try:
            return self.__local_tmpfile
        except AttributeError:
            self.__local_tmpfile = '%s/tmp'%SAGE_TMP_INTERFACE + str(self.pid())
            return self.__local_tmpfile
```

The following is rather irritating:

1. The attribute !__local_tmpfile can be accessed from within the method, but not from outside.

```
sage: gap._local_tmpfile() is gap._local_tmpfile()
True
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError:
```

2. When setting the attribute !__local_tmpfile from outside, it can not be retrieved from inside the _local_tmpfile method:

```
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile = 'foobar'
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/21283//interface//tmp21285'
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
'foobar'

I think this is because of Python's [name-mangling](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables):

```python
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/scratch/mpatel/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/28400//interface//tmp28400'
sage: gap._Expect__local_tmpfile

Thank you! I did not know about this.

Do you think that in the `quit()` method I should now do

```
self.__delattr__('_Expect__local_tmpfile')
```
instead of 

```
self.__local_tmpfile=None
```
?

Or is testing

```
self.__local_tmpfile is None
```
quick enough, so that the patch can stay as it is?

That was my question: Is there a tradeoff? So, now that you taught me how to deal with the double underscore attribute, I'll try to change my patch accordingly.

OK, done. `quit` is called in `@parallel`, because that decorator needs to wipe all interfaces -- but it was not rigorous enough, as it did not unset the name of the temporary file.

+The reason for this behaviour lies in the `quit()` method of Expect interfaces: If `_local_tmpfile()` is called then the resulting name is stored in `__local_tmpfile`. The `@parallel` decorator needs the interfaces in a clean state, so, it calls `quit()`. However, quit does not unset `__local_tmpfile`, and thus all interface instances in the different branches of the parallel computation will use the same previously stored file name.

 I hope it is OK to mark this as blocker. After all, parallelisation and interfaces are both important.

I apologize for not being clear.  I just meant there's a tradeoff in which method (`quit` or `_local_tmpfile`) might have to do more work.  Does one typically get called much more often than the other?  There may be a small performance penalty in using `try-except` vs. `hasattr` vs. `None`.  But this probably only matters if we're making **many** calls to the methods.

The patch looks good and I'll try to review it soon, if someone else doesn't do it first.

Thanks!  I wasn't aware of the `quit` call in `parallel` (or `use_fork`) itself.
