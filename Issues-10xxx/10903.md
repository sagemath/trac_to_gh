# Singular spkg upgrade

Singular 3-1-2 fixes a critical bug, cf. #10902. There are more bugfixes in the newest stable release. We should update as soon as possible.

# Sage libsingular upgrade

There are various issues where `currRing` is not correctly set. Some of these are triggered by refcounting the rings and freeing them when they are no longer needed, see the dependency ticket #11339.

FWIW, the Singular spkg from #11550 will probably become a p12, since #11663 meanwhile provides a p11 (which Karl-Dieter's will have to get rebased on again).

I'll then perhaps provide a p13 based on that fixing #11645. :)

Anyway, I guess upgrading Sage's Singular will be attempted during the [Sage/Singular Days in Kaiserslautern](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cca0edad4b6a41aa/1f872997a159304e) at the end of September, so we have some time until then...

The spkg name should contain the svn version you are using.




Regarding the patch to `module_list.py`:

Please don't randomly add all libraries any extension module using Singular might also use to `singular_libs`.

now I managed to compile the Singular spkg, but when starting Sage I get:

```

    513     if m.integral_domain.is_IntegralDomain(base_ring):

Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.

Should I have imported first the two patches?

{

<a id='comment:42'></a>
The rules for using/setting `currRing` when calling libSingular are:

* The Sage library Python code should never make any assumptions about `currRing`.
* `currRing` can only be assumed to stay defined within pure C/Cython code.

This is particularly important because the garbage collector can run between any two Python instructions, but not within C/Cython!

In order to identify code where we forget to set `currRing`, I implemented a function `poison_currRing()` in `sage.libs.singular.singular` that will set `currRing` to NULL, triggering a segfault if we forget to set it back to a meaningful value before calling libSingular. Using the Python debugger hook, this function can be called between each Python command (but not within Cython code). 

It can be globally enabled by uncommenting the lines

```
### Debugging for Singular, see trac #10903
from sage.libs.singular.ring import poison_currRing
sys.settrace(poison_currRing)
```
at the very end of `sage/all.py`.

Using this code, I identified and fixed various places in the Sage library of the form

```python
  rChangeCurrRing(_ring)
  self.parent().some_python_method()
  libSingular_func()
```
Note that calling some python method in-between exits Cython and allows Python to run the garbage collector etc! Not only do you exit Cython when you return from your Cython function, but also if you call Python in-between.

I also ran into an issue where code uses iteritems() to iterate over `locals()`, `globals()`, or dictionaries returned by `gc.get_referrers()`. This can potentially raise a `RuntimeError` if those dictionaries change during the iteration. Hooking into the python debugger loop is a good way of triggering precisely that. This also happens in the `PolyBoRi` Python interface, this is now fixed upstream at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3416946&group_id=210499&atid=1013986

With the attached patch, I can run the whole Sage testsuite without errors while continuosly poisoning `currRing`. If you do not patch `PolyBoRi`, you get some otherwise harmless errors from it but no segfaults. Note that the patch does not enable the poisoning by default. I am quite sure that the patch fixes all remaining Sage/Singular segfault issues. Please give it a try!

I'm against bikeshedding `module_list.py` any further. The next version of Singular will split into multiple libraries and any effort trying to minimize the number of linked libraries now is going to be wasted.

As far as naming goes, Martin called the patch 3-1-4 before we knew that the next version would be 3-1-3-3. He should rename the path when he gets back on Monday but thats just a trivial change. I reviewed his patch and hereby give it positive review.

The `-ldl` issue #11769 is fixed.

All we need for this ticket is
* review my patch
* check that the spkg builds on OSX and Solaris

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A46):
> I'm against bikeshedding `module_list.py` any further.

Well, I'd be happy if it just kept the color it had (more precisely, the different modules kept their different colors); what Martin did is just literally painting them all black, or brown, by mixing all the colors at least one of them had.

What would you say if I changed the libraries in all linker commands to just use `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/*.so`?

This is a useless regression, although it seems the patch has meanwhile changed, and the changes are less poor now.

If you want to "simplify" `module_list.py` by factoring out the libraries **Singular** (i.e. `libsingular`) requires, as he probably intended, then put **these** libraries into `singular_libs`, and nothing else.




> The next version of Singular will split into multiple libraries and any effort trying to minimize the number of linked libraries now is going to be wasted.

That's totally unrelated.

I found that the problem occurs for some `<sage.misc.misc.DeprecatedFunctionAlias object at 0x1e2fc10>`, which in fact wraps `<method 'is_constant' of 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' objects>`

But that's very strange, because I get

```
sage: x.is_constant.__name__
'is_constant'
```

Aha! Perhaps the problem arose like here:

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import deprecated_function_alias
sage: print deprecated_function_alias(x.is_constant, "bla").__name__
None
```

And I think I have located the problem: [attachment:trac_10903_singular-fixes.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10903/trac_10903_singular-fixes.patch) introduces a change in `sage/misc/misc.py`, and apparently it can happen that the lazy attribute `__name__` of `DeprecatedFunctionAlias` returns None.

Perhaps it would be a solution to return `self.func.__name__`, if no name can be determined by using `inspect.stack` and `gc.get_referrers`?

```
sage: print x._is_constant.__name__

```

`_is_constant` is a deprecated alias for `is_constant`. I think it would be a bad idea to use the name `"is_constant"` for `_is_constant` (note the underscores), because otherwise the docbuilder might think that the deprecated function has to be documented.

Perhaps the easiest solution is to make the lazy attribute `__name__` raise an `AttributeError`, rather than returning `None`. That would certainly make the docbuilder happy, because it tests `if hasattr(obj,'__name__') and obj.__name__.find('.') != -1 and obj.__name__.split('.')[-1] != name): ..."`.

The bug is that `x._is_constant` is a lazy attribute in a Cython class, and I only tested for Python classes. I've patched this issue and will upload the fix as soon as doctests finish (and this time I'm deleting doc/output so the whole documentation will be rebuilt).

The docbuilder currently documents deprecated functions and I think thats a good idea; Say, somebody suddenly gets a deprecation warning and then looks into the developer guide.

Of course `x._is_constant` is always excluded from the documentation because of the underscore, before and after deprecation. This lack of documentation is precisely the reason why I renamed it to `x.is_constant` and deprecated the underscore method...

But I take it with your patch the deprecated functions (without underscore) from Cython classes aren't documented any more. For example, see `doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/symbolic/expression.html#sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.lgamma` --- this is currently documented and I'd like to keep it that way until we remove it altogether.

No, you are mistaken. I've built the documentation, and lgamma is in.

In fact, the documentation is misformatted, it looks like

```
    This method is deprecated, please use the .log_gamma() function instead.

    Log gamma function evaluated at self.

    EXAMPLES::
        sage: x.lgamma() doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: The lgamma() function is deprecated. Use log_gamma() instead. log_gamma(x)

```
where actually `.log_gamma()` is TeXed. So, while we are at it, we may fix the docstring of lgamma.

Sorry, I forgot to post before leaving office: Your patch manages to deduce the name of a deprecated Cython method. That certainly fixes the problem with the docs. With the patches applied as you stated it in the modified ticket description, both the doc tests and the references are fine.

```

It used to need about **1.2GB** virtual memory, with the new Singular it needs **3.0GB**.  I measured this by setting `ulimit -v` and checking whether the test succeeds, for example:

```
### The parentheses start a subshell such that the ulimit only affects

I don't know whether this issue is upstream or caused by some of the Sage library patches, but it is certainly serious enough not to merge this ticket.

As a reference: before this ticket, every test passed with 2.2GB of RAM, with the most memory used by

Working at #11900, I observe that I get a very massive regression with #10903:

```
sage: %time for E in cremona_curves([11..100]): S = E.integral_points(both_signs=False)
CPU times: user 54.17 s, sys: 0.49 s, total: 54.66 s
Wall time: 55.38 s
```

With sage-4.7.2.alpha2 plus #9138 (which causes some regression in other examples), the example only takes 16.48 s, and with #11900 it reduces to 13.22 s.

I am not totally sure that #11339/#10903 are really to blame for it, but it is at least possible.

FWIW, it builds on Linux PPC64 (POWER7, SLES 11, GCC 4.4.6), but it currently seems I get more doctest failures than before, i.e. Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 without #11339, the patches from here and the new spkg.

Have to investigate that further.

```
 * Exit when `patch` fails.  We do not print an error message, patch is 
   verbose enough by itself.
```

Not true. `patch`'s error messages do not start with `Error` nor `Failed`, such that it's hard to find out which spkg actually failed to build / install in parallel builds.

If you don't want to apply the patches in a loop (prepending numbers to [some of] the patches could force the proper order), you should use something like

```sh
patch_error()
{
    echo >&2 "Error: Patch failed to apply."
    exit 1
}

...

    patch -p1 < ... || patch_error

...
```
or use the weirdly-named `success()` function.

It's not that easy: OS X question does not define `__ELF__`, because it's MACH, not an ELF. Singular just needs an ELF-compatible dlopen here. (So maybe `HAVE_ELF_SYSTEM` is a misleading macro name.

What do you mean with this?  How is the message

```
Error: Patch failed to apply.
```
more clear than something like

```
1 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx.rej
```
In any case, I don't see what this has to do with parallel builds.

Can anybody tell me how we should proceed?

Error: Patch failed to apply.
```

1 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx.rej
```

It isn't more clear (the "Error: ..." would be printed *in addition* anyway, although an "ordinary" user would perhaps not know what a hunk is or the message is all about), but you can easily grep for it, so *every* error message should start with "Failed" or (preferably) "Error".

(Volker, btw., the new ATLAS spkg is an IMHO poor counterexample to that, as it raises unhandled exceptions such that one gets tracebacks instead of meaningful error messages.)

The Sage library, which is built in parallel *by default*, is also a bad exception to this; it's often hard to see what really failed, not to mention the odd warnings about `-Wstrict-prototypes` not being valid for C++.




> In any case, I don't see what this has to do with parallel builds.

Well, the screen output (and hence `install.log`) is pretty messed up in parallel builds, and `make` usually doesn't stop immediately if one spkg fails to build, but continues and waits for other jobs to finish. [Another issue is that `stdout` and `stderr` frequently get "out of sync".]

To see what went wrong or which spkgs failed to build / didn't pass the (self-)test suite, one can usually do

```sh
$ egrep '^(Error|Failed) ' spkg/logs/*
```
with variations on `-i`, `-h`, `-n` and `-A/B/C...` etc.

It wouldn't be bad to add something similar to the top-level `Makefile`; since we always *append* to the logs, we could create a fresh temporary log file upon every build and let `sage-spkg` write to it whenever a build or running `spkg-check` failed, such that an informative summary can be printed at the end, at least on errors. (We could also log the so far successfully built spkgs somewhere, such that one can `tail -f` that file, perhaps even with timings or date/time, "i/N spkgs built".)




> Can anybody tell me how we should proceed?

Well, it's a minor issue of course.  But we should IMHO avoid such in the future.


I still cannot really tell whether this spkg (along with the patches) causes *more* doctests to fail on Linux PPC64 (the Skynet machine Silius; SLES 11.1, POWER7), since I've experimented with various things on that machine, and I haven't yet had the time to reliably compare builds which really only differ w.r.t. this ticket (and #11339).

In case this ticket should cause more problems on that platform, we could (hopefully) fix these on a follow-up, since there are other spkgs which apparently are still broken on it (also depending on the compiler version and options), so building Sage there is currently pretty experimental anyway.

But every failed spkg also prints the message

```
sage: An error occurred while installing mpir-2.1.3.p5
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /home/buildbot/build/sage/iras-1/iras_full/build/sage-4.7.2.alpha4/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/home/buildbot/build/sage/iras-1/iras_full/build/sage-4.7.2.alpha4/spkg/build/mpir-2.1.3.p5 and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/home/buildbot/build/sage/iras-1/iras_full/build/sage-4.7.2.alpha4/spkg/build/mpir-2.1.3.p5' && '/home/buildbot/build/sage/iras-1/iras_full/build/sage-4.7.2.alpha4/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.
```

One can easily `grep` for this to find out which package caused the problem and then look at `spkg/logs/$PACKAGENAME.log`.

Looks better.

Btw., I sometimes also grep for `"An error"`.  Grepping for `"^(Error|Failed) "` (perhaps with context, which doesn't make much sense in the former case) immediately shows you *what* went wrong.  Of course the logs of spkgs that are themselves built in parallel are sometimes harder to read.

trac_10903_singular-fixes.patch seems to remove the functionality of the parameter omit_underscore_names in sageinspect.py's sage_getvariablename(). Was that done on purpose?
