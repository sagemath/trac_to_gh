Note the traceback:

```

/Users/wstein/sd27/sage-4.6.1.rc1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in __factor_using_pari(n, int_, debug_level, proof)
   2140         pari.set_debug_level(debug_level)
   2141         
-> 2142     F = pari(n).factor(proof=proof)
   2143     B = F[0]
   2144     e = F[1]

...
```

so it is factoring.

Looking briefly over this, it's not surprising that it's factoring:

```
sage: (2^6 * 7^6)^(1/3)
196
sage: parent(_)
Rational Field
sage: (2^6 * 7^5)^(1/3)
28*49^(1/3)
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
```
So we need to factor to decide if the result is in the rationals or not.

Can someone explain this further? I mean technically, factoring is overkill for this---if the exponent is a rational `a/b` then it suffices to check if the base is a b-th power, doesn't it?
