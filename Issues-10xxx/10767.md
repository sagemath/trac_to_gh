Here is an explicit example:

```
sage: var('x') 
sage: K=QQ.extension(x,'x') 
sage: (K*(1/4)).intersection(K*(1/4)) 
Fractional ideal (1/16) 
```

Apply [attachment:10767_doctest.patch] to the Sage library.

(The issue is fixed by #11130, upgrading PARI, but the patch adds a corresponding doctest, so this ticket is **not** a duplicate.)
