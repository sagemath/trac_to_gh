```
IPython's magic functions, when not escaped by %, are preparsed by Sage as variables. For example, with implicit multiplication turned on:

```
sage: cd Desktop/          
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     cd*Desktop/
                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This patch adds the IPython magic functions as keywords, and fixes this problem.

Hmm... I'm not so sure "r" should be included in this, as it's more likely to be used as a variable. Also, this doesn't handle

```
sage: ls /path/with/number/100
sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
sh: -c: line 0: `ls -F /path/with/number/Integer(100)'
```

I would rather something that looks at the first "word" to see if it's a iPython magic function and doesn't preparse at all in that case.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Clearing milestone since I don't know when this will be fixed, or if anyone wants to tackle it, but it is still buggy.  E.g. this works no problem:

```
sage: mkdir abc
sage: ls -ld abc
drwxr-xr-x+ 1 Erik M. Bray 0 Aug 14 19:37 abc/
```

But this is broken:

```
sage: mkdir 100
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
/bin/bash: -c: line 0: `mkdir Integer(100)'
```

I don't know how difficult this would be to fix, but the Sage REPL should probably talk to IPython's parser to find out when a line of input would be processed as a command-line command and *not* run the Sage preparser on it.
