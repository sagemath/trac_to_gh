```
Presently, ecllib does not enable signals when executing ecl code. This makes LISP code uninterruptable:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: ecl_eval("(setf i 0)")
<ECL: 0>
sage: inf_loop=ecl_eval("(defun infinite() (loop (incf i)))")
sage: inf_loop() #DON'T DO THIS! (bye bye)
```
The signal handling in ECL should be studied a bit more to ensure that we are safely interacting with it.

When testing this patch, absolutely test it to **sage-4.7.alpha1 or later** since ECL was updated (#10766) and interrupts were completely rewritten (#9678).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Apply handlerswap.p2.patch

Another take on swapping handlers and this one seems to work:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima as max
sage: max('sum(1/x^2, x, 1, 100000)')
^C---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
TypeError: ECL says: Console interrupt
sage: #we press Ctrl-C again
KeyboardInterrupt
```
For reference, ECL prefers to use sigaction (in fact, probably sage should be using sigaction as well. Certain race conditions with signal are avoidable with sigaction). In glibc, signal is implemented via sigaction anyway. sigaction has a richer interface, so signal cannot always properly report what sigaction has done. By using sigaction to record and swap the different SIGINT handlers, it seems to work.

Subtle race conditions still exist: the ECL handler is instated just before entering lisp code and setting up the "unwind-protect stack frame", so an interrupt that gets delivered in that window would cause unspecified behaviour. By running

while True: os.kill(<PID>,2)

it is easy to trigger such behaviour, but sage in its present state already cannot handle this.
Therefore, I think the present patch establishes acceptable "best effort" behaviour.

Small update:
* Juanjo explains that unwelcome signals in ECL get queued. To mark this fact, a memory block gets mprotected to readonly. The next time a write occurs, a SIGSEGV is received and the queued signal is processed if it is now safe to do so. This means, however, that if ECL is allowed to process *any* signals then it should be allowed to handle SIGSEGV. So that handler needs to be swapped as well.
* constants SIGINT and SIGSEGV are now actually imported.

Race conditions still exist. If you run a sage process with pid PID with something along the lines of

```
from sage.libs.ecl import *
lp = ecl_eval("(defun lp (a) (loop))")
while True:
    try:
        lp(1)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print e
```
and then run in another process:

```
while True:
    os.kill(PID,2)
    sleep(0.01)
```
you may eventually see strange behaviour. To avoid this we could disable signals prior to swapping the handlers and only enable them once we're inside lisp (and do the reverse on the way out). However, the signal handlers in sage are already not completely bullet proof (I don't think there are many programs where they are). Improvements welcome of course, but I think the present gives a workable compromise.

I don't know if maxima is robust in the face of interrupts, but we're already exposed to that by letting pexpect propagate SIGINT.

As far as I know, the present patch does not contribute to possible corruption of ECL. You might end up in the ECL debugger if the interrupt arrives between teardown of the Lisp version of try/expect and the swap of the interrupt handlers. This is easily distinguished from a wrong answer.

See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27127709 for JJ G-P's suggestion for dealing with this.

<a id='comment:20'></a>I've looked through the code and (after understanding lots of things about signal handling in Sage) it seems great.

I would be ready to give it positive review if the test_sigint_... was a little bit more explicit.

Right now, letting sig_on(), sig_off() in ecl_sig_on() and ecl_sig_off() does not look really different (ok, there is one line more).

For example adding an infinite loop between ecl_sig_on and ecl_sig_off:

```
    global safe_funcall_clobj
    cl_eval(string_to_object("(setf i 0)"))
    cl_eval(string_to_object("(defun infinite() (loop (incf i)))"))
    inf_loop=cl_eval(string_to_object("(symbol-function 'infinite)"))
    signal_raise(SIGINT)
    ecl_sig_on() # KeyboardInterrupt should be raised because ecl_sig_on() calls sig_on() first
    cl_funcall(1,inf_loop)
    ecl_sig_off()
```

Of course because you will actually leave "sig_on()" in "ecl_sig_on()", that won't cause any problems, but if we were to leave out "sig_on()"  we won't see "Failure" printed (the SIGINT will get caught before, and that is the main reason which makes it a bad test for me) and that will completely break interrupt handling (pressing Ctrl-C afterwards will lead you into Lisp debugger, I don't even know how to get out of there without pressing Ctrl+\).

So you could just add a line stating that even with sig_on(), "Failure !" will not be printed, or a little explanatory paragraph in a note rather than just comments inside sage code.

Would it be at all possible to have the output of

```
sage -t -long -verbose -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/ecl.pyx
```
