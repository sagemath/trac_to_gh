Hi Mitesh,

I didn't had the time to work on it (and even more generally on sage) recently. My previous attempt goes back to July with version 1.0.1 and showed some difficult hard stuff but Sphinx itself seemed to bu the cause. This is very cool if they are solved with 1.0.4. There is a chance that I can find some time in the next two weeks. However, if Francois beat me, I won't complain :-)
The broken tests seem so be very easy to solve. My plan is then to solve #9128 (Sphinx should be aware of all.py to find its links).

Well the situation for me is that on sage-on-gentoo we use system packages. And sphinx 1.0.4 has been marked stable so all sage-on-gentoo users were automatically updated to it. We test a number of things that way, if there is a real problem we pin sage to use a particular version.

I won't beat you to it, it's kind of crunch time here (the semester and the year is ending in New Zealand with all that implies in terms of marking).

What the above tests mean is that the HTML documentation can be built without a LaTeX installation, but the resulting documentation would not render LaTeX typeset math expressions. For best result, you should install a LaTeX distribution on your system before building the Sage documentation. Of course, when you compile Sage, the configure script that is first run does warn about having a LaTeX installation if your system doesn't already have a LaTeX installation.

If possible, I would like to see
* See the resulting HTML of a Sphinx run without LaTeX.
* The log file of running Sphinx without LaTeX.

Would it make sense for `make doc-html` to first test whether `latex` is installed?  If there is no `latex`, give an error and don't build the documentation.

The patches look okay to me, but I've only glanced at them.  However, I don't see why the various .py files in the patches directory are in .hgignore.  I don't think this is the usual practice for spkgs.

I agree that this is not the usual practice, but maybe we should make it usual practice?

So it seems that the new Sphinx needs a more recent LaTeX installation with `utf8x.def`.

Hmm, sphinx-0.6.3 uses

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
```
which works with that particular tetex installation.

sphinx-1.0.4 uses

```
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}

According to [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1797841/icelandic-utf8-and-utf8x-in-latex), 

```
utf8 is "supported" by the LaTeX team and covers a fairly specific/limited range 
of unicode input characters. It only defines those symbols that are known to be 
available with the current font encoding.

utf8x, AFAIK, is no longer supported, but covers a much broader range of input 
symbols. I would recommend only trying it if utf8 doesn't do what you need.
```
We also discussed this for Sage at #8036.  In fact, is the difference really in Sphinx 1.0.4?  In SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py, we have the line

```
latex_elements['inputenc'] = '\\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'
```
added by #8036.  I wonder why this doesn't cause you problems on that particular linux system.

Here are some trivial problems in the file `SPKG.txt` of version ".p3" of the Sphinx package:

* In the section

```
== Dependencies ==

This depends on Jinja >= 2, Pygments >= 0.8, and docutils >= 0.4.
```
 we should have "Pygments >= 1.3.1" due to ticket #10290. But this is no biggy; it's a trivial typo that can either (i) be fixed in a new ticket, or (ii) fixed in the current ticket.

* In the section

```
* patches/pngmath.patch: This replaces \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
  by \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} in the LaTeX preamble for building
  images in the HTML documentation.  This change is done because some
  LaTeX installations have only utf8, not utf8x (utf8x adds support for
  much more Unicode characters, but these are needed used to typeset the
  mathematics in the Sage documentation).
```
 the fragment

 ```
 but these are needed used to typeset the
 ```
 should be changed to

 ```
 but these are used to typeset the
 ```

Tested on the following platforms:

* {sage.math, bsd.math, hawk}: Both HTML and PDF versions of documentation built OK. For the PDF version, building the reference manual produced some warnings about "unusable reference target", which are to do with relative links to other documents in the Sage standard documentation.

* {cleo, iras}.skynet: Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 fails to build on this machine, hence the documentation doesn't get built at all.
 
* {cicero, eno, lena, sextus, taurus, t2}: The HTML version of the documentation mostly built OK, but with warnings about a missing LaTeX installation. Consequently, the PDF version of the documentation can't be built.

Regarding the last patch (trac-10118_use-utf8.patch):

- this is a bit of a regression: see #8036.  Right now, the problematic string from that ticket is not in the reference manual, but if the file schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py is added to the reference manual, then the pdf documentation won't build.

- with this patch, I think that fr/tutorial doesn't build in pdf format.  Could someone else please check this?

- by default, Sphinx uses utf8, so if this patch worked, I think you could actually just comment out the line (in conf.py)

```
latex_elements['inputenc'] = '\\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'
```
 rather than replace `utf8x` with `utf8`.
