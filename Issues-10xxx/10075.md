Currently, there is no way to send `log_gamma` to Maxima, for instance.  This can be fixed by following the models in the functions/ directory; it should be possible to make it a GinacFunction.  Before doing so, though, one will have to resolve #10072, since the evaluation will be wrong (?) otherwise.

Burcin points out that 

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1) 
NaN
```
is not good.  Sage itself does

```
sage: log(gamma(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
```
but Wolfram Alpha says

```
1.53171... - 9.42478... i
```
so the branches seem to differ even there.

Since #9130 has positive review:  Apply only [attachment: trac_10075_log_gamma_without_functions.rst.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10075/trac_10075_log_gamma_without_functions.rst.patch.gz).

One might think that Burcin's comment about `-2.1` makes this 'needs work', but that is actually the current Sage behavior as well, so in principle that would be a different ticket, since making `log_gamma` symbolic would not introduce a regression...

In fact,

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-3.1)
0.400311696703985
sage: log_gamma(-4.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-5.1)
-2.63991581673655
sage: get_systems('log_gamma(2.1)')
['MPFR']
```
Apparently this is how MPFR deals with this function.  So maybe all is well?

Though we should not claim that it is evaluated by Ginac, because it isn't (all the above is in Sage with or without this patch).\n\nBelieve it [or not](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29335):\n\n```\nNot any negative value, but in lngamma.c:\n\n  /* if x < 0 and -2k-1 <= x <= -2k, then lngamma(x) = NaN */\n\nprobably because the gamma value is negative. This is because MPFR defines\nlngamma as log(gamma(x)) while the C standard defines it as log|gamma(x)|. I\nwonder if this should be regarded as a bug or if a new function (say,\nmpfr_lgamma) should be defined in MPFR (in which case, not before 2.3.0). Do\nother standards (other languages) define such a function, either as\nlog(gamma(x)) or as log|gamma(x)|?\n```\n\nI'm cc:ing Paul Z. just to confirm that this is intended MPFR behavior.  We should then open another ticket to make sure to use mpmath or ginac or something to get complex answers.    We currently somehow use PARI to get the complex versions.\n\n```\nsage: log_gamma(CC(-2.1))\n1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I\nsage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems\nsage: get_systems('log_gamma(CC(-2.1))')\n['PARI', 'MPFR']\n```",

I mean, for this ticket.  Though we should not claim that it is evaluated by Ginac, because it isn't (all the above is in Sage with or without this patch).

Believe it [or not](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29335):

```
Not any negative value, but in lngamma.c:

  /* if x < 0 and -2k-1 <= x <= -2k, then lngamma(x) = NaN */

probably because the gamma value is negative. This is because MPFR defines
lngamma as log(gamma(x)) while the C standard defines it as log|gamma(x)|. I
wonder if this should be regarded as a bug or if a new function (say,
mpfr_lgamma) should be defined in MPFR (in which case, not before 2.3.0). Do
other standards (other languages) define such a function, either as
log(gamma(x)) or as log|gamma(x)|?
```

I'm cc:ing Paul Z. just to confirm that this is intended MPFR behavior.  We should then open another ticket to make sure to use mpmath or ginac or something to get complex answers.    We currently somehow use PARI to get the complex versions.

```
sage: log_gamma(CC(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('log_gamma(CC(-2.1))')

Ok, here we go.

```
sage: log_gamma(-21/10).n()
NaN
sage: get_systems('log_gamma(-21/10).n()')
['ginac']
```
So both give `NaN`, but we end up using `RR.log_gamma()` as in the `GinacFunction` code.

```
sage: log_gamma(-31/10).n()
0.400311696703985
sage: log_gamma(-3.1)
0.400311696703985
sage: a = RR(5)
sage: a.log_gamma()
3.17805383034795
```
I don't see anything holding this up except cosmetics.  I'll try to make a refreshed patch momentarily.

See also #10072, where a lot of the numerical evaluation was fixed.  Anyway, updated patch with more explanation and other information coming up.  It needs light review; no code was changed, only doctests.

I'm not sure I like the last doctest either

```
           sage: conjugate(log_gamma(-2))
            conjugate(+Infinity)
```
What is the conjugate of plus infinity?  But I'll leave it for now, just to document it, unless someone has an objection, since we have in vanilla Sage

```
sage: conjugate(+Infinity)
conjugate(+Infinity)
```

I've opened #12521 for the evaluation at negative input with even ceiling function issue (i.e., `log_gamma(-2.1)`).
