<div id="comment:0"></div>

Construction of morphisms between projective varieties which are no projective space itself fails, since the test that the defining polynomials are homogeneous and of the same degree cannot test `QuotientRingElement`s as these do not have `is_homogeneous()` or `degree()` methods.

Example:

```
sage: P2.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: f = x^3+y^3+60*z^3
sage: g = y^2*z-( x^3 - 6400*z^3/3)
sage: C = Curve(f)
sage: E = Curve(g)
sage: xbar,ybar,zbar=C.coordinate_ring().gens()
sage: H = C.Hom(E)
sage: H([zbar,xbar-ybar,-(xbar+ybar)/80])
