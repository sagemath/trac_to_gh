As with [several](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/211/is-there-a-way-to-simplify_full-and-trig_reduce-a) [questions](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/273/reduce_trig-for-matrices) at ask.sagemath.  Mike Hansen's answer at the first one seems like a good start:

```
age: m = matrix([[sin(x), cos(x)], [sin(x), cos(x)]]); m
[sin(x) cos(x)]
[sin(x) cos(x)]
sage: o = m*m.transpose(); o
[sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2]
[sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2]
sage: o.apply_map(lambda x: x.trig_reduce())
[1 1]
[1 1]
```
but it seems reasonable for matrices with symbolic elements to have some of these methods (also vectors, I suppose) without having to use any special terminology.  

Open to suggestions on how that might be accomplished without creating a myriad of special methods, but by somehow piggybacking on `symbolic.expression.Expression` methods done elementwise...

Putting this under symbolics because it isn't really linear algebra, but that doesn't seem right either.

> I really like the suggestion of moving the simplification methods to somewhere closer to the maxima interface.  I would like to look into this, as it would give me a good chance of learning a more complex part of Sage.  


IIRC, Nils Bruin did this for integration, summation, limits, etc. in the library interface to maxima. You can look in the file `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py` for examples.
