Reported by Yannick Neyt in personal communication:

```
sage: k.<a>=GF(3^11)
sage: x = k([1,0,1,1]); x
a^3 + a^2 + 1
sage: x+x+x
3*a^3 + 3*a^2
```

Clearly, we should get zero in the last line, since the characteristic is 3.  The problem is visible in the PARI representation:

```
sage: pari(x)
Mod(a^3 + a^2 + Mod(1, 3), Mod(1, 3)*a^11 + Mod(2, 3)*a^2 + Mod(1, 3))
```
