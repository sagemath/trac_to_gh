<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently, to add or remove collaborators from a worksheet, one presses a button labelled "Invite Collaborators."

Since the same button is pressed when adding *or* removing, it should be labelled something like "Update Collaborator List."

Upstream: **Workaround found; Bug reported upstream.**
