More importantly, they shouldn't be trying to mutate a 2n x n matrix at row j for n<= j < 2n -- for such a parameter, mutation is *undefined*.

Otherwise, though, it looks good.

Hi Christian--

What's the point of declaring k to be of type Py_ssize_t?  I thought the point was that this would allow k to be huge, but in that case, it seems that you would get overflows when you run into the fact that i and j are declared to be integers.

Hi Hugh,

`Py_ssize_t` is the recommended integer type for cython, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/. In fact, in our current situation there is no advantage of using this type over using `int`.

Hi!

This patch is merged in, and we want the cluster algebra material to get in. So this comment is for the future.

The functionality implemented in this ticket is rather specific to the context of cluster algebras. The average matrix user will have no clue what this is about, and might get confused with the unrelated concept of mutability (as in set_immutable). So I would recommend, in a later ticket, to:

- Rename this method to something more specific like cluster_algebra_mutate
  Maybe even move it into the cluster algebra library
- Add a minimal description of what the method actually does
- Add links to the cluster algebra library / tutorial (when it exists)
- Add link to the _check_symmetrizability
