<a id='comment:2'></a>A few points. 

* The SPKG.txt file does not have the number of this ticket in it - only #10823 
* On #10823 the patch which updates the Developers Guide shows the documentation being **copied** not moved, which is better, as it leaves the build directory untouched.  
* It would make reviewing much easier, and be a better historical record, if there was a Mercurial patch of the changes attached to the ticket. 

It looks like similar issues arise with the other updated .spkg files that you produced which are related to #10823

The new matplotlib spkg above replaces the src/ directory with a pristine copy of the 1.0.1 matplotlib sources, which removes the build directory, some of the files that are generated in compilation, and trims the final spkg from 19M to 11M.

<a id='comment:7'></a>This generates the HTML and puts it where expected. However, the simple 

```
cp -r doc/* $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME/
```

is copying a **lot** of unnecessary files. There are 29 files with the extension .py, 511 files with the extension .pyc, and possibly some other unnecessary files that are being copied to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME/` There are 945 pdf files there too - I'm not quite sure how they got there. The total size of the files copied to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME/` is 115 MB

I think we need to find the unnecessary files and remove them. Something like:

```
find "$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/matplotlib" -name '*.pyc' -exec rm -f {} \;
find "$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/matplotlib" -name '*.py'  -exec rm -f {} \;
```

would be a start, but there's probably more that can be done. 

Should we generate all the PDFs if `pdftex` is present? (In which case there will be several hundred more), or delete all the PDFs??

I can't see any point in having the .py and .pyc files, but I'm not so sure about the .pdf files. 

I'm not going to copy the same comments to all the other packages - lets get one right first, before going on to the others. 

I think #10823 should be updated to advise developers to remove unnecessary files if they are present, otherwise we are just going to be copying a lot of unneeded junk, and filling up disks unnecessarily.

The documentation for matplotlib includes a *lot* of example figures (generated in both png and pdf formats) as well as the .py files that generated those examples, so I think those files are legitimate.  I'm not sure about the .pyc files---I'll check those.
