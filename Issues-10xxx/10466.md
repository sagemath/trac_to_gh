I wrote a worksheet that demonstrates a number of problems with `graphics_array` and `matrix_plot`:

https://sagenb.kaist.ac.kr:8066/home/pub/22/

Briefly, when using `graphics_array` on `matrix_plot` objects:

* axes are not drawn correctly,
* ticks options do not work well,
* the rightmost object (in a single row) is drawn a bit smaller than other objects -- I think extra axes_pad is put into that image.
