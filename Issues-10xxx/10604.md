Diagonal matrix constructor fails when given a tuple, and there is a request to support numpy arrays as input.  This seems easiest to accomplish with a re-write and documentation upgrade.

Patch contains an overhaul of the `diagonal_matrix()` constructor, fixing at least one bug, and adding support for `NumPy` arrays as input.  Two observations:

1.  Results are now sparse matrices by default.  This is a change in behavior, but causes no doctest failures anywhere in the Sage library.

2.  Original doctests for this function will still pass.  They are gone now, but were the last thing to be deleted and were fully tested.

Hi Dan,

Thanks for your help with this and staying with it - much improved based on your testing (and I may be able to excise some `NumPy`-specific code in the vector constructor based on the `prepare()` experience here.

I missed seeing the green light.  Dang. I've not been paying much attention to the patchbot since it would fail so often on the startup tests, but maybe that is fixed now.

Dan,

Did you try this against a very recent alpha?  (4.6.2.alpha1 or better?).  The failures look exactly like what happened on #4492, owing to #10443 that snuck in.  (Wrong culprit listed on #4492).

I'm on the road so cannot check immediately, but will soon.

Thanks,
Rob

I tried it against 4.6.2.alpha2, and I think I spoke too soon above...I applied #10626 and I'm still seeing the failure. So this does need some work, but (like Rob) I won't be able to do it in the next couple days.

The root of the problem is line 4426 in the `stack()` method in `matrix_integer_dense.pyx`:

```
cdef Matrix_integer_dense A = other
```
which works poorly when given a sparse matrix.

Interestingly, it works the other way around: you can stack a sparse matrix on top of a dense one. So we need to fix `stack()` for dense matrices.

Thanks, Dan.  I'll look at this more carefully this evening - should have time then.

The root problem here is my decision to return a diagonal matrix as sparse since that is exposing a variety of inconsistencies.  If I had it to do over....

Anyway, I suspect `augment()` suffers the same affliction.  I jazzed up `augment()` on #10424 with a promise to sync up `stack()` so maybe I better make good on that.

Thanks for the detective work on this one.
