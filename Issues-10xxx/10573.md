Should the status of this ticket be  "needs review"?

I applied the patch with no problem on 4.6.1.rc1 and it seems to work fine.  

Without the patch I was receiving an 
"""
Internal Server Error
An error occurred rendering the requested page. More information is available in the server log.
"""

With the patch applied there was no error message, but there was a successful search.

Comment: being relatively new to refereeing, I try to follow the guidelines in the Developer's guide.
When I did the step:

./sage -coverage devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py

the result was 

SCORE devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py: 37% (74 of 200)

Conclusion?  The patch works, I will change status to positive review, but here is one sample .py file with modest coverage.

Clearly, this is a bug in the Developer's guide.  It is not a problem if the coverage of a file is less than 100% (I guess it would be a problem if a patch makes the doctest coverage go *down*).
