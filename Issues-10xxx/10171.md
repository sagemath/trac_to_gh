On OS X with a fresh install of Sage:

```
wstein@bsd:~/build/sage-4.5.3/devel/sage/sage$ sage -hg serve -p 8200
```

In another window type

```
wstein@bsd:~$ open  http://localhost:8200
```

And in the first window see:

```
/Users/was/build/sage-4.5.3/local/bin/sage-sage: line 440: 49631 Trace/BPT trap          hg "$@"
```

The same happens with sage-4.6.alpha3 and port 8000. 

This is not a problem on Linux.  It's only on OS X, as far as I can tell.  

The solution to this is probably the same as for #6440 -- which is Upgrade Mercurial.  
The version in Sage is ancient -- 1.3.1 -- but the current version of Mercurial is version 1.6.4.  That said, I just tried upgrading (which is really confusing, since mercurial is in local/lib/python/, not in local/lib/python/site-packages), and still get the problem:

```

However, installing Mercurial into my systemwide Python works fine.  So I don't know what is messed up about Sage's Python.

You have to browse to http://localhost:8200.  Did that work?

Popping open a browser, etc., is all stuff I wrote specially for the notebook.  I doubt moinmoin has that functionality.  It could be added...

Anyway, I seem to recall there was a discussion on sage-devel about removing moinmoin from sage, which would make this ticket invalid.
