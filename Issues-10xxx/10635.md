The "factor" function in polynomial_element.pyx needs to be refactored, because it has to be modified every time a new interesting base ring gets added to Sage. 

Instead of importing a ton of different rings, the function should just call a method on the base ring, e.g., 

```
def `_factor_univariate_`polynomial(self, f):
    ...
```
Since the code in factor is for generic polynomials, it doesn't use their internal representation, so this should be fine.   It just turns out that factoring algorithms depend a huge amount on the base ring, and polynomials get created over tons of different bases (but there are far less classes that derive from "polynomial"). 

I suggest for this ticket, at a minimum we add a quick "hasattr" check at the top of the current factor function, then leave the existing code.  Then new code can be written to use this.  In the near future somebody can move most of the imports and cases out the current factor function, so it becomes very short, and the code gets put in the right place. 

A major motivation for this is that people create their own new rings R in external code that depends on sage, and want to be able to factor polynomials over R.  They do *not* define a new class for polynomials over R.  It seems silly for them to have to patch the core sage library to get factorization functionality.

As someone interested in this change, let me chime in with a few suggestions of my own.

(1) A similar refactoring should be done for roots().  It's true factor() can be used to find roots, but that's not necessarily the best approach.  This suggests the names ._univariate_polynomial_x for x=factor,roots,etc.

(2) So-called 'modular' gcd algorithms give a real boost to rings where applicable, so it would be nice to let x=gcd in (1).

(3) Consider whether options such as 'multiplicities=False' should really be options to .univariate_polynomial_factor() or whether they can be handled 'universally'.

I've attached a reviewer patch fixing a doctest error in a factorization.

(The order of the factors changes, depending on the sign of a "zero" term in the polynomial which is one factor. The example now looks a bit ugly, but I don't want to wait until we have `zero_at()` methods for all kinds of domains, and just tagging the whole doctest "`# random`" would also be odd, IMHO. Note that it previously didn't fail on *all* 32-bit systems, e.g. *not* 32-bit SPARC, and tagging the results "`# 32-bit`" and "`# 64-bit`" would have been inadequate anyway, since the machine word width is completely unrelated, i.e., that the test failed on x86 processors only is just a weird coincidence.)

Factorization over function fields (provided by #9054) uses the function defined in this ticket (_factor_univariate_polynomial). However, in some cases it requires a parameter proof=False to work. So, the easy solution for #9054 was to add the default parameter proof=True to polynomial_element.factor() and pass it on to `_factor_univariate_`polynomial.
So, to make #9054 work with this ticket, should we just pass on all *args and **kwargs to `_factor_univariate_`polynomial? I do not understand what you mean by 'universally' but I guess it's related to this question.

Replying to [cjh](#comment%3A1):
> (3) Consider whether options such as 'multiplicities=False' should really be options to .univariate_polynomial_factor() or whether they can be handled 'universally'.

Sorry for the false alarm. I must have been working with an outdated version of #9054. Actually the proof parameter is passed on.
Anyway, I'm thinking about doing parts of #11731, so I'd still like to know what you had in mind with the 'universally'.
