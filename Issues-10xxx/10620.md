Okay, I have a new spkg, actually, two.  The first ("p0") is just a straightforward upgrade of the previous version.  However, we should probably update sage_autodoc.py in light of changes to the Sphinx extension autodoc.py, on which it is based.  I can provide a patch to the Sage library modifying sage_autodoc.py if necessary.

A different approach: the second spkg ("p1") autogenerates sage_autodoc.py from autodoc.py, and saves sage_autodoc.py in sphinx/ext instead of in sage/doc/common.  So using this one requires a change to sage/doc/common/conf.py, which I've provided.  This approach seems as though it will be easier to maintain, or at least it will be easier to keep sage_autodoc.py in line with autodoc.py.

With both of these approaches, I get some warnings about cross-references, which are why the other entries are in the patch for the Sage library.  I'm seeing lots of broken cross-references, though: take a look at the reference manual for categories/examples/finite_weyl_groups.py: 

```
    Only the following basic operations are implemented:
     - :meth:`one`
     - :meth:`product`
     - :meth:`simple_reflection`
     - :meth:`Element.has_right_descent`.
{{{
None of these produces a link.  I don't know what's going on.

Concerning cross references, I've been doing some work in #9128. So my suggestion is to upgrade the spkg (I can probably find the time to review it this week) and the keep the cross reference problem for another ticket. What to you think ?

Unfortunately, when I tried this approach, the new `sage_autodoc` module didn't work perfectly, probably because of recent changes in `autodoc`.  This could be dealt with on another ticket.  Following Leif's general suggestion about this kind of thing, perhaps we should add a "To do" item to the "Special Build Instructions" section of SPKG.txt.  I've prepared a new spkg (based on yours) with this change.  The spkg also removes the patch to 'autodoc.py', since I don't think we use that anymore: we use 'sage_autodoc.py' instead.
