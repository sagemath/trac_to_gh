Hey Nicolas and Florent (and Vincent),

I was wondering what the status of this patch is since #13605 is currently based on this patch. I can commute #13605 past, but I would prefer to keep the current order (especially if this patch is close to being completed).

Thank you,

Travis

What's new:

Hey,

A few comments/questions:

- I prefer the name `GradedSets` over `SetsWithGrading`, it's a more natural name to me.
- The example, I don't think there should be the need for another `NonNegativeIntegers` class. Can't we just use the existing `sage.sets.NonNegativeIntegers` with the required methods and placed in this category?
- Similar to above, I'd like to see all sets which belong actually into this category. Or at least a few more of the big classes.
- Grade should be implemented as an abstract Element method
- I don't like the default implementation of `graded_component()` since it assumes the first argument of subset (which may not be implemented) is the graded component. If you want to use the `subset()` method, you should call it with `self.subset(grade=grade)`.
- It's not well documented what methods must be implemented. The "automatic" way is to make them `@abstract_method`s.

Here's also some more wish-list type things that I'd like to see, but can wait for a followup ticket:

- Simple API for grading shifts
- Checking that morphisms preserve grading
- Make `degree()` call `grade()` (thus act like an alias, unfortunately in categories you can't simply make an alias by `degree = grade` [it will reference the wrong function]).

Thanks,

Travis

I should add that those objections were natural! It would be good to explain in the documentation why, for example, SetsWithGrading rather than GradedSets. But this patch has been waiting long enough and it needs to be finally be put to real use; let's not delay it for this reason.

+1 as well on the feature requests in a later patch! (except for degree=grade for which I'd rather wait until we have some large scale feedback to see if there really would be a desire for it).
