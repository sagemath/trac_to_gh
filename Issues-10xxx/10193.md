<a id='comment:25'></a>Hey,

A few comments/questions:

- I prefer the name `GradedSets` over `SetsWithGrading`, it's a more natural name to me.
- The example, I don't think there should be the need for another `NonNegativeIntegers` class. Can't we just use the existing `sage.sets.NonNegativeIntegers` with the required methods and placed in this category?
- Similar to above, I'd like to see all sets which belong actually into this category. Or at least a few more of the big classes.
- Grade should be implemented as an abstract Element method
- I don't like the default implementation of `graded_component()` since it assumes the first argument of subset (which may not be implemented) is the graded component. If you want to use the `subset()` method, you should call it with `self.subset(grade=grade)`.
- It's not well documented what methods must be implemented. The "automatic" way is to make them ``@`abstract_method`s.

Here's also some more wish-list type things that I'd like to see, but can wait for a followup ticket:

- Simple API for grading shifts
- Checking that morphisms preserve grading
- Make `degree()` call `grade()` (thus act like an alias, unfortunately in categories you can't simply make an alias by `degree = grade` [it will reference the wrong function]).

Thanks,

Travis
