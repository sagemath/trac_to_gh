I added a pexpect interface to sbcl.  It is similar to the ECL lisp interface.  This was requested by Sara Billey.

```

sage: sbcl(3)*sbcl(8)
24
sage: sbcl.eval('(* 5 5)')
'25'
sage: sbcl_console()
This is SBCL 1.0.40.0.debian, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
More information about SBCL is available at <http://www.sbcl.org/>.

SBCL is free software, provided as is, with absolutely no warranty.
It is mostly in the public domain; some portions are provided under
BSD-style licenses.  See the CREDITS and COPYING files in the
distribution for more information.
