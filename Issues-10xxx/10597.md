Do you refer to the objection that trapezoid rule is not a Riemann sum?  IMHO it is moot.

While helping a high school Calculus student with basic integration I tried to use Sage to do some computational examples, and when it didn't work as I expected it to I came across this ticket. The student's textbook considered a trapezoidal sum to be a Riemann sum, so I think pushing this ticket through would be helpful from the standpoint of wanting Sage to be a useful educational tool.

It seems that only minor updates are needed to get this patch to a point where it would be acceptable. I would be willing to make these small changes.

I was asked about this ticket recently by a beginner, since it has the beginner keyword. But after looking at the ticket, I think this is not a good beginner ticket, especially now that the underlying code has been completely rewritten since this was first proposed.

I'm removing the beginner tag. But I also suggest that this ticket be closed --- there are no longer any Riemann sums here, so the discussion as to whether a trapezoidal sum should be considered no longer applies.
