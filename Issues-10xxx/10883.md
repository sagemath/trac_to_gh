There is some cases for which the degree method for PermutationGroup return a GapElement and not a sage integer.

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]])
sage: type(G.degree())
<type 'int'>
sage: H = G._gap_()
sage: H
Group( [ (1,2,3,4) ] )
sage: I = PermutationGroup(gap_group=H)
sage: type(I.degree())
<class 'sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement'>
sage: I == G
True
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(6,3)
sage: type(I.degree())
<class 'sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement'>
```

Whhaaaaa!

I managed to report a bug which is not in Sage! 

The quoting behavior was obtained with a very special state of Sage-Combinat. Effectively, with no patch applied, there is no problem. The method works fine.

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(6,3)
sage: type(G.degree())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]])
sage: H = G._gap_()
sage: I = PermutationGroup(gap_group=H)
sage: type(I.degree())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

I just realize it when the buildbot said the apply failed... For this reason, I think this ticket should be closed.
