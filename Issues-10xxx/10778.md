Here's an outline:

1. cd to SAGE_ROOT
2. cd to devel/sage-main/doc/
3. cp -rf fr/ hu
4. cd hu
5. rm -rf tutorial/
6. cd a_tour_of_sage/
7. Put your Hungarian translation in the file index.rst (remove the French translation first).
8. Apply the following patch:

```
diff --git a/doc/common/build_options.py b/doc/common/build_options.py
--- a/doc/common/build_options.py
+++ b/doc/common/build_options.py
@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@
 
 import os
 SAGE_DOC = os.environ['SAGE_DOC']
-LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']
+LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr', 'hu']
 SPHINXOPTS = ""
 PAPER = ""
 OMIT = ["introspect"]  # docs/dirs to omit when listing and building 'all'
```
1. cd SAGE_ROOT
2. Now build your Hungarian translation:

```
./sage -docbuild hu/a_tour_of_sage html
```

Once you're happy with your Hungarian translation, produce a patch and post it on this ticket.
