Currently we rewrite all of the local/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc files every time we move locations. Instead, we should just use the --define-variable option of pkg-config to define a ${SAGE_ROOT} variable. Then we don't have to keep rewriting files every time.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING:

1. Download a fresh sage-4.7.alpha5.tar source archive

2. Extract and delete the spkg/standard/sage_scripts-4.7.alpha5.spkg

3. Put http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sage_scripts-4.7.alpha5.p0.spkg into the spkg/standard/ directory

4. Make Sage

Note to release manager: you have to edit the sage_scripts spkg-install to copy over the pkg-config shell script; see my sage_scripts spkg above.

P.S. Why is the sage_scripts spkg-install not under version control?!?

```
(Note that the `egrep` patterns are a bit "redundant", to be partially also used with `sed`. ;-) )

So briefly, in my Sage 4.6 **final** (built from scratch), `gsl.pc` and `pynac.pc` lack a `SAGE_ROOT=...` line, while `libpng.pc` has in addition a superfluous line `SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}`, and `libR.pc` lacks a definition of both `prefix` and `SAGE_ROOT` (but the file is sane, i.e. contains the proper hard-coded path(s) in `rhome` and `rincludedir`.)

I really wonder what might have caused the differences between 4.6.rc0 and 4.6 final. Do these files get modified by other scripts than `sage-location`?

The redundant `SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}` is clearly a "bug" in #9210's `initialize_pkgconfig_files()`, since it doesn't check if a `.pc` file is just a link to another one (which is the case for `libpng.pc`). Testing for an already existing `SAGE_ROOT=...` would of course be possible as well.

Possible. Regarding the number of spkgs affected, rather "no" (not now)...

We should just check there if the files *are* already patched.

I also suggested elsewhere to make it more verbose.

I hesitated to change its title... ;-)

The modification of the freetype spkg should IMHO be addressed at #9523 as well.

The situation is much worse since the logic of patching / "initializing" the `.pc` files **exactly once** (and all at the same time) is currently completely broken.

I'll write a shell script to (re-)initialize them conditionally.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I take that back about this ticket being doomed.  In fact, the solution is *much* easier.  Instead of defining `${SAGE_ROOT}` at the top of pkg-config, we should wrap the system pkg-config using the --define-variable option:

```
       --define-variable=VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE
              This sets a global value for a variable, overriding the value in any files. Most packages define the vari-
              able "prefix", for example, so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --print-errors --define-variable=prefix=/foo \
                             --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /foo

```

So if we have a pkg-config in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` which is something like:

```/bin/sh
pkg-config --define-variable=SAGE_ROOT=<whatever> $*
```

then we don't have to keep mucking with the .pc files every time our location moves.  We just need to do a simple string substitution the first time Sage is built or the first time any package makes a .pc file.

This solves both the main problem of this ticket and the problem with double-initialization.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Finally (and again) returning to this...

* We don't need to "wrap" `pkg-config` (and if we would, one should use `"$`@`"` instead of `$*`).
* We don't have to `--define-variable=SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}`, provided we **don't** put any [hardcoded] definitions of `SAGE_ROOT` (or `SAGE_LOCAL`) into the `.pc` files, which I more than once said is totally superfluous if we for example use (literally) `prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local`:

```python
def initialize_pkgconfig_files():
    """
    Insert a sage_local variable in each pkg_config file and replace
    them to make the paths portable.
    """
    LIB = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(SAGE_ROOT), 'local', 'lib')
    PKG = os.path.join(LIB,'pkgconfig')
    for name in os.listdir(PKG):
        filename=os.path.join(PKG,name)
        if os.path.splitext(filename)[1]==".pc":
            with open(filename) as file:
                config = file.read()

            new_config = config.replace(os.path.abspath(SAGE_ROOT), "${SAGE_ROOT}")

            new_config = 'SAGE_ROOT=%s\n'%os.path.abspath(SAGE_ROOT)+new_config

            with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                file.write(new_config)
```
 (This is from `local/bin/sage-location`, Sage 4.7.1.rc0.) 

 There we have to remove the second assignment to `new_config`. The function `update_pkgconfig_files()` should be deleted (or no longer used), since it just updates `SAGE_ROOT=...` definitions with a new **hardcoded path** for `SAGE_ROOT`.
* We may still have to fix *a few* `.pc` files in their corresponding `spkg-install` files. I did this for R / `libR.pc` (cf. #9668) in a new r-2.10.1.p6 spkg (which I haven't yet uploaded though). For *most* `.pc` files defining `prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local` (see above) is sufficient, and `initialize_pkgconfig_files()` does this, although it could do better by explicitly looking for `^prefix=...`. (Also, we could do the same -- more reliably -- from some **shell** script, e.g. `sage-spkg`, using `sed`, since Python is not necessarily available during the build. If we do, we no longer have to deal with `.pc` files in `sage-location` at all. `sage-spkg` already calls `sage-make_relative` after every spkg installation, so this would fit well.)

Jason's new patch to `sage-location` already does
* remove the second assignment to `new_config`, which defined `SAGE_ROOT` to the current `$SAGE_ROOT` (i.e., a hardcoded path),
* remove the no longer necessary function `update_pkgconfig_files()`.

(The note on) using `--define-variable=SAGE_ROOT=${SAGE_ROOT}` is not necessary though, see above.

No offense btw.

<a id='comment:26'></a>*Unfortunately my reasoning is now spread across a few tickets...* 8/

First of all, we don't have to wrap `pkg-config`, which would not necessarily be available during the whole build (including upgrades), and doing so might confuse [dumb] build scripts testing for its presence on systems that lack a "real" `pkg-config`.

I now seem to recall why using `${SAGE_ROOT}` without explicitly defining it in the `.pc` files "worked for me" last year -- I was using `$${SAGE_ROOT}`, which postpones expansion to the shell, like it does in Makefiles.

But there is an even safer way (cf. [comment:ticket:11687:1 this comment] at #11687), namely to define the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR` in `sage-env` and use the corresponding `.pc`-file variable `pc_top_builddir` (instead of `SAGE_ROOT`) in all `.pc` files, e.g.

```sh
# We set PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR to $SAGE_ROOT in sage-env,
# such that ${pc_top_builddir} always yields this.
prefix=${pc_top_builddir}/local
...
# All further directory definitions are relative to ${pc_top_builddir}
# or ${prefix}.
```

Substitutions in ("initialization" of) `.pc` files should IMHO be performed from or better directly within `sage-spkg` (or an spkg's `spkg-install` if necessary), of course not "fixing" individual files more than once. We then can drop the `pkg-config`-related code in `sage-location` completely, or otherwise have to make sure it is consistent with the other one, i.e. doesn't mess things up afterwards (as it currently does).

We also have to fix setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` in `sage-env`; see #11687.

Well, it's just another situation where its application is useful (and which is quite similar to its original intent). The way Sage uses its own prefix / subtree of typical system directories (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/{bin,lib,include}`) is just not very common, so the developer of `pkg-config` didn't have it in mind.

To make it less obscure (to people actually looking at the `.pc` files), we could use

```
SAGE_ROOT=${pc_top_builddir} # the latter is set "dynamically" by sage-env
prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
...
# (further references to SAGE_ROOT rather than pc_top_builddir)
```
(Adding comments to the `.pc` files isn't bad anyway; I used to also add a comment telling when the file was [last] modified by Sage, e.g. for debugging.)




W.r.t. users already using that variable (`pc_top_builddir`) for other purposes: 

I don't think anybody will have it in his/her system-wide `.pc` files, but at least in case `PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR` is already set, we could issue a warning.




Using `$${SAGE_ROOT}` instead isn't that safe, since programs using parameters supplied by `pkg-config` do *not necessarily* use the shell to execute commands with these parameters (though they usually do; I'm currently not aware of any counter-example), in which case `${SAGE_ROOT}/...` would get passed verbatim to the commands, e.g. to the compiler or the linker.
