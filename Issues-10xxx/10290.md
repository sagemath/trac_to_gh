The Sage documentation looks much more beautiful now, especially Cython code blocks that have been specially designated to use Cython code highlighting. I love the demonstration of how to highlight a Cython code block. I'm OK with the patch to Pygments 1.3.1; the patch is small enough to be easily understood.
