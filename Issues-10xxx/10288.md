Trying to install this experiemental package on a Sun Ultra 27 (3.33 GHz Intel Xeon) running OpenSolaris 06/2009, it fails as it can't reconise the system. 

I've not tried it, but I would also expect it to fail on a Solaris 10 machine with an x86 processor such as 'fulvia' on Skynet. 

I've not tried a 64-bit build (i.e. with `SAGE64=yes`).

Johh, 

your patch clearly works for a 32-bit build on OpenSolaris, though I'm not sure its the best solution to the problem. I think it would be better to make the automatic operating-system detection work, which means the problem can be reported upstream, and get fixed. 

That's easily done by checking if `sun` is defined, rather than checking if `__sparc__` is defined. 

```

```

This can then remove the Solaris operating system specific patch in spkg-install. 

Another problem is that there's no code to handle 64-bit on any Solaris platform, or probably on OS X too, as the variable SAGE64 is never used. I tried fixing that by exporting CXXFLAGS, with the following code:

```
if [ "x$CXXFLAG64" = x ] ; then
   CXXFLAG64=-m64
fi

if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ; then
   CXX="$CXXFLAGS CXXFLAG64"
   export CXXFLAGS
fi
```

Unfortunately, the compiler g++ is hard-coded in most of the Makefiles and CXXFLAGS is ignored. Although I've not checked it, I think editing src/make/config/sun from its previous version: 

```
CXX = g++
COMPILE = $(CXX) -O2 -ansi -pedantic -Wall
LINK    = $(CXX) -s
LINKGUI = $(CXX) -s
```

with

```
COMPILE = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -O2 -ansi -pedantic -Wall
LINK    = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -s
LINKGUI = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -s
```

Then it should use the -m64 option when building all objects if `SAGE64=yes`

Reading the web site, it would appear on Macs one needs to use:

```
case `uname` in 
    "Darwin")
        target='mac';;
```

I can't find any reference to 'mac' in any makefile, or anywhere else for that matter. (I used the -R option to GNU grep). It seems to me setting 'target=mac' is doing absolutely nothing. 

I've late here and I need some sleep, but there were a few things I found that were wrong.

Right, this is what is (and has been) in spkg-install.
 
> I can't find any reference to 'mac' in any makefile, or anywhere else for that matter. (I used the -R option to GNU grep). It seems to me setting 'target=mac' is doing absolutely nothing. 

I think it uses the file src/make/config/mac for configuration.  Maybe the string "mac" isn't in any file, but there is a file called "mac", which your grep may not have found.

I'll look at your other comments later.

Of course you need to add the target on specific platform. Finally I am not sure
we need LINKGUI since it is for producing a wxwidget apps and it has its own target
according to the compilation instructions. That is you need target=wxunx on unix like systems.

In which case it's even easier to fix than I thought. Thank you Francois. \n\n```\nif [ \"x$CXXFLAG64\" = x ] ; then\n   CXXFLAG64=-m64\nfi\n\nif [ \"x$SAGE64\" = xyes ] ; then\n   CXX=\"$CXXFLAGS CXXFLAG64\"\nfi\n```\n\nthen $MAKE CXX=$CXX CXXFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS etc should solve it. \n\nDo we know for sure the package can't be built in parallel, so one must set j=1, or was that just a safe choice? \n\nOne other point i forgot to make. The 'prereq' script checks that the version of make is GNU, so arguably this does not need repeating.

Hi all
The fact there is a mac file no doubt means I was wrong, and so that is needed.

I was not aware that the arguments to make would solve the problem. In which case it's even easier to fix than I thought. Thank you Francois. 

```
if [ "x$CXXFLAG64" = x ] ; then
   CXXFLAG64=-m64
fi

if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ; then
   CXX="$CXXFLAGS CXXFLAG64"
fi
```

then $MAKE CXX=$CXX CXXFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS etc should solve it. 

Do we know for sure the package can't be built in parallel, so one must set j=1, or was that just a safe choice? 

One other point i forgot to make. The 'prereq' script checks that the version of make is GNU, so arguably this does not need repeating. But I guess this being optional, the hardware/software might have changed, so recheking is not a bad idea. 


However, despite what spkg-install says, the version number of gnu make is not checked. 

I think im going to be stuck to using someone elses Windows machine for the rest of the afternoon, so wil have no Unix access. 

Dave

Oops, that bit of code needs to be:

which will addend -m64 (or another flag if needed) to CXXFLAGS on 64-bit builds.

Replying to [drkirkby](#comment%3A6):

> then $MAKE CXX=$CXX CXXFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS etc should solve it. 

I can't get this to work on my Mac; instead I'm using

```
$MAKE target=$target COMPILE="${CXX} ${CXXFLAGS}"
```

> Do we know for sure the package can't be built in parallel, so one must set j=1, or was that just a safe choice? 

It actually says not to use "make -j..." on one of the web pages.  I've added a citation to spkg-install and to SPKG.txt.

> One other point i forgot to make. The 'prereq' script checks that the version of make is GNU, so arguably this does not need repeating. But I guess this being optional, the hardware/software might have changed, so recheking is not a bad idea. 

Okay.

> However, despite what spkg-install says, the version number of gnu make is not checked. 

You're right.  Version 3.77 of make was released in 1998, so I'm inclined to remove the check altogether.

I've updating the spkg and the patch.  This is still pretty experimental, but I'll mark it as "needs review" anyway.

We now now more precisely the problem - the original code assumed Solaris only if the processor was SPARC, where now it assumes Solaris is 'sun' is defined. But I don't mind making that as a review patch. But an spkg to test would be nice.

Sorry John. 

This is odd. When I try to install with 'sage -i', the variable SAGE64 was ignored, which concluded me to believe you had not updated the .spkg.

I *think* that when you run "sage -i", if you give it a URL, it sees if it has saved a copy somewhere local, and if so, it uses that instead of downloading it again.  If you give it a path, it uses the file.  If I'm right, that would explain it.

Thanks John, you are right. 

Although this experiemental package is not going to be merged into Sage, someone needs to take care that the version on the Sage web site is updated. I don't know if that's something the release manager can do, or if someone else has to do it.
