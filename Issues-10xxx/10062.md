<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This was caused by the problem reported at #10064. The `arctan2()` automatic evaluation function checks if the second argument is positive, line 1062 of `inifcns_trans.cpp` in pynac:

```
		// atan2(0, x), x real and positive -> 0
		if (x.info(info_flags::positive))
			return _ex0;
```
