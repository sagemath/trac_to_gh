<a id='comment:1'></a>Here is a reference (available online !):

Abramowitz and Stegun: Handbook of Mathematical Functions

Branch cuts are given in chapter 4. Elementary Transcendental Functions.
Pages 67 (for log), 79 (for inverse trig func) and 86 (for inverse hyper fun) are of special interest.

A good link on the web :

- GSL http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Complex-Numbers.html which refers to the above one and some from below

Here are some other links on the internet :

- Mathworld: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BranchCut.html which refers to Mathematica
- GNU emacs Calc: http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/calc/calc_217.html referring to Mathematica
- Numpy : http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arccosh.html
