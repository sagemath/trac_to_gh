In older versions of Sage, extracting a one-column submatrix
of a NumPy matrix could return it as a one-row matrix if using
a Sage integer for the column number:

```
sage: m = numpy.matrix(numpy.arange(6).reshape(3, 2))
sage: m[:, int(0)]  # correct submatrix extraction
matrix([[0],
        [2],
        [4]])
sage: m[:, Integer(0)]  # incorrect submatrix extraction
matrix([[0, 2, 4]])
```

Current versions of NumPy no longer have this problem.

This ticket adds a doctest to ensure correct submatrix
extraction keeps working.

It's not a Sage-specific issue.  E.g. using gmpy's mpz has the same issue:

```
Python 2.7 (r27:82500, Aug 18 2010, 23:33:57) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
>>> import numpy, gmpy
>>> 
>>> m = numpy.matrix(numpy.arange(6)).reshape(3,2)
>>> m
matrix([[0, 1],
        [2, 3],
        [4, 5]])
>>> m[:,0]
matrix([[0],
        [2],
        [4]])
>>> m[:,gmpy.mpz(0)]
matrix([[0, 2, 4]])
```

The underlying issue is that numpy doesn't recognize Sage integers as scalars:

```
sage: numpy.isscalar(int(0))
True
sage: numpy.isscalar((0))
False
sage: numpy.ScalarType
(<type 'int'>, <type 'float'>, <type 'complex'>, <type 'long'>, <type 'bool'>, <type 'str'>, <type 'unicode'>, <type 'buffer'>, <type 'numpy.int64'>, <type 'numpy.int16'>, <type 'numpy.complex128'>, <type 'numpy.void'>, <type 'numpy.int32'>, <type 'numpy.uint32'>, <type 'numpy.float128'>, <type 'numpy.string_'>, <type 'numpy.int8'>, <type 'numpy.uint8'>, <type 'numpy.float32'>, <type 'numpy.bool_'>, <type 'numpy.uint64'>, <type 'numpy.int64'>, <type 'numpy.uint64'>, <type 'numpy.complex64'>, <type 'numpy.unicode_'>, <type 'numpy.uint16'>, <type 'numpy.float64'>, <type 'numpy.object_'>, <type 'numpy.complex256'>)
```

because it doesn't recognize it as a generic and it's not listed in the acceptable scalar types.  This means the wrong branch is taken here:

```
# numpy/matrixlib/defmatrix.py
        if out.ndim == 1:
            sh = out.shape[0]
            # Determine when we should have a column array
            try:
                n = len(index)
            except:
                n = 0
            if n > 1 and isscalar(index[1]):
                out.shape = (sh,1)
            else:
                out.shape = (1,sh)
```

n=2, but isscalar(Integer(0)) is False.

<div id="comment:16" align="right">comment:16</div>

Demoted from 'critical' to 'major': fixed already in Sage 8.2, maybe before.

Doctest needed. Tentative doctest:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: m = np.matrix(np.arange(4).reshape(2, 2))
sage: a = m[:, int(0)]
sage: b = m[:, Integer(0)]
sage: print('{}\n{}\n{}'.format(m, a, b))
[[0 1]
 [2 3]]
[[0]
 [2]]
[[0]
 [2]]
```

Where could such a doctest go?

I would think that the best place for this would be `src/sage/tests`, which already has files such as `sympy.py` and `parigp.py`.
