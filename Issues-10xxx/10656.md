Because it isn't, one cannot, for example, overlay `text()` onto a `GraphicsArray()`, or use any of the other `Graphics()` functionality.

`GraphicsArray._repr()` could (but doesn't) return a matplotlib `Figure`, so perhaps this can be resolved with the help of #5128.

See the post at asksage about [this issue](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/308/can-i-convert-a-graphicsarray-object-to-a-graphics) for more details.
