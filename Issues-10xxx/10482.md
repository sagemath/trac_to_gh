this  all works OK (on sage 4.6.1.alpha3);
what I do not know is whether GraphWL should be installed as a method for graphs.

Can we have a mildly interesting example in the doctest, i.e. refining which does not produce an orbital-induced refinement?
The smallest non-directed example like this is the [Shrikhande strongly regular graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrikhande_graph) on 16 vertices; a the smallest directed example a certain tournament on 15 vertices.

Shrikhande graph is mentioned on #9136.
Maybe you can contribute its Sage implementation along the way!

So either the code doesn't do what I thought it did after all (certainly possible), or I misread the paper or other resources in some subtle way, or the algorithm in the paper is wrong in some subtle way (I wrote `STABIL.c` more or less completely based on the description of the algorithm in the paper and not on the original code, which *does* work on `wl-bug`). I'm not sure which of these is the case, and now I don't any longer remember the code I wrote or the contents of the paper well enough to try to find out which of these is the case.

Perhaps at this point the better solution is to just use the old code (which is what you originally suggested in 2010). My code was supposed to allow for a wider variety of input and more memory usage than made sense back in the 80s, but all of that is worthless if the output is not correct... :(
