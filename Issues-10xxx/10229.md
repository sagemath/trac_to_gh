Create a file, attach it in a Sage session, then delete/move the file.  Sage does not like this - and every command results in `OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/path/to/attached/file.py`.  It won't even let you detach the file.

At the moment before each command is executed, Sage checks to see if any attached files have been modified.  Presumably instead it should except this error, remove the file from the list of attached files, and inform the user.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I wish I could include a patch here, but my sage install is having an unrelated issue right now, but this is an easy fix so it may be worth mentioning.

For sage/misc/preparser.py, wrap lines 1790 to 1794 in a try block, and use

{{except OSError, e:
      if e.errno==2:
          pass
}}

This will at least make it continue working. What would be our desired response to a moved/deleted file? I think it would make sense to detach it, since otherwise it will just keep attempting to go through this. Do we want to display a message to the user as well?

Sorry for not posting a patch, I will try to when I fix my sage install.
