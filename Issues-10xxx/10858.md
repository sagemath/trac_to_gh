Attachment [trac_10858_empty_matrix_fix.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10858/trac_10858_empty_matrix_fix.patch) by johanbosman created at 2011-04-06 16:59:39

The pointer _entries remains uninitialised for empty matrices but the m4ri function _mzd_mul_naive does address it.  The attached patch fixes this.

Hej Johan,

Bedankt voor t fixen :).

I just looked at it and the patch aplies fine without failing doctest. Also found no problems when trying to get segfaults with similar examples. So I give it a positive review.
