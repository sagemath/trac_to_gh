Great idea.

1. Something I was already planning to do.  My intention is to create the mogodb entries directly from the C++ programs which create the curve data files (much of which can be done with Sage scripts which I am already writing).

2. Small problem:  what ids to use, when we do not have complete sets of isogeny classes for a given conductor?

3. Good idea again;  can be handled along with 1.

3 components are concatenated:  (1) the conductor (positive integer); (2) the isogeny class (1 or more letters a..z); (3) the number of the curve in the class (positive integer).

For details of the coding in (2), and how the classes and curves are ordered, see

After reading the labeling section of the paper, I have come up with the following conclusion.

1. first isogeny in the list is A and first curve is 1, or
2. try to follow the cremona format on the curves that are given, knowing the list is incomplete.

in either case label could be 'sw37a1', identify that it is not Cremona label but a Stein-Watkins label. 

Problem with 1 is it is has no reasoning. 
Problem with 2 is it could be mistaken for Cremona label, since it would follow that algorithm.

Currently, I have been using 1. I will try to upload a patch with first 10^5 curves for review soon.

Is there any point in including SW curves of conductor < 130000 which are already in my database?

For conductor > 130000 I think it is a good idea to add the prefix sw.

I have scripts to create all of the files in the format at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/
from a single file containing just one curve in each isogeny class, i.e. from a file like http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/allcurves.00000-09999 but only containing the lines where field #3 ==1 (and called curves.00000-09999).  

So all that would be needed for the SW part of this would be to create from the SW database such a file, but sorting the curves by conductor and then (arbitrarily, or intelligently) sorting the isogeny classes.

Now if someone also re-writes the existing Sage scripts (in sage/databases/cremona.py) to create mogodb files instead of the old style db files, all that would be needed would be to run those after the ones I have written.  On the other hand, at this point there would be no point (perhaps) in having all the intermediate plain text files at all:  instead,  we could go directly from a single curves.* file to the complete mongodb.

Small asides: 1. in the scripts I am writing I used Magma's HeegnerPoint function to get generators for (some) rank 1 curves.  2. Despite what I said above I have not yet written the (easy) scripts for the aplist, degphi and intpts data files, since I have had other duties to perform...

I actually thought about question 2 on Thursday.

Ultimately this database might contain curves that come not only from the Cremona or Stein-Watkins tables but also from ABC@home data, Cremona's egros code, parameterizations of elliptic curves with prescribed torsion subgroups, taking quadratic twists, and whatever other dirty tricks we can think up.

Let's say hypothetically that there are 25 isogeny classes in Stein-Watkins of conductor 240672 (I'm guessing there are far more). Then these should be labeled sw240672A to sw240672Y. A couple months down the road, I might then add (though some refereed process) the isogeny class of the elliptic curve [0, -1, 0, -13808832780322, -19750744373708998160]. This isogeny class should be called something like we240672Z, but people should be able to call it up from the label 240672Z. 

Until we know all elliptic curves of conductor 240672 and it becomes something like we240672cn through John's scheme. 

When we know all elliptic curves with conductor less than or equal to 240672 then we can drop the prefix. Until then, someone curious about where this curve (with analytic order of sha 361) came from should probably be able to ask me.

This seems quite sensible to me -- but then perhaps I would say that, since the proposal is that my database is special and does not require any prefix, while everyone else's needs some qualification!

It's a pity that the label for an isogeny class is not (currently) something which is an intrinsic property of that class (unlike the conductor), so we can only have definitive labels when we know that we have all curves of a given conductor.  But I cannot think of an alternative which is short and simple.
