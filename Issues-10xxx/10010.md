The PyCuda Package from Andreas Kloeckner (a useful GPU Programming tool for NVIDIA Graphic cards). See http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda for more Info

The package can be downloaded from: http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=pycuda-0.94.1.spkg (direct link: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.1.spkg)

Installation Notes:
* Install CUDA on your machine: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_toolkit_rc.html
* set the SAGE_CUDA variable in your shell with:
  ` export SAGE_CUDA =/where/you/have/installed/cuda`
  (i set in .bashrc)
* install package. (Download it from the links above)
* IMPORTANT: After installation the setuptools package has to be reinstalled!! Because the installer uses the distributed egg package. This messes somehow with setuptools and will be removed after the installation. But this destroys setup tools! 
* enjoy!

**UPDATE:** Now there is a new version of PyCuda which requires setuptools-0.6c11 (see #10361), where the reinstallment of setuptools is not needed any more. The download link is:
http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.2.spkg

**Tipp:** For some errors, like "nvcc not found" after installation, can a reboot be the solution. At least for me it solved 100% of the troubles I had with a fresh installed pycuda in sage. (Sometimes one has really to switch off the machine!)  

**WARNING:** The whole thing is not well tested, use on own risk!

This is only tested in ubuntu 10.04 with nvidia devel drivers (260.40) on an NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT, with CUDA toolkit 3.2.

So more testing is neeeded!

After #10361 lands, the setuptools corruption should be gone. Also, there's an update upstream (pycuda-0.94.2), which fixes some kind of corruption bug for Fermi devices. It would be good to have this update.

I uploaded a package with the new PyCuda version, which holds the change with respect to the update.
There was only one small problem, which could be fixed rather easily: the PyCuda folder contained a folder named src, which leaded to name problems during the installation. Creation of some symbolic links did the trick.

Here thelink of the new package: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.2.spkg
