There is a problem within http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html. It says to use ".. NOTE::" and there is "NOTES:" in the example.

There is also nothing about "TESTS:" section which is often used whithin the source code. 

The recurrent use of ".. blah ::", "::" and "sage: " could also be documented or at least directly point to the corresponding pages of Sphynx doc (even if looking at the examples is of course the best way to go and looking through Sphynx doc also explains many things).

I a bit disagree with the interpretation of "TESTS" directive. I tend to put there any tests that do not really help in illustrating the function.

What's the point of "notes" in lower case? Is it really necessary for something or maybe it is possible to list only `.. NOTES::`?

Thanks a lot for the patch.
I guess with it the situation for newcomers as myself will be much clearer.

I kind of agree with novoselt statement about what EXAMPLES and TESTS blocks should be used for, but don't know what was decided by Sage devs because of the lack of doc before what you just produced.

About the "notes" and "warning" in lower case, they could maybe be mentionned but their use strongly discouraged (e.g. "you'll also find a lot of ".. notes::" in existing source code, which is valid, but the use of the lower case version is strongly discouraged", or "we are currently in the process of converting everything to uppercase").

And also providing the corresponding ticket number (if available) of the ticket for that bug.

This depends on the specific case. But I agree with this comment of yours.

Nod.

Nod. Such code can go in the TESTS block. If there are too many such tests, create a sepatate test file, but don't include them in the reference manual.





> What's the point of "notes" in lower case? Is it really necessary for something or maybe it is possible to list only `.. NOTES::`?

I tend to encourage the use of the Sphinx directive for notes. That is, use the lower-case ".. note::" or the upper-case version ".. NOTE::" (choose one). But Sphinx doesn't recognize ".. notes::" nor ".. NOTES::" (notice the "s" before the double colon). Both the [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html#directives) and the [ReST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#admonitions) documentation say that "notes" with an "s" is not supported.




See my [comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10078#comment:4) at #10078 for reasons why I encourage (but not say "must") the use of upper-case versions of admonitions, etc.

I have checked, and most of this is *much* better in the current developer guide.  However, I think that a little more info about Sphinx and ReST as in this patch would be good, though perhaps not right at the start of that part!

Nathann, since you've been looking at documentation recently, do you have any opinion about this?

Well, as Karl-Dieter said Minh's point about `Notes/Tests` has been solved already. As for explaining the syntax of `::` and `sage:` I do not know the doc sufficiently well to know where it should be done. I am not too worried about that, given that as Minh said people will learn that through looking at sources (and all examples from the manual that use this syntax already).

Minh is always right anyway.

P.S.: If you have some time for a couple of reviews, I have two very short tickets that only move stuff around: #17614 and #17615
