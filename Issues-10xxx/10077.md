Sage coding convention encourages to use ".. WARNING::" rather than ".. warning::", however, using search_src shows the converse is done :

```
sage: len(search_src(".. warning::", interact=False).splitlines())
209
sage: len(search_src(".. WARNING::", interact=False).splitlines())
34
```

This situation is unfortunate. It's reminiscent of the time when many of the coding and documentation conventions were fully fleshed out or adopted. Thank you for spotting this!

I'm the guilty person who encourages the use of "WARNING". That's because I consider it to be a section title, just as "INPUT" is the title of the section for input, "OUTPUT" the title for the section on output, "EXAMPLES" for the title of the section on example usage, etc. I have been very careful in my use of words when I edited the [documentation conventions](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx) in the Developer's Guide.

The problem is that they aren't section titles, and section titles are Sphinx directives.  I think that they should be separate things.  The directives don't get rendered as such.  One might ask, why we have  `EXAMPLES::` instead of `... EXAMPLES::`.  I think it's more clear to leave the directives as lower-cases and keep the section haedings as their own things.

I guess we could just have ".. examples::" print "EXAMPLES:", and similarly for ".. tests::" and that would be the end of it.  On the other hand, if we could actually have these directives include all of the examples and interspersed text, then we could, for example, decide to omit the tests by passing a command-line option when building the docs.  But I don't know how directives work well enough to know if this could be implemented in an easy-to-use way.

See the [sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_directive) and [docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/rst-directives.html) docs for information on creating directives.  I haven't looked at these in any detail.

I'm fine with using either the lower- or upper-case version. I see your argument about sticking to Sphinx's convention on using lower-case for directives. The relevant sections of the Developer's Guide need to be changed to mention that Sphinx's lower-case convention is preferred. And a note saying that Sphinx also accepts the upper-case version.
