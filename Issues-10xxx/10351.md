        builder.close()
        # list of languages
        lang = []

Thanks!  I've solved the problem with

```
sys.path = oldpath + [os.path.join(ROOT, 'devel', 'sage', 'doc', 'common')]
```

Well, importing the whole file could have very strange side-effects, at least in the future.

Another reason is users are likely to edit (just) these options. (Which however is sub-optimal by itself...)
