The following code from `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` is horrible:

```
        # check if any documentation is missing.  first read the start
        # of SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py to find list
        # of languages, documents, and documents to omit
        doc_path = os.path.join(ROOT, 'devel', 'sage', 'doc')
        builder = open(os.path.join(doc_path, 'common', 'builder.py'))
        s = builder.read()[:1000]
        builder.close()
        # list of languages
        lang = []
        idx = s.find("LANGUAGES")
        if idx != -1:
            start = s[idx:].find('[')
            end =  s[idx:].find(']')
            if start != -1 and end != -1:
                lang = s[idx+start+1:idx+end].translate(None, "'\" ").split(",")
        # documents in SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/LANG/ to omit

Thanks!  I've solved the problem with

```
sys.path = oldpath + [os.path.join(ROOT, 'devel', 'sage', 'doc', 'common')]

Well, importing the whole file could have very strange side-effects, at least in the future.
