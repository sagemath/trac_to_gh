What's up with this ticket?  It was merged in sage-4.6.2.alpha2 and worked fine on the buildbot.

I'm going to unmerge this in sage-4.6.2.alpha4 until this is sorted out.

FWIW, I applied this to 4.7.alpha1 with a single (easy-to-fix) hunk failure.  I could post a rebase if that is desirable.

Passed all tests in sage/groups, and in particular I did not see the "random element" failure noted above (64-bit Ubuntu).

On 4.7.rc0.

1)  3 hunk failures when applying `trac_10334-permgroup_cleanup-rebase-mh.patch`, a rebase is attached.

2) With rebase a quotient group fails in a doctest.  Here's the evidence:

Clean 4.7.rc0:

```
G = DihedralGroup(20)
C = G.commutator()
Q = G.quotient(C)
Q.is_abelian()
```

4.7.rc0 with rebased patch:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: Q = G.quotient(C)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forgot some details above.

On clean 4.7.rc0 the "is_abelian" returns {{{True}}.  This is a doctest that has been passing in alpha testing.

On patched version, the commutator is a subgroup, and it is normal:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: C.is_subgroup(G)
True
sage: C.is_normal(G)
True
