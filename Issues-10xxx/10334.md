<a id='comment:11'></a>It just needs trac_10334-permgroup_cleanup-mh.patch and trac_10334-permgroup_cleanup-fix-mh.patch to be applied.  The first was already merged in alpha2.

<a id='comment:19'></a>On 4.7.rc0.

1)  3 hunk failures when applying `trac_10334-permgroup_cleanup-rebase-mh.patch`, a rebase is attached.

2) With rebase a quotient group fails in a doctest.  Here's the evidence:

Clean 4.7.rc0:

```
G = DihedralGroup(20)
C = G.commutator()
Q = G.quotient(C)
Q.is_abelian()
```

4.7.rc0 with rebased patch:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: Q = G.quotient(C)

<a id='comment:20'></a>Forgot some details above.

On clean 4.7.rc0 the "is_abelian" returns {{{True}}.  This is a doctest that has been passing in alpha testing.

On patched version, the commutator is a subgroup, and it is normal:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: C.is_subgroup(G)
True
sage: C.is_normal(G)
