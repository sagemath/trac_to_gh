Works fine now! I can't reproduce François' doctest failure. He doesn't indicate if it is on a supported platform. We should go ahead and merge this one as it apparently works on the buildbot machines.

What's up with this ticket?  It was merged in sage-4.6.2.alpha2 and worked fine on the buildbot.

I'm going to unmerge this in sage-4.6.2.alpha4 until this is sorted out.

Volker: it is a very bad idea to reopen tickets which are already merged, this will cause major confusion.  At the very least, it should be discussed with the release manager (me in this case).

FWIW, I applied this to 4.7.alpha1 with a single (easy-to-fix) hunk failure.  I could post a rebase if that is desirable.

Passed all tests in sage/groups, and in particular I did not see the "random element" failure noted above (64-bit Ubuntu).

On 4.7.rc0.

1)  3 hunk failures when applying `trac_10334-permgroup_cleanup-rebase-mh.patch`, a rebase is attached.

2) With rebase a quotient group fails in a doctest.  Here's the evidence:

Clean 4.7.rc0:

```
G = DihedralGroup(20)
C = G.commutator()
Q = G.quotient(C)
Q.is_abelian()
```

4.7.rc0 with rebased patch:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: Q = G.quotient(C)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

I've tried to locate the error, with no luck.  My rebase could be at fault, but I've double-checked that as well.

Forgot some details above.

On clean 4.7.rc0 the "is_abelian" returns {{{True}}.  This is a doctest that has been passing in alpha testing.

On patched version, the commutator is a subgroup, and it is normal:

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(20)
sage: C = G.commutator()
sage: C.is_subgroup(G)
True
sage: C.is_normal(G)
True
```
