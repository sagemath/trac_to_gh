I have been missing a function/method in the Graph class that allows you to test whether or not a graph is strongly regular.

A graph is strongly regular, or srg(n,k,l,m) if it is a regular graph on n vertices with degree k, and every two adjacent vertices have l common neighbours and every two non-adjacent vertices have m common neighbours. Examples are PetersenGraph (10,3,0,1), the 5-Cycle (5,2,0,1), the Shrikhande graph (16,6,2,2) with more. For information on strongly regular graphs read on Wikipedia.

I have written a function, with documentation, that tests if a graph is strongly regular. The functions have optional arguments: n,k,l,m,certificate. More on this is to be found in the attached file.

The only thing that needs to be done is testing it and making it into a method of Graph, instead of a function, i.e. remove "g" from its argument list and rename all function calls g.* to this.*

Hope to see this path upstream as soon as possible.

I don't know if I should add a new patch, so I for now, just add a note here that we should use the parameter for is_regular, i.e.

```python
        if k is None:
            if not this.is_regular():
                return False
        else:
            if not this.is_regular(k):
                return False

```

Also, this patch is maybe a bit slower then necessary; We fetch the neighbourhood of a vertex O(nÂ²) times. This is simply because I don't know how to get the neighbourhood of a vertex, i.e. the vertices in its neighbourhood, not the edges it is adjacent to. The neighbourhood could be fetched in the beginning of the function, but I don't know how we deal with this kind of allocating a lot of memory.
