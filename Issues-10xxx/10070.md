```
The heaviside built-in function and the step symbolic method are not the same at zero. 

```
sage: heaviside(0)
heaviside(0)
sage: SR(0).step()
1/2
```
And the documentation seems to indicate that `heaviside` should be undefined (?) at zero, though it's not definitive.  

In addition to reconciling these, we should probably unify notation or something.

<a id='comment:7'></a>the problem is that in many contexts (that is, university courses and books), the heaviside step function is not assigned the value 1/2 at 0, as was the choice in `SR(0).step()`. if seen as a distribution, there is no need for such choice indeed, since this would be a difference by a set of measure 0.

let me mention in passing that a proper class of distributions with some flesh in it would be a (cool!) feature. 

compare to:

- `heaviside` has a similar behaviour to Mathematica's [HeavisideTheta](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/HeavisideTheta.html) function.

- `unit_step` has a similar behaviour to Mathematica's [UnitStep](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/UnitStep.html) function.

in sum, this is to suggest:

- writing "See also" blocks, where it is missing
- allowing the possibility to assign a value to heaviside at 0 (as in sympy)

<a id='comment:8'></a>From the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function), it is mostly a convention choice and depends on the situation. The current behavior actually doesn't allow it to be evaluated at 0:

```
sage: heaviside(0)
heaviside(0)
sage: heaviside(0).n()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: function returned None, expected return value of type sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
```
There seem to be some other differences with step:

```
sage: heaviside(I)
heaviside(I)
sage: SR(I).step()
1
sage: plot(x.step())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: cannot find SFunction in table
```
So both of these approaches might need some work.

ok. i think that it should rather break with: `TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically` (the problem is that currently it returns `None`). also in the help it should be clear that the value at 0 can be specified ad-hoc via an additional argument (as in sympy).

intereseting, i didn't yet understand how to "add new functions to the SFunction table", hints welcome. for instance, `plot(x.abs())` does work, as well as a couple of other Pynac functions at `/libs/pynac/pynac.pyd`. however, in that file there exist all `g_step`, `step_serial` and `py_step` entries.

the module [piecewise.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/functions/piecewise.py) is using `from sage.ext.fast_callable import ExpressionTreeBuilder`, maybe this helps? 

heaviside is just `heaviside_piecewise = piecewise([((-oo, 0), 0), ((0, oo), 1)], var=x)`, if 0 is not in the domain

> I would also appreciate any thoughts you had about the Heaviside step function. On a sight tangent, I've been told it is somewhat slow for use in SageManifolds and if there was a way to make it faster (I can cc Eric too for more details).


Creation is not really slow but numerics is:

```
sage: %timeit _=heaviside(x)
The slowest run took 5.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _=heaviside(2.7)
The slowest run took 4.33 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 58.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _=heaviside(ZZ(8))
10000 loops, best of 3: 78.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _=heaviside(QQ(8))
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.5 µs per loop
```
The ZZ and QQ numbers can be easily and well improved by changing `FunctionHeaviside` to a `GinacFunction` and checking for these types in C++ because the GMP functions are available there and Python is not needed. The evalf part still needs Python. I guess this all applies to `unit_step`.

So, is a `step()` separate from `heaviside` and `unit_step` really needed? If not which is it?

thanks! so i tried BuiltinFunction -> GinacFunction in the def of FunctionHeaviside (and at the `init` method), and sage crashes when we do `./sage -br` (compiles but crashes at runtime). why?

then i defined a new `class FunctionHeavisideGinac(GinacFunction):` just calling it `heaviside_ginac`, and then sage doesn't crash and we can use it. i don't have a clue what may be the cause..

Probably because you still had "heaviside" as name argument in the `GinacFunction.__init__` call but I didn't check (note that Pynac matches Pynac functions with Sage functions by name and the name of the only Pynac function of this kind is `step`).

But then nothing is done in C++ so no speedup.

for some people, the fact that heaviside is undefined at 0 is good and expected, because what it really defines is an equivalence class, and it is typically used in the context of [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)). in concrete, linear systems theory (to model a on/off switch) and for differential -> algebraic transformations in physics problems (applications of laplace transform). 

but for other set of users (as in the OP description), this may be confusing, and in many contexts one wouldn't like to talk about equivalence class and the `dirac_delta` (more on this below). 

if i had to change something it would be the derivative operator of `unit_step`: again, one wouldn't like to talk about `dirac_delta` in many contexts because that is a more advanced notion. instead i would give the answer `piecewise([((-oo, 0), 0), ((0, oo), 0)])`, which is nice because 0 is not in  the domain when you ask `f(0)`.. we can also add a message `See heaviside for a generalized notion.`

(*) argument: it's not possible to make a plot, `plot(SR(x).step())`, for such a long time, that i suspect it's not widely used. it should be merged with `unit_step()` or `heaviside()` with value 1/2 at 0. don't have any particular preference, probably the latter.

(note: ..this comment could be more illustrative of different uses (or not) with proper references to books/courses but i don't have time to go into that now :/ )

`step()` timings:

```
sage: %timeit _=SR(1).step()
The slowest run took 11.30 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.77 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _=SR(1/2).step()
The slowest run took 7.51 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.92 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _=SR(1.5).step()
The slowest run took 6.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.21 µs per loop
```

So the Pynac's `step` can be used to speed up `heaviside` and `unit_step`. The procedure would be to rename `step` in Pynac to `unit_step` (adapting the behaviour at 0), and copy the code for `heaviside` in Pynac (again adapting the behaviour at 0), and after that make the Sage functions `GinacFunction`s.

sage: desolve_rk4(x*unit_step(1+x),y,ics=[0,0],end_points=1,step=0.5) # OK
[[0, 0], [0.5, 0.125], [1.0, 0.4999999999999999]]
sage: desolve_rk4(x*heaviside(1+x),y,ics=[0,0],end_points=1,step=0.5) # ??
[[0, 0]]
```
The value at 0 cannot explain such difference because `x` varies in [0,1], so that `1+x>0` and `heaviside(1+x)` should always return `1`.
