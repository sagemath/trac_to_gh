This patch implements the Schuetzenberger involution on both words and tableaux. In addition it generalizes the promotion operator on tableaux to act not only on rectangular tableaux, but tableaux of any shape.

For crystals in the category ClassicalCrystals, the Lusztig involution is implemented and tested in type `A` to give the same result as the Schuetzenberger involution.

A section about the Lusztig involution is added to the thematic tutorial on crystals. A copy of the html documentation built using

```
sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html
```

This already looks very good!

One suggestion I have is to check whether there is an alphabet associated to a given word 'self'. In this case it would be better to use the maximum of the alphabet instead of the maximum of the appearing letters. For example, if you inputted

sage: w=Word([1,2,3],alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5])
sage: w.alphabet()
Ordered Alphabet [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

then you would like the Schuetzenberger involution to return the word
345 instead of 123.

This patch now contains two functions, both of which define the schuetzenberger involution - one that works on the class of words and the other on tableau.

Replying to [@anneschilling](#comment%3A7):


This looks good and all tests pass! One suggestion I have is that it should be possible to pass the alphabet underlying a given tableau for the method schuetzenberger_involution for tableaux. Currently

sage: t = Tableau([[1,1,4],[2]])
sage: t.schuetzenberger_involution()
[[1, 3, 4], [4]]

but if the underlying alphabet is different, the answer would be different.
This would require to change the method to_word in tableau.py.


Also, for words it would be good to add a test that shows that one can have repeated letters:

sage: w = Word([2,1,1,4], alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5,6])
sage: w.schuetzenberger_involution()
word: 3665

Thanks so much for your work on this!

Anne

I just fixed the issues with the Schuetzenberger involution that were still bothering me and also added a new implementation of the promotion operator that can now act on tableaux of any shape.

Hi Anne,

Thanks for the patch! I am happy to review this. The biggest issue I have right now is the name of the function 'has_letter'. I think that a function with that name should just return True or False. I think what I would prefer is for the method 'cells' to include an optional parameter. So, something like the following behavior:

```
    sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[2]])
    sage: t.cells()
    [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
    sage: t.cells(2)
    [(0, 1), (1, 0)]
```

What do you think?

What about:

```
    sage: t.cells_containing(2)
    [(0,1), (1,0)]
```

to not pollute ``cells`` with more logic?

Hi Jason,

You need to apply this patch to the latest version sage-4.7.alpha4, not sage-4.6.2, since there were a couple of crystal patches merged into sage such as #10632 and #10485.

Cheers,

Anne

Hi Anne,

I don't have the latest alpha, but I tested the patch on the sage-combinat queue, as well as looked carefully at the code, and it looks good to me.

Thanks!

Well, I kind of made sage-4.7 "feature-complete" already, so I prefer not to do this.  Normally, it should go into sage-4.7.1.alpha0 in time for Sage Days 30.

Could you remove the following part from the commit message, which doesn't really serve any purpose:

```
A section about the Lusztig involution is added to the thematic tutorial on crystals.
A copy of the html documentation built using

{{{
sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials html
}}}

is available here:

http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/sage/lie/crystals.html

(which might not always be completely up to date).
