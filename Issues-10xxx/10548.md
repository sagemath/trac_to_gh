When I was doing some computations on modular forms, I noticed that the ModularSymbols_clear_cache() was not doing what it claims to do.

```
sage: import gc  
sage: m=ModularSymbols(Gamma1(29),sign=1)
sage: m=[]
sage: ModularSymbols_clear_cache()
sage: gc.collect()
57
sage: [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,sage.modular.modsym.ambient.ModularSymbolsAmbient_wtk_g1)]
[Modular Symbols space of dimension 49 for Gamma_1(29) of weight 2 with sign 1 and over Rational Field]
sage: 
```
So even after garbage collection the modular symbols element is still in memory.

When testing please also make sure that the last stackframe from #10570 is also gone.
