Often, one wants to define a permutation group on a set other than ` {1,2,...,n} ` such as say ` {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'} `.

For example,

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([ [('c','d')], [('a','c')] ])
sage: G.orbit('a')
['a', 'c', 'd']
```

This looks real good, Mike.  I spent some time with this today.  I know its not done yet, but hopefully the following will be helpful.

I applied the patch from sage-combinat for #8359 to 4.7.alpha1, as best I could tell (used patch from http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/rev/508d4942a6d2).  One hunk failure at sage/combinat/root_system/all.py.  Then #10334 had a hunk failure in sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py and #10335 had a had failure in sage/categories/pushout.py.  All easy to fix by hand, and maybe a result of not getting the right thing from the sage-combinat server.

Passed all tests in sage/groups/perm_gps, except two, so not too far off.  Both doctest failures look very minor, and a  result of routines I wrote that have been added recently.

```

I think the stabilizer() routine needs some work.

```
try:
    postition = self._domain_to_gap[point]
except KeyError:
    return self.subgroup(gens=self.gens())
return self.subgroup(gap_group=gap.Stabilizer(self, point))
```

"position" is mis-spelled as first defined, and in the return, I think "point" should be replaced with "position".  With these changes, this seems to work properly with a non-trivial domain in play.

Not a comprehensive look, but hopefully of use.  Let me know what I can do to help (including assisting with documentation).  It'd be nice if there was a patch, or something, at #8359 explaining how best to apply that work.

Hi Mike!

Replying to [nthiery](#comment%3A10):
> For the record: I rebased trac_10335-permgroup_domain-mh.patch on the sage-combinat server on top of #9949


With Rob we are both at Sage days 30, and would love to push permutation groups in. Rob is going to rebase #10334, and I'll finalize the review. #10335 itself needs rebase on 3.4.7, and has quite a few failing doctests, though most look harmless (it's just that the output of permutation groups have changed). Would there be any chance for you to work on this early this week?

Thanks!

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

I ran  `make ptestlong` and got quite a few failures.  I even tried it twice - not sure what is up.

*  Many were in  sage/doc
*  Many were simply the new version of `_repr_` for the symmetric group, and its subgroups
*  The `latex()` method is putting a comma between the cycles within each generator.  Is this desired?

```
return ",".join(["(" + ",".join([latex(x) for x in cycle])+")" for cycle in self.cycle_tuples()])
```
    At a minimum it is causing doctest failures.
* 73 failures in sage/rings/number_field/galois_group.py, likely all the same root cause

Saw these in the patch itself:

* a stray "deprecated_function_alias" in a docstring
* <code>\`\`selfs\`\`</code> in a docstring

Is this a random test ? Is this test really unrandonized (sorry for such a word) ?
I am running a 11.4 Ubuntu up to date on a macbook santa rosa 4,1. I got this faillure both using the sage combinat queue and a separate branch with only 10334 and 10335.

Also, in sage/groups/perm-gps/permgroup.py line 1119, there is still the micro typo : 
postition --> position

Anyway, It is a very very nice work and improvement of permutation groups.

Almost passes all tests on 4.7.1.alpha2 and I get no import problems.

But the German documentation has old `_repr_` behavior.  Aargh.

```

sage -t  -long -force_lib ooks/devel/sage/doc/de/tutorial/interfaces.rst # 1 doctests failed
```

Patch coming up, maybe.

Applied #9378 and the two main patches here.  (I do not understand what "merge if needed" is suppose to mean - so I included that).  Rolled the Russian fixes up with the German fixes into one patch.

Passes all tests in  doc  directory.

Could we *please* review and merge this before anymore new languages surface?  ;-) ;-)

I agree.  But in this case, I agree with David's argument.  This patch implements a highly desirable feature with many doctests.  And if I understand right, GAP uses some probabilistic algorithms, so we could tie ourselves in knots trying to rewrite this doctest.

My understanding (and some grep'ing appears to confirm) is that this is a **new** test.  Would the patch have gone in without it if it had never appeared?  I think so.  If an **existing** test were failing, I'd be a lot less cavalier about dropping it.

Well, to be honest, it's not my problem that this ticket bit-rottened. I started merging tickets "officially" into alpha3 about two weeks ago IIRC (including some you participated in); this ticket got positive review 20 hours ago.

I agree that it's a pity, not just because other already positively reviewed tickets -- three of the other ones you mentioned still need review -- depend on this one, but as I told Rob yesterday, it would have to get rebased anyway, because of (at least) #11749, and I'm not going to back the latter out (or try to reapply it on top of tickets that haven't had positive review recently, again having to manually resolve conflicts and errors, some showing up only later during testing).

We haven't yet talked about the release plans for the final Sage 4.7.2, but I think there'll still be an alpha4 before we go into feature freeze, as there are other important things that still have to get fixed and should be solved in a final.

So IMHO it would be best to wait for the alpha3, hopefully released within the next days, and then rebase this ticket (and if necessary the others) on that.

[I didn't touch the tickets having milestone "sage-pending" (including #11422 and #11598) at all, since I don't know why Jeroen put them there, although I have to admit I also didn't try to find out, mainly because of lack of time. I early did ping the authors and reviewers of all other tickets that were holding up other positively reviewed ones though, with some success.]




W.r.t. the doctest with varying output:

It would IMHO be best to give the alternative, also correct result as an example, too, marking both `# not tested`, with an appropriate comment.

(And perhaps add a real doctest which tests a property common to both.)

Leif - thanks for the help with this one.  With classes starting, I really wasn't in a position to be chasing the evolving alpha, so I had to pass on that offer, but appreciate the willingness.

David - How about the following?

1.  Wait for alpha3 (which sounds big already).

2.  I mark the disputed test `# random`.

3.  I rebase on alpha3 in preparation for alpha4.

4.  You review (2) and (3).

5.  We quickly identify if the tickets in Permutation Group Purgatory needing changes/rebasing.

Lemme know and I'll carve out time to make it happen.

Rob

Great!  We have a plan. Thanks for taking (5).  

Leif and/or Jeroen - feel free to ping us if we need to move quickly on something.

At the ready,

For the impatient, an updated tarball and source tree for upgrading can be found in

 [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha3-prerelease/).

I don't expect further changes to the alpha3 release, except for a few only fixing some doctest errors due to numerical noise below
* `sage/rings/polynomial/` and
* `sage/matrix/`,
and perhaps some clean-up like adding ticket numbers to commit messages lacking them, so it should be safe to (re)base patches on this version.

My build was interrupted (long story) and now two files are giving segfaults when I doctest, with or without the patch.  Don't panic - likely entirely all my fault.  So anyway, I'm starting over and building overnight.  Stay tuned.

That's either due to Linaro, or, more likely, an ATLAS problem, since our version afaik doesn't yet support Sandy Bridge (second generation "Core i").

You could try using your system's ATLAS (may have to install it with your package manager first), by doing:

```sh
$ export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib64/atlas # the directory; usual place on 64-bit Linux
$ rm $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed/atlas-*
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT
$ env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make # or "... make build"
```

The `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes` is important to (really) rebuild all dependent packages as well.

Thanks, Leif.  Ubuntu installs ATLAS into `/usr/lib64/atlas-base`.  Then setting up everything as you describe, suitably adjusted yields:

```

I've asked Volker on the IRC for help. (Perhaps drop in if you can.)

If some libraries are simply in different directories, you could just create symbolic links to them in the `.../atlas-base/` directory. (Although there IMHO should<sup>TM</sup> be a directory containing all; are there some more self-contained ATLAS packages you could install?)





> My Sandy Bridge motherboard is about 8 months old.


That shouldn't matter; Intel's bug just causes a SATA part of the chipset to die earlier.

Whether AVX is available depends on your board (and chipset); if you have on-board graphics, AVX isn't usable.




> Will anybody with a newer chip have to go through a drill like this?


Simon King did successfully build the prerelease on a (Sandy Bridge) Core i3 with Debian x86_64; there only five doctests (in three files) failed due to numerical noise (the same doctests that failed on some other "rare" and older platforms).

I have Sandy Bridge with no on-board graphics.  I have built and tested alpha2 - this is my first problem like this.
