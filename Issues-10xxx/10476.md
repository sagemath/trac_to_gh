Type the following:

```
sage: singular._expect_expr("1")
```
Now type `CTRL-C`.  It takes a very long time before something happens.  This was the cause of #9163 (which was fixed to avoid this issue).

I find that it takes about 5 seconds, not "very long". On a closer look, it actually takes 6 seconds = 20*0.3:

```python
Definition:	singular.interrupt(self, tries=20, timeout=0.29999999999999999, quit_on_fail=True)
Source:
    def interrupt(self, tries=20, timeout=0.3, quit_on_fail=True):
        E = self._expect
        if E is None:
            return True
        success = False
        try:
            for i in range(tries):
                E.sendline(self._quit_string())
                E.sendline(chr(3))
                try:
                    E.expect(self._prompt, timeout=timeout)
                    success= True
                    break
                except (pexpect.TIMEOUT, pexpect.EOF), msg:
                    #print msg
                    pass
        except Exception, msg:
            pass
        if success:
            pass
        elif quit_on_fail:
            self.quit()
        return success
```

* The inherited method `interrupt()` actually tries to quit Singular (`self._quit_string()=="quit"`)
* If quitting did not work the first time, is it going to work the next 19 times?
* From personal experience, I find that actually interrupting (using ctrl-c and "continue") Singular often does not work. Restarting is very fast, though. 

I propose that the Singular pexpect interface override `interrupt()` to be a synonym for `quit()`.

Well, improving the function from working less than 5% of the time to about 95% of the time isn't bad :-)

But you're right that this needs work.  Since I will have to make some more serious changes, let's not do it anymore in sage-5.1.

This is a good estimate of the rate when the issue leads to patchbot false test failures.
But #13237 was fixed 21 months ago, so obviously they too didn't fix it completely.

That should be easy now, since the patch is in 3.1.7 and 3.1.7 is in sage!
I just do not know where this change has to be done.

Following choices for --cntrlc= are possible: a,r,b,c,q :

```
abort after this command(a), abort immediately(r), print backtrace(b), continue(c) or quit Singular(q) ?
```
