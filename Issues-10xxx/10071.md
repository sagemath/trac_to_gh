After #9901 is merged, there are a few held functions which can't evaluate through Maxima or `n()`, I think.  Since this behavior didn't exist at all before, this is ok, but should be rectified.  These would be the methods `csgn`, `step`, and `Order` of symbolic expressions.  See also #10070 for `step`.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This is related to #10034, which is about making it possible for *all* held functions to be evaluated without using Maxima or `n()`.  This ticket, however, is about three held functions which can't even be evaluated with Maxima and `n()`, much less Pynac natively.
