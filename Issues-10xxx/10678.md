There are a few warnings when building the reference manual (`:method:` should be `:meth:`):

```
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
```

Also, it would be nice to make the heading of `sage/sumbolic/function.py` consistent with [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files)
