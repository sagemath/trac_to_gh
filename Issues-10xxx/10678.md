Currently, the documentation for the derivative method of symbolic functions says "see documentation for the global derivative() function for more details", with no hyperlink on the derivative. The attached patch fixes that.

Hmm, I'm not sure about doing this.  I know you said that elsewhere as well.  The problem is that the people (Burcin) who implemented the new stuff are strongly against implied variables.
