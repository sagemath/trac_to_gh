As for matrices, this method conjugates every element of a vector, by appealing to the `conjugate()` method of the base ring.  This is a prelude to a proper inner product for vectors over the complex numbers.

For the record, making a list of new entries and creating a new vector, is much faster than making a copy and changing it in-place.

To the release manager: apply `trac_10536-vector-conjugation-v3.patch` only.

This now depends on #10537, so that sparse vectors behave properly once rebuilt after being manipulated.

Depends on #10537

A block of doctests slipped through without any output.  v3 patch corrects that, and is the only patch necessary to apply.
