With this patch, you can now do:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: x = s[2,2,1]
sage: x.principal_specialization()
-q^4/(q^11 - 2*q^10 + q^8 + 2*q^6 - 2*q^5 - q^3 + 2*q - 1)
sage: x.principal_specialization(n=4)
q^11 + 2*q^10 + 3*q^9 + 4*q^8 + 4*q^7 + 3*q^6 + 2*q^5 + q^4
sage: x.exponential_specialization()
1/24*t^5
sage: x.exponential_specialization(q=QQ["q"].gen())
(q^4/(q^6 + 3*q^5 + 5*q^4 + 6*q^3 + 5*q^2 + 3*q + 1))*t^5
```

Implement  the principal and exponential specializations for symmetric functions as given in Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Section 7.8.

 Unfortunately, the patch currently has several problems:

 1) it seems that always the default code in sf/sfa.py is called, I don't know why
+
 2) I do not know how to give the desired default argument 1 the correct type in exponential_specialization

 3) I guess one should rather implement this for quasi-symmetric functions, but I do not know enough about these currently

 4) the documentation and sensible tests are still missing

Hi Martin,

Thanks submitting this!  A quick response to your points above.  I'm not sure what you mean by point (1)... can you elaborate?

For point (2), you can use None as the default value, and then do

```
    if q is None:
        q = self.parent().base_ring().one()
```
as the first line of your code.

For point (3), quasisymmetric functions are still somewhat immature--in particular they are not in Sage proper. So this is not too big of a concern.

For point (4), yes, there should be more doc and tests.  In particular, I find tests like

```
    all( e[mu].principal_specialization(4) == e[mu].expand(4)(1,q,q^2,q^3) for mu in Partitions(4) )
```
particularly convincing.

Hi Jason!

Many thanks for your quick comments.

1) Using trace I find

```
sage: S = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); s=S.s(); f = s[2,1]
sage: trace("f.principal_specialization()")
> <string>(1)<module>()

ipdb> s
--Call--
> /home/martin/SAGE/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/sf/sfa.py(1653)principal_specialization()
   1652 
-> 1653     def principal_specialization(self, n=infinity, q=var('q')):
   1654         r"""

ipdb> s
> /home/martin/SAGE/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/sf/sfa.py(1681)principal_specialization()
   1680         """
-> 1681         from sage.combinat.sf.sf import SymmetricFunctions
   1682         p = SymmetricFunctions(self.parent().base_ring()).p()

ipdb> 
```
but I was hoping that the principal specialisation from schur.py would be called.

2) Well, currently the actual value of 1 is not used at all (I test q==1 and call principal_specialization without passing q).  So my question really is: some day somebody might implement something where the q is actually used.  Is it better then if the default is None and the doc says, None should always mean one?

Thanks again!

Hi Martin, a few more points:

1) If I'm not mistaken, the function f in the exponential_specialization code for Schur functions is returning the product of the hooks of partition. This can also be done with ` Partition(partition).hook_product(1) `

2) You do not give the result of the test in line 275 of the Schur function code.

3) See [this](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/f5a9c012f6299a9e) and make sure that your patch satisfies these criteria. Please ask the sage-combinat list if you have any questions about these.

I think that this needs to be more compatible with Hall-Littlewood and Macdonald symmetric functions because this seems to be one place that they might be used.  If the base ring already has a q in it, this creates an expression with two q's.

```
sage: Ht = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q,t'].fraction_field()).macdonald().Ht()
sage: Ht[2].principal_specialization()
(q*q + 1)/(q^3 - q^2 - q + 1)
sage: _.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
```
and I think that is wrong.  What about:

```
try:
    q = self.base_ring()('q')
except:
    q = self.base_ring()["q"].fraction_field().gen()
```
Currently in 'powersum.py' you have just the last line.

Also maybe should have doc tests comparing the principal specialization to plethysm.

```
sage: one=f.parent().one()
sage: f.principal_specialization(q=q)==f(one/(1-q)).coefficient([])
True
sage: f.principal_specialization(n=4,q=q)==f(one*(1-q^4)/(1-q)).coefficient([])
True
```

We can treat the symbolic ring as special. What I was think was doing

```python
try:
    if 'q' in self.base_ring().variable_names_recursive():
        raise ValueError("q is already a variable name, so you must give the parameter q")
    else:
        q = self.base_ring()['q'].gen()
except AttributeError:
    q = self.base_ring()['q'].gen()
```
For this, they symbolic ring would be treated the same as `QQ`, and we would get a univariate polynomial ring over `SR`. The other option is just explicitly test for `self.base_ring() is SR` and just let `q = SR.var('q')`.

emails crossed :-)

I think it's OK to require q to be passed explicitely for the symbolic ring.  I would rather not test explicitely for `SR`, because it is quite possible to have, for example and some time in future, a polynomial ring which contains all variables.

Since not all rings have `variable_names_recursive`, I simply try to convert "q" to a ring element, as Mike proposed.

Are you OK with this version?

As long as there is an option to use one of the variables in the ring in case that is what is desired that should be ok.

I just noticed that I overlooked the default values for the exponential specialisation.

I factored out the following little helper function, but I do not know where to put it:

```
def get_variable(ring, name):
    try:
        ring(name)
    except TypeError:
        return ring[name].gen()
    else:
        raise ValueError("the variable %s is in the base ring, pass it explicitly" % name)
```

This could also be used in `theta_qt`:

```
    def theta_qt(self, q=None, t=None):
        r"""
        Return the image of ``self`` under the `q,t`-deformed theta
        endomorphism which sends `p_k` to `\frac{1-q^k}{1-t^k} \cdot p_k`
        for all positive integers `k`.

        In general, this is well-defined outside of the powersum basis only
        if the base ring is a `\QQ`-algebra.

        INPUT:

        - ``q``, ``t`` -- parameters (default: ``None``, in which case 'q'
          and 't' are used)

...

        """
        parent = self.parent()
        BR = parent.base_ring()
        p = parent.realization_of().power()
        p_self = p(self)
        if t is None:
            if hasattr(parent,"t"):
                t = parent.t
            else:
                t = BR(QQ['t'].gen())
        if q is None:
            if hasattr(parent,"q"):
                q = parent.q
            else:
                q = BR(QQ['q'].gen())

```

same in `omega_qt`, `nabla`, `scalar_qt`, `scalar_jack`

<div id="comment:50" align="right">comment:50</div>

I'm still testing this out but here are some initial comments:

"specialisation" -> "specialization"

Also in `exponential_specialization`, I think you should mention "where `n` is the homogeneous degree of `f`."

Are you sure that you intended the behavior with `t=None` and `q=None`?  You get expressions where the `q` and the `t` don't mix well.  This is not what I was expecting (maybe this is what you intended, but I'm asking for clarification).

```
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: h[3].exponential_specialization(t=None,q=None)
((q^2 - 2*q + 1)/(q^2 + q + 1))*t^3
sage: _.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field
```
This is not what is documented under the INPUT section because it says that
"the default is to create the fraction field of polynomials in `t` over the coefficient ring."

Are you sure you don't want to be using `self.base_ring()['q,t'].fraction_field()` `self.base_ring()['t']['q'].fraction_field()` or more simply `SR` for these expressions?  When do you anticipate users wanting to calculate the principal or exponential specialization and what will be done with the expressions afterwards?  

The calculation for elementary, power sum, monomial and Schur are all handled differently and the documentation for the `exponential_specialization` or `principal_specialization` is the same.  I think that the mathematical formulas used in those methods should be documented.

"Note that the stable principal specialization can be obtained as a plethysm" delete the word "stable" since both the stable and non-stable are demonstrated to be plethysm in that example (n=infinity is "stable", right?)

Dear Mike!

thank you for looking into this, and thank you for your comments.  I did the easy ones.

Replying to [@zabrocki](#comment%3A50):

> Also in `exponential_specialization`, I think you should mention "where `n` is the homogeneous degree of `f`."

Could you say precisely where?  Currently, it is written, for example in `sfa.py`, on line 5543:

```
        By analogy `q`-exponential specialization is a ring homomorphism
        defined on homogeneous symmetric functions `f` of degree `n`
        as
```

Or am I misunderstanding you?

> Are you sure that you intended the behavior with `t=None` and `q=None`?  You get expressions where the `q` and the `t` don't mix well.  This is not what I was expecting (maybe this is what you intended, but I'm asking for clarification).

Yes, the documentation is inaccurate, because since a few commits ago it returns a polynomial.
 
> Are you sure you don't want to be using `self.base_ring()['q,t'].fraction_field()` `self.base_ring()['t']['q'].fraction_field()` or more simply `SR` for these expressions?

I don't think it is wise to use `SR` by default, because we always get something polynomial in `t` and rational in `q`.

What I would do with the result afterwards might be factorisation, evaluation at roots of unity, expanding into Taylor series.  In brief: it depends.

What would you expect / like? I admit I don't understand what you mean with "not mixing well".

> The calculation for elementary, power sum, monomial and Schur are all handled differently and the documentation for the `exponential_specialization` or `principal_specialization` is the same.  I think that the mathematical formulas used in those methods should be documented.

I agree that this makes sense.  It is a lot of work, but I'll do it.  It's a shame that I cannot easily inherit the "generic" documentation and append the special stuff.

Thanks again!

I missed that `f` was above because it wasn't mentioned in the formula for `ex_q(h_n)`.  I would suggest moving the "`f` of degree `n`" down a bit since the formula that immediately follows does not refer to `f`, but the one after that does.

Maybe not in `SR`, but what about the other rings?

The reason I ask is exactly because of the applications you want because evaluation at roots of unity and Taylor series are pretty tough when you have the ring as `Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field`.

> What would you expect / like? I admit I don't understand what you mean with "not mixing well".

By "not mixing well" I meant that the expression was a polynomial in `t` with coefficients which are rational functions in `q` and you can't easily access the two generators at the same time and manipulate those sorts of expressions:

```
sage: a=h[3].exponential_specialization(t=None,q=None)
sage: (t,q)=(a.parent().gen(), a.parent().base_ring().gen())
```
Even once you do that, I wasn't able to get a Taylor series or evaluate at roots of unity easily.  I'm guessing that if you know your application, then this would determine what base ring you would be using and the user would put in specific values for `q` and `t`.

> I agree that this makes sense.  It is a lot of work, but I'll do it.  It's a shame that I cannot easily inherit the "generic" documentation and append the special stuff.

Maybe the generic implementation and for either power sum or complete symmetric functions is sufficient?
There will be significant speedup at q=1 for the Schur basis, but I just checked:

```
%time h(s[6,6,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]).exponential_specialization(t=None,q=None)
```
runs about twice as fast as

```
%time s[6,6,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,1].exponential_specialization(t=None,q=None)
```
on my computer.  I would coerce to the complete symmetric functions instead of the power sum.

I made some changes to the documentation, but there was one comment that I have that I have not yet changed.

In the documentation for the exponential specialization it reads "Note that setting `q = 1` in the stable principal specialization is an invalid operation."  This should be documented in principal specialization and this should be followed.  For instance

```
sage: e=SymmetricFunctions(QQ).e()
sage: e[2].principal_specialization(q=1)
+Infinity
sage: (e[2]-e[1,1]).principal_specialization(q=1)
SignError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
That is, I think that you should raise an error in this case.  You can remove the comment from exponential specialization and just put it in principal specialization.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:68\" align=\"right\">comment:68</div>\n\nHi Darij!\n\n* concerning `get_variable`, I see it in `monomial.py` also, line 427.

Hi Darij!

* concerning `get_variable`, I see it in `monomial.py` also, line 427.  Or did I misunderstand?

* concerning division by zero: this problem actually affects all bases. The workaround 
  would be to have q symbolic and then take the limit.  I can think of a few problems, 
  let's first check that they are non-problems:
    - speed for large n and weird coefficient rings
    - less nice output when q is symbolic

* Heuristically, redirecting via the monomial basis seems faster in real life examples 
  than via the powersum basis.  Did you undo this on purpose?

Hi Martin!

* I see `get_variable` defined only 9 times, but there are 6 files and 2 functions in each, so there are probably 3 missing. Sorry if it isn't monomial.py.

* Division by 0 shouldn't affect any basis (in principal_specialization) when n is finite! The definition works just fine, so I think the method should work as well -- which I think it doesn't.

I just checked. No there are none missing.  `get_variable` is not used in `principal_specialization` of `monomial.py` and not used at all in `sfa.py`.

> * Division by 0 shouldn't affect any basis (in principal_specialization) when n is finite! The definition works just fine, so I think the method should work as well -- which I think it doesn't.

This is correct, but, for example in `schur.py` I don't see a better way than actually computing with indeterminate `q` and substituting the value afterwards.  Do you think this is worth it?

Actually, there is some nonsense going on right now, because for q other than 1, the monomial basis redirects to the powersum basis.  In any case, I'll add a comment.

Redirecting to homogeneous instead of powersum in monomial.py has an interesting side effect:

```
    x.principal_specialization(3, q=var("q"))
Expected:
    5*(q^6 - 1)/(q^2 - 1) + 3*(q^3 - 1)/(q - 1) + 1
Got:
    -5*(q^3 - 1)^2/(q - 1)^2 + 3*(q^3 - 1)/(q - 1) + 10*(q^4 - 1)*(q^3 - 1)/((q^2 - 1)*(q - 1)) + 1
```
Do we still want this?  (I am well aware that this is most likely completely arbitrary.) For the record, redirecting to elementary would give

```
    x.principal_specialization(3, q=var("q"))
Expected:
    5*(q^6 - 1)/(q^2 - 1) + 3*(q^3 - 1)/(q - 1) + 1
Got:
    -10*(q^3 - 1)*q/(q - 1) + 5*(q^3 - 1)^2/(q - 1)^2 + 3*(q^3 - 1)/(q - 1) + 1

Actually, I now think that for monomial we should convert to powersum, not to elementary.

If something is nice in the monomial basis, it will also be nice in the powersum basis but not necessarily in the elementary basis, don't you think?

```
