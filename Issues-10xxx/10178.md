If I try to print the html documentation,for example, here:

http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_rings.html

The (blank) sidebar takes up a couple of inches on the left, and the rightmost couple of inches is cut off.

This was reported by Dan Willis.

I don't think it's invalid.  A new user will not know to collapse the sidebar to get sensible printing.  I bet most experienced users wouldn't know that either.

I'll change the title to specify printing without collapsing the sidebar.  In reality, there should be a print stylesheet that hides that sidebar automatically.
