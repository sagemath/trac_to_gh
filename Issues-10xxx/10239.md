When computing the Bessel Y-function, the `Bessel` function calls `bessel_Y` with a default argument of `algorithm='pari'`.  However, `bessel_Y` throws an exception when using anything else than scipy or maxima.


```
sage: f = Bessel(0, typ='Y')
sage: f(1.5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   1084             return bessel_K(nu,z,algorithm=s,prec=p)
   1085         if t == "Y":

--> 940         raise ValueError, "unknown algorithm '%s'"%algorithm
    941     
    942 class Bessel():

ValueError: unknown algorithm 'pari'
```

The following works fine: 

```
sage: f = Bessel(0, typ='Y', algorithm='scipy')
sage: f(1.5)
0.382448923798000
sage: g = Bessel(0, typ='Y', algorithm='maxima')
sage: g(1.5)
0.382448923797759
```

As a first solution, it would be easy to change the calling convention of `bessel_Y` to ensure that maxima or scipy is used.  However, it seems like pari does a better job at computing the Bessel functions, and therefore it might be better in the long run to extend `bessel_Y` to use pari (if at all possible).

Too bad that there's no pari implementation: for Bessel-J it is just so fast:

```
sage: timeit(r"bessel_J(1, 2.3, algorithm='pari')")
625 loops, best of 3: 110 µs per loop
sage: timeit(r"bessel_J(1, 2.3, algorithm='scipy')")
625 loops, best of 3: 480 µs per loop
sage: timeit(r"bessel_J(1, 2.3, algorithm='maxima')")
125 loops, best of 3: 5.27 ms per loop
```

Still, using the maxima implementation would be good for now, as the docs mention that there are some accuracy issues with scipy.  Also, thanks for your quick response -- it feels like I never left Ghent and we are still talking about Sage in the backyard of the department!

The patch seems to work well.  The `Bessel` method now behaves as intended, and the patch also addresses some other inconsistencies in the code (checking the precision for the scipy code, and some documentation issues).   

There is one doctest that fails on my machine (64bit macbook pro, sage 4.6):

```
sage: Bessel(6, algorithm="scipy")(pi)
Expected:
    0.0145459669825000 + 5.34392507678000e-18*I
Got:
    0.0145459669825000 + 5.34410157169000e-18*I
```

This looks like inevitable round-off error in the complex part.  Can we hit this doctest with the `#random` tag or is there a more subtle way of dealing with this?  IMHO, this is also a bug in scipy: for real input, the Bessel functions of the first and second kind should be exactly real, not up to some small complex drift.  This will cause all sorts of problems with plotting, etc.

The problem with scipy is the way in which the argument is presented to the Bessel function: when the argument is real, scipy returns a real value for the Bessel function: 

```
sage: import scipy.special
sage: scipy.special.jv(6, complex(float(pi)))
(0.014545966982505558+5.3441015716885544e-18j)
sage: scipy.special.jv(6, float(pi))
0.014545966982505555
```

For now I would suggest adding an ellipsis to the doctest to obscure the complex part (e.g write the output as `0.0145459669825000...`).  I've modified the patch to take this into account.

As everything else works fine, I would change the status to positive review but I want to hear your opinion about the modification first.
