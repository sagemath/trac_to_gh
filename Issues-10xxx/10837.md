With a more specific norm now defined for vectors and matrices over CDF/RDF, the computation might conceivably differ from the more generic implementation provided in `matrix2.pyx`.  Just one test failure though, and I'm not sure how to fix it up.

Volker,  Marshall?  Any ideas?

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Minor nitpick (really minor): "if not p in [-2,-1,1,2]:" reads better as "if p not in [-2,-1,1,2]:", I think.

In the doctests for norm, shouldn't "Return values are in `RDF`. " be followed by a double-colon?

In the OUTPUT docs for the vector norm: "Returned values is a double precision" --> values should be the singular "value".  Also, "(or an integer when ``p=0``." is missing a closing parenthesis.

I've read through the patch and am testing the patch now, so if you attach corrections, please submit them as a separate patch.

Hi Jason,

Thanks for the look and the nits.  I'll tidy up in the morning, I'm about to call it a day.

The `matrix2.pyx` failures are from replacing `CDF` by `RR`, not `CC`.  I'd swear those had been tested.

Yes, lots of new stuff in 4.6.2.rc0, including `is_singular()`.  See the table at http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/LatexToWorksheet

Perhaps list the methods here for ease of maintainance later on.

2) In your documentation on condition() and norm() you're missing an 'n' in the word 'column' for the -Infinity norm case. Line 582 of sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx:

```
        - ``p = Infinity`` or ``p = oo``: the maximum row sum.                                                    
        - ``p = -Infinity`` or ``p = -oo``: the minimum colum sum.                                                
        - ``p = 1``: the maximum column sum. 
```

3) Line 705 of sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx:

```
    if numpy is None:
        import numpy
    import sage.rings.infinity
    import sage.rings.integer
    import sage.rings.real_double
```
By convention, shouldn't import commands be listed at the top of a file?

4) The same again as above for the norm() code for matrices and vectors you've added.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the review.  Responses below:

> 1) Line 530 of sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx:

<snip>
> Perhaps list the methods here for ease of maintainance later on.

Take a look at sage/matrix/docs.py.  This stuff comes from there and is a list of things you have to do in order for matrices to "work".  So it seems to be used as a check-list more than a list of what is available.

> 2) In your documentation on condition() and norm() you're missing an 'n' in the word 'column' for the -Infinity norm case.

Good catch - I rolled this into a version 3 of the "edits" patch.

> 3) Line 705 of sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx:

At the top of the file, then the import happens at start-up, which adds to the (noticeable) delay.  You can import anywhere, this is an attempt to delay it until it is needed.  `numpy` should be a variable, with module scope, so the conditional will mean the import only happens once (but I suspect it is not strictly necessary), which you will see throughout this file in other methods.

<div id="comment:29" align="right">Comment 29</div>

I was going to fix the doctests and the 0-norm for the vectors. But have a look at the condition of A in your doctests! The -oo condition is 17.5, but clearly the minimal sum over rows is 9! This is not an issue of the wrapper, but numpy gives the same result. Do you have any explanation at hand?

One thing: Is there any particular reason why you didn't include the usual condition, given as the quotient of the minimal and the maximal sv? This works for nonsquare matrices as well and is thus very important to have.

Hi Martin,

Somehow missed the singular value option in the NumPy docs.  Thanks for catching that and enabling it!

All the changes and additions look good to me.  The one test in the "review2" patch has a comment symbol in front of the `all()`.  If that is removed, the test passes (with result `True`).  Did you intend to remove the comment symbol?

If so, just let me know and I can fix it and get this ticket marked positive review and all ready to go.

Thanks,
Rob

<div id="comment:33" align="right">Comment 33</div>

I took out the comment symbol to restore the test, and have combined the two reviewer tickets, since they need a user string (added Martin in on that).  Enabling the 'sv' option is a significant addition, so I have added Martin as an author (and myself as the reviewer of that).

Passes all long tests, so as proposed, I have switched this to 'positive' review.  Thanks for the help on this on, Martin and Simon.
