`sage -upgrade` should not forcibly merge the local working directory with upstream files when installing updated SPKGs of the four main tracked repositories of the sage distribution.

It's generally a bad idea because, as I see it, the current workflow of sage development involves using Mercurial mainly 1) to string together patches to make releases, and 2) to create patches to upload to trac. Even if `sage -upgrade` merges local changes into the tree, those changes will never make it into the main sage distribution unless we dig them out and put them in a patch, which anyway involves unmerging of some sort.

More practically speaking, this merging behavior also currently causes `sage -upgrade` to fail when attempting to upgrade from one alpha version of sage to another, which is a pain since the sage distribution is both relatively large and slow to build from scratch.

Since alphas are currently released based on the previous stable release rather than the previous alpha, there could also be an option (maybe even a default) to strip the old alpha's branch from the stable version after installing the new alpha, or even automatically rebasing local changes. There is a general procedure I currently follow to move all my patches from old alphas to new alphas which could probably be automated as well.

I marked this as a defect as I think it seems reasonable to expect `sage -upgrade` to be able to do stuff like this (or at least be usable for upgrading between alphas), but if you disagree, feel free to change it to a feature request.
