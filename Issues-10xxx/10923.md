Here is the problem (tested on 4.6.2) :

```
sage: i = integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
sage: i.numerical_approx()          
-0.0890738558907803
```

This should be a positive number since the map is positive.

This is probably a bug in Maxima. 

```
sage: integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
-1/2*gamma(-1/2, 1)
sage: integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1).n()
-0.0890738558907803
sage: n(1/2*gamma(-1/2,1))
0.0890738558907803
sage: numerical_integral(e^(-1/x^2),0,1)
(0.08907385589078036, 1.4474177932169952e-15)
```
So probably a minus sign got in there somehow.

This is now Maxima bug 3211937.

We should probably test both, though of course this is not as pretty.

I can verify that the issue is solved after building the maxima-5.24 spkg that Michael provided and then applying the patch [attachment:sage-trac_10923.patch]. 

```
sage: i = integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
sage: i.numerical_approx()
0.0890738558907802
```

Doctests in the affected file all pass. I'm running all tests now, but  pending that, I give the ticket a positive review.
