Here is the problem (tested on 4.6.2) :

```
sage: i = integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
sage: i.numerical_approx()          
-0.0890738558907803
```

This should be a positive number since the map is positive.

This is probably a bug in Maxima. 

```
sage: integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
-1/2*gamma(-1/2, 1)
sage: integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1).n()
-0.0890738558907803
sage: n(1/2*gamma(-1/2,1))
0.0890738558907803
sage: numerical_integral(e^(-1/x^2),0,1)
(0.08907385589078036, 1.4474177932169952e-15)
```
So probably a minus sign got in there somehow.

This is now Maxima bug 3211937.

We don't get such a nice answer, anyway, so the doctest from the patch would fail. With maxima-5.24,

```
sage: integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1).full_simplify()
((e*erf(1) - e)*sqrt(pi) + 1)*e^(-1)

I can update the patch; should we test that the numerical approximation is close to what it should be, or should we check for the symbolic result?

We should probably test both, though of course this is not as pretty.

I can verify that the issue is solved after building the maxima-5.24 spkg that Michael provided and then applying the patch [attachment: sage-trac_10923.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10923/sage-trac_10923.patch.gz). 

```
sage: i = integral(e^(-1/x^2),x,0,1)
sage: i.numerical_approx()
0.0890738558907802
```

Doctests in the affected file all pass. I'm running all tests now, but  pending that, I give the ticket a positive review.
