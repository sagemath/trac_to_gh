If you try to hash a mutable sequence, Sage complains that immutable sequences are unhashable..

```
sage: a = Sequence([1,2,3])
sage: hash(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/Applications/sage_devel/<ipython console> in <module>()

/Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/sequence.pyc in __hash__(self)
    517         """
    518         if not self._is_immutable:
--> 519             raise ValueError, "immutable sequences are unhashable"
    520         if self.__hash is None:
    521             self.__hash = hash(tuple(self))

ValueError: immutable sequences are unhashable
```

which is backwards; immutable sequences are the only ones that are hashable.

Sorry, positive review was a bit too fast.

Could you change syntax of

```
raise ValueError, "mutable sequences are unhashable"
```
to

```
raise ValueError("mutable sequences are unhashable")
```
So we don't have to do it when porting sage to python3.

Done, but since 2to3 handles this automatically, I'd've thought it made more sense to leave these alone until then.

I've also added an email address.  I won't throw anyone under the bus, but I didn't conclude that names were mandatory while email addresses were merely preferred on my own. `:-)`
