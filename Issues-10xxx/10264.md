The following test from `sage/interfaces/r.py` breaks when `$TMPDIR` (by default `/tmp`) is a symbolic link:

```
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: import tempfile
            sage: tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
            sage: r.chdir(tmpdir)

        On Linux, we could use ``tmpdir == sageobj(r.getwd())``
        to test this, but Mac prepends ``/private/`` to such
        directories, so we check that the directory name string
        is in the working directory string instead::

            sage: tmpdir in sageobj(r.getwd())
            True
```

Tested on Linux with

```
$ sudo ln -s /tmp /special
$ env TMPDIR=/special sage -t sage/interfaces/r.py
```

Tested on OS X 10.4 (where `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp`) with

```
$ sage -t sage/interfaces/r.py
```
