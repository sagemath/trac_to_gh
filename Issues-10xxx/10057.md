Upgrade to the latest version of sagenb.  Tarball for `upstream/` at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/sagenb-0.11.2.tar

One useful fix is the fixing of various import locations: [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/280](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/280)
We deprecate for real all these fixed `sagenb` imports in #17460.

This will also fix #11275, #8738, #8427, #17490.

See also #17482 and #17515 for Sage issues related to this update.

I started to review that ticket, but I'm puzzled since

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import decorator_defaults
```
still works. Shouldn't it fail?

Also, shouldn't the patch include a doctest?

The reason it doesn't fail is because sage.misc.misc contains an import statement, importing decorator_defaults among other (line 2735). This was introduced in #9907 for backwards compatibility, in case users assumed that these decorators would still be in sage.misc.misc. I assumed this would be a temporary thing, just as for keyword and attribute changes. #9907 was merged 14 months ago, so this is longer than the deprecation lifetime, but on the other hand, no deprecation warning has been issued to users doing the wrong thing for these past 14 months. I'm not sure what is usually done under such circumstances. Also, removing the import statement from sage.misc.misc will result in the pickle jar breaking, and I'm not sure how to remedy that and what consequences it might have. Need expert opinion here.

Maybe that's just me, but isn't it a bit too much including a doctest just for a relocation of a function? It's still the same function.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Okay.  Now if you can at least look at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/282 for me (since you already have a working sagenb development environment) I would be grateful.  Given its importance, I'd also appreciate a look at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/267 but I know that one requires just slightly more testing, though in reality both patches are fairly trivial.

Yes, but easier said than done.  I won't have time for this today, and I'm a little hazy on exactly how all the dependencies for sagenb might get properly imported from Sage itself.

It would also be nice if upstream were responsive at all to their many pull requests (this seems to be the case for several projects pocoo has "taken over").
