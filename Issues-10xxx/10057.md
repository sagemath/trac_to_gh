Upgrade to the latest version of sagenb.  Tarball for `upstream/` at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/sagenb-0.11.2.tar

One useful fix is the fixing of various import locations: [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/280](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/280)
We deprecate for real all these fixed `sagenb` imports in #17460.

This will also fix #11275, #8738, #8427, #17490.

See also #17482 and #17515 for Sage issues related to this update.

Mike,

I started to review that ticket, but I'm puzzled since

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import decorator_defaults
```
still works. Shouldn't it fail?

Also, shouldn't the patch include a doctest?

The reason it doesn't fail is because sage.misc.misc contains an import statement, importing decorator_defaults among other (line 2735). This was introduced in #9907 for backwards compatibility, in case users assumed that these decorators would still be in sage.misc.misc. I assumed this would be a temporary thing, just as for keyword and attribute changes. #9907 was merged 14 months ago, so this is longer than the deprecation lifetime, but on the other hand, no deprecation warning has been issued to users doing the wrong thing for these past 14 months. I'm not sure what is usually done under such circumstances. Also, removing the import statement from sage.misc.misc will result in the pickle jar breaking, and I'm not sure how to remedy that and what consequences it might have. Need expert opinion here.

> Also, shouldn't the patch include a doctest?

Maybe that's just me, but isn't it a bit too much including a doctest just for a relocation of a function? It's still the same function.

Yes, I was sloppy. To be more precise: running the doctests with sagenb-0.11.1 didn't import the `babel` package.

To patch `babel`: it's probably best to remove `babel` from `sagenb` and install it like a normal package (this should really be done for all packages inside `sagenb`).

Yes, but easier said than done.  I won't have time for this today, and I'm a little hazy on exactly how all the dependencies for sagenb might get properly imported from Sage itself.
