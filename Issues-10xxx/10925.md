This seems really complicated.  Would it be easier to just do 

```
try:
    if len(headpoint) !=  len(tail point):
        stuff
    elif
except TypeError # kind of error when you ask for len of something that doesn't have it
    make into lists like you do
```
I get what this code is doing but I'm afraid it's going to be hard to maintain.  I don't know how much of an efficiency gain your solution might be, though, or maybe there are too many cases anyway no matter how you do it.

What do you think?  By the way, it needs doctests of the "bad" cases (there should be examples of traceback doctesting in nearby code, I think, for sure elsewhere in the plot modules).   Thanks for working on this, it's close!
