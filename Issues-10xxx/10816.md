There is the following example in the documentation in `schemes\generic\projective_space.py`:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
sage: X = A.subscheme([x*z^2, y^2*z, x*y^2]); X
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:
  x*z^2,
  y^2*z,
  x*y^2
```
The file passes tests fine in sage-4.6.2.rc0, I can also do it from the command line. But if I try to do it in the notebook, I get

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_4.py", line 10, in <module>
    exec compile(u'open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n" + _support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("QS48eCx5LHo+ID0gUHJvamVjdGl2ZVNwYWNlKDIsIFFRKQpYID0gQS5zdWJzY2hlbWUoW3gqel4yLCB5XjIqeiwgeCp5XjJdKTsgWA=="),globals())+"\\n"); execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpgPYl3N/___code___.py", line 4, in <module>
    exec compile(u'X = A.subscheme([x*z**_sage_const_2 , y**_sage_const_2 *z, x*y**_sage_const_2 ]); X
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/home/novoselt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/generic/projective_space.py", line 501, in subscheme
    return algebraic_scheme.AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective(self, X)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective'
```
which I don't understand.

Everything is good in the notebook in sage-4.6, so it should been broken recently, perhaps by #10525, although I can't imagine how.

Maybe, but I don't see what is wrong with those imports.

What bugs me most is that it works from the command line, but not in the notebook, so there is probably a bug in the notebook, but I have no idea how to trace it.
