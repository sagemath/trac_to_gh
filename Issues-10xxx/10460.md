We used to have:

```
sage: F = QQ['t'].construction()[0]
sage: G = loads(dumps(F))
sage: G == F
True
sage: G.domain() == F.domain()
False
sage: G.codomain() is None
True
```

In other words, the cdef'd attributes of the construction functor are lost.

I created a generic pickling method for functors, so that it works a lot better:

```
sage: F = QQ['t'].construction()[0]
sage: G = loads(dumps(F))
sage: G == F
True
sage: G.domain() == F.domain()
True
sage: G.codomain() is None
False
```

The patch contains two tests, showing that the problem is solved.

To the patchbot / release manager:

Depends on #8800

So, in fact, it also depends on #8807 and #10318.

Up to now, I only tested sage/categories/functor.pyx and sage/categories/pushout.py. However, since they use functors intensely, I am already marking the ticket as "needs review".

Since the patchbot complained, I updated the patch. It should cleanly apply to `sage-4.6.2.alpha0`.

It turns out that the patch does in fact *not* depend on #8800. It only depends on #8807 and #10318, which are already merged. So, no dependency.

Since the patchbot did not try to apply the patch again and since the patch cleanly applies to sage-4.6.1.alpha4, I now try to trigger another attempt of the patchbot by posting a new copy of the patch.

And, by the way, this rather simple patch still needs review...
