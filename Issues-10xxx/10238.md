```
sage: p = Polyhedron()
sage: p
The empty polyhedron in QQ^0.
sage: p.contains(0)
True
sage: p.contains(1)
True
sage: p.contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.contains([(0, 1)])
True
sage: p.interior_contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.relative_interior_contains([0, 1])
True
```

I think all of the above should return False.

I changed the "empty" polyhedron to contain one equation `0==-1`. I also modified the "contains" checks to be slightly more general and work with points whose coordinates are not necessarily in the same field as the polyhedron.

This seems reasonable, but it shows in the doctest as "[An equation () x + -1 == 0]" which is confusing: what is "() x" and why "+ -"?

This is not directly related to this ticket, but how about omitting "() x +" for 0-dimensional equations/inequalities and taking into account the "+ -" situation in general?

Patch order issues:

```
applying trac_10238_containment_check_for_empty_polyhedra.patch
patching file sage/geometry/polyhedra.py
Hunk #8 succeeded at 4208 with fuzz 2 (offset 446 lines).
now at: trac_10238_containment_check_for_empty_polyhedra.patch

(Tested on top of face lattice.)

I am fine with this version, but just to make sure: you really want to start the line with "+" if there are no variables and have space between the sign and the coefficient only if there are variables?

I rearranged the patches an in #9604, should apply cleanly now.

My preferred prettyprinting is

```
  An equation (-1) x + 1 >= 0
  An equation (2) x - 1 >= 0
  An equation 1 == 0
  An equation -1 == 0
```
and I fixed the 3rd one in the patch.
