```
sage: p = Polyhedron()
sage: p
The empty polyhedron in QQ^0.
sage: p.contains(0)
True
sage: p.contains(1)
True
sage: p.contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.contains([(0, 1)])
True
sage: p.interior_contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.relative_interior_contains([0, 1])
True
```

I think all of the above should return False.

I changed the "empty" polyhedron to contain one equation `0==-1`. I also modified the "contains" checks to be slightly more general and work with points whose coordinates are not necessarily in the same field as the polyhedron.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A1):
> I changed the "empty" polyhedron to contain one equation `0==-1`.


This seems reasonable, but it shows in the doctest as "[An equation () x + -1 == 0]" which is confusing: what is "() x" and why "+ -"?

This is not directly related to this ticket, but how about omitting "() x +" for 0-dimensional equations/inequalities and taking into account the "+ -" situation in general?

I guess this ticket is as good as any other to fix the string '_repr_()' of (in)equalities :-)  The updated patch skips "zero coefficient times x" and handles the sign of the constant term nicer.

Patch order issues:

```
applying trac_10238_containment_check_for_empty_polyhedra.patch
patching file sage/geometry/polyhedra.py
Hunk #8 succeeded at 4208 with fuzz 2 (offset 446 lines).
now at: trac_10238_containment_check_for_empty_polyhedra.patch
```
(Tested on top of face lattice.)

I am fine with this version, but just to make sure: you really want to start the line with "+" if there are no variables and have space between the sign and the coefficient only if there are variables?

I rearranged the patches an in #9604, should apply cleanly now.

My preferred prettyprinting is

```
  An equation (-1) x + 1 >= 0
  An equation (2) x - 1 >= 0
  An equation 1 == 0
  An equation -1 == 0
```
and I fixed the 3rd one in the patch.
