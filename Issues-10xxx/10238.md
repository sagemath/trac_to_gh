```
sage: p = Polyhedron()
sage: p
The empty polyhedron in QQ^0.
sage: p.contains(0)
True
sage: p.contains(1)
True
sage: p.contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.contains([(0, 1)])
True
sage: p.interior_contains([0, 1])
True
sage: p.relative_interior_contains([0, 1])
True
```

I think all of the above should return False.

I changed the "empty" polyhedron to contain one equation `0==-1`. I also modified the "contains" checks to be slightly more general and work with points whose coordinates are not necessarily in the same field as the polyhedron.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:1):
> I changed the "empty" polyhedron to contain one equation `0==-1`.

This seems reasonable, but it shows in the doctest as "[An equation () x + -1 == 0]" which is confusing: what is "() x" and why "+ -"?

This is not directly related to this ticket, but how about omitting "() x +" for 0-dimensional equations/inequalities and taking into account the "+ -" situation in general?

I rearranged the patches an in #9604, should apply cleanly now.

My preferred prettyprinting is

```
  An equation (-1) x + 1 >= 0
  An equation (2) x - 1 >= 0
  An equation 1 == 0
  An equation -1 == 0
```
and I fixed the 3rd one in the patch.
