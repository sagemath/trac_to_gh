Note that this works properly for rationals:

```
sage: int(2)**(3/2)
2*sqrt(2)
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
```
Also, this thing is likely to happen in list comprehensions using `range()`, since that returns Python ints. Right now, this doesn't work as expected:

```
[n^(1.5) for n in range(10)]
```
