Reorganization of -help and -advanced looks real good!  I prefer the topical organization versus the alphabetical listing.  Some comments, questions, suggestions to consider.

1. The change in the banner listing means the notice about being a "prerelease" version is no longer included in the help output.  Was this intended?  Unpatched:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.6.1.alpha2, Release Date: 2010-11-21                |
* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Patched:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.6.1.alpha2, Release Date: 2010-11-21                |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

2.  On help for running the notebook, I would use "for" rather than "to"

```
(options are the same as to the notebook command in Sage)
```

3.  There are tests to see if various packages/add-ons are installed and no help is given of they are not available.  I think I would prefer to see **all** available options and then a message saying when an add-on is not avaailable.  This way people could see what is possible and install the add-ons if they want them.  So, for example, suppose `kash` is not installed, then maybe output could be something like:

```
-kash [...]         -- run Sage's Kash with given arguments
                    (not installed currently, run  sage -i kash)
```


4.  Applied in local/bin on 4.6.1.alpha2 and got 1 failure.  Didn't really investigate any further.  And I just now see I failed to notice the dependency on #10300 (and precursors), so likely that is the cause.

Suggested changes look real good as implemented - thanks.

Applied all the dependencies and everything applies and runs smoothly.  All new tests pass with:

```
sage -t sage/tests/cmdline.py
```

Help commands work properly and like I said before, I like the reorganization.  The scripting looks good to my eye, but if somebody more experienced wants to take a look, that wouldn't hurt.  This was advertised on sage-devel and has been available for several days.  I'm going to give this a positive review, and maybe it can sit like that for a day or two before being merged?

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>\nIn any case an improvement, but still room for more... ;-)\n\n* For educational purposes, what about listing the long options with double-dash [only]? (I don't think we have to mention that Sage also currently supports long options with just a single dash.)\n\n* What about using \"here\" documents rather than cascades of `echo`s? (Perhaps more than one per `usage()` though.)\n\n* What about using the shell's pattern matching for option parsing? (This is more readable, avoids problems with potentially broken `test`s, and is in some cases less redundant.)\n\n  * I would list \"coverage\" under \"testing\", not \"documentation\".\n\n  * We could support `sage -h <topic>` or alike (`sage help <topic|option>`).\n\n\nThere are some flaws or omissions (can't list them all here, just a few):\n* `s/debuging/debugging/`\n* `-clone` doesn't \"run\" the new branch.\n* `-b` without a branch (re)builds the current. (And `-b main` switches back to the \"original\", hopefully unmodified...)\n* `-s` is also valid in conjunction with `-f` (but only as the second argument, like with `-i`).\n* If you run `sage` with a file given, the extension is mandatory, and you can also pass further arguments to it (ending up in `sys.argv`), so the usage is\n\n```\n    sage filename.{sage, py, spyx} [arguments]\n```\n    or\n\n```\n    sage filename.<sage|py|spyx> [arguments]\n```\n* `-update` and `-update-build` are obsolete, or at least currently unsupported.\n* `-t` etc. also takes the additional options `-force_lib` and `-sagenb`.\n* `-testall` also takes additional options, like e.g. `-long`.\n* ...

In any case an improvement, but still room for more... ;-)

* For educational purposes, what about listing the long options with double-dash [only]? (I don't think we have to mention that Sage also currently supports long options with just a single dash.)

* What about using "here" documents rather than cascades of `echo`s? (Perhaps more than one per `usage()` though.)

* What about using the shell's pattern matching for option parsing? (This is more readable, avoids problems with potentially broken `test`s, and is in some cases less redundant.)

  * I would list "coverage" under "testing", not "documentation".

  * We could support `sage -h <topic>` or alike (`sage help <topic|option>`).


There are some flaws or omissions (can't list them all here, just a few):
* `s/debuging/debugging/`
* `-clone` doesn't "run" the new branch.
* `-b` without a branch (re)builds the current. (And `-b main` switches back to the "original", hopefully unmodified...)
* `-s` is also valid in conjunction with `-f` (but only as the second argument, like with `-i`).
* If you run `sage` with a file given, the extension is mandatory, and you can also pass further arguments to it (ending up in `sys.argv`), so the usage is

```
    sage filename.{sage, py, spyx} [arguments]
```
    or

```
    sage filename.<sage|py|spyx> [arguments]
```
* `-update` and `-update-build` are obsolete, or at least currently unsupported.
* `-t` etc. also takes the additional options `-force_lib` and `-sagenb`.
* `-testall` also takes additional options, like e.g. `-long`.
* ... (I don't recall... ;-) )

> While I have your attention here on-topic - is it possible to do  -testall  in combination with something like  -tp 4 ?  I'm always looking to do this when reviewing.  I can't see from the code that it is possible.

`sage -testall` currently doesn't support multiple threads, since there's no separate option to specify the number, just the combined option `-tp`, which excludes `-testall`.

But you could (from `SAGE_ROOT`) run `make ptest NUM_THREADS=4` (**not** `ptestall`, which includes `--optional`), which is perhaps less convenient since you have to `cd` to `SAGE_ROOT`, or use `make`'s `-C` option (`make -C $SAGE_ROOT ...`). Alternatively, do

```sh
$ export NUM_THREADS=4   # once per session, or in your ~/.bashrc

$ make -e ptest          # from SAGE_ROOT; '-e' tells 'make' to take NUM_THREADS
                         # from your environment, i.e. override the default setting(s)
```

Also, the `make` method doesn't include testing the examples as `sage -testall` (in theory) does, but *fortunately<sup>TM</sup>* that isn't implemented at all yet. (`SAGE_ROOT/examples/test_all`, which is also called when you run `sage -testall`, just issues a warning and exits.) :)

> Let me know, and I'll propose it on a ticket if it is not currently possible.  Thanks.  -Rob

Feel free to open a ticket for that, suggesting some suitable option to add. (`-p <NUM>`, `--threads=<NUM>`, or `-j<NUM>` like `make` takes? Note that `make -j4 ptest` wouldn't work as one perhaps would expect.)

Or we could simply implement `sage -tp <NUM> --all`, `sage -ptestall <NUM>`, `sage -tp-all <NUM>` or whatever. Separating the option to specify the number of threads (and the "all" option) is IMHO a better choice.

We're going to merge the scripts for sequential and parallel testing anyway.
