The GAP change is implemented fine, so positive review. 

However, the syntax of the HTML in GAP's documentation is incorrect. I just looked in index.htm and this immediately struck me:

```
<OL>
  <LI><A HREF="tut/chapters.htm">Tutorial</A>
  <LI><A HREF="ref/chapters.htm">Reference Manual</A>
  <LI><A HREF="prg/chapters.htm">Programming Tutorial</A>
  <LI><A HREF="ext/chapters.htm">Programming Reference Manual</A>
  <LI><A HREF="new/chapters.htm">New Features for Developers</A>
</OL>
```

There should be a `</LI>` on the end of list items, so the first would be:

```
  <LI><A HREF="tut/chapters.htm">Tutorial</A></LI>
```

but all 5 are missing, but that's obviously an upstream problem, so I have cc'ed the two people listed as the upstream contacts for GAP

This is actually **correct** HTML, the `</LI>` end tags are optional.  So it's not a bug, even if the developers acknowledge it.

I'm not sure what the following is supposed to do (or mean):

```sh
    # Build and install docs if requested
    if [ "x$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = xyes ] ; then
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Error building gap docs."
            exit 1
        fi
        mkdir -p $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/gap
        cp -r src/doc/htm $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/gap/html
    fi
```
Either there's a command missing to **build** the documentation, or we don't have to build it, in which case testing `$?` there is useless, since previous errors are catched above that block.  (On the other hand, whether the creation of the directory and the copy command succeeded isn't checked at all, so maybe the `if`-block was supposed to be *below* the `cp`.)

I've currently changed this to

```sh
    # Build and install docs if requested:
    if [[ "$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes ]]; then
        # ?????
        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
            echo "Error building GAP docs."
            exit 1
        fi
        mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOCAL"/share/doc/gap &&
        cp -r src/doc/htm "$SAGE_LOCAL"/share/doc/gap/html
        if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
            echo >&2 "Error copying GAP's HTML documentation."
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
```

Btw., the description in `SPKG.txt` (still) says the docs (as well as tests, which seem to be there again, too) have been removed from the spkg.  The `src/doc/` directory in contrast contains (subdirectories with) lots of LaTeX, HTML and probably other files.




I'm currently working on a GAP 4.4.12.p7 spkg for #7041, so perhaps leave comments (also) there.

We've talked a lot about a different way to go about building and installing the spkg docs (see #11197, for example) by having a separate spkg-install-docs script, sort of like how we have a separate spkg-check script.  

I agree that the current test of $? doesn't make much sense; something is clearly missing.

Just wanted to cc me on that ticket, then realizing that I've already commented on it... m)

(To my excuse, this was 7 month ago.)

Well, currently the (apparently pre-built) HTML docs to get installed are there; I'm just not sure whether these are from upstream, or some Sage developer prepared them.  I'll just add a note on that to `SPKG.txt`; I think we can then remove the other files (LaTeX sources etc.) from the spkg, at least for the moment.

Actually, I like that!
