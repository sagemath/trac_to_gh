Polyhedra (objects of class Polyhedron) cannot be dumped or saved:

```
sage: polytopes.dodecahedron(QQ).dumps()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/terhorst/<ipython console> in <module>()

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/sage_object.so in sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject.dumps (sage/structure/sage_object.c:2108)()

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
```

As a workaround, I pickle a hash of the rays, vertices, and lines defining the polyhedron.

1. I think `__setstate__` would look better without checks for `exclude_keys` which is unnecessary.
   1. Equality/"non-equality" tests seem to be not the most efficient ones, although for generic polyhedra it is not obvious what one should do instead.
   2. Chosen definition of `==`, i.e. equality as sets of points, fits nicely together with other containment checks, but is inconsistent with the current situation for cones and fans. This bugs me a little bit, but not too much and I still prefer cones to take into account the ray order.

Anyway, all this is more like just thinking aloud, I am satisfied with the patch as is and switching it to positive review! (But feel free to address the first issue if you want ;-))
