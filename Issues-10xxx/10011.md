```sh
user@host$ ./sage -upgrade | tee upgrade.log
```
appears to hang (without giving **any** output).

This is because `sage-update` prompts the user for confirmation, but doesn't flush the output.

The attached patch to `sage-update` (a Python script called by `sage-upgrade`) adds flushing various output and also contains some clean-up and corrections (to comments, docstrings, and the messages printed).

Very true.

The patch looks fine and fixes the problem mentioned in the ticket.  I can't really be sure that it doesn't break anything, but positive_review anyway.
