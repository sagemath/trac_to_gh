FWIW, I've found when building on Solaris with a special library for memory allocation, which allows leaks to be detected, before I got to the 

```
sage: 
```

there was already memory leaked. I think it was only 14 bytes, but once I did a few calculations, more showed up. I think there are quite a few in Sage. Of course, some are more serious than others, but whatever the amount of memory leaked, it shows there's a coding error.

As I mentioned on the thread, I tracked this down to a call from the coercion system to create an element of the parent.  The coercion system did this when it was trying to figure out the action of the number on the vector:

The problem seems to stem from the lines

```
     cdef Element x = X.an_element()
     cdef Element y = Y.an_element()
```

inside of the `detect_element_action` function in `coerce_actions.pyx`.  Notice:

So `w` is a 10000 long vector over "ambient_pid_with_category". I'd call this alone a bug, for this is horribly inefficient.
Coercion for module operation could be much better...

My guess is that "an_element()" gets memoised, and retained instead of being destroyed at each for-loop. Indeed:

```
sage: for i in [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]:
....:     
....:     A=(1/2)*vector([x/2 for x in range(i*1000)])
....:     get_memory_usage()
....:     
261.58984375
513.59765625
1073.109375
2057.37890625
2057.37890625
2057.37890625
2057.37890625
2057.62890625
sage: for i in [1,3,5,1,3,5]:
    A=(1/2)*vector([x/2 for x in range(i*1000)])
    get_memory_usage()
....:     
2057.62890625
2057.62890625
3614.55078125
3614.55078125
3614.80078125
3615.05078125
```
So we get these huge vectors clogging up the memory, in hope that someone might want to compute in the free modules (over ambient_pid_with_category) of these dimensions  again...

Should one just turn the memoisation for modules off completely?
This would not cure the coercion inefficiency completely, but at least would prevent this leak...

At least with #14711, the parent and its cached elements appear to be correctly destroyed after each loop turn. However, calling `an_element()` triggers the computation of a basis, and the whole basis is cached!
