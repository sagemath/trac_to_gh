At [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/9e729cb5d909bd53), Thomas pointed to a bug that boils down as follows:

```
sage: F.<x> = GF(4)
sage: P.<y> = F[]
sage: p = P.random_element(5,5)
sage: SR(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 1 positional argument (0 given)
```

Reading the `_symbolic_` method, one is pointed to the subs method, which is

```
    def subs(self, *x, **kwds):
        if len(x) == 1 and isinstance(x[0], dict):
            g = self.parent().gen()
            if x[0].has_key(g):
                return self(x[0][g])
            elif len(x[0]) > 0:
                raise TypeError, "keys do not match self's parent"
            return self
        return self.__call__(*x, **kwds)
```
and there is the error again:

```
sage: p(y=y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 1 positional argument (0 given)
```

Indeed, the call method of p is

```
    def __call__(self, a):
        cdef ntl_ZZ_pE _a
        cdef ZZ_pE_c c_b

        K = self._parent.base_ring()

        try:
            if a.parent() is not K:
                a = K.coerce(a)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError, NotImplementedError):
            return Polynomial.__call__(self, a)

        _a = self._parent._modulus.ZZ_pE(list(a.polynomial()))
        ZZ_pEX_eval(c_b, self.x, _a.x)

        R = K.polynomial_ring()
        return K(str(R(ZZ_pE_c_to_list(c_b))))
```

So, my patch will change the call method so that the arguments can either a single positional argument or one named argument (using the variable name).

There's one typo:

```
raise TypeError, "%s__call__() accepts no named argument except 'x'"%(type(self),self.variable_name())
```
needs to have a second formatting character.

Other than that, looks good.

Hi,

Thanks for finding it!

Actually there was another bug in it: When no positional argument together with a named argument different from the variable name was provided, then the "wrong" error was raised.

This is fixed in the updated patch, and I also added tests that demonstrate both errors:

```
            sage: p(2)
            x + 1
            sage: p(y=2)
            x + 1
            sage: p(3,y=2)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex.Polynomial_ZZ_pEX'>__call__() takes exactly 1 argument
            sage: p(x=2)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex.Polynomial_ZZ_pEX'>__call__() accepts no named argument except 'y'
```

Looks fine to me.  Once the doctests finish, it has a positive review from me.

I'm going to be traveling and not checking in on this for a while; if someone else wants to finalize it once the doctests pass, go for it.
