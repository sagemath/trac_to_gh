I don't immediately agree. I think that would muddle up the instructions on reviewing too much; we already have two descriptions which are referred to as more or less mandatory reading (the one in the Walkthrough and the one in the Trac manual). I remember how much work it felt like, having to read many pages of guide before being able to review a single patch. Having a third covering almost the same is way too much. That's why I added William's blog as a link, which gives it an air of "this is how someone else does it as well, which you might read now or once you've tried reviewing a few times.".

I think William's blog entry contained three important additions to what is already in the documentation:
- A better explanation of "why should you review"
- A (brief) guide on how William does it, what he considers important and so on, giving a second aspect of Sage and reviewing.
- Ideas on how to automate and improve the process for reviewing many tickets.

So I think the best alternative to linking to the blog entry is to clean up the guide to have one - more comprehensive - description of the reviewing process, compiled from the three we have now. This should contain all the goodies of all three, eatly written into one and structured into how to do it the first time, and how to later streamline the process when reviewing many patches. This would probably require a major restructuring of at least the Walkthrough and the Trac Manual, though.

I agree with your point about putting William's materials into the Developer's Guide; this should be a separate ticket. However, I disagree with your argument that there are currently two separate guidelines in the Developer's Guide for reviewing patches. At best, the materials in the walk-through can only serve as an entry point into other parts of the Developer's Guide where more detailed information is available.

I hope my reviewer patch (see [attachment:trac-10201_reviewer.patch]) has clarified that the section "Reviewing patches" in the Developer's Guide is where anyone should consult for detailed information on the review process.

Your patch seems very sensible to me. It is hard to judge exactly how someone reading this for the first time -- with all the awesomeness of Sage and the development process looming above him -- will read this, but with the explicit wording of "detailed information", it seems ok.

I can see your point regarding the walk-through, and with fresh eyes, I think actually the Developer's Guide is well structured on this point as it is. An elegant merger of the current Reviewing Patches and William's blog is the way to go in the long run then.
 
Should this patch just get the green light then? And then at some later point, a Trac will be opened on merging William's blog entry directly and removing the link added by this trac.
