I think that for all symbolic expression `s` should hold

```
sage: s == s.operator()(*s.operands())
```

That currently does not work, for two reasons.

1. There may be no operator at all:

```
sage: print x.operator()
None
sage: x.operands()
[]
```
I believe there should instead be an identity operator.

2. The list of operands may be longer than what the operator accepts:

```
sage: s = 0.001*x^2+0.01*x+0.1*sin(1.01*x)+1
sage: s.operands()
[0.00100000000000000*x^2, 0.0100000000000000*x,
0.100000000000000*sin(1.01000000000000*x), 1]
sage: s.operator()(*s.operands())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note to self: after this is fixed (or at least just the arithmetic operators), `simplify_hypergeometric` should be added to `simplify_full`. Now it cannot be added because it will sometimes raise errors due to this bug.

Burcin, is there a problem with setting the sum operator to `Expression.add`, for example? I don't understand why we have to define new functions representing the arithmetic operators.

This will not work with some symbolic functions because they may have been called with the `hold=True` keyword, and calling them again doesn't know about it. See also #17849. The solution of that ticket in line with this one would be to make keywords into operands (strings?, a dedicated class `OperatorKeyword`?).

Another possible solution would be to abandon the `hold` keyword and introduce a `hold` context, see #10035.
