Hi,

I added a relatively fast check at the very begining of the `__init__` method that verifies that the argument is a type or not (using the function `PyType_Check` from the C-API. It is the cause of many errors (see the log of the patchbot) and I do not know whether it is a good thing to check...

See the following [sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8f28e2637e92e1c1).

No. By the way I do not understand why `Posets`  and `Sequences` are categories and not `Parent`...

Now, why is there both `Parent` and `Sets`? The latter is an abstract class, while the former is a concrete implementation (and currently the only concrete base implementation; but we could imagine having others). Of course, a lot of the current features of `Parent` really should be moved up in `Sets` or in other categories. Some just need to be taken care of (handling some backward compatibility issues). Some are more intrinsically difficult\nbecause of the lack of multiple inheritance in Cython; that's analog to the `Ring` versus `Rings`\nsituation.",

The category corresponding to `Parent` is `Sets`. Now, why is there both `Parent` and `Sets`? The latter is an abstract class, while the former is a concrete implementation (and currently the only concrete base implementation; but we could imagine having others). Of course, a lot of the current features of `Parent` really should be moved up in `Sets` or in other categories. Some just need to be taken care of (handling some backward compatibility issues). Some are more intrinsically difficult
because of the lack of multiple inheritance in Cython; that's analog to the `Ring` versus `Rings`
situation.

Thanks Nicolas. But I do not understand why it is an answer to my question: "why Posets and Sequences are categories and not Parent?" As far as I understand, to declare something to have a category it needs to inherit from Parent (via `Parent.__init__(category=XYZ)`). So I do not see how to avoid `Parent`  by "having others".
The issue of `Ring` versus `Rings` has nothing to do with my question, or I missed something.

I am fine with the first one. But the result of `.parent()` should be a parent isn't it? Why not

```
def parent(self):
    return Set_PythonType(type(self))
```

On the other hand, the `MaximaWrapper` does not inherit from `Element` which is perfectly fine. I am worried that we need this method. The bug for me is the following behavior

```
sage: parent(sin(1).maxima_methods())
parent(sin(1))
```
which should just behave like

```
sage: parent(int(1))
<type 'int'>
```
(which is also strange but perfectly fine if uniform).

The reason is that there is a too permissive `__getattr__` in `MaximaWrapper` which never raises `AttributeError`. I would really prefer that:
- either we move your solution at the level of `SageObject`
- or we hack `__getattr__` of `MaximaWrapper`

Hmm I am not sure I understand your question then. Can you rephrase it?

Just a quick note for now: to have a category, you need to be a CategoryObject (surprise surprise ...).
