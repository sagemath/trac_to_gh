log in to a machine that has Sage, copy patch location, hg qimport, hg qapply, [comment:3 hg qrefresh -e], remove "[mq]: " from the commit message, hg export, copy patch to office pc, log in to trac, upload patch, tick needs_review, click Submit

All that to remove four characters from a commit message.

Why couldn't I just edit the patch to remove those 4 characters? Would it have screwed up some kind of checksum?
