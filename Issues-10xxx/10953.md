The following statement yields an error:

 sage: Graph().is_regular()

A quick fix to this is to test if the size of the graph is zero, in which case we return true. I assume the empty graph is k-regular for any k. If this is not the case for sage, another (better) error should be thrown.

You should include the ticket number in the doctest.

I would test self.order() rather than len(self) to save the reader from having to go look up what `__len__` does, but that's just personal taste.

Almost! Would you mind moving the comment to its own line? There's nothing wrong with it at the moment, but in-line comments like that are given special treatment (e.g. #long, #optional, #todo...) so I think they should be avoided to prevent unexpected interactions.

Also: I find regularity defined "for all vertices..." so it is vacuously true that the empty graph is k-regular for any k.

I'm running a full ptestlong with the patch, and don't expect any problems.
