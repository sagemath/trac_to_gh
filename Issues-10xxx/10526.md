Attachment: **[10526_reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10526/10526_reviewer.patch.gz)**

The following is a cleaner solution, in my opinion:

```
             if hgridlines=="minor":
                hgridstyle['which']="both"
             if vgridlines=="minor":
                vgridstyle['which']="both
```
