This is a bit tricky since we need sphinx and other things installed before we can build the docs, but sphinx and the other things depend on python.  To resolve this circular dependency, we try to import sphinx.  If we can't import sphinx, then we exit without error with a message that you should install sphinx and related tools first and then try building the docs again.  This means that in order to use the environment variable, you have to install the python spkg twice, since we don't have an option to just build docs without building python.

See comments on #10828

I wonder if it might be sensible to create a new package called - python-documentation-1.0.spkg in order to resolve this circular dependency problem.

That new python-documentation-1.0.spkg gets built after both python and sphinx are built. This package then copies the contents of the python package from the python.spkg, extracts it, then builds only the documentation - not all of Python if at all possible. 

Otherwise, the build will fail for sure for everyone, which is off-putting to newcomers, even if old hands know how to get around the problem. The ability to type 'make' then go away and leave it will be lost if the build fails on this each time.

I see your note that's its impossible to build just the docs for Python. 

Another option, which would be quicker is to 
* If  `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`, build and install Python, but tar up the build and stick that in a temporary directory somewhere. 
* After sphinx and whatever else are built, extract that tar file, and just build the documentation. 

Somehow I think we should automate this, so Python's documentation gets built without manual intervention. It can't be rocket science to do this. If the worst comes to the worst, just build Python twice if `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`

Yes, I suppose worst-case is just adding a python-docs target to the deps file that builds python again after sphinx is installed.

That's quite easy to do.

Ideally though we don't want the user to have to mess with that environment variable. I think this can be automated. 

As long as there's not an issue with hard-coded paths (which may make the documentation useless if Sage is moved), then I think a temporary tar file is the best solution, as it will save a lot of time. Python is a big package to build twice if it is unnecessary. 

This needs a bit of thought, and its late here, so I'm going to bed.

Yep.  I'm thinking that the python-docs target will 

   * Check to see if SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes, and if so:
   * set the SAGE_SPKG_PYTHON_BUILD=no variable and then reinstall the python spkg (which will then just build the docs, but not python).

The user won't ever have to deal with that environment variable---it's all behind the scenes.
