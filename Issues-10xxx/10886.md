Hi, Robert!

I just took a look at your patch. Two remarks and a question:

1. The function `number_of_sets` you added is only defined for the `DisjointSet_of_integers` class. You should add it as well to the `DisjointSet_of_hashables`.

2. While you're at it, I suggest the name `number_of_subsets` instead of `number_of_sets`, since we talk about partitioning a set into disjoint subsets. It follows the terminology used in the first line of Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure).

It says that it is supposed to contain functions common to all disjoint set data structures, but it only contains two basic functions. Shouln't functions such as `cardinality`, `number_of_sets`, etc. be there too?

I feel I would code that differently today... but let's try to remember why I did it that way. The actual classes hierarchy is:

```
cdef class DisjointSet_class(SageObject):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(DisjointSet_class):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashables(DisjointSet_class):
```

Right now, the important attributes are not in `DisjointSet_class` but in the two others. Moreover, the attributes are not the same, so that almost no method are coded the same way as you noticed.

I remember I hesitated to take the following hierarchy instead (in this situation, an instance of `DisjointSet_of_hashables` would not contain an attribute `DisjointSet_of_integers` as it is the case now) :

```
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(SageObject):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashables(DisjointSet_of_integers):
```

But, then almost every methods of `DisjointSet_of_integers` was overwritten by `DisjointSet_of_hashables`. And since `DisjointSet_of_hashables` is not a `DisjointSet_of_integers`, I was feeling it was not a good hierarchy to choose. Maybe I did a mistake? Indeed, in this situation, the method `number_of_sets` would be coded at only one place.

What do you think?

Sébastien,

Can you take a look at the patch and give your opinion? I've made a few minor changes to the way the classes point at the underlying orbit partitions, which makes it easier for them to share functionality which doesn't depend on how the elements are labeled. I think this is the best "middle path" approach.

I completely agree with the patch. That's a "middle path" I haven't thought about. Adding this `_nodes` attribute to the class `DisjointSet_of_hashables` makes it behave like its twin which allow `cardinality` and `number_of_subsets` methods to jump to the parent. Thanks for the improvement.

To me it's a positive review (all tests passed, doc is fine).

Just some questions before I set this ticket to positive review.

Are `cardinality` and `number_of_subsets` the only functions that should jump to the parent class?

Correct me if I'm wrong: the reason why the methods `find`, `union`, `root_to_elements_dict`, `to_digraph`, etc. is that they are specific to each data structure. In principle, they all should be in the parent class, but be declared as "abstract", but this is not in the Python philosophy.

Does my understanding seems correct?

Alex

Alex,

I think that's all right. In principle, one could set dummy "translation" functions for the d.j.of integers class which simply act as the identity to make the code more uniform, but I don't think this is a good idea.

Cheers,

Robert

Alright!

Same as Sébastien, I tested it on sage-4.6.2, looked at the documentation and everything is fine. Positive review.
