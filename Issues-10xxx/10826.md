I use sage-feature as a placeholder for tickets with positive review which can't or won't be merged.  This ticket depends on #10792 which does not have positive review, so it can't be merged yet.  Sorry, I should have mentioned this.

If one click' on sage-feature, one gets *This is the "big feature" milestone. Tickets assigned here should have somebody responsible for the issue. Once a feature is ready to go in please retag the ticket to the next appropriate milestone and attach a patch/bundle/link to an spkg.*

The above description of "sage-feature" does not match the situation on here. Perhaps a new milestone should be created, specifically to address the case of tickets with positive review, but depending on other tickets.

Hrm. There is a problem with numpy when SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS is set.
Here's the relevant part of the log:

```
    make[2]: Entering directory `/home/drake/s/sage-4.7.alpha4/spkg/build/numpy-1.5.1.p0/src/doc'
    mkdir -p build
    touch build/generate-stamp
    mkdir -p build/html build/doctrees
    LANG=C sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html 
    /bin/sh: sphinx-build: not found
    make[2]: *** [html] Error 127
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/drake/s/sage-4.7.alpha4/spkg/build/numpy-1.5.1.p0/src/doc'
    Error building numpy docs.
```

This is a fresh build from source. It looks like we need to alter the
build dependencies to get Sphinx built early. Or perhaps the spkg
installation script could check to see if the INSTALL_DOCS variable is
set, and if so, check that Sphinx is built? 

The tricky thing here seems to be that the build deps are different if 
SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS is set.

I installed the Sphinx spkg and restarted the build, but now I get:

```
    make[2]: Entering directory `/home/drake/s/sage-4.7.alpha4/spkg/build/numpy-1.5.1.p0/src/doc'
    mkdir -p build
    touch build/generate-stamp
    mkdir -p build/html build/doctrees
    LANG=C sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/drake/s/sage-4.7.alpha4/local/bin/sphinx-build", line 6, in <module>
        import sage.all
    ImportError: No module named sage.all
    make[2]: *** [html] Error 1
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/drake/s/sage-4.7.alpha4/spkg/build/numpy-1.5.1.p0/src/doc'
    Error building numpy docs.
```
 
Yikes. Do we need the Sage library before we can build any Sphinx
documents? Do we need to build documents *after* the usual build process
is done?
