In the last month four people reported getting "RuntimeError: Unable to create L-series, due to precision or other limits in PARI." when trying to input their own interesting L-series to the Dokchitser wrapper in Sage.   The problem is in lfunctions/dokchitser.py; it's just a dumb little mistake.  The attached patch fixes it.  For review this will also need some doctests (the bug is here since the functionality was never tested!).
