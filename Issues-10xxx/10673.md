This is a meta ticket giving a road map for the cleanup of `CombinatorialFreeModule`

- Provide an implementation of `ModulesWithBasis` using a `FreeModule_sparse` internally with a ranker (as was done in MuPAD)

- #10671: Extend `FreeModule(K, n, sparse=True)` to accept `n=infinity`

- Rename `CombinatorialFreeModule` to something more appropriate in `sage.modules`, and leave a temporary alias with deprecation warning for backward compatibility

- #30194: Make `FreeModule(base_ring, enumerated set)` call `CombinatorialFreeModule`

- #10672: Put `FreeModule` in the category `ModulesWithBasis()`
- #10007: Enable deriving subclasses from `FreeModule` and `FreeModuleElement`
- #8933: Add submodule and quotient in `ModulesWithBasis` (we currently have submodules)

- #9370: customize printing of elements in `CombinatorialFreeModules`

- #18066: Move methods from `CombinatorialFreeModule` to `ModulesWithBasis`.

- #19346: Separate ABC of `CombinatorialFreeModule` from `ModulesWithBasis`.
