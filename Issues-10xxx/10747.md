The expression

```
h(6)=8
```
currently defines a symbolic function ``h`` with constant value 8. This makes no sense, but begginers make this mistake, for example if h is an array and they use () instead of []. It doesn't hurt to throw an error at all expressions

```
h(something) = ...
```
whenever something is not a symbolic variable.

Fixed in which version?

On 4.6.1, `h(6)=8` still goes through without an error message and I get

sage: h
_sage_const_6 |--> 8

IPython complains on the command line though.

It seems the real problem is in the preparser. Normally, when `f(1)=2` is preparsed on the command line, it becomes `f(Integer(1))=Integer(2)`. This is not valid python so we get an error anyway. In the notebook, the constants are extracted and assigned to variables named `_sage_const_*`. Then the `preparse_calculus()` function receives `f(_sage_const_2)=sage_const_3` as input, which is a valid construction.

[attachment:trac_10747-preparse_calculus.2.patch] changes `preparse_calculus()` to raise an error if the argument name starts with `sage.misc.preparser.numeric_literal_prefix`.

[attachment:trac_10747-preparser-docstrings-symbolic-vars.patch] adds doctest for the errors on the command line and the notebook.

It would be better if someone more familiar with the preparser reviewed my patch.

Thanks for this - nice catch.  I had to zoom through a lot of code, but this does seem to be the most efficient way to do this.  

I wonder about the error message.  In theory, one could mess with this by putting `_sage_const_` at the beginning of some legitimate variable...

Here are other fun things that already existed.

```

sage:  f (x ,y,  z ,w ) = 5=3
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
SyntaxError: keyword can't be an expression (<ipython console>, line 1)

sage: f(print)=5
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
     __tmp__=var("print"); f = symbolic_expression(Integer(5)).function(print)
                                                                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

There are lots of ways to mess with the `preparse_calculus` regular expression to get things that will give fairly mystifying error messages.  

Anyway, this all looks good, but I am prevented from testing it by my computer having had its OS reinstalled, and somehow now gcc is missing.  I still have Xcode, but not gcc.

And great work on starting your contributions, Zaf!

A thought; it might be worth documenting (if it isn't already, I didn't check) that

```
sage: f(1) = x
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call (<ipython console>, line 1)

sage: preparse("f(1)=x")
'f(Integer(1))=x'
```
I like the `\(([^()]+)\)` check for this.
