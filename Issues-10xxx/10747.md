The expression

```
h(6)=8
```
currently defines a symbolic function ``h`` with constant value 8. This makes no sense, but begginers make this mistake, for example if h is an array and they use () instead of []. It doesn't hurt to throw an error at all expressions

```
h(something) = ...
```
whenever something is not a symbolic variable.

Fixed in which version?

On 4.6.1, `h(6)=8` still goes through without an error message and I get

sage: h
_sage_const_6 |--> 8

IPython complains on the command line though.

You're right. I noticed the bug on the notebook. Then some days later, I updated, and got the right error message on the console. It didn't occur to me that the behaviour could be different.

It seems the real problem is in the preparser. Normally, when `f(1)=2` is preparsed on the command line, it becomes `f(Integer(1))=Integer(2)`. This is not valid python so we get an error anyway. In the notebook, the constants are extracted and assigned to variables named `_sage_const_*`. Then the `preparse_calculus()` function receives `f(_sage_const_2)=sage_const_3` as input, which is a valid construction.

[attachment:trac_10747-preparse_calculus.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10747/trac_10747-preparse_calculus.2.patch) changes `preparse_calculus()` to raise an error if the argument name starts with `sage.misc.preparser.numeric_literal_prefix`.

[attachment:trac_10747-preparser-docstrings-symbolic-vars.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10747/trac_10747-preparser-docstrings-symbolic-vars.patch) adds doctest for the errors on the command line and the notebook.

It would be better if someone more familiar with the preparser reviewed my patch.

Thanks for this - nice catch.  I had to zoom through a lot of code, but this does seem to be the most efficient way to do this.  

I wonder about the error message.  In theory, one could mess with this by putting `_sage_const_` at the beginning of some legitimate variable...

Here are other fun things that already existed.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

There are lots of ways to mess with the `preparse_calculus` regular expression to get things that will give fairly mystifying error messages.  

Anyway, this all looks good, but I am prevented from testing it by my computer having had its OS reinstalled, and somehow now gcc is missing.  I still have Xcode, but not gcc.

And great work on starting your contributions, Zaf!

A thought; it might be worth documenting (if it isn't already, I didn't check) that

```
sage: f(1) = x
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 1
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call (<ipython console>, line 1)

sage: preparse("f(1)=x")
'f(Integer(1))=x'
```
I like the `\(([^()]+)\)` check for this.
