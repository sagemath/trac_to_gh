Put FreeModule in the category ModulesWithBasis(), and implement all the related methods. This should make FreeModule and CombinatorialFreeModule compatible and consistent.

There might be some compatibility issues to handle.

I put `VectorSpaces` in the category `ModulesWithBasis` because `FreeModules` is already an alias for `ModulesWithBasis`. There doesn't seem to be any compatibility issues that I noticed.

Thanks for working on this! A big part of the ticket is in "and implement all the related methods". The point is to have all the zillion little utilities of ModulesWithBasis (term, monomial, sum_of_terms, leading_term, __iter__, ...) also work for plain FreeModules.

My guess is that the main incompatibility that needs to be discussed is about __iter__. Indeed, as far as I remember:

```
      for x in v:
          ...
```
iterates over pairs for "Combinatorial" free modules(like a iteritems of dictionaries), whereas it iterates over coefficients for plain free modules. So we have to decide on which interface we want and how to handle backward compatibility.

Cheers


Granted: ModulesWithBasis should have appropriate abstract methods and tests so that, if an implementation does not provide the required methods, the testsuite barks.

There is still a minor issue with `__iter__`, however we can avoid those in code by using `monomial_coefficients()` which give the consistent behavior. I also think we can leave the issues raised in #18310 to be handled there and once `submodule` supports coordinate rings...
