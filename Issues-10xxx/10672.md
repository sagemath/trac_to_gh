Put FreeModule in the category ModulesWithBasis(), and implement all the related methods. This should make FreeModule and CombinatorialFreeModule compatible and consistent.

There might be some compatibility issues to handle.

Depends on #18066

Thanks for working on this! A big part of the ticket is in "and implement all the related methods". The point is to have all the zillion little utilities of ModulesWithBasis (term, monomial, sum_of_terms, leading_term, `__iter__`, ...) also work for plain FreeModules.

My guess is that the main incompatibility that needs to be discussed is about __iter__. Indeed, as far as I remember:

```
      for x in v:
          ...
```
iterates over pairs for "Combinatorial" free modules(like a iteritems of dictionaries), whereas it iterates over coefficients for plain free modules. So we have to decide on which interface we want and how to handle backward compatibility.

Cheers


Granted: ModulesWithBasis should have appropriate abstract methods and tests so that, if an implementation does not provide the required methods, the testsuite barks.

LGTM (it is really just the last commit; everything else is from #18066).

The heisenberg.py part of #16820 relies on this patch, so that'll serve as a doctest.
