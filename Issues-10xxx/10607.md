It also looks like the most recent version is 2.3.64; is it worth upgrading?

Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
Making script relocatable
Finished installing phc-2.3.65.spkg
```
In either case, I would print a blank line before the warning message, to highlight it, and maybe use "ERROR: This package ...".  I think using `sys.exit(1)` is better than `sys.exit(0)`, since it didn't really successfully install phc.

Do you know of anyone with access to Mac OS X 10.4 (ppc and intel) and 10.5 (intel) machines, to test there?
