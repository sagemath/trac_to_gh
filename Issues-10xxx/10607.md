It also looks like the most recent version is 2.3.64; is it worth upgrading?

In either case, I would print a blank line before the warning message, to highlight it, and maybe use "ERROR: This package ...".  I think using `sys.exit(1)` is better than `sys.exit(0)`, since it didn't really successfully install phc.
