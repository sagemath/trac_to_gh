Looks like the output of phcpack might have changed, which breaks the parsing.  So the interface needs to be tweaked.

This seems to work on OS X 10.6, but I don't have access to OS X 10.5 to test it there.  I'm going to try it on on `OpenSolaris` (x86), but my guess is it won't work.  This is not a blocker for an optional spkg, but that is one of our supported platforms.

It also looks like the most recent version is 2.3.64; is it worth upgrading?

You could add `import sys` at the beginning and then put `sys.exit(1)` after the message.  This will cause an error, and I'm not sure whether you want that or not -- it will say

In either case, I would print a blank line before the warning message, to highlight it, and maybe use "ERROR: This package ...".  I think using `sys.exit(1)` is better than `sys.exit(0)`, since it didn't really successfully install phc.
