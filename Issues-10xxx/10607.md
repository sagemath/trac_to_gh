It also looks like the most recent version is 2.3.64; is it worth upgrading?

Oops, I made a mistake in my suggestion.  After the print statement ("This package does not work..."), the program needs to exit.  You could add `import sys` at the beginning and then put `sys.exit(1)` after the message.  This will cause an error, and I'm not sure whether you want that or not -- it will say

```

```
You could use `sys.exit(0)` instead, in which case it would say

In either case, I would print a blank line before the warning message, to highlight it, and maybe use "ERROR: This package ...".  I think using `sys.exit(1)` is better than `sys.exit(0)`, since it didn't really successfully install phc.

Do you know of anyone with access to Mac OS X 10.4 (ppc and intel) and 10.5 (intel) machines, to test there?
