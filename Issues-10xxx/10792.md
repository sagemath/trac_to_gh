CCing Ethan, since he was the original author on the riemann.pyx file.

Ethan: I've been looking at the code that seems to cause two problems.  First is a ComplexWarnings that now appears in numpy 1.5.1, which I believe comes from a temporary array that was assumed to be real, but maybe should be complex.  I've rewritten the affected lines to not use a temporary array.

The other problem seems like it is a problem even before the upgrade---I keep getting `Warning: invalid value encountered in divide`, and the error happens in these lines in the `_generate_theta_array` function in calculus/riemann.pyx:

```
        K = np.array(
            [-TWOPI / N * sadp * sadp[t] * 1 / (TWOPI * I) *
              ((dp / adp) / (cp - cp[t]) -
               ((dp[t] / adp[t]) / (cp - cp[t])).conjugate())
              for t in np.arange(NB)], dtype=np.complex128)
```

I noticed several things that could be pulled out of the inner loop, and so rewrote this line in the attached patch (which I'll update shortly).  However, I don't know this code or the algorithms very well---can you look at the patch?

It appears that the warnings happen when there is a division by zero, as in this test case:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: a=np.array([1,2],dtype=np.complex128)
sage: b=np.array([0,1],dtype=np.complex128)
sage: a/b
Warning: invalid value encountered in divide
array([ nan nanj,   2. +0.j])
sage: a[0]/b[0]
(nan+nan*j)
```

So should we turn off the error checking for this error when doing this operation since at least one entry in cp-cp[t] will be zero?  Or should we check for this entry and not calculate it?

	sage -t -long "trees/sage-4.6.1/devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx"
Total time for all tests: 105.1 seconds

```

It looks like the errors are all slight numerical errors.  Can someone confirm that?

You can go through the following steps:

1) drop the numpy spkg in the spkg/standard folder

2) sage -f numpy-1.5.1

3) apply the patches (from here and #10821 ) the easiest way is to follow the procedure from the developer's manual [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch)

4) sage -b

5) test

It does not demonstrate that the result on these machines is approximately correct - the code could be incorrect and be giving results 1000 times what they should be. \n\nI'd feel a lot happier if the doctest used an example where the result is known, and cited a reference to the result. \n\nConsider for example the approach I took to testing some finite difference software I wrote for computing the impedance of electrical transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. \n\nhttp://atlc.sourceforge.net/\n\nAlthough there are a few **examples** demonstrating the answer from strange cross sections, where I have no chance of computing the result analytically\n\nhttp://atlc.sourceforge.net/examples.html\n\nfor the purposes of *testing* \n\nhttp://atlc.sourceforge.net/accuracy.html\n\nthe tests were based on cases where analytical results were known. The results were checked on a variety of CPUs (AMD, Cray, Intel Itanium, Intel x86, PA-RISC, PPC, Sun SPARC etc) on a variety of operating systems (AIX, Irix, HP-UX, OS X, Solaris, tru64, Unicos, Unixware, plus various Linux distributions)\n\n> > Also, if the algorithm, or its implementation in Sage is has poor numerical stability, this should be documented.\n\n> \n> As far as I've seen, it's not unstable in the sense of dramatically losing accuracy, but the many numerical calculations are sensitive to slight differences in machine-level implementation.

So essentially the "test" in its current form just demonstrates that the result on different machines is approximately the same. It does not demonstrate that the result on these machines is approximately correct - the code could be incorrect and be giving results 1000 times what they should be. 

I'd feel a lot happier if the doctest used an example where the result is known, and cited a reference to the result. 

Consider for example the approach I took to testing some finite difference software I wrote for computing the impedance of electrical transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. 

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/

Although there are a few **examples** demonstrating the answer from strange cross sections, where I have no chance of computing the result analytically

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/examples.html

for the purposes of *testing* 

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/accuracy.html

the tests were based on cases where analytical results were known. The results were checked on a variety of CPUs (AMD, Cray, Intel Itanium, Intel x86, PA-RISC, PPC, Sun SPARC etc) on a variety of operating systems (AIX, Irix, HP-UX, OS X, Solaris, tru64, Unicos, Unixware, plus various Linux distributions)

You can increase the numerical precision of the computation by increasing N (the number of collocation points on the boundary.) I'll can create a couple of comparison tests that can be run on different machines to see if that decreases the numerical deviation.

Well as far as I know Numpy will use machine precision, whereas anything you do in Mathematica can be done to arbitrary precision. There are many things in Sage that can only be done on an FPU, so use of an arbitrary precision floating point maths is not supported. Mathematica does not suffer that limitation. 

Lets say for example a doctest of Sage's factorial function used 50! as an example, and gave the result `30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960522000000000000`.

I was reading only recently about when a new Mersenne prime was found. That was found on a x86 chip, but it was also verified by other software on an x86 chip and also by yet more software on a SPARC processor. 

It seems to me that many doctests in Sage, just show reproducibly, and don't actually test the algorithm or the implementation. This appears to be one such *test*.

Updating the work issues.  We still need
* doctest change for Jason's patch
* some type of confirmation of one or two analytic examples of this

Though in my opinion, this second one could be moved to #10821, since the problem was there before.

Also, seeing this made me look through riemann.pyx, and it turns out that file could use some general TLC. Esp. with regard to a few doc things and some fairly massive redundancy with complex plots. See #10945.

Jason's patch is correct.  Positive review on that part.

Here's another thought.

```
        self.cps = np.zeros([self.B, N], dtype=np.complex128)
        # Find the points on the boundaries and their derivatives.
        for k in xrange(self.B):
            for i in xrange(N):
                self.cps[k, i] = np.complex(fs[k](self.tk[i]))
```
So when the original code does

```
        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1])
        for k in xrange(self.B):
            temp[k, 0] = self.cps[k, 0]
```
then I would say the problem is in taking np.zeros and assigning complex numbers to that temp array, which is defined to be real a priori.  Maybe that is the change in how Numpy did things - it now complains?   

My point being that if we change 

```
-        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1])
+        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1],dtype=np.complex128)
```
and that also removes the errors, and we get the same doctest changes, then we can be sure that the problem is simply that this is a really hard numerical thing to get right, and Ethan should be commended for even getting within epsilon.

I love the plots; I tried to do this with Grapher when I taught complex analysis in some random naive ways, and it never worked very well.  This is a great addition.  \n\nSo, as far as I'm concerned, positive review once someone actually uploads a patch that corrects the doctests.

(1.1489715720875546+0.013786517516344927j)
```
There is nothing wrong with what the values are doing, though, and that's the important part.  Taking a hint from the doc:

```
sage: "error =", m.inverse_riemann_map(m.riemann_map(.49)) - .49
('error =', (-0.00032080499713899036-5.4888563828232042e-05j))
sage: "error =", m.inverse_riemann_map(m.riemann_map(.495)) - .495
('error =', (-0.0040172648041303383+0.00096565040731113271j))
sage: "error =", m.inverse_riemann_map(m.riemann_map(.499)) - .499
('error =', (-0.95337317730092064-0.0038944237237982667j))
```
And honestly, the documentation is clear that near boundaries there are problems.

It is clear to me that at least for simple examples this performs as advertised, so I don't think Ethan needs to justify the error; it's just a very unstable thing, which probably can be improved by using something more sophisticated than trapezoid or Simpson (maybe?) - but that's not this ticket.  I love the plots; I tried to do this with Grapher when I taught complex analysis in some random naive ways, and it never worked very well.  This is a great addition.  

So, as far as I'm concerned, positive review once someone actually uploads a patch that corrects the doctests.  I recommend that the analytic examples go on #10945, unless Ethan has the time to add them here.  The Numpy upgrade should go in sooner rather than later.
