on line 499 in riemann.pyx. pt1 type has never been defined so I don't know if cython automatically give it the type of the right hand side or if it defaults to something else. In which case it would have to be cast.

<a id='comment:11'></a>CCing Ethan, since he was the original author on the riemann.pyx file.

Ethan: I've been looking at the code that seems to cause two problems.  First is a ComplexWarnings that now appears in numpy 1.5.1, which I believe comes from a temporary array that was assumed to be real, but maybe should be complex.  I've rewritten the affected lines to not use a temporary array.

The other problem seems like it is a problem even before the upgrade---I keep getting `Warning: invalid value encountered in divide`, and the error happens in these lines in the `_generate_theta_array` function in calculus/riemann.pyx:

```
        K = np.array(
            [-TWOPI / N * sadp * sadp[t] * 1 / (TWOPI * I) *
              ((dp / adp) / (cp - cp[t]) -
               ((dp[t] / adp[t]) / (cp - cp[t])).conjugate())
              for t in np.arange(NB)], dtype=np.complex128)
```

I noticed several things that could be pulled out of the inner loop, and so rewrote this line in the attached patch (which I'll update shortly).  However, I don't know this code or the algorithms very well---can you look at the patch?

It appears that the warnings happen when there is a division by zero, as in this test case:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: a=np.array([1,2],dtype=np.complex128)
sage: b=np.array([0,1],dtype=np.complex128)
sage: a/b
Warning: invalid value encountered in divide
array([ nan nanj,   2. +0.j])
sage: a[0]/b[0]
(nan+nan*j)
```

So should we turn off the error checking for this error when doing this operation since at least one entry in cp-cp[t] will be zero?  Or should we check for this entry and not calculate it?

You can go through the following steps:

1) drop the numpy spkg in the spkg/standard folder

2) sage -f numpy-1.5.1

3) apply the patches (from here and #10821 ) the easiest way is to follow the procedure from the developer's manual [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch)

4) sage -b

5) test

Unfortunately to my knowledge, this is the only extant tool that performs this sort of Riemann map. I believe that there are one or two cases where the analytic map is known, so I can probably add some tests that check accuracy against that.

As far as I've seen, it's not unstable in the sense of dramatically losing accuracy, but the many numerical calculations are sensitive to slight differences in machine-level implementation. This results in slight differences in the final error. I should be able to do some error analysis and see if these deviations are within the bounds of the algorithm.

Not without complete reimplementation, and I know of no reason why their performance should be better than ours. You can increase the numerical precision of the computation by increasing N (the number of collocation points on the boundary.) I'll can create a couple of comparision tests that can be run on different machines to see if that decreases the numerical deviation.

So essentially the "test" in its current form just demonstrates that the result on different machines is approximately the same. It does not demonstrate that the result on these machines is approximately correct - the code could be incorrect and be giving results 1000 times what they should be. 

I'd feel a lot happier if the doctest used an example where the result is known, and cited a reference to the result. 

Consider for example the approach I took to testing some finite difference software I wrote for computing the impedance of electrical transmission lines of arbitrary cross section. 

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/

Although there are a few **examples** demonstrating the answer from strange cross sections, where I have no chance of computing the result analytically

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/examples.html

for the purposes of *testing* 

http://atlc.sourceforge.net/accuracy.html

the tests were based on cases where analytical results were known. The results were checked on a variety of CPUs (AMD, Cray, Intel Itanium, Intel x86, PA-RISC, PPC, Sun SPARC etc) on a variety of operating systems (AIX, Irix, HP-UX, OS X, Solaris, tru64, Unicos, Unixware, plus various Linux distributions)

Well as far as I know Numpy will use machine precision, whereas anything you do in Mathematica can be done to arbitrary precision. There are many things in Sage that can only be done on an FPU, so use of an arbitrary precision floating point maths is not supported. Mathematica does not suffer that limitation. 

Lets say for example a doctest of Sage's factorial function used 50! as an example, and gave the result `30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960522000000000000`. If every machine it was tried on, using a variety of CPUs (PPC, SPARC, Intel x86, AMD x86, Intel Itanium processors) gave the same result, it does not prove Sage is correct.

It seems to me that many doctests in Sage, just show reproducibly, and don't actually test the algorithm or the implementation. This appears to be one such *test*.

<a id='comment:27'></a>OK, I have tried a more minimal change and get basically the same result on the riemann.pyx doctest. The interpolator.pyx doctest is fine.

I will leave Ethan work his magic before commenting again.

Updating the work issues.  We still need

Though in my opinion, this second one could be moved to #10821, since the problem was there before.

Also, seeing this made me look through riemann.pyx, and it turns out that file could use some general TLC. Esp. with regard to a few doc things and some fairly massive redundancy with complex plots. See #10945.

<a id='comment:29'></a>Jason's patch is correct.  Positive review on that part.

Here's another thought.

```
        self.cps = np.zeros([self.B, N], dtype=np.complex128)
        # Find the points on the boundaries and their derivatives.
        for k in xrange(self.B):
            for i in xrange(N):
                self.cps[k, i] = np.complex(fs[k](self.tk[i]))
```
So when the original code does

```
        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1])
        for k in xrange(self.B):
            temp[k, 0] = self.cps[k, 0]
```
then I would say the problem is in taking np.zeros and assigning complex numbers to that temp array, which is defined to be real a priori.  Maybe that is the change in how Numpy did things - it now complains?   

My point being that if we change 

```
-        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1])
+        temp = np.zeros([self.B, 1],dtype=np.complex128)
```
and that also removes the errors, and we get the same doctest changes, then we can be sure that the problem is simply that this is a really hard numerical thing to get right, and Ethan should be commended for even getting within epsilon.

('error =', (-0.95337317730092064-0.0038944237237982667j))
```
And honestly, the documentation is clear that near boundaries there are problems.

It is clear to me that at least for simple examples this performs as advertised, so I don't think Ethan needs to justify the error; it's just a very unstable thing, which probably can be improved by using something more sophisticated than trapezoid or Simpson (maybe?) - but that's not this ticket.

I don't have my iMac G4 anymore. It is the property of Massey University and I had to leave it behind when I left for the university of Canterbury in December. 

On the other hand I have access to IBM power 5 hardware now (running both linux and aix - to be upgraded to power 7 this year). But I haven't managed to get sage running on that yet. The linux side is running suse-9 (SLES) and is a right old mess. I probably shouldn't bother fixing the toolchain before the new gear arrives with fresh software. On the aix side I have to sort out compilers since CC default to XLC and fortran seems to default to GNU (never mind the fact XL fortran is present as well) and it stops at prereq. On the bright side gentoo prefix is "supported" on aix - so I may get somewhere that way :)

I very much doubt you could build Sage on AIX. #9999 list at least some of the issues. 

Since I happened to create the 10,000<sup>th</sup> Sage trac ticket (#10000), I guess I should fix the fact the GSL library fails to install on AIX 5.3. I create a patch, which has been accepted upstream, but never got around to actually creating a new Sage package for GSL. Perhaps I can convince someone to review it if I do - there's an extra test in the configure script, and changes to a file with aix in the name, so is only used on AIX.
