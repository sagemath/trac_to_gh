Hi,

Looks nice.

I uploaded your patch in a git branch and added three commits above:
- the first one to remove the trailing whitespaces
- the second one to fits with Sage standard for the docs and make the code more compatible with Python 3
- the third to have a better caching

Please, tell me what you think.

Vincent

> Why the separate branches for `D` absolute/relative?

Assuming that you meant `C` rather than `D`, I've changed the code as suggested.  I don't know why this was done separately.  Perhaps the simpler approach didn't work when this ticket began four years ago.

I've made one other change which should have been made before.  It solves a problem which arose in [http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24173/homomorphisms-for-relative-number-fields/](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24173/homomorphisms-for-relative-number-fields/).
