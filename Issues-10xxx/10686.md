In characteristic p, the formula for the Hecke operator Tp is much simpler (and faster to work through) than in the general case.  It's worth having this as a special case in the code.  

The attached simple patch does this.  Here are some timings on sage-4.6.1, with a speedup factor of 9:

BEFORE:

```
sage: p = 199
sage: fp = delta_qexp(prec=p^2+1, K=GF(p))
sage: timeit("tfp = hecke_operator_on_qexp(fp, p, 12)")
25 loops, best of 3: 22.7 ms per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: p = 199
sage: fp = delta_qexp(prec=p^2+1, K=GF(p))
sage: timeit("tfp = hecke_operator_on_qexp(fp, p, 12)")
125 loops, best of 3: 2.51 ms per loop
```

Thanks David!  You are completely right, the action on weight 1 forms is not given by the same formula.  I have modified the patch accordingly.

The already existing code should give the right result in weight 1.

Well, Z/49 does really have characteristic 49!

Perhaps the simplest thing to do is just detect prime characteristic and use the special code for powers of that, only.  Surely non-prime (positive) characteristic is not used a lot, so efficiency in that case is not crucial?
