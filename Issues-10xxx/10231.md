```
Right now, the version of the following packages is **always** bumped in every new Sage version:

```
sage
sage_scripts
extcode
examples
```

This patch will remove the last two from this list and shift the problem of upgrading these packages to the release manager (i.e. the merger script).

Keywords: **scripts upgrade extcode examples sd32**

I was always in the "for" camp. Unsurprisingly because it is less work for me.
I even suggest that the new version number of the spkg in question should be of the form {extcode,examples}-YYYYMMDD.

While there was no consensus on the list I suspect most people really don't care.

At least we meanwhile got rid of the "examples" spkg / repo, so the resistance may have been halved by that, too. ;-)

I wouldn't *delete* extcode's `spkg-dist` btw.; it doesn't hurt and can be used for testing / experimenting, or even still by a / the release manager.
