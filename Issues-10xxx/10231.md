Right now, the version of the following packages is **always** bumped in every new Sage version:

```
sage
sage_scripts
extcode
examples
```

This patch will remove the last two from this list and shift the problem of upgrading these packages to the release manager (i.e. the merger script).

I am very happy about that bit really.

extcode has seen some activity in 4.7.1 and is set to get some activity in 4.7.3  but we should think about these sage specific spkg that are seldom updated.

We got rid of examples what else is low on updates?
