The lapack version in Sage as of version `sage-4.6.alpha3` is `lapack-20071123.p1.spkg` This has several faults. 

* It's probably a CVS snapshot, as there's no version number, only a date.
* It's almost 3 years old, although several "stable" releases have been made since then. The latest is `lapack-3.2.2` released June 2010
* There's no spkg-check file
* The SPKG.txt file is only about 3 lines long, listing the package maintainers (Josh Kantor and William Stein). 
* The Mercurial repository is a mess - it's probably best to just delete it and make a new one, as it will serve no useful purpose.

Cc:ing myself and Jason.  

Also, just to be fair to previous people, this package must have last been updated long before there were coherent spkg policies :)

Does lapack have self-tests that an spkg-check could run?

True - to a certain extent, though a bit of common sense would have been in order. There's not much point having a mercurial repository, unless everything is are checked in.

I've not tried running any, but it looks like there is. Here's a few snippets from the Makefile

```
all: lapack_install lib lapack_testing blas_testing

lapack_testing:	lib
	( cd TESTING ; $(MAKE) )

```
