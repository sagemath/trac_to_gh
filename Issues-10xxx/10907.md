I get the following:

```
sage: K = QQ[x]
sage: f1 = K.random_element()
sage: f2 = K.random_element()
sage: f= f1*f2               
sage: F = factor(f)
sage: f-F
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '-': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field' and '<class 'sage.structure.factorization.Factorization'>'
sage: F-f
0
sage: f == F
False
sage: F in K
False
```

I think that at least f-F should work.

Note that (following on from the above)

```
sage: F - f
0
```

Including definitions for `__radd__` and `__rsub__` for the `sage.structure.factorization.Factorization` class should fix the `f - F` problem.

The other two results seem reasonable to me.

Wow, thanks!

The code is simple, a direct translation of __add__ and __sub__

The code passes doctest. The issue is fixed and I have tested the code in other situations (like different parent for the operands) and everithing works as expected.

Concerning the other issues I can live with them.

Positive review
