When you create the 3-dimensional permutahedron by hand (because one could use polytopes.permutahedron(4) instead), this yields an AttributeError. The `__init__` function of Polyhedron uses the function len(x), but it has been removed.

I don't see this as a bug; the input needs to be a list, so you should do:

sage: P=Polyhedron(list(Permutations([1,2,3,4])))

instead.  

I am open to counter-arguments but I am marking this "won't fix" for now.

I see! My bad!

That's perfect!
