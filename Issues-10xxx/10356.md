In Sage 4.6, I see 

```
sage: a=BipartiteGraph(matrix(2,2,[1,0,1,0]))
sage: a.show()
```

gives a graph where vertex "1" is not labeled (see attached picture).

Attachment: **[sage0.png.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10356/sage0.png.gz)**

It looks like there's a bigger problem here:

```
sage: a=BipartiteGraph(matrix(2,2,[1,0,1,0]))
sage: a
Bipartite graph on 3 vertices
sage: a.vertices()
[0, 2, 3]
```

It can't be a coincidence that the missing vertex in a.vertices() is also the vertex missing a label. Of course, this may raise the question of why the fourth vertex is being drawn in the first place; however, I don't know enough about how graphs are drawn to be certain of that.

The problem seems to be that the reduced adjacency matrix code does the following:

```
else:
    for ii in range(ncols):
        for jj in range(nrows):
            if arg1[jj][ii] != 0:
                self.add_edge((ii, jj + ncols))
```

This is fine if the graph is has no isolated vertices. However, any graphs with isolated vertices will cause the similar problems:

```
sage: n = matrix(4,4,[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
[1 1 1 1]
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0]
sage: g = BipartiteGraph(n)
sage: g
Bipartite graph on 5 vertices
sage: g.left, g.right
(set([0, 1, 2, 3]), set([4, 5, 6, 7]))
```
