IMHO **needs work**.

It's totally odd to dump the whole environment whenever `make something` is run, where `something` includes `doc`, `ptestlong` and most of all other targets.

I would
* make the output depend on some environment variable (*not* `SAGE_DEBUG` ;-) , but perhaps `SAGE_DEBUG_BUILD` to be also used elsewhere),
* limit the output to "relevant" variables; I e.g. personally use

```sh
printenv | egrep "SAGE|MAKE|CC|CXX|FLAG|LC|TMP|TEMP" | sort
```
 (which you would certainly extend I think),
* use `printenv`, the shell built-in, instead of `env`.


Sorry, had some "Sage-free Days"...

The "early exit" in my patch above is IMHO useful anyway, since always printing

```
To install gap, gp, singular, etc., scripts
in a standard bin directory, start sage and
type something like
   sage: install_scripts('/usr/local/bin')
at the Sage command prompt.

To build the documentation, run

Sage build/upgrade complete!
```

Replying to [leif](#comment%3A5):

Agreed.

> I would

Makes sense.

>  * limit the output to "relevant" variables; I e.g. personally use
 
Disagree, you never know in advance which environment variables are "relevant".  If a build fails, it might be because of some obscure environment variable.  That's why I added this patch.

>  * use `printenv`, the shell built-in, instead of `env`.
 
Disagree, `env` is more portable than `printenv`.

Edit your `~/.sagerc`.

Most of the environment is completely unrelated to Sage, and will annoy ordinary users.



We already had long discussions regarding the removal of (short!) useless messages like "*Building a 64-bit version of Sage*".



I'm also strongly in favour of first running `make -q` before (usually one-time) build-related messages are printed. `ptestlong` etc. are likely to be run much more often than a real (re)build is performed.

If you need it, you can add `ptestlong-debug` etc. targets to the top-level `Makefile`.

This is certainly true, but as I have said before: you never know in advance which environment variables are relevant, so better print them all.

Looks good to me.
