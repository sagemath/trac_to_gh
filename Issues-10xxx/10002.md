The file `sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` uses the GP interpreter for some computations.  It is probably more efficient to use the PARI library instead.

Applies fine to 4.6.1.alpha0.

It's a great idea to remove use of gp interpreter wherever possible.  And since one of my to-do items is to handle S-unit groups (and S-class groups) as well as we do unit and class groups, and this will help, I am all in favour -- thanks!

I tested all sage/rings/number_fields and sage/schemes/elliptic_curves (since 2-descent code uses S-units), and all pass.
