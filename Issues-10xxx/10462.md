I hate to be so pedantic, but you're missing a second colon -- ` EXAMPLES:` should be `EXAMPLES::` on the docstring for <code> \`__call__\` </code>. (I'm being doubly harsh since this module isn't in the reference manual and underscore methods don't get picked up by the sphinx parser anyway, but both of these things might cease to be true in the future...) 

I would fix that myself, but then we'd have to get someone else to review it; if you supply the missing colon, I'll happily give this patch a positive review.
