The attached patch is a massive clean-up of the documentation and doctests in the module `sage/misc/bitset.pyx`. Here's a summary of what's in the patch:

* Add the title "Bitset" as the title of the module. When generating the documentation with Sphinx, this name would become the title of the module in the generated documentation.
* Many typo fixes and remove trailing white spaces.
* Format code according to PEP 008 wherever possible.
* Raise exceptions according to the style of Python 3.x.
* Add lots more doctests to the class documentation of `FrozenBitset`.
* Move input, output documentation from `__init__` in `FrozenBitset` to the class documentation. This should make the documentation for input and output appear in the reference manual.
* Cross reference `FrozenBitset` and `Bitset`; provide link to Python's set types in the Python library reference.
* Explain the string representation of `FrozenBitset` and `Bitset`.
* Get `issubset`, `issuperset` and `isdisjoint` to propagate exceptions; previously those methods ignored any exceptions raised.
* Illustrate difference between length and capacity of a bitset. 
* For `FrozenBitset`, doctests for `None` type in comparison, containment, union, or, intersection, and, difference, symmetric difference, xor.
* For `Bitset`, tests for `None` type in `update`, `intersection_update`, `difference_update`, `symmetric_difference_update`; tests for invalid input to `add`, `remove`, `discard`.

I'm not sure what it is that you want me to modify in my patch. Do you want me to remove it? Do you want me to make some clarification in the document? The purpose of the block within which that example is found is to demonstrate different ways of constructing the empty bitset. If you want some more clarification, I have added the following examples to my patch:

* `FrozenBitet(tuple())`
* `FrozenBitet(list())`

See the ticket description for instruction on which patch to apply.



Also note that in the current implementation of `FrozenBitset`, the constructor doesn't accept the empty string. Passing the empty string to the constructor of `FrozenBitset` would result in a `MemoryError`. This is fixed in both of my patches. My intention is to say that passing the empty string to the constructor of `FrozenBitset` would result in the empty bitset.

Wow, great patch ! Thank you Minh ! And thanks to whoever wrote this wonderful bitset class in the first place ! I'm making great use of it these days `:-)`

Just two things :

* First, the patch does not apply on rc1, but that's just because of 2 short documentation lines
* In the documentation the variable "iter" represents an iterable from which the FrozenBitset can be created... In Python's terminology, is an iterator an iterable ? Because in this case checking its length may be a bad idea... And converting it to a list too perhaps. Well, short of these two things, this patch is good to go (and great, being Minh's work)
