Right now, the followinjg is happening 

```python
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.dominating_set()
IBM ILOG License Manager: "IBM ILOG Optimization Suite for Academic Initiative" is accessing CPLEX 12 with option(s): "e m b q ".
[4, 6, 7]
sage: g.dominating_set(solver = "GLPK")

   5667         else:

   5669             b=p.get_values(b)

/home/ncohen/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/numerical/mip.so in sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve (sage/numerical/mip.c:5813)()

ValueError: Solver argument deprecated. This parameter now has to be set when calling the class' constructor
```

The new interface between Sage and the LP solvers requires the solver's name to be given when the constructor is called.

This patch applied, all is fine :

```python
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.dominating_set()
IBM ILOG License Manager: "IBM ILOG Optimization Suite for Academic Initiative" is accessing CPLEX 12 with option(s): "e m b q ".
[4, 6, 7]
sage: g.dominating_set(solver = "GLPK")
[0, 2, 6]
```

Apply first :

* #10043
* #10101
* #9698
* #9581
* #10150

This long list of undeserved dependencies is here to prevent this patch from having to be rebased, as it touches many files almost everywhere.

Well, the "default solver" is already automatically picked as the best among those installed. Cplex is taken if available, then Coin, then GLPK (default, always there).. This is mainly for checking that the results are coherent when the solver changes... 

How do you think such a global option should be set/read ?.. I do not know the custom for this in Sage `^^;`

Sure, you pick the overall best, but for a particular problem another one might be better and it would be nice to force a particular solver. Another application would be benchmarketing.

I'd suggest this user interface:

```python
sage: default_mip_solver()
'Coin'
sage: default_mip_solver('GLPK')
sage: default_mip_solver()
'GLPK'
```

Well, then for a *particular* problem the ``solver`` parameter should be the perfect answer, wouldn't it ? `:-p`

I'll be writing this patch, it shouldn't take long `:-)`

```python
variable = False

def foo():

I think

```python
:meth:`default_mip_solver` -- Returns/Sets the default MIP solver. 
```
should be `:func:`. 

Other than that, the patch looks good. So once all doctests pass and this is fixed, I'm happy to give this patch a positive review.
