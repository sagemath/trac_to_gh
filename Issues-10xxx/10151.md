ValueError: Solver argument deprecated. This parameter now has to be set when calling the class' constructor
```

The new interface between Sage and the LP solvers requires the solver's name to be given when the constructor is called.

This patch applied, all is fine :

```python
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.dominating_set()
IBM ILOG License Manager: "IBM ILOG Optimization Suite for Academic Initiative" is accessing CPLEX 12 with option(s): "e m b q ".
[4, 6, 7]
sage: g.dominating_set(solver = "GLPK")
[0, 2, 6]
```

Apply first :

* #10043
* #10101
* #9698
* #9581
* #10150

This long list of undeserved dependencies is here to prevent this patch from having to be rebased, as it touches many files almost everywhere.

Well, the "default solver" is already automatically picked as the best among those installed. Cplex is taken if available, then Coin, then GLPK (default, always there).. This is mainly for checking that the results are coherent when the solver changes... 

How do you think such a global option should be set/read ?.. I do not know the custom for this in Sage `^^;`

Well, then for a *particular* problem the ``solver`` parameter should be the perfect answer, wouldn't it ? `:-p`

I think

```
should be `:func:`. 

Other than that, the patch looks good. So once all doctests pass and this is fixed, I'm happy to give this patch a positive review.
