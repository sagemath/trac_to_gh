Here are some [upstream examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/images_contours_and_fields/streamplot_demo_features.html).

---
Here is another example from somewhere in this discussion, allowing phase plots.  Not directly related but looks nice with such things.

```
# based on code from oddrobot, http://sagenb.org/home/pub/1532/
from sage.calculus.desolvers import desolve_system_rk4
x,y,t=var('x y t')
class DESolution:
    def __init__(self,system,time_range,initial,stepsize=0.05):
        
        self.tvar=time_range[0]
        self._times=srange(time_range[1],time_range[2],stepsize)
        self.vars=[v for v,_ in initial]
        self.dim=len(self.vars)
        self._soln=desolve_odeint(system, ics=[v for _,v in initial], times=self._times, dvars=self.vars, ivar=self.tvar)
        
    def phase_plot(self,vars=None,color='blue',**kwargs):
        # find which indices the specified variables are
        if vars is not None:
            vars_index=[self.vars.index(v) for v in vars]
        elif self.dim<=3:
            vars_index=range(self.dim)
        else:
            vars_index=range(2)
            
        p=line(self._soln[:,vars_index],color=color,**kwargs)
        # add an arrow head showing which way we are going around the phase line
        half=int(self._soln.shape[0]/2)
        p+=arrow(self._soln[half,vars_index], self._soln[half+1,vars_index],color=color)
        if len(vars_index)==2:
            p.axes_labels([str(self.vars[v]) for v in vars_index])
        return p
        
    def coordinates(self,colors=None,**kwargs):
        if colors is None:
            colors=rainbow(len(self.vars))
        p=Graphics()
        p+=sum(line(zip(self._times,self._soln[:,i]), color=colors[i], legend_label=str(self.vars[i]),**kwargs) for i in range(self.dim))
        return p

The idea of a convenience function that switches between streamline and vector/slope plots is interesting, but shouldn't be part of `streamline_plot` itself.

Some of the examples from `plot_field.py` had to be left out of this new file because `streamplot` returned errors for them.

Would this convenience function be used regularly by others, or just you for one class? What's the rule of thumb for adding those sorts of features to Sage?

If you still want an additional convenience function added to this file, give me a name for it and its options.

Yes, but how I am reading the code, it looks like it does streamlines starting at each integer point.

> What more do you intend with this feature?

Plot a solution for a given IVP.

> The idea of a convenience function that switches between streamline and vector/slope plots is interesting, but shouldn't be part of `streamline_plot` itself. That one should stand alone, partly because the `streamplot` function it uses behaves differently from the `quiver` function used by the others.

If you look at the slope plot, it redirects to the vector plot with special options. We should be able to automate this by looking at the input, a tuple for a vector plot and otherwise consider it a slope plot.

> Would this convenience function be used regularly by others, or just you for one class? What's the rule of thumb for adding those sorts of features to Sage?

I would be surprised if this did not get significant uptake in a variety of other classes. One of my first forays into Python was plotting a single streamline for the Lorenz attractor. However, there are a number of things in Sage that are likely only used by a few people, so the rule is it gets added if someone is willing to positively review it.

> If you still want an additional convenience function added to this file, give me a name for it and its options.

Granted, I would eventually like a 3d version, but that can most certainly be a followup ticket.

I should have time next week to actually directly work on this (i.e. write code).

Travis, I went through the existing options, removed those that are not accepted by `streamplot` and added one that is, `density`. This value must be a single float or a pair of floats in a list, although I haven't added any validation for input values. It will at least allow you to see more streamlines and verify that they do not always start at integers.

There is another `streamplot` option I though might be interesting called `start_points`, but all it does is restrict streamlines to only those passing through an input list of points. You can test it by adding an option `start_points=[[0,.1],[0,-.1]]` or the like. Doesn't look too interesting to me.

This value must be a single float or a pair of floats in a list, although I haven't added any validation for input values.

I added some input checking, but `density` will still need to be documented.

> There is another `streamplot` option I though might be interesting called `start_points`, but all it does is restrict streamlines to only those passing through an input list of points. You can test it by adding an option `start_points=[[0,.1],[0,-.1]]` or the like. Doesn't look too interesting to me.

It is useful for showing numerical solutions to initial value problems (IVPs) of (nonlinear) ODEs. Also useful for seeing how stable solutions are. Although it is very annoying that it can't plot start points that are too close together:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: f = (x + y) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
sage: pts = [[-1., -2.+val/8] for val in range(10)]
sage: streamline_plot((cos(x), sin(x+y)), (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), start_points=pts)
/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py:590: RichReprWarning: Exception in _rich_repr_ while displaying object: 
  RichReprWarning,
Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
Although this is not something that would (nor should) block this getting a positive review.

I disagree with adding `start_points` to the `@options`, where if that is changed, it is perpetuated in all future plots, which is not what we want. I will revert this back when I make my next round of changes.

Does the "official way" for `start_points` make any difference?

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment:32):
> Does the "official way" for `start_points` make any difference?

Not that I can tell. `xpos_array` and `ypos_array` need to be explicit numpy arrays to avoid errors. The documentation says that `start_points` is also supposed to be a numpy array, so I added this block of commented code in case that is ever enforced, but you can remove it if you feel that is more appropriate.
