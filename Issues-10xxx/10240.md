In spkg-install, the following code should check for "libpari.dll" on Cygwin.

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    pari_shlib="libpari.dylib"
else
    pari_shlib="libpari.so"
fi
```

The (trivial) fix is here:

Yes.  However, I am working on a new PARI spkg at #11130 (still needs work currently).  I could merge this change into that new PARI spkg.

Dima's spkg worked on XP for me - PARI built.  And the part of the spkg diff at #11130 looks correct.  

Is that enough for a positive review?

I've based a p7 spkg at #11605 (which hopefully gets into Sage 4.7**.1** because it fixes a critical error in `spkg-install`) on the p6 from here, i.e. it includes Dima's harmless changes.

If my spkg gets merged, this ticket can be closed as fixed.
