while trying to improve the coverage of `matrix/matrix_dense.pyx`,
we noticed with Marc Fuentes that the function
`_multiply_classical` from that file is dead code.
Indeed, all instances of that function in other files are locally
defined, and it seems impossible to exhibit a test which calls that
function. We therefore propose to remove that dead code.

Indeed, after removing that function, all doctests still pass.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Passes -testall -long, and it's a private method anyway... So I guess it's safe to let it go `:-)`
