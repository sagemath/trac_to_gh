while trying to improve the coverage of `matrix/matrix_dense.pyx`,
we noticed with Marc Fuentes that the function

```
_multiply_classical}}} from that file is dead code.
Indeed, all instances of that function in other files are locally
defined, and it seems impossible to exhibit a test which calls that
function. We therefore propose to remove that dead code.

Indeed, after removing that function, all doctests still pass.

Passes -testall -long, and it's a private method anyway... So I guess it's safe to let it go `:-)`
