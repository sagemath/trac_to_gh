The Weil pairing implementation in Sage is horribly inefficient when the group order n is a cryptographically large composite integer.

The implementation is based on Miller's algorithm, which in its original version is a polynomial time algorithm, capable of handling large composite values of n.  However, the Sage implementation attempts to determine the order of the input points P and Q.  The problem of determining the order of a point on an elliptic curve of large composite order is conjectured to be computationally infeasible (Boneh-Goh-Nissim TCC'05), and all known methods for solving this problem require factoring n.

Therefore, by adding the order computation, the Weil pairing calculation is transformed from a polynomial time algorithm to a superpolynomial time algorithm requiring the factorization of n.

I propose to delete the code block that contains the order computation, since the order computation is not useful when n is prime, and is inefficient when n is composite.  Note that we still check to ensure P and Q are n-torsion -- this patch simply deletes the code to compute their exact order.  The attached file implements this change.

That's a very sensible thing to do. That is, don't just delete bad code, but comment it out and provide an explanation why it shouldn't be used.

I updated the patch to comment out the code, and added the explanation as well.

This will create a patch in $(hg root)/.hg/patches with the appropriate filename which you can just upload directly, as well as committing to the local hg repository.

This will automatically update your patch file (and the commit mq had made to the repository), which is easier than having to undo and redo normal Mercurial commits. You can actually create more patches with `hg qnew` after pushing your first one, which will then be calculated with the first patch as a base, etc. etc. - run `hg help mq` for more info.\n\nHope that helps you as much as it helped me.",
