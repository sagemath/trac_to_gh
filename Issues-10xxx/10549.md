<a id='comment:3'></a>Sorry, that should have been lines 13808--13814.

Same thing also on line 14347.

Another problem is that copying graph backends is not currently implemented. However, it may seem to be when the line `G._backend = copy( g._backend )` executes without error. It seems to be simply copying the link address:

```
sage: G = Graph(sparse=True)
sage: G.add_edges( [(0,1,'a'),(1,2,'b'),(2,3,'c'),(3,4,'b'),(4,0,'a')] )
sage: G.num_verts()
5
sage: X = G.canonical_label(edge_labels=True)
sage: G.num_verts()
10
```

So that really needs to be fixed.

Also, this could have better coding style: `for i in [ v for v in g if v not in G_vertices ]:`. This could be `for i in g if i not in G_vertices:`, as there is no need to construct a list there.

I now only make G = copy( g ), so this is again quite slow. But I don't see a better way to do it, do you?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hellooooooo !!

Only two errors in a -testall -long :

```python
sage -t -long sage-bug/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
**********************************************************************
File "/home/ncohen/sage/devel/sage-bug/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 14686:
    sage: G.is_isomorphic(H, edge_labels=True)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "/home/ncohen/sage/devel/sage-bug/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 14688:
    sage: G.is_isomorphic(H, edge_labels=True, certify=True)
Expected:
    {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 0}
Got:
    (False, None)
**********************************************************************
```

(I'm running the latest alpha1)

By the way : would you know of a "cheap/elegant" way to deal with this :

```python
sage: g = graphs.KneserGraph(8,2)
sage: h = g.copy()
sage: %timeit g.is_isomorphic(h)
125 loops, best of 3: 6.27 ms per loop
sage: h.relabel()
sage: %timeit g.is_isomorphic(h)
125 loops, best of 3: 4.72 ms per loop
sage: g.relabel()
sage: %timeit g.is_isomorphic(h)
125 loops, best of 3: 3.13 ms per loop
```

Or is it just because of the way labels are handled ?
