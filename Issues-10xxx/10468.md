At #10467, I had some example of a computation of a symmetric Gr√∂bner basis of an ideal in an infinite polynomial ring; the patch there provided quite a speedup.

However, I found that the actual reason for the original slowness is the fact that in the method `tensor_with_ring`, the `InfinitePolynomialRing` constructor is not used. Therefore, (a) the cache breaks, and (b) much time is wasted by creating the same infinite polynomial ring over and over again. Here is a new patch, independent of #10467, solving the issue.

Without the patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R.tensor_with_ring(QQ) is R
False
sage: I = R.ideal([x[1]^2+y[2]*y[3], x[2]*y[1]*x[3]-y[1]*y[2]])
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 23.09 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 23.11 s
Wall time: 23.67 s
[y_2*y_1^3 + y_2*y_1^2, y_2^2*y_1 - y_2*y_1^2, y_3*y_1 - y_2*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1^2 + x_1*y_2*y_1, x_1^2 + y_2*y_1, x_2*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_3 - y_2*y_1, x_3*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_3*x_1*y_2 - y_2*y_1, x_3*x_2*y_1 - y_2*y_1]
```

With the new patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R.tensor_with_ring(QQ) is R
True
sage: I = R.ideal([x[1]^2+y[2]*y[3], x[2]*y[1]*x[3]-y[1]*y[2]])
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 1.68 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.70 s
Wall time: 2.17 s
[y_2*y_1^3 + y_2*y_1^2, y_2^2*y_1 - y_2*y_1^2, y_3*y_1 - y_2*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1^2 + x_1*y_2*y_1, x_1^2 + y_2*y_1, x_2*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_3 - y_2*y_1, x_3*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_3*x_1*y_2 - y_2*y_1, x_3*x_2*y_1 - y_2*y_1]
```

The fix is doc tested.
