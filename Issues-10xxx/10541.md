<div id="comment:0"></div>

A vector is naturally a single-row matrix or a single-column matrix.  There is an implicit assumption in Sage that the former is more desirable.  These patches aim to put the two options on even footing, while also making the conversion of the type perhaps more obvious.

See the [discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/623226316555c28e) on sage-devel.

First patch:  implements .row() and .column() for vectors, as suggested by Jason Grout.  There is a nice symmetry with the commands .row(i) and .column(i) for matrices, see the doctests.  Also allows sparseness to be preserved.

Second patch: deprecates .transpose() which presumes rows are preferable and has its functionality exactly duplicated by .column().  Called once in a number field doctest, apparently for purely cosmetic reasons.  Called once in polyhedra code, presumably in an outer product (which should also be a new method for vectors).  Details on this in a comment.

Thanks, Jeroen.

I know I tested this against the whole Sage library when I built it, and I just tested it against 4.6.1.alpha3 on the Sage library code with no failures.  So maybe it is premature bitrot?

I need to get my dev tree caught up to the latest alpha, and then I will test this again against *everything* and track down the problem.

Sorry for the trouble.

Failures are due to some new "transposes" of vectors that slipped into 4.6.2.alpha2 as part of #727.  Latest patch changes those to columns, so doctests now pass in all of `sage/schemes`.

Marco - do you want to check-off on just the changes in the latest patch?  Localized to just the `diagonal_matrix()` method in `con_field.py`.  Thanks.

Needs all three patches for full testing.

Hi Marco,

Thanks for attention to this - I was going to get back to it later tonight.

In Sage, a vector does not have an orientation, just an implicit assumption that it should be treated like a row of a matrix if you *have* to make a decision.  I am trying to make the linear algebra code much easier for beginners to use, and then integrating all that into my open-source introductory textbook.  You can see progress so far at:
http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/LatexToWorksheet

So I feel strongly that just having a "vector transpose" is a source of confusion, and instead having row() and a column() methods will make it much more clear what is happening - and column() is a drop-in replacement.  This came up at:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/623226316555c28e/

You will see from the deprecation patch that `.transpose()` was hardly ever used anywhere.

I do not think the doctest in question is incorrect.  It wasn't failing was it?  Patch implements `.row()` which converts a vector to a 1 x n matrix.  So an empty vector should become a 1 x 0 matrix as a row.  Maybe you would like a similar test for `.column()`?  And maybe that would be better than the one that is there.  Maybe having both would be the best solution.

Hi Rob,

Thanks for the explanation. I know most of that already, and personally do agree with it.

On the other hand, some people may have used vector `transpose` a lot in their own code, or be strongly opposed to this change for other reasons. You did ask if there were any objections, but that was in the middle of a long thread with title 'Adjoint of a matrix'. I'm not sure if people got enough chance to object.


> I do not think the doctest in question is incorrect.  It wasn't failing was it?


It wasn't incorrect in that sense, it just occurred twice, and tested the wrong function in the second occurrence. Both `.row()` and `.column()` have the same doctest

```
sage: v = vector(ZZ, []) 
sage: w = v.row() 
sage: w.parent() 
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 0 dense matrices over Integer Ring 
```
It would make more sense to replace `v.row()` by `v.column()` in the doctest of `column` instead of repeating the doctest of `row`. I assumed that is what you meant to do in your first patch, so it is what I did in mine.

Marco

as a positive review for my own (trivial) patch.

Hi Marco,

Thanks again for the catch on the doctest and understanding the dangerous waters of deprecating *anything*.  ;-)  It will, of course, be easy to rollback this deprecation and downgrade it to some sort of advisory in the documentation.  I'll be at this project for some time, so I'll keep an eye on it.

Conflict comes from new code in #9918 as of 4.6.2.alpha3.

Latest patch converts an outer product to `v.column()*v.row()`, so tests now pass in the affected file.

Volker - do you want to check-off on this change to your code?  You might also like the outer-product method waiting at #10545.  ;-)
