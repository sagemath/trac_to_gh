**Attachment:** [trac_10485-reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10485/trac_10485-reviewer.patch.gz)

This adds to the documentation of crystals in the Lie thematic tutorial. It must be merged simultaneously with #10632 (and after #10723). When all three patches #10723, #10632 and #10485 are merged, all doctests pass with sage-4.7.alpha1. The patches have been extensively reviewed in sage-combinat-devel and appropriately revised.

The reviewer patch adds acknowledgement of one NSF grant, which should have been cited in #8442.
