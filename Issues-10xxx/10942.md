#7377 has factored out general interfaces from pexpect interfaces, and now provides two separate ways to interact with Maxima.  However, the ReST files are a little behind the times, and don't include these files.  

Rather than burden that ticket with even more bureaucracy, we move this to another ticket; the pexpect interfaces still work as advertised in the current reference manual, so there is nothing wrong per se about them.  There is just additional flexibility now.
