Right now, the Spherical transform documented here:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html#sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d.Spherical

only allows specifying an inclination angle.  Some applications (like lattitude and longitude) deal with the elevation angle.  It would be great if the spherical transform allowed one to either use 'inclination' or 'elevation' to represent the angle out of the xy plane.

** n.b. this is my first contribution of new code to Sage ** 

I've implemented the spherical coordinate system which uses elevation instead of inclination. This is a new class called ``SphericalElevation``. Initially, I wanted to simply change the ``Spherical`` class so that it would accept 'elevation' as a variable instead of 'inclination'. This didn't seem to be possible in the existing framework (as a base class of ``_Coordinates``) since the constructor checks the variable names against the arguments specified in the transform method, so a separate transform method is needed in any case (?).

I've included similar examples to those under ``Spherical`` along with some new ones which illustrate the difference between ``Sphereical Elevation`` and ``Spherical``. I made sure that the doctests pass and that all the examples included work as expected. 

Comments & suggestions are appreciated.
