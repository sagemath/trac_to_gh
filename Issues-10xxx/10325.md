I really really don't like this:

```
sage: X2.toric_divisor_group().scheme() is X2
False
```
It seems to me that either schemes must be unique as well, or their divisor groups should be separate. I think that the second option makes more sense since schemes are "the main ones" and divisor groups automatically will be unique if their schemes decide to be uniqie.

However this is not the problem of toric varieties only, other schemes are also non-unique while divisor groups are. In the long run it should be taken care of, but for now the attached patch offers a partial solution and I don't think that it creates any new problems. So positive review, I'll open a new ticket for the bigger problem.

As I concluded from some discussions on sage-combinat, `FormalSum` which is used as a base for divisor groups should eventually be deprecated as `CombinatorialFreeModule` is the new way to go. Perhaps sometime we can do the switch and free derived objects from uniqueness decisions.
