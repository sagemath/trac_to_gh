`sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3dGroup` is a disaster waiting to happen from the command line, because some such graphics (naturally occurring) have many, many components, and there is an attribute which opens a separate Jmol for each one. 

That is,

```
sage: x,y,z=var('x y z')
sage: plot_vector_field3d((x*cos(z),-y*cos(z),sin(z)), (x,0,pi), (y,0,pi), (z,0,pi))
```
is fine, but

```
sage: P = plot_vector_field3d((x*cos(z),-y*cos(z),sin(z)), (x,0,pi), (y,0,pi), (z,0,pi))
sage: P.all()
```
opens 125 new Jmol windows, as far as I can tell.  Needless to say, this makes doing anything at all - even closing those windows - nearly impossible, even on a modern machine.  Good thing I didn't use more plot points!

A good test case is 

```
sage: P = plot_vector_field3d((x*cos(z),-y*cos(z),sin(z)), (x,0,pi), (y,0,pi), (z,0,pi),plot_points=2)
sage: P

sage: P.all
[, , , , , , , ]
```
The reason I consider this major is because it's not obvious how to access the all the sub-pieces of a 3d plot, and someone might try this and get very nasty results.

Hopefully, a simple fix to this can fix it.  I'm actually surprised I can access this internal attribute, when I often can't for other Sage objects... 

```
class Graphics3dGroup(Graphics3d):
    """
    This class represents a collection of 3d objects. Usually they are formed
    implicitly by summing.
    """
    def __init__(self, all=(), rot=None, trans=None, scale=None, T=None):
        """
<snip>
        """
        self.all = list(all)
```

Another solution would be to change how 3D vector fields are implemented and then make sure nothing has that many things in all, but that seems less desirable.
