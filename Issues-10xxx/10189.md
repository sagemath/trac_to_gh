This ticket began with building an all-ones matrix constructor, as contained on the first patch.  But that was already happening over on #9685.

New title, new decription, new patch are about adding onto the `ones_matrix` constructor.  Specifically,


1.  Significant additions to the documentation.

2.  Setting `nrows=None` in the function definition allows for a call with just a single integer entry, producing a square matrix over the integers, similar to the behavior for `identity_matrix`.  Requires one new error-check.

3.  Isn't it better to coerce a generic 1 into the ring and then use that to populate the matrix?  I've done that.

Thanks, KDC.  Was just too sloppy and forgot the bullets.

Tried to work on this and discovered a `ones_matrix` constructor was merged into 4.6.1.alpha1 at #9685!  Guess I was not paying attention as well, since it was over in "user interface."  Looks like Robert Miller did like I did and cribbed from the `zero_matrix` constructor, so I think there is not much difference between his and mine.

I do have an INPUT block in my documentation, even if it needs work.  ;-)  Should I steal from my work here and slightly improve the already-merged version?  I've cc'ed the folks on the previous ticket.

Might as well do the same thing for the `zero_matrix` et al. as well.

I see no reason why this ticket shouldn't be renamed to reflect this new purpose...
