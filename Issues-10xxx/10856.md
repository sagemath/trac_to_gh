At #1819 Volker Braun suggested:

* An alias `MPolynomialIdeal.basis` = `MPolynomialIdeal.gens`
* `Move MPolynomialIdeal.basis_is_groebner` to `PolynomialSequence.is_groebner`
* `Move MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis` to   `PolynomialSequence.interreduce`.
* there shouldn't be a `PolynomialSequence.groebner_basis`
