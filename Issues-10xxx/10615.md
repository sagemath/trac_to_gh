From #10244 (perhaps elsewhere), there is discussion about unifying plot options along the lines of toric plotting options' unification at #9644.  novoselt suggests something along the lines of `plot.options(xmin=-10, xmax=10, color="red")` to affect future session commands.  See discussion there for more details which would crowd this description.
