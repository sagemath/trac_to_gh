The `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` has a here document that creates `pipestatus`. With the sage root repository, this is no longer needed as `pipestatus` is tracked by the repository. The patch removes it from `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install`.

I've recently played around with automatic testing upgrades and I think this might break upgrades. Its really a bigger issue, the sage_root repository is only upgraded rather late in the upgrade process. I think this needs to be fixed first. I will do some more testing when I have time.

I'll set this ticket to "needs info" until I (or somebody else) tests upgrading.

Those were exactly my thoughts, too. 

I was mostly motivated by #11073. We can't stuff all files in the spkg/base repo into a here document :-) 

Do we have an official policy on how old a Sage version should still be able to upgrade?

I declare "1 year" as the official policy, since that's the official policy for deprecation.  I think it is a reasonable amount of time. 

Since sage-4.5.3 had pipestatus, and was released 2010-09-08 and the next sage release won't be for two weeks (or so), it is fine to deprecate upgrading from pre sage-4.5.3 releases.

We do test upgrading on various systems from various Sage versions and we almost never have problems.

Anothe question is: is upgrading really used?  I mean, do normal Sage users sometimes do `sage -upgrade`?  If not, then why do we support upgrading?

We should be worried that (or why they feel) upgrading doesn't work for them though. I guess they just didn't try since last year (when it started working better). ;-)

---

However, I see no real point in (or any compelling reason for) removing `pipestatus`' creation.

If we do so, despite of that it [just] breaks upgrading from older releases, `spkg/install` should give an appropriate error message in case `pipestatus` isn't already present. Unfortunately this would happen **after** dozens of spkgs to upgrade have been downloaded, which is a bit odd.

If at all, we IMHO should remove it in some *"major"* release, like e.g. Sage 5.0, or perhaps Sage 4.8, since people are probably less likely to upgrade to such a version (with `-upgrade`), or at least more likely to read its release notes in advance.

Should I? (And I'm not aware Volker does; I also didn't hear François complaining about `pipestatus`' creation, but maybe I just missed it.)

I still think removing `pipestatus` for no reason at this point is simply superfluous.

The patch should IMHO *at least* test for `pipestatus`'s presence, and issue *an appropriate* error message (with instructions how to fix this) if it doesn't exist; though quite late in the upgrade process, i.e. *after* all updated packages have been downloaded, of course.

P.S.: We could even attempt to download it (with e.g. `curl` or `wget`) from the script. Or install the root repository "manually" in advance on upgrading, of course from the updated `spkg/install`, since the other scripts are those of the old version.

sage: An error occurred while installing boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/sage-4.6/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/sage-4.6/spkg/build/boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0 and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/sage-4.6/spkg/build/boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0' && '/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/sage-4.6/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.
make: *** [installed/boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p0] Error 1
