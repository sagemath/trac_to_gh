Graphs can be visualized in Sage in a number of ways: plot, plot3d,
native export as latex, export as latex using dot2tex, ...

Those are currently implemented mostly independently of each
other. The main impact on the user is that the customization options
(labels on edges, colors, ...) differ quite a lot (naming scheme,
avaialable options, ...).

The natural fix would be to factor out as much as possible of the
customization option code. This would also lead to smaller and easier
to maintain code as well. This will require a brainstorm (typically
during some Sage Day) to choose a uniform scheme for customization
options, if needed at the price of breaking backward compatibility in
some corner cases.
