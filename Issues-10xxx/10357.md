This is a duplicate of #9807.

If a graph allows loops, then merge_vertices maybe should have an option to put a loop on the merged vertex if there was either an edge between the vertices, or maybe if the merged vertices formed a complete graph, so the following would make a loop in the graph:

```
g=graphs.PathGraph(2)
g.allow_loops(True)
g.merge_vertices([0,1])
g.edges()
```


In my case, I'm merging two vertices, so either case would be the same thing.
