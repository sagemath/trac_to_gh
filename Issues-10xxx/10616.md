Even after #10244 and #7871, the following still doesn't work:

```
sage: Q = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$')
sage: Q = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$',legend_back_color=(1,0,0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
/Users/.../sage-4.6.1.rc1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/plot/line.pyc in __init__(self, xdata, ydata, options)
     46         for opt in options.iterkeys():
     47             if opt not in valid_options:
---> 48                 raise RuntimeError("Error in line(): option '%s' not valid."%opt)
     49         self.xdata = xdata
     50         self.ydata = ydata

RuntimeError: Error in line(): option 'legend_back_color' not valid.
```
Note that using `set_legend_options()` does work, so the issue is in the (as yet not doctested) claim that `legend_*` should work as an option, which apparently isn't true, at least not all the time.

Actually, we should really make sure the suboptions decorator works in general, but this is the only place I know of it not behaving as advertised.
