One can use the big-oh notation

O(x<sup>n</sup>)

when x is a generator of a power series or a laurent series. It is convenient to also be able to use this notation when the parent of x is another ring (for example, a subclass of a power series ring).

The current implementation in `rings/big_oh.py` imports a large number of types, which slows down the Sage startup.  Elements should implement their own big_oh() methods, and the function `O(x)` should simply call `x.big_oh()`.
