Would it be possible to copy the `matrix_double_dense.pyx` `is_hermitian` into `matrix_dense.pyx` (adjusting the default tolerance and doctests, of course) and thus remove the quirk that makes this warning necessary?

Hi Felix,

This sounds like a good idea.

* I'd imagine the code in matrix2 branching for exact vs. inexact rings.  Any tolerance would be ignored for exact rings.

* Are RDF/CDF/RR/CC the only inexact rings in Sage?  They need to be amenable to an absolute value in order to do the comparison.  As organized in the patch, we at least know just which ring we are dealing with.

* Same idea would apply to `is_symmetric` and `is_unitary`.

* I'm guessing this will change some behavior if applied to is_symmetric.  In other words, I bet the exact version gets called for some inexact rings.  I may test this later.

BTW, I saw your post on sage-devel asking for greater `SciPY/NumPy` integration.  I'm hoping to (slowly) make more of the matrix algebra available, so maybe that will help.

Jason - any comments on the above?

Rob

If the parameter is there, don't ignore it.  That would be really confusing.

```
sage: SR.is_exact()
False
```


In fact, there are an infinite number of inexact rings:

```
sage: RealField(100).is_exact()
False
sage: S.<s> = LaurentSeriesRing(GF(5))
sage: T.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(pAdicRing(5))
sage: T.is_exact()
False
```


There probably many, many more.

That's the one that would bite me.  I knew there was one oddball one.

Thanks, that's what I needed to know.  (I use RR/CC as stand-ins for all the `RealField()`'s.)

So this will be a problem:

```
sage: T.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(pAdicRing(5))
sage: a=T.an_element()
sage: a
(1 + O(5^20))*t
sage: abs(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/sage/dev/devel/sage-main/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly'
```

Which is making me think it would be better to make the annoying message go away by "somebody" implementing matrices over RR/CC/RealField()/ComplexField() properly.

v5 patch is self-contained, apply only this one.

Two options for the check, the naive one, or one based on the Schur decomposition (#11027).

This needs to check that the upper half of a matrix is zero, so I broke out a helper method for that, since I'll use it in a future `is_normal()` method.  I might pair it with an upper-triangular check at some point and make them both visible.  But not as part of this.

v6 adds caching the exact version's result, and fixes some (more) off-by-one problems with the old-style loops.  Cython now efficiently translates `range`s so I just went with those.  I think I am done.  Really.

I think the description may be for the release manager, and the buildbot reads comments.

Also, the buildbot is "stuck" back at 4.6.2.  Maybe the following will help.

Does anybody here remember why `numpy.absolute(numpy.imag(z))` is called on a `CDF` element `z` instead of simply `abs(z.imag())`? The former breaks with numpy 1.13 and I'm changing the code to the latter on #24063.
