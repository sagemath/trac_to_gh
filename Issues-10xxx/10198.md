<a id='comment:1'></a>
Now (in Sage-5.1.beta0) we get

```
sage: Hom(ProjectiveSpace(3), ProjectiveSpace(1))
Set of morphisms
  From: Projective Space of dimension 3 over Integer Ring
  To:   Projective Space of dimension 1 over Integer Ring
```
which is more sensible. So this ticket can be closed.
