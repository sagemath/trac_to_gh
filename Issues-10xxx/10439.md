Giving the `vector()` constructor both a degree and elements given as a dictionary will not work properly as is.

But if `sage.modules.free_module_element.prepare_dict()` accepted the degree as an optional argument and was smarter, this should would be possible without much more work, and would be an improvement over having to give a terminal zero to get the degree right.  See #10364 for more explicit discussion.
