In several places in the documentation it says you shouldn't close tickets if you aren't a release manager. Since it's so trivial to fix maybe we should change the rights needed to change the status of a ticket in order to prevent unknown people from closing tickets. According to [the trac wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWorkflow) this can be done by changing `close.permissions = TICKET_MODIFY` to `close.permissions = TICKET_ADMIN` in the `trac.ini` file. Of course `TICKET_ADMIN` could be anything logical from [the possible permission set](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPermissions).

We could even do more fancy stuff like add a "nominate for closure" status to the workflow or a "request patchbot" and a "patchbot doctest passed" depending on how the development workflow is in real life.

Hej Jeroen, Are you sure you cannot close tickets. I looked at the permissions and we have exactly the same permissions, yet I was able to close this ticket. (This is also how I tested if you would still be able to close tickets, since that would be very! important)

Kind Regards

Did the procedure for closing tickets change?

I do **not** see "resolve as..." in the Actions box on the bottom of a ticket webpage.

I am using `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110420 Gentoo Firefox/3.6.16` if that is relevant.
