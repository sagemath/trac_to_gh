Keywords: pari init_stack

Make the PARI stack allocation more robust. In particular, if doubling fails, try to increase the stack by a smaller amount. And check for overflow in `init_stack()`.

Also make the default PARI stack size a lot smaller (1MB instead of 16MB).

**Apply** [attachment:10018_pari_init_stack.patch]

This might be a bug with the handling of `allocatemem()` in PARI.  The same computation in `gp` gives:

Ok. I thought of just adding number 5 (`talker`?) here, mapping it to `ValueError`, which comes nearest (could also be `TypeError` (domain) or `RangeError` etc.).

I think it is good that now all errors thrown by PARI are of the type `PariError`.  If you want to raise a different exception, I think it should be done by higher-level code, like:

```
try:
    # do something with PARI
except PariError, err:
    if err.errnum() == talker:
        raise ValueError
    raise err
```

(this currently only works with Cython because `talker` is defined in a PARI C header).

The actual error message should be `vsnprintf()`'ed into a buffer (upstream) such that we can also propagate the real cause.

That is more or less the idea of #9640.

But I also noticed that the whole exception-catching mechanism can be vastly improved (for example, now there is a general signal-handling facility in Sage and a specific error-handling facility for PARI which should be merged into one system).  Also, there is essentially no testing code for this Cython error handling.  Good testing code should have caught #10018.  All this should eventually be in #9678.

I added the following in `src/language/init.c` to debug PARI:

```C
void
pari_err(int numerr, ...)
{
  PariOUT *out = pariOut;
  va_list ap;

  va_start(ap,numerr);

  if (numerr==talker) /* added part */
  {
    va_list ap2;
    const char *fmt;

    va_copy(ap2,ap);
    fmt=(char*)va_arg(ap2,char*);

    vfprintf(stderr,fmt,ap2); /* we can equally well write into a global buffer here */
    fflush(stderr);           /* with vsnprintf() to propagate the error message */

I actually added some more `printf()`s:

```C
    ...
    fprintf(stderr,
      "\n******************** PARI ERROR: ********************\n");
    vfprintf(stderr,fmt,ap2);
    fprintf(stderr,

    fflush(stderr);
    ...
```

Of course a temporary hack (and a bit odd in the interpreter), but an improvement to just

```
      File "gen.pyx", line 9460, in sage.libs.pari.gen._pari_trap (sage/libs/pari/gen.c:45047)
    PariError:  (5)
```
and trivial enough s.t. it could be merged without any risk. ;-)

(PARI's messages of course aren't always that informative without examining the stack.)
