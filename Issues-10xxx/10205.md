The following test from `sage/graphs/generic_graph_pyx.pyx` takes a very long time:

```
    TESTS:

    Running the algorithm on random instances, just to make sure the
    answers are still satisfiable path (the algorithm would raise an
    exception otherwise)::

        sage: for i in range(200):
        ...      g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.1)
        ...      _ = fh(G,find_path=True)
```
It looks like `g` should be `G`.  Making this change makes the runtime even larger.

At the very least, it should be marked `# long time` but even then I think it takes way too long.  Possibly some other tests in that file should also be marked `# long time`.

See #9698 where the algorithm was implemented, see also #10206 for more issues.

<a id='comment:5'></a>The test can take a very long time because it's possible that a randomly generated graph has a vertex of degree one. The warning in the documentation of `find_hamiltonian()` says that the function could loop endlessly when the input graph has a vertex of degree one. So something like the following is likely to loop endlessly.

```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: def long_test(n):

....:         _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
....:         
sage: long_test(1)
```

We need to avoid using graphs that have a vertex of degree one. Something like the following should reduce the runtime of the doctest.

```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: for i in range(100):  # long time
...       G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
...       while 1 in G.degree():
...           G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
...       _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
```

But even then, `graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)` could generate a graph with a vertex that has no out-neighbours. An exception similar to the following would then be returned (see #10206):

The attached patch makes sure that when choosing a random vertex, the chosen vertex must have at least one out-neighbour. It also reduces the runtime to a "reasonable" amount.




I came across a non-reproducible segfault with the following code:

```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: def long_test(n):
....:     for i in range(n):
....:         G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:         while 1 in G.degree():
....:             G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:         _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
....:         
sage: %time long_test(200)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
```
