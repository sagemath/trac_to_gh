Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

CC:  boothby @kcrisman @jhpalmieri @fchapoton

Keywords: usablity

Currently, to add or remove collaborators from a worksheet, one presses a button labelled "Invite Collaborators."

Since the same button is pressed when adding *or* removing, it should be labelled something like "Update Collaborator List."

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10586

To my mind, deprecated does not mean not supported. Ticket proposing new features for the notebook could be closed. But until the sage notebook is not officially supported anymore, it makes sense to keep these issue open. I know it is pointless but more politically correct.

Yes. github has an API for that

Whoops, I was perhaps politically incorrect last night when I closed a huge swath of notebook tickets assigned to me.  The last commit to github/sagenb was in december 2019, so it's apparently not quite dead.

More to the point, *no one* should be closing tickets related to anything without at least two people involved, one way or another.  Even for things like this.

Also, most of them do have "upstream" issues that I created some time ago - though as John says, how many people have time to work on fixing them is unclear.
