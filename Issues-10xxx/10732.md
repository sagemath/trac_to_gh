I agree that this would be better, however Sage can't yet deal with divisors containing non-rational points (see the TODO in the docstring of `Divisor_curve` in `sage/schemes/generic/divisor.py`).

How about a comment in the new code saying that we should use `irreducible_components()` as soon as non-rational points can be dealt with?  I'd rather not postpone fixing an existing issue while we wait for new functionality that could take a while to arrive.

That is a good idea.  Could you also delete the trailing whitespace in the first empty line after the function?  Then you can set it to positive review.
