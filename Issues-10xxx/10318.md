I'm a bit puzzled why the need for two patches. Is the combined patch one in which could be used instead of the patch on #8807? 

I have no problems giving the small patch a positive reivew. I guess its up to the release manager how best to handle this - whether #8807 is applied first, and then your simple patch, or just your combined patch. 

I would have thought the best way to handle this was to just have the simple patch, and make it conditional on #8807 being applied first.

That's right -- I made it conditional on the #8807 patch since that patch has the word in it, and it also makes a lot of changes to the file where most of the occurrences occur.

I'll put a cross-reference at #8807 saying that this ticket has a positive review and can/should be merged right after that one.
