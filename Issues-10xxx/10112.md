As noted at #10111 and 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6e8d6f28c915830d?hl=en

`random_prime()` is not well documented. 

But `random_prime()` is also broken for some erroneous input. Programs should always handle poor input properly, which is the case of Sage probably means generating an error message. 

```
sage: random_prime(0,True,-1) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(0,False,-1) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(1,0,-23) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(-12,0,-12) # Hangs
sage: random_prime(0, proof=False, lbound=-12) # Hangs
```

Having a negative lower bound can cause the function to hang, but this is not always the case, as the example below shows. Here an error message is generated. 

```
sage: random_prime(-12,0,-4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha3/<ipython console> in <module>()

/export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.6.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in random_prime(n, proof, lbound)
   1144     n = ZZ(n)
   1145     if n < lbound:
-> 1146         raise ValueError, "n must be greater than lbound: %s"%(lbound)
   1147     elif n == 2:
   1148         return ZZ(n)

ValueError: n must be greater than lbound: -4
```

Mike, 
thank you for fixing this. I'll try this later today, but here's a few comments from reading the patch only - I've not tested it in Sage yet. 

Should the example on line 1127 be

`random_prime(200, proof=False, lbound=100) ` ? 

Currently it's the same as the previous example. 

One thing that would be nice is if you did like John did at #10105 and have doctests for the commands that currently hang Sage. Then if there are any regressions, and the bug(s) get back in, this will be detected. 

Perhaps I'll get bored of running my little script that supplies junk to commands to see what ones crash sage (like #10113) or hang Sage like this ticket, #10108 and #10105.

The patch deals with the cases listed.  But there are other cases which hang, like

```
sage: random_prime(8, lbound=8)
```
and some that almost do, like

```
sage: random_prime(3, lbound=-10^8)
```
They can be very easily dealt with.  The additional patch does this.

Those two patches are a definite improvement, so I'm giving it a positive review.

I've opened #10277 for another issue with `random_prime`

Sage's implementation is also incredibly slow compared to Mathematica. After 20 minutes of CPU time on a 3.33 GHz machine I was unable to generate one up to 10<sup>1000</sup> with Sage. Yet Mathematica can do that in 7 seconds!

The issue raised in #10277 (which surely arises from using `random_prime` as patched here) shows the weakness of using `prime_pi`.  There is a much better way of checking that there are some primes in the range in question.  A replacement alternative patch will be posted very soon.

A replacement patch is attached.  It uses Betrand's postulate and refinements due to Nakura and Schoenfield.  Only when the ratio of the upper and lower bounds is quite close to one is the smallest prime in the interval computed.

Can we create a fast but unsafe function `random_prime_unsafe()` and make the `random_prime()` function exposed to the users call that?

ATM, the `random_prime()` function is used in speed critical code. See `sage/ext/multi_modular.pyx` for example. In this use case, the checks are unnecessary and they would cause a dramatic slow down. We should be able to bypass the checks when we know the input makes sense. I suggest separating the core of the function from the code that makes it idiot-proof, and using the core directly in places like `sage/ext/multi_modular.pyx`.

When this change is made, there should be a clear and loud warning in the release notes to notify people who rely on the current behavior of `random_prime()` to switch to this unsafe version in their personal codebase as well.

Unless there's universal agreement on this, I suggest the changes in documentation, are put on #10111. That ticket was supposed to address the deficiencies in the documentation.

The changes needed to the documentation appear to be
