The problem is that the ctime of newly-created files over NFS is wrong:

```
vbraun@iras:~> rm -f test && touch test && stat test 
  File: `test' 
  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 8192   regular empty 
file

Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1036/  vbraun)   Gid: ( 1024/    sage)

Modify: 2010-10-23 09:59:05.009964000 -0400 
Change: 2010-10-23 09:58:47.918997000 -0400 
```
There is a nfs bug related to nfs time stamps 
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6127 
which is likely the culprit here. That bug was fixed in 2.6.17 (iras runs 
2.6.16). 

A possible workaround would be to build sage in `/tmp`, which is a local disk and where file creation times are correct.

Thanks, Volker.  Sage 4.6.1.alpha0 indeed builds successfully under iras' small `/tmp` and the long doctests pass.
