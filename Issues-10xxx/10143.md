There are a few functions missing doctesting in sage/plot that aren't in plot3d/.  Fixing this is the subject of this ticket.  Doing it for plot.py largely is about GraphicsArray objects, so that is a separate ticket - #10144.

Humble pie - BOTH the first two were typos.  Sorry.  The new description is correct.

I see what is going on.  Useful for buildbot, but not at all useful for people manually applying patches who won't know how many iterations they have to go back!  Thanks for the clarification.
