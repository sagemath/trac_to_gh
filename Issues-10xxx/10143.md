There are a few functions missing doctesting in sage/plot that aren't in plot3d/.  Fixing this is the subject of this ticket.  Doing it for plot.py largely is about GraphicsArray objects, so that is a separate ticket - #10144.

The only rebase needed was in removing the `ensure_subs` function in misc.py.  The reviewer patch still applies after this.   There are no other changes, and I once again checked docs and tests, so I think positive review restoration is appropriate.
