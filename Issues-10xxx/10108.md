Following some very quick hacks at using "fuzz testing" techniques, I found that

```
sage: mwrank(-10)
```

just hangs, but does not appear to be using any CPU time. Although I don't know what this is supposed to do, from discussions on sage-devel, I understand my suspicions this behavior is an error were correct. 

Can someone please select the component appropriately, as I don't have a clue myself.

If this hard, then perhaps it's more effort to fix properly than it is worth. You are a better judge of that than me. 

I can't help feeling if this is supposed to take 5 integers then it should take 5, and not accept fewer or more, as it does. For example:

```
sage: mwrank('1 2 3')
"Curve [0,0,0,1,2] :     \n1 points of order 2:\n[-1:0:1]\n\nUsing 2-isogenous curve [0,6,0,-7,0] (minimal model [0,0,0,-19,30])\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFirst step, determining 1st descent Selmer groups\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAfter first local descent, rank bound = 0\nrk(S^{phi}(E'))=        1\nrk(S^{phi'}(E))=        1\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSecond step, determining 2nd descent Selmer groups\n-------------------------------------------------------\n...skipping since we already know rank=0\nAfter second local descent, rank bound = 0\nrk(phi'(S^{2}(E)))=     1\nrk(phi(S^{2}(E')))=     1\nrk(S^{2}(E))=   1\nrk(S^{2}(E'))=  2\n\nThird step, determining E(Q)/phi(E'(Q)) and E'(Q)/phi'(E(Q))\n-------------------------------------------------------\n1. E(Q)/phi(E'(Q))\n-------------------------------------------------------\n(c,d)  =(-3,4)\n(c',d')=(6,-7)\nThis component of the rank is 0\n-------------------------------------------------------\n2. E'(Q)/phi'(E(Q))\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis component of the rank is 0\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSummary of results:\n-------------------------------------------------------\n        rank(E) = 0\n        #E(Q)/2E(Q) = 2\n\nInformation on III(E/Q):\n        #III(E/Q)[phi']    = 1\n        #III(E/Q)[2]       = 1\n\nInformation on III(E'/Q):\n        #phi'(III(E/Q)[2]) = 1\n        #III(E'/Q)[phi]    = 1\n        #III(E'/Q)[2]      = 1\n\n\nUsed descent via 2-isogeny with isogenous curve E' = [0,0,0,-19,30]\nRank = 0\nRank of S^2(E)  = 1\nRank of S^2(E') = 2\nRank of S^phi(E') = 1\nRank of S^phi'(E) = 1\n\nSearching for points (bound = 8)...done:\n  found points of rank 0\n  and regulator 1\nProcessing points found during 2-descent...done:\n  now regulator = 1\nSaturating (bound = 100)...done:\n  points were already saturated.\n\n\nRegulator = 1\n\nThe rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined unconditionally.\n (0.055625 seconds)"
```

(It would also be nice if those `\n`'s actually created a new line, as I expect they are supposed to do, but that's another issue entirely.)

Again, I don't feel able to review the Python.

Very sorry - -first I thought it was the patch's name, then the comment in the doctest...  but at least the bugfix works!

What is strange is that simply doing

```
sage: mwrank([0,-1,1,0,0])
```
in a "real" Sage session works.  So it works in Sage, but not in a doctest.  I will need to investigate further.

The git commit does a better jpb than the old patch:  I implemented a new function `validate_mwrank_input` which accepts (and to a small degree standardises) valid mwrank inputs using some regular expression analysis.  This means that mwrank will only get sent a valid string.

This is now ready for review.

Ah interesting.

I did not change anything. I litterally took your mwrank.py and copied it into a branch based at develop, checking that this file was not touch on since then.

So I get the above errors and you do not get them. So it seems that mwrank does not give back the same string for you than for me. The issue (in both failures) is the final sentence. I get

"The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined unconditionally."

while we test for

"The rank has been determined unconditionally."

Is there a change in mwrank that I have missed?

commit e4f365ae32a8804072b839205566fede75066431

    Trac #10108: more robust interface to mwrank

commit 1bd331978c99681b70e4877fa3149b0c9adf47ce
Author: Volker Braun <vbraun.name@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jan 25 01:41:12 2014 +0000

    Updated Sage version to 6.1.rc0
```
so I rebuild (i.e. "make").  And sage/interfaces/mwrank.py passes its tests.  And specifically when in Sage I run

```
sage: mwrank('0 -1 1 0 0')
```
the output string is

```
'Curve [0,-1,1,0,0] :\tBasic pair: I=16, J=-304\ndisc=-76032\n2-adic index bound = 2\nBy Lemma 5.1(a), 2-adic index = 1\n2-adic index = 1\nOne (I,J) pair\nLooking for quartics with I = 16, J = -304\nLooking for Type 3 quartics:\nTrying positive a from 1 up to 1 (square a first...)\n(1,0,-4,4,0)\t--trivial\n(1,0,2,4,1)\t--trivial\nTrying positive a from 1 up to 1 (...then non-square a)\nFinished looking for Type 3 quartics.\nMordell rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nSelmer  rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nSha     rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nMordell rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\nSelmer  rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\nSha     rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\n\nUsed full 2-descent via multiplication-by-2 map\nRank = 0\nRank of S^2(E)  = 0\n\nProcessing points found during 2-descent...done:\n  now regulator = 1\n\n\nRegulator = 1\n\nThe rank has been determined unconditionally.\n\n (0.004001 seconds)'
```


Now I see what is happening!    The curve has rank 0;  so mwrank does not do the usual saturation step of making sure that we have the full MW group and not a subgroup of finite index;  there is a flag (in my C++ code) called sat_ok which is set to 1 if saturation suceeds, 0 if it fails -- and is uninitialized otherwise!  So it will be random for a rank 0 curve where one sees the additional string "The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined" or "The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined".

Obviously I will correct this in eclib, which is timely since I was planning tp update Sage's version sson anyway.  Meanwhile we'll have to sidestep this by changing that doctest sneakily.  I suggest first deleting the variable sentence, effectively moving the "..." forward; and in the next line just test for "Rank = 0" in s.

Shall I do that or will you?

The eclib patch is visible here:

https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commit/d1ab6a59103fb86730f1e668e70ecf010ee37b2d

and the new version (with a lot more than just this change) is in a new spkg at #15738.  But this ticket does not need that.
