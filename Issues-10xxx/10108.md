Following some very quick hacks at using "fuzz testing" techniques, I found that

```
sage: mwrank(-10)
```

just hangs, but does not appear to be using any CPU time. Although I don't know what this is supposed to do, from discussions on sage-devel, I understand my suspicions this behavior is an error were correct. 

Can someone please select the component appropriately, as I don't have a clue myself.

If this hard, then perhaps it's more effort to fix properly than it is worth. You are a better judge of that than me. 

I can't help feeling if this is supposed to take 5 integers then it should take 5, and not accept fewer or more, as it does. For example:

```
sage: mwrank('1 2 3')
"Curve [0,0,0,1,2] :     \n1 points of order 2:\n[-1:0:1]\n\nUsing 2-isogenous curve [0,6,0,-7,0] (minimal model [0,0,0,-19,30])\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFirst step, determining 1st descent Selmer groups\n-------------------------------------------------------\nAfter first local descent, rank bound = 0\nrk(S^{phi}(E'))=        1\nrk(S^{phi'}(E))=        1\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSecond step, determining 2nd descent Selmer groups\n-------------------------------------------------------\n...skipping since we already know rank=0\nAfter second local descent, rank bound = 0\nrk(phi'(S^{2}(E)))=     1\nrk(phi(S^{2}(E')))=     1\nrk(S^{2}(E))=   1\nrk(S^{2}(E'))=  2\n\nThird step, determining E(Q)/phi(E'(Q)) and E'(Q)/phi'(E(Q))\n-------------------------------------------------------\n1.

```

(It would also be nice if those `\n`'s actually created a new line, as I expect they are supposed to do, but that's another issue entirely.)

Again, I don't feel able to review the Python.

This patch gives trouble for me when merging it as part of a potential sage-4.6.1.alpha0.  For some reason I cannot explain, I get the following error when running `sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/mwrank.py`:

```

```

What is strange is that simply doing

```
sage: mwrank([0,-1,1,0,0])
```
in a "real" Sage session works.  So it works in Sage, but not in a doctest.  I will need to investigate further.

I think I can explain this.  The problem to be solved for this ticket was that if mwrank is given incomplete but otherwise correct input, it just waits for the rest of the input, making Sage appear to hang.  To fix this I made sure that the input provided by Sage always has some other stuff appended to it, so mwrank never has insufficient input.

Clearly what I did was insufficient, but this does explain who the order of executing commands does matter.

The git commit does a better jpb than the old patch:  I implemented a new function `validate_mwrank_input` which accepts (and to a small degree standardises) valid mwrank inputs using some regular expression analysis.  This means that mwrank will only get sent a valid string.

This is now ready for review.

Ah interesting.

I did not change anything. I litterally took your mwrank.py and copied it into a branch based at develop, checking that this file was not touch on since then.

So I get the above errors and you do not get them. So it seems that mwrank does not give back the same string for you than for me. The issue (in both failures) is the final sentence. I get

"The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined unconditionally."

while we test for

"The rank has been determined unconditionally."

Is there a change in mwrank that I have missed?

(I revert back to needs_work).

I think there was some conflict between the state of the original branch of mine called ticket/10108 and the branch I had after checking out yours.  So I switched back to develop, deleted the branch ticket/10108 altogether and re-pulled it.  Now my git log has the right look to it:

```
commit e4f365ae32a8804072b839205566fede75066431
Author: Chris Wuthrich <christian.wuthrich@gmail.com>

    Trac #10108: more robust interface to mwrank

commit 1bd331978c99681b70e4877fa3149b0c9adf47ce
Author: Volker Braun <vbraun.name@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jan 25 01:41:12 2014 +0000

    Updated Sage version to 6.1.rc0
```
so I rebuild (i.e. "make").  And sage/interfaces/mwrank.py passes its tests.  And specifically when in Sage I run

```
sage: mwrank('0 -1 1 0 0')
```
the output string is

```
'Curve [0,-1,1,0,0] :\tBasic pair: I=16, J=-304\ndisc=-76032\n2-adic index bound = 2\nBy Lemma 5.1(a), 2-adic index = 1\n2-adic index = 1\nOne (I,J) pair\nLooking for quartics with I = 16, J = -304\nLooking for Type 3 quartics:\nTrying positive a from 1 up to 1 (square a first...)\n(1,0,-4,4,0)\t--trivial\n(1,0,2,4,1)\t--trivial\nTrying positive a from 1 up to 1 (...then non-square a)\nFinished looking for Type 3 quartics.\nMordell rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nSelmer  rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nSha     rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0\nMordell rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\nSelmer  rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\nSha     rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0\n\nUsed full 2-descent via multiplication-by-2 map\nRank = 0\nRank of S^2(E)  = 0\n\nProcessing points found during 2-descent...done:\n  now regulator = 1\n\n\nRegulator = 1\n\nThe rank has been determined unconditionally.\n\n (0.004001 seconds)'
```


Now I see what is happening!    The curve has rank 0;  so mwrank does not do the usual saturation step of making sure that we have the full MW group and not a subgroup of finite index;  there is a flag (in my C++ code) called sat_ok which is set to 1 if saturation suceeds, 0 if it fails -- and is uninitialized otherwise!  So it will be random for a rank 0 curve where one sees the additional string "The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined" or "The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined".

Obviously I will correct this in eclib, which is timely since I was planning tp update Sage's version sson anyway.  Meanwhile we'll have to sidestep this by changing that doctest sneakily.  I suggest first deleting the variable sentence, effectively moving the "..." forward; and in the next line just test for "Rank = 0" in s.

Shall I do that or will you?

I can do it. 

Do you want to keep the lengthy output to be tested ? Or would not 
'Curve [0,-1,1,0,0] :\tBasic pair: I=16, J=-304 ... determined unconditionally ...'
be enough ?

That would be enough, certainly as we also check that "Rank = 0" is in there.

The eclib patch is visible here:

https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commit/d1ab6a59103fb86730f1e668e70ecf010ee37b2d

and the new version (with a lot more than just this change) is in a new spkg at #15738.  But this ticket does not need that.
