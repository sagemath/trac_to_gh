This ticket puzzles me. On my research group's Sage box (not as powerful as sage.math but less heavily loaded, thus faster in practice), `ModularSymbols(N).cuspidal_subspace().decomposition()` takes so long even for `N = 500` or so that it's somehow not even conceivable that it could finish in any reasonable time for `N = 4727`.

I'm tempted to suggest we close this as "worksforme" unless we can reproduce the failure; but I can't help wondering how this was initially spotted -- has there been some massive speed regression, so the computation was feasible in Sage as of 7 months back?

In an ideal world, we'd have a library of working builds of old Sage versions somewhere and we could try to pinpoint what changed to fix the bug; but since the bug was only ever occurring sporadically, that would be very laborious to do. 

I nominate this ticket to be closed.
