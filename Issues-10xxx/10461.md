Review:  patch applies fine to 4.6.1.alpha3, and tests in sage.combinat.partition pass.

After the patch:

```
sage/combinat/partition.py
SCORE sage/combinat/partition.py: 100% (155 of 155)

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * from_exp(exp):
	 * from_core_and_quotient(core, quotient):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * partition_sign(pi):
```
The latter can be fixed by inserting the tag # indirect doctest on the relevant lines.

In addition:  The new docstrings do not conform to Sage's standards perfectly.  Each function should have a one line description, then INPUT and OUTPUT blocks to describe the input parameters (if any;  ignore self) and output.  And apply suitable markup to mathematical symbols: a few are missing.

The reference manual rebuilds fine, no warnings.

Hence: needs work (but only trivial work).

Feel free to return the compliment at #9228!

Ok, thanks, I will correct those!

Ok for the mathematical markup.

About the INPUT and OUTPUT blocks, do I have to put them for every function? I didn't know that. By the way, it seems that in #9228, the docstring you added do not contain those INPUT/OUTPUT blocks? Is it because I don't understand you or because we have to put them only in some cases?

Take a look at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings for the coding conventions.  Also, look at some other source files, and compare with how the output looks by checking the relevant pages of the online reference manual.

The INPUT block is most important (but do not list "self").   People often omit the OUTPUT block especially when it is obvious from the one-line description, or of course when there is no output.

As for #9228... well, I may not have done a perfect job!  If so, please point this out in your review!
