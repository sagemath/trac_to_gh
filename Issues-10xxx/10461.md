Since one of the goal of sage-5.0 is to raise doctest coverage to 90%, I take this opportunity to document a module I'm less familiar with.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Review:  patch applies fine to 4.6.1.alpha3, and tests in sage.combinat.partition pass.

After the patch:

```
sage/combinat/partition.py
SCORE sage/combinat/partition.py: 100% (155 of 155)

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * from_exp(exp):
	 * from_core_and_quotient(core, quotient):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * partition_sign(pi):
```
The latter can be fixed by inserting the tag # indirect doctest on the relevant lines.

In addition:  The new docstrings do not conform to Sage's standards perfectly.  Each function should have a one line description, then INPUT and OUTPUT blocks to describe the input parameters (if any;  ignore self) and output.  And apply suitable markup to mathematical symbols: a few are missing.

The reference manual rebuilds fine, no warnings.

Hence: needs work (but only trivial work).

Feel free to return the compliment at #9228!

Ok, thanks, I will correct those!

Ok for the mathematical markup.

About the INPUT and OUTPUT blocks, do I have to put them for every function? I didn't know that. By the way, it seems that in #9228, the docstring you added do not contain those INPUT/OUTPUT blocks? Is it because I don't understand you or because we have to put them only in some cases?

As for #9228... well, I may not have done a perfect job!  If so, please point this out in your review!
