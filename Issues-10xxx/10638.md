It turns out that 

```
sage: w = vector([x^2,3,x^3])
sage: plot(w,(x,0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError     
```
I guess this makes sense, since it is parametric.  But this seems reasonable to implement.

 I guess this makes sense, since it is parametric.  But this seems reasonable to implement.  
 
-Far worse is 
-
-```
-    from sage.structure.element import is_Vector
-    if kwds.get('parametric',False) and is_Vector(funcs):
-        funcs = tuple(funcs)
-
-
-    if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
-        G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
-    # if we are using the generic plotting method
-    else:
-```
-Which means that plotting a numeric vector apparently doesn't go through its custom `.plot()` method.  ???
-
-Anyway, we should figure out how to change this so that the vector plotting in 2 and 3 D is uniform in style.
