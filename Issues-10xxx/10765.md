Header of `sage/matrix/misc.py` says:

```
NOTE: The whole problem of avoiding circular imports -- the reason for
existence of this file -- is now a non-issue, since some bugs in
Cython were fixed.  Probably all this code should be moved into the
relevant classes and this file deleted.
```

So I did.  After a suitable deprecation period, the file can be obliterated.  Here's the overview:

Functions leaving `sage/matrix/misc.py`.  Originals have all been deprecated.

* `cmp_pivots`

  Existing duplicate already existed in `matrix/matrix2.pyx`.

* `hadamard_row_bound_mpfr`

  Moved to `matrix/matrix2.pyx` near where it was called, right by another similar helper function.  Converted to an underscore method, therefore.  Already has protection on base ring of the matrix (RR).

* `matrix_integer_sparse_rational_reconstruction`

  Moved into content of `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse.rational_reconstruction` which was just a one-line stub calling the function from `sage/matrix/misc.pyx`.

* `matrix_integer_dense_rational_reconstruction`

  Moved into content of `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.rational_reconstruction` which was just a one-line stub calling the function from `sage/matrix/misc.pyx`.  Adjusted a call in `matrix_cyclo_dense` to call this new method.

* `matrix_rational_echelon_form_multimodular`

  "Works" for sparse and dense matrices (see MAX_MODULUS) so added this to matrix2.pyx class as `sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix._echelon_form_multimodular_rational`.  Added protection to ensure base ring is rationals.

Almost all code changes are just to fit into new locations.  A bit of documentation clean-up where needed.

This passes all tests, but should be reviewed by somebody with significant Cython and/or `sage/matrix` experience.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
**Attachment:** [trac_10765-matrix-misc-routines.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10765/trac_10765-matrix-misc-routines.patch.gz)

Two questions for veterans of the matrix code:

1.  Should the new `_echelon_form_multimodular_rational` in `matrix2.py` be an underscore method (which is what was done)?

2.  Header of `misc.py` still has a stanza about `mod_int` and `MOD_INT_OVERFLOW`.  I'm guessing it should follow the multimodular echelon form into the top of `matrix2.pyx` but am not certain.  Advice?

This will not apply on 4.7.alpha1, and will rot further after #10752 goes in, so I'm going to orphan it for now.
