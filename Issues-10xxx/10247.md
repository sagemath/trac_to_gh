1) Please try the new PARI spkg from #10114: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) (I doubt this will solve the problem, but it's better to try the latest version anyway)

2) Try compiling PARI outside of Sage, i.e. download [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) and then:

```
$ tar xjf pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg
$ cd pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0/src
$ ./Configure
$ make gp
```

3) It would be good to see the full log file (spkg/logs/pari*.log).

4) The functions which fail are all inline functions, so it seems that inline functions are not exported somehow (they should be).

The problem is that PARI/GP compiles fine but the Sage library files depending on PARI do not.

Try adding `#define INLINE inline` there and try again (in any case, it would be useful if you would post the contents of that file).

problem. Could you show us the bit of log when libcsage is linked? It may seem
a bit far fetched but I think libcsage is linked in the wrong order.

No earlier, when you link libcsage, on linux it looks like this:

```

```
My own thinking is that on platform, or compiler, where ordering is important pari
should be before gmp. 
However thinking again, I don't know why compilation would break where it does for you and not when you build libcsage.

I'm pretty sure the fix is to change

`cdef extern:`

```

which gcc didn't like in Cygwin.
