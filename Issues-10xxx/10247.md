2) Try compiling PARI outside of Sage, i.e. download [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) and then:

```

3) It would be good to see the full log file (spkg/logs/pari*.log).

4) The functions which fail are all inline functions, so it seems that inline functions are not exported somehow (they should be).

My own thinking is that on platform, or compiler, where ordering is important pari

However thinking again, I don't know why compilation would break where it does for you and not when you build libcsage.
