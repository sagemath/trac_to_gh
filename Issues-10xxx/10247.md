1) Please try the new PARI spkg from #10114: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) (I doubt this will solve the problem, but it's better to try the latest version anyway)

2) Try compiling PARI outside of Sage, i.e. download [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) and then:

```
$ tar xjf pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg
$ cd pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0/src
$ ./Configure
$ make gp
```

3) It would be good to see the full log file (spkg/logs/pari*.log).

4) The functions which fail are all inline functions, so it seems that inline functions are not exported somehow (they should be).

No earlier, when you link libcsage, on linux it looks like this:

```
g++ -o libcsage.so -shared src/convert.os src/interrupt

```
My own thinking is that on platform, or compiler, where ordering is important pari
should be before gmp. 
However thinking again, I don't know why compilation would break where it does for you and not when you build libcsage.

I'm pretty sure the fix is to change
