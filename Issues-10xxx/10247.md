2) Try compiling PARI outside of Sage, i.e. download [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg) and then:

```
$ tar xjf pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0.spkg
$ cd pari-2.4.3.alpha.p0/src
$ ./Configure
$ make gp
```

3) It would be good to see the full log file (spkg/logs/pari*.log).

4) The functions which fail are all inline functions, so it seems that inline functions are not exported somehow (they should be).

The problem is that PARI/GP compiles fine but the Sage library files depending on PARI do not.

Sorry, ignore the last post.  Since the problem is not with PARI itself, but with the sagelib modules, instead do the following: after the PARI spkg is installed, find the file `SAGE_ROOT/local/include/pari/paricfg.h`.

Try adding `#define INLINE inline` there and try again (in any case, it would be useful if you would post the contents of that file).

No earlier, when you link libcsage, on linux it looks like this:

```
g++ -o libcsage.so -shared src/convert.os src/interrupt
.os src/mpn_pylong.os src/mpz_pylong.os src/mpz_longlong.os src/stdsage.os src/gmp_globals.os src/ZZ_py
long.os src/ntl_wrap.os -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/python/config -lntl -lgmp -lpari -lpython2.6
```
My own thinking is that on platform, or compiler, where ordering is important pari
should be before gmp. 
However thinking again, I don't know why compilation would break where it does for you and not when you build libcsage.
