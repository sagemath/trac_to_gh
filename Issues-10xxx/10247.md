3) It would be good to see the full log file (spkg/logs/pari*.log).

4) The functions which fail are all inline functions, so it seems that inline functions are not exported somehow (they should be).

2) Compiling inside Sage works fine.  I can use the gp shell just fine.  (Same goes for outside of Sage).

Sorry, ignore the last post.  Since the problem is not with PARI itself, but with the sagelib modules, instead do the following: after the PARI spkg is installed, find the file `SAGE_ROOT/local/include/pari/paricfg.h`.

Try adding `#define INLINE inline` there and try again (in any case, it would be useful if you would post the contents of that file).

problem. Could you show us the bit of log when libcsage is linked? It may seem
a bit far fetched but I think libcsage is linked in the wrong order.

No earlier, when you link libcsage, on linux it looks like this:

```
g++ -o libcsage.so -shared src/convert.os src/interrupt
.os src/mpn_pylong.os src/mpz_pylong.os src/mpz_longlong.os src/stdsage.os src/gmp_globals.os src/ZZ_py
long.os src/ntl_wrap.os -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/python/config -lntl -lgmp -lpari -lpython2.6
```
My own thinking is that on platform, or compiler, where ordering is important pari
should be before gmp. 
However thinking again, I don't know why compilation would break where it does for you and not when you build libcsage.
