I think it's the same bug like mentioned [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9385#comment:40) (link contains a workaround, but no solution yet).

Distribution: Fedora 13 (i686)

System: EeePC 1000H / Intel Atom N270

Compiler: gcc-4.4.4-10.fc13

Ram: 1GB (completely used during the compilation of ATLAS)

Swap: 2GB (nearly unused)

* http://www.tux21b.org/public/eeepc-sage-cpuinfo.txt

Grep for `"STAGE 2-1-2: CacheEdge DETECTION"`, `"make[3]: *** [build] Error 255"` or `"Too many failures to build ATLAS.  Giving up!"`

Note: After the "too many failures..." message, I've set `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` manually, so the remaining `install.log` isn't related to that build anymore (but incomplete, because the current build is still running). I'm sorry for that.

Please do not hesitate to ask for more information. If you want, I can also test everything you tell me, since this bug only seems to show up on certain systems.

A failure of ATLAS to build has been seen by a number of people, on different systems. We need to keep an eye on this.

I've decided to update to Sage 4.6 lately and so I compiled everything again (I was using 4.5.3 before).

My workaround based on setting the `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` env variable manually to skip the compilation of ATLAS wasn't working anymore (I think sage was expecting static libraries, but my distribution only provided shared ones). So I decided to give ATLAS a try again - and tada: everything compiled perfectly!

I am still using the same system, the same configuration and I've tried to compile ATLAS in Sage 4.5.3 several times before (including compiling on a freshly rebooted system), so I am quite sure that something was changed in Sage 4.6 which solves my problem.

Many thanks for that!

Regards,

Christoph

The changelog in SPKG.txt for ATLAS tells you what has changed. 

```
== ChangeLog ==

== atlas-3.8.3.p16 (John Palmieri, September 19th 2010) ==
 * Make spkg-check work when using SAGE_ATLAS_LIB: if SAGE_ATLAS_LIB
   is set, skip the self-tests.

== atlas-3.8.3.p15 (David Kirkby, September 6th 2010) ==
 * Make SAGE_ATLAS_LIB use static libraries on all platforms, 
   as building two shared libraries often fails on Linux, and 
   messes things up on Solaris. The static library is less hassle
   all around. Worth noting is that the ATLAS package only builds
   the static library and Wolfram Research only ship the static 
   library with Mathematica, despite they usually use shared
   libraries. To ensure full compatibility with a fresh build
   of ATLAS, the symbolic links are created for the shared libraries too.
   The links will fail to be created if the shared libraries do not exist, 
   but will not cause any extra problems. 
 * Update the list of dependencies to include Python and Lapack (see
   spkg/deps)
 * Note that the ATLAS build process could be made much quicker if its 
   depenancy on Python was removed. Since the amount of Python code is 
   very small compared to the bash code, this seems logical to do at 
   a later date. The Fortran package would need the same change - but again
   the amount of Python in that is trivial. 
 * Add a note that make-correct-shared.sh is badly named, as it often fails. 
 * Remove the OS X specific code from make-correct-shared.sh, as ATLAS is 
   never installed on OS X - see the spkg-install-script.

== atlas-3.8.3.p14 (David Kirkby, August 10th 2010) ==
```

atlas-3.8.3.p15 should link both the shared and static libraries. If it is not, then we have a bug. 


If you do not use SAGE_ATLAS_LIB, I cant think of anything that should have changed. that would have affected your CacheEdge DETECTION problem. I think its just more luck than anything else. 

This probably depends on system load. The actual building of ATLAS has remiained unchanged for ages - only the libraries have been altered, but the CacheEdge DETECTION fails well before any library issues are touched. 

Only the release manager should generally close tickets, though those with admin priviledge do so occasionally when it is very clear an issue needs closing. In this case, you should not have closed it. 

This issues does not tend to be totally reproducible, and I think there is a real problem here.

Hi

I get this on Ubuntu 11.04, 32 bit OS install, Compaq laptop, Intel P6200 2.13Ghz CPU (64bit capable), 2G RAM (about 1.9G visible), initially with throttling, then without, now with a 512M swap file added.

Note it once made it past 2-1-2 to 2-3-2.
jan@mamana-PC:~$ grep CacheEdge /usr/local/src/sage-4.7.1/spkg/logs/atlas-3.8.3.p16.log

atlas-3.8.4.spkg inserted into sage-4.7.1 failed pretty quickly:

It looks like the prebuilt sage-4.7-linux-32bit-ubuntu_10.04_lts-i686-Linux is running OK.

I will have periodic access to this laptop to run more tests if requested.

Assuming this is fixed, for example by #10508.
