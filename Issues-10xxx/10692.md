<a id='comment:1'></a>Hi Christian!

Thanks for this useful feature!

A couple suggestions:

- Thanks for being careful with potential conflicts with #6588 (so far so good :-))
- I would prefer to call the method as
  RootSystem(["A",3]).root_lattice().root_poset() (possibly with a shortcut from root system, to possibly let the user choose in which realization the roots are returned
- The code could be written generically for any RootLatticeRealization by computing scalar products with coweights.
- Even without using scalar products, there should be no need to use dict's. Better use instead something like:

```
   for (i,c) in alpha:
       if beta[i] < c: ...
```

- The root comparison function could be extracted as a separate method, as it could be of more general use

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

I only moved the method to the root lattice realization for now.

>  - The code could be written generically for any RootLatticeRealization by computing scalar products with coweights.


this is still not done.

>  - Even without using scalar products, there should be no need to use dict's.


done.

>  - The root comparison function could be extracted as a separate method, as it could be of more general use


done, maybe there should be a better name, and it might be good to exclude negative roots.

How do I actually check if a patch contains any warnings or errors? When I build it, I don't see anything wrong looking at the (html) output.

I used '\text' to have this statement written in latex text style rather than in the usual text style. I found this output emphasising the statement better.

Best, Christian
