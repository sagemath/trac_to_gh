Hi Christian!

Thanks for this useful feature!

A couple suggestions:

- Thanks for being careful with potential conflicts with #6588 (so far so good :-))
- I would prefer to call the method as
  RootSystem(["A",3]).root_lattice().root_poset() (possibly with a shortcut from root system, to possibly let the user choose in which realization the roots are returned
- The code could be written generically for any RootLatticeRealization by computing scalar products with coweights.
- Even without using scalar products, there should be no need to use dict's. Better use instead something like:

```
   for (i,c) in alpha:
       if beta[i] < c: ...
```

- The root comparison function could be extracted as a separate method, as it could be of more general use

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

I only moved the method to the root lattice realization for now.

>  - The code could be written generically for any RootLatticeRealization by computing scalar products with coweights.


this is still not done.

>  - Even without using scalar products, there should be no need to use dict's.


done.

>  - The root comparison function could be extracted as a separate method, as it could be of more general use


done, maybe there should be a better name, and it might be good to exclude negative roots.

I have read the patch, I have two comments.

1) Maybe the doc could make use of Sphinx markup, to replace alpha and beta by true greek letters.

2) Maybe one could also implement the poset of positive-but-not-simple-roots (under what name, I do not know) ? This is another very useful poset, at least for me.

How do I actually check if a patch contains any warnings or errors? When I build it, I don't see anything wrong looking at the (html) output.

I used '\text' to have this statement written in latex text style rather than in the usual text style. I found this output emphasising the statement better.

Best, Christian
