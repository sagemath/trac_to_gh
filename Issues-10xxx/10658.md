This ticket is to introduce a new feature for computing with modular forms in Sage: the explicit computation of the local component of the automorphic representation attached to a newform.

This is based on the algorithms developed by Jared Weinstein and myself. Magma also has this, but this code is an independent implementation and covers some cases the Magma code doesn't (e.g. the Magma code can't distinguish between a newform and its quadratic twist in certain cases).

<a id='comment:5'></a>The review patch contains some doctest that I made fail on purpose; They are (minor) TODOs that, if completed, I would say are sufficient for giving the patch a positive review.

I needed to move the definition of smooth characters (elements) to the top of the file, but the code itself is mainly untouched.
