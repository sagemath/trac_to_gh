Sage likes rows better than columns.  This constructor follows suit, but then takes a transpose.  So if input entries are given as a list of lists, or a list of vectors, the inner lists get turned into columns when it is finished.

Inputs are just like for the `matrix()` constructor, except dimensions effectively get swapped around.  When giving just one dimension, it will be the number of columns, which is perhaps as it should be.

Thanks, Dan.  (That was fast.)

I built this against a clean 4.6.1.alpha3 so I wonder too why it won't apply.  I was going to add the right comments for the patchbot to find it, but my understanding was that with just one patch, that's what would get used.  Hmmm.
