For ` N(1+10**-400000,digits=400001)` the displayed number of digits is only 400000, it is printing 1. followed by 399999 zeroes. The reason is that in functional.py: ` prec = int((digits+1) * 3.32192) + 1`. However `log(10)/log(2)~3.3219280948874>3.32192`, so if digits is large the used precision will be smaller by some digits than the requested number of digits.

The suggestion is to use 3.32193 instead of 3.32192, see the trivial patch.

Okay, so I've changed all six instances of "3.32192" (which seems to be the most common approximation to log(10,2) in use).  There are three  other references matching 3.32* (in rings/arith.py, interfaces/gp.py, and libs/pari/gen.pyx) I left alone.  Those all have at least 10 digits, so the problem would be pushed to higher levels even if it occurs, and there was in every case something I wasn't confident enough of to change.  I don't know much about how pari's precision works, for example.

I think it's a step in the right direction, anyhow.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Why not get exactly the correct number of digits? Certainly the added precision will fix the problem for much larger numbers.

The question is how many digits we can feasibly expect people to want to calculate. 3.32193 works for 1000000 digits, 3.3219281 works for 10000000, but I don't see why we can't use 3.3219280948873627 to future-proof it.

To calculate the precision error with different approximations of log(10, 2):

(floor((n + 1) * a) + 1) - (floor((n + 1) * log(10,2).n(100000)) + 1),

where n is the number of digits you want, and a is the approximation. log(10,2).n(100000) is just used for comparison.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I simply followed the OP's suggestion, which works just fine: adding more digits would only change things by ~1e-7 or so.

"Why not get exactly the correct number of digits?"

Well, since I don't know if the last digits are guaranteed to be correct anyway, I'm not sure how important it is to be precise when we're not accurate, esp. given that we don't seem to have been in the past.  Of the two, not using as much precision as requested is a far more serious problem than using a (very tiny) bit more.  But it's probably easier for us simply to change it than to waste time arguing about the use case. :-)

As for: "3.32193 works for 1000000 digits, 3.3219281 works for 10000000, but I don't see why we can't use 3.3219280948873627 to future-proof it."

I think there's some confusion here.  3.32193 works for _any_ number of digits, because it's an over-estimate.  It's already completely future-proofed.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I see your point. I guess the way to do it would be to use the overestimate and slice to the correct number of digits, but this may be difficult since there doesn't seem to be an index method for RealNumber.
