For ` N(1+10**-400000,digits=400001)` the displayed number of digits is only 400000, it is printing 1. followed by 399999 zeroes. The reason is that in functional.py: ` prec = int((digits+1) * 3.32192) + 1`. However `log(10)/log(2)~3.3219280948874>3.32192`, so if digits is large the used precision will be smaller by some digits than the requested number of digits.

The suggestion is to use 3.32193 instead of 3.32192, see the trivial patch.

Okay, so I've changed all six instances of "3.32192" (which seems to be the most common approximation to log(10,2) in use).  There are three  other references matching 3.32* (in rings/arith.py, interfaces/gp.py, and libs/pari/gen.pyx) I left alone.  Those all have at least 10 digits, so the problem would be pushed to higher levels even if it occurs, and there was in every case something I wasn't confident enough of to change.  I don't know much about how pari's precision works, for example.

I think it's a step in the right direction, anyhow.

Very clever testing.  

Very minor 'needs work' issues:
* I think you could also add as a doctest the example at #12163 (a dup, more or less).  We do like doctesting problems people officially put on tickets.  That sort of example has the added benefit of being a little easier to read :) Of course, if more than one person disagrees, it's not a big deal.

```
Make sure we've rounded up log(10,2) enough to guarantee sufficient precision (trac #10164).
```
   Try to shorten those puppies up to the 80-character limit (if I recall correctly) for fine terminal viewing.

Because this has the potential to do weird things to doctests, I'm not going to give positive review in any case until I run long tests.  But looks good other than those tiny issues.

Also, a question: I assume it's okay (and already the case, in fact) that we have MORE digits than "officially requested" by the user.

Why not get exactly the correct number of digits? Certainly the added precision will fix the problem for much larger numbers.

The question is how many digits we can feasibly expect people to want to calculate. 3.32193 works for 1000000 digits, 3.3219281 works for 10000000, but I don't see why we can't use 3.3219280948873627 to future-proof it.

To calculate the precision error with different approximations of log(10, 2):

(floor((n + 1) * a) + 1) - (floor((n + 1) * log(10,2).n(100000)) + 1),

where n is the number of digits you want, and a is the approximation. log(10,2).n(100000) is just used for comparison.

I simply followed the OP's suggestion, which works just fine: adding more digits would only change things by ~1e-7 or so.

"Why not get exactly the correct number of digits?"

Well, since I don't know if the last digits are guaranteed to be correct anyway, I'm not sure how important it is to be precise when we're not accurate, esp. given that we don't seem to have been in the past.  Of the two, not using as much precision as requested is a far more serious problem than using a (very tiny) bit more.  But it's probably easier for us simply to change it than to waste time arguing about the use case. :-)

As for: "3.32193 works for 1000000 digits, 3.3219281 works for 10000000, but I don't see why we can't use 3.3219280948873627 to future-proof it."

I think there's some confusion here.  3.32193 works for _any_ number of digits, because it's an over-estimate.  It's already completely future-proofed.
