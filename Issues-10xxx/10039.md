The Parma Polyhedra Library (ppl) is for many workloads the fastest library for polyhedral computations. It is also high-quality code, for example GCC uses it (optionally) to optimize loops. 
* ppl has already been widely tested on a multitude of platforms.
* Native C++ with a pure C interface.
* Contains a huge testsuite `_and_` passes its own testsuite (in contrast to some other polydedral library that shall remain unnamed)

Official webpage: http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/

My plan is to 
1. Create a PPL spkg.
2. Write a Cython interface. 
3. Base `sage.geometry.cone.Cone` on PPL instead of `Polyhedron/cddlib`
4. Split `sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron` into an abstract base class and derived classes that use different polyhedral computation libraries.

Current status:
1. My cython wrapper for PPL is attached. It has full doctest coverage and any invalid input is caught and raises `ValueError`.
2. Is split off into trac #10140.

For convenience I mirrored the reference manual page here: http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/html/en/reference/sage/libs/ppl.html

If there will be a Cython interface to PPL, it definitely should become the default backend as it must be drastically faster on simple cases then the current situation. And for "complicated" cases users should be willing to spend some time to learn about advantages of different systems and pick the right one, if speed becomes an issue.

I read the module documentation and it looks quite nice, although the PPL interface and their documentation do not seem to be very clear to an unfamiliar user (as Marshall has already noted above). So if eventually Sage front-end is structured more like current geometric classes, it would be better - I guess that's exactly your plan in 4.

Can PPL compute integral points inside a bounded polytope?

Just to be clear, the PPL wrapper is not going to be exposed to the end user by default. She/he is supposed to use the higher-level `Polyhedron` and `Cone` classes.

The PPL sports grids (lattices defined through generators or congruences) and a MIP solver but, as far as I know, no function that directly enumerates grid points (i.e. the intersection of a grid with a polyhedron). Though it probably would not be too difficult to write one with these building blocks. In any case, I haven't cython-wrapped grids or MIPs so far.

That sure is a long time. I think it's because autoconf scripts takes ages on Cygwin, because Windows has no fork.

On my Sun Ultra 27, it takes less than 82 seconds to install. 

```

Making script relocatable
Finished installing ppl-0.11.p0.spkg
```

However, it fails the test suite. To be more precise, the tests it runs pass, but it fails to build some of the code needed for the tests. 

I'm not sure what the gcc option `-W` is supposed to do. According to the gcc manual `-w` (lower case) is to suppress all warnings. If `-W` does the same as `-w`, then it seems the code tries to supporess the warnings, then enable them, which seems a bit illogical. But I can't find out exactly what `-W` is supposed to do. 

BTW, this should be called ppl-0.11 and not ppl-0.11.p0. Only once a version has appeared in Sage, and patches have been applied, should it be called .p0. 

A couple more points. 
* There is no code to handle 64-bit builds on platforms where SAGE64=yes. It needs something like this:

```
    if [ "x$CFLAG64" = x ]; then 
        CFLAG64=-m64
    fi

    # If the environment variable SAGE64=yes, force building a 64-bit version:
    if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
        echo "Building a 64-bit version of ppl"
        CC="$CC $CFLAG64"
        export CC
    fi
```

That needs to be in both spkg-install and spkg-check. 

* I don't think *Unpack distribution into src/ directory* needs to be in the `Special Update/Build Instructions` section, as that is the same with every single package. 
 
* I would start `spkg-check` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to be consistent. That said, there's nothing there which should not work with any half-reasonable shell. 

* It would be better to use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check` so the tests can be run in parallel too, which should speed things up a lot.

I fixed the documentation according to your suggestions.

> 4. Why `affine_dimension` of the empty polyhedron is 0? Shouldn't it be -1 to distinguish it from points?

The internal representation of dimensions is an unsigned int. So PPL returns 0 instead of something negative. Using signed integer would half the `max_space_dimension()` ;-)

> 5. Am I right that "concatenating" polyhedra means taking their Cartesian product? Perhaps, it is a simpler explanation than in `concatenate_assign`?

Yes. I just copy/pasted the C++ documentation. I've added a line that this is the Cartesian product.

>    7. I don't understand what exactly is done by `drop_some_non_integer_points`.

All that is guaranteed is that the result is non-strictly contained in the original polyhedron and that integral vertices survive. Its not the most useful function, but it is there and was easy to wrap ;-)

> 8. `frequency` does not have documentation.

I removed this one, it is only useful for grids (spanned lattices / congruences).

> 9. Is it necessary to have `hash_code`, especially if it only returns the dimension? My concern is that it can be confusing how it is related to standard `hash` in Python, also it seems strange to use it for mutable objects (again, because that's not how things work in Python).

Removed.

> 10. I got upset when I read in the documentation of `max_space_dimension` that it is bounded, but the doctest immediately made me happy ;-)

Yes, should be enough for most applications ;)

> 11. `clear_mpz_globals`, `gmp_randrange`, `init_mpz_globals` have no documentation.

I didn't define these, they were imported from `gmp.pxi` and sphinx adds them to the documentation for some reason. Anyways, importing `gmp.pxi` is not necessary so I removed it.

I think there are a few more things to do for it to be standard sage material.
In module_list.py you may want to do a bit more:

```
Extension('sage.libs.ppl', 
 	  sources = ['sage/libs/ppl.pyx', 'sage/libs/ppl_shim.cc'],
 	  libraries = ['ppl', 'gmpxx', 'gmp', 'm'], 
 	  language="c++",
          depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + "/include/ppl.hh"]),
```
In your wrapper sage/libs/ppl.pyx,  ../../local/include/ppl.hh should be simplified
to ppl.hh, same for everything else that has ../../local/include, setup.py knows to
include this folder. You only needs to add things if it is in a sub-folder and then 
you do that by adding an include line in module_list.py.

I think you should get William's approval too. I very much doubt it should be standard without being optional first. There's a ticket open to clarify that, but I can't be bothered to look for it now. 

Basically, getting a few people to agree to make it standard is not enough.

The bar should be high for standard packages, but not unreasonably so.  Don't make it difficult just so its difficult.

Most packages should be optional before being standard.  But if a lot of functionality is tied to them being present, as is the case here, then that doesn't always make sense.

Cddlib would never make it as a standard package now.  This is a big step towards being able to remove cddlib.

While William certainly has veto power, he did read that thread and did not object.  At this point I think that after someone gives this a positive review, its up to the release manager at the time to make the call.

I renamed the include `../../local/include/ppl.hh` to `ppl.hh`. Note that the `ppl.pyx` now really depends on #10233, because the current `setup.py` does **not** know how to include `*.hh` headers.

I also added the explicit dependency on `SAGE_LOCAL+/include/ppl.hh`.

Last, I just want to point out that now is the time to add PPL. I've fixed all outstanding bugs in `Polyhedron` that can be fixed within the current framework, and to continue improving it we need PPL.

glpk is not a dependency you gave to ppl so some sage install may end up with ppl_lpsol while others won't, depending on build order. I suggest that either glpk is added to the dependencies of ppl or that --disable-ppl_lpsol is passed to configure.

<div id="comment:36" align="right">comment:36</div>

This looks very good.

One doctest problem is that on 32-bit machines we get:

```
File "/Users/mh/sagestuff/sage-4.6.1.rc1/devel/sage-t1/sage/libs/ppl.pyx", line 2299:
    sage: C_Polyhedron(1, 'empty').max_space_dimension()
Expected:
    1152921504606846973
Got:
    357913939
```

so maybe that should be something like

```
sage: max_dim = C_Polyhedron(1, 'empty').max_space_dimension()
sage: max_dim in [357913939,1152921504606846973]
sage: True
```

or just 

```
sage: max_dim = C_Polyhedron(1, 'empty').max_space_dimension()
sage: max_dim > 1
sage: True
```

Francois, I fixed the 32 bit issue in `max_space_dimension()` a while ago, so you have an old version of the patch.

About the other errors, is this on Gentoo with your own PPL library? I suggest you use the Sage spkg since there are certain configuration options that I rely on.

ppl is 0.11, same as yours unless you patched it. We don't.
For all intent and purpose I am the co-maintainer of sage-on-gentoo by the way.
You just asked me to open a bug with myself :)
Yes this is not with your ppl spkg, I will have to create a set up to compare
results with vanilla sage and see what's different on x86. But just to make my point,
we leave enable-fpmath and enable-coefficients to their defaults which happens to be 
what you choose (unless you can point to something subbtle somewhere else), from
configure.ac:

```
enableval=default
fpmath_may_use_387=yes
fpmath_may_use_sse=yes
AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether to select specific floating point arithmetics])
AC_ARG_ENABLE(fpmath,
  AS_HELP_STRING([--enable-fpmath=INSTRUCTION_SET],
                 [select floating point arithmetics]))
case "${enableval}" in
sse)
  AC_MSG_RESULT(sse)
  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -msse -mfpmath=sse"
  # The SSE instruction set only supports single precision arithmetics:
  # double and extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.
  ;;
sse2)
  AC_MSG_RESULT(sse2)
  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -msse2 -mfpmath=sse"
  # SSE2 still does not support extended precision arithmetics.
  ;;
387)
  AC_MSG_RESULT(387)
  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -mno-sse -mno-sse2 -mfpmath=387"
  # Note that the -mno-sse* and -mfpmath options are only guaranteed
  # to work with GCC.
  if test x"$GCC" = xyes
  then
    fpmath_may_use_sse=no
  fi
  ;;

  AC_MSG_RESULT(sse+387)
  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -msse -mfpmath=sse,387"

  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -msse2 -mfpmath=sse,387"
  ;;

  AC_MSG_ERROR([bad value ${enableval} for --enable-fpmath, needs sse, sse2, 387, sse+387, sse2+387, default or no])
  ;;

```
As you can see just saying "no" leaves you with the same thing as "default" and that is 387 and sse. Same thing for coefficient:

```
enableval=mpz
AC_MSG_CHECKING([the type of integral values to use as coefficients])

Again mpz is the default if you don't pass anything. 

So unless you have patched these behaviors - and you didn't, we have very similar configurations, we pass 

```
--disable-debugging --disable-optimization --enable-ppl_lpsol --disable-pch --disable-watchdog
```
Since I have a different result for two different x86 setup I am wondering
if the great age of my home machine (close to 8 years) is a factor.

o  Fixed the semantics of the `--disable-fpmath' configure option
   (which is equivalent to `--enable-fpmath=no').  It now disables all

   abstractions based on floating point numbers.

o  The PPL no longer overwrites the SIGILL signal handler.

o  Minor documentation fixes.

o  Portability improved.

Hi Marshall, 

Sage-4.7.alpha2 hasn't been released yet, you are cheating :-P  

It seems like Cython-0.14.1 got smarter and now translates the C++ `std::invalid_argument` exception into a Python `ValueError`, while the older Cython only threw a nondescript `RuntimeError`. So I don't have to catch the exception any more, perfect. Attached patch fixes the doctest, I only removed the try/except block in `divisor()`.

For anybody who is still using Sage-4.6.x: You will encounter one doctest failure but that is harmless.

I finally **got** the problem with the maximize/minimize doctest failure. If the linear function is not bounded on the polyhedron then it doesn't make sense to ask for whether its a maximum or minimum. And PPL then does not return a consistent value for the corresponding field. 

In the attached patch I changed return value of the maximize/minimize methods to only return `{'bounded':False}` if the linear program is unbounded, since all other dictionary entries are not well-defined in that case. If the linear program is bounded then the returned dictionary is the same as before and contains information about the sup/inf value, whether it is a maximum, and where it is attained.

The new patch `trac_10039_ppl_fix_extremize.patch` needs to be applied on top of `trac_10039_parma_polyhedra_library.patch`, see also the ticket description. The new patch needs review.
