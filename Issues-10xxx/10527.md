This one contains "attach" statements, which seems very strange and probably causes many problems. 

The header is also bad.

And QuiverMutationType is not recognized as a global command.

Somehow, all my changes belonging to this patch got into the next on cluster algebras and quivers...

On my computer, everything seems to be fine after moving all these changes into this patch, and all doctests pass.

What did you mean by:

 It appears that `C(M)` and `C(M')` are isomorphic Cartan types for mutation equivalent skew-symmetrizable matrices `M` and `M'`.

A3 is mutation equivalent to an oriented cycle, whose Cartan type is affine A2.  Maybe this should be removed?

Hi Hugh,

If I am not mistaken, this is the only dependency of this patch on #10538. What about the following:

- we take this method off this patch and add it to the other
- you can review of this patch (I guess, we might need some time for that already)
- you can spend more time on the other patch. It would be great, if we can get it reviewed this week, but this will be far from easy...

Thanks, Christian

could you please use the patches in the combinat queue, since I am certain that they are up-to-date, while I lost track over the months if I always updated the version on the trac server.

I pushed a new version to the combinat queue.

A small issue I see is that the internal functions on the bottom are documented, but the documentations don't contain any tests.

If you have any questions, or if you need help, please let me know!

Okay, I agree, BB,1,1 should be undefined.

I'm confused about the notation you're using for some of the exceptional finite mutation type classes.  The non-simply-laced finite mutation type mutation classes are classified in Felikson-Shapiro-Tumarkin, arXiv:1006.4276.  They __are__ elliptic root systems (F-S-T say this), contrary to what's in the package now, and as a result I would rather get them using Saito notation.  But I don't see how the data for them match up with the data in F-S-T.

---
Here's another question: for the most part, the third parameter is redundant.  I think the third parameter should only be used for the Kac convention (in affine root systems) and the Saito convention (in elliptic root systems).  

The only other information you're using it for is when you want to indicate the check in the other convention for affine roots.  But "check=true" would be easier to remember.

I also think it might be helpful to indicate references for the different conventions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynkin_diagram#Affine_Dynkin_diagrams

seems to be a pretty good reference for the affine diagrams using the Kac convention.  And the convention Macdonald uses is recorded online at 

http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/24729/excerpt/9780521824729_excerpt.pdf

Then there is possibly a more canonical reference for Saito than F-S-T.

It seems potentially confusing that "rank" is an argument for creating the object and also an attribute of the resulting object, but they aren't equal.  I guess all I'm really asking for is that the parameter for creating the object should have a different name.

Yes, that's right.

But if you think that's too much, or not needed, we can as well delete it. You can maybe ask for another opinion on that at the sage days.

me neither, but I discussed that with Gregg, and we thought that we just include them. If you really think no one will ever try to use them, then we can as well delete them.

I think of AE as an affine type A plus an extra edge, so the logic is still the same (though the only point where it is visible that we have affine type A is that we use (a,b) as a second parameter in order to say how many edges are oriented in which direction.

I added Gregg as cc, so he can also give his opinion...

Yes, I am workiing on a review patch.  I can do this there.

The non-simply-laced finite mutation type mutation classes are classified in Felikson-Shapiro-Tumarkin, arXiv:1006.4276.  They __are__ elliptic root systems (F-S-T say this), contrary to what's in the package now, and as a result I would rather get them using Saito notation.  But I don't see how the data for them match up with the data in F-S-T.

X_6 and X_7 (The Derksen-Owen quivers, which are skew-symmetric) are not elliptic.  But the sporadic non-skew-symmetric mutation-finite valued quivers are elliptic.  This means they have elliptic-sounding names (eg G<sup>(1,3)</sup>).  However, the elliptic-looking quivers are different from the ones which you've provided.  Do you want to use the quivers you provided, or the elliptic-looking ones in (for example) FST?  Also, do you have a reference for the quivers you provided?

The reason we still use it is in order to make it a priori clear for the user what kind of type he/she is using: None for finite 1 for affine, 2 for mutation finite, and 3 for mutation infinite.

Okay, I'll get a second opinion.  But note that the system you are using is actually less straightforward than that, since if, for example, you invoke a finite mutation type via a family like T, you have to enter a 3 anyhow.

Great.  If people are using Macdonald notation, how do you feel about making them say "affine=true" for affines (if we now reserve "twist" for Kac and Saito notations)?

I guess it does no harm to include BE, CE, DE.  The reason AE's notation seems different to me is that BE, CE, DE have "B on one end, E on the other", while this is not really true for AE (the A is really affine A, not finite A, and there isn't anything very E-like about adding an edge at an arbitrary point).  I'm inclined to remove it.

I am fine with using Rank2, Triangle, Grassmannian for the type names if it is more instructive to a user, but if it seems reasonable, would also keep the shorter 'R2', 'TR', and 'GR' as shorter inputs that then coerce to the longer names.

Regarding the issue of the "twist" parameter which is either 'None' for finite, '1' for affine, '2' for mutation-finite, or '3' for other, I am open to suggestion.  

We definitely want to distinguish Cartan finite from Cartan affine, or the elliptic types, and wanted some other useful sequences.  

In future implementations, we foresaw including other quiver sequences such as the Generalized Glick quivers, Somos 4 and 5 quivers (or other Gale-Robinson sequence quivers) or those coming from a Q-system, and quivers from other surfaces, so we would want an infrastructure that easily allows a user to encode quiver types from certain families.  This was part of the mutation for including a twist parameter but maybe its extraneous.

Alright, please also pull my changes (I hope that we don't have any conflicts in the merge!).

We can maybe have a quick skype session later today or tomorrow...

Best, Christian

QuiverMutationType_Reducible inherits from QuiverMutationType_Irreducible, so all methods not implemented there, are gotten automatically from the irreducible case. In the reducible case, I only implemented the methods that are **different** in both casses. Does this make sense to you?

I basically took this idea from Nicolas' implementation of CartanType: CartanTypeFactory just delegates different input to the right place -- we have an object

```
QuiverMutationType = QuiverMutationType()
```

and if the input is irreducible, we return a QuiverMutationType_irreducible object and if the input is reducible we return a QuiverMutationtype_reducible object. Moreover, QuiverMutationType also provides samples of quiver mutation types, see the samples methods in the factory.

PS: I just see that the docstrings for samples and _samples are still saying Cartan type instead of QuiverMutationType, could you replace that while you're on the file -- thanks!

Just my 2 cents: this is an abuse since a reducible cartan type is not
an irreducible cartan type (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a). It
would be preferable to introduce an upper class from which both would
derive.

I have not made any new changes.

It seems to me that this could reduce the amount of cluster-algebra-specific code, since a bunch of things are implemented for cartan_type.

I think the right thing to do is to implement a CartanType for general root data -- the general version would probably mainly know about its Cartan matrix, for starters, but eventually you'd want it to know about the associated Weyl group, for example.

Hi Hugh --

I recently implemented a CartanMatrix (available in the patch on reflection groups). I now added a patch

```
trac_10527-quiver_mutation_type-ht.patch
trac_???-cartan_matrix_for_quiver_mutation_type-cs.patch
```

and now, we have the following behaviour:

```
sage: mt = QuiverMutationType(['A',3])      
sage:  C = mt.cartan_matrix()              
sage:  G = C.reflection_group()
sage:  G.cardinality()
24

sage: mt = QuiverMutationType(['GR',(10,3)])
sage:  C = mt.cartan_matrix()
sage:  G = C.reflection_group()
sage:  G.cardinality()
+Infinity
```

Sweet, he? Beside that, the class CartanMatrix is not yet very advanced, and several important decisions are still to be made (e.g., how should CartanMatrix, CartanType, RootSystem, RootSpace, and so on, interact?), but that's a different topic.

How do you think to change the organization of the methods by using CartanMatrix (or CartanType)?

Best, Christian

Having cartan_type return a Cartan matrix would seem just natural to
me, as long as all operations on cartan types (building the root
system, the weyl group, ...) are available from a cartan matrix (they
should). In the long run, we probably want to rename all our
cartan_type methods to cartan_datum.

Hello, Christian and Nicolas--

The Cartan matrix for finite type B is the same, whether we go via CartanType or QuiverMutationType (good, and not a surprise).  However, it is transposed compared to what is in Bourbaki (surprise, and probably not so good).  The same thing is true of finite type C.  

Is this some difference of choice of convention, or is it a bug?  

(I started looking at affine types, because there seems as if there might be some confusion there also, but I guess to begin with, it would be good if I understood the convention in finite type.)

cheers,

Sorry, I hadn't yet looked at quiver.py, and wasn't aware of all that was in there.  At a first glance, I'm very happy to see that this exists!

I don't know what the rules/principles for organizing sage code are, but it seems to me that the quiver stuff will be of interest well beyond its cluster algebra applications.

Thanks for pointing me to #12630.

I'm not really seeing the logic of what is being done here (well, really I mean #10538) vs what is being done there vs what is now being done both places.  I realize that you and Jim Stark didn't sit down and plan this out a year ago!

There is some functionality which you have which he doesn't (eg, reflection functors), as well as functionality which he has and you don't, and I think the right thing to do is to think about merging.  

This suggestion isn't intended to impact any of the cluster algebra code, which has a different orientation and solves a different set of problems (in particular, I get it that in cluster algebras, it's most natural to have mutable quivers, while Jim wants immutable quivers).

I think it would be good to add a note to this effect to the documentation for the cartan_matrix of a CartanType, and probably also for the cartan_matrix of a QuiverMutationType.

Hi Nicolas and Christian--

The only relevant reference I found to Bourbaki is in root_system/cartan_type.py where it says that the *numbering* of roots follows Bourbaki.  What I am saying is not contrary to this.  

In sage-combinat-devel, in June of 2008, in the thread "tensor product of crystal code", I found Dan Bump saying the following:

> It says so in the documentation:
> > The edge multiplicities are encoded as edge labels. This uses the
> > convention in Kac / Fulton Harris Representation theory
> > wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynkin_diagram, that is for i != j:

> > j -k-> i  <==>  a_ij = -k  <==>  -scalar(coroot[i],root[j]) = k
> > <==>  multiple arrows point from the longer root to the shorter one

>
> That is the standard convention but in fact what is implemented is

>
> j -k-> i <==> a_ji = -k

>
> See this line in cartan_matrix.py():

>
>    cmf = lambda i,j: 2 if i == j else -f(j,i)


Since Kac and Bourbaki are contradictory (according to F&Z), everything is consistent.  

Dan seems to be unaware that the Kac convention which he calls "standard" is contrary to Bourbaki, but this would be an easy thing not to be aware of.  

I still think it would be useful to say explicitly in the cartan_matrix methods of CartanType and QuiverMutationType that the cartan_matrix is according to !Kac/Fulton-Harris and contrary to Bourbaki.  

I did also double-check the Dynkin diagrams, and they are correct consistent with this.  

And just to clarify, that means that all the finite type QuiverMutationTypes are consistent with what was already in Sage and consistent with Fomin and Zelevinsky (which is not surprising -- otherwise I'm sure it would have been picked up on already).  

cheers,

Hugh

Hi!

I have some further mathematical corrections to QuiverMutationType.  

Affine C is CC (not BC).  

D,n,2 is BB,n-1,1 (not CC,n,1).  

G,2,1 and G,2,-1 are reversed from what they should be.  (When this is fixed it will also fix D,4,3)

For consistency, I think: 
* C,n,-1 should return the dual of C,n,1, i.e., BB (right now it gives an error).
* B,n,-1 should return the dual of B,n,1, i.e., CD (ditto)
  
I think I have now checked the data for affine types.

I will go ahead and make these changes but I wanted to record them here in case anyone had any corrections to my corrections.  

cheers,

Hugh

I've made a few more minor changes, mostly to the documentation, and also catching that (T,(2,4,4)) = (E,7,1). I hope to be done #10527 soon! 

I think the property "affine" should only be implemented for irreducible 
quiver mutation types.  It's not clear what it means for an reducible 
quiver mutation type to be affine.  (A product of two affines is, in my view,
less affine than a product of an affine and a Dynkin is, since in the 
latter case, but not the former, the radical of the symmetric form is 
one-dimensional.)

I feel similarly about "elliptic" (though I have less mathematical knowledge to back up my gut feeling that the product of two elliptics isn't very elliptic).  

Thoughts?

I will look more at the documentation and get back to you.  Perhaps these should be changed backed, I thought the single colons were simply typos so might have changed these in error.

Thanks for the heads up, although Line 1457 is an example rather than part of the source code.  Hence why there is no "print" command there.

Hi,

I updated Gregg's patch (and deleted the one he accidentally added), and also set the double colons right (Gregg,please confirm). Unfortunately, I somehow cannot build the documentation (and Gregg cannot either). Hugh, could you please recheck? Also, the patchbot is down.

I hope everything is fine now, let's see what the patchbot says and also how we get the docbuild running again.

Okay, it worked on my computer as follows (I am not saying this is the way to go, but it happened to work): after building a new branch, I pushed the three patches above, and then ran

```
sage -docbuild -i reference html
```
This failed with some ascii error somewhere but running 

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
afterwards then rebuilt everything (which was needed in order to get the folder `cluster_algebra_quiver` recognized by the documentation builder.

The doc looks good, in particular the colons in various places.

Best, Christian

I fiddled a little bit with phrasing in the documentation.  

I made the titles referred to in the class_size method agree with the articles being referred to.

**

There is a mention in the documentation of "class_size" that the formulas for affine B and affine C
have been proved, but the proof is unpublished.  In the code, though, it says that the formulas are not proved.  This should be corrected to be consistent.  I didn't do it myself because I wasn't completely clear which formulas it was being claimed had been proved: affine C and its dual (which is not affine B) or affine C and affine B (and their duals) or just affine C and affine B.  

I think I see that the elements of a class and its dual class are 
naturally in bijective correspondence in acyclic types, but it's not obvious
to me outside that setting (though that's all that matters here).

Hi Dmitrii--

The patches are all to be applied, in order.  The patchbot is doing the right thing.  Patch 2 of the 4 ("-ht.patch") has some wierd mercurial business at its front end, which the authors are aware of and will fix.  

There are no non-merged dependencies.  The general plan for the cluster algebra implementation is at #10298.  

cheers,

Hugh

Hi!

I posted a thread on sage-devel about the sagepad.org patchbot -- it seems to be having a problem, as it is failing every patch.  

Volker's patchbot, though, Fedora/17/x86_64/3.5.2-3.fc17.x86_64/volker-desktop.stp.dias.ie, seems to be being confused by the lazy import.  (Search for "lazy_import" in the patchbot log file.)  

I don't know what the right thing to do about that is.  The easy option would be to change the import back to normal, and leave it to someone else who knows lazy imports (and maybe also the patchbot) better, to fix it.  Since there is no special reason that the cluster stuff has to be lazily imported, this seems pretty reasonable to me.  

cheers,

Hugh

Since there is no special reason that the cluster stuff has to be lazily imported, this seems pretty reasonable to me.


I looked a bit, and the place it is failing at is when trying to
figure out which names would be imported by the "*"
(sage.misc.lazy_import.get_star_imports). And indeed this piece is a
bit tricky and therefore likely to be brittle.

I would suggest to avoid using the "*" feature of lazy_import by either:

(1) Puting explicitely in combinat.all the list of things to be lazily imported:

    lazy_import("sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.all", "QuiverMutationType,...", overwrite=False)

(2) Replace the "lazy import *" in combinat.all by a usual import *,
    and use instead lazy imports on each piece in
    sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.all

Solution 2 has the advantage of not having to touch again combinat.all
in later patches, knowing that this file is very often changed and
therefore a source of potential conflicts.

By the way: unless there is a strong reason not to, I would not leave
"overwrite" to its default value.

Cheers,
                                           Nicolas

I already see that this makes the startup modules plugin unhappy. Is that still fine, or do we have to find a different solution (I import cluster_algebra_quiver.all in combinat.all, and then lazily import QuiverMutationType inside cluster_algebra_quiver.all)?

One patchbot doesn't like the startup but does like the coverage, and it's the other way round with the other patchbot...

Gregg, you said you wanted to fix QuiverMutationType('C',1,1) giving a cryptic message, but in fact it still does (it still says "'CC',1,1" is not valid).

Yay!  Hopefully the patchbot will again be happy after it processes the new patch.  Yes, this seems related to https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/sage-devel/patchbot$20plugin$20start-up$20modules/sage-devel/6LByB07Ks9c/gU1TCecUwwoJ

I forget now why we allowed switching the order of k and n.  Christian, do you remember?  Anyway, Hugh I agree with you, and made the change.  QuiverMutationType('GR',(5,2)) for instance now gives an error.  But we still have QuiverMutationType('GR',(3,5)) = QuiverMutationType('GR',(2,5)).

There has to be some notation for it, and it's pretty peculiar to require people to think of the root system as derived from D,3 rather than A,3.

This was from following Kac's affine notation, which didn't allow A_3^(2).  

However, coercing to ('D',3,2) might be a better choice than an error message here.  Unfortunately, ('A',3,2) doesn't resemble ('A',2k+1,2) in this case, but perhaps this is okay.  Christian, feel free to let us know if you have a different preference.  By the way, I just ran

```
sage: CartanType(['A',3,2])
['B', 2, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['D',3,2])
['C', 2, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['A',4,2])
['BC', 2, 2]
sage: CartanType(['A',5,2])
['B', 3, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['A',7,2])
['B', 4, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['D',4,2])
['C', 3, 1]^*
sage: CartanType(['D',5,2])
['C', 4, 1]^*
```

as a sanity check, and it actually *does differ* from this choice.  Should we make 

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['D',3,2])
['BB',2,1]
sage: QuiverMutationType(['A',3,2])
['CD',2,1]
```

instead?

Also, in my most recent patch, I also did the following:

*  I separated out the cases ['F', 4, [1,2]] and ['F', 4, [2,1]], as well as 
['G', 4, [1,3]] and ['G', 4, [3,1]] in the class QuiverMutationType_Irreducible.  

This is in preparation for changes I will be making to the ClusterQuiver class.  These specific changes used to be in the ticket #10538, see item (8a) of http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10538#comment:18, but since I was changing this patch anyway, this ticket was a more natural place to have these changes. 

Once we have finalized this ticket, I will update #10538 accordingly to fix the impending patch conflict.

* I also added the coercions ['F',4,[2,1]] -> ['F',4,[1,2]] and ['G',2,[3,1]] -> ['G',2,[1,3]] up front in the Mutation Type Casting list to make this separation clearer.  The point is that we can think of these four cases each as different quivers, even though the two quivers of type F listed here are mutation-equivalent, and same for the elliptic G quivers listed here.

Similarly, the values ['GR', [2,n]] and ['TR',1], ['TR',2] are now allowed as inputs to QuiverMutationType_Irreducible

* See also the discussion in comments 23-25 of #10538.  I also now allow the user to type in

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['A',[0,7],1])
['D',7]
```

This will later allow the user to construct the cyclic quiver on n-vertices by specifying 0 clockwise arrows in a quiver of "type affine A".  Note that such a quiver is actually of finite D type, not affine A.

I agree that (2,5) and (3,5) should be the same, certainly!

Interesting!  He really writes D_3<sup>(2)</sup> and not A_3<sup>(2)</sup>?  I'm surprised.  To me, it seems in some sense like a feature not a bug that you can ask for A_3<sup>(2)</sup> and you will be confronted with the one thing it has to be, even if that wasn't what you were expecting.

In fact CartanType('B',2,1) and CartanType('C',2,1) only differ by a reordering of the roots.  This is consistent with our current choice, to treat QuiverMutationType('B',2,1) as a synonym for QuiverMutationType('C',2,1).  It's also consistent with letting CartanType('A',3,2) and CartanType('D',3,2) be the same (since QuiverMutationType orders roots differently from CartanType anyway).

No.  There is no diagram 'CD',2,1.  (In the sense that it isn't drawable.)

Gregg, I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do with the code for the non-simply-laced elliptics.  

It seems to me that the code constructing the digraph for F,4,[2,1] is never called, because that input is automatically recast as F,4,[1,2] before that point in the code is reached.  

But if that code were run, I think it would cause problems.  As it stands, we have a quiver mutation type called F,4,[1,2].  It has certain attributes, including a digraph.  If you could ask for F,4,[2,1] and get a mutation type that was also called F,4,[1,2] but which had a different digraph, I think that would be really confusing (and I think it would screw up the cached methods, too).  

It is certainly natural for users to ask for a specific quiver.  But if someone really wants to ask for a specific quiver, I don't think the right mechanism for them to do it is for them to ask for a QuiverMutationType by a synonym.  They should just ask for the quiver they want, and get that quiver (as an actual quiver, not as a mutation type).

I think we should think of QuiverMutationType(X) as just giving you a default quiver, on the assumption that the user hasn't really specified a particular quiver.  

This is also my real issue with the synonyms you added.

I applied them again, and it worked well -- I agree that it is better to leave the changes on constructing other quivers to the other patch, so we have some time for discussions on design issues...

All this filesystem activity seems to be one of the primary reasons for slow Sage startup time (perhaps even more so than the execution of the .py files themselves) and if we're going to try to fix that it's important to be careful about what continues to be added.

Thanks for your comments again. Are you suggesting to lazily importing * ? We first did that but the patchbot didn't like it (i.e. some tests failed, see Comments [comment:95] and [comment:97] above), that's why we then did it another way.
