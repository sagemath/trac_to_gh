I have noticed the following problem.

```
P=Posets.PentagonPoset()
P.mobius_function_matrix().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 5 sparse matrices over Rational Field
```
The Mobius function of a poset should really be an **integer matrix**. This can be achieved by using change_ring :

```
P.mobius_function_matrix().change_ring(ZZ).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 5 by 5 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
```

The patch does this by default. It also adds optional arguments to choose sparse/dense and the base ring. Same thing for lequal_matrix.
It also makes sure those matrices are immutable, and improves a bit the redefinition of .mobius_function when the mobius function has been calculated.

Hi Frédéric,

Thanks for taking care of this problem.

Here are a few remarks:

- The field Author below is used to give credits after each release. You
  should put your real name here and not your login.

- If you think returning a matrix over `QQ` is a bug, then you should
  make sure by a doctest that the bug is indeed fixed, indicating in comment
  the ticket number for this bug.

- I can easily imagine use cases where the Moebius function is needed over a
  different ring (eg: Z2 or a polynomial field). What about having an
  optional argument `ring` with a default value `ZZ` to avoid
  changing the ring twice ? In this case for consistency,
  `.mobius_function_matrix()` should also take this optional parameter too.
  What do you think ?

Right now, I'm having lunch, but I'll probably find the time to post a review
patch this evening if you don't beat me. If you start working on it please put
a message here so that we avoid doing it twice. Of course I'll do the same. In
any case one of us will have to do some review and the other to write some
code.

Florent
