Florent Hivert reports on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/bb636656e2153332) that Sage refuses to start after building 4.6.rc0 from scratch on openSUSE 11.3:

```
popcorn-*age/sage-4.6.rc0 $ ./sage 
[...]
    ImportError: No module named sagenb 
```
According to the thread, the problem seems to be that installing the sagenb package does not yield an

 `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`

that contains any path to the Sage Notebook files.

This is a possible follow-up to #10097, which is supposed to replace the line `./sagenb-0.8.2-py2.6.egg` --- inserted by setuptools into `easy-install.pth` --- with `../../../../devel/sagenb`.

Hi there,

Actually I had the same error with a openSuSE 11.1 (64 bits if it maters).

So we can exclude the possibility of a broken `sed` I guess...

I really would try just adding `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to (the generation of) SageNB's `spkg-install`, since apparently Sage 4.6.rc0 built fine and passed all tests on Skynet's OpenSuSE 11.1 box (menas).

(If one changes that, one could of course also add some debug code to see if and how the `easy-install.pth` gets modified; also, one should check more exit codes in the script.)

Florent, please (apply,) build, test and report! ;-)

Hmmm, so something else goes wrong (i.e. there's no sagenb path listed there at all, unless my grep failed for some reason...)

Btw, it should have been sufficient to just install the patched spkg.

Can you take a look at / post your `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`?

Maybe we have a race condition in editing that? (You could retry with `./sage -f ...` when your build has finished.)

To brute-force-fix your problem without knowing the real cause, we could just add:

```sh
# Dave says Solaris' non-POSIX grep in the default path
# doesn't understand "-q" (which *is* POSIX):

if ! grep sagenb easy-install.pth >/dev/null; then
    echo 'No sagenb path found in easy-install.pth!'
    echo "Adding relative sagenb path to easy-install.pth"
    # Anyone recalling the correct syntax for *sed*?
    ed easy-install.pth >/dev/null <<EOF
$i
../../../../devel/sagenb
.
wq
EOF
fi
```

Opinions?

Looks reasonable. It has been touched at the end of the build. 

I tried a `sage -f ./sage -f ../sagenb-0.8.7-patched.spkg` and get no changes:

I'm not sure what to do... If you have some time, maybe it could be easier to discuss on irc. I'm kind of busy tonight (it is 20:4 here) but I probably can find 1/2h if you need. I've no idea how this `setup.py/easy-install` stuff works and what could be the cause...

So the modification time did not change when running `./sage -f ...`?

I'm not familiar with setuptools, easy-install etc. either... :(

I could perhaps upload a modified patch including the "brute force" fix later, but am busy now, too.

Dave just said he's going to install OpenSuSE 11.3 and / or 11.2 in a virtual machine; perhaps he can help, too, with debugging that.

My install is in `/home/data/Sage-Install` with a symbolic link from `/home/florent/src/...`. I figured out that it could be the source of the problem.

**New spkg: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/sagenb-0.8.7.p1.spkg**

**md5sum:** `6fe0e76e336fc24e71b5c591a112f8fb  sagenb-0.8.7.p1.spkg`

Florent, again: Please install / build, test and report! ;-)

This spkg now contains the work-around **adding** the relative sagenb path to `easy-install.pth` if (for whatever reason) there's no sagenb path at all in it...

I've also updated the spkg patch, and added a cumulative diff for reference / review (the Mercurial changeset contains *two* patches), but you can just download and install the new spkg.

(I actually made a mistake in the previously attached patch s.t. the `#!` in `spkg-install` ended up on the *second* line. I'm really curious what messages you will *now* get - either *"Adding relative sagenb path to easy-install.pth"* or *"Making sagenb path in easy-install.pth relative"*...)

I've again tested the spkg (only) on Ubuntu 10.04.

```sh
$ ./sage -f /path/to/sagenb-0.8.7.p1.spkg
$ ./sage -t -long -sagenb # Though there are no long tests IIRC
```
should be sufficient to test it. (Others should perhaps test it on different platforms as well.)

You could then do

```sh
$ egrep "Adding|Removing" spkg/logs/sagenb-0.8.7.p1.log
$ grep easy-install\.pth spkg/logs/sagenb-0.8.7.p1.log # more matches
```
(also with your previous logs, i.e. `spkg/logs/sagenb-0.8.7.log` or `spkg/logs/sagenb-0.8.7-patched.log`).

Leif, thanks for making a new spkg with your improvements.

From `spkg/standard/deps` (cf. #8306):

```
# setuptools forgets to update easy-install.pth during parallel

```
Perhaps `forgets` should be `"forgets"`.  Anyway, I'm mentioning this, in case anyone sees a connection with the behavior Florent sees.

Mitesh, I think we can remove the (non-portable / non-POSIX) `-n` from

```sh
ln -snf sagenb-main sagenb
```
if we first delete `sagenb` (with `rm -f`). (This was introduced at #10097, by [this patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10097/trac_10097-sagenb_relocatability.patch.gz).)

In fact, the `rm -f sagenb` had been there, before I changed the `cp` to `mv`, so the `-n` was IMHO previously superfluous. (I actually assumed you meant `rm -rf`, deleting also the **contents of the directory** pointed to (`sagenb-main`) and copied to `sagenb-main-old` right before, rather than the link itself, to avoid having old files in the directory to which the new files are copied. Right?)

So I'd suggest "uncommenting" the original `rm -f sagenb`, and omitting the `-n` when effectively *[re]creating* (as opposed to *overwriting*) the `sagenb` symbolic link. (We then don't need the `-f` either.):

```sh
...

I just realized that (unless the script exits prematurely) the "modification" time will always change, regardless if the file really got modified, since we do an analogue of

```sh
sed ... file.orig > file.new
mv -f file.new file.orig
```
(Using the unfortunately non-POSIX `-i` (in-place) option of `sed` would avoid this...)

Should we do

```sh
if diff file.orig file.new >/dev/null; then
    rm -f file.new # just clean up
else
    mv -f file.new file.orig
fi
# or, in short form:
diff file.orig file.new >/dev/null && rm -f file.new || mv -f file.new file.orig
```
? ;-)

Unfortunately `export DISTUTILS_DEBUG=yes` seems to have no effect on setuptools, but perhaps we could call `distutils.log.set_threshold(distutils.log.DEBUG)` in SageNB's `setup.py` (haven't tried that yet).

Or we could hack some debugging statements into the setuptools spkg by ourselves, since there anyway aren't many calls of `log.debug()`, at least in the parts we're interested in.

Our setuptools are fairly old by the way; the latest seem to be 0.6c11, released a year ago, though some changelog ends with "0.6 (final)", lacking entries for "recent" 0.6c*N*s.

> and reinstall the sagenb package, do you see one or more "`Saving .../easy-install.pth`" lines in the log?

You can also just `s/log.debug/log.info/g` with your favorite editor.

I'm attaching a patch to `easy_install.py` that does some more `log.debug()` (inside the I think relevant parts).

(Again, after applying that patch, you could change `log.debug()` to `log.info()`.)

Hmmm, for some reason I get the `Updating easy-install.pth file: "..."` messages, but not the rest... :/

Attachment: **[easy_install.py.debug.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10176/easy_install.py.debug.patch.gz)**

Ok, I've updated the patch to `easy_install.py`, which now also does:

```python
import os 
if os.environ.get("SAGE_SETUPTOOLS_DEBUG","no")=="yes":
    log.set_threshold(log.DEBUG) 
```
such that `export SAGE_SETUPTOOLS_DEBUG=yes` enables the debug output. (I.e., replacing `log.debug` by `log.info` is no longer necessary.)

(Did not work from SageNB's `setup.py`, don't know yet why.)

More infos: I added some more log stuff to the function add:

```
    def add(self,dist):
        if dist.location not in self.paths and dist.location not in self.sitedirs:
            log.info("**************appending %s to pth file"%(dist.location))

        else:

                                      dist.location in self.sitedirs))
        Environment.add(self,dist)

Sorry I uploaded the wrong log where I indeed forgot to export DEBUG... The full correct log is at `http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~hivert/SAGE/lastinst.log`

I'm going to have lunch.

Should that be `self.sitedirs`, according to the output `####### False,True`?  Adding a statement to print this, I always get

```python

If I run `easy_install pep8` in a Sage subshell, the relative path to sagenb in `easy-install.pth` is made absolute again.  Does anyone else see this?  This is probably a separate problem, though.

Indeed !

The initial source of the `sitedirs` seems to be `get_site_dirs`, which gives

```python
sage: from setuptools.command.easy_install import get_site_dirs
sage: get_site_dirs()
['/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/apps/sage-4.6.rc0/local/lib/python2.6', '/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/apps/sage-4.6.rc0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages', '/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/apps/sage-4.6.rc0/local/lib/site-python']
```
This function begins

```python
def get_site_dirs():
    # return a list of 'site' dirs
    sitedirs = filter(None,os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH','').split(os.pathsep))
...
```
and later appends the paths I get above.

```python
sage: os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH','')
':/home/mpatel/apps/sage/local/lib/python'
```
Do you see a sagenb path here?

Wow, this seems like it is really turning into a mess.  Maybe we should just pretend to install in the normal place (the site-packages directory) and then move that directory to the SAGE_DEVEL directory and create a relative symlink from site-packages/sagenb... to SAGE_DEVEL/sagenb ourselves?

I've finally found the problem: it has nothing to do with openSUSE (I've
reproduced it on `sage.sagemath.org`). I had the environment variable
`SAGE_PATH` set to `.` (don't ask me why) ! When this is the case,
during the installation of sagenb, python is able to find sagenb into its path
and therefore refuse to add it to `easy-install.pth`. I don't want to edit
the header of this ticket because I'm not sure what is the right decision
here.

As said on the IRC, I don't think this works with (at least our current) unpatched setuptools; these expand symbolic links such that if I create

```
local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb -> ../../../../devel/sagenb
```
and add `./sagenb` to `easy-install.pth`, installing different spkgs using setuptools again replaces this by an absolute path.

Despite that, I don't think this needs to remain a 4.6 blocker.

Of course I can upload the p2 spkg (though the p1 also works around the issue, and it seems rather unlikely other people will run into this, or they could at least now find a simple solution...)

We could improve the SageNB spkg in 4.6.1 as well, along with changes to setuptools and / or `sage-location`.

Anyway, going to upload the second patch (to get the p2 version, which also removes the non-portable `ln -snf ...`). (I haven't made more changes to it since yesterday, i.e. the changes are those I mailed you.)

;-) Well, since SageNB moved from a more or less typical spkg to something more like the Sage library, I expect more people - potentially less familiar with the SageNB update process - to work on it.

So it's now IMHO more likely developers will have a broken (or outdated) Sage in their default path (i.e., outside a Sage subshell), in which case "arbitrary" things could happen.

If `sage-env` was sourced, i.e. some variables like `SAGE_LOCAL` or `SAGE_ROOT` are defined*, we can perhaps be more sure `sage` is the "proper" one, i.e. more recent.

My Mercurial patch(es) contain a lot of commit messages with notes; the diff was not intended to get merged.

At the moment the whole purpose of the spkg is to aid debugging the problems mentioned on sage-devel; nobody opened a ticket I asked for, or replied on that thread yet.

In case the spkg helps, I suggest opening a new ticket with a description of the newly encountered problems, then "clean" Mercurial patches, and with just a back-reference to this ticket since the two patches from here will (most probably) be also included there.

[Error] messages given by my current spkg may lead to further work. I can't do that until I get some feedback and know what's really going wrong.

Testing upgrading *with the current buildbot / scripts* seems less useful; cf. sage-release.
