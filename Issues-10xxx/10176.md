Florent Hivert reports on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/bb636656e2153332) that Sage refuses to start after building 4.6.rc0 from scratch on openSUSE 11.3:

```
popcorn-*age/sage-4.6.rc0 $ ./sage 
[...]
    ImportError: No module named sagenb 
```
According to the thread, the problem seems to be that installing the sagenb package does not yield an

 `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`

that contains any path to the Sage Notebook files.

This is a possible follow-up to #10097, which is supposed to replace the line `./sagenb-0.8.2-py2.6.egg` --- inserted by setuptools into `easy-install.pth` --- with `../../../../devel/sagenb`.

Hi there,

Actually I had the same error with a openSuSE 11.1 (64 bits if it maters).

So we can exclude the possibility of a broken `sed` I guess...

I really would try just adding `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to (the generation of) SageNB's `spkg-install`, since apparently Sage 4.6.rc0 built fine and passed all tests on Skynet's OpenSuSE 11.1 box (menas).

(If one changes that, one could of course also add some debug code to see if and how the `easy-install.pth` gets modified; also, one should check more exit codes in the script.)

The attached patch to the SageNB spkg adds `#!...` and some error checking to its `spkg-install`, which now also prints the old and new SageNB path in `easy-install.pth` - at least for debugging...

Florent, please (apply,) build, test and report! ;-)

(I have no idea if that solves the problem, therefore a temporary patch and "needs info". At least we should hopefully be able to track this further down.)

To apply the patch, extract the original SageNB package (best from a Sage shell, since we need a suitable Python installation), cd to `sagenb-0.8.7/src/sagenb/`, then apply the patch and run `./spkg-dist` to create a new `sagenb-0.8.7-patched.spkg`, located in `sagenb-0.8.7/src/sagenb/dist/` (i.e., `./dist/`).

Hmmm, so something else goes wrong (i.e. there's no sagenb path listed there at all, unless my grep failed for some reason...)

Btw, it should have been sufficient to just install the patched spkg.

Can you take a look at / post your `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/easy-install.pth`?

Maybe we have a race condition in editing that? (You could retry with `./sage -f ...` when your build has finished.)

So the modification time did not change when running `./sage -f ...`?

I'm not familiar with setuptools, easy-install etc. either... :(

I could perhaps upload a modified patch including the "brute force" fix later, but am busy now, too.

Dave just said he's going to install OpenSuSE 11.3 and / or 11.2 in a virtual machine; perhaps he can help, too, with debugging that.

On the contrary it *did* change as expected.

My install is in `/home/data/Sage-Install` with a symbolic link from `/home/florent/src/...`. I figured out that it could be the source of the problem. I though I have been careful not to go through the link but it seems I failed. However, on my openSuSE 11.1 I had the same failure without any links. So this is not the cause of the problem.

Mitesh, I think we can remove the (non-portable / non-POSIX) `-n` from

```sh
ln -snf sagenb-main sagenb
```
if we first delete `sagenb` (with `rm -f`). (This was introduced at #10097, by [this patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/10097/trac_10097-sagenb_relocatability.patch).)

In fact, the `rm -f sagenb` had been there, before I changed the `cp` to `mv`, so the `-n` was IMHO previously superfluous. (I actually assumed you meant `rm -rf`, deleting also the **contents of the directory** pointed to (`sagenb-main`) and copied to `sagenb-main-old` right before, rather than the link itself, to avoid having old files in the directory to which the new files are copied. Right?)

So I'd suggest "uncommenting" the original `rm -f sagenb`, and omitting the `-n` when effectively *[re]creating* (as opposed to *overwriting*) the `sagenb` symbolic link. (We then don't need the `-f` either.):

```sh
...
mkdir -p "$SAGE_ROOT/devel"

echo "Copying SageNB package to '$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main'."
if [ -d "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main" ]; then
    echo "Moving old SageNB package to '$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main-old'."
    rm -rf "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main-old"
    mv "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main" "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main-old"
fi

rm -f "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb" # Delete just the link itself (if it exists)

cd ..
cp -pr sagenb "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main"

cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel"
ln -s sagenb-main sagenb
...
```

Opinions? Or do I miss something?

I just realized that (unless the script exits prematurely) the "modification" time will always change, regardless if the file really got modified, since we do an analogue of

```sh
sed ... file.orig > file.new
mv -f file.new file.orig
```
(Using the unfortunately non-POSIX `-i` (in-place) option of `sed` would avoid this...)

Should we do

```sh
if diff file.orig file.new >/dev/null; then
    rm -f file.new # just clean up
else
    mv -f file.new file.orig
fi
# or, in short form:
diff file.orig file.new >/dev/null && rm -f file.new || mv -f file.new file.orig
```
? ;-)

Unfortunately `export DISTUTILS_DEBUG=yes` seems to have no effect on setuptools, but perhaps we could call `distutils.log.set_threshold(distutils.log.DEBUG)` in SageNB's `setup.py` (haven't tried that yet).

Or we could hack some debugging statements into the setuptools spkg by ourselves, since there anyway aren't many calls of `log.debug()`, at least in the parts we're interested in.

Our setuptools are fairly old by the way; the latest seem to be 0.6c11, released a year ago, though some changelog ends with "0.6 (final)", lacking entries for "recent" 0.6c*N*s.

You can also just `s/log.debug/log.info/g` with your favorite editor.

I'm attaching a patch to `easy_install.py` that does some more `log.debug()` (inside the I think relevant parts).

(Again, after applying that patch, you could change `log.debug()` to `log.info()`.)

We are probably getting close. I'm investigating this further. Also: I'll be more or

Florent, did you `export SAGE_SETUPTOOLS_DEBUG=yes` before reinstalling?

More infos: I added some more log stuff to the function add:

```
    def add(self,dist):
        if dist.location not in self.paths and dist.location not in self.sitedirs:
            log.info("**************appending %s to pth file"%(dist.location))
            self.paths.append(dist.location); self.dirty = True
        else:
            log.info("####### %s already in self.paths or self.sitedirs not adding"%dist.location)
            log.info("####### %s,%s"%(dist.location in self.paths,
                                      dist.location in self.sitedirs))
        Environment.add(self,dist)
```

I Mitesh,

Indeed !

{{{#!python

As said on the IRC, I don't think this works with (at least our current) unpatched setuptools; these expand symbolic links such that if I create

```
local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb -> ../../../../devel/sagenb
```
and add `./sagenb` to `easy-install.pth`, installing different spkgs using setuptools again replaces this by an absolute path.

;-) Well, since SageNB moved from a more or less typical spkg to something more like the Sage library, I expect more people - potentially less familiar with the SageNB update process - to work on it.

So it's now IMHO more likely developers will have a broken (or outdated) Sage in their default path (i.e., outside a Sage subshell), in which case "arbitrary" things could happen.

If `sage-env` was sourced, i.e. some variables like `SAGE_LOCAL` or `SAGE_ROOT` are defined*, we can perhaps be more sure `sage` is the "proper" one, i.e. more recent.

At the moment the whole purpose of the spkg is to aid debugging the problems mentioned on sage-devel; nobody opened a ticket I asked for, or replied on that thread yet.

In case the spkg helps, I suggest opening a new ticket with a description of the newly encountered problems, then "clean" Mercurial patches, and with just a back-reference to this ticket since the two patches from here will (most probably) be also included there.

[Error] messages given by my current spkg may lead to further work. I can't do that until I get some feedback and know what's really going wrong.

Testing upgrading *with the current buildbot / scripts* seems less useful; cf. sage-release.
