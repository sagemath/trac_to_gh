>> sage: s=1/2*x;parent(s)
>> sage: s._rmul_?
>> ...
>> Definition:     s._rmul_(self, right)
>> Docstring:
>>      File: sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx

```
This is reversed. 


r*s means that s is on the right side, hence, s._rmul_(r), while s is on the left side in s*r, hence, s._lmul_(r). 

the _rmul_ docs should be:

s._rmul_(self, left)

and say it returns left*self, where left is a rational number.

Thank you for noticing this!  Of course, the code behaves correctly in both cases right now, because the operation is commutative, but I agree the documentation needs to be changed.

This patch seems to be doing exactly the right thing, however, it does not apply cleanly to 4.6.1.rc0.  Is there any chance you might be able to change this?  (In that case, I am happy to run tests etc and give it a positive review.)

Many thanks!

Thank you for the quick reply.

Unfortunately, the patch still does not apply cleanly to 4.6.1.rc0.  It's the second hunk of the patch that fails, i.e., the following

I am not quite sure why this is;  perhaps you accidentally did not upload the updated patch?

Feel free to try again (and I'll check and review it).  Alternatively, I am also happy to fix this myself;  let me know what you prefer.
