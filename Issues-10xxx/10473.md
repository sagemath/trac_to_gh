```
This is reversed. 


r*s means that s is on the right side, hence, s._rmul_(r), while s is on the left side in s*r, hence, s._lmul_(r). 

the `_rmul_` docs should be:

s._rmul_(self, left)

and say it returns left*self, where left is a rational number.

I am not quite sure why this is;  perhaps you accidentally did not upload the updated patch?

Feel free to try again (and I'll check and review it).  Alternatively, I am also happy to fix this myself;  let me know what you prefer.
