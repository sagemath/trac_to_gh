>> sage: s=1/2*x;parent(s)
>> sage: s._rmul_?
>> ...
>> Definition:     s._rmul_(self, right)
>> Docstring:
>>      File: sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx

```
This is reversed. 


r*s means that s is on the right side, hence, s._rmul_(r), while s is on the left side in s*r, hence, s._lmul_(r). 

the _rmul_ docs should be:

s._rmul_(self, left)

and say it returns left*self, where left is a rational number.
