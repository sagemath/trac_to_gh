```
This patch fixes the following problems with the command line fixdoctests option:
* correctly deals with tests for which output it expected but none is generated, or for which no output is expected by some is generated.
* makes fixdoctests play nicely with the changes introduced in #12415
* adds some tests to sage/tests/cmdline.py
* makes the script work slightly better with tests that produce output with varying indentation
* cleans up the code of sage-fixdoctests
* sage-fixdoctests now checks to see if it can write to the specified output directory and if not it prompts the user for a better place to put the file
* the script now takes an optional argument --long so that fixdoctests can also massage --long doctests
* there is an updated usage message for fixdoctests printed by sage --advanced
* there is an updated usage message for fixdoctests in the reference manual

To reproduce this remove all but the first test result from the patch at: #10568

The bug was caused by the script not allowing for the cases when either the expected or computed returns from the doctests were empty. The attached patch does this properly and also cleans up the script a little (well, a lot, actually).

Note that the script lives in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin which is not part of the standard repository. The (new) doctests for the script live in sage/tests/cmdline.py

Looks good to me minus two minors thing:

- you're missing the `::` on line 405 in `tests/cmdline.py`,
- could you de-indent the `AUTHORS:` block in `sage-fixdoctests` and align the extra text by 2 spaces.

Thanks Andrew.

Hi Jeroen, 

I am fairly sure that this failure is because the patch in the scripts directory has not been applied - at least, I get this error if the patch trac_10589--fixdoctest_failures-am.patch has not been applied to the scripts repository and I do not get it when it is applied.

Can you please confirm that both patches have been applied correctly. I'm putting the status back to positive review as I am not sure if you will read this otherwise.

Andrew

After adding a doctest line

```
sage: print err
```
(which I guess all `cmdline.py` tests *should* have):

```
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 416, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    print err
Expected nothing
Got:
    sh: cannot create .tmp: Permission denied
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/scratch/release/merger/sage-5.13.beta0/local/bin/sage-fixdoctests", line 35, in <module>
        doc_out = open(doc_out).read()
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '.tmp'
    <BLANKLINE>
**********************************************************************
```

So the problem is that `sage -fixdoctests` writes to the current working directory, which isn't guaranteed to be writable.

Also: please use `--fixdoctests` everywhere.

Hi Travis, 

FYI, the trivial changes made were:
* in `trac_10589--doctests_for_fixdoctests-am.patch​` two instances of ``-fixdoctests`` were changes to ``--fixdoctests`` and and ``print ret`` was changed to ``print err``
* in `trac_10589--fixdoctest_failures-am.patch` the output is sent to ``doc_out=tmp_dir()+'.tmp'`` rather than just ``.tmp``, which required a new import statement (this was an error in the original `sage-fixdoctests` which wasn't picked up when it was first added to sage...).

Hey Andrew,

Is there some way we could make this behave better when we don't have write permissions to a given directory, such as output query the user or just output to the console?

Hey Jeroen,

Thanks for noticing that, I never would have thought to check write permissions of the current directory.

Best,

Hi Travis,

This already happens. The problem that Jeroen found concerns a tempory file which the sage-fixdoctests script uses to dump the current state of the doc-tests. This file is now written to sage's ``tmp_dir()`` which is always writable.

The only other file that sage-fixdoctests writes is the replacement source file. By default this is put in the same directory as the original source, however, the user can supply an optional argument to have the file written elsewhere:

```
Usage: sage -fixdoctests <source file> [doctest output]
Creates a file <source file>.out that passes the doctests (modulo any raised exceptions)
```

Having said this, I just chcked and this optional argument is not mentioned under ``sage -advanced``, so probably I should add it there. I could also make the script more user friendy and have it remind the user of this when it is unable to write its output file. Is this what you have in mind?

One very minor point, could you put a space after the colon on line 122 in the fixdoctest file? I prefer my prompts like:

```

```
as opposed to:

```

```

After that, you can set this to positive review. Thanks.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A56):
> The `diff` output isn't portable, on Solaris:

This is going to be tricky as I don't have access to a solaris machine so I can't test this. The only difference between the two diffs is where the `+    [0 0 0]` appears.

It seems that the problem may be that `-fixdoctests` uses a universal diff:

```python
os.system('diff -u %s %s | more'%(test_file, test_output))
```
Aunty google suggests that a context diff may work better:

```
os.system('diff -c %s %s | more'%(test_file, test_output))
```
Is anyone able to confirm this?

Looking at this there is also an issue because diff may not be installed on the system, or it may not be in the users PATH. The script should try and trap the resulting errors in these cases...although I'll need to find appropriate exceptions to look for. Of course, in all of these cases this test will fail but I don't see a way around this. Having `diff` installed presumably isn't, and shouldn't be, a requirement for sage.

Is there a way to mark tests for the doc-test suite to ignore a test on certain systems?

Hi Travis,

Sorry, this is my mistake: previously when you tested the script it worked, so the problem you're seeing is not because ubuntu's diff returns the same output as solaris. Rather that when I tested the the new patch I thought that I had the full patch applied but I was in the wrong branch where the patch was not applied. Sorry.

The new output, I hope, should be independent of the system diff as it uses difflib, which is a python module for generating diffs. In any case the new diff is closer to that returned by solaris than the previous universal diff.

With the patch applied, this time, I get the following:

```
sage -t cmdline.py
    [213 tests, 52.19 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 52.3 seconds
    cpu time: 0.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 52.2 seconds
```

The new version of `trac_10589--doctests_for_fixdoctests-am.patch​` is now on trac.

Andrew
