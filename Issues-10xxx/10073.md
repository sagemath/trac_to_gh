See #9879, where this was discovered.  After #9901 is merged, this will be possible:

```

sage: var('I')
I
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(I)
sage: restore('I')
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(I)
```

By the way, that does not happen when you do not use the hold parameter followed by the simplify call :

```
sage: I.log()
1/2*I*pi
sage: var('I')
I
sage: I.log()
log(I)
sage: restore('I')
sage: I.log()
1/2*I*pi

```
So 'I' gets restored but maybe Maxima gets the var('I') which was created and not the default numeric 'I'.

Here is another strange thing:

```
sage: I.log()
1/2*I*pi
sage: J = deepcopy(I)
sage: bool(I == J)
True
sage: J.log()
1.57079632679490*I
```

Yes, Burcin says it has something to do with "a problem with restore and the maxima interface, not pynac".  This seems likely.  I can't explain the second thing.

Something has changed here, probably with #6882:

```
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
1/2*I*pi
sage: var('I')
I
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(_I)
sage: restore('I')
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify()
log(I)
sage: I.log()
1/2*I*pi
sage: I.log(hold=True).simplify_full()
log(_I)
```
This is not encouraging.
