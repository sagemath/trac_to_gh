Even though Maxima can evaluate `sech(0)`, Sage does this:

```
sage: cosh(0)
1
sage: sech(0)
sech(0)
```
It seems reasonable to fix this.  Part of this is probably that `sech` is not a GiNaC function.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Is there a way of initializing a Ginac / Pynac function using a symbolic expression? It would be nice to be able to initialize `sech` by calling simply:

```
GinacExpression.__init__(self, '1/cosh', ... 
``` 

And the result would behave just like defining `sech(z) = 1/cosh(z)` in Sage. Then we'd get (as in sage-5.0.beta9):

```
sage: sech(z) = 1/cosh(z)
sage: sech(0)
1
```

Maybe this is naive...
