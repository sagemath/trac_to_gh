One patch adds the Hermitian inner product, by that name, for use with vectors over the complex numbers.

Second patch is totally doctests, no code changes.  Explains, expands, and cross-references the dot product, inner product, Hermitian inner product and vector norm.

**Depends on:**
1. #10536

**Apply:**

After working with this for a while, I though it better to build off the dot product, rather than the inner product with its custom inner product matrices, due to the havoc that could result by specifying a matrix without the necessary properties for certain algorithms to run properly.

v2 series reflects this change.  On 4.6.2.alpha4 depends only on #10536 now.

This is really good.  Docs are fine, excellent examples.  I could barely think of anything to test. 

```
sage: k.<b> = FiniteField(9); k
Finite Field in b of size 3^2
sage: vector([1,1]).hermitian_inner_product(vector(k,[1,b]))
b + 1
sage: vector([1,i]).hermitian_inner_product(vector(k,[1,b]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError: 
```
Which is a little obscure, especially if this were buried in other code.  Of course, 

```
sage: vector([1,i]).dot_product(vector(k,[1,b]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError: 
```
So I don't know whether this is a reason to deny positive review.  What do you think?  Separate ticket, or fix here?

Separate ticket, or fix here?  \n\nThis routine is an extension of the idea of a dot product.  So I'd say the dot product is broken and needs to be more careful about mixing the two base rings.  Maybe it should check compatibility, and if there is no conflict, then go on its way.  If there is a conflict, the vectors should be converted to a common base ring, then do the dot product.  If that does not work, then the routine should fail gracefully.\n\nSo I'd like that to be on another ticket.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment:5):
> So I don't know whether this is a reason to deny positive review.  What do you think?  Separate ticket, or fix here?  

This routine is an extension of the idea of a dot product.  So I'd say the dot product is broken and needs to be more careful about mixing the two base rings.  Maybe it should check compatibility, and if there is no conflict, then go on its way.  If there is a conflict, the vectors should be converted to a common base ring, then do the dot product.  If that does not work, then the routine should fail gracefully.

So I'd like that to be on another ticket.  If you make the ticket and cc me, then I'll put it on my list for SD 29 next week, and coordinate with this ticket, if necessary.  But I'd like to see this go in pretty much as-is and let improvements to the "plain" dot product improve this routine from outside.

Thanks,
Rob

See #10960 - it's really a problem for multiplication in general, not the dot or Hermitian product, as it turns out, so definitely a different ticket is needed.

Positive review!
