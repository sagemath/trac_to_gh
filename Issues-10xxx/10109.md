I added a section about `sig_on()` in the developer manual.

I split off the part about Cython from `coding_in_other.rst` and put this in a new file `coding_in_cython.rst`.

I also expanded the part about PARI a bit.

New developers manual: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doc/developer/index.html](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doc/developer/index.html)

Component: **documentation**

Keywords: **sig_on developer**

Author: **Jeroen Demeyer**

Reviewer: **Volker Braun**

Merged: **sage-4.7.alpha5**
