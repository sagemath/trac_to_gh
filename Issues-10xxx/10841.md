As reported in [a sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/7d0fdb331d05c557), in 4.6.1 we see that

```
sage: # succeeds

sage: f.integral(x,0,1)
1
sage: # fails
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,1),0]])
sage: f.integral(x,0,1)

ultimately because 0 is special-cased:

```
sage: type(SR(0).integral(x))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(SR(1).integral(x))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

and the code path for a zero in PiecewisePolynomial.integral never coerces to SR, so .function fails.

I've tested this on one machine on an older version of Sage and sage -testall passed, except for 
failing the (presumably unrelated) R-interface file. Also, the code looks good, has the appropriate doctests
and seems to do what is claimed. I want to test it on one more machine before giving it a positive review though.

This applies fine to 4.6.2.rc0 and passes sage -testall -long. Patch reads okay and does what it claims to do.

Thanks very much for making the patch!

Yes, it does. 

Note to DSM: it turns out that you only need the double colon in front of doctests.  So if there is verbiage between the `EXAMPLES` or `TESTS` and the actual indented tests, you only use a single colon there.

Okay, so just so I'm clear: you must use only one colon after EXAMPLE[S] or TESTS if you're going to follow it with text at the indentation level of EXAMPLES and TESTS and not a more deeply indented code section.  If you use two colons, then what comes after *must* be an indented code section, whether you've used "EXAMPLES::" or "EXAMPLE:" and then text and then a bare "::" on a line.

[update: just read kcrisman's explanation. `:^)`]

So does this mean that the merger of my patch for trac #10088 broke the docs?
