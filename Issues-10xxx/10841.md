```

and the code path for a zero in PiecewisePolynomial.integral never coerces to SR, so .function fails.

I've tested this on one machine on an older version of Sage and sage -testall passed, except for 
failing the (presumably unrelated) R-interface file. Also, the code looks good, has the appropriate doctests
and seems to do what is claimed. I want to test it on one more machine before giving it a positive review though.
