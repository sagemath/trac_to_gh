ultimately because 0 is special-cased:

```
sage: type(SR(0).integral(x))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: type(SR(1).integral(x))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

and the code path for a zero in PiecewisePolynomial.integral never coerces to SR, so .function fails.

I've tested this on one machine on an older version of Sage and sage -testall passed, except for 
failing the (presumably unrelated) R-interface file. Also, the code looks good, has the appropriate doctests
and seems to do what is claimed. I want to test it on one more machine before giving it a positive review though.

Yes, it does. 

Note to DSM: it turns out that you only need the double colon in front of doctests.  So if there is verbiage between the `EXAMPLES` or `TESTS` and the actual indented tests, you only use a single colon there.

[update: just read kcrisman's explanation. `:^)`]

So does this mean that the merger of my patch for trac #10088 broke the docs?
