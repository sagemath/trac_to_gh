and the code path for a zero in PiecewisePolynomial.integral never coerces to SR, so .function fails.

I've tested this on one machine on an older version of Sage and sage -testall passed, except for 
failing the (presumably unrelated) R-interface file. Also, the code looks good, has the appropriate doctests
and seems to do what is claimed. I want to test it on one more machine before giving it a positive review though.

Yes, it does.

Okay, so just so I'm clear: you must use only one colon after EXAMPLE[S] or TESTS if you're going to follow it with text at the indentation level of EXAMPLES and TESTS and not a more deeply indented code section.  If you use two colons, then what comes after *must* be an indented code section, whether you've used "EXAMPLES::" or "EXAMPLE:" and then text and then a bare "::" on a line.

[update: just read kcrisman's explanation. `:^)`]

So does this mean that the merger of my patch for trac #10088 broke the docs?
