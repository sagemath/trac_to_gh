I agree with both robertwb and jdemeyer.  When I test it, startup doesn't seem to go down significantly, though the top one or two entries from sage -startup are eliminated.

I think the patch is helpful, but maybe doesn't go far enough to eliminate all imports of a package.

This is interesting, since this patch eliminates the imports with a - next to them in my list of slowest imports in sage -startup.  However, the overall startup time does not seem to diminish appreciably.  I suppose other modules take the "-" places below so that startuptime doesn't really go down?  Or is it that the modules are loaded anyway somewhere else, and loading a module a second time (even in a different module) is insignificant?
