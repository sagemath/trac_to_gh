As a first useful application of the PPL Cython library interface I have changed `sage.geometry.cone.Cone` to use the PPL wrapper instead of `cddlib`. Here is a quick benchmark with a fan that was somewhat challenging:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety_library import toric_varieties_rays_cones
sage: rays, cones = toric_varieties_rays_cones['BCdlOG']
sage: timeit('Fan(cones,rays)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.95 s per loop
```
With the old `Polyhedron`/`cddlib` interface, I got instead

```
5 loops, best of 3: 42.1 s per loop
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:4'></a>1. My concern was that it removes publicly exposed feature that has been in Sage for several months (and is likely to stay there a few months more). So I vote for resurrecting this possibility, which is actually very easy when things are PPL based - you just replace `Polyhedron` with `Polyhedron.rays()`, as you said. More importantly, if PPL will become something that users have to install separately, then ALL of the old code related to polyhedron -> cone should remain untouched, but there should be some new path to go around it. By the way, I am not quite familiar with packages - is it possible to change Sage library during package installation? If not and all PPL-related code should be in the library no matter whether PPL is installed or not, then \"doctest-fixing\" may be a bad approach here.

If you don't want to mention PPL in the documentation (which is quite reasonable), maybe we can add a function like `_Cone_from_PPL` for such input? For the actual class there is no need in this - it is already not supposed to be called directly by users.\n\n   3. Yes, that's what I had in mind. My concern is that when you use PPL representation, you may need to actually change it somehow to get the result. So far in your code you were constructing a new object based on existing one, so that the original is intact, but it seems to me that this step is quite easy to forget and it would be nice to have something forcing  you to do so.\n\n   7.

I think its easier to just go with PPL's ordering. It also matches the behaviour of the Polyhedron class which will reorder generators. We already have the `Cone_of_fan` to keep track of ray orderings with respect to some particular enumeration of rays.

I can add back in a check that the polyhedron is really a cone, perhaps tomorrow. Generating a Cone from a Polyhedron is only for convenience, I don't see any need to make it fast. All actual computations are now done with PPL.

It is very annoying to deal with several objects that are "the same" but are slightly different, e.g. have different ordering of rays. Also, users may have some ideas about "convenient order" and provide rays in it: if I create the first quadrant as `Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])`, I expect that the first ray will be the first basis vector and the second - the second, as it was given. Remembering to add `check=False` is annoying. Making `check=False` default is very dangerous, as I have learned the hard way. I really really want to preserve the order whenever possible. I even plan to add the possibility to manually provide the order of facets and points for lattice polytopes, since it will allow convenient work with Cayley cones and polytopes of nef-partitions - they are easy to create with current code, but keeping track of face duality is very ugly.

I will be very happy to add the sorting myself on top your patch, fixing all affected doctests, so pleeease let me do it ;-)

I am more concerned about validity checks than performance here. And I am also happy to do the necessary copy-pasting here. So you don't really have to do anything, just say that you are OK with it!

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:28'></a>That was indeed useful to think about it! But I didn't change my mind ;-)\n\nRegarding non-strictly convex cones, I think that there is no point in trying to preserve user's order, but it would be nice to state it in the documentation: if users care about the order in these cases, they must use `check=False` option. Otherwise I think the output should be as it is now:\n\n```\nstrict_ray_0, ..., strict_ray_k, line_1, -line_1, ..., line_m, -line_m\n```\n\nFor strictly convex cones I indeed want to work with decorated cones, but I'd rather not call them that way explicitly everywhere. The reason is that these cones are designed for toric geometry and so their rays (or ray generators) correspond to homogeneous coordinates. If I want to have rays `r1, r2, r3` and I want to associate to them variables `x, y, z`, then I would probably create a cone with rays `r1, r2, r3`, and then create a toric variety based on this cone with variable names `x, y, z`. If the order of rays may change during construction, it means that I need to construct the cone, look at the order of rays, and then rearrange my variable names accordingly, if necessary. This is inconvenient, so while mathematically the cone is determined by the set `{r1, r2, r3}` and associated variables are not `x, y, z` or even `x1, x2, x3`, but `x_r1, x_r2, x_r3` and one should refer to them specifying the ray, in practice it is convenient to have some fixed order.

<a id='comment:28'></a>That was indeed useful to think about it! But I didn't change my mind ;-)

Regarding non-strictly convex cones, I think that there is no point in trying to preserve user's order, but it would be nice to state it in the documentation: if users care about the order in these cases, they must use `check=False` option. Otherwise I think the output should be as it is now:

```
strict_ray_0, ..., strict_ray_k, line_1, -line_1, ..., line_m, -line_m
```

For strictly convex cones I indeed want to work with decorated cones, but I'd rather not call them that way explicitly everywhere. The reason is that these cones are designed for toric geometry and so their rays (or ray generators) correspond to homogeneous coordinates. If I want to have rays `r1, r2, r3` and I want to associate to them variables `x, y, z`, then I would probably create a cone with rays `r1, r2, r3`, and then create a toric variety based on this cone with variable names `x, y, z`. If the order of rays may change during construction, it means that I need to construct the cone, look at the order of rays, and then rearrange my variable names accordingly, if necessary. This is inconvenient, so while mathematically the cone is determined by the set `{r1, r2, r3}` and associated variables are not `x, y, z` or even `x1, x2, x3`, but `x_r1, x_r2, x_r3` and one should refer to them specifying the ray, in practice it is convenient to have some fixed order.

That does not mean that others don't need them, but right now one can use current cones with `is_equivalent` instead of `==` and `ray_set` instead of `rays` to disregard the order.

Some more personal experience:
1. The first time I had problems due to order change was with getting nef-partitions from nef.x.

3. Faces of reflexive polytopes and their polars are in bijection. I find it very convenient to write things like
 {{{

}}}
 This eliminates the need for each face to be able to compute its dual. While it is not terribly difficult, it is certainly longer than having no need to do any computations at all. In order to accomplish it, there is some twisted logic in lattice polytopes that ensures that only one polytope in the polar pair computes its faces and the other one then "copies it with adjustments". I hope to redo it in a better way, but at least it is isolated from users, for whom the dual of the i-th face of dimension d is the i-the face of codimension d.

Somewhat related behaviour of other parts of Sage:
1. Submodules compute their own internal basis by default, but there is an option to give user's basis. In the latter case the internal basis is still computed and one has access to either basis. One can also get coordinates of elements in terms of the user basis or in terms of the standard basis using `coordinates` for one and `coordinate_vector` for another and I never remember which one is which. Personally, I think that this design can be improved. But in any case they do have some order on the generators as well as other `Parent`s without strict distinction between decorated and "plain" objects.
2. `QQ["x, y"] == QQ["y, x"]` evaluates to False, so while these rings are generated by the same variables the order matters. (To my surprise, one can also define `QQ["x, x"]` and it will be a ring in two variables with the same name...)

By the way - currently cones DON'T try to preserve the given order of rays, they just happen to do it often and I didn't really notice it in the beginning (or maybe I assumed that cddlib preserves the order and there is no need to do anything). But I consider it a bug.

We can add an option to turn sorting on or off, but, of course, I'd like to have it on by default.

As I said, I will be very happy to do writing of sorting and doctest fixing myself!-)

This notation asks for a polynomial ring over QQ with variables named x and y, correct? Well, `QQ[\"y, x\"]` asks exactly the same, yet the rings are different. So, really, `QQ[\"x, y\"]` asks for a polynomial ring over QQ with the first variable named \"x\" and the second one \"y\".

It is natural to assume that you have specified the order of something when you have written this something in a certain order. Perhaps, the optimal solution is to let `Cone([(1,0), (1,1), (0,1)])` to be the cone generated by three (ordered) rays - all of the given ones. And then have a function like `minimal_ray_generators`. I guess that's kind of what ideals are doing. I didn't think about this option before. And now I am a bit hesitant to implement it since I am not sure how many places in the code rely on the minimality of the set of generators for the strictly convex case...\n\nI do realize that all your points are valid and my arguments significantly reflect my personal taste, however I also do use the toric code in addition to writing it and if I find something to be convenient it is likely that some other people also will find it convenient. Unfortunately, it is a bit hard to say how many (or how few) of these other people would like my way. Although I suspect that not very many will strongly dislike it since it is harmless (except for some potential slow down, which should not be a noticeable issue and I suggest to have a way around it when it is.) I'll ask on sage-combinat for some input.\n\nAt the very least I would like to be able to call a function `sage.geometry.cone.keep_ray_order(True)` that will turn on user-order preservation for the current session, even if the default is not to keep the order. But I still strongly believe in trying to preserve the order whenever possible, i.e. in the strictly convex case. (Overall, this issue is terribly similar to `ambient_ray_indices` discussed some time ago on #9972.)",

I agree that the second form is better (and I think that it is implemented). But in order to implement it efficiently, one still has to copy the face lattice of the original polytope.

Now let's consider faces of a polytope P and of the polytope 2*P. It is also more natural to write

```
for face in P.faces(dim=3):
    print y, 2*y
```
but if you would like 2*y to be a face of 2*P, not just a polytope obtained from y, how should it be implemented? If they are stored in the same order, you can easily and very efficiently iterate over faces and their multiples.

Move on to cones. Let tau be a face of sigma. What is `tau.dual()`? Is it the cone dual to the cone tau or the face of the cone dual to cone sigma which is dual to the face tau? So we need to have a different method name then, `tau.dual_face()` perhaps.

Now let P, P*, C, and C* be Cayley polytopes and cones with their duals. Faces of P and C are in direct relation, let F be a face of P. How should I get the face of C corresponding to it? Perhaps `C(F)` is a natural notation, but how is it going to be implemented? Finding a face generated by rays coinciding with vertices of F is quite inefficient and no matter how it is done the result probably should be cached somewhere. Where? Maybe in P or C and perhaps it is easy to achieve with a special class for supporting polytopes and supported cones. It is probably a good idea to implement this in a long run.

And even when they are implemented, I think that the most efficient implementation will still rely on internal consistency of orders.

Maybe it is mysterious currently that the face order represents duality. Then it is my fault for not documenting it correctly and I will try to fix it. If it was clearly stated in the documentation, with an example how to use it, there would be nothing mysterious about it.

Note also, that I don't want to SORT faces in any particular way. I just want to have related faces in the same order as the "initial ones" happened to be. If nothing else, it leads to efficient implementation, so it is good to do it even if end-users will use some other interface.

What I was trying to say is that some kind of decoration occurs on its own just because rays are internally stored as tuples. If you are really against it and want to store them as sets, that means that anything that uses rays of that cone should refer to complete rays and instead of other lists and tuples with order matching the order of rays you need to use dictionaries with rays as keys. Which certainly can be convenient but you can do it even if cones have some internal order of rays, so I don't see a reason for having extra classes.

I'd rather go with `UnorderedCone()` ;-) I suggested adding a parameter that will turn off sorting for performance gain. I also don't want to have IMPLICIT order, I want to completely and clearly document it in the description of the Cone constructor and its face methods when/if there is any particular order on anything! 

> As far as associating rays with homogeneous variables, I think we really should subclass the multivariate polynomial ring. Then we can convert rays to homogeneous variables and properly check homogeneity of polynomials.


Another good idea, but even after this conversion do you really want to use names like `x_(1,0,0,0,0), x_(0,1,0,0,0), x_(0,0,1,0,0), x_(0,0,0,1,0), x_(0,0,0,0,1), x_(-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)` for coordinates on `P^5`?!

Let's leave `QQ["x, x,"]` and come back to `QQ["x, y"]`. This notation asks for a polynomial ring over QQ with variables named x and y, correct? Well, `QQ["y, x"]` asks exactly the same, yet the rings are different. So, really, `QQ["x, y"]` asks for a polynomial ring over QQ with the first variable named "x" and the second one "y". In the same way I think that `Cone[(1,0), (0,1)])` asks for a cone with the first ray (1,0) and the second ray (0,1).

If we do have 

```
def Cone(..., keep_ray_order=True)
```
then interactive usage will be pretty, yet there will be no performance penalty for internal computations. Users don't construct Kaehler cone explicitly, they call `Kaehler_cone` and somewhere inside there is a call to Cone which is written once and may have as many extra parameters as necessary.

People refer to the first/second/third equation of the system, generator of the ideal etc. all the time even without assigning some labels/indexed names to them. It is natural to assume that you have specified the order of something when you have written this something in a certain order. Perhaps, the optimal solution is to let `Cone([(1,0), (1,1), (0,1)])` to be the cone generated by three (ordered) rays - all of the given ones. And then have a function like `minimal_ray_generators`. I guess that's kind of what ideals are doing. I didn't think about this option before. And now I am a bit hesitant to implement it since I am not sure how many places in the code rely on the minimality of the set of generators for the strictly convex case...

I do realize that all your points are valid and my arguments significantly reflect my personal taste, however I also do use the toric code in addition to writing it and if I find something to be convenient it is likely that some other people also will find it convenient. Unfortunately, it is a bit hard to say how many (or how few) of these other people would like my way. Although I suspect that not very many will strongly dislike it since it is harmless (except for some potential slow down, which should not be a noticeable issue and I suggest to have a way around it when it is.) I'll ask on sage-combinat for some input.

At the very least I would like to be able to call a function `sage.geometry.cone.keep_ray_order(True)` that will turn on user-order preservation for the current session, even if the default is not to keep the order. But I still strongly believe in trying to preserve the order whenever possible, i.e. in the strictly convex case. (Overall, this issue is terribly similar to `ambient_ray_indices` discussed some time ago on #9972.)

I meant that by default they don't even compute a minimal set of generators. But I don't recall any use for non-minimal representation of cones, so I think that there isn't any point to do the same for cones.

We got a reply from Nicolas on sage-combinat, which I copy below:

---
Just two cents from an outsider (I'll certainly will have a need for
Cone's at some point, but don't have practical experience).

When there is no clear cut answer for a design decision, I tend,
whenever possible, to just postpone it; more often than not, the
answer will become clear by itself after accumulating practical
experience. In that case, there could be an option like:

       Cone(rays=[(1,0),(0,1)], keep_order = True)

and the documentation could explicitly specify that the default value
is currently *undefined*, and will be chosen later on. I guess for the
moment I would unofficially set it to False, since that's the cheapest
while True is somehow "adding a feature"; so that's less likely to
break code in case of change later on.

---
So, I guess, I am currently loosing 1:2, unless you have changed your mind ;-)

If not, I propose the following:
1. State in the documentation of `Cone` that by default the order of rays is going to be "fixed but random" and in particular may change in future versions of Sage. (Which may very well happen due to upgrade in PPL. Personally, I don't like when these "random orders" change and it is yet another reason to stick with the user ordering ;-))
2. Add `keep_order=False` to the list of parameters. If `keep_order=True`, well, keep the order as much as possible in the strictly convex case, i.e. through away extra generators from the original ordered list. If `keep_order=True` and the cone is not strictly convex, perhaps give a `UserWarning` like "keep_order=True does not affect not strictly convex cones, see check=False instead!"

<a id='comment:39'></a>Hi Volker, I have started work on the reviewer patch, so please don't change the attached ones. (They don't seem to apply cleanly anymore, but I will take care of it.)

Hi Nicolas, I am adding you to the cc field in case you have further comments on the ray order ;-)

I have realized that
* I mostly care about preserving the order of rays only if they are already the minimal generating rays of a strictly convex cone and
* implementing this does not introduce any performance penalty: once we have constructed the PPL object, we know if the cone is strictly convex or not and we can just compare the number of its rays with the input - it these numbers are the same, then we can use the input rays as minimal generators directly.

So instead of `keep_order` I would like to add the above check. Advantages:
1. It is convenient if the user cares about the ray order, e.g. for constructing an affine toric variety straight from a cone, when one may want to associate particular variable names with particular rays.
2. It allows easy writing of doctests which explicitly show rays without worrying that the order will change in future releases and a bunch of trivial adjustments will be required.
3. It constructs the same cones with `check=True` and `check=False` options in cases when it is indeed OK to use `check=False` option.
4. It is a bit more intuitive to the user and in particular nice for tutorials and live demonstrations.
5. It makes me happy ;-)

Frankly, I cannot really think of any disadvantages...

So - can I proceed and implement this?

3. Modifies the intersection code (discussed above) slightly. This is **not** its final version, I need to play a bit with lattice intersection but I think it is the way to go.

While I was writing it, I ran tests on top of clean sage-4.7.alpha4 and there are breaks which seem to be related to `rays[0].parent()` without `.ambient_module()`. I believe that they are fixed by #10882.

One more patch: I was learning how to use PPL and trying to switch point containment check in cones so that it does not call `polyhedron` method. In the process I have discovered a bug with constructing cones without rays, i.e. like `Cone([], lattice=N)`: the PPL representation in this case didn't know the ambient space of this cone leading to mistakes. It is fixed in the second hunk of the last patch.

Regarding original goal, here are the timings before

```
sage: timeit("c = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)]); (1,1) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 27.8 ms per loop
sage: c = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
sage: timeit("(1,1) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 729 µs per loop
```
and after

```
sage: timeit("c = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)]); (1,1) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 2.3 ms per loop
sage: c = Cone([(1,0), (0,1)])
sage: timeit("(1,1) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 290 µs per loop
```
As we see, even on very simple example we get 10x speedup for "single checks" when most of the time is spent constructing different representations of the cone. When everything is precached and we count only actual containment, we have 3x speed up.

A more complicated example before:

```
sage: c = Cone([(4, 0, 1, 12, 1), (-2, -2, -73, 1, 0), (1, -2, 0, 1, -3), (5, -1, -1,
sage: 1, 1), (-4, 5, 1, 2, 3), (0, -1, -23, 0, 1), (-2, 1, -1, 1, -1), (0, 2,
sage: -3, 1, 0), (-1, 3, 2, -1, 0), (0, 2, -1, 4, 15)])
sage: c.ray_matrix()
[ -4  -2  -2  -1   0   5   0   1]
[  5  -2   1   3  -1  -1   2  -2]
[  1 -73  -1   2 -23  -1  -1   0]
[  2   1   1  -1   0   1   4   1]
[  3   0  -1   0   1   1  15  -3]
sage: timeit("(1,2,3,4,5) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 4.52 ms per loop
```
and after

```
sage: c = Cone([(4, 0, 1, 12, 1), (-2, -2, -73, 1, 0), (1, -2, 0, 1, -3), (5, -1, -1,
sage: 1, 1), (-4, 5, 1, 2, 3), (0, -1, -23, 0, 1), (-2, 1, -1, 1, -1), (0, 2,
sage: -3, 1, 0), (-1, 3, 2, -1, 0), (0, 2, -1, 4, 15)])
sage: timeit("(1,2,3,4,5) in c", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.3 ms per loop
```
(I didn't bother with fresh start timing here.)

Conclusion: Volker's PPL wrapper rocks!
