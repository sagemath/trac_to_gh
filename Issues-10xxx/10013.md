Ok, from the ticket's description, I thought you were only talking about the documentation.

But could you elaborate on what kind of tests you would like to add? I'd say making sure pari functions should be done in pari, not in sage. So the only thing to check is that they are interfaced properly, but if the interface is automatically generated, it does not make much sense to me to test every single function individually.
