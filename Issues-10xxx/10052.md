The attached patch does several things:

- it moves the Steenrod algebra code to a subdirectory of algebras.  For one thing, there are already 4 files, and for another, I hope that more will be added: several people are working on related projects.

- it reimplements the Steenrod algebra using `CombinatorialFreeModule`, which provides a number of conveniences: scalar multiplication is already defined, as are tensor products, etc.  Then for example the antipode or the coproduct can be defined just on basis elements, and the linear extension to all elements is handled automatically.

- it implements another way of computing products, using admissible sequences and the Adem relations.  This provides a good way of checking for bugs: with two completely different algorithms for computing products, one can compute the same product two ways and compare answers.

- it implements sub-Hopf algebras of the Steenrod algebra.  These were classified 35 years ago, and for some applications people want to use sub-Hopf algebras rather than the whole thing.

- the `TestSuite` has been improved: all components now pass, whereas before, we had some failures.  From the *old* steenrod_algebra.py:

```
            sage: TestSuite(A).run() # todo: fix category inheritance for elements of A
              Failure in _test_category:
              ...
              ------------------------------------------------------------
              The following tests failed: _test_category
            Failure in _test_elements
            The following tests failed: _test_elements
```
 From the new one:

```
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra()).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[4,3,2,2,1])).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem')).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='wall')).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='arnonc')).run() # long time
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='woody')).run() # long time
            sage: A3 = SteenrodAlgebra(3)
            sage: A3.category()
            Category of graded hopf algebras with basis over Finite Field of size 3
            sage: TestSuite(A3).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='adem', p=3)).run()
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='pst_llex', p=7)).run() # long time
            sage: TestSuite(SteenrodAlgebra(basis='comm_deg', p=5)).run() # long time
```
 Not only are there no failures, but there are many more executions of the suite.  This yields some repetition, but the method `an_element` varies depending on the values of `basis` and `p`, so there are also new tests run with each execution.

Unfortunately, since the patch moves files around, it is large.  It also trivially affects a few doctests in sageinspect, which means that it requires a patch to sagenb.

I seem to be missing something; here's what I get after applying [attachment:trac_10052-steenrod.patch] to sage 4.6.alpha2:

```
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(5)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'scalar_mult'
```

Are there other patches I should have applied?

Moreover, the notebook patch doesn't apply at all -- I don't know where the directory ``sagenb`` is, let alone the file ``sageinspect.py``.  Any ideas what I could be missing?

As of Sage 4.6.alpha2, this is a little complicated, but with 4.6.alpha3, you can do `hg_sagenb.import_patch("...path_to_patch_file...")` from within Sage to apply it.

The functionality is really great, and I think the documentation is fantastic!

Attachment [trac_10052-steenrod.v2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket10052/trac_10052-steenrod.v2.patch) by @nilesjohnson created at 2010-12-01 14:03:59

Hi John,

I've finally had a chance to look over this patch.  The functionality is really great, and I think the documentation is fantastic!  I noticed a couple of minor issues, and then some larger problems related to sub-Hopf algebras; here goes:

* I really like the [sage.misc.misc.verbose](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/misc/misc.html#sage.misc.misc.verbose) module; I just wanted to remind you about it for  `steenrod_algebra_bases.steenrod_basis_error_check`.  For a lengthy demonstration, try

```
sage: set_verbose(1)
sage: EllipticCurve('11a1').sha().an_padic(5)
```

* Two minor doctest failures; the first occurs because -1 = 10 in GF(11), and Sage prints 10; the second occurs because the way dicts are printed may vary -- to fix that one I suggest testing that the output of the function is equal to the given dict.

```

**********************************************************************
```

* The docstring for `.gens()`, last sentence before EXAMPLES::, should mention the `Q_n`'s too, since both `.gen()` and `.ngens()` mention them.

* `.gen()` fails for pst basis: The following returns an error:

```
sage: SteenrodAlgebra(p=5, profile=[[2,1], [2,2,2]], basis='pst').gen(2)
```

* In the docstring for `.milnor_multiplication_odd()`, could you give a reference for Monks Maple package?

* I think the description of `.homogeneous_component()` is a little misleading: I expected it to return the vector space of elements of homogeneous degree `n`, and thus was surprised to get different answers depending on which basis I used.  Of course this was clarified by the description of the algorithm, but maybe the description could be clarified.

```
sage: G = SteenrodAlgebra(p=5, profile=[[2,1], [2,2,2]], basis='pst')
sage: H = SteenrodAlgebra(p=5, profile=[[2,1], [2,2,2]])
sage: [H[n].dimension() - G[n].dimension() for n in range(100)]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 4, 0]
```

* `.an_element()` sometimes returns an element which may not be in sub algebra:

```
sage: H = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[1,2,1,1])
sage: H.an_element()
Sq(2,1)
sage: H.an_element() in H
False
```

* For sub algebras, `.Q()` should throw an error for elements not in the sub algebra (as with `.P()`):

```
sage: H = SteenrodAlgebra(p=5, profile=[[2,1], [2,2,2]])
sage: H.Q(4) in H
False
sage: H.Q(4)
Q_4
sage: H.Q(4).parent() is H
True
```

* There is a problem with `.antipode()` for sub algebras:

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: A.Sq(2,1).antipode()
Sq(2,1)
sage: H = SteenrodAlgebra(profile=[2,2,1])
sage: H.Sq(2,1).antipode()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Element does not lie in this Steenrod algebra
```

* problems with coercion:

```
sage: H.Sq(2,1) == A.Sq(2,1)
True
sage: H.Sq(2,1).coproduct() == A.Sq(2,1).coproduct()
False

sage: A.Sq(2,1).coproduct().parent() is A.tensor_square()
sage: A.tensor_square()(H.Sq(2,1).coproduct())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

* printing of elements:  to be consistent with the rest of sage, perhaps multiplication should print as `*`:

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(13)
sage: A.an_element()
12 Q_1 Q_3 P(2,1)

sage: PolynomialRing(GF(13),'x',5).random_element()
5*x1^2 + x0*x2 + x2*x4 - x4^2 - 5*x2
```

* it's too bad that elements do not print in a way that can be typed directly into Sage (I think I read somewhere that this should be done whenever possible).  This could be fixed by allowing the user to declare Sq, P, Q as global functions (e.g. P = A.P) -- perhaps by using the .inject_variables() function -- and changing the Q_i to print as Q(i).  Of course this would work for only one Steenrod algebra (or sub algebra) at a time, but would still be useful for basic testing/playing.

Replying to [comment:8 niles]:

Thanks a lot for all the work and careful comments.  Among other things, you've found some bugs in the code, which I think I've fixed.  I'm attaching a new patch, but I'm leaving it as "needs work" while I keep looking at it to see if I can see other issues which need fixing.

That's a good idea; I've implemented it.

I don't see these, on either sage.math or on OS X.  What platform are you using?

Done, and also in milnor_multiplication().

Me, too.  It should give vector spaces of the same dimension regardless of the basis.

I don't see this one, although it may have been fixed by one of the other fixes.  I've added a doctest for it anyway.

I don't know how to fix this: it has to do with the implementation (or lack thereof) of tensor products.  I don't think it's particular to the Steenrod algebra, so I'd like to have it dealt with on another ticket.

I understand what you're saying, but I think that printing this way is ugly.  (This was one of the reasons for #9370.)  If you really want, I can change it, but I'd rather not.

This is a very interesting idea, but I don't know how to do it right now.  Can `inject_variables` be used to define functions, not just variables?  I'll think about it, but I may want to defer it to a later ticket.

(This was one of the reasons for #9370.)  If you really want, I can change it, but I'd rather not.\n\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this is a decision that should depend solely on my opinion or yours; my thinking is that we should opt for consistency over aesthetics unless there is a really good reason not to.  Every other ring in Sage prints multiplication as `*` -- do you have a good reason to reverse that convention for the Steenrod algebra? (As you point out, this is related to the question of whether or not #9370 is a good idea -- something I'm not sure of yet.) In particular, printing `*` is consistent with the way Sage requires input to be typed (although note my further comments on that topic below).\n\n\n> \n> >  * it's too bad that elements do not print in a way that can be typed directly into Sage (I think I read somewhere that this should be done whenever possible).  \n\n\nAfter some looking, I think what I was remembering is this section of the [interactive shell tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/interactive_shell.html#saving-and-loading-individual-objects), which mentions this idea as a possible way for printing objects, but one which Sage does not enforce -- rather it suggests using un/pickling to store and retrieve objects.  Nevertheless, I think printing as closely as possible to valid input is useful, especially for new users.\n\n> Can `inject_variables` be used to define functions, not just variables?  I'll think about it, but I may want to defer it to a later ticket.\n\n\nFair enough; something like this does work for [infinite polynomial rings](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.html):\n\n```\nsage: R = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ,'t')\nsage: R\nInfinite polynomial ring in t over Integer Ring\nsage: R.inject_variables()\nDefining t\nsage: R.gens()\n(t_*,)\nsage: t[2]\nt_2\nsage: t[3]\nt_3\nsage: t[2]*t[3] - 4*t[11] + 8\n-4*t_11 + t_3*t_2 + 8\nsage: t[2]*t[3] - 4*t[11] + 8 in R\nTrue\n```\n\nI think the way this is implemented is by defining a `__getitem__` method for the generator, but the same should work by defining a `__call__` method.  (And I did notice, by the way, that the objects don't print in the same way that they have to be input.)  For infinite polynomial rings, `.inject_variables()` is inherited from `sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject`:\n\n```\n    def inject_variables(self, scope=None, verbose=True):\n        \"\"\"\n        Inject the generators of self with their names into the\n        namespace of the Python code from which this function is\n        called.  Thus, e.g., if the generators of self are labeled\n        'a', 'b', and 'c', then after calling this method the\n        variables a, b, and c in the current scope will be set\n        equal to the generators of self.\n\n        NOTE: If Foo is a constructor for a Sage object with generators, and\n        Foo is defined in Cython, then it would typically call\n        ``inject_variables()`` on the object it creates.  E.g.,\n        ``PolynomialRing(QQ, 'y')`` does this so that the variable y is the\n        generator of the polynomial ring.\n        \"\"\"\n        vs = self.variable_names()\n        gs = self.gens()\n        if scope is None:\n           scope = globals()\n        if verbose:\n           print \"Defining %s\"%(', '.join(vs))\n        for v, g in zip(vs, gs):\n           scope[v] = g\n```\n\nSo if you want to use it, you would have to re-think what is returned by `.gens()`, especially in the case of finitely-generated sub algebras.  Of course you could make a new definition of `.inject_variables()`, but it's not clear this is a good idea either . . .

Glad to help; I'll keep looking too.  For now, some continued discussion of printing and `.inject_variables()` . . .

I'm using OS X, but Sage 4.5.2 for the first round of reviewing -- maybe recent changes have fixed these problems.

That sounds reasonable -- I'll try to work out the issue and put up a ticket (unless you already know what the problem is).

Well, I'm not sure if this is a decision that should depend solely on my opinion or yours; my thinking is that we should opt for consistency over aesthetics unless there is a really good reason not to.  Every other ring in Sage prints multiplication as `*` -- do you have a good reason to reverse that convention for the Steenrod algebra? (As you point out, this is related to the question of whether or not #9370 is a good idea -- something I'm not sure of yet.) In particular, printing `*` is consistent with the way Sage requires input to be typed (although note my further comments on that topic below).


> 
> >  * it's too bad that elements do not print in a way that can be typed directly into Sage (I think I read somewhere that this should be done whenever possible).  


After some looking, I think what I was remembering is this section of the [interactive shell tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/interactive_shell.html#saving-and-loading-individual-objects), which mentions this idea as a possible way for printing objects, but one which Sage does not enforce -- rather it suggests using un/pickling to store and retrieve objects.  Nevertheless, I think printing as closely as possible to valid input is useful, especially for new users.

> Can `inject_variables` be used to define functions, not just variables?  I'll think about it, but I may want to defer it to a later ticket.


Fair enough; something like this does work for [infinite polynomial rings](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.html):

```
sage: R = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ,'t')
sage: R
Infinite polynomial ring in t over Integer Ring
sage: R.inject_variables()
Defining t
sage: R.gens()
(t_*,)
sage: t[2]
t_2
sage: t[3]
t_3
sage: t[2]*t[3] - 4*t[11] + 8
-4*t_11 + t_3*t_2 + 8
sage: t[2]*t[3] - 4*t[11] + 8 in R
True
```

I think the way this is implemented is by defining a `__getitem__` method for the generator, but the same should work by defining a `__call__` method.  (And I did notice, by the way, that the objects don't print in the same way that they have to be input.)  For infinite polynomial rings, `.inject_variables()` is inherited from `sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject`:

```
    def inject_variables(self, scope=None, verbose=True):
        """
        Inject the generators of self with their names into the
        namespace of the Python code from which this function is
        called.  Thus, e.g., if the generators of self are labeled
        'a', 'b', and 'c', then after calling this method the
        variables a, b, and c in the current scope will be set
        equal to the generators of self.

        NOTE: If Foo is a constructor for a Sage object with generators, and
        Foo is defined in Cython, then it would typically call
        ``inject_variables()`` on the object it creates.  E.g.,
        ``PolynomialRing(QQ, 'y')`` does this so that the variable y is the
        generator of the polynomial ring.
        """
        vs = self.variable_names()
        gs = self.gens()
        if scope is None:
           scope = globals()
        if verbose:
           print "Defining %s"%(', '.join(vs))
        for v, g in zip(vs, gs):
           scope[v] = g
```

So if you want to use it, you would have to re-think what is returned by `.gens()`, especially in the case of finitely-generated sub algebras.  Of course you could make a new definition of `.inject_variables()`, but it's not clear this is a good idea either . . . I think this is worth a little more thought, but shouldn't derail the rest of this ticket.

I'm ready to give this a positive review, but now (Sage 4.6.2) I'm getting a failing doctest with `latex` on a coproduct (note the missing `1` at the end of the latex string):

```
sage: A7 = SteenrodAlgebra(7)
sage: c = Sq(2).change_basis('adem').coproduct()
sage: c
1 # Sq^2 + Sq^1 # Sq^1 + Sq^2 # 1
sage: latex(c)
1 \otimes \text{Sq}^{2} + \text{Sq}^{1} \otimes \text{Sq}^{1} + \text{Sq}^{2} \otimes 
```

This is probably related to bugs in the code for tensor products of algebras, but I haven't been able to track down the precise problem.
