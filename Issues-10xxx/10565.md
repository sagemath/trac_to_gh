This was reported by Alexandre Casamayou:

```
sage: var('n')
n
sage: assume(x<0)
sage: sum (x^n/(2*n+1), n, 0, infinity)
arctanh(sqrt(x))/sqrt(x)
```
In the last result `x` should be `-x` since x is negative.
This is what we get if we replace `x` by `-y`:

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: assume(y>0)
sage: sum ((-y)^n/(2*n+1), n, 0, infinity)
arctan(sqrt(y))/sqrt(y)
```

I retract this, since the formula with `sqrt(x)` is in fact valid over the complex numbers,
moreover the formula with `sqrt(-x)` is wrong (consider `x=-0.9` as example).
