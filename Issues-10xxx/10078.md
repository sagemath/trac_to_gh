Sage coding convention encourages to use ".. WARNING::" rather than ".. warning::", however, using search_src shows the converse is done :

```
sage: len(search_src(".. warning::", interact=False).splitlines())
209
sage: len(search_src(".. WARNING::", interact=False).splitlines())
34
```

Keywords: **documentation**
