Sage coding convention encourages to use ".. WARNING::" rather than ".. warning::", however, using search_src shows the converse is done :

```
sage: len(search_src(".. warning::", interact=False).splitlines())
209
sage: len(search_src(".. WARNING::", interact=False).splitlines())
34
```

I guess we could just have ".. examples::" print "EXAMPLES:", and similarly for ".. tests::" and that would be the end of it.  On the other hand, if we could actually have these directives include all of the examples and interspersed text, then we could, for example, decide to omit the tests by passing a command-line option when building the docs.  But I don't know how directives work well enough to know if this could be implemented in an easy-to-use way.

See the [sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_directive) and [docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/rst-directives.html) docs for information on creating directives.  I haven't looked at these in any detail.
