This ticket aims to provide a way to test interrupts and the `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` mechanism.

This also patches `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-doctest` to check that all doctests have a balanced `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` count.

Patch chain: #9678, #10061, #10258, **#10030**, #10018, #9640

**CC:**  @nexttime @wjp

**Keywords:** interrupt signal doctest

**Author:** Jeroen Demeyer

**Reviewer:** Volker Braun

**Merged:** sage-4.7.alpha1

On OS X, I get doctest "failures"::

```

```

It looks to me that the "Got" text matches the "Expected" text, so why is this a failure?

I think the issue is that "``...``" expects to match something but does not match the empty line ``<BLANKLINE>``. Note the difference between 
* Linux: will print stack backtrace before "Unhandled SIGABRT", and
* OSX: does not print stack backtrace.

For example, changing

```
sage: print '---'; print Popen(['sage', '-c', cmd], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE).communicate()[1]  # long time
```
to 

```
sage: print '---'; print 'backtrace:'; print Popen(['sage', '-c', cmd], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE).communicate()[1]  # long time
```
fixes the doctest on OSX, as now at least ``'backtrace:'`` gets matched by the "``...``".
