I would like to use the fraction field of infinite polynomial ring.

```
sage: P.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ, implementation='sparse')
sage: z=P(x[1])
sage: 1/z
```

So far, one gets

```
NotImplementedError: Fraction Fields of Infinite Polynomial Rings are not implemented
```

This seems to be a coercion problem.

The main problem comes from the gcd :

sage: R.<x>=InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p1=x[0]+x[0]**2
sage: p1.gcd(p1)

I think this is the right way since the `gcd` needed an implementation. However I have a few comments:

- Could you add some tests showing that you get something in the fraction field?
- Now we don't need the `# indirect doctest` for any method with a leading and trailing underscore.
- Are you pushing this off to 6.0 because of the large number of changes to the file? I don't think this is really touched often, so I don't expect there to be rebasing problems and we should try to get this into sage-5.12 IMO.

Best,

Hello again,

Thanks for looking at my code. Here is an updated patch.

* I have removed the "#indirect doctests" in _div_
* I have added two .parent() tests in _div_
* I have set back the milestone to 5.12 (I have no good reason to postpone)
