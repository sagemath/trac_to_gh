Currently, modules in Sage are based on the old coercion model and do not cooperate well with the category framework.  This ticket updates almost all module classes to the use new coercion model and the category framework.

Moreover, some coercions go wrong:

```
sage: V3 = QQ^3
sage: M = V3 / [[1,2,3]]
sage: V2 = QQ^2
sage: N = V3 / [[1,1,1]]
# The quotient maps are of course coercions
sage: f3M = M.coerce_map_from(V3)
sage: f3N = N.coerce_map_from(V3)
# The following is a bug...
sage: V2.has_coerce_map_from(N)
True
sage: M.has_coerce_map_from(V2)
True
sage: N.has_coerce_map_from(V2)
True
#... because the composition of coercion
# from N to V2 to M should be a coercion,
# but it isn't:
sage: M.has_coerce_map_from(N)
False
# Moreover, we obtain a non-commuting triangle of
# coercions:
sage: fM2 = V2.coerce_map_from(M)
sage: fN2 = V2.coerce_map_from(N)
sage: [fM2(f3M(x)) for x in V3.basis()]
[(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1/3, -2/3)]
sage: [fN2(f3N(x)) for x in V3.basis()]
[(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, -1)]
```

Comparison goes wrong as well:

```
sage: V2==M
True
sage: M==V2
False
```

In the above examples, this ticket removes the coercion between abstract module `V^2` and the quotient modules, and makes sure that `V2!=M`.

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The following tests failed: _test_pickling
```
This is due to the cached `echelonized_basis_matrix` behaving badly under pickling:

```
sage: K.<x> = FractionField(QQ['x'])
sage: M = K^3
sage: W = M.span_of_basis([[1, 1, x]])
sage: W.echelonized_basis_matrix()
[1 1 x]
sage: s = dumps(W)
sage: V = loads(s)
sage: V.echelonized_basis_matrix()
[1, 1, x]
sage: type(_)
<type 'list'>
```
There does not seem to be any such problem with `basis_matrix()`:

```
sage: W.basis_matrix()
[1 1 x]
sage: V.basis_matrix()
[1 1 x]
```

Did you open tickets for these?

And in a couple of changes to `src/sage/geometry/cone.py` you modify code not to use `_ in _` as ther is no coercion defined.
Any ticket opened to implement such a coercion?

I just created #17543 and #17544.  (See[comment:11](#comment%3A11) for `LinearCode`.)

I'm not sure if this is desired; the absence of these particular maps may have been an (unintended) consequence of implementing the new coercion model in the simplest possible way, but it may have been intentional as well, I don't remember.

I was asking because it used to be possible to use the `in` keyword when the classes were using the old coercion model.

After looking at this again, I think the reason was as follows: a cone *C* is a certain type of subset of a vector space *V*, and *C* contains a largest maximal linear subspace *S*.  Now to test if an element *x* of *C* is in *S*, the coercion framework checks if *S*(*x*) == *x*, but when trying to comparing these two elements it cannot find a common parent for the toric lattice and the linear subspace.  This seems to be because of the following method in `ToricLattice_generic`:

```python
# We need to override this function, otherwise e.g. the sum of elements of
# different lattices of the same dimension will live in ZZ^n.
def construction(self):
    r"""
    Return the functorial construction of ``self``.

    OUTPUT:

    - ``None``, we do not think of toric lattices as constructed from
      simpler objects since we do not want to perform arithmetic involving
      different lattices.

    [...]
    """
    return None
```
The reason why it used to work with the old coercion model might have been a peculiarity of some `_coerce_impl()` method.  Trying to fix this (so that we can use `... in ...` again) will probably lead to all kind of other problems, so I'd prefer not to do that on this ticket.

Indeed, the category of `GF(p)` is a join of three categories:

```
sage: GF(3).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
```
Maybe parts of the category code (like `join`) should be transformed into Cython to make it faster?

<a id='comment:49'></a>With the new commits, the category of free modules is `FreeModules(base_ring.category())` by default, and instead of taking the join with `FiniteEnumeratedSets` (if applicable), we add a `list()` method.

There are two doctest failures:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 43.7 src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 43.7 src/sage/modules/free_module.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
The first is caused by #11126; the second is a `NotImplementedError` in `repr()` caused by the fact that `basis()` is not implemented for abstract free modules.

In the case of finite fields, there is *no* variation in what the category is: this thing can be created up front (to accommodate GF(2), which is always present if I'm not mistaken), and just be set to be the category. The current problem is that the joining of categories happens in some of the more generic construction routines. We'd need a way of signalling that we want to shortcut that (a precise_category keyword that percolates up perhaps?). That's an optimization strategy that may have more pay-off for this particular scenario than making \"join\" faster (which might still be worthwhile to do). In any case, that's for another ticket. Also: premature optimization etc. Thanks for looking into this.",

That's one option, but ultimately taking joins is a a rather dynamic operation that needs to investigate quite a bit of the category graph in order to ensure it's safe to use what's cached (can the result of a join depend on changes elsewhere in the graph?). In the case of finite fields, there is *no* variation in what the category is: this thing can be created up front (to accommodate GF(2), which is always present if I'm not mistaken), and just be set to be the category. The current problem is that the joining of categories happens in some of the more generic construction routines. We'd need a way of signalling that we want to shortcut that (a precise_category keyword that percolates up perhaps?). That's an optimization strategy that may have more pay-off for this particular scenario than making "join" faster (which might still be worthwhile to do). In any case, that's for another ticket. Also: premature optimization etc. Thanks for looking into this.
