Perhaps we could clarify the dependencies; the web page just says Python and setuptools (or distribute).

Also, `spkg/standard/deps` lacks an explicit dependency on these, instead lists Pygments:

```make
$(INST)/$(JINJA2): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(PYGMENTS) $(INST)/$(PATCH)
	$(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(JINJA2) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(JINJA2).log"
```
There's also:

```make
# For reference and for when the setuptools problem is solved, here
# are the actual dependencies:
#
# sagenb: python pexpect twisted jinja2 sphinx docutils setuptools
# sqlalchemy: python setuptools
# sphinx: docutils jinja2 pygments
# jinja2: python docutils setuptools
# pygments: python setuptools
# twisted: python python_gnutls setuptools
# zodb: python setuptools
```

The p0 was intentional, as IMHO *every* Sage package should have a "patch" level, be it zero for the first spkg in a new upstream series, to avoid confusion with (vanilla) upstream tarballs and packages.

(I'm not sure if everybody knows one can often simply change the extension of an upstream tarball and [try to] install it *as is* into Sage, with the usual Sage commands.)

Almost every distribution prepends its own versioning to package names.



 
> If somebody can review my changes, positive_review.

Really minor, no operational effect, so **positive review** for those changes.

P.S.: Fortunately(?) `sage-spkg` does `chmod +x`, otherwise I would have noticed that myself. ;-)

Upstream tarballs and packages don't have an `.spkg` extension, so I don't think there is much confusion possible.

About the naming: it seems there are no rules for this.  I would personally always add a patch level if the package contains patches, no patch level otherwise (as is the case with Jinja2).

An `.spkg` is essentially the same as a `.tar`, `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`, so the extension doesn't really matter, except that for dealing with an `.spkg` you have to modify filename completion.

So a "real" spkg, with `src/`, `SPKG.txt` and `spkg-install` etc. should have a different basename, which should be the upstream name (unfortunately not always the case) plus Sage's addendum, `.pX`, to distinguish its *content* / structure.

As said above, you can also directly install some vanilla upstream packages if you only change the extension (from e.g. `.tar.bz2` to `.spkg`); these should clearly be distinguishable by lacking a Sage "patch level". (You can of course also rename spkgs to `.tar.bz2` or create links just to make handling them easier. ;-) )

This is an endless discussion (some even say there shouldn't be p0's, but only p1's and up).

IMHO we should use p0 for the first package (new or upgraded to a newer upstream version) if there are no actual patches to upstream source code, p1 otherwise, i.e. if we still have to apply patches though upstream is fresh. (Some even start without a patch level despite we patch upstream.)

"Downgrading" the patch level, or keeping it for a long time though there have been many changes during the review process is the worst thing. I don't know how many x.y.z.pK**.oldN** spkgs I have. At least posting the new md5sum gets common now.
