```
warning: /usr/local/src/sage-debug/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx:68:21: Function signature does not match previous declaration
```
because `stdsage.pxi` is not included properly (there are comments indicating trouble with `stdsage.pxi` but in sage-4.6.alpha2 I could not find any problems).
