This is a new graph generator to create a random triangulation, i.e., a random planar graph all of whose faces are triangles (3-cycles). We do this by generation points iid uniformly on the surface of a sphere, finding the convex hull of those points, and returning the 1-skeleton of that polyhedron.

There might be numerical issues with the convex hull here, so we by default work over `QQ`

Dear Ed,

Nice.  I needed this for a course, so I rebased it against 4.8.alpha6.  Only the author credit was failing, so it was a trivial fix.

How much work would it be to get layout information from the locations on the sphere?  I would think a projection onto the plane might be better than what a planar layout currently provides and would be simpler computationally.  Could you easily locate the "largest" face to be the exterior?

I'll try to stick with this for a review - I'd like to see it in Sage.

Thanks,
Rob

Dear Ed,

> Is there something I need to do to keep this moving?


Yes, I noticed it had been dormant for a while.  My students here at AIMS have been using this the past few days, so I could probably give it a positive review right now.  But it seems silly not to provide a layout (or a planar embedding) when it seems that all that information could be obtained from what is already computed.  In other words, it should be relatively easy to improve on 

```
G = graphs.RandomTriangulation(40)
G.plot(layout='planar')
```

both in execution time and visual quality.  Maybe an embedding is already available from the 1-skeleton or something.  I am happy to pursue contributing code for the layout if you are not interested, or I could review something you would add.  Whatever is your pleasure.

So not really anything official to do to move this along at the moment.  I'm suggesting the improvement of adding a layout (with code from either of us) and would like to work this through to a positive review.

Hi Rob,

I thought about this some more. Your comments make perfect sense. The `RandomTriangulation` method can edited to provide an embedding by stereographically projecting the vertices of the polytope into the plane. But I fear that this would give pictures that are mathematically correct but visually awful. I can sketch out the method offline if you like. 

What Sage really needs (and I'm not knowledgeable enough to do this) is a really good planar graph layout algorithm. Compare:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
g.show()
```
to

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
g.plot(layout='planar')
```

If you think adding the stereographic projection embedding is worthwhile, I'd be happy to have you add it to this method. (I found creating patches and the like to be non-intuitive ... I'm willing to work on the code, but then have you upload it to this site :-)

Best,
Ed

I think a graph can carry an embedding, as a logical construction - the neighbors of a vertex as an ordered list, we ought to capture that at a minimum.  (Need to double-check on that.)  Then if a general layout algorithm can utilize that information, the visual appeal might improve in the future.  But I would like to see if the actual coordinates from the stereographic projection are useful as well.

Hellooooo,

I just looked at this code, and I thank you very very much for reminding me that the normal distribution was invariant by rotation. I had totally forgotten this, and it is soooo elegant to be able to sample sphere point uniformly this easily  `;-)`

I added a small commit at public/10276 which does no non-trivial things. If you do not see anything wrong with it, you can change the ticket's status to `positive_review`.

Thankssssss,
