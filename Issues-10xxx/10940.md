<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This adds a new interface (based on maple.py) to the 
giac library:

http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html

This library, in the form of the graphical interface 
xcas, is widely used in the France competitive exams 
for high school teachers, hence widely tested.

The new interface is fully documented, more examples 
of usage are found here:

http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~han/exemples-giac%20--%20Sage.html

I identified one error in preparing the patch: 'giac'
needs to be added to interfaces at the end of all.py.

A simple pre-parsing would improve the interface:

sage: s = """
my_mod(a,b) := {
    return irem(a,b)
}
"""

sage: giac(s)

<error>

However, reducing to one line works:

sage: giac(s.replace("\n",""))
 (a,b)->{ 
  return(irem(a,b));  
}

sage: giac("my_mod(103,101)")

2

or similarly one can insert \'s:

sage: giac(s.replace("\n","\\"))
 (a,b)->{ 
  return(irem(a,b));  
}

sage: giac("my_mod(103,101)")

2

Caution: I don't know if the giac 
parser always ignores "\n", and in 
the second replacement some more 
care is needed to avoid replacing 
"\\\n" with "\\\\".

The example given on the above site is:

%giac
f:=(a,b)-> if (a<b)  \
             then  x[a,b];   \
             else    if (a>b) \
                      then  -x[b,a]; \
                      else   0;  \
                     fi;\
             fi;

Given that giac uses ";" to terminate lines, 
a better pre-parsing would render the \'s 
unnecessary, as is the case for the xcas 
interpretter.

It should be noted that conversions back to 
Sage are limited.  As far as I can tell only 
automatic string evaluations succeed (but 
errors are trapped and this is documented).

Finally, the author notes that an interrupt 
in Sage can kill the giac session.

Extending conversions to Sage and handling 
interrupts better are larger projects which
could be done later.  Rebuilding the diff 
to recover the %giac magic feature and some 
slight pre-parsing would be desirable to 
complete this interface.

The two diffs (sagegiac.diff then sagegiac_addons1.diff) install and 
build cleanly against sage-4.7.1, provides a useful new interface 
(to the symbolic and arithmetic library giac), is well-documented and 
clean.
