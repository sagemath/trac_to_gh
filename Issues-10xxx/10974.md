This patch overhauls, consolidates, fixes and expands matrix augmentation and stacking.

Fixes:
* subdivisions of matrices are generally not preserved under these operations, but now are

Features:
* a vector may now be supplied as a second argument across all routines

Consolidation:
* there is some standardization of variable names and techniques across the routines

Expansion:
* augment() for dense integer matrices is uncommented and working now

Documentation:
* new features (vector argument, subdivisions) have been documented where added
* a general upgrade in documentation would be valuable, on another ticket

To Do:
* work to have result formed over a common ring

"general" patch adds vector argument and subdivision support to the generic `stack()` method.  Subdivision management is split out as helper methods for use with routines in the "special" patch.

"special" patch works on routines for dense integer matrices, mod 2 matrices, and generic sparse matrices.  It also moves the generic matrix `augment()`  to a better location in the source (it was left in place so changes could be seen more readily on the "general" patch).
