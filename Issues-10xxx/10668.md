Before this ticket, Hom was implemented as a covariant functorial construction:

```
    sage: Rings().hom_category()
    Category of hom sets in Category of rings
    sage: Rings().hom_category().super_categories()
    [Category of hom sets in Category of sets]
```

The intention was to model the fact that a morphism in a category is
also a morphism in any super category, via the forgetful functor. With
the example above, if A and B are rings, then a ring morphism phi:
A->B is also a set morphism. However, at the level of parents, and as
noted in the documentation of sage.category.HomCategory, this is
mathematically plain wrong: if A and B are rings, then Hom(A,B) in the
category of rings does not coincide with Hom(A,B) in the category of
sets.

I, Nicolas, take full blame for this misfeature; it was just the
shortest route to implement some urgently needed features about
morphisms, and still get that huge chunk of category code done.

Status of the current reimplementation:

- Add support for a MorphismsMethods subclass, similar to
  ElementMethods and ParentMethods. If Cat is a category, then
  Cat.MorphismMethods will provide generic methods for morphisms in
  Cat and in any subcategory. This can be achieved by:

   - Building of a hierarchy of abstract classes Cat.morphism_class,
     similar to Cat.element_class and Cat.parent_class (10 lines of
     code; see Category.element_class).

   - Having morphisms in Cat inherit from `Cat.morphism_class`; this
     is implemented by overriding `Parent.morphism_class`. An
     alternative would have been to override `Category.element_class`
     in `HomsetsCategory.element_class`.

- Rename both HomCategory and hom_category to Homsets, for consistency
  with the other constructions like CartesianProducts, ...

- Fix HomCategory: for Cat a category, the purpose of
  Cat.hom_category() shall be to provide mathematical information
  about its homsets (e.g. that a homset in the category of vector
  spaces is also a vector space). It is only a subcategory of the
  homsets of the full super categories of Cat (a homset in the
  category of finite groups is also a homset in the category of
  groups).

- Remove HomCategory from the global namespace.

Potential further desirable features for a later ticket:

- If CatA is a subcategory of CatB, add automatic coercion (or just
  conversion?) from Hom(A,B, CatA) to Hom(A, B, CatB), modeling the
  appropriate forgetful functor. There are too many such coercions
  for them to be registered explicitly. So this probably needs to be
  implemented through a specific CatB._has_coerce_map_from(A) for
  homsets.

- Extend/use sage.categories.pushout to handle mixed morphism
  arithmetic (e.g. having the sum of an algebra morphism and a
  coalgebra morphism return a vector space morphism).

I don't see why this should be wrong: Any ring homomorphism is a set homomorphism. Hence, `Hom_Rings()(A,B)` is a subset of `Hom_Sets()(A,B)`  --  nobody claims that they coincide.

You mean "Cat.HomMethods will provide...", I guess.

The approach with `HomMethods` would provide methods defined for homsets, whereas the fact that a homset of vector spaces is a vector space has implications for the methods of *elements* of the homsets (i.e., for methods of morphisms).

I don't know whether we need special methods for homset, but of course it would be nice to have homsets that are vector spaces.

What about the following approach:

* There is the base class `sage.categories.category.HomCategory`. I suggest to provide it with an optional argument `hom_structure`. Define, for example, `H = HomCategory(Algebras(QQ),hom_structure=VectorSpaces(QQ))`. Then, `H` is the category of homsets in the category of algebras over `QQ`, and each homset would automatically be a vector space over `QQ`. Moreover, `H` would be a sub-category of `VectorSpaces(QQ)`.

* I suggest to introduce a lazy attribute `C.hom_structure`, that defaults to `C.HomStructure` if that exists, and otherwise returns the join of `S.hom_structure` for all `S in C.super_categories()`. Then, `C.hom_category()` defaults to `HomCategory(C, hom_structure=C.hom_structure)`.

* Of course, any category can define a custom `HomStructure` (e.g., in the `__init__` method of `VectorSpaces(R)`, we would define `self.HomStructure=self`, ensuring that `self.hom_structure` is the right thing). In order to avoid an infinite recursion of the lazy attribute, we also need to define `Objects().HomStructure=Objects()`.

That would be a good candidate for your `HomMethods`, don't you think?

I guess that would be an extension of the `sage.categories.pushout` formalism.

Anyway, my suggestion is to start with the `hom_structure` approach, as it seems to be relatively straight forward to implement.

Very short answer for now: here the question is whether Hom_Rings()(A,B) is an object of Hom_Sets(). It's not. The point of VectorSpaces().HomCategory() is to encode mathematical information about the homsets, like the fact that Hom(A,B) is itself a vector space. We don't want this information to be applied to a homset of a subcategory (a homset in Algebras() being certainly not a vector space).

Right.

Nevertheless, I believe that an attribute like `C.hom_structure` would be a convenient way to declare that the homsets of `C` all have a particular structure (like `Rings()` or `VectorSpaces(C.base_ring())`) and that therefore `C.hom_category()` is a sub-category of `C.hom_structure`.

Not in a sub-category! Namely, if `Cat` is the category of F-vectorspaces, then `Cat.MorphismMethods` would include addition and skalar multiplication. But for a sub-category of `Cat`, such as F-algebras, we don't want that, as you had pointed out.

I don't see such hierarchy.

I really think the `Cat.hom_structure` formalism that I suggested would be easier. 

Any category would provide its own hom-structure (and there would be *no* inheritance for sub-categories), of course `Objects()` being the default hom-structure.

Then, homsets in `Cat` would inherit from `Cat.hom_structure.parent_class`, whereas morphisms in `Cat` would inherit from `Cat.hom_structure.element_class`.

In particular, there is no need to provide `Cat.HomMethods` or `Cat.MorphismMethods`. In fact, they are redundant: If you simply state that `Cat.hom_structure` is `VectorSpaces(QQ)`, then the morphisms already have the element methods of vector spaces, whereas in your approach you needed to restate (copy-and-paste) them as `Cat.MorphismMethods`.

Of course addition should not be put in MorphismMethods. On the other
hand, there are a lot of generic operations on morphisms that pass
down to subcategories, like inverting a morphism (say in the category
of finite sets) or computing the matrix/the rank/the det/you_name_it
of a morphism of finite dimensional vector space. It is essential to
pass those generic methods down to subcategories.

That is not a vague though that popped up when I created this ticket,
but a concrete feature that we have been longing for years and we
could not implement in MuPAD (MuPAD categories did not handle
morphisms) despite our many use cases.

And I think mine is no more complicated, while being more consistent
with the rest of the framework :-)

It seems like most of the discussion comes from confusion and
vagueness (and I take my share of the blame for that). So let's both
write a little prototype to have a concrete ground to discuss on. We
don't have to include the coercion / push_out part in this prototype
since we agree on it. I can try to implement mine sometime next week.

Cat.HomCategory() will still use the standard super_categories()
approach to state that it is a subcategory of VectorSpaces(), and its
elements will inherit from VectorSpaces().element_class.

Cheers,
				Nicolas

PS: by the way, I am wondering if we should be using Cat.objects() or
Cat.Objects() (given that we already have Cat.Quotients(),
Cat.Subobjects(), Cat.CartesianProducts(), ...). Here, I am thinking
about using the occasion to replace Cat.hom_category() by Cat.Homsets().

I see. Yes, for those kind of methods, your approach makes very much sense.

But what would actually prevent us from doing *both*? Our two approaches are good for different things, and they are orthogonal to each other. If I understand correctly, you suggest that there should be `Cat.morphism_class` from which morphisms inherit, analogous to `Cat.element_class`, thereby getting "hereditary" (to sub-categories) methods. I suggest that `Cat` should have an attribute that allows `Cat.hom_category()` to assign the correct category to the homset category (hence, `Cat.hom_category().is_subcategory(Cat.hom_structure)`), so that homomorphism would inherit from `Cat.hom_structure.element_class` (by the existing framework - hence, my suggestion is indeed very consistent with with the existing framework :-).

Is there any reason to not have a double inheritance from `Cat.morphism_class` and `Cat.hom_structure.element_class` (`Cat.hom_structure` being a category)?

OK, this is what I suggested above: One needs to introduce a standard mechanism to declare the category which `Cat.hom_category()` is sub-category of.

And that's a second misunderstanding: this mechanism already exists,
and I am not planning to remove it (though the syntax might change a
tiny bit; we probably don't need the extra_super_categories thingy,
and just use super_categories.

What do you think of using the occasion to rename Cat.hom_category()
into Cat.Homsets(), for consistency with Cat.Quotients() and the like?

What mechanism do you mean? I am of course aware of the `extra_super_category` method - but `sage.categories.category.HomCategory.extra_super_category()` returns `[]`, and `sage.categories.category.HomCategory.super_categories()` returns stuff that we don't want (namely `C.hom_category()` for all `C` in `self.base_category.super_categories()`).

Of course, it would suffice to make `VectorSpaces(QQ).hom_category().extra_super_categories()` return `[VectorSpaces(QQ)]`. But this would currently require to introduce a custom `HomCategory` class for `VectorSpaces` that overrides the method of the `HomCategory` base class. This is not nice and should be simplified.

What I plan is: Remove inheritance of the hom-categories of the super-categories of the base-category from `sage.categories.category.HomCategory.super_categories()`; it should basically return `self.extra_super_categories()+[Sets()]`. Moreover, define `sage.categories.category.HomCategory.extra_super_categories()` like this:

```
def extra_super_categories(self):
    try:
        return [self.base_category.hom_structure]
    except AttributeError:
        return []
```

Then, in the init-method of the category of vector spaces, one would simply add the line

```
        self.hom_structure = self
```

Similarly (I hope that I am not confusing things now), one would add the line

```
        self.hom_structure = LeftModules(self.base_ring())
```
to the init method of *right* modules; and `self.hom_structure = RightModules(self.base_ring())` for left modules, and so on. That seems easier than defining a whole class `HomCategory` for `LeftModules`.

Personally, I don't like uppercase method names, and I remember that it is officially recommended to avoid capital letters in Python method or function or module names, whereas upper case is recommended to use for classes (but I do not remember where I was reading that recommendation).

Simon

Sure, please take the easiest route for you! #10667 is already large enough, and I see the point of not introducing yet another dependency :-)

I just uploaded a preliminary patch, implementing my approach. The patch isn't finished (lacking doc tests), but is ready for discussion. It depends on #10667 (though it might apply with some noise without #10667 - test, if you like).

Features:

**__Structure of hom sets__**

As I announced, I introduced an attribute for categories `C` that determines a category which `C.hom_category()` is sub-category of. I call this attribute `C.hom_structure`:

```
# This was already fixed by #10667
sage: LeftModules(ZZ).hom_category()
Category of hom sets in Category of left modules over Integer Ring
sage: type(LeftModules(ZZ).hom_category())
<class 'sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.HomCategory'>
# This is new:
sage: LeftModules(ZZ).hom_category().is_subcategory(RightModules(ZZ))
True
sage: issubclass(LeftModules(ZZ).hom_category().parent_class, RightModules(ZZ).parent_class)
True
# Reason for it working:
sage: LeftModules(ZZ).hom_structure
Category of right modules over Integer Ring
```
The attribute `C.hom_structure` is used in `sage.categories.HomCategory.extra_super_categories()`.

**Hierarchy of hom-categories**

Recall that currently, the hierarchy of hom-categories goes parallel with the hierarchy of their base categories, which is wrong.

However, if `C1` is a *full* sub-category of `C2` then (and *only* then) we should indeed have `C1.hom_category().is_subcategory(C2.hom_category())`. Similar to the method `C.super_categories()`, I introduce an attribute `C.full_subcategory_of`, that provides a list of immediate super categories in which `C` is full.

With that, I have:

```
sage: IntegralDomains().full_subcategory_of
[Category of commutative rings, Category of domains]
sage: Domains().full_subcategory_of
[Category of rings]
sage: IntegralDomains().hom_category().is_subcategory(CommutativeRings().hom_category())
True
sage: IntegralDomains().hom_category().is_subcategory(Rings().hom_category())
True
```
and, in particular

```
sage: issubclass(IntegralDomains().hom_category().parent_class, Rings().hom_category().parent_class)
True
```

**Self-criticism**

It is not very pythonic to do those things with an attribute - usually, methods are better. However, an attribute is easier to add, and it is faster to access.

I am not sure whether I got the "full subcategory" business right in all cases.

Hi Simon!

I finally got to work on this. See:

http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/tip/category-hom_methods-nt.patch

It's just a proof of concept. The core of the patch implementing the
infrastructure is about 10 lines of code. The rest is (partially)
adapting the category code to make use of that infrastructure.  I
haven't run all tests, and there are a couple things failing here and
there, but it should be about correct. At least the tests of
modules_with_basis basically pass :-)

# About attributes for specifying homset structures / full sub categories

I much prefer to use methods instead:

- This is consistent with what has been done so far (with
  the method super_categories, ...)

- It is easier for a subclass to override

- It's only a tiny bit more verbose, since anyway one should write a
  doctest for it, and since most categories do not have an __init__.


# About full subcategories

I totally agree that we want this concept. I am not sure yet about the
syntax though. In the draft, I have implemented a separate method
"full_super_categories". However most of the time, this is quite
redundant with the super_categories method. So I'd rather have instead
the method super_categories include the information in its result. An
option would be to use something like:

    def super_categories(self):
        return [ (Semigroups(), "full"), Monoids() ]

Then full_super_categories and all_super_categories, ... would extract
the relevant information from the above.

We could be more fancy to avoid breaking backward compatibility:

    def super_categories(self):
        return annotated_list( [ (Semigroups(), "full"), Monoids() ])

where annotated_list would be a helper class whose instances would
behave like usual lists, except that one could query annotations on
their elements, as in:

	"full" in l.annotations(Semigroups())


# Things that still need discussion

- Do we want all morphisms, and in particular SetMorphism's to
  systematically inherit from categories (that wasn't the case yet)

- How should categories specify the class to use for their homsets?
  This currently is done in a couple spots by having
  C.HomCategory.ParentMethods inherit from some specific homset. But
  that's quite hugly (ParentMethods is supposed to be an abstract
  class with just generic methods). Or maybe, that won't be needed
  anymore once things will be cleaned up: there will be a single
  concrete Homset class, and all the rest will be provided by the
  categories?

- Where should the constructors for the various types of morphisms be
  stored? In C.MorphismMethods? In C.ParentMethods (like is currently
  done with module_morphism)? Elsewhere?

- super_categories and friends should probably return tuples instead
  of lists. That's safer, especially since their results are cached.

- We probably want to move HomCategory in its own file

- Do we want to keep C.hom_category() or use C.Homsets() instead, for
  consistency with C.CartesianProducts() and such.

Cheers,
				Nicolas

Each category should have a `Homset` attribute specifying which
concrete class to use for its homset. The default value for that
attribute (implemented as a lazy attribute) is too pickup the first
non default Homset attribute in the list of full_super_categories(),
or sage.category.homset.Homset if there is none.

>  - Where should the constructors for the various types of morphisms be
>    stored? In C.MorphismMethods? In C.ParentMethods (like is currently

For `A` a parent, `A.hom(on_basis = [data],...)` would call
`A.morphism_on_basis(data,...)`. This `morphism_on_basis` could
typically be implemented in `A`, or in `C.ParentMethods` for `C` the
category of `A`.

There are 5-6 explicit hom functions in Sage that would need to be
generalized to accept this syntax, while keeping backward
compatibility if no keyword is specified.

>  - super_categories and friends should probably return tuples instead

The new `_super_categories` lazy attribute should be a tuple. In the
long run, all_super_categories and friends would best return tuples
for safety (especially since they are cached). Probably
super_categories as well. It would be good to allow soon
super_categories to return a tuple. However this might induce speed
regression in the C3 implementation.

>  - We probably want to move HomCategory in its own file


+1

That would make sense. Comments anyone?

Little inconvenient: possible confusion between `C.Homset` (the
concrete class to be used for homsets in this category) and
`C.Homsets()` (the category of homsets in this category).

When X is a quotient field, we can build a morphism from X to Y by

The source of confusion is that the first entry above should have read
as "Category of endsets". I just fixed that (a trivial thing in
_repr_) and will push shortly.

Now I have::

```
sage: Posets().Endsets().super_categories()
[Category of endsets, Category of homsets of posets]
```

An it's normal that monoids don't show up above because they are a
super category of the category of endsets. Just as a double check:

```
sage: Posets().Endsets().is_subcategory(Monoids())
True
sage: Posets().Homsets().Endset().is_subcategory(Monoids())
True
```

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas
