A typo in the function `delta_qexp` in `vm_basis.py` means that an if statement which is supposed to speed things up over `ZZ` or `QQ` never gets it right.

Trivial patch coming up.

See the attached patch.  I don't think the fix can be doctested, but here are some timings on `sage-4.6.1.alpha0`:

BEFORE THE PATCH:

```
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 431 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(10000)')
25 loops, best of 3: 35.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(1000000)')
5 loops, best of 3: 6.42 s per loop
```

AFTER THE PATCH:

```
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 304 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(10000)')
25 loops, best of 3: 28.9 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(1000000)')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.73 s per loop
```

That's right, apart from timings there is no "visible" difference. All tests pass, so I would give this a positive review. Do you want to change anything before?
