I think that's what the patch is all about. I applied it to 4.6.2.alpha4 and it happily built and sage -testall did not show any problems for me. But may be the following warnings should be addressed

```
warning: sage/combinat/combinat_cython.pyx:14:0: 'stdlib' is deprecated, use 'libc.stdlib'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pyx:7:0: 'python_int' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pyx:8:0: 'python_float' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_py.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rr.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_el.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
```
And possibly

```
warning: sage/modular/modsym/p1list.pyx:703:17: cdef variable 'i' declared after it is used
```
Finally I am wondering about these

```
warning: sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx:53:22: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: sage/matrix/matrix_window.pyx:9:17: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: sage/matrix/matrix_sparse.pyx:18:33: Function signature does not match previous declaration
```
But all these were present before upgrading to cython-0.14.1.
We could use the opportunity to fix some of them before they bite us later, especially the deprecated ones.

As for commenting out the deprecation warning, the issue is that decorators aren't implemented for Cython special functions. They used to be silently ignored, but now an error is raised. When they're supported, we should put this back in.
