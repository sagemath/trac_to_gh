I think that's what the patch is all about. I applied it to 4.6.2.alpha4 and it happily built and sage -testall did not show any problems for me. But may be the following warnings should be addressed

```
warning: sage/combinat/combinat_cython.pyx:14:0: 'stdlib' is deprecated, use 'libc.stdlib'
warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'

warning: sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_el.pxd:3:0: 'python_object' is deprecated, use 'cpython'
```
And possibly

```
warning: sage/modular/modsym/p1list.pyx:703:17: cdef variable 'i' declared after it is used
```
Finally I am wondering about these

```
warning: sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx:53:22: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: sage/matrix/matrix_window.pyx:9:17: Function signature does not match previous declaration
warning: sage/matrix/matrix_sparse.pyx:18:33: Function signature does not match previous declaration
```
But all these were present before upgrading to cython-0.14.1.
We could use the opportunity to fix some of them before they bite us later, especially the deprecated ones.
