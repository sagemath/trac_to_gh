This ticket is part of 
#10165: Spanish translation of the tutorial

I open this ticket to inform everybody that I'm translating some sections of the tutorial:

A Guided Tour
* Basic Rings
* Linear Algebra
* Polynomials
* Finite Groups, Abelian Groups
* Number Theory

Part of this is already done. I will upload a single patch with all five sections when it's done.

Rationale is: One ticket per section means too many tickets. These sections are all related in content (Basic Algebra), and the five of them can be read in reasonable time by a reviewer.

Followup is #17335

Note: I included only the five rst files corresponding to the translated sections. I leave it to patch 10165 to make up the index. Compile the docs with:

`./sage -docbuild es/tutorial html`

In order to compile, you need to take the following steps, which must be done in 10165 anyway:

* Add 'es' to line nr. 17 of "SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py":

LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr'] 

* Add a conf.py and a index.rst to the es/tutorial directory (which you can copy from en/tutorial)

Please ask if you need a slightly different patch: I have finally learned to use mercurial queues, so it's no trouble!

Me parece bien traducido. Le quiero agradecer por un buen trabajo!

Un pequeño error de ortografía:

Línea 23 de la última sección:

"Estas raices" debe ser "Estas raíces".

"""
`\pm \sqrt{2}`.  Estas raices no son racionales, asÃ  que si trabajamos 
"""

Also, I'm trying to figure out why the accents are appearing the way they are. With character substitution in Unicode we should have things that look like 00xx when we read the .rst file rather than Ã. 

If this turns out to be problematic, its fix is simply a find and replace.

`./sage -docbuild es/tutorial html` produces a number of warnings:

```
/home/jule/dev/sage/devel/sage/doc/es/tutorial/tour_groups.rst:2: (WARNING/2) Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

/home/jule/dev/sage/devel/sage/doc/es/tutorial/tour_linalg.rst:118: (WARNING/2) Title underline too short.
```

And some warnings that will probably go away once the tutorial is complete:

For some reason there is one very minor docbuild error message, but the docs nonetheless build fine, including that file (`tour_numtheory.rst`).  It would be nice to fix that but I could not figure out what the problem was.

I have made a proofread of the traslation in the branch 

u/lftabera/tutorial-spanish

But it is based in commit ​f4fca84, so it lacks, at least,

tour_groups.rst
tour_linalg.rst
tour_numtheory.rst
tour_polynomial.rst
tour_rings.rst

I am not sure if some expressions are written to have a more neutral or latin Spanish, I tend to use Castillian Spanish, for instance:

Cómo le hago/Cómo hago

Awesome!

That's fine - just do it at #10165, then.  I've changed that ticket to be about *starting* the translation, and will change this to *continue* it, no problem.

I am not an expert but I would say that it is better to have one `es` translation first, rather than worry about `es_ES` versus `es_MX` or something right now.  If it turns out to be necessary to have such a localization, someone can provide it.  This is very analogous to how much Sage documentation ends up in `en_US` rather than another English variety; it would be great to have the manpower to do both, but far better to have one than none at all.

(This is of course also a challenge thrown down to colleagues in Latin America to provide just such a translation - go to it!  I'm really waiting for the day that we see a huge amount of Sage in `ar_EG` or `zh_CN`; that would be so awesome.)

Anyway, continue the discussion on #10165, and if you have time to work on the translations here too, that would be wonderful.   (See also #17335 if you are really ambitious.)

I was told at some point that I should not write ü because it confuses things. This seems to be not an issue anymore. So I started to put the local way of writing my name. I don't really care that much, I am just trying to be consistent about it now. If it causes trouble, I can go back to the other spelling.
