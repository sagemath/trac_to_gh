The patch (basically written by William at #8614) speeds up these actions by changing the way the binomial coefficients are obtained.

Some timings (the weight seems to be the important parameter here):

<a id='comment:2'></a>
I don't like the following:

```
sage: a = ZZ(10); b = (2*a).binomial(a, algorithm="spam")
sage: b is None
True
```
It should probably raise an error if the algorithm is unrecognized, not just fall of the end of the function and return None.

Also, the "algorithm = mpir" option doesn't seem to allow the computation to be interrupted with Ctrl-C, so if you feed it a very large number by mistake you end up with no alternative but to kill your entire sage session. (The Pari implementation seems to handle interrupts better.) 

Finally, I'd very much prefer it if the generic "binomial" function, called with an integer object, just called the binomial method of that object, and allowed the user to specify an algorithm there instead.
