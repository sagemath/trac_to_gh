Let R be a finite ring (up to now: a finite field or Z<sub>4</sub>). A submodule of R<sup>n</sup> is called a linear code of length n. Two linear codes C, C' over R of length n are equivalent, if there is

* a permutation pi in S<sub>n</sub>
* a multiplication vector phi in R*<sup>n</sup> (R* the set of invertible elements)
* an automorphism alpha of R

with C' = (phi, pi, alpha) C and the action is defined via

(phi, pi, alpha) (c<sub>0</sub>, ..., c<sub>n-1</sub>) = ( phi<sub>0</sub> alpha( c<sub>pi<sup>-1</sup>(0)</sub>) , ... , phi<sub>n-1</sub> alpha( c<sub>pi<sup>-1</sup>(n-1)</sub>) )

This patch adds an algorithm for calculating a unique representative within the equivalence class of a given linear code (returning some unique generator matrix). The algorithm calculates the automorphism group of the code as a byproduct.

Haven't had time to look at this closely but I did test it out to see if it
would apply okay. On a 10.6.4 mac, I got this failure:

This applied fine to sage 4.6.1.a2 on a 10.6.5 mac, however there were some compiler warnings of the form
"warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++".
I don't know if these are important. The patch passes sage -testall.

The patch is huge. I have the following questions:

1) Do you have any tests which compare your output to the output of Robert Miller's
automorphism groups in the case of binary linear codes? For example, does your
program yield the same result that
sage: C = HammingCode(3, GF(2))
sage: C.automorphism_group_binary_code()
does?

2) Do you have any tests which compare your output to the output of the permutation
automorphism groups in the case of non-binary linear codes? For example, does your program yield the same result that
sage: C = HammingCode(2, GF(3))
sage: C.permutation_automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3)]
does?

It seems not. If that is true, it would be great to add them to the
tests.

Also, it is great that you linked your documentation into the manual.
However, most of it is too vague - for example 

```
get_transporter() 
 Returns the transporter element.
...
```
Could this be improved?

I'm going to mark this as "needs work".

This was discussed in ticket:425. They decided to accept this *minor annoyance*.

> The patch is huge. I have the following questions: 1) Do you have any tests which compare your output to the output of Robert Miller's automorphism groups in the case of binary linear codes? For example, does your program yield the same result that sage: C = HammingCode(3, GF(2)) sage: C.automorphism_group_binary_code() does?

Now, there is a test which compares the result of both algorithms showing that the groups are equal.

> 2) Do you have any tests which compare your output to the output of the permutation automorphism groups in the case of non-binary linear codes?

The new examples also try to show the differences in this case. Furthermore, I had some problems in constructing the automorphism group in the case of a finite field of order p<sup>r</sup> as a semidirect product. Maybe someone can give me a hint for improving the following example.

```
sage: GammaGF4 = HammingCode(3, GF(4, 'a') ).check_mat()
sage: canonizer.start_matrix(GammaGF4)
sage: gens = canonizer.get_automorphism_generators()
sage: V = VectorSpace(GF(4, 'a'), GammaGF4.nrows() ) # long time
sage: elts = V.list() # long time
sage: A_correct = PermutationGroup([ PermutationGroupElement( [elts.index( x.apply_map(g[2])*g[0].transpose())+1 for x in elts]) for g in gens ]) # long time
sage: A_correct.order() == canonizer.get_autom_order() # long time
True
```
> Also, it is great that you linked your documentation into the manual. However, most of it is too vague - for example  ` get_transporter()  Returns the transporter element. ... ` Could this be improved? I'm going to mark this as "needs work".

Is this more precise? Maybe we can also discuss the *natural* way of returning the group elements. Mathematically correct via B<sup>-1</sup> or user-friendly without inversion. I have implemented the second way, but I am not sure if the warning sections are sufficient.

There are probably other ideas out there too. How does Magma do it?",

Honestly, I'm not sure the best way of returning the component of the automorphism group which corresponds to field automorohisms. Sage does not seem to have the Galois action on a vector space such as GF(4,"a")^3 implemented. You can try to return an element of this component as a tuple of integers which give the exponents of a Frobenius action. You might also just return it as a separate abelian group. There are probably other ideas out there too. How does Magma do it?

IMHO, it would be good to represent the resulting group generators as sparse matrices.
(Or, perhaps, a new Sage type "MonomialMatrix" ?) 

Did you check that parts of Boost you are using are not in Sage? (It would be more consistent to add them there, if needed, rather than to keep them here).

Would it be possible to factor out the code by Ralf Gugisch into a separate package/patch?
(well, that's certainly a lot of work, I know, so just wondering... I noticed he had some stuff on oriented matroids
implemented, is this a part of it?)

I also noticed that the patch mixes up Unix/Windows encoded files. Can this be streamlined?

The approach of adding a large C++ library is wrong. I started a new attempt written in cython, which uses Robert Millers partition refinement code. This will hopefully become an optional package soon.
