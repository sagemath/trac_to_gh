<div id="comment:0"></div>

This causes a segfault in Sage-4.6:

```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: PR = PolynomialRing(F, 'y')
sage:         y = PR.gen()
sage: v1 = vector([PR(F.random_element())  for i in range(4)])
sage: v1
(0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: vector(F, v1)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

this is due to the call to mod 2 in 

```
 mzd_write_bit(self._entries, 0, i, x[i]%2)            
```
(modules/vector_mod2_dense.pyx":166), where x[i]'s are the coordinates of the vector v1. The latter are in fact polynomials, and taking polynomial mod 2 produces a crash, as 
this low-level thing cannot be applied to Sage polynomials.

The following (coersing x[i] to int before computing modulo 2) appears to cure the problem, although I am not sure whether 
this is the right fix:

Similarly,

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: x // 2r
```

and

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: x.quo_rem(2r)
```

both crash, and things like `gcd(x,2)` give `TypeErrors` instead of trying to coerce.

It looks like adding `@coerce_binop` to a lot of methods in `Polynomial_template` (<code>__mod__, \`__floordiv__\`, quo_rem, gcd...</code>) might work, but for `x // 2r` and `x % 2r` that doesn't help, while strangely `x.__mod__(2r)` and `x.__floordiv__(2r)` don't crash anymore.
