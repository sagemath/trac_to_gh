Pre #9032:

```
sage: mathematica(pi/2).N(50)
1.5707963267948966192313216916397514420985846996876
```

Post #9032:

```
sage: mathematica(pi/2).N(50)
1.5707963267949
```

The `N[]` function from mathematica is being overwritten by `numerical_approx`.  There seems to be no other way to call `N[]` on an existing mathematica object, so this is a problem.

One way to solve this would be to make mathematica functions take precedence over all or most Sage methods.  To call a Sage method one would/should/could use `.sage().whichever_method()`
