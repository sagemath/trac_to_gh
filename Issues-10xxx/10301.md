This worksheet loads the library and does some computations.  With your patch, you should be able to change the "http" in the first cell to "https" and everything should work fine:

Oops.  Any doctest that depends on the internet should be followed by "# optional - internet " like the doctest above it.

In the doctesting framework, that ensures that the doctest is not run unless you have internet available (and you specifically request the internet doctests to be run).

Looks good!  Thanks!

I verified that the doctests pass, but do not access the internet unless the right optional switches are specified.

I just had someone today get the error that this patch fixes, so I'm hoping this will go in soon.
