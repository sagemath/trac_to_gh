Bug raised in sage-devel by Niels Lubbes

[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/33aa40a7685f37aa/d6a6230ee023fd06?show_docid=d6a6230ee023fd06](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/33aa40a7685f37aa/d6a6230ee023fd06?show_docid=d6a6230ee023fd06)

```
 sage: R = PolynomialRing( QQ, var( 't' ), order = 'lex' ) 
 sage: t = R.gens()[0] 
 sage: f = t^4 - t^2 + 1 
 sage: T = NumberFieldTower( [f], 'a0' ) 
 sage: R1 = R.change_ring( T ) 
 sage: a0 = T.gens()[0] 
 sage: t = R1.gens()[0] 
 sage: poly = t^3 + (-4*a0^3 + 2*a0)*t^2 - 11/3*a0^2*t + 2/3*a0^3 - 4/3*a0 
 sage: poly.factor() 
 (t - 2*a0^3 + a0) * (t^2 + (-2*a0^3 + a0)*t - 2/3*a0^2) 
 sage: fact = poly.factor()[1][0] 
 sage: fact.factor() 
 (t - 4/3*a0^3 + 2/3*a0) * (t - 2/3*a0^3 + 1/3*a0) 
```

As Jeroen Demeyer points, it is a bug in Pari.

```
 gp> t; nf = nfinit(a^4 - a^2 + 1); 
 gp> poly = t^3 + (-4*a^3 + 2*a)*t^2 - 11/3*a^2*t + 2/3*a^3 - 4/3*a 
 %1 = t^3 + (-4*a^3 + 2*a)*t^2 - 11/3*a^2*t + (2/3*a^3 - 4/3*a) 
 gp> F = nffactor(nf, poly) 
 %2 = 
 [t + Mod(-2*a^3 + a, a^4 - a^2 + 1) 1] 
 
 [t^2 + Mod(-2*a^3 + a, a^4 - a^2 + 1)*t + Mod(-2/3*a^2, a^4 - a^2 + 1) 1] 
 
 gp> nffactor(nf, F[2,1]) 
 %3 = 
 [t + Mod(-4/3*a^3 + 2/3*a, a^4 - a^2 + 1) 1] 
 
 [t + Mod(-2/3*a^3 + 1/3*a, a^4 - a^2 + 1) 1] 
```

The fix for this bug is in #10430, the attached patch simply adds a doctest.
