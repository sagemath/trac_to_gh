There are two fundamental differences between the Singular and the Gap interfaces:

1. The Singular interface uses a synchronisation method in each call to its eval method. Gap doesn't.
2. The Gap interface deletes variables by declaring that their name may be overwritten. This is not possible in Singular, since Singular variables are statically typed. Thus, the Singular interface explicitly kills the underlying variable in Singular, which requires one call to _eval_line for each variable that is to be deleted.

Unfortunately, waiting for the prompt to appear in a pseudo terminal may be very costly on some systems, since select.select() may be very slow - see #10294. So, additional calls to _eval_line should be strictly avoided!

The first point makes me wonder: Why has the synchronisation method become necessary for Singular but not for Gap?

The second point makes me wonder whether it is really necessary to use one _eval_line for each single deletion.

Moreover, I wonder whether the two points are actually related: I could imagine that synchronisation became necessary when garbage collection, accidentally performed inside an _eval_line, and thus sending an _eval_line inside an outer _eval_line, caused a dead lock in the outer _eval_line. Was that the case, historically?

Suggestions:

1. `singular.eval(cmd)` is currently simply passing `cmd` to _eval_line, after synchronisation and after killing unused variables. I suggest to add the code for killing unused variables to `cmd`, thus using _eval_line only once.
2. If my above guess on the role of synchronisation is correct, then one could simply drop synchronisation after implementing my first suggestion.

This is related with #10294 and perhaps with #10295. Cc to William and Willem-Jan, since they wrote the synchronisation code.

Depends on #7377.

Committing the kills in `singular.eval` by prepending stuff to the given command turned out to break a lot of doc tests, since they test against the given command showing up in the output. But I think one could be even closer to the Gap interface. 

Recall that in the Gap interface, variables are freed by allowing to re-use their names. So, memory allocated in Gap is only freed when the old variable is actually overwritten.

In Singular, memory is freed by the command `kill`. I suggest to use this command not inside `singular.eval` but inside `SingularElement.__init__`: It is put in front of the command that creates the new variable. Then, the analogy between Gap and Singular interfaces is rather close: Memory in Gap or in Singular is freed only when a new Element is created -- by overwriting the old stuff in the case of Gap, or by killing the old stuff in the case of Singular.

Moreover, I removed the synchronisation code, since it seems to me that synchronisation is not really necessary if the garbage collection is not using an additional _eval_line (which is the case with my suggestion).

So, there remains only *one* call to select.select when creating a new Singular element, rather than two plus the number of old variables to be killed. 

Indeed, my approach reduces the overhead in using the Singular interface by 2/3 in the test above!

But there occur two doctest failures, that I have to deal with now.

My patch does the following.

**__Garbage Collection__**

In the Singular interface, freeing the memory used for old variables in Singular  requires to send a "kill" command to Singular, presumably by _eval_line.

A problem would result if garbage collection would create such _eval_line inside an outer _eval_line: The inner _eval_line would cause the outer _eval_line to hang forever. I guess this was the reason why the del method does not actually delete the variables but only marks them for deletion; the actual deletion is postponed to the next use of "eval".

I guess that for the same reason, synchronisation is done at the beginning of "eval".  **Please correct me, if the reason for synchronising so frequently is different!**

I suggest to do the deletions a bit less frequently, namely in the "set" method rather than in the "eval" method. Moreover, I suggest to send the kill command not by a separate _eval_line (one for each old variable), but to prepend the join of all kill commands to the command that creates the new variable.

Since killing does not require an additional _eval_line, nesting can not occur. So, synchronisation is not needed.

**__Overhead Reduction__**

As mentioned in the ticket description, calling _eval_line frequently is bad, since waiting for the Singular prompt in the output of a pseudo terminal produces a massive overhead (up to 22ms per call) on some machines.

My patch removes synchronisation (which avoids one call to _eval_line per call to  eval), and killing old variables does not require any additional _eval_line. So, in the example proposed in the ticket description, the wall time drops by 2/3!

**__Miscellaneous__**

Synchronisation used to fail with an `AttributeError` for the GAP interface. It is fixed by the patch.

I tried to make everything more stable, by giving more opportunities to detect that the interface crashed, and restarting if necessary.

Of course, I added documentation and tests that (I think) cover all issues mentioned here. Moreover, I added tests covering some optional arguments to _eval_line.

For me, `sage -testall` passes. Hence, ready for review!

The old patch needed to be rebased.

The new patch version should apply on top of `sage-4.6.1.alpha3`. I am now running doctests, but I'll keep it "needs review" for now.

I think reducing the overhead in the Singular pexpect interface by 2/3 is a good thing. But the ticket is starting to become old.

Review, anyone?

The reason for that was a typo when I applied one of the hunks manually.

Note that I changed `.interrupt()` into `.interrupt(timeout=1)`  in two doctests. I don't know why, but they failed in about half of the cases. With the timeout parameter, they pass in 10 out of 10 runs.

Does that suffice to return to the positive review?

In any case, I am now running all long doctests.

For the record: The test in question is new.

In sage-4.6 (as I just tested on sage.math), the test would in fact not work at all: When you do

```
sage: cutoff = singular._eval_using_file_cutoff 
sage: singular._eval_using_file_cutoff = 4 
sage: singular._eval_line('for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){i=1;};', wait_for_prompt=False) 
```
then you needed to interrupt it manually.

Now, the problem is that after the lines above, `sage: singular.interrupt()` is supposed to return `False`, which it always did on the command line, but in some (not all) doctest runs returns `True`.

Since we wouldn't have been able to test it without my patch, we actually don't know 
  (1) whether the instability existed before and was uncovered by the patch, 
  (2) whether the problem was introduced by my patch, or
  (3) whether the problem was a result of the changes to the pexpect interface in #7377.

The latter could actually be the case: Today was the first time ever that the `singular.interrupt()` example was problematic - and it was the first time that I worked with the patches from #7377.

I have decided *not* to merge #7377 in the sage-4.7 cycle.  I will merge it in sage-4.7.1.alpha0, such that potential issues with #7377 can be sorted out.

For the moment, the plan is still to merge #7377 in sage-4.7.1.alpha0 together with #10296 and a fixed #10818.  So for the moment, I think we can leave this ticket as it is.

Quite a relief...

I have Debian GNU/Linux squeeze/sid, and I think our administrator did patch the kernel in order to make pseudo-Tty faster. The reason is that, without that kernel patch, the overhead of all pexpect interfaces is abundant. It is, of course, imaginable that the kernel patch is responsible for the flaky behaviour of the test on my machine.

> You can start working from the non-released sage-4.7.1.alpha0: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.1.alpha0/sage-4.7.1.alpha0.tar](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.1.alpha0/sage-4.7.1.alpha0.tar).  This currently includes #7377 but not #10296, but this is of course subject to change.


Thank you, but the compilation of sage-4.7 on bsd.math is already in the final stages (building documentation, if I am not mistaken).

That could be. I already found: If you quit gap by sending "quit;" through the gap interface (by gap.eval) and then try to evaluate a command, then you get a different error or error message on bsd.math than on my computer.

What my patch did was to search for "EOL" in the error message, which should be fast and suffices on my computer (Linux). If it does not suffice (as on bsd.math) then one could still test gap._expect.isalive(). That's slower, but apparently more robust.

The other error you are reporting seems similar in spirit, but is in a different place.

That test is really annoying. I tried to make it more reliable by adding the timeout parameter, but apparently it does not work like that.

However, the main point is that without the patch, we had

```
sage: cutoff = gap._eval_using_file_cutoff 
sage: gap._eval_using_file_cutoff = 4 
sage: gap._eval_line('while(1=1) do i:=1;; od;', wait_for_prompt=False) 
<Runs forever>
```
In other words, we would not even come to the line `gap.interrupt()`.

I would not mind if the new test simply made sure that no error is raised. It does not matter, IMHO, whether we have the return value `True` or `False`. So, perhaps change it into

```
sage: gap.interrupt(timeout=1) is not None
True
```
or

```
sage: gap.interrupt(timeout=1)
...
```

?

The later one would imply that the output is random, but we would miss it if an error was raised so I guess the former would be better. 

```
gap.interrupt(timeout=1) is not None
```
has my vote.

Done

I elaborated the comment.

Without my patch, garbage collection would result in a call to _eval_line. So, if garbage collection occurs while being in _eval_line, we would have two nested calls to _eval_line. The inner _eval_line would receive the Singular prompt and return. The outer _eval_line would also wait for a Singular prompt -- but Singular would not provide a second prompt. Result: A deadlock.

To my understanding, this is why synchronisation of the Singular interface was necessary. But with my patch, garbage collection does not involve an additional call to _eval_line, and thus the deadlock is prevented without synchronisation.

>  * why did you indent REMARK etc. further in pid()?


To the contrary, the first line of the doc string of pid() needed to be indented more! Fixed with the new patch version.

Yes, have a "break". :-)




Since cleo is not the fastest machine, and I assume the above occurred when doctesting in parallel, I would either ignore it (if it doesn't happen too often), or try with increasing the timeout (to a few seconds) and if that helps, change the doctest permanently.

For the test I don't think it matters whether we wait 1 or 5 seconds, probably even more; it's only important that Singular finally *does* get interrupted (within perhaps at most half a minute, say).
