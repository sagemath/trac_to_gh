The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```

The implementation depends on its realization as a subword complex.

Depends on #20111
Depends on #20027

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

Hi,

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

 AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse' object has no attribute 'is_skew_symmetrizable'

I have made a git branch with one part of the patch, not touching the file `cluster_seed.py` in order to keep it as independent as possible.

I have also cleaned the code a little bit to make sur it passes the pyflakes and pep8 tests.

Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

Okay, I now use a naive implementation. But I am missing

```
AttributeError: 'CoxeterMatrixGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'root_to_reflection'

Is there chance to get this method ? Otherwise, I will just delete that method needing this for now. I can then get it back later, if desired.

I think this is the best way to do things (at least because their implementation was simple).

Coxeter groups don't necessarily have all of the methods that Weyl groups have (since they are not tied to a particular root lattice). You should be able to use `W.reflections()[beta]` from #20027, and it *should* work as well for Weyl groups now that the behavior is consistent.

Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
