The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```

The implementation depends on its realization as a subword complex.

<a id='comment:1'></a>some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hello Christian,

I have made a git branch with one part of the patch, not touching the file `cluster_seed.py` in order to keep it as independent as possible.

I have also cleaned the code a little bit to make sur it passes the pyflakes and pep8 tests.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

<a id='comment:44'></a>Okay, I now use a naive implementation. But I am missing

```
AttributeError: 'CoxeterMatrixGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'root_to_reflection'
```
Is there chance to get this method ? Otherwise, I will just delete that method needing this for now. I can then get it back later, if desired.

<a id='comment:54'></a>Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
