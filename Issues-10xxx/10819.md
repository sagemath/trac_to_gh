The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```

The implementation depends on its realization as a subword complex.

some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

Hi,

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

 AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse' object has no attribute 'is_skew_symmetrizable'

Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
