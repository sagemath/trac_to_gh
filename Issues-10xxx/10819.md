The patch contains an implementation of the cluster complex for finite types.

```
sage: ClusterComplex(['A',3])
Cluster complex of type ['A', 3] with 9 vertices and 14 facets
```

The implementation depends on its realization as a subword complex.

Depends on #20111
Depends on #20027

some comments :

there is a typo in "facet" at the beginning.

The examples are wrong, because they call "associahedron" which has nothing to do with the simplicial complex.

There is a "tba" in the examples section, that should be removed or replaced by a true example

You should include serious tests, like the computation of the homology of an example.

Hi,

1) here also, the header is not correct, you should add ticket number #10819.


2) this seems to be a real error, which appears several times :

 AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse' object has no attribute 'is_skew_symmetrizable'

2) formatting of doc is not correct in cartan_type

I really appreciate that you do some progress on these patches, thanks!

I think I will reimplement this patch using subword complexes rather than the cluster implementation. This will be much faster, and I don't expect that the cluster package will become part of main sage soon (see the dependency above). On the other hand, the subword complexes depend on my new implementation of finite reflection groups (#11187) which depends on the implementation of the universal cyclotomic field (#8327), so it will also be unlikely that it will get positively reviewed soon (and I see that all of them have rejects in the newest versions, so it will be an even longer way).

I will update the patch fixing these issues.

I have also cleaned the code a little bit to make sur it passes the pyflakes and pep8 tests.

<a id='comment:28'>Comment 28:</a>
Hey Christian and Frédéric, here are my comments:

- We should use the standard copyright template from ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files for all new files.
- The file should be added to the documentation.
- You should run the `TestSuite` on the cluster complex (often this is done in the `__init__` tests).
- Error messages are typically not considered as sentences, so they should start with a lower case and not end with a period.
- Your `__call__` does not appear to be idempotent, i.e., `C(C((0,1)))` should equal (or even better, be identical to) `C((0,1))`.
- You aren't properly using the category framework by not having `ClusterComplexFacet` as the `Element` attribute of `ClusterComplex`, and subsequently, you should use `self.element_class` in `ClusterComplex`.
- The methods of `ClusterComplexFacet` should at least have a one-line description of what the method does.

Some of these comments extend to the `SubwordComplex`, which might require a separate ticket to work on.

I think this is the best way to do things (at least because their implementation was simple).

Coxeter groups don't necessarily have all of the methods that Weyl groups have (since they are not tied to a particular root lattice). You should be able to use `W.reflections()[beta]` from #20027, and it *should* work as well for Weyl groups now that the behavior is consistent.

<a id='comment:54'>Comment 54:</a>
Indeed, greetings from Korea.

I pushed some changes:

- I moved the description of the cluster complex to the class-level doc (instead of the module-level doc) so it can be visible from `ClusterComplex?`.
- I updated the reference bibliographic info.
- I added more tests to `__classcall__` to make sure it covers all of the code paths/input formats.
- I removed the verbose output from `TestSuite` as these can change as tests get added and it's annoying to make these trivial changes all over Sage (not that it happens that often).
- Other misc tweaks.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
