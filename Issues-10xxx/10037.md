The following causes cddlib to crash; I'm not sure if this is fixable without patching the cddlib source:

```
p4 = polytopes.permutahedron(5,project=True)
pn4 = p4.projection()
p3  = pn4.schlegel()
verts = p3.transformed_coords
edges = p3.lines
topes = []
for q in p4.facial_incidences():
    topes.append([verts[i] for i in q[1]])
Polyhedron(vertices=topes[3], field=RDF, verbose=True)
```

output ends with:

```
Facet graph
*Error: Possibly an LP cycling occurs.  Use the Criss-Cross method.
```

Apply trac_10037_polyhedron_bug.patch to the sage library

Depends on #14479

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This one actually works for me (Fedora 13 x86_64):

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=topes[3], field=RDF, verbose=True)
[... vebose cdd interaction ...]
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 23 vertices.
```
Just out of curiosity, which arch is that failing on?

I think the way to go is to implement vertex/facet adjacencies ourselves with a modern LP solver, either cvxopt or PPL. 

I've opened #10039 as a first step to switch to PPL.

#14479 adds raising a proper error, so I consider this fixed. Use rationals for exact arithmetic.

Patch is for a regression in calling `schlegel()` without specifying the direction.
