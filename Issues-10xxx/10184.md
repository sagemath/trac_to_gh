the class group iterator takes evey element in turn, and computes the product of the `g^i`'s. Sure powers are computed by repeated squaring, but for iterators this is suboptimal.

On my laptop, from this situation...

```

sage: K.<v>=NumberField(x^4 + 514*x^2 + 64321)
sage: OK=K.maximal_order()
sage: G=K.class_group()                        
sage: time _=G.list()
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 2.53 s
Wall time: 2.53 s

```

the attached patch improves to...

```

sage: K.<v>=NumberField(x^4 + 514*x^2 + 64321)
sage: OK=K.maximal_order()
sage: G=K.class_group()                        
sage: time _=G.list()
CPU times: user 0.45 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.45 s
Wall time: 0.44 s

```

which is a tad better.

doctest included (actually the previous doctest wasn't doing much, this one is slightly more thorough).

Note: while the code would work for any abelian group, I believe it makes sense only when the group operation is sufficiently non-trivial.

I think it just hasn't been reviewed by anyone.

There are some formatting problems.  The "sage:" indentation should be left as it was:

```
TESTS::

    sage: ...
```
And you really should put a blank line between 2 functions, lines 213--214.

Also: please put your real name in the Author field on the ticket.

Hi.

Thanks for your feedback. I just posted another version of the patch which fixes indentation, and adds documentation and doctests to _iter_inner_.

Looking back at this, and considering your warning on the generators returned by pari, I think that the doctest for the iterator is probably too fragile. What do you think ?

E.
