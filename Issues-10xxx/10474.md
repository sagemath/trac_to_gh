As the title suggests, `sage.misc.sagedoc.sphinxify(s, format="text")` returns an empty string when `s` contains a line that begins a list item (such as `"- foo"`, `"* foo"`, `"1. foo"`, etc.) immediately followed by a line with greater indentation than the first (such as `"   bar"`, `"   bar"`, and `"    bar"` respectively). However, calling the function without the option `format="text"` returns (slightly broken) HTML reflecting a reasonable interpretation of the input string.

```
sage: sage.misc.sagedoc.sphinxify("- foo\n   bar")
'<div class="docstring">\n    \n  <ul>\n<li><dl class="first docutils">\n<dt>foo</dt>\n<dd><p class="first last">bar</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</div>'
sage: sage.misc.sagedoc.sphinxify("- foo\n   bar", format="text")
''
```

The above snippet is from a sage 4.6 interpreter session.

I'm not too sure, but after some digging around in sage, it *looks* like this is a sphinx issue, but I thought I should report it here first anyway, just in case...

The expected behavior, I would think, would be either for both text mode and html mode to refuse to interpret the string, or for both of them to parse it in similar ways.
