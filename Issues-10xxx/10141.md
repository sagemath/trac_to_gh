<div id="comment:0"></div>

Observe that the printing is wrong in the special case of class number 1:

```
sage: NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'i').class_group()
Class group of order 1 with structure  of Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: 
```

In particular "with structure  of Number Field ..."  where there is something after "structure" missing. 

Component: **number fields**
