Implement:

```
    sage -sws2rst bla.sws bli.sws ...
```

which given worksheets

`bla.sws, bli.sws, ...` would create ReST files `bla.rst, bli.rst, ...` together with media directories:

```
media/bla/
media/bla/data/
media/bla/7/sage0.png
...
media/bli/
...
```

The proposed implementation adds a script
`local/bin/sage-sws2rst`, edits `spkg/bin/sage` to add
the sws2rst option, and add some libraries in
`sagenb-main/sagenb/notebook/`. It further depends on the
BeautifulSoup Python library (released under Python's license).

The script builds the ReST file from the worksheet.html file included in the .sws as follow:

- Preparsing to handle the input / output fields
- Parsing of the resulting html using BeautifulSoup
- Manipulation on the obtained tree

Suggestions for better file layout or implementation welcome!

## Install instructions

* It's necessary to install the beautifulsoup spkg

* A first patch adds the sage-sws2rst script, and it must be imported on the local/bin dir

* A second patch sends three files to sagenb/misc and it must be imported on the devel/sagenb dir, and followed by a

```
    sage -python setup.py install && sage -python setup.py develop
```

## Comments

The code above is preliminary and undocumented, but I post it in order to guide the discussion. I'll write comments and make improvements when we decide on some issues.

I have to warn the task is not trivial, as html is more relaxed than rst, so that some editing is required after the conversion. The result from the script produces rst files that get compiled correctly only on occassion, but usually the modifications required are not much.

## How it works

The sws file is uncompressed, and the images inside the 'data' and the 'cell/xx' dirs ar copied to a '_media' dir (this is done by the sage-sws2rst file). 

Then the file worksheet.html is parsed, and split into comments, source code and output. The first is handled using the library BeautifulSoup. Source code is mostly untouched, and results are parsed to find some patterns like "image", "latex", "docstring", "other html patterns" and "plain text". The first two are displayed. The docstring, or any unrecognized html in the result cells are discarded. Plain text is indented, and is recognized as the output of the previous cell.

## Issues

* rest does not understand that images or latex are the output of some code cells.

* docstrings are ignored. I felt stupid trying to parse some html that comes from a rst file. Maybe I can grab the rst file from the source, but only if it belongs to the library, so is it worth it?

Please add your concerns here.

Hi Pablo!

I just used your script for preparing my next demo from a previous
worksheet. It worked smoothly, thanks so much! It would be really good
to get this in; alas, I don't feel qualified to review code touching
the notebook. A couple tiny comments:

* Could you add the installation instructions to the ticket
  description? This will make Jeroen happy :-)

* I had to fix the execution rights on the script:

  ```
   chmod +x /opt/sage/local/bin/sage-sws2rst
  ```

* Shall the advertisement of the option appear in `sage -h` or
  `sage -advanced`. I could argue for `sage -h` since this
  functionality is for sage users as much as developpers.

* Support for converting several sws at once would be handy.

  ```

nthiery, this is still reviewing!  I'm adding you, even if you don't feel like you can give positive review.

Also, we'll want correct commit messages for the release manager.

Ah, I forgot to mention:

What about using '----' instead of ':::::' to underline subsection titles?

It seems a bit more readable, and ':' is already used quite a lot by
Sphinx; and one could imagine a very (very!) short title producing a
confusing '::'.

Expected:

Got:

They look the same. They both use spaces, not tabs.

If I run the test from a sage console, it works (with ==).

any ideas?

This is great! I notice that when this is run on old notebook files, one gets the following error:

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-4.7.rc0/local/bin/sage-sws2rst", line 66, in <module>
    process_sws(file_name)

    for cell in os.listdir(cells_path):
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/Iterators and backtracking.sws/sage_worksheet/cells'
```

I think this is because there is another directory level on these old-style worksheets:

```
   '/tmp/Iterators and backtracking.sws/sage_worksheet/<some number>/cells'
```

It would be nice if this error could be caught and the user given a message to the effect of "Conversion failed. Try opening your notebook with a recent version of sage, resaving it, and running the script again".

My worksheet name included spaces.  A few images led to this being in the text: 

```
.. image:: PREP Quickstart, NumAnalysis_media/cell_5_sage0.png

```

However, the html output from running sphinx on the rst file included a link to this image:

```
<img alt="PREPQuickstart,NumAnalysis_media/cell_5_sage0.png" class="align-center" src="PREPQuickstart,NumAnalysis_media/cell_5_sage0.png" /> 

```

(notice the missing spaces)

I looked around and this is a bug report here: https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/453/spaces-get-stripped-from-image-file-names

According to http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/rst-directives.html#image, the first thing done in the image directive is to discard all whitespace, so this script should probably discard all whitespace when making the image links.

Okay, I tried this, but got

```
$ ../../sage -sws2rst ~/Downloads/Test4sws2rst.sws 
<snip>
  File "/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta1-flask/local/lib/python/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/Users/.../Test4sws2rst.sws/sage_worksheet'
```
which might make sense based on [comment:23](#comment%3A23), except this was a brand-new worksheet.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong in using it?

The specific place in sage-sws2rst that breaks is

```
sws_file.extractall(tempname)
```
and the rest the Python this calls.

Here is the problem, in pure Python

```
>>> tempname = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "/Users/.../Test4sws2rst.sws")
>>> tempname
'/Users/.../Test4sws2rst.sws'
>>> tempfile.gettempdir()
'/var/folders/Yy/YytEJm5VEB0+pBRD7JNLe++++TQ/-Tmp-'
```
Why isn't this working right?  Ah, looking at the help tells me...

```
If any component is an absolute path, all previous path components
    will be discarded.
```
So apparently one can only do an extraction from the same directory (`../` gives a similar problem).

But then!

```

$ ./sage -sws2rst Test4sws2rst.sws 
Test4sws2rst.sws
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta1-flask/local/bin/sage-sws2rst", line 66, in <module>
    process_sws(file_name)
  File "/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta1-flask/local/bin/sage-sws2rst", line 39, in process_sws
    for cell in os.listdir(cells_path):
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/folders/Yy/YytEJm5VEB0+pBRD7JNLe++++TQ/-Tmp-/Test4sws2rst.sws/sage_worksheet/cells'
```
And now I nearly give up.  Isn't the point exactly to create such things?  I'm doing something wrong here, or maybe I rebased the patches wrong?  I don't think so...

Here we go.

```
$ ls /var/folders/Yy/YytEJm5VEB0+pBRD7JNLe++++TQ/-Tmp-/Test4sws2rst.sws/sage_worksheet/
worksheet.html		worksheet.txt		worksheet_conf.pickle
```

No cells.  I wonder why?  worksheet.html does have stuff in it.  Now I really am stumped.

**WOW!!! **  This is really awesome!  I did a moderately complicated worksheet just now, and had only one error message.

```
: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```
This was in a sublist.  Here is the html source in `sage_worksheet`.

```
<p>This works because Sage is very collaborative. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who has access to the server can be invited to share a document.</li>
<li>In this case, the teacher would post a lab, and the students could share a copy of it with each other to work on it.</li>
<li>Then, when they are done, they can:
<ul>
<li>Publish it to the server for the teacher to view, or&nbsp;</li>
<li>Share it with the teacher, or&nbsp;</li>
<li>Download it to be uploaded by the teacher...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
```
I don't know whether this is 'needs work' or for a future ticket, since it still looks right in the built Sphinx output.

Also, along the same priority lines, if you include jpg images in the data directory, I guess they don't always look quite right - that is, they don't scale with the size of the picture.  I guess that is just because they are jpg files, not png - probably there is no real solution to this.  The graphics from Sage do fine.

---

More importantly, I think that there we need to add some documentation as to how to use this somewhere.  What do you think?  I think that [the Sphinx tutorial](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/tutorial.html) in conjunction with the following would do it.

* To turn a worksheet into nice documentation outside the Sage doc tree, first make a folder somewhere convenient labeled (say) `MyProject`.
* Then move your `.sws` file into that folder, and cd into it.
* Now the key is to use Sage's shell to run Sphinx on it!  Run `sage -sh` here.
* Now type `sphinx-quickstart` and follow the instructions in the Sphinx tutorial.  you will probably want to render math with MathJax.
* If you now type `make html` you should get a beautiful-looking web page in `_build/html`.  Other things like `make pdf` will do the same.

Here's another thing.  As far as I can tell, one can pretty much only run this on an `.sws` that is in the directory you live in.  So we need to document this in the same place.

---

So here are the issues for 'needs work'.  
* Make `sage -sws2rst` fail gracefully if one hasn't installed the beautifulsoup spkg.  Naturally, this requires beautifulsoup to be an optional or at least experimental spkg.  Since it's just a Python thing, that shouldn't be a problem.
* Add documentation.  This doesn't need to be intense.
* Somehow we have to resolve this issue with the older worksheets (if it is in fact an issue).
* Figure out how to deal with the case where there are no `cells/` in the worksheet for some reason.

Okay, I can reproduce this.
* Create a new worksheet.
* Save it immediately (no computation).
* Download it and process with `sage -sws2rst`.

Probably something like "delete all output" could also make this happen.
I don't know why a worksheet wouldn't have cells in other cases, but at any rate this can happen under "natural" circumstances as well as my weird one.

By the way, the stuff generated is not perfect, mainly because many of us use TinyMCE header styles to do larger fonts - just easier than trying to figure out how to make larger text and center it.

No response, but given that this is available via both `pip` and `easy_install`, I say it should be optional at the end of this.

Now we just need review of the review patches, and the sagenb patches.

You may want to get an account on the sage.math cluster.

Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about doctests outside of sagenb, since this doesn't actually change the Sage library at all!  The changes are in the actual script, and so checking that it still works the same as you intended and has correct logic is the most important thing.

Once that was true, all that would remain would be for me or someone else other than you to review the actual sagenb stuff you originally included in [attachment:tools_sws2rst_4.patch].  I may eventually be able to do so, but such parsing is slow going for me.  I wonder if one of the folks from sage-combinat might be recruited to do so?  On the plus side, there is very little chance of bitrot on the sagenb end, and fixing it on the Sage end should be relatively straightforward.

Okay, I've read through the code, and here is everything I have to say without actually trying it out on a variety of worksheets.  Anyone have any comments on my patch to the actual script?

---

To me, the main issue is that the code needs to be fairly well-formed.  Is worksheet.html really always that well-formed of HTML?  I just don't know.   

The reasons this doesn't concern me too much are 
1. The worst that could happen is that the rst doesn't look good, but nothing gets destroyed
2. Presumably someone wouldn't bother to use this functionality in the first place without checking that the worksheet at least looked nice
3. Presumably BeautifulSoup makes the html more well-formed

Places this could go wrong, maybe, with weird input, below.  Keep in mind I'm not at all a regex wizard, so that could be part of my questions.  I'd appreciate any responses to whether these could be problems; although most of them wouldn't be a big issue, I still feel like especially the first several really require (for me) explanation.
* $$ that are intended to be empty LaTeX for later filling in - definitely counts on $$ always existing in pairs
* I'm not sure about the replace_courier thing.  Are you saying that you, personally, use Courier font to indicate code in TinyMCE, and this is how you replace it with <code></code> tags?  It would be nice for this to be customizable; otherwise, what happens to the poor sap who happens to like Courier and then finds all their text replaced by code?
* It looks like in visiting ordered lists, that all sublists will automatically becomes numbered.  But couldn't one have an unordered list inside an ordered list?
* in the replace_latex thing, is it conceivable that the re's would match something by mistake?  It looks like e.g. latex_beginning is matching anything that starts and ends with a dollar sign, as long as it really does end with a dollar sign and not \$, where that would include any character (possibly zero) before that.  Again, in a well-formed worksheet that wouldn't be a problem, but maybe sometimes people would do things like "$\$$".
* Or what if the TinyMCE was (completely) "h$x+y=z$", then wouldn't this get replaced by ":math:`x+y=z`" with the h gone?  It seems like you're assuming \\1 is a whitespace character?
* How could the branch of visit_strong with _inside_code_tag be reached?  The only place this flag seems to be True is in visit_code, but in that case one just gets plain text and and wouldn't visit_strong, it seems to me

You said:\n\nReplying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A59):\n> * In results sections, is all html being removed?  Is there a reason for this?  I assume that this is to take care of a specific type of result that can occur that I can't think of right now.  After all, a Sage cell is a Python cell, and html certainly could be legitimate output.\n\n\nWhat should I do? I don't feel like parsing it into rst, because it's output, and parsing is lossy. I cannot be too literal either, because I have to leave something that works when the rst files are rendered into html, tex or whatever.\n\nThe question is related to others, like the one on tracebacks for example.

Thanks again, Karl. I will address most comments later, after some experiment, but I'd love to hear your opinion on one of them. You said:

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A59):
> * In results sections, is all html being removed?  Is there a reason for this?  I assume that this is to take care of a specific type of result that can occur that I can't think of right now.  After all, a Sage cell is a Python cell, and html certainly could be legitimate output.


What should I do? I don't feel like parsing it into rst, because it's output, and parsing is lossy. I cannot be too literal either, because I have to leave something that works when the rst files are rendered into html, tex or whatever.

The question is related to others, like the one on tracebacks for example. I didn't like long tracebacks in the docs, which would scare my non-technical prospective readers. Should I rewrite sws2rst to incorporate several config options, like long_tracebacks or parse_html_in_results or replace_monospace_font_by_code_tags? Can you think of others?

Here's an example - `@`interact output is html.  In sws2tex, whuss and friends just completely ignore them - perhaps not the worst idea, given that it's supposed to be interactive and a tex (or rst) document isn't, by definition.

So before I get to it, I want to say that **in general, this is working great; everything that doesn't work is easily fixable in the rst source file by a very much non-expert in ReST like myself**.  If some of these things are fixable - particularly the extra newline needed in lists, and the issue with math formatting - that would be best before this makes it into Sage, but most of the rest should be in an upgrade.

But of course the ids are mostly gone, I guess.\n* The way you replace a span by a `\\n` means that sometimes TinyMCE stuff left over from trying to unformat things gets in a new line.  TinyMCE is annoying that way - sometimes to unitalicize you have to do a few things.  Anyway, users will have to expect lots of newlines because of that.  In one case, I *intentionally* had used a lot of different ones, and since bold isn't a span, but everything else you can do is, the doc looked kind of weird, lots of new lines.  In another case, the text was colored on purpose.\n\n```\nPlot a green <span style=\"color: #008000;\">$y=\\sin(x)$</span> together with...\n```\n   and then it made a new line there.  I'm wondering why you chose to make `\\n` instead of just a space - surely you encountered some \"real-life\" examples where that was the better option.

   Note the space before the comma, which shows up in the built doc as well.

```
 - Sage uses the Python programming language, which uses this syntax, 'under the hood', and

 - Because it makes it easier to distinguish among

   yields

```
WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```
   pretty consistently.   This should be fixed, and probably isn't too hard to do by adding an extra `\n` somewhere in the ul code.  I would say that 90% of the Sphinx errors I got were this.
* There were also a few like this.

```
WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```
   This comes from turning things like

```
<p>The most obvious one is simply turning $$\int f(x)dx$$ into $$\int_a^b f(x)dx\; ,$$ as indicated in the Calculus I section. &nbsp;</p>
```
into

The most obvious one is simply turning
.. MATH::

    \int f(x)dx

  into
.. MATH::

    \int_a^b f(x)dx\; ,

```
   Not only is there the issue with the reinterpretation of the math block as a literal block, but it interprets the extra words as part of the literal block - but only because they for some reason got extra spaces.
* I found one thing that doesn't show up properly because of the html blocks being removed - documentation!  If one evaluates a cell like `binomial??` then that is all html, and just disappears.

* Back to issues about lists.  I think that you are starting too big.  The first indent level should just be at the main level; the ones after that can be indented by one.  Isn't this

```
- item one

 - item 1a
 - item 1b

- item two

 - item 2a
 -item 2b
```
   more correct than

```
 - item one
  - item 1a
  - item 1b

 - item two
  - item 2a
  -item 2b
```
   which you currently have?  If you look at rendered worksheets, you'll see what I mean - everything is just a little too far in.

And as a followup, doing another group of simpler worksheets yielded only three bullet list errors and a few other things.    I did have a couple MathJax issues, but I'm pretty sure that's what they are, nothing to do with the patches here.

Humbly disagreeing with jhpalmieri about the absolute paths, since I documented it - but of course that would be great, what magic makes this work but not the other version?  If this does in fact work, then I guess that would be good too.

The point is that we don't want to make the review process overly long here.

Some suggestions for code.  Ignore if stupid.

Not sure what to do about that; why didn't the greater than sign just become a greater than sign when translated from html back?

Okay, I think that what happens is that in `replace_latex` you only replace these characters *if* there was no LaTeX to replace in the first place.  But of course that might not always be the case.  This isn't a huge issue, but worth pointing out and probably easy to fix.

---

In `visit_li`, I think that replacing

```
        return (' '*self._nested_list 
                + ('#. ' if self._inside_ol else '- ') 
                +' '.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents))
```
with `' '*(self._nested_list-1)` should work.  That was also a very minor point.

---

Would reversing the setting in `visit_ol` for `visit_ul` work for allowing nested mixed lists?

```
self._inside_ol = False
blah
self._inside_ol = True
```

---

Would replacing, in `visit_display`,

```
return ('\n.. MATH::\n\n    ' + 
```
with

```
return ('\n\n.. MATH::\n\n    ' + 
```
help with the math display issue?

---

In `visit_li`, maybe a number of potential issues (in addition to the math not being indented enough) could be solved by 

```
    def visit_li(self, node): 
        return (' '*self._nested_list 
                + ('#. ' if self._inside_ol else '- ') 
                +' '.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents))
```
with

```
    def visit_li(self, node):
        spacing = ' '*(self._nested_list - 1) 
        return (spacing 
                + ('#. ' if self._inside_ol else '- ') 
                +' '.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents).replace('\n','\n'+spacing) )
```
What do you think?  This just preserves the indentation until the soup gives us the end of the list item, if I did it right.

---

To solve the issue with the unexpected indent, it looks like it would suffice to change the `visit_ul` and `visit_ol` to have

```
result = '\n' + '\n'.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents)
```
I think that changing `visit_li` will be less optimal, since there are already newlines between all of those things.  This is where it should be handled.

---

Sorry for not having nice diffs like John - I haven't tried these out, just thinking out loud about code.

I work around a possible problem if $$ and <p>...</p> are not correctly nested, because I observed that this happens, but I assumed that there is no unpaired $$ because the jsmath in the notebook makes that kind of mistake pretty obvious.

> * I'm not sure about the replace_courier thing.  Are you saying that you, personally, use Courier font to indicate code in TinyMCE, and this is how you replace it with <code></code> tags?

Done: I don't use that function any more

Solved

It looks like e.g. latex_beginning is matching anything that starts and ends with a dollar sign, as long as it really does end with a dollar sign and not \$, where that would include any character (possibly zero) before that.

Nice catch! I've taken care of that.

Nope, I collect that char too.

> * How could the branch of visit_strong with _inside_code_tag be reached?  The only place this flag seems to be True is in visit_code, but in that case one just gets plain text and and wouldn't visit_strong, it seems to me


You're damn right.

ok, done.

Yes, but that's not tinyMCE dependent, and I haven't seen it fail. With any parser, there is wrong input that will produce problems.

can you give an example? I've tried several configurations and BeautifulSoup seems pretty robust

That's correct. That was probably to deal with <code>var = <strong>my_func</strong>(spam, eggs)</code>, but if you'd rather do something else I'd like to know.

No, TinyMCE does not use the footer, but it's no big deal: now we take care of both.

You're right. Problem is: with tinyMCE I got a nested list that was inside an <li> tag for the parent list, but of course I want to allow also for the nested ul to be inside the ul directly, so: is there is any problem is I just add an excess of blank lines:

`result = '\n\n' + '\n'.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents)`

I don't really remember why I did that, but it also screwed html tables in some situations, so it's best, and more naturally, made into a space.

That was solved by unindenting the list items one place, as proposed in other place. Would not work if you have display math inside a nested list. A solution was to place comments ".. end of MATH" after any display math environment. I could do the same with lists and any other indentation-dependent environment.

I can't change the pull request, since you created and own it. Only you can change it. I can however make a new pull request if you don't know how to change your pull request. I'm currently traveling, though, so I can't do it immediately, I'm afraid.

Hmm, good point.

What do you do instead?  What happens to things in code tags?

Yup.

It looks like e.g. latex_beginning is matching anything that starts and ends with a dollar sign, as long as it really does end with a dollar sign and not \$, where that would include any character (possibly zero) before that.  Again, in a well-formed worksheet that wouldn't be a problem, but maybe sometimes people would do things like "$\$$".

I see that, and I *think* it works.  I may have to look at it more closely, as `single_dollar` is one I have to consult my regex resources for :)

More to come...

Good solution.  Since in ReST things are supposed to be unique, there could conceivably be some nastiness if one had links in several worksheets that pointed to the same thing, but that would be fixable by the user.

If I could, I can't any more.  We'll let it pass.

I don't remember any more.  I think that I was just wondering what sort of other things might end up in a <pre> tag, and whether some might not be "block literals" in Sphinx terms.  I don't know the answer to this.

Well, maybe.  That should be a different patch; we should really get this in.

That's not a bad idea.  And I like your catching of the identical heading thing - that may have been a little of the problem.  That said, if only we could catch this thing... anyway, fixing the no heading worksheet is a good idea.

Finally, I'm just wondering about a few changes - surely it's obvious what they do, but I'm lazy.

No, it's the
147	 	            'p': 'inline_no_tag', 
 	159	            'p': 'p', 

plus the:

 	331	    def visit_p(self, node): 
 	332	        return ''.join(self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents) + '\n\n' 

by the way, the following lines are garbage:

 	333	        cs = [self.visit(tag) for tag in node.contents] 
 	334	        return ' '.join(c for c in cs if c.strip()) + '\n\n' 

Karl, should I make a single patch, and fix also this little stupid thing?

I've done nothing, I guess I could drop the code that discards the empty code cells, but on the other hand, I want them out of my pdf...

Following the documentation of BeautifulSoup, that should convert entities like &amp; into & and $lt; into <, but it doesn't work, so I do it later anyway. In a later ticket, I'll update to a newer version of BeautifulSoup, and this will be a useful reminder.

>  * The `images_dir` stuff - was that in response to anything I said? 


No, that's in order to be able to use worksheet2rst as a sage-independent script. Found it useful during testing.

Don't make a single patch, but do change the `response_to_kcrisman` patch and add this and that thing where you catch a worksheet with an empty title and add a title.

> I've done nothing, I guess I could drop the code that discards the empty code cells, but on the other hand, I want them out of my pdf...

Eventually one would want this to be a switch, but I guess it's ok for now.  That could be an enhancement request.

Thanks for the answers to the other two questions.

So now I should probably actually test that this works on the things I used it on before :) and then hopefully a pull request will be possible to make.

Concerning indentation:

In my worksheet, I have something in a html field that looks like this:

**__Outline__**

**Use existing base classes**

    There are sub-classes of sage.structure.parent.Parent resp. of sage.structure.element.Element that will help you a lot. Inheriting from these classes is essential for using Sage's coercion system.

    Arithmetic operations should be implemented by single underscore methods, such as `_add_`, _mul_.

The outcome then looks like

**Outline**

OK. I guess that in the end I have to edit the rst file anyway.

> Unrecognized tags will not be guessed at, I think that is a feature.


The notebook comes with an editor (`tinyMCE`, or what is it's name?), and I think sws2rst should be able to work with what is produced by the editor.

> Indentation I'm not sure about.  Whitespace doesn't count; you should really be using some formatting for that,


I used the editor in the notebook. Shouldn't that be fine?

When I click on the "text" link, I see

So, that's what is produced by the editor.

The rst file created from a worksheet seems to end each code cell by

```
.. end of output
```

Is there any use of that line? When I removed it, the resulting html looked the same.

The problem, if i remember correctly, comes if there is a list after an output cell. The list is indented one space, but the output cell does not end until it finds a non-indented line.

Yes, that does make sense.  I guess the question is whether "premature optimization is the root of all evil" or not.  In this case, I think that having an sws2rst converter in Sage that at least converts *some* stuff, but can't handle styles, is worse than having no sws2rst converter at all.  I have found this to be extremely useful in its current state, so I'm not sure it's worth postponing it indefinitely for this reason (as opposed to checking the code itself, which I have lamentably not had time to finish off, but which I should do today).

I think that the problem is that 

```
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
```
is how you achieved your indentation.  That's an HTML style, not whitespace.   

Okay, on further investigation, what you must have done is clicked the "indent" button.  Usually I only use this with lists, which creates more levels of lists (and which sws2rst already handles correctly).

Pablo, do you think that finding this particular thing?  That is, if we have

```
style="padding-left: 60px;"
```
where 60 could be any positive integer multiple of 30, as a specific thing in the tag `<p ...>`, could that specific thing be searched for and then replaced with an equivalent amount of whitespace (maybe four `&nbsp;` for instance, per 30px)?  Certainly it would be nightmarish to try to make that into an appropriate amount of lists, and in any case we don't want the list bullets in that case.

Okay, for positive review we need the following, in my opinion.  The previous work issues were dealt with long ago.
* Still to check that regex, though apparently it's working fine
* Add levels `<h5>` and `<h6>` (see [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.5), h6 is also actually supported by TinyMCE in Sage)
* Decide what to do with address tag (possibly turn it into pre tag? just an idea) and do that

* Make an updated pull request for sagenb (luckily not a problem with respect to rebasing, since we only add new files)

I guess you mean "is better than"...

Anyway. I found the converter very useful, and so I will soon be able to provide a new thematic tutorial, by conversion of a worksheet that I occasionally used in talks on coercion. So, from me it is "+1" to make it available.

However, I am no sphinx/rst expert nor an expert notebook user. So, I don't feel qualified to be a reviewer for this.

I think we need to save that for another ticket; although it's unfortunate that TinyMCE does this, I have a feeling this will never get in at all if we wait for one of us to have time to do it (there will be some tricky parsing to do).

It turned out that making it into em is the best way to emulate what is there.\n\nI *did* discover a different issue - it turns out that we probably aren't dealing with line breaks correctly inside of things like strong and em.  In HTML you can have multiple lines inside of such a tag, but just adding a newline doesn't work for this, as ReST treats\n\n```\n*Your name\nYour email*\n```\nas one line of text, which is the usual behavior, but\n\n```\n*Your name\n\nYour email*\n```\nis no longer emphasized.

Yes.  The reason it didn't work for Simon is that Pablo added it to the list of headers, but not the list of tags!  I'll be updating the pull shortly and posting a patch here for reference.

Also done.  It turned out that making it into em is the best way to emulate what is there.

I *did* discover a different issue - it turns out that we probably aren't dealing with line breaks correctly inside of things like strong and em.  In HTML you can have multiple lines inside of such a tag, but just adding a newline doesn't work for this, as ReST treats

```
*Your name
Your email*
```
as one line of text, which is the usual behavior, but

```
*Your name

Your email*
```
is no longer emphasized.  I don't think there is a super-easy way to fix this, and as pointed out above one will always have to do some tweaking of the output.  Making it em for now seems like a good option, and I've fixed the `br` tag to have two newlines.  I didn't fix it in the pre and math cases because those are working ok as they have a different role with the indentation and all.

> > >  * Still to check that regex, though apparently it's working fine
 
Okay, I did my best to mess with it, but I think that the only things it won't do correctly wouldn't look very good in a Sage worksheet anyway, so they would be user errors (like `\$$x$$` and the like).


> > >  * Make an updated pull request for sagenb (luckily not a problem with respect to rebasing, since we only add new files)
 
> Shouldn't be a problem, probably one of the sagenb folks can help with this as well.
I just updated my pull request with Pablo's second patch as well as my own extra patch, so we are there!

I think that the **only** thing that has to be done is, at most, for Pablo to confirm that my change to the br tag is okay.  It's too late for me to check this with actual worksheets today.

Huh, I didn't consider running tests since this is upstream and why would we be running upstream tests?  ;-)

I won't have time to fix this immediately.  But maybe I can try to do a pull request "manually" on github.   As you can see, all the text failures are due to an additional space and extra newlines which I didn't think to check, so easy to fix.

I don't know whether we should really put the optional EVERYwhere.   I guess we can.

I don't see the need to make beautifulsoup standard, though; it's only needed for this one thing, and the import error is pretty informative.

Do you mean you can reproduce the error I get on this sws?
I attach another one, completely trivial.

In a way, it's not a real error, it's just an error message; I get all the files created as they should.

Well, it could be the new sagenb spkg and the new Sage release (5.10.rc1).
