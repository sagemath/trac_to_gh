At [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cd05585cf395b3a0/a34f04f32d68e525), the question was raised whether it really is a good idea that the gcd in the rational field should return either `0` or `1`.

Since *any* non-zero element of `QQ` qualifies as gcd of two non-zero rationals, it should be possible to define gcd and lcm, so that `gcd(x,y)*lcm(x,y)==x*y` holds for any rational numbers x,y, and so that `gcd(QQ(m),QQ(n))==gcd(m,n)` and `lcm(QQ(m),QQ(n))==lcm(m,n)` for any two integers m,n.

Moreover, it should be possible to provide gcd/lcm for any fraction field of a `PID`: Note that currently gcd raises a type error for elements of `Frac(QQ['x'])`.

The aim is to implement gcd and lcm as `ElementMethods` of the category `QuotientFields()`.

**__Approach__**

Let R be an integral domain, assume that it provides gcd and lcm, and let F be its fraction field. Since R has gcd, we can assume that `x.numerator()` and `x.denominator()` are relatively prime for any element x of F.

Then, define

```
gcd(x,y) = gcd(x.numerator(),y.numerator())/lcm(x.denominator(),y.denominator())
lcm(x,y) = lcm(x.numerator(),y.numerator())/gcd(x.denominator(),y.denominator())
```

**__Benefits__**

If that approach is mathematically sober, we obtain the following equalities up to units in R:

* `gcd(x,y)*lcm(x,y)==x*y`, for any x,y in F, provided that the equality holds for any x,y in R.
* `gcd(F(x),F(y))==gcd(x,y)` and `lcm(F(x),F(y))==lcm(x,y)` for any x,y in R.

A couple of comments:

* I don't see the point of keeping a special function `gcd_rational(self, other, **kwds):` that returns a GCD in the set {0,1}. Why only for QQ? Why at all? Also, the difference between `gcd` and `gcd_rational` is not explained by the word "rational". Perhaps `gcd_zero_one` would be a more informative name.

* Everything generalizes from principal ideal domains to unique factorization domains (UFD's) (such as multivariate polynomial rings over unique factorization domains) as long as they have `gcd` and `lcm` methods implemented. Why not write "unique factorization domain" in the documentation instead of "principal ideal domain"?

* Suppose I have a fraction field F of a ring of type R that does not have lcm and gcd methods, or these methods exist, but raise other kinds of errors, e.g. because the ring is not a UFD or the methods have not been implemented. Let a and b be elements of F. Then a and b have a gcd in F because F is a field, so I would expect a.gcd(b) to return something (anything basically).

Hi Marco,

Replying to [@mstreng](#comment:3):
> A couple of comments:
> 
> * I don't see the point of keeping a special function `gcd_rational(self, other, **kwds):` that returns a GCD in the set {0,1}. Why only for QQ? Why at all? Also, the difference between `gcd` and `gcd_rational` is not explained by the word "rational". Perhaps `gcd_zero_one` would be a more informative name.

Perhaps I am too 'conservative': I would rather rename something than to delete it.

But I suppose it would be better to implement a gcd and an lcm as element methods of `Fields()` -- see #9819. In that way, one could easily provide a correct gcd/lcm behaviour for all fields, and for fraction fields of PID one would still obtain a gcd/lcm behaviour that is not only correct but nice.

> * Everything generalizes from principal ideal domains to unique factorization domains (UFD's) (such as multivariate polynomial rings over unique factorization domains) as long as they have `gcd` and `lcm` methods implemented. Why not write "unique factorization domain" in the documentation instead of "principal ideal domain"?

Good question. I did it by accident. However, it matches the sad fact that the categories are a little askew here:

```
sage: PrincipalIdealDomains().is_subcategory(UniqueFactorizationDomains())
False  # shouldn't that be "True"?
sage: PrincipalIdealDomains().is_subcategory(GcdDomains())
True
sage: UniqueFactorizationDomains().is_subcategory(GcdDomains())
True
```

Perhaps one should write "fraction field of an integral domain with gcd and lcm"? Because that's what is duck typed.

> * Suppose I have a fraction field F of a ring of type R that does not have lcm and gcd methods, or these methods exist, but raise other kinds of errors, e.g. because the ring is not a UFD or the methods have not been implemented. Let a and b be elements of F. Then a and b have a gcd in F because F is a field, so I would expect a.gcd(b) to return something (anything basically). After applying your patch, if I do `a.gcd(b)`, it is very confusing to get an `AttributeError: 'RElement' object has no attribute 'gcd'`: I'm not interested in gcd's of RElements, only of `(Fraction)FieldElements`. You could put your entire `gcd` and `lcm` code between `try:` and `except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError, TypeError, ValueError):` to return the same 0 or 1 that `gcd_rational` would (which is a mathematically correct gcd in F after all).

If one adds a gcd and lcm for field elements (#9819) returning 0 or 1, then your suggestion certainly makes sense.

Thanks! I am about to post a new patch, and I hope that Luis as author of #9819 does not mind if I add the case of arbitrary fields to my patch.

I just updated my patch, and I hope it addresses all your remarks. The typos are fixed, the old gcd of the rational field is now removed, and: I also added gcd/lcm for general fields. I am sorry that this makes #9819 a duplicate.

And I hope that I did not confuse gcd and lcm in the following setting:

```
sage: GF(2)(1).gcd(GF(2)(1))
1
sage: GF(2)(1).gcd(GF(2)(0))
1
sage: GF(2)(0).gcd(GF(2)(0))
0
sage: GF(2)(1).lcm(GF(2)(0))
0
sage: GF(2)(1).lcm(GF(2)(1))
1
```
That's implemented as element methods for the category of `Fields()`. Somehow, the category framework is cool, isn't it?

New complaints, sorry.

* I don't really like this:

   ```
   sage: M = Matrix(GF(3),2,2,[1,2,0,1]); M
   [1 2]
   [0 1]
   sage: GF(2)(1).lcm(M)
   1
  ```
  I think you should first try to coerce other to self.parent() in gcd and lcm for Field elements.

* Line 64 of quotient_fields.py "`both GCD and LCM, it is possible to be a bit more specific`"
  uses capital letters GCD and LCM, while the methods that it (quasi-)refers to are lower case:
  `AttributeError: 'sage.rings.rational.Rational' object has no attribute 'GCD'`

* Next line: "define the GCD uniquely up to a unit in the base ring". Write "of" instead of "in"
  so that it is clear that you are not saying that the GCD is in the base ring.

* Your tests with `R.<q> = ZZ.extension(x^2+5)` is unrelated to fraction field: q is 1

   ```
   sage: R.<q> = ZZ.extension(x^2+5)
   sage: g = R.gens(); g
   [1, q]
   sage: q
   1
   sage: g[1]
   q
   sage: g[1] == q
   False
  ```
  All your examples involving q get coerced to ZZ by the global GCD and LCM, so you should
  find other examples. This seems to work:

   ```
   sage: gcd(g[1],1)
   TypeError: unable to find gcd of q and 1
   sage: gcd(g[1]/1,1)
   1
  ```
  (Correct behaviour both times)

Time to catch a bus, may have more comments later.

I do not full understand this, but I am happy that works.

Some thoughts:

For QQ and the like, could it be that gcd and lcm should only take care of coercing to a good setting and then the real algorithm should be in _lcm, _gcd? Note that QQ already has ._gcd and ._lcm so these methods has to be taken into account.

Hi Luis!

Replying to [@lftabera](#comment:11):
> > That's implemented as element methods for the category of `Fields()`. Somehow, the category framework is cool, isn't it?

> 
> I do not full understand this, but I am happy that works.

Then let me explain:

Any category (in Sage) comes with a parent class and an "element class". That very often is an abstract thing, but you can inherit from it, and in particular you can implement methods for it.

If things are properly done, then a parent P is declared as an object in some category, and its class *automatically(!)* inherits from the parent class of its category:

```
sage: QQ.__class__
<class 'sage.rings.rational_field.RationalField_with_category'>
sage: issubclass(QQ.__class__,QuotientFields().parent_class)
True
```

If things are very properly done, then the parent has an attribute `Element`, which is supposed to be a class. That class will (again automatically) be translated into a subclass of the element class of the parent's category, and is available as the attribute `element_class`:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(2),[[1]])
sage: G = MatrixGroup([m])
sage: G.Element
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.matrix_group_element.MatrixGroupElement'>
sage: G.__class__
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.matrix_group.MatrixGroup_gens_finite_field_with_category'>
sage: G.element_class
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.matrix_group_element.MatrixGroup_gens_finite_field_with_category.element_class'>
sage: issubclass(G.element_class,G.Element)
True
sage: issubclass(G.element_class,G.category().element_class)
True
sage: isinstance(G.random_element(),G.category().element_class)
True
```

So, if things are very properly done, then a method defined as an "element method" of a category, will be available by looking up the method resolution order, since the elements of the parent are actual instances of the category's element class.

Sometimes things are done properly, but not *very* properly:

```
sage: QQ.category()
Category of quotient fields
sage: isinstance(QQ, QQ.category().parent_class)
True
sage: hasattr(QQ,'Element')
False
sage: isinstance(QQ.one(), QQ.category().element_class)
False
```

Hence, the methods that I defined for the element class of the "category of quotient fields" is not available to elements of `QQ` by simply looking up the method resolution order. But: There also is a `__getattr__` method implemented for `sage.structure.element.Element`, and this can access the element methods of the category of the parent of an element (uff!) even if the element is no instance of the "proper" element class.

This is why the new gcd works for the rationals, but it's slower than with the method resolution order, and this is why I also did not remove the existing lcm for rationals.

> Some thoughts:
> 
> For QQ and the like, could it be that gcd and lcm should only take care of coercing to a good setting and then the real algorithm should be in _lcm, _gcd? Note that QQ already has ._gcd and ._lcm so these methods has to be taken into account.

That's a nice observation. By searching a little, I found that `_gcd` is used in the method `sage.structure.element.PrincipalIdealDomainElement.gcd`. 

However, there are only very few classes that define a `_gcd` method: `sage.structure.element.EuclideanDomainElement`, `sage.structure.element.FieldElement`, `sage.rings.rational.Rational`, and then there are hits in `...polynomial_element_generic` and `...polynomial_modn_dense_ntl`.

In other words, I guess that the `_gcd` method is an artefact of earlier attempts to reflect mathematics in the class hierarchy -- this should now be done in the category framework. `_gcd` will *only* play a role if 

1. the class of an element derives from `PrincipalIdealDomainElement`, and

2. the class of an element additionally defines `_gcd`.

It seems to me that there is precisely one class that directly inherits from `PrincipalIdealDomainElement`, and there is precisely one class that directly inherits from that class:

```
sage: search_src("\(PrincipalIdealDomainElement")
structure/element.pxd:83:cdef class EuclideanDomainElement(PrincipalIdealDomainElement):
structure/element.pyx:2370:cdef class EuclideanDomainElement(PrincipalIdealDomainElement):

sage: search_src("\(EuclideanDomainElement")
structure/element.pyx:2362:PY_SET_TP_NEW(EuclideanDomainElement, Element)
rings/integer.pxd:9:cdef class Integer(EuclideanDomainElement):
```

So, `_gcd` is only used for the `Integer` class. I guess it could easily be removed.

> For generic Fields, It should appear in the documentation that the methods return 0 if both arguments are zero and a non-zero element otherwise. The user should not suppose that the non-zero element is actually one, since this is changed by subclasses.

Right. I'll take care of that, but now I have a bus to catch...

Anyway, the failure in "expression.pyx" seems to be related with the patch. I'll try to understand what is happening.

I thought of it as a comment to people who know the original code. It could be that it is a method that uses gcd only internally, so that commenting in the code seems better than in the documentation.

>   And I think junk like the following should not be in the code at all: `  #,integer=self.parent() is ZZ) `

OK, that was an artefact of editing.

But I think most urgent are the doctest failures. It seems related to gcd for fields that are not fraction fields (such as `RR`). That would also explain why all text passed with the original version of my patch, whereas the new version fails.

Cheers,
Simon

Yep, I understand where the first error comes from.

The original gcd codes says:

```
    if b is not None:
        if hasattr(a, "gcd"):
            return a.gcd(b, **kwargs)
        else:
            try:
                return ZZ(a).gcd(ZZ(b))
            except TypeError:
                raise TypeError, "unable to find gcd of %s and %s"%(a,b)
```
Moreover, elements of `RR` did not have a gcd method. Hence, it was tried to coerce them into ZZ, and so we had

```
sage: gcd(3.0,6.0)
3
```

But with my patch, *all* field elements (including elements of `RR`) have a gcd method, so, a conversion to `ZZ` is not attempted.

I am not sure yet how I would solve it: Change the code of `sage.symbolic.expression"? Change the gcd implemented for fields that are no fraction fields, such that a special case is made for inexact fields?

I suggest to do the following, which would generalize the current attempt to convert stuff into `ZZ`:

```
            For inexact fields, evaluation in the prime subfield is attempted::

                sage: lcm(15.2,12.0); lcm(15.2,12.0).parent()
                228
                Rational Field
                sage: RR(76/5)
                15.2000000000000
                sage: lcm(76/5,12)
                228

            If this fails, we resort to the default we see above::

                sage: lcm(6.0*CC.0,8*CC.0); lcm(6.0*CC.0,8*CC.0).parent()
                1.00000000000000
                Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Similarly for gcd.

In that way, the first of the three doctest failures vanishes. But the other two remain problems.

```
With patch

With the new patch, all tests pass for me. The behaviour is now (mutatis mutandis for lcm):

* If `ZZ` is a subring of a field F that is not a fraction field then `a.gcd(b)` first tests if a and b can be converted into `ZZ`. If it is the case, their gcd in `ZZ` *as element of `ZZ`* is returned. This is not nice, but it is compatible with the "unpatched" behaviour of Sage and is assumed in some other parts of Sage:

 ```
 # unpatched!
 sage: gcd(RR(1),RR(1))
 1
 sage: _.parent()
 Integer Ring
 ```

* If `ZZ` is no subring of F or conversion fails then `a.gcd(b)` returns `F(0)` or `F(1)`. This is, e.g., the case for `gcd(CC(2),CC(2))`, since `CC(2)` can not be converted into `ZZ`.

* a.gcd(b) only raises an error if `b` can not be converted into `a.parent()`.

* gcd and lcm in fraction fields of a unique factorization domain R restrict to R, and moreover they satisfy `gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b)==a*b` up to multiplication with a unit of R.

There is a price to pay, and that's why I put Burcin on Cc:

The distribution of minus signs in symbolic expression changes, apparently since now gcd raises no errors in examples like the following:

```

The question is whether a changed minus sign distribution is such a serious thing.

Done.

You are right. My intention was to *start* with `R`, show that there is no gcd in R, and then expose what happens in `Frac(R)`. The test is changed accordingly.

What happens with the already existing doctests?  That would be what I would be most concerned about.  Also, is the infinite loop now gone?  IIRC you had fixed that somehow.

Really, in some sense the new version is 'better' because it keeps the minus where the user put it.  Do `(-I - 1/3*sqrt(2))^2` and `(I + 1/3*sqrt(2))^2` do anything different from before?

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment:23):
> What happens with the already existing doctests?  That would be what I would be most concerned about. 

There are two tests (really in fact only one) in `sage.stats` where I had to change the expected output. The old and new output are equivalent:

```
sage: std([I, sqrt(2), 3/5]) # result with patch
sqrt(1/450*(-5*sqrt(2) + 10*I - 3)^2 + 1/450*(-5*sqrt(2) - 5*I + 6)^2 + 1/450*(10*sqrt(2) - 5*I - 3)^2)
# Without patch, we had sqrt(1/450*(5*sqrt(2) + 5*I - 6)^2 + 1/450*(5*sqrt(2) - 10*I + 3)^2 + 1/450*(10*sqrt(2) - 5*I - 3)^2)
# Testing equality:
sage: bool(sqrt(1/450*(5*sqrt(2) + 5*I - 6)^2 + 1/450*(5*sqrt(2) - 10*I + 3)^2 + 1/450*(10*sqrt(2) - 5*I - 3)^2) == std([I, sqrt(2), 3/5]))
True
```
There is essentially the same happening with `variance([I, sqrt(2), 3/5])`.

> Also, is the infinite loop now gone?  IIRC you had fixed that somehow.

Yep. The problem was that in an old version of my patch I would not try conversion to `ZZ` but conversion to the prime subfield. A real number with finitely many digits can of course *always* be converted into `RR.prime_subfield()`, which is `QQ`. So, I guess that the segfault came from rationals with very large numerator and denominator. Here is the proof that the segfault has gone:

```
sage: F(x) = 1/sqrt(2*pi*1^2)*exp(-1/(2*1^2)*(x-0)^2) 
sage: G(x) = 1/sqrt(2*pi*n(1)^2)*exp(-1/(2*n(1)^2)*(x-n(0))^2) 
sage: (F-G)**2 
x |--> 1/4*(sqrt(2)*e^(-1/2*x^2)/sqrt(pi) - 1.41421356237309*e^(-0.500000000000000*x^2)/sqrt(pi))^2
```
which coincides with the answer of unpatched Sage.

> Really, in some sense the new version is 'better' because it keeps the minus where the user put it.  Do `(-I - 1/3*sqrt(2))^2` and `(I + 1/3*sqrt(2))^2` do anything different from before?

They do.

```
sage: (-I - 1/3*sqrt(2))^2
1/9*(-sqrt(2) - 3*I)^2
# Was: 1/9*(sqrt(2) + 3*I)^2
sage: (I + 1/3*sqrt(2))^2
1/9*(sqrt(2) + 3*I)^2
# Was: 1/9*(sqrt(2) + 3*I)^2
```

Really I don't understand where that comes from. Namely, as far as I know, the sign of gcd or lcm did not change. The only difference in gcd/lcm examples involving `I` and `sqrt(2)` is the fact that without my patch an error would be raised.

Yes,

```
sage: gcd(I + 1/3*sqrt(2),I + 1/3*sqrt(2))

Interesting.  Like I said earlier, Sage now sends such symbolic things to Pynac/Ginac, which however needs to use Sage again in order to do certain calculations like this (Mike Hansen explained it well in your thread on sage-devel).  So apparently in the past it decided to factor out a -1 in certain cases based on some gcd - maybe just a default of 1 or something - whereas now it does not, due to the new gcd.  What does 

```
sage: gcd(I + 1/3*sqrt(2),I + 1/3*sqrt(2))
```
do after the patch?  What happens with this?

```
sage: gcd(4,2+2*I*sqrt(3))
```
Notice that I am purposely taking two things NOT in a polynomial or extension thing, where it can be calculated whether it's a UFD.  In the symbolic ring, who knows what's "right"?

I think I've figured out hg queues now, so I can actually try out the patch!  [No guarantees, though.]  Was fuzz-testing it and noticed the following:

```
sage: var("x")
x
sage: a = 1/3*x**0
sage: b = 2/5*x**0
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: gcd(a,b)
1/15
sage: lcm(a,b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   1563             except TypeError:

   1565         return LCM(b)
   1566 

TypeError: unable to find lcm of 1/3 and 2/5
```

All bets are off in SR, but there is an Expression.gcd (no .lcm, strangely).  Now that QQ reduces to ZZ, maybe switch the attempt to try ZZ to QQ, so that rationals Just Work(tm)?

This surprised me a little too:

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: 
sage: a = 1/3*x**0
sage: b = 2/5*x**0
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint'>
sage: gcd(a,b), lcm(a,b)
(1, 1)
sage: 
sage: a = (1*x**0)/(3*x**0)
sage: b = (2*x**0)/(5*x**0)
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement_1poly_field'>
sage: gcd(a,b), lcm(a,b)
(1, 1)
```

given that the seemingly harder cases

```
sage: a = 1/3+x
sage: b = 2/5+x
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint'>
sage: gcd(a,b), lcm(a,b), a*b-gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b)
(1, x^2 + 11/15*x + 2/15, 0)
sage: 
sage: a = (1*x**0)/(3*x**0)+x
sage: b = (2*x**0)/(5*x**0)+x
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement_1poly_field'>
sage: gcd(a,b), lcm(a,b), a*b-gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b)
(1, x^2 + 11/15*x + 2/15, 0)
```

behave a little nicer.  Is it possible to recover the rational results?

I seem to recall it passed just fine but I can't find the output now `:-(` so I'm rerunning them (takes me about ~3h).

Following was's recommendations (http://ask.sagemath.org/question/31/should-i-_really_-review-trac-tickets) I don't think I've got enough experience with the Sage codebase yet to set something to positive review; I'm still finding my way around.
