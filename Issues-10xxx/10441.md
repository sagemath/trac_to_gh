}
```
In SAGE 4.5.1 if you try to create an empty graph or digraph using the multi-edge keyword the (di)graph created is a non-multi (di)graph.

Examples of the strange behaviour:

```
sage: G=Graph(multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: G=Graph([],multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph(multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph([],multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

Nevertheless it works fine, i.e. produces a multi-graph/multi-digraph if one uses an empty dictionary like in the following:

```
sage: G=Graph({},multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Multi-graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph({},multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Multi-digraph on 0 vertices
```

After posting on sage-develop **Strange behaviour of add_edges** [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/69773eae8ba3cefc](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/69773eae8ba3cefc) I was asked to open a new ticket...

I think that having **kwds in the Graph constructor is very confusing, because any misspelling of an argument pass through without notice. Do you see some serious reason why is this there? I'm looking into the code and can't see anything.

Hellooooooooooooo !!

Well, the code building the graph is a bit messy but indeed what you wrote 1) prevents the bug 2) is what we should do until somebody comes with another weird situation `:-)`

Would it be possible to move your "# not a multi [...]" comments to the line just above the test, though ? That's where we put flags like "optional" or "not tested" for the automatic tests, and it's best to be sure these comments do not interfere `^^;`
