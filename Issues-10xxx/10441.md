In SAGE 4.5.1 if you try to create an empty graph or digraph using the multi-edge keyword the (di)graph created is a non-multi (di)graph.

Examples of the strange behaviour:

```
sage: G=Graph(multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: G=Graph([],multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph(multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph([],multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

Nevertheless it works fine, i.e. produces a multi-graph/multi-digraph if one uses an empty dictionary like in the following:

```
sage: G=Graph({},multiple_edges=True)
sage: G
Multi-graph on 0 vertices
```

```
sage: H=DiGraph({},multiple_edges=True)
sage: H
Multi-digraph on 0 vertices
```

After posting on sage-develop **Strange behaviour of add_edges** [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/69773eae8ba3cefc](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/69773eae8ba3cefc) I was asked to open a new ticket...

Well, the code building the graph is a bit messy but indeed what you wrote 1) prevents the bug 2) is what we should do until somebody comes with another weird situation `:-)`

Would it be possible to move your "# not a multi [...]" comments to the line just above the test, though ? That's where we put flags like "optional" or "not tested" for the automatic tests, and it's best to be sure these comments do not interfere `^^;`
