I tried testing this patch (and its addendum) on sage 4.6.2, and this doctest failed:

```

```

However, after applying patch #10799, which fixes `.resultant()` and `.discriminant()` for univariate polynomials over polynomial rings, the doctest passes. So I think that is more the PARI polynomial issue addressed in #10799.

I therefore suggest mentioning that #10844 is dependent on #10799. Also, you might need to recenter the patch, since both affect sage/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx.

Contingent on applying the above patch first, the code checks out and passes all tests I threw at it. Once you've recentered it I can give it a positive review.
