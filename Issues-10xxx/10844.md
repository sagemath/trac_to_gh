In docstring: The variable with respect we compute the discriminant -> "with respect to which"?

Added a new patch (to be aplied over the first one). Solves the problems in the documentation and the zero element. It also solves the problem with the zero element for the univariate case.

I tried testing this patch (and its addendum) on sage 4.6.2, and this doctest failed:

```

```

However, after applying patch #10799, which fixes `.resultant()` and `.discriminant()` for univariate polynomials over polynomial rings, the doctest passes. So I think that is more the PARI polynomial issue addressed in #10799.

I therefore suggest mentioning that #10844 is dependent on #10799. Also, you might need to recenter the patch, since both affect sage/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx.

Contingent on applying the above patch first, the code checks out and passes all tests I threw at it. Once you've recentered it I can give it a positive review.
