In this patch truncated multiplication of dense polynomials is
used in `PowerSeries_poly` multiplication.

in Sage-4.6 on my computer with Intel Core i7 2.8GHz

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: K.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(R)
sage: time p1 = (1 + a*t + b*t^2 + O(t^50))^-40
Wall time: 7.62s
```

with this patch it takes 0.12s
The speed-up increases with the number of variables and with the precision.

Apply: trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication-alternative.patch

Could you please check if the changes of #10255 in karatsuba multiplication provide further improvement?

PowerSeries are constructed over commutative rings, but polynomial_elements do not. Hence mul_trunc needs to work also over noncommutative rings. It does not right now (al least lines 5342 and 5345 do not differenciate between left and right multiplication).

I see several improvements:

I think that 

cdef int i, j, a1len, a2len, n1, n2, ih

in line 5334 should be Py_ssize_t, but maybe a cython expert should look at this.

c = [0]*h in line 5346 of the patch is inefficient in several cases. One of the most contributions in 10480 is to avoid python 0 'int' in the code, that can be (relatively) expensive to coerce. I guess that this code will be slow if the base ring is a number field (that has slow coercion).

The last loop is classical multiplication up to the precision required. I wonder if part of that multiplication could use do_karatsuba or a truncated_do_karatsuba.

Some more numbers with your patch showing what I said on my previous post.
Patch aginst a clean sage 4.6

with patch:

```
sage: K.<t>=QQ['a'][]
sage: p1 = K.random_element(800) + O(t^990)
sage: p2 = K.random_element(800) + O(t^990)
sage: %time _=p1*p2
CPU times: user 6.09 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 6.17 s
Wall time: 6.49 s
```

without patch

```
sage: sage: K.<t>=QQ['a'][]
sage: sage: p1 = K.random_element(800) + O(t^990)
sage: sage: p2 = K.random_element(800) + O(t^990)
sage: sage: %time _=p1*p2
CPU times: user 3.24 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 3.27 s
Wall time: 3.39 s
```

I think that we can define an algorithm that works like karatsuba but that has a prec parameter. If a portion will have order greater than the prec. That part is discarded.
The prec is updated on recursive calls.

I will try to implement the algorithm at "A long note on Muldersâ€™ short product" of Hanrot and Zimmermann that looks not harder than Karatsuba. The authors claim that heuristically the gain time is on the average 0.7 x Karatsuba time.

Also, the following cases have to be correctly covered:

```
sage: O(x)*O(x)
0
sage: O(x^2)*O(x^3)

I followed your suggestion to perform truncated multiplication recursively,
keeping track of the precision, calling Karatsuba multiplication
when there are no truncations.

>Also, the following cases have to be correctly covered:

```
sage: O(x)*O(x)
0
sage: O(x^2)*O(x^3)
0
```

The new patch trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication2.patch passes all tests, included these.
It performs generally better than the unpached Sage4.6,
except the case in which the series has degree lower than the precision,
like your example

```
p1 = K.random_element(800) + O(t^990)
```

on which it is typically up to 50% slower, while with the previous
patch it was 2x slower.

The first patch was also slow in other cases, see below.

The performance of truncated multiplication vs Karatsuba multiplication
depends on the distribution of the terms in the univariate series;
truncated multiplication is fast when the high powers in the univariate
variable t have many more terms than the low powers, like in this example

using this patch:

```
sage: from sage.rings.power_series_poly import PowerSeries_poly
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: K.<t> = R[]
sage: p = (1 + a*t + b*t^2 + O(t^50))^-1
sage: v = [len(x.coefficients()) for x in p.coefficients()]
sage: v[:6], v[-6:]
([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], [23, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25])
sage: %timeit p*p
25 loops, best of 3: 26 ms per loop
sage: %timeit PowerSeries_poly(p.parent(),p.polynomial().mul_trunc(p.polynomial(),50,1),50)
125 loops, best of 3: 4.89 ms per loop
sage: p*p - PowerSeries_poly(p.parent(),p.polynomial().mul_trunc(p.polynomial(),50,1),50)
O(t^50)
```

unpached Sage (main): 

```
sage: %timeit p*p
5 loops, best of 3: 833 ms per loop
```

`mul_trunc(self, right, h, generic=1)`  calls `do_mul_trunc_generic`, which
is the algorithm used in the first patch; in this case it is faster,
but in other cases it is slower, so I think it is better to use `do_mul_trunc`.
However in multivariate series `do_mul_trunc_generic` seems to perform always
better; I will post a patch about this in ticket #1956

```
p = K.random_element(50) + O(t^50) 
```

has uniform distribution; for `p*p` the patched version performs as the main version.


In un.sage one takes N subsequent `p=p*(p+1)` starting with a
random univariate series on a polynomial ring with n variables;
the ratio of the number of terms in the upper half of the univariate series
and the lower half is given.
The ratio is close to 1 in a random polynomial, and increases with n and N.
There is a correlation between the speedup
using truncated multiplication and this ratio.
The old patch (patch1) in some cases performs badly; the worst case is given.

```

N = number of times p = p*(p+1) is taken

In the last example I stopped the computation with main because too much
memory was used.

> I will try to implement the algorithm at "A long note on Muldersâ€™ short product" of Hanrot and Zimmermann that looks not harder than Karatsuba. The authors claim that heuristically the gain time is on the average 0.7 x Karatsuba time.

If I understand correctly, that paper deals with univariate series
on numeric rings. Maybe in the case of univariate series over polynomial
rings one could use the list of the number of elements to guide the
algorithm.

Oops, we have been duplicating work,

I have written a proof of concept of a truncated Karatsuba to check that it derives a correct algorithm. It is much much slower than plain sage. It needs to eliminate unnecesary slicing and calls of type K(f).list()

I will take a look at your patch.

Mario,

This part on your patch

```
zeros = [0] * e 
t0 = do_mul_trunc(b,d,h) 
t1a = do_mul_trunc(a,d,h-e) 
t1b = do_mul_trunc(b,c,h-e) 
t1 = zeros + _karatsuba_sum(t1a,t1b) 
t2 = zeros + zeros + do_mul_trunc(a,c,h-2*e) 
return _karatsuba_sum(t0,_karatsuba_sum(t1,t2)) 
```

Is inefficient, 2/3 of the operations in this part is adding a ring element with python zero. This was included in original do_karatsuba and was the reason to rewrite it in #10255.

I get the following numbers with the patches:

```
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: K.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(R)
sage: time p1 = (1 + a*t + b*t^2 + O(t^50))^-40
```

No patch: 8.92

multiplication2: 0.66

alternative: 0.45

```
sage: K.<x>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ[I])
sage: p1 = K.random_element(800)
sage: p2 = K.random_element(800)
```

No patch: 1.59

#10255: 0.24

Right, one can always use your Karatsuba code; in the case of multivariate
series it seems to me that the best value for K_threshold is infinity.
I have posted some benchmarks in #10532; I have no idea why,
but the case K_threshold =infinity and classical multiplication
perform the same for QQ and GF(7), while the former performs much better
than the latter in the case of RR; I guess that this might generalize to
the statement that the former performs much better than the latter in the
case of (a class of) fields not covered by libsingular.

I do not think that optimizing the code to avoid summing to Python 0
would change much the performance of do_mul_trunc,
since that part of the code takes little time.
I think that do_trunc_karatsuba is faster than do_mul_trunc
because in the former there is a clever split

```
left_even  = left[::2]; left_odd   = left[1::2] 
```
corresponding to
separating the polynomial `p(t)` in `p_even(t^2)` and `t*p_odd(t^2)`
so that the precision `prec` in `t` is reduced to the precision `n1=(prec+1)//2` in `t^2`

```
l = do_trunc_karatsuba(left_even, right_even, n1, K_threshold)
```
while in the latter b and d are the polynomials reduced to `O(t^e)`,
with `e` close to `prec//2`, so that the product is done at full precision

```
t0 = do_mul_trunc(b,d,h), with h = prec.
```

The middle products in the two cases are comparable.

Maybe you could add a comment about the splitting in do_trunc_karatsuba?
Also there is in the docstring of do_generic_product the misprint `bellow` .

I made some experiments and Mulder's algorithm is generally worse and when it is better, the gain is residual so I go back to my first proposal.

Note that the underlying series in #10532 are rather special, so this method as is is not the best for that case.

Have you looked at the implementation of Karatsuba and SchÃ¶nhage-Strassen in GMP-ECM? Quote:

GMP-ECM features SchÃ¶nhage-Strassen multiplication for polynomials in 
stage 2 when factoring Fermat numbers (not in the new, fast stage 2 for
P+1 and P-1. This is to be implemented.) This greatly reduces the number of 
modular multiplications required, thus improving speed. It does, however, 
restrict the length of the polynomials to powers of two, so that for a given 
number of blocks (-k parameter), the B2 value can only increase by factors of 
approximately 4.
For the number of blocks, choices of 2, 3 or 4 usually give best performance.
However, if the polynomial degree becomes too large, relatively expensive
Karatsuba or Toom-Coom methods are required to split the polynomial before
SchÃ¶nhage-Strassen's method can handle them. That can make a larger number 
of blocks worthwhile. ...

I'm new to this ticket, thus please forgive me if some comments are out of scope.

About Mulders' algorithm, using a fixed cutoff point k = 25/36*n is not optimal in
practice, where it is better to tune the best k for each n (up to say n=1024) as we do in GNU MPFR.

Since truncated (polynomial) multiplication is potentially useful in other parts of Sage, it would make sense to have the code implementing truncated multiplication and the one using it for power series in two different tickets, no?

We do have now truncated multiplication on polynomials

```
sage: p = ZZ['x']('x^20 + 3 * x^15 - 2*x + 1')
sage: p._mul_trunc_(p, 4)
4*x^2 - 4*x + 1
```

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A31):

It does depend on the base ring

```
sage: p = ZZ['x'].random_element(degree=20)
sage: %time a = p*p
CPU times: user 31 Âµs, sys: 2 Âµs, total: 33 Âµs
Wall time: 35 Âµs
sage: %time b = p._mul_trunc_(p,8)
CPU times: user 23 Âµs, sys: 1 Âµs, total: 24 Âµs
Wall time: 27.9 Âµs
```
But you are right that the generic version of `_mul_truc_` is nothing more than multiply and truncate.
