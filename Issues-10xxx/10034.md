See #9879, where it is now possible to 'hold' a symbolic expression:

```
sage: a = (pi/12).tan(hold=True)
sage: a
tan(1/12*pi)
```

However, without going through Maxima and `a.simplify()`, it isn't clear how to get the actual answer for this.  Either by changing `simplify()` to try simplifying through Pynac first, or by adding something like an `a.eval()` method, we should make that possible without Maxima.
