See #9879, where it is now possible to 'hold' a symbolic expression:

```
sage: a = (pi/12).tan(hold=True)
sage: a
tan(1/12*pi)
```

However, without going through Maxima and `a.simplify()`, it isn't clear how to get the actual answer for this.  Either by changing `simplify()` to try simplifying through Pynac first, or by adding something like an `a.eval()` method, we should make that possible without Maxima.

This is related to #10071, which is about functions which can't even be evaluated using Maxima or `n()`.  This ticket is saying that one should be able to evaluate all held functions without using Maxima or `n()`, whether or not a function currently can be evaluated in that way or not.
