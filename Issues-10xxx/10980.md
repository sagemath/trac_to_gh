From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/454/can-gridlines-be-painted-at-sqrt2).

```
plot(x,0,2,gridlines=([sqrt(2)],[]))
```
blows up.  

The fix is probably to make sure that symbolic input with a `n()` method passes something right to matplotlib, which of course cannot handle `sqrt(2)`.  Possibly beginner ticket.

Yes, we fix (1) here.  I don't think that (2) necessarily has to be fixed, as long as we're aware of it.   It's presumably been around a while, and we'd have to deprecate it.  Though of course `number_of_operands` is more accurate.

```
sage: f(x)=x^2+1+sin(ln(x))
sage: len(f)
3
```
seems reasonable...

Changing the upstream report.  NA is only if literally NA.  In this case, there were a couple things going on, so not NA; according to the post above, it's fixed but not yet in the bugfix branch i.e. stable release.

This does actually work now, by the way.

```
plot(x,0,2,gridlines=([sqrt(2)],[]))
```
This doesn't resolve the issue of whether symbolic things should have a `len`.

```

    def __len__(self):
        """
        Returns the number of arguments of this expression.

        EXAMPLES::
        
            sage: var('a,b,c,x,y')
            (a, b, c, x, y)
            sage: len(a)
            0
            sage: len((a^2 + b^2 + (x+y)^2))
            3
            sage: len((a^2))
            2
            sage: len(a*b^2*c)
            3
        """
        return self.number_of_operands()
```
But this has been in for at least three years (the Pynac switch).

so, should this go to a *closed* state? or instead go to a *need_work* state? in my opinion it should move to a sage-devel discussion before

The correction is not right, because the second colon needs to come immediately after "trac", not at the end:

```
:trac:`10980`
```
not

```
:trac`10980`:
```
It needs to be done this way so that `sphinx` will make a correct [hyperlink](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#hyperlinks) in the sagemath documentation.
