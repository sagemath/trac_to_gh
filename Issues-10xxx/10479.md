The current support of nef-partitions in Sage is very limited and not very well designed.

The patch provides a new implementation with convenient access to all associated polytopes. It breaks backward compatibility for nef-partitions, but it is very unlikely that anyone could seriously use the present version.

In principle, it is ready, but there are some issues building documentation, I'll resolve them shortly.

The patch looks big, but half of it is documentation and the other half doctests adjustments ;-)

OK, the documentation builds and look fine.

Interactive help for `NefPartition?` in the notebook is not so great: the second $i$ in the input description is not recognized for some reason and the pretty aligned block of polytopes shows

```
Unknown control sequence '\['
```
This is due to `\\[1ex]`, removing `[1ex]` would display all four equations on the same line. Everything looks great if I replace `\\` with `\\\`, but then the HTML documentation does not build and it is wrong from LaTeX/Sphinx point of view anyway. Instead of figuring out workarounds, I propose merging this patch in its current version and opening documentation-related tickets to fix these general issues.

On the command line `NefPartition?` also has the problem with $i$ and the displayed block is rendered completely ununderstandable with some inequalities creeping in. Again, I claim that this is a general documentation problem that should be solved elsewhere. Meanwhile all definitions are given in the text anyway in a readable form, it just would be nice to have the displayed block in addition.

**Attachment:** [trac_10479_nef_partitions_rewrite.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10479/trac_10479_nef_partitions_rewrite.patch.gz)

I tried to clarify options of `nef_partitions`.

I also replaced `\\[1ex]` with `\\ & \\` to make "just a blank line" but keep four equations aligned together. This works fine for the compiled HTML documentation and the interactive help in the notebook does not produce an error. It does not look as it should however, because the documentation parser incorrectly processes slashes. Command line help also does not look good, but no surprise here. My opinion is that I am using correct and appropriate formatting, so it is not my bug if the result does not look as expected.

Playing with

```
def g():
    r"""
    1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2
    
    plain text
    
    1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2

    ``code``
        
    1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 2        
    """
    pass
g?
```
in the notebook shows that slashes are fine as long as there is no code or math insertions, but ones there is one - the original number of slashes somehow decreases despite of "r" in the beginning of the string.

Why *none*?
* HTML from Sphynx looks great!
* In the notebook all equations now also appear in a clear way but on one line and with a little bit weird spacing.
