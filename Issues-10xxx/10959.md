For example, 

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph()
sage: bg.add_edge(0,1)
sage: bg.left
set([])
sage: bg.right
set([])
```

Note that we can't really tell in general what the proper partitions for these new vertices are.  We can if *one* exists already.  The easy out in the former case is to throw an error.

There was some previous discussion about deciding partitions automatically.  Volunteers are welcome.  In the mean time, we should at least throw an error to avoid an invalid state.

I think this is much simpler problem than #8744 -- no computationally expensive step is required to automatically add new vertex or vertices to the partitions.

Hmmmmm `^^;`

Methinks this class really is a mess, but you did what made the most sense in this context `^^;`

Good to go ! Thank you for this patch ! `:-)`
