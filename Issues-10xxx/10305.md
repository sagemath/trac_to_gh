Here is some preliminary code to implement the center of the symmetric group algebras, various bases for this and related rings, and coercions between these and to/from the ring of symmetric functions.

Work issues:
* Re-architecting in progress
* Fix the performance of conversion from SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenter to SymmetricGroupAlgebra
* Add the new files (and possibly some old ones?) to the reference manual
* Possibly add the option of saving some of the conversion tables to disk, as they can be large and expensive to compute.

Note that this depends on #7980 and #10304.

Hey Mathieu,

Replying to [@mguaypaq](#comment%3A4):

I'd be happy to write a review patch and add in the documentation.

There has also be a very substantial rewrite of the symmetric functions and we would likely be able to lift some code (or at least the implementation concepts) from there.

It would be nice for a colleague of mine to have a working version of this in sage. Right now he's looking into Schur rings in Z(CC[S_n]) as they come up in supercharacter theory and this patch would be useful. I'm happy to help where I can to get this working.

Hey Matthieu,

Here's everything that I could do with the patch. I've reworked it to use the same framework as the symmetric functions, allowed the SGA center for a fixed n, and added in coercions to the SGA when appropriate. However there's three more things I'll need from you:

(Due to the amount of changes by just reorganizing code, I felt it was better to post a new version of the patch than a review patch.)

For reviewing this patch, we'll do a cross-review where I review your changes and you review mine. Sound good?

Hi Travis,

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A11):
> Hey Matthieu,
> 
> Here's everything that I could do with the patch. I've reworked it to use the same framework as the symmetric functions, allowed the SGA center for a fixed n, and added in coercions to the SGA when appropriate.

Great! I'll have a look as you suggest.

> - Could you put in some references for the Farahat-Higman/partial class algebras?

Sure. In the meantime, here's the bibtex from mathscinet for the original paper by Farahat and Higman:

```
@article {MR0103935,
    AUTHOR = {Farahat, H. K. and Higman, G.},
     TITLE = {The centres of symmetric group rings},
   JOURNAL = {Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A},

The partial class algebra is used and described in a recent paper by Féray, but originally defined by Ivanov and Kerov. Both articles are available in English on arXiv, and the mathscinet bibtex is:

Regarding the bound on partitions based on `n`: strictly speaking, in the FH algebra, the basis includes *all* partitions, not just those where `size + length <= n`. If you want to get the center of the symmetric group algebra for a fixed integer `n`, say `n = 4`, then you need to do two things:

1. Start from the Farahat-Higman algebra over `R['t']` with parameter `t`, and specialize `t` to `4`.

Good call.

That works.

 Here is some preliminary code to implement the center of the symmetric group algebras, various bases for this and related rings, and coercions between these and to/from the ring of symmetric functions.
 
-Things that I plan to do:
-* Fill in all of the TODO doctests with actual doctests.
-* Figure out why some of the coercions aren't discovered by the coercion framework. (See the last few examples at the top of the file.)
-* `SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenter` does not actually have a multiplicative identity as currently implemented, so it should probably by in a category other than `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`.
-* Reimplement `ConjugacyClassBasis` and `OrthogonalIdempotentBasis` for a fixed symmetric group over the integers. Then, the conversion table can be cached, the elements can be represented by lists of coefficients (possibly numpy arrays) instead of dictionaries, and faster linear algebra over the integers can be used. This results in massive (several orders of magnitude) speedups.
+Work issues:
+* Re-architecting in progress
+* Fix the performance of conversion from SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenter to SymmetricGroupAlgebra
+* Add the new files (and possibly some old ones?) to the reference manual
 * Possibly add the option of saving some of the conversion tables to disk, as they can be large and expensive to compute.
-* Add the relevant classes to `sage/combinat/all.py`.
 
 Note that this depends on #7980 and #10304.

Hey Mathieu,

I think it would be best to just look at the final version, but the commit messages are helpful. A few quick comments from looking over the branch:

* The `SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenterBases` should be in the other file.
* The references should be formatted like:

```
.. [Name2013] Blah. *I prefer titles in italics when there's no
   math formatting needed*. Other stuff.
```
  Then you can reference them as `[Name2013]_` in any place in any file, i.e. they are global to all of the Sage documentation.
* It should be `.. RUBRIC::` with 2 colons and `.. SEEALSO::` as one word.

I'll make some changes if you don't beat me to them first as I start to work with the new workflow.

Best,

Travis
