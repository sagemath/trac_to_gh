The Q matrix of a QR decomposition should be unitary, hence invertible.  For zero-column trivial cases, this is broken.

```
sage: A = zero_matrix(CDF, 5, 0)
sage: Q, R = A.QR()
sage: Q
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
```

Besides a bugfix this patch will upgrade the documentation to make it clear how this routine works over the complex numbers.  In particular, `SciPy` routines are using a Hermitian inner product - documentation upgrade will reflect that.

Just one change to the code, to return an identity matrix in a trivial case.  Everything else is documentation.  Unfortunately, this file is not included in the documentation (yet).  You can check that it builds without warnings, then look at it in the notebook to verify the contents and appearance.

It's not clear why it happens.  Because on the same machine I have one Sage build where it works, one where it doesn't with the exact same source, but different gcc version.

Does this code use any external libraries (ATLAS comes to mind)?

Thanks, Jeroen.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to this one.

Yes, this uses SciPy, which in turn will use ATLAS.  It seems a 2-dimensional eigenspace is being returned with different basis vectors.

This is mostly a documentation patch, so I think it would be best to make the tests more functional - checking that returned matrices have the desired properties - and less about the actual entries of the matrices.  I'll put that on my list.

This looks good, and I think it is reasonable to use the Q as it is.

Could you please go over the patch and correct the ``Q`` and Q to `Q` (and I think in some places R is missing the quotes also). Then I can give this a positive review.

Dear Martin,

Thanks for participating remotely in Sage Days 40.5.  ;-)

"formatting" patch is an add-on, so you can see the changes.  I did the "OUTPUT" section entirely with math quotes, other than the result objects.  The rest is in code quotes.

Updated the output description, which needed work.  Added some left kernel explanation for Dan Drake, who was also looking at this here at SD 40.5.

Thanks again,
Rob
