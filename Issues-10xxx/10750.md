In [this](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/365/solve-confusion) ask.sagemath question, there is some inconsistency in our use of Maxima's solve, or possibly its solving.

```
s=list(var('s_%d' % i) for i in range(3));
var('x y z');
print solve([],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z,y==y],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([z==z,y==y,x==x],s_0,s_1,s_2)
print solve([s_0==0],s_0,s_1,s_2);
print solve([s_0==0,s_1==s_1],s_0,s_1,s_2)
```

```
[[s_0 == c1, s_1 == c2, s_2 == c3]]
({s_0: r1}, [])
[[s_0 == r6, s_1 == r5, s_2 == r4]]
[[s_0 == r9, s_1 == r8, s_2 == r7]]
([s_0 == 0], [1])
[[s_0 == 0, s_1 == r11, s_2 == r10]]
```

Most of these do make sense, but you'll notice the change from complex to real variables, one place that seems to have a multiplicity, and the one with only a dictionary as output!

See also [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/daf0a5da1da38410) for another example of where this cropped up.  We need to change the behavior of solve and the documentation to fix this.

AFAIK, the issue with only a dictionary output was fixed in #8553. Multiplicity seems to be (one of) the problem(s) in #5679. Perhaps we should make this ticket only about the real & complex variables.

There are so many tickets about `solve()`. It would be good to make a trac wiki page to list all of them. This should help avoid duplicates.

Okay, it turns out that there are a few problems here.
* When one solves a single `Expression`, all args are passed to `Expression.solve()` which means `s_1` goes to `multiplicities`, and so we are getting multiplicities with the trailing `[]` and `[1]`.  
* If one does this with three variables, then `solution_dict` is also `True` and we get the dict.
* Then there is the complex/real issue, which I haven't delved into.

We should fix this all so that the solutions make sense and are consistent.

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
The documentation for "solve" in symbolic/relation.py says that the arguments are

```
    -  ``f`` - equation or system of equations (given by a
       list or tuple)
    
    -  ``*args`` - variables to solve for.
    
    -  ``solution_dict``
```
The function is defined as `def solve(f, *args, **kwds):`.  So I think we can assume that `args` is the list of variables, whereas any keywords are in `kwds`.  So 

- we should document some more possible keywords, like `multiplicities`, or at least give pointers to documentation to any other solve routines which get called by this one, and

- if args has length greater than one, then we obviously shouldn't just call `Expression.solve()`, but deal with it some other way.  Can we just change the beginning?

Some of the documentation things you mention are dealt with (to some extent) at #10444, which bitrotted a bit.

Your potential solution seems reasonable - really (as Jason implies in his post about the Python keywords issue) the args shouldn't go on without keywords in this case.   I wouldn't worry as much about the `is_Symbolic...` though I guess it couldn't hurt.

I think you changed the previous test, which is fine.  But we should catch the `solution_dict` issue as well (that is to say we should test that that error no longer occurs).  

To test this, one should especially try to make things which previously would have gone into `Expression.solve` break.  For instance, we would want to make sure multiplicities still could work as well as possible.  I think your code will keep that, but it's what would want to be checked.  I do not think I will have time to do that right now, sadly.

Someone would also want to just check whether this is enough to close #10444 as a dup, which jhpalmieri is suggesting and I suspect is true.

Paul's problem is just that Maxima recognized that everything is a solution and returned `all`.

```
(%i1) solve(q=q,(w,y,z));
(%o1)                                 all
(%i2) solve(w=w,(w,y,z));
(%o2)                                 all
(%i3) solve(w=w,y);
(%o3)                                 all
(%i4) solve(w=w,w);
(%o4)                                 all
```
We would need to special-case this somehow.  Good eye!
