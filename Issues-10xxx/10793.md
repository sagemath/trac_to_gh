Let's make a matrix and use it to define a morphism:

```
sage: projection = matrix(ZZ,[[1,0,0],[0,1,0]])
sage: projection
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
sage: H = Hom(ZZ^3, ZZ^2)
sage: H(projection)
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[1 0]
[0 0]
[1 0]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
```
As we see, the matrix of the morphism is very unlikely to be what it should be. Here is the source of the problem:

```
sage: projection.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3 , 2)
sage: M
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M(projection)
[1 0]
[0 0]
[1 0]
```
So the matrix space converts the input to the matrix no matter what (same with `matrix` command, but inside morphisms matrix spaces are used). I suppose this will work any time the number of entries in the original and in the destination is matching. I think that if one really wants to do it, then this one is very welcome to insert an explicit conversion of a matrix to a list and then back to a matrix, but the above should raise exceptions.

I have completely replaced the original Volker's description since the problem is unrelated to fan morphisms themselves.

Also I think that this is an extremely dangerous bug and will take the liberty to elevate its priority...

So it seems that the problem here is that in converting to an element of the matrix space, it views the entries of the matrix (or indeed, the entries of a nested list as well) as a flattened list:

```
sage: M
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
[1 2]
[3 4]
[5 6]
```

So I guess you're saying that MatrixSpace shouldn't flatten the list, but instead should throw an error?

                        if x != zero:
                            if rows:
                                e[(i,j)] = x
                            else:
                                e[(j,i)] = x
                entries = e
            else:
                entries = sum([v.list() for v in entries],[])
```

So:

1. I think it tries to be too intelligent about guessing whether you have rows or columns.  That leads to inconsistent behavior when you have code dealing with different matrix spaces with different dimensions.

2. It indeed does flatten the list if all else fails (that's the sum([v.list()... line).  I agree that that looks dangerous as well.

Absolutely! I see no reason why such flattening can make sense, so even if there some - I think they should do it explicitly.

I find it a bit confusing that Sage uses right matrix action, so in the description I tend to think that `projection` itself is the matrix of the morphism, not its transpose. I suspect I am not the only one who can fall into this trap: it is accepted as an input, but some other not-very-related matrix is then used in the morphism.
