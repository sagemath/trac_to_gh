`random_matrix()` will build a variety of random matrices, employing the `random_element()` method for the base ring.  This patch provides the basic functionality for creating random vectors, or random free module elements, mimicking the constructor for matrices.

This depends trivially on #10364 since both write into the same line of `all.py`.

`.random_element()` allows setting the density of the result (fraction of zeros), while this routine allows for sparse representations.  The present routine could be extended to include a probability argument to allow for controlling the density.  Run times look similar.

```
sage: time for i in range(5000): random_vector(QQ, 100)
CPU times: user 4.22 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 4.27 s
Wall time: 4.28 s
sage: V=QQ^100
sage: time for i in range(5000): V.random_element()
CPU times: user 3.95 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.95 s
Wall time: 3.96 s
```

So I think this is ready (again) for review.

Hi Rob,

This looks good!  Two comments, the second of which is petty:

* I think the default ring should be `RR` rather than `ZZ`.  I can think of lots of uses for a vector of random reals, but not as many for a vector of integers.  I'm open to persuasion though!

* Before doing `degree = ring` it would be good to check that `degree==None`.  Otherwise the following slips through without raising an error:

```
sage: random_vector(11,2)
(0, 1, -3, 2, -9, -1, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
```

Attachment: **[trac_10477-random-vector-constructor-v2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10477/trac_10477-random-vector-constructor-v2.patch.gz)**

Hi Felix,

Thanks for the catch on the `degree` argument.  If no ring is specified, and a value is in the second slot (so assigned to the degree keyword) I have shoved it into the front-end of the argument list.  A new doctest shows this in action.  (Inserting a new random doctest then meant changing *all* of the subsequent random output.)

So with this change in the new patch we have:

Before:

```
sage: random_vector(10, 50)
(1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, -2, -1, -63, 1)
```

After:

```
sage: random_vector(10, 50)
(48, 24, 48, 33, 6, 9, 41, 14, 43, 44)
```

I think every one of the matrix constructors (random or otherwise) defaults to the integers.  I'd guess two reasons for this - Sage's roots in number theory, or matrices (vectors) over other rings will usually play nicely with integers (in other words, the integers will coerce smoothly into lots of rings).

In any event, I used the integers only for some measure of consistency with the matrix constructors.

Rob
