Ok, here are some of the graphs in which I've been testing the algorithms, and the corresponding timings:

#Random GNP with 30 vertices and p = 0.3 (density 0.31)

sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .3)
sage: g.density()
136/435
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = True)
25 loops, best of 3: 35 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False)
5 loops, best of 3: 184 ms per loop


#Random GNP with 30 vertices and p = 0.5 (density 0.51)

sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .5)
sage: g.density()
224/435
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 101 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False)
5 loops, best of 3: 396 ms per loop


#Random GNP with 30 vertices and p = 0.7 (density 0.68)

sage: g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .7)
sage: g.density()
20/29
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 574 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False)
5 loops, best of 3: 621 ms per loop


#Complete multipartite graph with 4 parts of size 10 each(density = 0.77)

sage: g = graphs.CompleteMultipartiteGraph([10, 10, 10, 10])
sage: g.density()
10/13 # = 0.77
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 6.03 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.96 s per loop


#Complete graph on 30 vertices (density = 1)

sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(30)
sage: g.density()
1
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 4.76 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.traveling_salesman_problem(constraint_generation = False)
5 loops, best of 3: 870 ms per loop


Its clear that as the graph becomes very dense, constraint_generation tends to be much slower.
What we could do is to check the density of the graph before in order to decide which algorithm use, when no algorithm was specified in the function call.
In my opinion the best would be to use constraint generation when density is smaller than 0.7 and use the other algorithm otherwise.

In this 9months old patch ? `O_o`

No idea `O_o`

Though if I remember correctly the french lines have been removed recently in an unrelated patch by David Coudert `:-D`

it meant "with constraint generation" and "without constraint generation". I should have changed it before sending the patch but probably forgot `:-)`
