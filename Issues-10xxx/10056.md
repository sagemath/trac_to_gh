The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) moved to http://oeis.org/.

Replacing any occurrence of `http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/` by `http://oeis.org/classic/` should do the job.

The following files should be modified accordingly:

```
sage/coding/sd_codes.py
sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py
sage/databases/sloane.py
sage/graphs/digraph_generators.py
sage/graphs/graph_generators.py
sage/rings/rational_field.py
sage/symbolic/constants.py
```

Hi Alexandre,

i agree with your remark, though this was not a hard job to make a grep and 14 replacements by hand (and we can hope that the url won't change every year). I just wanted to be sure that when Sloane will remove the encyclopedia from his personal webpage, sage will not be affected.

Note that only 5 replacements come inside the code as variables, whereas 9 replacements arise in the documentation or comments. Is there a way to put variables in the documentation too?

Another remark that may help for the future: note that there was a trick: the urls beginning with `http://www.research.att.com/~njas/hadamard` should not be replaced by the new OEIS url (there are about 3 of them in sage), since they come from another work of Sloane, which is not the encyclopedia of integer sequences. In particular, if there was a global variable named `sloane_web_page` then it would have made more work to separate both kind of links.

Hi,

I know this ticket is closed, but I showed it to the current maintainer of OEIS, and he had several issues with it, which could be addressed in followup ticket(s):

"That ticket describes an update but not one that would have been needed to fix broken links. We've kept all the old www.research.att.com links running throughout the transition, including now.
