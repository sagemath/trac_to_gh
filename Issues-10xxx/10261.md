As noticed by Florent Hivert [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/b24d16504611c73f), the following two objects :

```
sage: w = Word('010120')
sage: z = Word([0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0])
```

have the same string representation :

```
sage: w
word: 010120
sage: z
word: 010120
```

but are not equal :

```
sage: w == z
False
```

Indeed, w and z are defined on different alphabet :

```
sage: w[2]
'0'
sage: z[2]
0
```

Documentation about this should be improved.

Also that url looks very bad:
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/words/__init__.html

which is referenced from 
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/index.html
