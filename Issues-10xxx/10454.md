Some approaches to teaching linear algebra define nonsingular matrices before broaching matrix invertibility.  This will just add is_singular, with some changes to the associated documentation.  thus making it a bit easier for Sage usage to follow one possible development of the topic.

I had that thought.  It would then no longer be an alias, which means (a) the documentation could be separate from invertibility, and (b) it would only need to be done once (`is_invertible` is defined twice).  Does it work for users/students?  I like to **define** nonsingular, but there is no real good reason for that, I guess.  What's your preference?

It is never what it seems.  Over a commutative ring, the **right** thing to do is to define `is_singular()` to be the condition that the matrix has a zero determinant.

So this needs to be a new method, it is better stated as the positive version, and it is more than just a convenience.
