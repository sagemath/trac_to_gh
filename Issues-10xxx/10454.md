Some approaches to teaching linear algebra define nonsingular matrices before broaching matrix invertibility.  This will just add is_singular, with some changes to the associated documentation.  thus making it a bit easier for Sage usage to follow one possible development of the topic.

Do you think it might be better to add the positive phrasing, m.is_singular(), rather than the negative nonsingular version?

It would then no longer be an alias, which means (a) the documentation could be separate from invertibility, and (b) it would only need to be done once (`is_invertible` is defined twice).

I had that thought.

It is never what it seems.  Over a commutative ring, the **right** thing to do is to define `is_singular()` to be the condition that the matrix has a zero determinant.

So this needs to be a new method, it is better stated as the positive version, and it is more than just a convenience.
