Some approaches to teaching linear algebra define nonsingular matrices before broaching matrix invertibility.  This will just add is_singular, with some changes to the associated documentation.  thus making it a bit easier for Sage usage to follow one possible development of the topic.

I had that thought.

Does it work for users/students?  I like to **define** nonsingular, but there is no real good reason for that, I guess.  What's your preference?

<a id='comment:6'></a>It is never what it seems.  Over a commutative ring, the **right** thing to do is to define `is_singular()` to be the condition that the matrix has a zero determinant.

So this needs to be a new method, it is better stated as the positive version, and it is more than just a convenience.
