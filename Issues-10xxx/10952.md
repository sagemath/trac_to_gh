If a line contains `tol` or `tolerance`, numerical results are only 
verified to the given tolerance. This may be prefixed by `abs[olute]` or `rel[ative]` to specify whether to measure absolute or relative error; defaults to relative error except when the expected value is exactly zero: 

```
        sage: RDF(pi)                               # abs tol 1e-5 
        3.14159 
        sage: [10^n for n in [0.0 .. 4]]            # rel tol 2e-4 
        [0.9999, 10.001, 100.01, 999.9, 10001] 
```

This can be useful when the exact output is subject to rounding error and/or processor floating point arithmetic variation.

I applied 10952-tol-bin.patch in the local/bin directory of a skynet/taurus (x86_64-Linux-nehalem) build of sage-4.7.rc2. I next did 'sage -b'.  I then modified a doctest to include the lines in
the ticket description

```
sage: print "The answers are", 1.5, 2, 1e-12 # tol 1e-3
The answers are 1.499999 2.0001 0
```
I then did 'sage -b' again.  When I run the doctest, I get

Attachment [trac_10952-reviewer-docs.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket10952/trac_10952-reviewer-docs.patch) by @rbeezer created at 2011-08-22 06:24:44

I have added an "Apply" list for this ticket.

My patch fixes one typo in the documentation (a missing ]).

I have added some non-trivial tests.

Jeroen:

1.  abs() for a matrix computes the determinant.  Not useful for testing.

2.  Is there a class of polynomials with numerical coefficients?  Does it have abs() defined on it?

I am working on this as a high-priority ticket for Bug Days 32.

Rob

This ticket is pretty amazing.

Rob, this doctest you added seems very wrong:

```

   A relative tolerance on a root of a polynomial.
    
   ::
   
       sage: p = (y - 10^16)*(y-10^(-13))*(y-2); p
       y^3 + (-1e+16)*y^2 + (2e+16)*y - 2000.0
       sage: p.roots()
       sage: p.roots(multiplicities=False)[2]     # relative tol 1e-10
       10^16
```

In particular, 

* it seems that y isn't defined
* the output of `p.roots()` is missing
* I get an output of `1e16` instead of `10^16`.

Reviewer documentation v2 patch cleans up the mess.

I used `10^16` intentionally.  The tolerance feature does *arithmetic* with the 
output, so does not have to identically match as text.  Maybe that deserves a comment?

Shouldn't the code only be included if the doctests actually contain `# tol ...`?

`( +[0-9.e+-]+)?` hardly matches what we want btw.

This doesn't work. Re Leif's comment, I think the regexp should something like `' ((\.[0-9]+|[0-9]+(\.[0-9]*)?)e[+-]?[0-9]+)'`, which adds another group to the match, so we need to make this change:

Save this as "new.py" and run "sage -t new.py" to see some bad behavior.

```
' ((\.[0-9]+|[0-9]+(\.[0-9]*)?)e[+-]?[0-9]+)'`
```

But that doesn't match `1ee7` :(

You can of course match funny things first, i.e. use more general patterns, but you then have to check the matched expression further before passing it to `float()`.

The whole idea isn't that bad, but carries the danger that people simply increase the tolerance (too much) just to make doctests pass *somehow*, without caring where the variations originate from.

Added complexity? One boolean variable, initialized to false and set to `True` in only a few places?

This not only reduces the file size and run (import!) time but also avoids more potential name clashes.

Why should one add useless code to each and every file to doctest not using `# tol`?

I don't see anything wrong with more complicated regular expressions, but I like regular expressions.  So leave it as is if you want.

Since the whole ticket had a positive review earlier, I think if you're happy with my changes, you can switch it back to that status.

Finally, the issue with doctests in `conventions.rst` is, I think, that the various triple quotes `"""` confuse the parsing routine (the function `pythonify_rst` in particular).  This belongs on another ticket.  That file contains enough incomplete code stubs that I wonder if it shouldn't be doctested at all...

Haven't tested your patch (nor looked at it), but the output you gave looks much better.

I won't object, though I in general don't like the idea of adding code (regardless how small the overhead or impact might be) unconditionally, i.e., if there's no need to do so.

We have similar situations all around, where everybody adds "just a little", IMHO.

Currently, it raises an error indicating that the *doctest* itself is bad.

Yes, it's a tradeoff between adding "just a little" python parsing overhead to the testing infrastructure or "just a little" human parsing overhead to the testing infrastructure. I'd rather put the burden on machines than developers in this case. 

The reviewer patches look good, certainly an improvement, so I'm setting this back to positive review unless there's something else that needs to be taken care of.

I'd like to draw the attention of folks here to[comment:7](#comment%3A7):ticket:12493.  Apparently one can't do `only-optional` tests along with `tol` tests at the same time.   My guess is that not too many people use `only-optional` and the `tol` stuff is pretty new.

In fact, I only found one occurrence in 5.0.beta3.  Can that be right?  This has been in Sage for months!

```
sage: search_src(" tol ","#")
symbolic/integration/integral.py:587:        sage: error.numerical_approx() # abs tol 10e-10
```
Anyway, even if my analysis is wrong (let's hope it's easier than that), I figure the people here can give a quick diagnosis of #12493.
