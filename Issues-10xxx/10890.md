`sage.combinat.partition.PartitionsInBox(h, w)` is the combinatorial class of partitions that fit in a h by w box. Therefore, `PartitionsInBox(h,w).list()` is supposed to return a list of `Partition`s. However, if h=0, it returns `[[]]` (a list containing a list) instead of `[Partition([])]` (a list containing a `Partition`).


Example (with Sage 4.6.2 and sage-combinat):

```
sage: type(PartitionsInBox(0,0)[0])
<type 'list'>
```

while we should have:

```
sage: type(PartitionsInBox(0,0)[0])
<class 'sage.combinat.partition.Partition_class'>
```

I am going to add a patch in the Mercurial queue to fix this.
