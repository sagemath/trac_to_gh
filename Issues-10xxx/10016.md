This already caused trouble when the Sage scripts spkg wasn't yet installed, and making all standard packages depend on the complete set of Sage scripts (which had actually then been done) is an overkill.

There's a lot wrong with this spkg, and the Rpy spkg should be moved out of R's (#9906), but as a short-term solution, I decided to just replace the call to `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` (which requires `sage-sage`) by a direct one to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-spkg`, which should be present in any case, s.t. we don't have to make the R spkg depend on the Sage scripts spkg.

The new p4 spkg does not address any other issues.

### r-2.10.1.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, September 25th 2010)
* #10016: Don't call "sage -f" on the included Rpy spkg, instead call
  "sage-spkg -f" directly, since only this is guaranteed to be present.
  This is just a temporary solution, until the Rpy spkg is removed
  from this one.

> So because of the tee command, is the install log for rpy going to appear in both r-2.10.1.p4.log and rpy2-2.0.8.log?

I will appear in both. Note that previously the `./sage -f ...` directly wrote (appended) to `$SAGE_ROOT/install.log` as well, which I consider also a bug.

> I suppose I should try it and see.  Should I use the "deps" file from #9896?

This makes no difference, since R still depends on the scripts in both.
(But you could remove the dependency of R on `sage_scripts` in the `deps.v2b` at #9896.)
