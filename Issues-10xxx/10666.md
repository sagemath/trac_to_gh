At #10226, Volker Braun rewrote the installation scripts for ATLAS in pure Python, and introduced a new environment variable: SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH. This should be documented in the installation guide: http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables 

Also, the SAGE_ATLAS_LIB now only has to point to the directory contaning the libraries. 

Apply [attachment:trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH.patch], [attachment:trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch].

See also #10226 (Rewrite ATLAS spkg-install).
