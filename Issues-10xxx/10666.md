At #10226, Volker Braun rewrote the installation scripts for ATLAS in pure Python, and introduced a new environment variable: SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH. This should be documented in the installation guide: http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables 

Also, the SAGE_ATLAS_LIB now only has to point to the directory contaning the libraries. 

Apply [[attachment:trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/98b954f5d46e81a3e79dbc038cb7f720.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/fdb3f2d50bd56bdbb364d312b2bbfe50.patch),).
