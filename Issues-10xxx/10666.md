At #10226, Volker Braun rewrote the installation scripts for ATLAS in pure Python, and introduced a new environment variable: SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH. This should be documented in the installation guide: http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables 

Also, the SAGE_ATLAS_LIB now only has to point to the directory contaning the libraries. 

Apply [[attachment: trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch.gz)(https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/f8a4a17acb3dc2d6205f337240a331a4.gz).

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A11):
> The SAGE_ATLAS_LIB patch still needs review, should be uncontroversial. In particular, backward compatibility is maintained.
