At #10226, Volker Braun rewrote the installation scripts for ATLAS in pure Python, and introduced a new environment variable: SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH. This should be documented in the installation guide: http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables 

Also, the SAGE_ATLAS_LIB now only has to point to the directory contaning the libraries. 

Apply [attachment: trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH.patch.gz), [attachment: trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10666/trac_10666_document_SAGE_ATLAS_LIB.patch.gz).
