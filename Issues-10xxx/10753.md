<a id='comment:5'></a>
The sage-support discussion in the ticket description

- mentions a problem observed in Sage 4.6.1 which had matplotlib 1.0.0
- says the problem is fixed in further versions of matplotlib

We are now using matplotlib 3.3.

All we need is a doctest for the problem in this ticket.
