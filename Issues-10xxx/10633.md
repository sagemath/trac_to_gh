From comments on #2100 about aspect ratio:

```
Would it be possible to extend the functionality so that it is possible to specify either only 
width or only height of the final figure? I am thinking of using it in conjunction with 
SageTeX, where it would be natural to ask either for width=\textwidth or 
height=0.5\texthight and have the second dimension determined automatically based on 
the actual plot and aspect ratio.
```
This seems reasonable, but was bigger than the goals of #2100.

 This seems reasonable, but was bigger than the goals of #2100.
