This doesn't work:

```
pts= [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1.5, 1],[2,1],[5,2],[6,3],[7,3]]
points(pts)
```

but this does

```
pts= [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1.5, 1],[2,1],[5,2],[6,3],[7,3]]
point(pts)
```

It seems to work now.  I probably redefined "points" somewhere when I originally ran into it.

Yeah, Mike, I thought it was weird because I thought one was an alias of the other.
