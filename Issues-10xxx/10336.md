Plotting cones relies on the cone's face lattice:

```
sage: halfspace = Cone([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,0,1)])
sage: halfspace.plot()

Is there any reason for why we can't compute the face lattice of a non-strictly convex cone? If there is, we might want to still plot something reasonable in that case...

Originally there was no code to compute face lattices of non-strictly convex cones, but with your recent modifications it will be easy to fix.

Plotting code that I wrote will not immediately work for such cases anyway, but again it should not be terribly difficult to fix, I just was more concerned with plotting fans.

Will work on it!

P.S. Since it was due to `NotImplemented`, I consider this ticket an enhancement ;-)

I am thinking of:
* allowing `cone.faces(d)` to accept any d and return an empty tuple if there are no faces of dimension d;
* returning a tuple of non-empty tuples as the output of `cone.faces()`, i.e. for a half-space it will be just `((plane,), (half-space,))` instead of `((), (), (plane,), (half-space,))` where the d-th tuple contains faces of dimension d.

Thoughts?

Now plotting should work in all modes.

Wall labels will be positioned between two generators that generate the plane of the wall. This will result in OK placement for automatically adjusted generators (i.e. when half-planes are generated by 3 rays and planes by 4). If the user has forced (via `check=False` option) other generators, they can potentially cross labels, in which case this user should place labels manually.

I have switched `toric_plotter` to using `RDF` instead of `RR` since the first seems to be a little faster.
