`sage-run` runs `.sage` files from the command line.  The problem is that pressing `CTRL-C` interrupts the `sage-run` process, but the child process (doing the actual computation) might still continue.  This is very annoying because after this, there is absolutely no way to interrupt the still-running `sage`.
