See #329. It's for doing integrity checks of spkg files. The md5sum of the spkg should be a377b1b98b6e92164f4042783a949e75, if you want to be very cautious.

You could review #329 after you're done here. :)

The `sagecommandline` environment is the new thing, so please look carefully at that. Look at the examples, try to make up your own examples, check over the documentation, etc.

Looking over `hg log`, other changes include:

* generated files are now called .sagetex.sage, .sagetex.py, etc.
* the warning that you need to re-run Sage that LaTeX prints is hopefully a little more obvious
* there's a CONTRIBUTORS file.

The commandline environment is the big thing.

The sagecommandline environment is going over margins on the right (perhaps it has textwidth width, but gets shifted?). I think this is a quite serious issue for any LaTeX package, so I will switch it to "needs work." 

(Vertical line on the left and blue on the right on the attached screenshot are parts of window borders, the text above is within margins.)

The documentation says: "The SageTEX package defines a length \sagetexindent, which controls how much the Sage code is indented when typeset." But when I try to change it, it seems that it affects only position of line numbers, not the code indentation itself.

After reading listings documentation, I see that it is easy to turn off line numbers (or shift them off the margins), but it would be great if this was mentioned in the documentation of SageTEX - I think that users of Sage are much more likely to worry about it than about syntax highlighting and other stuff supported by listings.

OK, I'll try to make this the last comment (I wish I could edit the previous ones...)

My complains about \sagetexindent affecting line numbers seem to be wrong, I think it was due to some of the extra code I had. But perhaps it is worth mentioning in the documentation that it does not affect sagecommandline.

That is weird. I have no idea what that is happening. It's because of the tilde in the URL in the footnote. I've asked about this: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5260/why-is-docstrip-putting-extra-macro-calls-in-a-hyperlink-inside-a-footnote-that-h

#2100 may be relevant to the above suggestion.

Also I have another very general suggestion. I didn't succeed in installing sagetex.sty in my home folder and I don't really care what was wrong, as I just copied it directly to the folder with my main .tex file. I think that this is the best option, it should be recommended in the manual, and instead of checking that sagetex.sty version matches the installed Sage version, there should be a check that Sage installation is not older than sagetex.sty.

The reason was mentioned on sage-devel:

Optimization suggestion for listings-styles: `basicstyle` propagates to all other ones, so setting it to `\ttfamily` makes everything typeset with it. Also, there is no bold version of typewriter fonts (at least for standard fonts of LaTeX), so `\bfseries` didn't do anything. The following commands do for me the same typesetting as the original ones, but look a little cleaner and make it easier for the user to understand what should be changed. (I wanted to make everything a little smaller, and my first impression was that I have to insert `\small` into 10 places or so, but one turned out to be enough.)

```
\lstdefinestyle{DefaultSageInputOutput}{
  nolol,
  identifierstyle=,
  name=sagecommandline,
  xleftmargin=5pt,
  numbersep=5pt,
  aboveskip=0pt,
  belowskip=0pt,
  breaklines=true,
  basicstyle={\ttfamily},
  numberstyle=\footnotesize,
  numbers=right
}
\lstdefinestyle{DefaultSageInput}{
  language=Sage,
  style=DefaultSageInputOutput,
  commentstyle={\color{dgreencolor}},
  keywordstyle={\color{dbluecolor}},

  language=SageOutput,
  style=DefaultSageInputOutput,
  commentstyle={\color{dgreencolor}},
  keywordstyle={\color{dbluecolor}},

```
In the last definition I think all styles can go since the output should not be typeset with any kind of "syntax highlighting", in particular True/False should not be blue.

Some more issues:

* If I have a `sagecommandline` block and then I insert `$\sage{...}$` before it, I cannot compile the file. As I understand, because of the reference shift LaTeX tries to substitute the output of sagecommandline into inline sage and that does not work since the latter is in the math mode. But then rerunning Sage does not help since the source code for Sage does not get updated without a successful LaTeX run. So pretty much the only option seems to delete all (or some) autogenerated files, which is a bit annoying.

* If I put `\sage{...}` inside, say, `\begin{gather} ... \end{gather}`, then I get warnings about multiple definition of sage-related labels. Looking at `*.sagetex.py` file I suppose that the issue is in lines

```
try:
 _st_.inline(_sage_const_28 , latex(1+1))
except:
 _st_.goboom(_sage_const_961 )
try:
 _st_.inline(_sage_const_28 , latex(1+1))
except:
 _st_.goboom(_sage_const_961 )
```
i.e. they are exactly the same. I suppose that's just how LaTeX works, it processes the input of complicated math environments twice, but it would be nice if it was somehow taken into account in SageTeX. "Just ignoring these warnings" is not a good option, because I see only the top warnings automatically in my editor and if that space is "occupied" I'll have to scroll manually to see if my new lines have introduced any warnings that I would like to fix.

Attachment: **[STE-new.pdf.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10146/STE-new.pdf.gz)**

OK, I have found fixes for the vertical space issues both before and after. In the sagetex.py file (I am not sure where the original is supposed to be, I was fixing the version in `sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages`).

Lines 77-78 should be

```
    self.souttmp.write('\\newlabel{@sageinline' + str(counter) + '}{{%\n' +
                 s.rstrip() + '}}\n')
```
I have removed four pairs of `{}` before the newline. It may be not the proper place/way to do it, but the main idea is that these braces should not appear on the last line of every command line listing in `*.sagetex.sout`. This seems to fix the issue with extra space appearing after sagecommandline, if the following text starts a new paragraph or a theorem.

Line 145 should be

```
      latex_string = r"\unskip\unskip\vspace{\sagecommandlineskip}" + "\n"
```
Two unskips eliminate the space before sagecommandline which was appearing if the preceding line was "full." One unskip does not work, what is the correct number of them I don't know, but I took the repetition idea from `amsthm.sty` which contains

```
\ifhmode\unskip\unskip\par\fi
```
on line 140.

It is possible that `\ignorespaces` should be used somehow in the end of blocks for even more robust behaviour.

Please include these fixes, for these spacing issues are really annoying and it is somewhat non-trivial to figure out a workaround ;-)

Doing that breaks hyperref compatibility. We can't remove those brace pairs.

No, but if the user has hyperref loaded, any `\newlabel` must have the five `{}` pairs or the document can't be typeset.

That's a good idea, but in that case the copy of `inline` would have the same problem: with hyperref loaded, the `\newlabel` will fail without the extra `{}`s.

I have also changed line 146 to be 

```
      bottom_skip =  r"\vspace{\sagecommandlineskip}" + "\n"
```
since otherwise there is no bottom skip for blocks that do not produce any output.

It may be better to use `\addvspace` instead of `\vspace` - it works fine in the end of blocks since LaTeX is in vertical mode by then, but in the beginning it is in horizontal one, `\par` is not acceptable inside `\newlabel`, and I don't know how to switch to vertical mode otherwise.

Would it be possible to use different label names for different SageTeX environments? If they are not mixed, then there should be no issue with using the output in a wrong mode and the user will be able to generate new input file and run Sage on it without deleting  anything.

Let's please not include the package which was made when this ticket was created, but rather a fresh version reflecting SageTeX repository. The very last issue (resolved by using different link names for different environments) was making it very annoying to modify files with extensive SageTeX usage.

I also made a bunch of suggestions in comment 18 regarding settings of listings. The most important one of them: I strongly feel that there should be no syntax highlighting of any kind in the output (currently True/False are different).

It would be also a good idea to include some short instructions on installing luximono, which allows using bold font for listings and is quite a bit narrower than the standard typerwriter font.

Regarding bold, I also quite strongly feel that listings should not be bold by default (the output may), since "the main thing" should be typeset using "the main style" and when commandline environment is used, the emphasis is probably on the code itself, so it is likely to be the bigger part of the listing. When the output gets large, it is probably a better idea to typeset/represent it some other way.

I'd really like to get the current version into 4.7.1. I looked over the changes since 2.3, and I see three nontrivial, user-visible things:

* use `foo.sagetex.sout`, etc, instead of `foo.sout`. This means that if you put Sage code into `important_paper.sage`, it won't get clobbered when you typeset `important_paper.tex`.
* handle (some) spaces in filenames.
* use separate labels for `inline` and `commandline` (as reported above).

The issues not addressed are the spacing issues that Andrey has noted. The stuff about syntax highlighting needs to be addressed, but I think that counts as bikeshedding here.

If we merge the current version of SageTeX, we have something that definitely works better than what's currently shipping. I will likely have time over the summer to work on that, and in any case, Andrey (and Volker, and many other SageTeXers) will be at Sage Days 31 and we can have a discussion there.

Here's my proposal: I make a spkg for the current version of SageTeX and we merge that with 4.7.1, and work on the other problems noted here over the summer. What do you think?

I also don't mind if the output is too colorful. If you don't like the syntax highlighting then its easy to turn off, but if its initially turned off then its hard to discover that the feature is there.

As long as we merge the version with separate label names - I am fine!

I will be even happier if there are no colored keywords in the output, which is a simple change ;-) But since it does not affect how things work, we may leave it and other things to the next version, after perhaps having some live discussions.

I'm switching this to "needs review"; if that spkg works, then switch this to positive review and let's get this into 4.7.1 and work on the other bits this summer.
