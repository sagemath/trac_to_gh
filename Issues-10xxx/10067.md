Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A1):

This patch looks pretty weird. It essentially says that
methods is_even_hole_free() and is_forest() cannot be applied to an instance of BipartiteGraph.
Why is that?
Isn't BipartiteGraph inheriting from Graph?

IMHO it looks like you cure a symptom rather than the root of the problem.
