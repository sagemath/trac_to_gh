```
A not full-dimensional cone sometimes thinks it is not smooth even though it is:

```
sage: Cone([(1,0,0), (2,1,1)]).is_smooth()
True
sage: Cone([(1,0,0), (2,1,2)]).is_smooth()
False
```
Note that the two cones are the same up to a SL(3,Z) coordinate change.

The attached patch fixes this.

Thank you, nice catch! I really should be more careful with non-full dimensional code...
