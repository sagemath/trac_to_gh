<div id="comment:0"></div>

When multiplying two matrices M and N, typically one first creates a zero matrix of an appropriate matrix space. That means:

* Call `M.matrix_space(...)`.
* This calls `M.parent().matrix_space(...)`.
* This calls `MatrixSpace(...)`.
* This tests, whether the base ring really is a ring and whether the matrix space is already in the cache.

This can obviously be improved:

* `M.matrix_space(...)` should avoid the overhead of calling `M.parent()` but create the matrix space directly.
* It is already known that the base ring is a ring. So, there is no need to test it.
* One may access the cache directly, thus, avoid the overhead of calling `MatrixSpace`.

I guess the ticket belongs to linear algebra. Correct me if I'm wrong.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I did not run the doc test yet, but I think it already ready for review.

Here are timings. Note that the reduced overhead is most visible when the multiplication itself is trivial.

Without the patch:

```
sage: def test(M):
....:     for i in xrange(10^6):
....:         M*=M
....:     return M
....:
sage: m = matrix(GF(3),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 51.36 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 51.52 s
Wall time: 51.67 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(GF(2),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 39.16 s, sys: 0.20 s, total: 39.36 s
Wall time: 39.47 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(ZZ,[[1]])
# apparently there is no overhead for matrices over ZZ
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 7.81 s, sys: 0.15 s, total: 7.96 s
Wall time: 7.99 s
[1]
```

With the patch

```
sage: def test(M):
....:     for i in xrange(10^6):
....:         M*=M
....:     return M
....:
sage: m = matrix(GF(3),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 33.65 s, sys: 0.30 s, total: 33.95 s
Wall time: 34.05 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(GF(2),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 25.41 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 25.51 s
Wall time: 25.58 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(ZZ,[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 7.62 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 7.78 s
Wall time: 7.80 s
[1]
```

Thus, over `GF(3)` and `GF(2)` the overhead is clearly reduced.

I don't know how the patch could be doc-tested, as it only concerns the performance.

Thank you! As I wrote when I posted my patch, I hadn't run the tests, and then I was working on different tickets. Now I'll try to hunt it down.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

The test failures were caused by a very stupid mistake: `self.new_matrix()` by default assumes that the dimension of the new matrix is the same as the dimension of the old matrix. In the multiplication algorithms, I saw `self.new_matrix(nrows=self.nrows(),...)`, was not reading further, and thought that we are in the default case, thus, deleted the arguments.

Of course, it continues "(..., ncols=right.ncols())`.

What I did now was to avoid calling `self.nrows()` and `right.ncols()` - direct access to the attributes `self._nrows` and `right._ncols` is faster.

To my surprise, the timings improved a little more:

```
sage: def test(M):
....:     for i in xrange(10^6):
....:         M*=M
....:     return M
....: 
sage: m = matrix(GF(3),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 36.67 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 36.83 s
Wall time: 36.95 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(GF(2),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 26.29 s, sys: 0.14 s, total: 26.43 s
Wall time: 26.50 s
[1]
```

Is it faster to provide arguments with a default value *explicitly*?

The tests for `sage/matrix/` passed. I am now running all doctests (not the long ones), but I think I can already revert it to "needs review".

I was updating the patch again. I am now also taking more care of sparse matrices, and I found yet another spot where overhead by calling methods could be reduced.

**__Updated timings in sage.4.6.2.alpha4__**

```
sage: def test(M):
....:     for i in xrange(10^6):
....:         M*=M
....:     return M
....: 
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5),5,5,sparse=True)
sage: ms = MS([3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3])
sage: MD = MatrixSpace(GF(5),5,5,sparse=False)
sage: md = MD([3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3])
```

Without patch:

```
sage: %time test(ms)
CPU times: user 42.41 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 42.43 s
Wall time: 42.57 s
[1 2 4 4 3]
[3 1 2 1 3]
[1 2 2 3 1]
[2 4 0 4 4]
[2 4 2 1 3]
sage: %time test(md)
CPU times: user 53.54 s, sys: 0.20 s, total: 53.74 s
Wall time: 53.90 s
[1 2 4 4 3]
[3 1 2 1 3]
[1 2 2 3 1]
[2 4 0 4 4]
[2 4 2 1 3]
```

With patch:

```
sage: %time test(ms)
CPU times: user 29.72 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 29.75 s
Wall time: 29.84 s
[1 2 4 4 3]
[3 1 2 1 3]
[1 2 2 3 1]
[2 4 0 4 4]
[2 4 2 1 3]
sage: %time test(md)
CPU times: user 34.13 s, sys: 0.36 s, total: 34.49 s
Wall time: 34.59 s
[1 2 4 4 3]
[3 1 2 1 3]
[1 2 2 3 1]
[2 4 0 4 4]
[2 4 2 1 3]
```

Or, with the (dense) examples that I used in the previous posts:

```
sage: m = matrix(GF(2),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 22.87 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 22.99 s
Wall time: 23.06 s
[1]
sage: m = matrix(GF(3),[[1]])
sage: %time test(m)
CPU times: user 33.31 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 33.43 s
Wall time: 33.52 s
[1]
```

So, the progress is clear.

I am now running doc tests (there was no problem for the previous patch), but I think it is safe to keep it "needs review".

Simon,

Looks real good.  One suggestion - and it really is *just* a suggestion.  Your call.

Two instances of basically:

```
try:
    from sage.matrix.matrix_space import _cache
    MS = _cache[base_ring, nrows, ncols, sparse]()
except KeyError:
    return MatrixSpace(base_ring, nrows, ncols, sparse)
if MS is not None:
    return MS
return MatrixSpace(base_ring, nrows, ncols, sparse)
```

and a suggested replacement:

```
try:
    from sage.matrix.matrix_space import _cache
    MS = _cache[base_ring, nrows, ncols, sparse]()
except KeyError:
    MS = None
if MS is None:
    return MatrixSpace(base_ring, nrows, ncols, sparse)
else:
    return MS
```

Suggestion uses try/except to form "best guess" for `MS`.  Either we find it, or we get `None`.  Then if/else returns it, or creates it and returns it.

An extra line, an extra comparison in one case, but the `not` is gone and most importantly, just one place to describe the actual `MatrixSpace` call (instead of two that are identical).  Anyway, a toss-up, I'd guess, so just a suggestion.

In the meantime, I am going to run the full test suite right now.

Rob
