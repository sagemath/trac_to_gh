After some confusion trying to get a docstring to pass doctesting, I think input line continuations are "not working", in that lines directly pasted from the sage interpreter prompt do not pass doctests when single inputs span multiple lines. Pasted below is some terminal output (analysis continued afterwards):

After I replace all "....: " with "... " using `sed`, everything seems to work fine.

It seems to me that the problem is that sage is not converting "....: " to "... ", which is what the standard python interactive prompt uses as a prefix for continued input lines. However, the sage prompt uses "....: ", so IMHO the doctesting framework should allow for this, so that lines from sage sessions can really be just dumped into a docstring without any further editing.

I would consistently add the trailing blank in the prompt substitutions.

At first glance it seems we currently lose the original (non-preparsed) source code of continuation lines (but also that this isn't a regression).

I'm not sure what you mean by "consistently add the trailing blank". The substitutions I patched in do not remove or add any further spaces, so no loss of trailing blanks will occur. If there was a blank after a "...", "....:", or "sage:", there will correspondingly be one after the "...", "...", or ">>>" respectively.

Yeah, I'm not too sure why the source code disappears from all but the first line.

OK, I'll fix the patch up then.

By the way, when changing my patch submission should I be uploading further patch files to layer on top of the one I've got here, or replacing this patch with new patches which diff to 4.6?

Well, that's just another bug (we should fix here, too).

Depends on the changes. Unfortunately, ordinary trac users cannot *delete* (or rename) attachments, not even their own.

So you could upload a new patch with `trac_XXXXX-` in the filename, and let someone else delete the old one.

In general, it's ok to replace your patch with an updated one (sometimes better than having `-v2` etc.); in case you make further changes *rather unrelated* to the previous ones, it's usually better to attach a second patch which is *based on* your previous one. (The attachment comment should then say "*Apply on top of ...*".)

Also, patches should be based on the most recent *developer* version of Sage, i.e. the current alpha or rc. Unless there are merge conflicts (because someone else has changed code near to your changes), it's ok to have it based on some previous official release, too. (But you should always check your patch applies clean to the latest developer release.)

The attachment comment should contain the name of the repository to which to apply the patch (the "default" is the Sage library), in this case "Scripts repo", and usually also mentions on what Sage release it is based, since it is not unusual new releases get out before a ticket gets merged.

(Note that there are more occurrences than I had found in your patch / mentioned above.)

So I would suggest to [re]base your enhancement (accepting "`....: `" line continuations) on these changes, in which case I would attach a proper Mercurial patch for my changes.
 
After that we could address the "lost original source code of continuation lines" issue, with another patch, perhaps on a follow-up ticket if you like.

And someplace the first line of a traceback lacks a colon, and a doctest needs one.  And maybe in the notebook it is different yet again?  Or something like that.

See semi-related, new ticket #11621.  Does it belong in the meta-ticket?  I tripped over it as part of doctesting Sage examples placed into a textbook where I need to be careful about long lines for the printed version.

As it only deals with the preparser and not the doctesting framework, I don't think so.

Open source.  So, no deadline.

Release date: maybe within the week.  Watch sage-edu/sage-devel.

I solved my immediate problem by breaking the input into pieces.  Not as pretty as it could be, but not bad either.
