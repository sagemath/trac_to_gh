```
It seems that the multiplication and the power of a matrix is very slow:

```
size = 500
A = matrix(RR, size, size)
for i in range(size):
    A[i,i] = random()
    for j in range(8):
        A[i,randint(0,size-1)] = random()

timeit('A*A')
```

gives 

```
CPU times: user 60.72 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 60.83 s
Wall time: 61.10 s
500 x 500 dense matrix over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: timeit('A*A')
5 loops, best of 3: 60.6 s per loop

```

Trying with the 100th power of a 2000*2000 matrix is impossible, according to a colleague working for linbox, taking the 100th power of such a matrix would take no more that 10 seconds.

Is the interface with atlas working well ?

I think the issue is that you're doing the computations in RR, the Real Field with 53 bits, rather than in RDF, the Real Double Field.

```
for size in [5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000]:
    A = matrix(RDF, size, size, dense=True)
    for i in range(size):
        A[i,i] = random()
        for j in range(8):
            A[i,randint(0,size-1)] = random()
    print 'size:', size
    print 'time for one multiplication:'
    timeit('A*A')
    print 'time for A**100:'
    timeit('A**100')
```

gives (on my notebook)

```
size: 5
time for one multiplication:
625 loops, best of 3: 79 µs per loop
time for A**100:
625 loops, best of 3: 646 µs per loop
size: 10
time for one multiplication:
625 loops, best of 3: 79.3 µs per loop
time for A**100:
625 loops, best of 3: 648 µs per loop
size: 20
time for one multiplication:
625 loops, best of 3: 83.3 µs per loop
time for A**100:
625 loops, best of 3: 687 µs per loop
size: 50
time for one multiplication:
625 loops, best of 3: 154 µs per loop
time for A**100:
625 loops, best of 3: 1.26 ms per loop
size: 100
time for one multiplication:
625 loops, best of 3: 499 µs per loop
time for A**100:
125 loops, best of 3: 4.11 ms per loop
size: 200
time for one multiplication:
125 loops, best of 3: 3.24 ms per loop
time for A**100:
25 loops, best of 3: 26.2 ms per loop
size: 500
time for one multiplication:
25 loops, best of 3: 35 ms per loop
time for A**100:
5 loops, best of 3: 281 ms per loop
size: 1000
time for one multiplication:
5 loops, best of 3: 237 ms per loop
time for A**100:
5 loops, best of 3: 1.9 s per loop
size: 2000
time for one multiplication:
5 loops, best of 3: 1.64 s per loop
time for A**100:
5 loops, best of 3: 13.4 s per loop
```

which I think is pretty close to your colleague's expectation.

I was the one surprised by Frederic's timings. As `@`kcrisman, i think there is still an issue about misleadingly using `RR` as the default implementation of real floating point (which seems to come from its generic name).

This documentation issue should be fixed by the forthcomig tutorial #15944.
