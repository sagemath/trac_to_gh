```
The method "is_maximal" in sage/rings/ideal.py is broken:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(8)
sage: R.principal_ideal(0).is_maximal()
True
sage: R.principal_ideal(2).is_maximal()
True
sage: R.principal_ideal(4).is_maximal()
True
```
Admittedly, the docstring does say

```
TODO: Make self.is_maximal() work! Write this code!
```
but we need a trac ticket for this.  The comments in the code are not right, either:

```
        kd = self.ring().krull_dimension()
        if kd == 0: # every non-trivial ideal is maximal
```
This appears to be false, as the example above (Z/8Z) illustrates.  It would be true if the ring were an integral domain (because Krull dimension 0 + integral domain = field).  Alternatively, it would be true if the ideal were prime, but we have limited primality testing right now, so this is not the best way to go: with R as above, `R.principal_ideal(2).is_prime()` raises a `NotImplementedError`.  Next:

```
        elif kd == 1 and self.ring().is_integral_domain(): # every nontrivial ideal is maximal
            return self.is_prime()
```
The comment should say "every nontrivial **prime** ideal is maximal, so the code is right but the comment isn't.

All tests pass for me too, and the code behaves as intended on all the examples I could think of. Positive review.

Since this is only a partial implementation of is_maximal() i.e. only for quotient rings of `ZZ`, should we open a separate ticket for implementing this over general rings? Or does such a ticket already exist?
