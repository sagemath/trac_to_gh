Both good points.  sage-location is seriously broken right now anyway.  #9210 goes a long ways towards fixing sage-location, but is mired in some reports of it not working (and some reports of it working).

Shouldn't the setup.py develop create relative references to the sagenb repository, rather than absolute references?  That would take care of the second point.

Okay, it looks like the absolute reference in setup.py develop is in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/easy-install.pth: `/Users/grout/sage-4.6/devel/sagenb-main` -- that should be a relative reference like the rest of the paths in the .pth file are.

The other absolute reference is the $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb.egg-link file: `/Users/grout/sage-4.6/devel/sagenb-main`, which should also be a relative reference.

It looks like we can set this path when we do setup.py develop:

```
sage -python setup.py develop --egg-path ../../../../devel/sagenb-main
```

For the "topmost" link, we could use

```sh
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel"
ln -snf sagenb-main sagenb
```
in SageNB's `spkg-install`.

For example, `sage-build` does

```sh
if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
    # make devel/sage point to devel/$1
    cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/"
    if [ ! -d "sage-$1" ]; then
        # this will happen a lot because of people (=me) making typos.
        echo "No such branch '$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-$1'"
        echo "Use 'sage -clone' to create a new branch."
        exit 1
    fi
    ln -snf "sage-$1" sage
fi
```

See Leif Leonhardy's replies for some suggestions.

I've opened #10176 for this problem.

#10192 (currently needing review) also solves this, but in a different way (by patching `sage-spkg` to get rid of "`.`" in `PYTHONPATH` before installing an spkg).
