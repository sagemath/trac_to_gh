This is a follow-up to #9920.  The package extraction patch at that ticket makes an absolute link

```
ln -sf "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb-main" "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb" 
```
that should be relative.  Also, it seems we need to rerun `python setup.py develop` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-location`.

Both good points.  sage-location is seriously broken right now anyway.  #9210 goes a long ways towards fixing sage-location, but is mired in some reports of it not working (and some reports of it working).

Shouldn't the setup.py develop create relative references to the sagenb repository, rather than absolute references?  That would take care of the second point.

Okay, it looks like the absolute reference in setup.py develop is in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/easy-install.pth: `/Users/grout/sage-4.6/devel/sagenb-main` -- that should be a relative reference like the rest of the paths in the .pth file are.

The other absolute reference is the $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb.egg-link file: `/Users/grout/sage-4.6/devel/sagenb-main`, which should also be a relative reference.

It looks like we can set this path when we do setup.py develop:

```
sage -python setup.py develop --egg-path ../../../../devel/sagenb-main
```

For the "topmost" link, we could use

```sh
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel"
ln -snf sagenb-main sagenb
```
in SageNB's `spkg-install`.

For example, `sage-build` does

```sh
if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
    # make devel/sage point to devel/$1
    cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/"
    if [ ! -d "sage-$1" ]; then
        # this will happen a lot because of people (=me) making typos.
        echo "No such branch '$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-$1'"
        echo "Use 'sage -clone' to create a new branch."
        exit 1
    fi
    ln -snf "sage-$1" sage
fi
```

The effect looks good and spkg looks good.  Positive review.

I've opened #10176 for this problem.

I've uploaded a follow-up spkg patch (currently just for testing / debugging) at #10176, no idea if that fixes the problem. (Others can of course test it on other platforms to make sure it doesn't break anything. Works for me on Ubuntu 10.04.)

Florent reported he had the same failure on OpenSuSE 11.**1**, too, so it might be specific to his installations, since Sage 4.6.rc0 was said to work on Skynet's menas (which runs OpenSuSE 11.1, too), but perhaps just by good luck...

#10192 (currently needing review) also solves this, but in a different way (by patching `sage-spkg` to get rid of "`.`" in `PYTHONPATH` before installing an spkg).
