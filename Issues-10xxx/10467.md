By a private attribute, I mean an attribute whose name starts with two underscores and does not end with an underscore. Such an attribute is used, e.g., in the default `__repr__` method of Sage objects.

It should be reasonable to assume that private attributes belong to a particular instance, not to its class or its category; after all, they are subject to Python's name mangling.

In particular, if `P` is a parent/element, then `P.__foo` is either defined for the instance `P` or will not be available from `P.category().parent_class` resp. from `P.category().element_class`.

It turns out that this assumption holds thorought Sage: When one lets the `__getattr__` methods of Parent/Element immediately raise an `AttributeError` when a private attribute is requested, then all doc tests still pass.

That is what my patch mainly does. In addition, it removes several occurences of an idiom like

```
if hasattr(self,'foo'):
    return self.foo
```
and replaces it with

```
try:
    return self.foo
except AttributeError:
    pass
```
which saves half of the computation time when the attribute actually exists.

The advantage is a considerable speedup. Here are two examples (the last is actually a serious computation):

Without the patch:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('a=repr(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 74.7 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x[1]^2+y[2]*y[3], x[2]*y[1]*x[3]-y[1]*y[2]])
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 23.09 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 23.11 s
Wall time: 23.67 s
[y_2*y_1^3 + y_2*y_1^2, y_2^2*y_1 - y_2*y_1^2, y_3*y_1 - y_2*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1^2 + x_1*y_2*y_1, x_1^2 + y_2*y_1, x_2*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_3 - y_2*y_1, x_3*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_3*x_1*y_2 - y_2*y_1, x_3*x_2*y_1 - y_2*y_1]
```

With the patch:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('a=repr(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 40.5 Âµs per loop
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x[1]^2+y[2]*y[3], x[2]*y[1]*x[3]-y[1]*y[2]])
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 14.43 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 14.46 s
Wall time: 14.53 s
[y_2*y_1^3 + y_2*y_1^2, y_2^2*y_1 - y_2*y_1^2, y_3*y_1 - y_2*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1^2 + x_1*y_2*y_1, x_1^2 + y_2*y_1, x_2*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_3 - y_2*y_1, x_3*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_3*x_1*y_2 - y_2*y_1, x_3*x_2*y_1 - y_2*y_1]
```

The patch also adds doctests in `Parent.__getattr__`, `Element.__getattr__` and several methods of `SageObject`.

Here are two data points.

(1)
I compared "`sage -tp 4 sage/`" before and after applying the patch. It is 1810.3 seconds without the patch, but 1792.5 seconds with the patch. So, on average, it became quicker.

(2)
The timings improve if a non-existing private attribute is requested. So, let us test a situation where an *existing* categorical attribute is requested. For example, the method `summation` method of the rational field is only defined in its category.

Without the patch, I obtained

```
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 553 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 563 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 559 ns per loop
```

With the patch, I obtain

```
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 530 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 514 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 539 ns per loop
```

So, that's a situation where it might expect a slight deceleration with the patch, but in fact it is as quick as before.

I found yet another way to speed things up!

Typically, in Python one requests an attribute and catches an `AttributeError` (this is also done in Python's `hasattr`, IIRC). That happens very often during computations. Hence, it is very important that *raising* the error happens quickly. 

The `__getattr__` methods of sage.structure.parent.Parent and sage.structure.element.Element call a Python method sage.structure.parent.raise_attribute_error, that first creates the error message and then raises the `AttributeError`. Interpreted Python is too slow for that purpose!

Therefore I updated my patch (will post it in a few minutes). Trick: Instead of

```
def raise_attribute_error(self, name)
```
it is now

```
cdef inline raise_attribute_error(self,name)
```

The effect of this little trick, compared with the benchmarks above, is:

(1) Saves almost 20% compared with the old patch, and more than 50% compared with unpatched Sage:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: timeit('a=repr(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 33.8 Âµs per loop
```

(2) Saves almost 10% compared with the old patch and almost 50% compared with unpatched Sage: 

```
sage: R.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = R.ideal([x[1]^2+y[2]*y[3], x[2]*y[1]*x[3]-y[1]*y[2]])
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 13.30 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 13.32 s
Wall time: 13.38 s
[y_2*y_1^3 + y_2*y_1^2, y_2^2*y_1 - y_2*y_1^2, y_3*y_1 - y_2*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1^2 + x_1*y_2*y_1, x_1^2 + y_2*y_1, x_2*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_3 - y_2*y_1, x_3*y_2*y_1 - x_1*y_2*y_1, x_3*x_1*y_2 - y_2*y_1, x_3*x_2*y_1 - y_2*y_1]
```

(3) No significant difference in the third benchmark:

```
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 526 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 524 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a=QQ.summation',number=50000)
50000 loops, best of 3: 527 ns per loop
```

You are right, that needs to be changed.

I applied your referee patch and (to be on the safe side) am running doctests. If it works then (if I understood correctly) I am entitled to change it into positive review, inserting your name as reviewer, right?

Best regards,

Simon

Hi, I am sitting next to Jeroen.

`__getattr__` as implemented in this ticket makes it so that an error
is raised in the following situation:

```
    sage: C = EuclideanDomains()
    sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
    sage: C.element_class.__foo = 'bar'
    sage: x.parent() in C
    True
    sage: x.__foo
```

However, when using plain Python inheritance, no error is raised in
this equivalent situation:

```
    sage: C = Semigroups()
    sage: S = C.example()
    sage: S.category() is C
    True
    sage: C.element_class.__foo = 'bar'
    sage: x = S.an_element()
    sage: x.__foo
    'bar'
```

Given that the role of `__getattr__` is to emulate Python inheritance
as closely as possible, I agree with Jeroen that the above behavior of
raising an error is not desirable. Especially since it has a cost.

Or would there be a use case for this behavior? I don't expect to see
private methods in element_class'es; they probably would not work
anyway.

Cheers,
                             Nicolas
