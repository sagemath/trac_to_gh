Hello Minh !!!!

I didn't expect to find anything wrong with the doc, or with the doctests in your patch... And there wasn't ! `:-D`

I just spotted you were redefining the "is 3-regular" method, which Sage already knows. So here is a one-line patch to add to yours. Afterwards, this ticket is good to go !
