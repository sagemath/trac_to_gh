1) I need the distributive lattice of order ideals of a poset:

```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().order_ideals_lattice() 
```

2) I need the poset of join irreducibles of a lattice:

```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().join_irreducibles_poset()
```

3) The Coxeter tranformation of a poset is a matrix, defined using the order matrix and its inverse, which is useful in the study of the derived category attached to the poset.

```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().coxeter_transformation()
```

My procedure for the distributive lattice now works. N. Thiery has provided a procedure for the poset of join irreducibles. I have written a working procedure for the Coxeter transformation. They are all included in the patch below.


Notes: those changes are now included in #10998; this ticket can be closed as soon as #10998 will go in.

Hello !

Could you rebase your patch on the current release ? It fails to apply on rc1. After that, I think the review should go fast `:-)`

Oops, sorry for not marking that this was a duplicate.
