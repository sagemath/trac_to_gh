Then installed the new `SciPy` spkg at #10887.  Reran the test above and it passed.  Running full tests right now, which I would expect to pass.

So I think that (a) this ticket depends on #10887, and (b) with that dependency this ticket functions just fine and merits a positive review.

Francois - does that look right?
