Un-tar'ed a fresh 4.7.alpha1.  Applied the one patch to SAGE_ROOT.  Built Sage.  Then applied the two Sage library patches and ran long tests.  Got two failures, the second being a consequence of the first, while the first looks genuine.

```

Then installed the new `SciPy` spkg at #10887.  Reran the test above and it passed.  Running full tests right now, which I would expect to pass.

So I think that (a) this ticket depends on #10887, and (b) with that dependency this ticket functions just fine and merits a positive review.

Francois - does that look right?
