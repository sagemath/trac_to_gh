This ticket implements a wrapper for the compiler that lets us rewrite compiler options on the fly. The goal is to fix:

1. Clashes between system and Sage's libraries due to LD_LIBRARY_PATH abuse.
2. Relocation issues, i.e., "dead" (hard-coded) RPATHs in binaries (shared libraries and executables) created by Sage, upon moving the installation (which includes installing a pre-built / binary distribution).
3. Broken compiler versions / tool chains; work around by messing with (e.g.) optimization flags, depending on the present compiler and its known issues.

The wrapper is implemented in pure C++ and does not depend on any Sage component. At the moment it only wraps gcc and does not do anything for other compilers.

How about when gcc and cc and entirely different programs? 

```

drkirkby@hawk:~$ gcc

Jean-Pierre might have something to say as well, since it seems on Cygwin64 clashes of (system's) GCC's DLLs with Sage's (in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` !) get more frequent (so I suggested to him to create wrapper scripts analogous to `sage-native-execute`, but also setting up / using "`SAGE_ORIG_PATH`", not just `*LIBRARY_PATH`).

One use case of the compiler wrapper is to work around (system!) compiler bugs, so unconditionally not installing it if `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no` doesn't make much sense, at least if it's used to prevent installing Sage's GCC (which is the current and intended meaning).

You have to build the wrapper at the very beginning of the build process to be sure to avoid issues on Cygwin.

Thanks.

In fact we also need to patch the Sage repo to define SAGE_ORIG_PATH there IIRC.
Unfortunately I don't have access to the disk where I developped this part right now.
The patch should be up later today.

I've gitified the ticket without making it a standard package (basically, Volker's hg patch).
I think should definitely make it optional at least.

And I give positive review to what Volker done, except for maybe not making the package standard, at least now...

I think its good to have it as an optional/experimental package, let's see if it turns out to be useful.

The SPKG.txt is incorrect in that the upstream repo is git now, but that is trivial.

I don't think its the final answer to our LD_LIBRARY_PATH / relocation woes, I'm working with the hashdist developers on a bullet-proof solution.

Is it? I actually had a look to check if you updated the code but did not even notice it was not bitbucket anymore... or just ended up on the old bitbucket repo, who knows.

> I don't think its the final answer to our LD_LIBRARY_PATH / relocation woes, I'm working with the hashdist developers on a bullet-proof solution.

Sure, but at least it lets Sage build (quite) easily on platforms where PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH will always be a mess like Windows.
