This ticket implements a wrapper for the compiler that lets us rewrite compiler options on the fly. The goal is to fix:

1. Clashes between system and Sage's libraries due to LD_LIBRARY_PATH abuse.
2. Relocation issues, i.e., "dead" (hard-coded) RPATHs in binaries (shared libraries and executables) created by Sage, upon moving the installation (which includes installing a pre-built / binary distribution).
3. Broken compiler versions / tool chains; work around by messing with (e.g.) optimization flags, depending on the present compiler and its known issues.

The wrapper is implemented in pure C++ and does not depend on any Sage component. At the moment it only wraps gcc and does not do anything for other compilers.

What happens if the compiler is not gcc? 

So please don't go making assumptions about compilers and linkers. Bear in mind Solaris system may have gcc configured to use either the GNU or Sun linker.  

This whole idea of the ticket gets a -1 from me. It will make further porting efforts more difficult.

How about when gcc and cc and entirely different programs? 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ cc
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details
drkirkby@hawk:~$ gcc
gcc: no input files

```

Seriously, I would drop the whole idea.

Ok, maybe a new attempt is in order.

I'll try to be more gradual. For now, keep `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` but use the compilerwrapper to rewrite rpaths. I added the feature to overwrite `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with `SAGE_OLD_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before calling gcc/ld, so at least the nasty library version clashes in the compiler are avoided.

We need to figure out what to do if sage builds its own gcc since only one gcc can live in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`. I would be in favor of compiling our own gcc with some pre/postfix as `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc-sage`. The compilerwrapper can then easily switch between this gcc and the host one, if desired. Thoughts?

Jean-Pierre might have something to say as well, since it seems on Cygwin64 clashes of (system's) GCC's DLLs with Sage's (in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` !) get more frequent (so I suggested to him to create wrapper scripts analogous to `sage-native-execute`, but also setting up / using "`SAGE_ORIG_PATH`", not just `*LIBRARY_PATH`).

`SPKG.txt` needs to get updated... ;-)

IMHO also the ticket's description;  there are at least two rather orthogonal problems the compiler wrapper is supposed to fix:

1. Clashes between system and Sage's libraries.

2. Relocation issues, i.e., "dead" (hard-coded) `RPATH`s in binaries (shared libraries and executables) created by Sage, upon moving the installation (which includes installing a pre-built / binary distribution).

3. (Even more unrelated to both of the above:)  Broken compiler versions / tool chains;  work around by messing with (e.g.) optimization flags, depending on the present compiler and its known issues.

One use case of the compiler wrapper is to work around (system!) compiler bugs, so unconditionally not installing it if `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no` doesn't make much sense, at least if it's used to prevent installing Sage's GCC (which is the current and intended meaning).

<a id='comment:55'>Comment 55:</a>
Its true that gcc won't build itself with the wrapper, but then we build gcc right at the beginning before we build any troublesome libraries. And the first stage doesn't need optimizations, to even moderately broken compilers should be fine.

We definitely should think about using a special case from an already existing environment variable to avoid creating too many obscure configuration options that we can never actually test. JP wants a setting so that he can play with potentially broken compilers, and setting `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no` is what you logically would want to set in this use case.

The basic fact is that only one program can be installed as `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc` So you don't have 4 independent choices of sage-gcc yes/no and compilerwrapper yes/no.

What I'm trying to say is: Despite the compiler wrapper being installed first, gcc will build itself internally without wrapper.

Thanks.

In fact we also need to patch the Sage repo to define SAGE_ORIG_PATH there IIRC.
Unfortunately I don't have access to the disk where I developped this part right now.
The patch should be up later today.

I've gitified the ticket without making it a standard package (basically, Volker's hg patch).
I think should definitely make it optional at least.

And I give positive review to what Volker done, except for maybe not making the package standard, at least now...

Volker: Any thoughts on this ticket?

I'll be tempted to positively review it as I've been using it quite often and would definitely need it if I use some of my time for the Cygwin's ports for the h2020 thing.

I think its good to have it as an optional/experimental package, let's see if it turns out to be useful.

The SPKG.txt is incorrect in that the upstream repo is git now, but that is trivial.

I don't think its the final answer to our LD_LIBRARY_PATH / relocation woes, I'm working with the hashdist developers on a bullet-proof solution.

Is it? I actually had a look to check if you updated the code but did not even notice it was not bitbucket anymore... or just ended up on the old bitbucket repo, who knows.

Sure, but at least it lets Sage build (quite) easily on platforms where PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH will always be a mess like Windows.

It is still on bitbucket, but bitbucket supports both hg and git nowadays...
