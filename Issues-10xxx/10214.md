Using an autogenerated file is of course safe, but we could also handle proper touching (as needed) in NumPy's `spkg-install` (cf. #4797); bumping the (Sage) patch level usually does not require a rebuild of modules depending on such an spkg.

You mean touching only if numpy's `spkg-install` detects that we really are upgrading to a new version of numpy as opposed to upgrading from `numpy-1.5.0.spkg` to `numpy-1.5.0.p0.spkg`?  That looks like a lot of hassle for a small gain...

At least that. (In rare cases, a Sage-only update might also require rebuilding the libraries though, which the spkg [maintainer] will be aware of and do the touch, too.)

Many upstream upgrades will not require rebuilding the extension modules at all.

> That looks like a lot of hassle for a small gain...


:-) Depends on your hardware...

It's just that there are so many "brute-force" schemes in Sage that could be much cleaner, not necessarily to speed up the build process but because they break potential improvements, frequently cause trouble and make Sage *less* maintainable.

But I'm ok with your patch. There's always a next release for further improvements... ;-)

(I assume the upgrade path contains your unmodified patch.)

P.S.: In the case of NumPy (#9808), I also used `_numpyconfig.h`, but apparently forgot to post that on the long ticket I could then no longer follow.

An alternative is to use Cython's NumPy header (`local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython/Includes/numpy.pxd`, which all relevant extension modules include) and in addition NumPy's C headers this file depends on, which are `numpy/arrayobject.h` and `numpy/ufuncobject.h`.

I haven't tested this though; *in principle* our build system should be smart enough to deduce these indirect dependencies by itself.

So it's not impossible... ;-)

Successfully upgraded from Sage 4.5.3 (built from scratch, without renaming the directory) on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64.

`ptestlong` in progress, though I don't expect any issues (at least not caused by NumPy or this patch).

As expected, `ptestlong` passed all tests.
