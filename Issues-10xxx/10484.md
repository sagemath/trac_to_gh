Lots of the congruence subgroup code works intensively with small integers, and represents these as Python ints rather than Sage integers for speed reasons. This brought to light the following irritating bug:

```
sage: crt(int(2), int(3), int(5), int(7))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/storage/masiao/sage-4.6.1.alpha3/devel/sage-reviewing/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/sage/sage-4.6/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.pyc in crt(a, b, m, n)
   2737         return CRT_list(a, b)
   2738     g, alpha, beta = XGCD(m, n)
-> 2739     q, r = (b - a).quo_rem(g)
   2740     if r != 0:
   2741         raise ValueError("No solution to crt problem since gcd(%s,%s) does not divide %s-%s" % (m, n, a, b))

AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'quo_rem'
