New method for permutation groups generates a list of all of the cosets of a subgroup in a group.

This is intended for instructional use, to allow students to experiment with cosets (say, actually defining a product on the raw cosets).  This is a companion to #10685 and I think completes my wish-list of fundamental brute-force computations that help with teaching introductory group theory.

I had this all written using representatives from GAP, but GAP's "canonical" representatives are only guaranteed to be identical on a per-GAP-session basis.  For this reason,I couldn't get (a) predictable output, (b) subgroup as first coset, (c) coset "structure" identical to subgroup "structure", (d) doctest-able output and (e) a fairly straightforward technique for a naive check on normality.  Well, I could get almost all of that, but it got to where it was requiring about two or three times as many computations.

This will need #10685 on 4.6.2.alpha3 so it will apply properly, but there is no logical dependence.
