This is a problem I discovered when upgrading from sage-4.5.3 to a
candidate 4.6.2.alpha4.  Probably, the problem has existed for a while, it just "surfaced" or got noticed now.

The problem is that the file `sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.cpp`
is **not** recreated from the corresponding .pyx file when upgrading. This then causes a compile error.

The file `sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx`
includes (using Cython's `include` statement) `sage/ext/gmp.pxi` and the latter file was changed some Sage versions ago.

The following happens:

```
$ ./sage -b

Depends on #10233

Apply trac_10751_fix.patch

That is, first apply `trac_10233_fix_cython_include_path.patch` from the dependency and then `trac_10751_fix.patch`.

Robert's distutils-preprocessing seems to be the best way to do things, and we should investigate that once the requisite Cython-14.1 is included. 

In the meantime, I've made a small patch that fixes the dependency discovery bug (tested by touching sage/ext/gmp.pxi as above). This leaves the setup.py code in its current somewhat messy state, but I think we should go with the minimal bugfix until we can give distutils-preprocessing a try.

Also, enables parallel compile by default. I didn't even know we supported that. You can still disable it via setting the `MAKE='make -j1'` environment variable. Rebuilding the Sage library dropped from half an hour to 5 minutes ;-)

`make -j` without argument to `-j` means: use unlimited number of threads.  Therefore, the code

```
pos = MAKE.rfind('-j') 
if pos>=0: 
    nthreads = int(MAKE[pos+2:].split()[0])
```
should be changed to

```
pos = MAKE.rfind(' -j')
if pos >= 0:
    try: 
        nthreads = int(MAKE[pos+3:].split()[0])
    except ValueError:
        # If there is no argument to -j, use maximum number of threads
        nthreads = 2*cpu_count
```
In any case, the `ValueError` must be handled somehow.

Note also that I have added a space before `-j`.
