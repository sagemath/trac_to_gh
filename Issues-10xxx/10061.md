I use Sage 4.5.3

```
var('m') ; y=sqrt(m^2-1)
y(m=0)         # =I, is right
imag(y)        # =.... feels right, arctan2(0,-1)=pi when m=0
imag(y(m=0))   # =1, is right
(imag(y))(m=0) # is 0 and I don't understand why ! 
```

This was caused by the problem reported at #10064. The `arctan2()` automatic evaluation function checks if the second argument is positive, line 1062 of `inifcns_trans.cpp` in pynac:

```
		// atan2(0, x), x real and positive -> 0
		if (x.info(info_flags::positive))
			return _ex0;
```

attachment:trac_10062-doctest.patch adds a doctest to check this.
