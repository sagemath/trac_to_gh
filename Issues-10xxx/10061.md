Looks good to me.

We (i.e. you) should document somewhere very clearly the use of

```
   sig_on()
   c_function()
   sig_off()
```
vs.

```
   try:
      sig_on()
      cython_function()
   finally:
      sig_off()
```

In any case, positive review to this ticket.

The future sage-4.6.2.alpha4 :-)

For this patch, that probably means sage-4.6.2.alpha3 + #10028.
