[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

Given an elliptic curve E the method E.simon_two_descent() returns an ordered triple. This consists of a lower bound on the Mordell-Weil rank of E, an integer which is supposed to be the F_2 dimension of the 2-Selmer group of E, and list of points, generating the part of the Mordell-Weil group that has been found.

Sometimes the second entry is larger than the actual 2-Selmer rank as computed by mwrank, and predicted by BSD. The first curve I know of for which this happens is the elliptic curve '438e1' from Cremona's tables.

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('438e1')
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(0, 3, [(13 : -7 : 1)])
sage: E.selmer_rank() #uses mwrank
1
sage: E.sha().an()
1
```

The explanation for this is that `E.simon_two_descent()`, unlike Cremona's `mwrank`, does not do a second descent and therefore only determines an upper bound on the 2-Selmer rank.

It seems to me that the bug is *not* caused by failing to detect non-solubility at the real place.  In fact, Simon's script computes the same 2-isogeny Selmer ranks as `mwrank`, but deduces an incorrect 2-Selmer rank from these.

Output of `mwrank`:

The 3 in the last line, which should be the rank of the 2-Selmer group according to the documentation, is the result of computing (rank of `S^(phi)(E/Q)`) + (rank of `S^(phi')(E'/Q)`) + (rank of `E(Q)[2]`) - 2 = 1 + 3 + 1 - 2 = 3.  There must be something wrong with this formula, as it is symmetric in *E* and *E' * (in this particular case, since `E(Q)[2]` and `E'(Q)[2]` both have rank 1) while the 2-Selmer ranks of *E* and *E' * are in fact different (1 and 3, respectively).

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

That is indeed bad. The fomula (after the first descent) is indeed

 dim Sel_phi + dim Sel_phihat + dim E[2] - 2 .

this is a upper bound to dim Sel_2 and they have the same parity. But they need not be equal as the second descent in mwrank finds. The difference is a subquotient of Sha(E').

Conclusion: The output of Simon's algorithm is an upper bound on the 2-Selmer group, which is correct in parity, but not necessarily equal.

In propose that we change the documentation, for I don't image that Simon's script could give back to full answer - though I have not looked at it.
