I only see a minor linguistic issue with the use of "Ésto". Since 2010 we do not place a diacritic accent in demonstrative pronouns. As in
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Ésto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."
should be
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Esto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."

And in
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Ésto, junto con la ED, dan"
should be
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Esto, junto con la ED, dan"

Let me know if I can be of any help.

Prior to 2010, the use of diacritic accent for demonstrative pronouns "este","ese" and "aquel" was recommended whenever they could be confusion as to whether interpret them as adjective or pronoun. So, other demonstrative pronouns like "esto","eso" or "aquello" which do not have adjective counterparts never required diacritic accent.
As from 2010 revision from RAE (Real academia Española) it is discouraged even in the former case ("este","ese" and "aquel") though allowed.
These rules are common for all spanish language countries, since it's a  panhispanic work.
