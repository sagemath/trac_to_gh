I only see a minor linguistic issue with the use of "Ésto". Since 2010 we do not place a diacritic accent in demonstrative pronouns. As in
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Ésto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."
should be
"código fuente para los usuarios de Linux, OS X y Windows. Esto provee
+   a los usuarios de una mayor flexibilidad para que modifiquen el sistema."

And in
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Ésto, junto con la ED, dan"
should be
"+donde :math:`h>0` está dado y es pequeño. Esto, junto con la ED, dan"

Let me know if I can be of any help.
