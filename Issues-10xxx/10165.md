should be

Prior to 2010, the use of diacritic accent for demonstrative pronouns "este","ese" and "aquel" was recommended whenever they could be confusion as to whether interpret them as adjective or pronoun. So, other demonstrative pronouns like "esto","eso" or "aquello" which do not have adjective counterparts never required diacritic accent.
As from 2010 revision from RAE (Real academia Española) it is discouraged even in the former case ("este","ese" and "aquel") though allowed.
These rules are common for all spanish language countries, since it's a  panhispanic work.
