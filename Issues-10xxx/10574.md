Hmm... OK. Can we doctest this? Currently this just gives `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`.

I would do something similar to the docstring of `implicit_multiplication`:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: preparse('2x')
'Integer(2)*x'
sage: implicit_multiplication(False)
sage: preparse('2x')
'2x'
```
with perhaps some very mild explanation about preparse.
