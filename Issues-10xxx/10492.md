The current system of `spkg/install` setting **environment variables** like `$TERMCAP` with the version numbers of the various packages is quite bad.

In this ticket, I change `spkg/install` to create a file `spkg/Makefile` (which includes `spkg/standard/deps`) which is used as makefile instead of `spkg/standard/deps`.  Instead of using environment variables for the versions, I simply use make variables.

The shell script `newest_version` is also removed in favor of a shell function in `spkg/install`.  It gracefully handles non-existing packages.  Previously a non-existing package will not signal *any* error or warning.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment: 10492_deps_to_Makefile.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10492/10492_deps_to_Makefile.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT`

It would be nice if a shell function `newest_version()` would also be available for other spkg to check that required versions of dependencies are available. So I'd like it to be in 3rd file `install-functions` (or so) that is sourced by `install`. Perhaps with a better name, for example `requires_version(mpir,1,1,2)`...

Moreover, the current `newest_version` script does not check that it is called from `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg`. If it is called from the wrong directory, I get

```

 In this ticket, I change `spkg/install` to create a file `spkg/Makefile` (which includes `spkg/standard/deps`) which is used as makefile instead of `spkg/standard/deps`.  Instead of using environment variables for the versions, I simply use make variables.
 
-The shell script `newest_version` is also removed in favor of a shell function in `spkg/install`.  It gracefully handles non-existing packages.  Currently a non-existing package will not signal *any* error or warning.

Is the code in data/extcode/debian dead? It uses `newest_version`, but is it relevant anymore?

Otherwise, the changes here make sense, and I've been using this (via #12369) for some time now with no problems. I'll test on a few more systems, and then (pending the answer to my question) I can give it a positive review.

Well, after copying, we still have two... ;-)
