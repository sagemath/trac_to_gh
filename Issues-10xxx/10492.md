The current system of `spkg/install` setting **environment variables** like `$TERMCAP` with the version numbers of the various packages is quite bad.

In this ticket, I change `spkg/install` to create a file `spkg/Makefile` (which includes `spkg/standard/deps`) which is used as makefile instead of `spkg/standard/deps`.  Instead of using environment variables for the versions, I simply use make variables.

The shell script `newest_version` is also removed in favor of a shell function in `spkg/install`.  It gracefully handles non-existing packages.  Previously a non-existing package will not signal *any* error or warning.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
It would be nice if a shell function `newest_version()` would also be available for other spkg to check that required versions of dependencies are available. So I'd like it to be in 3rd file `install-functions` (or so) that is sourced by `install`. Perhaps with a better name, for example `requires_version(mpir,1,1,2)`...

Moreover, the current `newest_version` script does not check that it is called from `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg`. If it is called from the wrong directory, I get

```
/home/vbraun/Sage/sage/spkg/standard
[vbraun@volker-two standard]$ ./newest_version mpir
mpir-1.2.2.p2
```
on Linux and 

```
vbraun@t2:standard$ pwd
/home/vbraun/t2/sage-4.6.1-sunos-32bit-5.10-sun4v-SunOS/spkg/standard
vbraun@t2:standard$ ./newest_version mpir
```
(no output) on t2/Solaris.

It would be nicer (and more appropriate) to use `basename` (which is POSIX) in `newest_version*()`.




Any reason to *copy* `spkg/standard/deps` rather than include it by the generated `Makefile`?

Well, after copying, we still have two... ;-)

(Sage won't build with anything else but GNU `make` anyway, and this will not change in the foreseeable future, since many upstream packages rely on GNU `make` as well.)
