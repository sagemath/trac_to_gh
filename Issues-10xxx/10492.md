The current system of `spkg/install` setting **environment variables** like `$TERMCAP` with the version numbers of the various packages is quite bad.

In this ticket, I change `spkg/install` to create a file `spkg/Makefile` (which includes `spkg/standard/deps`) which is used as makefile instead of `spkg/standard/deps`.  Instead of using environment variables for the versions, I simply use make variables.

The shell script `newest_version` is also removed in favor of a shell function in `spkg/install`.  It gracefully handles non-existing packages.  Previously a non-existing package will not signal *any* error or warning.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:10492_deps_to_Makefile.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`
2. [attachment:10492_no_more_newest_version.patch] to SCRIPTS.

See also #12609: fixing the developer manual to take into account the changes on this ticket.

1) because it looks cleaner to me to have just one Makefile.

2) because I was worried about the portability of including files inside Makefiles.

Assuming that `spkg/Makefile` exists:

```
cd spkg
MAKE="make -S" make -k
```
(not tested)
