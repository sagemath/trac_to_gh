Method checks if two matrices are similar.  This is limited by the need to eventually compute a canonical form, in this case the Jordan form.

It will always compute a result for matrices over the rationals, owing to `QQbar` and can often arrive at a result of `False` without going as far as a Jordan form.

Hi Dan,

I'm a couple more time zones closer to you at the moment.  ;-)

Thanks for the rebase, this could have fallen through the cracks for a while.

As of today, I have rational canonical form (aka Frobenius form) working, so I should be able to eventually upgrade this to provide a yes/no answer over any field.

Rob

Jeroen - this can move to "needs review" once you reopen it.
