Method checks if two matrices are similar.  This is limited by the need to eventually compute a canonical form, in this case the Jordan form.

It will always compute a result for matrices over the rationals, owing to `QQbar` and can often arrive at a result of `False` without going as far as a Jordan form.

Hi Dan,

I'm a couple more time zones closer to you at the moment.  ;-)

Thanks for the rebase, this could have fallen through the cracks for a while.

As of today, I have rational canonical form (aka Frobenius form) working, so I should be able to eventually upgrade this to provide a yes/no answer over any field.

Rob

Observed mistakes fixed in small patch just added.  I built this on 4.7.1.alpha2, but it should apply on any version that the main patch is applied.

No point in adding anything to the doctests, since these errors only lengthen execution time and no reasonable doctest could tell.

Jeroen - this can move to "needs review" once you reopen it.  

Kini and Alligadi - thanks for the report!
