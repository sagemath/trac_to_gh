Since the weave package is outdated, and weave is now included in Scipy the documentation in numerical sage doesn't work anymore.

Simply altering the import statements to


```
from scipy import weave
from scipy.weave import converters
```

does the trick.

There was also an indention error in the example code.

Component: **documentation**
