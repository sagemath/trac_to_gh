The `random_prime()` function in Sage can take one, two or three arguments. But all the examples shown in the documentation or `random_prime` use only one argument. The more complex cases are not documented and not tested.

See also  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6e8d6f28c915830d?hl=en

These are the examples given.

```
        sage: random_prime(100000)
        88237
        sage: random_prime(2)
        2
```
Although some with good Python knowledge may argue the behavior with 2 or 3 arguments is documented properly, I personally think it could be clearer.

For example, I'm told:

```
random_prime(123,False)
```
would normally be written as

```
random_prime(123, proof=False)
```
It would be good with someone with decent Python knowledge to write some examples of using this function with 2 or 3 arguments.

See also #10112, where it is shown that the function hangs for certain erroneous inputs.

It should also be noted that the error message "*n must be greater than lbound *" is incorrect, and should be changed to "*n must be at least lbound*"

Fixed by #10112, please close as duplicate.
