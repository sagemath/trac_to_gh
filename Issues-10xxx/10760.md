Looks like this ticket is invalid now (v. my Sage 5.7.beta3 coverage test): 

```
knsam@PerverseSheaf:~/Downloads/sage-5.7.beta4/devel/sage/sage/gsl$ ../../../../sage --coverage interpolation.pyx 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE interpolation.pyx: 100.0% (11 of 11)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``` 

I'll put this up for review, in case, there are some parts of this patch, we could use positively.
