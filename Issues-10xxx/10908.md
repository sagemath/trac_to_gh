See #10823 for details about SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS.  We should build the docs fresh, which would be a nice test of if they had the necessary components to actually do SageTeX stuff.

That's a good idea, although of course you also need PGF/TikZ. Can we assume that anyone with a reasonable TeX setup has TikZ? Distributing tkz-graph and tkz-berge isn't too useful if lots of people don't even have TikZ.

I have a spkg that supports SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.3.1.spkg. Please review.

I do have a question about what I did in `spkg-install`: right now, when it tries to build the documentation and fails, it puts a file in the doc directory explaining the failure. But the installation fails. If someone is building Sage with SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS set, the build will fail if the documentation can't be built -- so why put the file in the doc directory saying that it failed?

I have a couple ideas for what to do and would like some feedback:

* if building the docs fails, print the "you can download the pdfs" message to stdout, instead of putting it in a file -- then the user who is trying to build Sage can see how to correct the error.

* if building the docs fails, automatically try to download the docs using wget or curl -- and if that works, don't do the "exit 1" in spkg-install so the build can continue.

Thoughts?
