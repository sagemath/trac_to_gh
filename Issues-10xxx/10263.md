In the developer documentation, in the section [Headings of Sage library code files](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files), there is an example heading stating

```
#*****************************************************************************

#                  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/
#*****************************************************************************
```

I think this should be changed to state the *version* of the GPL.  The current wording is maybe not technically wrong, but adding the version would certainly clarify things.
