In vanilla Sage 4.6.1:

```
sage: R.<x, y, z> = QQ[]
sage: C = Curve(x^2 - 2*y^2)
sage: C.is_singular()
True
sage: C.genus()
4294967295
```
I'm not quite sure how one defines the genus of a reducible variety, but I'm pretty sure that answer's not right...

(I spotted this during testing #727, but it has nothing to do with conics, of course.)
