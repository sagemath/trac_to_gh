Fixed by #10572.

Is it worth addressing such within Sage? (I personally don't think so.)

Manually changing `CFLAGS` to `-O2 ...` (just for the PARI package) might help.

(As of course upgrading Fedora or just GCC would as well... ;-) )

I don't think it's worth to special-case every broken version of gcc in Sage, espcially if the problem is fixed in newer versions of gcc.

Mike Witt reported on sage-release (for Sage 4.6.rc0) that `-O2` (`-fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer`) **didn't help** to get around this bug; setting `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` instead (which sets `CFLAGS` to `... -O0`, i.e. *completely* disables optimization) worked for him.

`-O1 ...` also **worked** for him.

A better work-around than `export SAGE_DEBUG=yes` might be to let the (preferably parallel build) fail on PARI in the first place, then install PARI with modified `CFLAGS`, and after that continue the build by re-running `make` with "better" (or unset) `CFLAGS`:

```sh
$ export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes

$ export MAKE="make -j4"  # for example; using more threads/jobs than the number
                          # of cores the CPU has is usually ok, at least if the
                          # machine has enough memory (RAM) available

$ make build  # should build all packages that do not depend on PARI, but will
              # fail for PARI

$ export CFLAGS="-O1 -fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer"

$ ./sage -i spkg/standard/pari-2.4.3*  # build/install only the PARI spkg;
                                       # _should_ work, unless the scripts
                                       # aren't yet installed

$ unset CFLAGS  # clear them, such that the packages' defaults will be used

$ make  # continue building the remaining packages and the documentation
```

If the `sage -i ...` doesn't work (because the necessary scripts aren't yet installed), one could try once again running `make build` (with unset or "normal" `CFLAGS`), then retrying the `sage -i ...`, again with the **modified** `CFLAGS` as given above, after a successful build of PARI continuing with `unset CFLAGS` followed by `make`.

Another approach (untested) which makes sure the necessary scripts are installed after the build of PARI has failed in the first place is to use the `-k` ("keep going") option of `make`, i.e. replacing

```sh
$ make build
```
above by

```sh
$ make -k build
```

(Of course one could do the same with (additional) custom `CFLAGS` for the usual build, substituting the `unset CFLAGS` by `export CFLAGS="..."`, and **pre**pending those flags to the ones used above for building PARI.)

If one doesn't want to mess around with setting and unsetting `CFLAGS` many times, here's the solution with one **very long line** to avoid this, this time **without** building in parallel:

```sh
$ make -k build  # should build all packages that do not depend on PARI, but will
                 # fail for PARI (with GCC 4.4.1)

# build/install only the PARI spkg, with "temporarily" modified CFLAGS:
$ env CFLAGS="-O1 -fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer" ./sage -i spkg/standard/pari-2.4.3*

$ make  # continue building the remaining packages and the documentation
```

Hmmm, install more RAM?

What CPU type is that? I know others have built successfully on openSUSE 11.2.

This used to be different in the good old times (and some even offered source packages IIRC). Also, Fedora / RedHat IMHO tend to include / build with "too fresh" compilers.

Perhaps we should really check the `gcc` version in PARI's `spkg-install`, and eventually switch to `-O1`, but IMHO this should be fixed upstream such that only the critical parts get built with that.

Can you report this upstream?

We consider "trial building" with limits, reducing the optimization level on failures (See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10430#comment:3 ff.)

Thoughts?

I have tested it quickly (by killing the compiler process by hand when it got stuck for a few minutes on the base3.c file), and indeed the updated version falls back to -O2, then to -O1. With -O1, GCC 4.4.1 is able to successfully build the package. So the skpg solves this problem for me :)

To see how long it takes to 'fail' twice, I will now let it run for a few hours without manual intervention.

Well, it should :-)

Try the following in a bash session:

```
$ ulimit -v
$ ( ulimit -v 1; gcc --version )
```
