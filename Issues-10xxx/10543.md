Hi Tom,

Thanks for the catch on making a copy of the matrix.  Not sure what I was thinking just then.  Your changes look real good to me.

I think your patch *includes* my changes and yours mixed together.  And some changes get applied in the echelonize routine (which really had me scratching my head).  I've tried to split out your changes and have placed a new patch that I belive has just your changes.  Except there were some double-colons needed, including one I'd forgotten.  You should give the revised patch a real close look.

Can you test the whole package?  If so, I think you'd be clear to finalize the review if everything looks OK.  It'll need my original patch and then the rebased reviewer patch.  I have tested the pair against the two affected files and viewed the HTML documentation, and that much looks good.

Thanks for taking a look at this one and making a fix.

Rob

Applied #10028 to 4.6.2.alpha3, only got one failure when applying the first of the two patches here.  Rebased that patch only, though the failure seems trivial.  All tests pass in sage/matrix2.

If this does not work, we'll go for alpha4.

Apply "v2" of original patch, then "reviewer-rebased," in that order.
