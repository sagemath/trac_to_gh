[See #15608 for a list of open simon_two_descent tickets]

```
sage: a = [1, 0, 1, -1751, -31352]
sage: F = EllipticCurve(a)
sage: K.<d> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: FK = EllipticCurve(K, a)
sage: F.gens()
[(52 : 111 : 1)]
sage: FK.gens()
[]
```
This isn't very good, because the default in Sage is proof=True, so one would expect this to be a provable result (until reading the docs of course).

Over Q, if the result is not provable an error is raised or a warning is printed, depending on the `proof` flag. This should be the same here.

I'm not sure that, when the gens() function was added over number fields at SD22, we thought it through very well.  In particular, I don't think that Simon's code necessarily passes the "proof=True" criteria (but cannot be more specific).  Except that the points it returns are points on the curve...

The output of simon_two_descent() for EK is

```
sage: FK.simon_two_descent()
(1, 1, [])
```
which can be interpreted as follows:  he computes the 2-Selmer rank is 1, which gives a valid upper bound for the rank (=1).  He fails to find points on 2-coverings, so there are no points returned.  *But* he uses the parity conjecture to increase the lower bound from 0 to 1.

So when we decide (in the simon_two_descent()) method) that the output is certain, we need to take this into account.

Secondly, the gens() function for curves over number fields is completely reckless:

```
        lower,upper,gens = self.simon_two_descent(verbose=verbose,lim1=lim1,lim3=\
lim3,limtriv=limtriv,maxprob=maxprob,limbigprime=limbigprime)
        return gens
```
There is no caching, no checking of Proof, and worst of all, the gens which are returned have not been looked at at all.  Just about all you can say about them is that they are points on the curve.

Who let that in?  This function needs changing urgently.

I think 3) is covered in ticket #8829. So it does not really make sense to do duplicate it here. 
I don't think we should raise an error or a warning for a documented behaviour as in 2). So I would say:

either this ticket can be closed as in 1) in case the documentation is clear enough about the current behaviour or otherwise it should improve it.

or it is a suggestion to improve the gens function. It should run gens first in subfields (where it is much easier to run) and then put the resulting sets cleverly together.

The documentation currently also says \"Check `rank()` or `rank_bounds()` to verify the number of generators\", which is somewhat misleading because even if `E.rank() == len(E.gens())` nothing is guaranteed except that the points have infinite order, so you don't really verify anything by just comparing the two numbers.\n> So I would say:\n> \n> either this ticket can be closed as in 1) in case the documentation is clear enough about the current behaviour or otherwise it should improve it.\n\nThe documentation can be improved in any case; even if we can do better in `gens()` for some curves, we are certainly far away from always returning a basis for the Mordell-Weil group modulo torsion, so documentation improvements will not be made redundant by the other option:\n> or it is a suggestion to improve the gens function. It should run gens first in subfields (where it is much easier to run) and then put the resulting sets cleverly together. \n\nThere are quite a few things one could try, e.g.\n- to find a suitable base field, start with the field generated by the coefficients of the Weierstrass model, and then possibly try to descend to a smaller field\n- try to reduce the base field even more by finding an *isogeny* to an elliptic curve defined over a smaller field\n- for a quadratic extension *L*/*K* and a curve *E*/*L* already defined over *K*, compute M-W generators of *E*/*K* and of its twist by the extension *L*/*K*\nHow about just clarifying the documentation in this ticket and opening a new ticket for these actual improvements to `gens()`?",

Replying to [wuthrich](#comment%3A11):

OK, I agree (I hadn't seen #8829).
> I don't think we should raise an error or a warning for a documented behaviour as in 2).

In that case I think it would be good to explicitly say that this is different from the function `gens()` for elliptic curves over **Q**.  The documentation currently also says "Check `rank()` or `rank_bounds()` to verify the number of generators", which is somewhat misleading because even if `E.rank() == len(E.gens())` nothing is guaranteed except that the points have infinite order, so you don't really verify anything by just comparing the two numbers.
> So I would say:

The documentation can be improved in any case; even if we can do better in `gens()` for some curves, we are certainly far away from always returning a basis for the Mordell-Weil group modulo torsion, so documentation improvements will not be made redundant by the other option:
> or it is a suggestion to improve the gens function. It should run gens first in subfields (where it is much easier to run) and then put the resulting sets cleverly together. 

There are quite a few things one could try, e.g.
- to find a suitable base field, start with the field generated by the coefficients of the Weierstrass model, and then possibly try to descend to a smaller field
- try to reduce the base field even more by finding an *isogeny* to an elliptic curve defined over a smaller field
- for a quadratic extension *L*/*K* and a curve *E*/*L* already defined over *K*, compute M-W generators of *E*/*K* and of its twist by the extension *L*/*K*
How about just clarifying the documentation in this ticket and opening a new ticket for these actual improvements to `gens()`?

It is quite a long chain of dependencies: #10745 <- #10735 <- #9322 <- #16009 <- #16022 (plus #9322 <- #16011).  I'm not sure if explicitly listing all of these makes it clearer.

All dependencies get in via #10735, so one way to do it is to create a local branch for #10735 and type `git diff --color ticket/10735 ticket/10745` (replace `ticket/10735` and `ticket/10745` with the branch names you use).

Good point; usually I number the branch name, but it could indeed be useful to put the ticket number in the commit message as well.

Thanks for the review!

Denis Simon writes this in the documentation of `ell.gp`:

```
  La fonction bnfellrank() accepte toutes les courbes sous la forme
  [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6]
  Les coefficients peuvent etre entiers ou non.
```
One of the first things that the GP function `bnfellrank()` does is indeed clearing denominators.  (The specialised functions for the three possible 2-torsion structures do require an integral model, but we don't call those directly.)

You mean for extracting a set of linearly independent points, or for the trick of looking over smaller fields first?  I can open a ticket for each of those.  The one for saturation is #8829.

Well, I guess saturation (using the height pairing anyway) should filter out the linearly dependent points too. I was rather thinking of the other issue. Maybe a simple thing would be to pass on the gens when using `base_extend`. The more advanced "looking over smaller fields" seems too utopian.

Actually the current patch at #8829 requires the initial points to be linearly independent; it even has a doctest showing that it fails for linearly dependent points...  It is probably better to fix this *after* #8829, though.
> I was rather thinking of the other issue. Maybe a simple thing would be to pass on the gens when using `base_extend`. The more advanced "looking over smaller fields" seems too utopian.

OK, then I will open a ticket to fix at least the following (inspired by the original problem):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0,1,-1751,-31352])
sage: K.<d>=QuadraticField(5)
sage: E.gens()
[(52 : 111 : 1)]
sage: E.base_extend(K).gens()
[]
```

I think this is part of the patch at #8829.
