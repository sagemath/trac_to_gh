Consider a multivariate fraction F, mixing parameters and variables
(or possibly just an Eliot fraction, where the denonimators are
binomials). The Omega operator applied on F returns the constant term
of F, under the form of a fraction in the parameters.

A typical application of this tool is to build the generating function
for all the solutions to a system of Diophantine linear equation. It
has also been used in many papers to build closed form formula for
generating series.

- [http://www.combinatorics.net.cn/homepage/xin/maple/Ell.rar Maple implementation](http://www.combinatorics.net.cn/homepage/xin/maple/Ell.rar Maple implementation)
  by Guoce Xin who realized that Laurent series were the appropriate
  setup for this problem, both conceptually and to derive efficient
  algorithms using explicit partial fraction decomposition, together
  with subtle heuristics for controlling the number of terms ([2];
  see also Zeilberger opinion [3]).

  fractions to any rational fraction [3]

  The link also point to Wiesinger's master thesis on the topic.

  The only reason to mention it here is for the attempts at using
  proper data structures and object orientation; it is my bet that
  those could eventually yield not only much more readable code, but
  also eventually faster. However at this point the heuristics are
  improperly fine tuned, and the code darn slow.
