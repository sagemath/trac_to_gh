<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I just noticed these weak error messages the other day - it'd be great to have all the cases of non-invertible matrices give a common, and informative, message.  Two suggestions:

(a)  At the sage prompt run  `search_src("ZeroDivisionError")` and I think you will find two or three more places in the matrix code that could also be improved.

(b) For Python 3 raising an error will require syntax like:

```
raise ZeroDivisionError("input matrix must be nonsingular") 
```

Might as well do it that way now.

Rob
