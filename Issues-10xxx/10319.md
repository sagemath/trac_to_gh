Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Running the code under 4.6.2 on OS X doesn't segfault but generates a TypeError for me:


```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "essai1.py", line 21, in <module>
    solution = solve_sos_equation(polynomial_ring, positive_polynomials, positive_monomial_lists, equality_polynomials, equality_monomial_lists, rhs_polynomial)
  File "<string>", line 181, in solve_sos_equation
  File "<string>", line 28, in left_near_kernel
  File "/Applications/sage_devel/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.py", line 2079, in block_matrix
    raise TypeError("invalid block_matrix invocation")
TypeError: invalid block_matrix invocation
```

However, if you load the code *again*, it crashes: the second time's the strange.

This is the smallest test case I can come up with:

```
sage: m = Matrix(QQ, [1], sparse=True)
sage: m.echelonize()
sage: m
[1]
sage: m = Matrix(QQ, [1], sparse=True)
sage: m.echelonize()
sage: m


------------------------------------------------------------

This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().

The problem is in /sage/matrix/matrix_rational_sparse.pyx in the function _echelonize_multimodular:

```
def _echelonize_multimodular(self, height_guess=None, proof=True, **kwds):
        cdef Matrix_rational_sparse E
        E = self._echelon_form_multimodular(height_guess, proof=proof, **kwds)
        # Get rid of self's data
        self._dealloc()
        
        # Change self's data to point to E's.
        self._matrix = E._matrix

        # Make sure that E's destructor doesn't delete self's data.
        E._matrix = NULL
        E._initialized = False
        return E.pivots()
```
E._matrix is set to NULL, while E may be a matrix that is in use somewhere else.  In the example given, it will be the identity matrix, which is cached in its parent.  During the first m.echelonize(), E._matrix is set to NULL where E is the cached identity matrix.  This will cause segfaults.  During the second m.echelonize() in the example, m._matrix is set to E._matrix and thus to NULL.

This looks real good.  I have the symptom (the reproducible segfault) on my machine and this is a cure.  And the code looks sound.  Passes all long tests on 4.7.1.alpha4.

Yes, a double-colon would be needed to set off the code block for the bug-fix-verification addition.  `sage/matrix/matrix_rational_sparse.pyx` is a total mess with regard to documentation and is not even being included in the PDF or HTML versions right now.  So I see little point in messing around with an additional patch to clean that up -- the whole file needs work.  I've put it on my to-do list.

So: positive review.
