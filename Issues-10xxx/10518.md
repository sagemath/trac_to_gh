I've inspected the package and it looks fine. I've installed it with no warning. 

I've tested it, and it works on the proposed examples. It fails to compile latex plots of some graphs with non-numeric labels, but this is unrelated to the package IMHO. The fix would be to either generate better dot code for those graphs, or configure the latex environment better or in dot2tex itself. I don't really know and will report a bug when I research a bit more.

Finally, testing the library after installing the spkg in a 4.6.1 install that I just updated I got one error that seems completely unrelated (on "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py"). A fresh install also fails on that test.

I'd say this is enough for a positive review, but be my guest.
