The Hilbert basis of a cone is useful for toric geometry since one needs to know the generators of "sigma-dual intersect M". This patch implements not necessarily reduced generators of a cone and the Hilbert basis.

This patch depends on #9918: triangulate point configurations. See tracker bug #9604 for the patch queue/dependencies.

The ray order of cones in doctests is written with for the PPL-based cones in #10140. Although the resulting Hilbert basis is, strictly speaking, correct, the doctests will not pass without #10140.

A couple little picks after glancing at it:
* No date after the last "AUTHORS" entry.
* `Cone.generators()` seems very confusing to me - I think of cones as generated by their rays. Maybe `Cone.lattice_points_generators()`? I know, it is quite long, but just `lattice_generators` or `integral_generators` are still misleading...
