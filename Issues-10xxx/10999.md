After installing the large cremona database. The following code 
shows something strange (which then causes a failure in E.integral_points()(:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: [P.curve() is E for P in E.gens()]
[False, False]
sage: [P.curve() == E for P in E.gens()]
[True, True]
```

There is no problem when the database is not installed, since then the generators are computed on E itself.  But with the database,  an isomorphism is applied to the generators on the database curve to this curve (in this case it is the identity map) and somewhere in that process E is replaced by a copy.

I have found the problem, in lines 190-199 in ell_rational_field.py.  It copies the points from the database curve in a way which does not change te curve those points lie on.

Patch on its way!

It would appear that I have made a serious error. I did run doctests, and they passed. I will admit to the possibility of having made a rookie mistake and tested the wrong copy of sage on my machine. 

Another possible explanation is that I didn't have the large Cremona database installed when I applied the patch. So I applied the patch THEN installed the database and it seems the doctests passed under those circumstances.

I'm running to tests again to see what happened.

In order to test this one should test against a Sage installation with and without the spkg database_cremona_ellcurve.  I have done that (full test of entire library).
