After installing the large cremona database. The following code 
shows something strange (which then causes a failure in E.integral_points()(:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('389a1')
sage: [P.curve() is E for P in E.gens()]
[False, False]
sage: [P.curve() == E for P in E.gens()]
[True, True]
```

There is no problem when the database is not installed, since then the generators are computed on E itself.  But with the database,  an isomorphism is applied to the generators on the database curve to this curve (in this case it is the identity map) and somewhere in that process E is replaced by a copy.

I have found the problem, in lines 190-199 in ell_rational_field.py.  It copies the points from the database curve in a way which does not change te curve those points lie on.

Patch on its way!

Really?  Both the patchbot and my personal testing seems to indicate doctest problems.  Am I missing something?
