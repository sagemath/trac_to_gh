We should wrap matplotlib's ability to add titles to axes, perhaps as an option to show.

I've attached a patch.  There is still an issue that needs to be solved, though.  In this plot:

```
plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), title='Plot of sin(x)', axes_labels=['x','y'],frame=True)
```

the title overwrites the axis label.  Maybe the axis label should be smarter here, or the plot title should be slightly adjusted up in this situation.

I added a patch which adds a doctest about the fact that

```
plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), title='Plot of sin(x^2)', axes_labels=['x','y'],frame=True)
```

should be ok (no overlap between title and axes labels). I know the doctest system won't see in the future if it is not the case, but at least the documentation will recall it.

Also added some `x^2` in title instead of `x`.

My patch needs review.

I tested ppurka patch. All tests passed on `sage/combinat/graphics.py and plot.py`. Documentation builds fine. I give a positive review to his patch.

BTW I am wondering why ppurka started from scratch instead of applying a patch over jason's one? Jason work will not appear in the log...

Thanks for the patch. That was a good catch on the typos. :) Positive review from me.

I see now what you actually meant in [comment:7](#comment%3A7). I am setting the authors as all three of us. That should be good enough.

It turns out that this happens in matrix plots as well, even with this code (because it has a frame).  See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1888/put-title-on-matrix_plot). I've opened #13625 for this.
