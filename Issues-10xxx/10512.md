We should wrap matplotlib's ability to add titles to axes, perhaps as an option to show.

I've attached a patch.  There is still an issue that needs to be solved, though.  In this plot:

```
plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), title='Plot of sin(x)', axes_labels=['x','y'],frame=True)
```

the title overwrites the axis label.  Maybe the axis label should be smarter here, or the plot title should be slightly adjusted up in this situation.

I get no problem when `frame=True` but do get the described problem when `frame=False`.

**Attachment:** [trac_10512_review-sl.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10512/trac_10512_review-sl.patch.gz)

I added a patch which adds a doctest about the fact that

```
plot(sin(x^2), (x, -3, 3), title='Plot of sin(x^2)', axes_labels=['x','y'],frame=True)
```

should be ok (no overlap between title and axes labels). I know the doctest system won't see in the future if it is not the case, but at least the documentation will recall it.

Also added some `x^2` in title instead of `x`.

My patch needs review.

I tested ppurka patch. All tests passed on `sage/combinat/graphics.py and plot.py`. Documentation builds fine. I give a positive review to his patch.

BTW I am wondering why ppurka started from scratch instead of applying a patch over jason's one? Jason work will not appear in the log...

It turns out that this happens in matrix plots as well, even with this code (because it has a frame).  See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1888/put-title-on-matrix_plot). I've opened #13625 for this.
