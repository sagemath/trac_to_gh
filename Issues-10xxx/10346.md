When computing the left eigenvectors of a matrix over the symbolic ring, Sage correctly uses the implementation in sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx, but as there is no overloaded function for the right eigenvectors, it falls back to the generic implementation in sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx, resulting in an exception:

```
sage: A = matrix(SR, [[1, 2], [2, 3]]); A
[1 2]
[2 3]
sage: A.eigenvectors_right()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: eigenvectors_left() takes no keyword arguments
sage: A.eigenvectors_left()
[(-sqrt(5) + 2, [(1, -1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2)], 1), (sqrt(5) + 2, [(1, 1/2*sqrt(5) + 1/2)], 1)]
```

This is due to the fact that in the generic case, `eigenvectors_right` is defined as 

```
sage: A.eigenvectors_right??
...
        return self.transpose().eigenvectors_left(extend=extend)
```
whereas `eigenvectors_left` does not take any arguments.

Looks real good.  Not sure how we missed not doing that as well when the left eigenvectors got straightened out.  Thanks for the contribution.

Applies to 4.6.1.alpha2, passes all tests, HTML documentation looks good, behaves as advertised.  So, positive review.
