```
As of 4.6.2.rc0, when homomorphisms of number fields are composed the 
result has type `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` rather than 
`NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens`:

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: e, f = End(K)
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.rings.number_field.morphism.NumberFieldHomomorphism_im_gens'>
sage: type(f*f)
<type 'sage.rings.morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens'>
```
Consequently, comparison fails to work correctly:

```
sage: f*f == e
False
sage: f*f
Ring endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  Defn: a |--> a
sage: e
Ring endomorphism of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
  Defn: a |--> a
```

Moreover, for relative number fields composition yields a formal composite 
map:

```
sage: L.<a, b> = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3])
sage: g = End(L)[1]
sage: type(g*g)
<type 'sage.categories.map.FormalCompositeMap'>
```
and this means that powers beyond cubes produce an error:

```
sage: g^4
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.categories.map.FormalCompositeMap' object has no attribute '_rational_'
```
Comparison for homomorphisms out of relative number fields needs fixing 
too, because they are not standard im_gens homomorphisms.

The patch deals with these issues.
