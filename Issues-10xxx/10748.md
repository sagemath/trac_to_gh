The p-adic L-function of an elliptic curve is rightfully a distribution on `Zp*`. The current code only sees its Delta-invariant part, where Delta is the group of `(p-1)`st roots of unity.

I have coded up a quick fix for this, with the help of Chris Wuthrich and drawing on some code written by Chan-Ho Kim at Sage Days 22 (see [http://wiki.sagemath.org/days22/wuthrich](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days22/wuthrich).

All tests passed. 

Here is a further example to illustrate the code. Maybe, we should add it in the docstring somewhere ?

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: lp=E.padic_lseries(7)
sage: lp.series(4,eta=1)
6 + 2*7^3 + 5*7^4 + O(7^6) + (4*7 + 2*7^2 + O(7^3))*T + (2 + 3*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^2 + (1 + 2*7 + 2*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^3 + (1 + 3*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^4 + O(T^5)
sage: lp.series(4,eta=2)
5 + 6*7 + 4*7^2 + 2*7^3 + 3*7^4 + 2*7^5 + O(7^6) + (6 + 4*7 + 7^2 + O(7^3))*T + (3 + 2*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^2 + (1 + 4*7 + 7^2 + O(7^3))*T^3 + (6 + 6*7 + 6*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^4 + O(T^5)
sage: lp.series(4,eta=3)
O(7^6) + (3 + 2*7 + 5*7^2 + O(7^3))*T + (5 + 4*7 + 5*7^2 + O(7^3))*T^2 + (3*7 + 7^2 + O(7^3))*T^3 + (2*7 + 7^2 + O(7^3))*T^4 + O(T^5)
```

The last vanishes at T=0, which is good, because it corresponds to the positive rank over sqrt(-7):

```
sage: E.quadratic_twist(-7).rank()
1
```

This proves that E has rank 1 over Q(zeta_7).
