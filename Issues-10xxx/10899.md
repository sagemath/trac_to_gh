See trac #8284.  The above also causes problems for is_interval, which at one point tries "if not self.is_chordal()".

OK, this was quite easy -- the problem was that lex_BFS fails to generate correct tree. If we consider Graph(1), lex_BFS correctly computes order [1], but as a tree it return empty DiGraph, where it sould return DiGraph(1). Then is_chordal fails, because it asks for order of the vertex 1, that is not in the DiGraph. It is somehow unfortunate that out_degree function couldn't detect this problem and respond with a more apropriate error message.

So, why does lex_BFS fail to construct the proper tree? It takes the proper edges and adds them to the empty DiGraph. But that is not sufficient when the tree shouldn't contain any edges, as it is in the case of Graph(1). So the whole patch I wrote consist of single line, that adds vertices to the newly created tree too.

I tried to run the crash test code from the ticket description and it didn't find any failing case.

please could you add also as doctest the example from the description?

```
sage: Graph(1).is_chordal()
True
```

Note: one could wonder whether `0 vertices` should be `0 vertex` below:

```
sage: Graph().lex_BFS(tree=True) 
([], Digraph on 0 vertices)
```

Note 2: while reviewing that ticket I discovered that the syntax `Graph(n)` was not
