I was wondering why it took so much longer to get a diamond bracket operator on a cuspidal supspace then a hecke operator. I dived into it, and the difference is, that for hecke operators it is not checked if the cuspidal subspace really is a subspace but for diamond bracket operators it is checked.

The example below sows the possibillity of a large speed improvement since the theory already tells that the diamond bracket operators will also act on the cuspidal subspace.

```
sage: M=ModularSymbols(Gamma1(97),sign=1)
sage: S=M.cuspidal_submodule()
sage: d=M.diamond_bracket_operator(3).matrix()
sage: time d.restrict(Smod,check=False)
CPU times: user 0.42 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 0.50 s
Wall time: 0.68 s
345 x 345 dense matrix over Rational Field
sage: time d.restrict(Smod,check=True)
CPU times: user 74.42 s, sys: 0.52 s, total: 74.94 s
Wall time: 75.42 s
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Dear Maarten, 

This is going to conflict rather severely with my patch at #10451, which (as well as adding all sorts of other functionality) changes the way diamond operators are implemented -- I made them into *elements* of a Hecke algebra, rather than the previous implementation as Hecke algebra *morphisms*, which I find quite strange!

I'd be really grateful if you wouldn't mind taking a look at #10451; if that gets a positive review, then we can do a new patch for this one depending on it, and I'll review it so both can go in the next release.

Depends on #10451
Apply trac_10553.patch

With #10451 installed it's just a case of adding "check=False" in one line of code. Hence the new patch. Obligatory timings:

```
# Before
sage: S = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(97),sign=1).cuspidal_submodule()
sage: time S.diamond_bracket_matrix(3)
CPU times: user 62.15 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 62.18 s
Wall time: 62.17 s
345 x 345 dense matrix over Rational Field
```

```
# After
sage: S = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(97),sign=1).cuspidal_submodule()
sage: time S.diamond_bracket_matrix(3)
CPU times: user 7.40 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 7.42 s
Wall time: 7.42 s
345 x 345 dense matrix over Rational Field
```
