This seem to have been fixed between Sage 4.6.0 and Sage 4.6.1 (Maxima was updated meanwhile)

On 4.6.0 I've got a similar problem, but everything is fine on 4.6.1:

```
sage: var('n')
n
sage: sum (n^3 * x^n, n, 0, infinity)
-(x^3 + 4*x^2 + x)/(-x^4 + 4*x^3 - 6*x^2 + 4*x - 1)

```
If someone could confirm that, I guess the ticket can be closed.

Oops, my patch is indeed wrong because I use a modified version of pynac.

I just checked with the standard spkg and got the same result as you.

So you got the correct expression and I'll attach a correct patch right now.
