zodb only use the pickle protocol version 1. It is also not used in sage apart from one package that has been migrated away from it in #12205.

There is a zodb mailing list discussion related to the pickle protocol here:  http://www.mail-archive.com/zodb-dev@zope.org/msg04628.html

In particular, pickle protocol 1 is hardcoded.  But SageObjects/Cython objects must use protocol 2 in many cases:

```
sage: import cPickle
sage: F = factor(12)
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=0)
TypeError: can't pickle SageObject objects
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=1)
TypeError: can't pickle SageObject objects
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=2)

```

See also the related ticket #10352.

The suggested option for this ticket is to remove zodb from sage.
