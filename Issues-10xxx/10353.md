zodb only use the pickle protocol version 1. It is also not used in sage apart from one package that has been migrated away from it in #12205.

There is a zodb mailing list discussion related to the pickle protocol here:  http://www.mail-archive.com/zodb-dev`@`zope.org/msg04628.html

In particular, pickle protocol 1 is hardcoded.  But SageObjects/Cython objects must use protocol 2 in many cases:

```
sage: import cPickle
sage: F = factor(12)
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=0)
TypeError: can't pickle SageObject objects
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=1)
TypeError: can't pickle SageObject objects
sage: cPickle.dumps(F, protocol=2)
'\x80\x02csage.structure.factorization\nFactorization\nq\x01)\x81q\x02}q\x03(U\x12_Factorization__crq\x04\x89U\x14_Factorization__unitq\x05csage.rings.integer\nmake_integer\nq\x06U\x011\x85Rq\x07U\x18_Factorization__universeq\x08csage.rings.integer_ring\nIntegerRing\nq\t)Rq\nU\x11_Factorization__xq\x0b]q\x0c(h\x06U\x012\x85Rq\rK\x02\x86q\x0eh\x06U\x013\x85Rq\x0fK\x01\x86q\x10eub.'
```

See also the related ticket #10352.

The suggested option for this ticket is to remove zodb from sage.

OK it is really a pain on sage-on-gentoo side and will become worse in a few months (removal from the main tree, zope maintenance is apparently hard that it will be put in its own repo for people who are interested in it).

So I am putting my hand up to remove zodb from sage. Anything else apart from conway polynomial database needs to be cleaned and converted to sqlite?
