This patch implements a Cython version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm currently available in Sage. Both stay implemented, as the Cython version only deals with unweighted graphs, and prefers to add integer values than Python objects anyway.

The performance improvement is obvious for the ``all_pairs_shortest_path`` method which used by default the Python implementation



The new implementation is now the default.

Meanwhile, the method ``distance_all_pairs`` which already used Cython code is not always improved 

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs()
625 loops, best of 3: 660 µs per loop
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="Floyd-Warshall")
625 loops, best of 3: 263 µs per loop

sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(20,20)
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs()
5 loops, best of 3: 951 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="Floyd-Warshall")
5 loops, best of 3: 3.08 s per loop
```

Hence the default behaviour of this method does not change, the two algorithms being made available.

I'm not sure I follow the argument: it does return something, and it's even documented... Maybe call it '_floyd_warshall' if you don't want the user to access it.

I might be wrong but it seems to me Sage convention is to prefer methods instead of functions. Jason, Robert, Minh, any preference on this matter?

Great, and it even removed a bug ;)
