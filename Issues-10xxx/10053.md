This patch replaces the comparison member function in `CoordinatePatch` and `DifferentialForms` by equality checking (`__eq__` instead `__cmp__`), as there is generally no canonical way of making sense of the comparison between instances of those classes.

This is related to #10041.

With this patch and the one at #10041, sage passes all (`-long`) doctests (linux, Red Hat Enterprise).

At #10041, jason [commented](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10041#comment:3) that comparison of tuples of symbolic variables is not well-defined, and suggested using strings instead.  That has been done in `coordinate_patch.py` and `differential_forms.py`, but not in `differential_form_element.py` -- there, comparison uses `__dict__`.  So is the following expected to work on all systems?

```
sage: F = DifferentialForms(); F
Algebra of differential forms in the variables x, y, z
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: f = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: f[1,2] = x; f
x*dy/\dz
sage: g = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: g[0, 2] = y
sage: g[1, 2] = 2*x; g
2*x*dy/\dz + y*dx/\dz

sage: f == g
False
sage: g == g
True
```

Note:

```
sage: g.__dict__
{'_components': {(1, 2): 2*x, (0, 2): y}, '_degree': 2}
sage: f.__dict__
{'_components': {(1, 2): x}, '_degree': 2}
sage: type(g.__dict__['_components'][(0,2)])
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

Before we move on with this, would you mind doing a little checking to see if converting to strings really is the best way to compare symbolic expressions? (If it is, then I would say '`==`' is broken for symbolic expressions.)\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, the comparison code in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` just calls `_richcmp_` in `sage/structure/element.pyx`, which seems fine.  After reading the bug reports here and in #10041, I thought the issue was that writing anything like `x == 0` merely defined a symbolic equation (instead of evaluating directly to something boolean).  I could understand this (and I think it is the intended behavior, no?), so I changed all symbolic comparisons to comparisons of string expressions, or wrote something like `(lhs - rhs).is_zero()`, although the latter seems to be slower.  \n \n\nI would love to get to the bottom of this.

> Does it really!?  Thinking more about this last night, I started to wonder if this is really a bug with comparison of symbolic expressions, not with differential forms.  Before we move on with this, would you mind doing a little checking to see if converting to strings really is the best way to compare symbolic expressions? (If it is, then I would say '`==`' is broken for symbolic expressions.)


As far as I can tell, the comparison code in `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` just calls `_richcmp_` in `sage/structure/element.pyx`, which seems fine.  After reading the bug reports here and in #10041, I thought the issue was that writing anything like `x == 0` merely defined a symbolic equation (instead of evaluating directly to something boolean).  I could understand this (and I think it is the intended behavior, no?), so I changed all symbolic comparisons to comparisons of string expressions, or wrote something like `(lhs - rhs).is_zero()`, although the latter seems to be slower.

As far as symbolic variables are concerned, pynac can compare then.

Currently it does so by comparing the underlying strings, but it could change soon because Burcin and I are working on the orders used within pynac (see http://groups.google.com/group/pynac-devel/browse_thread/thread/a36020bf9208bf08 , however you'll still get consistent equality...).

However, when using operators <, ==, etc. or `_richcmp_` you get symbolic equalities and inequalities.

You can use !__cmp!__ (symbolic/expression.pyx) or cmp to actually compare them (what is currently done by comparing strings).

If I understand correctly that calls _cmp (structure/elemet.pyx) which calls _cmp_c_impl (symbolic/expression.pyx) which calls compare of pynac (defined in libs/ginac/decl.pxi).

I don't know what is done with the tuples...

Ok, I'm ready to give this a positive review: the patch(es) pass all long doctests, documentation builds well.  Moreover, comparison of symbolic expressions is work in progress, so comparing as strings seems to be the best current solution.  jpflori suggested using `cmp` to compare symbolic expressions, but this is what lead to inconsistent behavior for comparison of tuples of symbolic expressions (see #10041).

Note that forms are appropriately simplified before comparison:

```
sage: F = DifferentialForms(); F
Algebra of differential forms in the variables x, y, z
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: sage: g = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: sage: g[0, 2] = y
sage: sage: g[1, 2] = 2*x; g
2*x*dy/\dz + y*dx/\dz
sage: g = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: g[0, 2] = y
sage: g[1, 2] = 2*x; g
2*x*dy/\dz + y*dx/\dz
sage: f = DifferentialForm(F, 2)
sage: f[0, 2] = sqrt(4)*y/2
sage: f[1, 2] = -1 - x^2 + (x+1)^2; f
((x + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1)*dy/\dz + y*dx/\dz
sage: f == g
True
```

I will also now mark #10041 as positive review.
