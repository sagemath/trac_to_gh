This was on OS X.  Same result on boxes.math.  And if I write a script that checks the exit code

```
echo "Trying stuff"
./sage -i https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10259/bad.spkg.gz
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "it failed"
fi
```
works as expected.  I believe we can close this, then?

The spkg from here fails to install (as it should). But when I insert an unknown identifier into some Cython file in my group cohomology spkg, then sage-5.9.rc0 reports success, even though of course compilation fails.

So, shall one re-open this ticket?

Volker, for one, says that my spkg-install is fine. So, I'd rather assume that it is a problem with building Cython code in an spkg.

So, I'll try to create a new bad.spkg.
