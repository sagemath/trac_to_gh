See [here](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/144) for the original request.  This is apparently also known as 'tetration'.  Having an operator for the arrow or something like that could be useful, at least pedagogically - whether Sage could actually print out such numbers is another thing!

Component: **basic arithmetic**
