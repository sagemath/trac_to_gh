The purpose of this small ticket is to add the function ``is_uniform(k)`` to the WordMorphism class. A morphism `m` is called `k`-uniform if for every letter `a`, we have `|m(a)| = k`.

For instance, the Thue-Morse morphism `a->ab,b->ba` is 2-uniform while the Fibonacci morphism `a->ab,b->a` is not uniform.

I just uploaded a review patch which, I believe, improves the code.

Other than that, documentation builds fine, all test pass, the new function is OK. If you agree with my small fixes, you can change the status of this ticket to positive review.

Hi, Sébastien !

Thank you for the review. Once again, you improved the efficiency of my algorithm (I definitely need to be more careful about these small optimisations).

I applied your patch over mine applied over sage-4.6.2 and all tests passed, and the documentation built fine too. Of course, I agree with them, so that I'm ready to set this ticket to positive review.
