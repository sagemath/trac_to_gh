The purpose of this small ticket is to add the function ``is_uniform(k)`` to the WordMorphism class. A morphism `m` is called `k`-uniform if for every letter `a`, we have `|m(a)| = k`.

For instance, the Thue-Morse morphism `a->ab,b->ba` is 2-uniform while the Fibonacci morphism `a->ab,b->a` is not uniform.

Hi, Sébastien !

Thank you for the review. Once again, you improved the efficiency of my algorithm (I definitely need to be more careful about these small optimisations).

I applied your patch over mine applied over sage-4.6.2 and all tests passed, and the documentation built fine too. Of course, I agree with them, so that I'm ready to set this ticket to positive review.
