<div id="comment:0"></div>

Newforms of level Gamma1(N), or GammaH(N) (after #8716), are always eigenforms for the diamond operators (i.e. they have a nebentypus Dirichlet character) but we don't at present have any way of calculating it. 

(This ticket is subsumed in #10451).

Component: **modular forms**

Keywords: **newform dirichlet character**
