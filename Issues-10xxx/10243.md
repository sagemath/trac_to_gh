As was noted at #9487, Sage has historically had various lists of supported platforms, with no two agreeing with each other. It was decided on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97acf2e897d10fb9/778e836a8209bc70?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=supported+platforms#778e836a8209bc70) that the list would be maintained on a web page, with fully supported platforms only those on which we regularly test Sage with a buildbot. 

This updated README.txt just reflects this, removing detailed information about supported platforms, and instead directing the reader to look on the web at 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms

It also lists an errata page, where we can document any major issues with a release

http://wiki.sagemath.org/errata

'''Since README.txt is not under revision control, the attached README.txt just needs to replace the current one. The unified diff is just to make reviewing easier - this file should not be marged'

I've corrected the typo. I'm leaving this as positive review, as there no point in getting it reviewed again for such a minor typo. 

> +1, Lets finally get this cleaned up. 

Yes, this has been annoying me for some time, as you well know. There are still other pages with outdated information. For example

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

though it points to 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms

which is why I decided to make that the official list. 

Things are even worst if you look at 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/inclusion.html

where for example it says:

* New packages must build on Microsoft Windows with MSVC 2005/Intel Fortran (MinGW or Cygwin support is insufficient!)
* New packages must build with Sun Forte 12. 

Clearly that page in the Developers Guide needs a **lot** of cleaning up, but that will be on another ticket. 

 == Note to the release manager ==
The top-level README.txt is not under revision control, so README.txt just need to be replaced with this one, which is actually a bit smaller than the old one, as there's no longer an endless list of platforms. 

The unified diff file was only to aid reviewers - it should not be merged. 

Dave

Andr√© Apitzsch, thank you for reviewing this. 

It would help if you added your username and real name at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ so we know the real names of those commenting on tickets and making reviews. That's why I set the reviewer field to *aapitzsch (who?) and Robert Bradshaw* as I had no idea of your real name. 

Jereon, yes I can understand the preference for diffs. The point I tried to make, (not very successfully), is that this was not a normal Mercurial patch. Anyway, thanks for merging it. All I need do now is find the other places where there are outdated lists of supported platforms.
