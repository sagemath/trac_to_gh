`spkg/pipestatus` does not appear in binary distributions, but #9799 introduces the use of `pipestatus` in the top-level Makefile as well.

Also, `./sage -i ...` etc. (i.e., `sage-sage`) should make use of `pipestatus`, cf. #9811.

Dependency: #9799

If you thrust the author of the patch to do the test, I am doing the following:
* building Sage from source with #9799, #10156, #10157 applied and makefile renamed to Makefile
* making an sdist and a bdist from this built Sage
* extract the sdist, make, make ptestlong
* extract the bdist, make ptestlong

If all this works, I think that #10156 and #10157 are proven to work.
