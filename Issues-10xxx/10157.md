If you thrust the author of the patch to do the test, I am doing the following:
* building Sage from source with #9799, #10156, #10157 applied and makefile renamed to Makefile
* making an sdist and a bdist from this built Sage
* extract the sdist, make, make ptestlong
* extract the bdist, make ptestlong

If all this works, I think that #10156 and #10157 are proven to work.
