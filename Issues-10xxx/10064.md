<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
Simpler example:

```
sage: (I*I)._is_positive()
True
sage: I*I
-1
```

The `is_positive()` test in pynac is at line 923 in numeric.cpp:

```
    case PYOBJECT:
      n = is_real() && (PyObject_Compare(v._pyobject, ZERO) > 0);
      if (PyErr_Occurred()) 
	py_error("is_positive");
      return n;
```

We use the python comparison. Unfortunately, this doesn't work as expected for number field elements:

```
sage: m = (I*I).pyobject()
sage: m.parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: m > 0
True
sage: m
-1
```
