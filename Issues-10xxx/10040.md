The `sage-spkg` script runs `tar` with the `v` option to extract spkgs.  This significantly increases the size of many installation logs.  Not adding the option would make the logs easier to navigate and search for errors and warnings, too.

I think Leif Leonhardy proposed this, somewhere.

Are there good reasons to keep the verbose non-error output?

Smaller logs would also help with #3524.

I've not objections to adding an environment variable to control it, but it's more work than a one-character patch!

That was meant a joke. (I don't expect people to read the full, nearly 300,000-lines `install.log`, but incidentally noticed the mentioned obsolete SageNB files when watching the build process.)

Of course. Unfortunately it's unlikely people look into the Mercurial repository for **deleted** files. (Ok, you can see them when verbosely unpacking an spkg manually, or do `du -sh` on the spkg's directory, which a reviewer should perhaps also do.)

Obviously, but shouldn't carry much more of a danger.

Btw, #9799 is also related (in case of build errors), since without that running `make` will also attempt to build the documentation regardless if the build succeeded or not, and obscure (and unnecessarily grow) the log or even "hide" the build error.

(Build errors do not always cause failures in building the documentation, so it might look as if the whole build succeeded, which probably William meant by *"leading to all kinds of confusion"*.)

So it's perhaps more worth addressing that in those spkgs that produce a huge number of such lines. There's a "verbose" option to distutils' `setup()` which is enabled by default (and also a "quiet" one), but I think we only want to suppress the verbose *copying*, so we'd have to configure just that command.

Oh, the *"copying ..."* messages appear to be a distutils **bug**; `distutils.file_util.copy_file()` has a `verbose` (default: 0) parameter, but doesn't use it!

If I change it to the following:

```python
    ...
    if verbose: # added just this line
        if os.path.basename(dst) == os.path.basename(src):
            log.info("%s %s -> %s", action, src, dir)
        else:

    ...
```
the *"copying ..."* messages vanish at least for mpmath (I only tried that so far).

Opinions? (before I open a ticket for that)

Not a bad idea. I vaguely remember what I had in mind for the "global" log and parallel builds: Since our "deps" Makefile does nothing but call `sage-spkg`, we can move the logging (i.e. the use of `pipestatus`) there, just passing in addition the name(s) of the logfile(s) in the Make rules.

`sage-spkg` can then take control of what (and how much) to log where (depending on command line options and/or environment variables), e.g. not `tee`ing but just redirecting the output of `spkg-install` to the logfile, and printing short messages to stdout on parallel builds.

This works fine for me on OpenSolaris, and I can't possibly see it would be platform dependent. 

However, the meaning of `SAGE_SPKG_LIST_FILES` should be added to the installation guide, along with the other environment variables. 

I think in many cases one might want to set  `SAGE_SPKG_LIST_FILES=yes` when installing a particular package. i.e.

```
$  export SAGE_SPKG_LIST_FILES=yes
$ ./sage -f somepackage.spkg
```

or something like that. As such, I think `SAGE_SPKG_LIST_FILES` should be documented in the installation guide, which will need another patch.

You previously said you were happy with just removing the "v"... ;-)

Though the installation guide really needs work (it is fairly out-dated), I've in addition only reformatted one paragraph to (less than) 80 columns and moved the description of `CFLAG64` up s.t. it's now immediately below that of `SAGE64`, where it IMHO belongs.

[It](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s.t.) does *not* mean *"sine tempore"* (nor *"subject to"*)...

Of course I can change that.

Suppressing the *copying...* messages sounds good to me.  Should we have an option to enable them?

Should we use suppress "tarbosity" in `sage-bdist`, too?

> Suppressing the *copying...* messages sounds good to me.  Should we have an option to enable them?

I have a patched Python package here that currently only adds the `if verbose:`.

Unfortunately, setting `distutils.log`'s verbosity level (before calling `setup()`) seems to not work for some reason. It's not clear what the `verbose` parameter is supposed to change, and apparently it isn't [always] passed to `copy_file()`.

There's always `DISTUTILS_DEBUG` btw. ;-)

We could make use of Sage environment variables (e.g. `SAGE_DEBUG_BUILD`, or `SAGE_DISTUTILS_VERBOSITY_LEVEL`) directly there, enabling more output. But I think keeping the other messages of the same verbosity level (like "*creating ...*" etc.) is ok, I'm not sure about "*moving ...*" of which we also have a lot, but by far not that many.

Did I already tell the `install.log` size drops to less than the half with non-verbose untarring and "copying" messages suppressed? (Also quite significantly depends on the length of `$SAGE_ROOT`...)

> Should we use suppress "tarbosity" in `sage-bdist`, too?

Less important, at least to me.

IMHO, this ticket has positive review and should be merged unchanged.
