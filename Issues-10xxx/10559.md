```
The first line of `/usr/bin/gphelp` has the path
to perl hardcoded rather than using 

`/usr/bin/env perl`.

This can be a problem at sites where perl is kept in a non-standard location.

Actually, the path to `perl` is not hardcoded, the first line of `gphelp` is written when PARI is installed.  So is there still a problem then?

I guess you're right.  Anyway, it's a trivial fix to replace the first line of `doc/gphelp.in` by `#!/usr/bin/env perl`, but this should be included in #10430.

Unfortunately some of the other files use

```
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
```
and there is no easy `env` replacement for that.  Since `-w` only enables warnings, we could just remove that switch, but I don't think that's such a good idea.  Suggestions?
