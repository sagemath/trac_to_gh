In some places (e.g. #8495), `sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_string` is being used as a safer alternative to `sage_eval`.  However, it does not seem to support numbers with arbitrary precision.  It should.

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_string as sefs
sage: pi_on_two = '1.57079632679489661923132169163975144209858469968755'
