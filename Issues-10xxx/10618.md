```
Since David Perkinson's sandpile module (for studying the Abelian Sandpile Model; see for example: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld_sandpile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld_sandpile) or [http://people.reed.edu/~davidp/sand/](http://people.reed.edu/~davidp/sand/)) is already written as a properly formatted Sage module it makes sense to include it in the Sage library.

This module involves a variety of mathematics so it is added in its own module.

Some parts of the module require 4ti2, currently an experimental package (but there is no reason it can't be at least an optional package), but this can be explained in the relevant docstrings.  Currently the 4ti2 package at:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/4ti2-1.3.2.p1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/4ti2-1.3.2.p1.spkg)
is best to use.

In case any mathematical justification is needed, this model is of considerable and rising interest.  For example, at the joint math meetings in 2011 there was a talk by Yuval Peres of Microsoft Research surveying it: [http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2125_abstracts/1067-a0-38.pdf](http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2125_abstracts/1067-a0-38.pdf).

OK, all tests pass for me now and the coverage is 100%.

The only problem that I see now is how to deal with namespace issues.  I think classes like "Divisor" have too general a name to get imported into Sage at the top level, which is what this patch currently does.  I see three alternatives at least:

1) Rename functions and classes to be clearly sandpile specific.  E.g., rename the Divisor class to something like SandpileDivisor.  

2) Don't import this module into the namespace at all, so users would have to do: 

```
sage: from sage.sandpiles import * 
```
themselves.

3) Import the module in its own namespace, so for instance you would have to do:

```
sage: S = sandpiles.complete_sandpile(4)
```

I would rank these as 1 > 2 > 3, but this is an important decision since it will be a pain to change later.

I agree. I actually suggested this when David P was asking for suggestions
years ago in reply to his post asking for comments on a first version.

To be more precise, the instuctions on installing 4ti2 given in the
docstrings to this module fail. If you instead use the instructions 
given in http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8217#comment:5
then 4ti2 does install fine.

I'll report back on the results of running sage -testall -optional ASAP.

Applying only trac_10618_sandpiles.2.patch to 4.6.1.rc0 on an ubuntu machine resulted in all tests passed in sage -testall. This is without 4ti2.

I think you still need
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/4ti2-1.3.2.p1.spkg
as opposed to the version on the sage webpage.
I will test this next.

Also, I think you need to add to the intro of this ticket that only the last patch need be applied.

All tests passed! Positive review, though the ticket

On which machine did you check where to write "# long time"?  It seems that most of these "long time" doctests take less than 1 second on `sage.math.washington.edu`, which means that they should not be marked "long time".

For example, this doctest on line 196::

```
sage: from sage.sandpiles import *
sage: g = {0: {},                    \
               1: {0: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1},    \
               2: {1: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1},    \
               3: {1: 1, 2: 1, 4: 1},    \
               4: {2: 1, 3: 1}}
sage: S = Sandpile(g,0)
sage: S.resolution() # long time (minutes)
'R^1 <-- R^7 <-- R^15 <-- R^13 <-- R^4'
```

Even though the test claims "minutes", in reality it takes about half a second.

Installs fine to 4.7.a1 and passes sage -testall.

Hope this stays as a positive review this time.

Thanks again Marshall for creating this.

It seems that testing this module can give enormously different timings depending on the machine.  Any clue why?

On `sage.math.washington.edu`:

```
$ ./sage -t "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
[...]
Total time for all tests: 23.7 seconds
```

But on my laptop (Gentoo Linux, Intel Core 2 Duo, gcc 4.4.3):

```
$ ./sage -t "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
```
(i.e. it takes more than 360 seconds)

Something fishy with the `sandpile.py` timings...
