Currently simplify_rational() only offers 3 Maxima methods. GiNaC offers another possibility via its normal() method. This issue is discussed here

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/843c17dcbd9c2958

I have a patch and a benchmark but need to redownload sage because I am getting unrelated doctest failures with or without the patch.

EDIT: All tests pass now with the attached patch, as they should because the default behavior is not changed. Also, I am attaching a benchmark script using random rational expressions that simplify to 1. In this benchmark, the GiNaC option is about 10 times faster than the default option (Maxima's fullratsimp, without utilizing libraryness).

One limitation of this patch is that it does not support Maxima's map option. GiNaC has a map function, but utilizing it from sage would require a bit more effort.

The `numeric::gcd()` method calls `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_gcd()`. See here:

http://pynac.sagemath.org/hg/file/b233d9dadcfa/ginac/numeric.cpp#l2526

It could be that our gcd() function doesn't work exactly like CLN's `gcd()` function which is used originally by ginac. This would effect the termination criteria used in the multivariate gcd code in ginac/pynac.

I haven't looked into the functionality in `normal.cpp` much, but one of William's goals was to make it call Singular (or the Factory library) to factor multivariate polynomials instead of the code in ginac. This library generally performs much better and it is actively being developed.

Okay, I've been contributing to the confusion. Now I see what you meant: When sage calls Pynac's normal() function, Pynac calls "its" gcd() function, which is actually sage's gcd() function. So, all the calls to gcd() are expected behavior, and the question becomes why doesn't Pynac get them over with and terminate in 30 seconds like GiNaC does with the CLN implementation of gcd()?

For reference when I switch on the statistics bookkeeping in the (latest) GiNaC source:

Bah, it was a bug in GiNaC that was fixed by this recent GiNaC commit

http://www.ginac.de/ginac.git?p=ginac.git;a=commit;h=edf1ae46a926d0a718063c149b78c1b9a7ec2043

I can bring the bug back by reverting it.

However, the patch touches code that was only added to the 1.5.x branch  of GiNaC, so we can't just apply that patch to the pynac spkg. I guess the logic that this patch fixes was also wrong somewhere in the 1.4.x branch of GiNaC. But I'm too tired and frustrated to look into it right now.

Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say gcd.

Now that there is a separate ticket for the bug in the pynac gcd, #10284, I will post my response to the other questions there.

Pynac's `normal()` was made accessible by `Expression` in #12068, so this patch can take advantage of it. The gcd error can be worked around optionally with Pynac-0.6.7 and libgiac if it is installed (#20742). This speeds up the GCD by an order of mag versus Pynac and two orders of mag versus pexpect-Maxima.
