Currently simplify_rational() only offers 3 Maxima methods. GiNaC offers another possibility via its normal() method. This issue is discussed here

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/843c17dcbd9c2958

I have a patch and a benchmark but need to redownload sage because I am getting unrelated doctest failures with or without the patch.

EDIT: All tests pass now with the attached patch, as they should because the default behavior is not changed. Also, I am attaching a benchmark script using random rational expressions that simplify to 1. In this benchmark, the GiNaC option is about 10 times faster than the default option (Maxima's fullratsimp, without utilizing libraryness).

One limitation of this patch is that it does not support Maxima's map option. GiNaC has a map function, but utilizing it from sage would require a bit more effort.

The `numeric::gcd()` method calls `sage.symbolic.pynac.py_gcd()`. See here:

http://pynac.sagemath.org/hg/file/b233d9dadcfa/ginac/numeric.cpp#l2526

It could be that our gcd() function doesn't work exactly like CLN's `gcd()` function which is used originally by ginac. This would effect the termination criteria used in the multivariate gcd code in ginac/pynac.

I haven't looked into the functionality in `normal.cpp` much, but one of William's goals was to make it call Singular (or the Factory library) to factor multivariate polynomials instead of the code in ginac. This library generally performs much better and it is actively being developed.

This library generally performs much better and it is actively being developed.\n\nDo you really want to do full factorization in `simplify_rational()`. I think neither Maxima nor GiNaC do that, only square-free factorization and gcd cancellation. We could add an option to do full factorization of the numerator  and denominator before returning. If so, would it make more sense to first backport the functionality in factor.cpp from GiNaC 1.5.x to the pynac fork than to code a pynac-libSingular link?\n\nAlso, I think this might be a bit separate from the issue I was hitting. When I ran test.sage last night under trace() with the enter key wedged down, by the morning it had called gcd() over 30,000 times and hadn't even passed the rational expression to GiNaC yet. This is a waste because GiNaC's normal() function was going to do 1 gcd cancellation anyway. So, it seems what we need is an option to prevent sage from trying to find the gcd of every subexpression.",

Replying to [@burcin](#comment:5): cc'ing William for clarification

> I haven't looked into the functionality in `normal.cpp` much, but one of William's goals was to make it call Singular (or the Factory library) to factor multivariate polynomials instead of the code in ginac. This library generally performs much better and it is actively being developed.

Do you really want to do full factorization in `simplify_rational()`. I think neither Maxima nor GiNaC do that, only square-free factorization and gcd cancellation. We could add an option to do full factorization of the numerator  and denominator before returning. If so, would it make more sense to first backport the functionality in factor.cpp from GiNaC 1.5.x to the pynac fork than to code a pynac-libSingular link?

Also, I think this might be a bit separate from the issue I was hitting. When I ran test.sage last night under trace() with the enter key wedged down, by the morning it had called gcd() over 30,000 times and hadn't even passed the rational expression to GiNaC yet. This is a waste because GiNaC's normal() function was going to do 1 gcd cancellation anyway. So, it seems what we need is an option to prevent sage from trying to find the gcd of every subexpression.

Bah, it was a bug in GiNaC that was fixed by this recent GiNaC commit

http://www.ginac.de/ginac.git?p=ginac.git;a=commit;h=edf1ae46a926d0a718063c149b78c1b9a7ec2043

I can bring the bug back by reverting it.

However, the patch touches code that was only added to the 1.5.x branch  of GiNaC, so we can't just apply that patch to the pynac spkg. I guess the logic that this patch fixes was also wrong somewhere in the 1.4.x branch of GiNaC. But I'm too tired and frustrated to look into it right now.

Sorry for the confusion. I meant to say gcd.

Now that there is a separate ticket for the bug in the pynac gcd, #10284, I will post my response to the other questions there.
