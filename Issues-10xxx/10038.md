Sage does not appear to have easily accesible analogues of Mathematica's `TrigToExp` and `ExpToTrig`.  From [AskSage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/148/complex-exponentialtrigonometric#comment-587):

```python
sage: x = var('x')
sage: t1 = cos(x)
sage: t2 = e^(I * x) / 2 / I - e^(-I * x) / 2 / I
sage: sageobj(t1._maxima_().exponentialize())
1/2*e^(-I*x) + 1/2*e^(I*x)
sage: sageobj(t2._maxima_().demoivre())
sin(x)
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

You can use `maxima_methods()` to access the maxima functions easily.

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: t1 = cos(x)
sage: t2 = e^(I * x) / 2 / I - e^(-I * x) / 2 / I
sage: res = t1.maxima_methods().exponentialize(); res
1/2*e^(-I*x) + 1/2*e^(I*x)
sage: type(res)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: t2.maxima_methods().demoivre()
sin(x)
```

I am very much against wrapping each maxima function for manipulating symbolic expressions individually from Sage. Even though maxima provides a lot of functionality, their user interface is far from intuitive. 

IMHO, the user interface to these functions should be something like:

```
sage: t1.rewrite(exp)
1/2*e^(-I*x) + 1/2*e^(I*x)
sage: t2.rewrite(sin)
sin(x)
```


BTW, it would be great if we could think about how to provide basic functionality like this directly in Sage without relying on maxima. It's possible that this requires wrapping more of pynac's features, for example

* http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Applying-a-function-on-subexpressions.html and
* http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Visitors-and-tree-traversal.html

but it's well worth the effort.

Eleven years later, it seems obvious that no one ever undertook to wrap Pynac's tree traversal utilities. However, the `expressionTreeWalker` class offers means to implement such utilities not too painfully.

This proposal passes `ptestlong` with no new failures.

```

<div id="comment:17" align="right">Comment 17</div>

A few little things:

It would be good to use Sage's doc conventions:

```diff
-        """Returns this sumbolic expression with all circular and hyperbolic
+        """
+        Return this sumbolic expression with all circular and hyperbolic
         functions replaced by their respective exponential
         expressions.
```

`Exponentialize.__init__` is missing a doctest.

The import here

```
    def demoivre(self, force=False):
        from sage.symbolic.expression_conversions import DeMoivre
        """
```
should go after the docstring (which probably is not being picked up as a docstring but instead just a string being created within the function).

```diff
-return op(*[self(_) for _ in ex.operands()])
+return op(*[self(oper) for oper in ex.operands()])
```
