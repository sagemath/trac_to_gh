This method serves two purposes:

(a) a convenience for getting singular values and clipping small values to zero.

(b) a starting point for reasonable quality control on numerical approximations from CDF matrices.  This will make a rank computation easy (though not fool-proof) and this can be used in other situations as a consistency check.  See #7392.

v2 patch rebases to depend on #10837 on 4.7.alpha3 and reworks the doctests.

One new doctest at the beginning that is a full-rank matrix (no zero singular values!) and should be stable numerically.  includes a confidence building test on correctness.

All the other matrices stay the same, including the difficult Hilbert matrix.  Using rounding liberally, plus ellipsis (...) and inequalities in a few places to get everything to behave, without obscuring the real nature of the method.

No changes to the code.  New doctests pass on my Intel i7-2600 machine and on sage.math.

The changes to the doctests should be reviewed.

I propose only one tiny change to the doctest involving the condition:
The exact value is

```
sage: c2 = sqrt(sum(map(operator.mul, B.inverse().list(), B.inverse().list())))
sage: c1 = sqrt(sum(map(operator.mul, B.list(), B.list())))
sage: c1/c2
1/338581401811897828348589105304331884576*sqrt(805082999949990227/30)*sqrt(158090646384497588170245117213)
sage: N(c1*c2)
1.75177509695064e16
```
so indeed only the first two digits of what you computed are right. I changed the doctest accordingly.

If also modified one if clause; it now checks eps is None.

If you approve the changes, we can give this a "virtual positive review", depending on the approval of #10837.

Thanks for the improved accuracy on that test.  Looks good.

Yes, let's call this "virtual positive review" and I will wait on #10837 before actually flipping the ticket.

Thanks for your careful work on these.  The improvements are welcome.

Review patch looks good, and passes long tests, and #10837 is ready-to-go.  So "positive review" here.

I made a v2 version of the review patch with a commit string, and Martin as the user.

4.7.2.alpha1 + #10837

"v3" is a very trivial rebase for fuzzieness.

Two doctests now fail  (did ATLAS change?).  "doctest-noise" patch brutally makes these failures go away, but will necessitate a review.

On which system did you see this?  On Linux x86_64 I did not get such a failure.  It is true that ATLAS did change in sage-4.7.2.alpha0.

Jeroen,

Here are the failures (these are the only ones on sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx).

So they are not too bad - an order of magnitude or so on (typically) very small values.

System is not too unusual.  At Sage Days so do not have another system to test.

Very newly installed 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10 on Intel i7 M620.
