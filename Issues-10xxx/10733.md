In the method `_echelon_in_place_classical` of `matrix_modn_sparse` there's this comment:

```
TODO: Implement switching to a dense method when the matrix gets
      dense.
```
That's what we will do in this ticket, by switching to linbox echelon form code when rows start to get non-dense.

Depends on #10734

The patch doesn't add any new functionality.

The function didn't have a doctest before.

I've attached a patch (to be applied in top of the other two) which adds a test for the sparse echelon form. The test takes about 20 seconds, so it's labeled as long.

What the test does is to construct a 1000x1000 sparse matrix with density=1%, and compute the echelon form using different values for "switch_density", and also using the dense matrix echelon form method. Of course everything should give the same echelon form. I'm not sure if it makes sense to test with smaller matrices.

In any case, feel free to add more tests or modify the current one in any way you see fits.

I replaced the patch by a new version. In the new version, I copied the test twice, so it's always run for 100x100 matrices (5% density) and optionally (long) run for 1000x1000 matrices (1% density).

The test for 100x100 matrices takes about 0.1 s, so it's ok. I think it's still a useful test since it runs the algorithm switching to dense at several different columns.

The test for 1000x1000 takes about 25 s (I changed the modulus from 97 to 997) and it's still optional (long). Is that too long for a "long" test?

Annoyingly, there are issues when the modulus is 2, e.g.:

The result of running the whole test suite:

Here is another style comment.  In Cython now doing

```
for c from 0 <= c < self._ncols:
```
is *identical* to doing:

```
for c in range(self._ncols):
```


Otherwise, everything looks great, and this is going to be *extremeley* useful for my research!!

I reviewed the new patch and ran the test suite, which passes for me as well.

The problematic method was `Matrix_modn_sparse.set_block_unsafe(..., Matrix_modn_dense m)` which is meant to set a block of a sparse matrix given by a dense matrix. But for mod 2, the dense matrices are implemented by a different class (`Matrix_mod2_dense`) so calls to `set_block_unsafe` will fail. What the reviewer patch does is to factor out a common superclass for both `Matrix_mod_dense` which can be used in the implementation of `set_block_unsafe`.

I noticed that computing echelon form for a sparse mod2 matrix is much slower than converting the matrix to dense and using echelon form (which uses M4RI and is quite fast). Thus, it could make sense to reimplement sparse mod2 echelon form via conversion to dense. However, note that conversion from mod2 dense to mod2 sparse is quite slow currently.

In spite of the above comment, I'm giving positive review to patch 4 based on:
- the code works properly for mod2 sparse matrices, so no functionality regression.
- it runs definitely faster than what we had before for sparse matrices, so no performance regression.
Since this ticket gives significant improvements for larger modulus, it's important that we merge it even if it's not the best we could do for the modulus 2.

For the record, this is what I think could be used for mod2 sparse via dense:

```
   dense = self.dense_matrix()
   dense.echelonize()
   self.set_block_unsafe(0, 0, dense)
```
The last step does the conversion from dense to sparse, and it's way faster than calling dense.matrix_sparse(), but it's still slow.

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
I added two more patches to the sequence:

- trac_10733.05: adds a doctest for the case of mod2, because it is using different code it's worth testing separately
- trac_10733.06: adds a special case to the method for the case when "switch_density" is 0.

The latter basically implements what I suggested in my last comment as part of the `_echelon_in_place_classical()` method. As is now, the default for "switch_density" is always 0.1 so this code would not be normally used. But if one explicitly uses "switch_density=0", then the method will run faster after this patch. And for the case of mod 2, it seems that it could indeed be faster to use switch_density=0 instead of the default 0.1.

I guess these two patches need to go back to review, although trac doesn't give me the option of changing the status to needs_review...

<a id='comment:22'>Comment 22:</a>
I've reuploaded all the patches with the right format (see #10734).

Also, I moved part of the referee patch to #10734, otherwise some doctests would fail if that ticket is merged without the current one.

There's no new code at all, so I assume the positive review is still valid.

---

OTOH, I screwed up filenames because (a) I made a mistake uploading one patch (b) I don't have permissions to delete incorrectly uploaded patches (c) I don't have permissions to replace the referee patch.

Whoever has the rights, what needs to be done is:
a. delete attachment  trac_10733.2.03-documentation (uploaded by mistake)
b. delete the original referee patch trac_10733.04-referee_refactor_to_support_p2.patch, and replace it by the new trac_10733.04-referee_refactor_to_support_p2.2.patch

After those two changes, the six patches are applied one after other in numerical order.
