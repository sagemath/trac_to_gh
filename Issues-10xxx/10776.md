Posets determine whether there is a top element by converting the element returned by `._hasse_diagram.top()` to a boolean.  Instead, the function should check whether the returned value is `None`.

Here is the current definition of `.top()`:

```
    def top(self):
        """
        Returns the top element of the poset, if it exists.
        
        EXAMPLES::
        
            sage: P = Poset({0:[3],1:[3],2:[3],3:[4,5],4:[],5:[]})
            sage: P.top() is None
            True
            sage: Q = Poset({0:[1],1:[]})
            sage: Q.top()
            1
        """
        hasse_top = self._hasse_diagram.top()
        if hasse_top:
            return self._vertex_to_element(hasse_top)
        else:
            return None
```

And here is an example showing how it fails:

```
sage: p = Poset([[0],[]]); p
Finite poset containing 1 elements
sage: p.list()
[0]
sage: p.top()
sage: p.top() is None
True
sage: p._hasse_diagram.top()
0
sage: p._hasse_diagram.top() is None
False
```

Well, actually I've thought about this before -- I think there was a time when the developer guide recommended it.  But when I looked into this a few months ago, I couldn't find the recommendation any more, and someone convinced me to drop it with something like the following:  Wouldn't it be strange and pointless if, many years from now, the Sage source code were filled with references to ticket numbers that are meaningless to most users?

Do you really think there's a compelling reason to mention the ticket?

Well, I stand corrected -- somehow I can't find that list when I'm looking for it; probably because I associate it with reviewing patches rather than creating them.

Oh, how embarrassing: checking back, it seems that I *wrote* that line ([#9771](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9771)).  So the new patch adds the ticket number :)

thanks for keeping me honest,
