A way of estimating the complexity of Gröbner basis computations for random systems is to consider the degree of regularity as an upper bound for the degree which will be reached. Thus, it might be helpful for multivariate polynomial ideals to have a method for computing the degree of semi-regularity.

your patch looks good. I replaced a few non-ascii characters with their ascii equivalents (text was copied from a pdf, so e.g. "fi" was one character etc.)
