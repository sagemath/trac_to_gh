A way of estimating the complexity of Gröbner basis computations for random systems is to consider the degree of regularity as an upper bound for the degree which will be reached. Thus, it might be helpful for multivariate polynomial ideals to have a method for computing the degree of semi-regularity.

I just cleaned up a few minor doc problems.  Otherwise, sage/rings tests pass and this looks good.  Martin, if you can check my patch is OK I think you can give a final positive review.

your patch looks good. I replaced a few non-ascii characters with their ascii equivalents (text was copied from a pdf, so e.g. "fi" was one character etc.)
