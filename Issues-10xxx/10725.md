The method isogeny_class() for elliptic curves over Q currently computes isogenies of prime degree between the curves in the class but then discards them.

This patch adds a parameter return_maps (boolean, default False) which is True also returns a matrix of the isogenies of prime degree (only) between the curves in the class.

When isogeny composition is implemented it will be possible to enhance this further and return a complete matrix of isogenies between any two curves in the class.  But this is already useful, for example to map generaotrs for one curve to the other curves in the class.  This is why I implemented it.
