If you choose "Delete All Output" for a worksheet that contains plots (e.g. just make a worksheet with "plot(sin(x))" in it), then all plots are removed in the sense that they are not visible anymore, but the actual file with the plot is still stored in the worksheet directory and is included into the downloaded worksheet sws-file.

This is a serious issue for worksheets that include many big plots.

Possibly related tickets: #5177, #7647.
