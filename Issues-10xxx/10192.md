```
When `SAGE_PATH` (and hence also `PYTHONPATH`) contains "`.`" (the current working directory) during the installation of `sagenb`, Python is able to find `sagenb` in its path and therefore refuses to add it to `easy-install.pth`. Later, Sage won't find it, leading to the following error message:

```
ImportError: No module named sagenb.misc.sphinxify
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.
```

This is a follow-up to #10176, and there has been some discussion on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/bb636656e2153332).

From `sage-env`:

```sh
if [ -d "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python" ]; then
    PYTHONPATH="$SAGE_PATH:$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python"   && export PYTHONPATH
    PYTHONHOME="$SAGE_ROOT/local" && export PYTHONHOME
fi
```

We shouldn't add `$SAGE_PATH` there if it is empty btw., but the removal of "`.`" from `PYTHONPATH` should be performed in `sage-spkg` I think.

(`$SAGE_PATH` is also *appended* to an overwritten(?!) `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-doctest`.)

Ok, after changing some instances of `PYTHON_PATH` to `PYTHONPATH` (argh!), the attached patch works for me.

You can try setting `SAGE_PATH` to something containing "`.`" (e.g. `":/foo/bar:.:/baz`, too), of course also doing `export SAGE_PATH`, then [re]installing the SageNB 0.8.7 spkg (or the newer ones, p1 or p2, but these aren't necessary, i.e., the patch here fixes the issue in a different way, not needing an additional work-around).

As far as I know, Cygwin (as opposed to MS DOS/Windows) also uses "`:`" to separate directories in search paths, so this should work for Cygwin as well.

(Other shell and even Python scripts in Sage also hard-code that character.)

I've uploaded a slightly improved patch, this time *really* based on *vanilla* 4.6.rc0.

Try again...

(also with `SAGE_PATH=".::./././//./://bingo//:baz:::://///:./.:."` and alike) ;-)

Although it *might* still fail with e.g. `SAGE_PATH="./foo/.."` (if `./foo/` happens to exist in the directory `setup` is run in), but this would at least for SageNB be catched by the 0.8.7.p{1,2} spkgs...

Wow, the patch still applied (with an offset of only a few lines); I've rebased it on Sage 4.7.1.rc2 despite of that to now apply cleanly.

There are currently some concurrent tickets also patching `sage-spkg` though.

The main point in the patch is the separator that is redefined to ':'.

Now when you run a loop through the variable, it loops through all the parts separated by ':'. Once each part is separated, you can check whether it is empty (hence the first test `-n "$x"`), or whether it consists of only . and / (hence the echo + sed). This is important because this catches all the bad cases like `..`, `./.`, `.`, etc. ( In relation to #11914, I tried to cd to devel/sage/sage and ran sage as `SAGE_PATH=.. sage -n` and it failed to run. So we should definitely weed out at least `..` by itself. ) I do feel that it is over-engineered, but I haven't been able to come up with a better solution that catches all the cases.

Since all the scripts in Sage are trying to conform to POSIX you need the echo + sed. In pure bash, you can replace the `"$( echo "$x" | sed ... )"` with simply `"${x//[\.\/]}"`

Well, I know `IFS`, but I don't want to run it in a loop; that was my point.

My improved code snippet (simplified and catching additional instances; using a single invocation of `sed`) looks like this:

```sh
$ echo $EXAMPLE; echo; echo ":$EXAMPLE:" | sed \
-e 's|/\+|/|g' \
-e 's|:\(\./\)\+|:|g' \
-e 's|\(/\.\)\+:|:|g' \
-e 's|\(:\.\)\+:|:|g' \
-e 's|:\+|:|g' -e 's|^:\+||' -e 's|:\+$||' 
.::./././//./://bingo//:baz:::://///:./.:.

/bingo/:baz:/
```




> This is important because this catches all the bad cases like `..`, `./.`, `.`, etc.

We only have to catch "`.`" (i.e., the current working directory) *here*.




> (In relation to #11914, I tried to cd to devel/sage/sage and ran sage as `SAGE_PATH=.. sage -n` and it failed to run. So we should definitely weed out at least `..` by itself.)

IMHO not.  If you put things into `SAGE_PATH`, you have to live with the results (or side-effects) *in that case*.  Or we have to do that in `sage-sage`, before we (try to) start the notebook only, independently of the fix to `sage-env` at #11914 (and of course `sage-spkg`, which is patched here).

A better approach in the case of the notebook would perhaps be to directly test whether any component of `PYTHONPATH` yields `devel/sage-*/` (or has a subdirectory `sage` with an `__init__.py` file in it), or, probably easiest, *prepend* the correct directory to `PYTHONPATH` before running `sage-notebook`.

(We should better discuss the latter on #11914.)

Updated the patch with the stated modifications. Please review.

Here is the output in busybox (probably the closest system to POSIX I have around here, but the earlier version also works fine):

```

BusyBox v1.18.4 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.4-2ubuntu2) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

~ $ EXAMPLE=".::./././//./://bingo//:baz:::://///:./.:."
