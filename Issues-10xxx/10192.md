When `SAGE_PATH` (and hence also `PYTHONPATH`) contains "`.`" (the current working directory) during the installation of `sagenb`, Python is able to find `sagenb` in its path and therefore refuses to add it to `easy-install.pth`. Later, Sage won't find it, leading to the following error message:

```
ImportError: No module named sagenb.misc.sphinxify
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?
WARNING: Loading of ipy_profile_sage failed.
```

This is a follow-up to #10176, and there has been some discussion on [sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/bb636656e2153332).

<a id='comment:2'></a>From `sage-env`:

```sh
if [ -d "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python" ]; then
    PYTHONPATH="$SAGE_PATH:$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python"   && export PYTHONPATH
    PYTHONHOME="$SAGE_ROOT/local" && export PYTHONHOME
fi
```

We shouldn't add `$SAGE_PATH` there if it is empty btw., but the removal of "`.`" from `PYTHONPATH` should be performed in `sage-spkg` I think.

(`$SAGE_PATH` is also *appended* to an overwritten(?!) `PYTHONPATH` in `sage-doctest`.)

Although it *might* still fail with e.g. `SAGE_PATH="./foo/.."` (if `./foo/` happens to exist in the directory `setup` is run in), but this would at least for SageNB be catched by the 0.8.7.p{1,2} spkgs...

Wow, the patch still applied (with an offset of only a few lines); I've rebased it on Sage 4.7.1.rc2 despite of that to now apply cleanly.

There are currently some concurrent tickets also patching `sage-spkg` though.

The main point in the patch is the separator that is redefined to ':'.

Now when you run a loop through the variable, it loops through all the parts separated by ':'. Once each part is separated, you can check whether it is empty (hence the first test `-n "$x"`), or whether it consists of only . and / (hence the echo + sed). This is important because this catches all the bad cases like `..`, `./.`, `.`, etc. ( In relation to #11914, I tried to cd to devel/sage/sage and ran sage as `SAGE_PATH=.. sage -n` and it failed to run. So we should definitely weed out at least `..` by itself. ) I do feel that it is over-engineered, but I haven't been able to come up with a better solution that catches all the cases.

Since all the scripts in Sage are trying to conform to POSIX you need the echo + sed. In pure bash, you can replace the `"$( echo "$x" | sed ... )"` with simply `"${x//[\.\/]}"`

Well, I know `IFS`, but I don't want to run it in a loop; that was my point.

My improved code snippet (simplified and catching additional instances; using a single invocation of `sed`) looks like this:

```sh
$ echo $EXAMPLE; echo; echo ":$EXAMPLE:" | sed \
-e 's|/\+|/|g' \
-e 's|:\(\./\)\+|:|g' \
-e 's|\(/\.\)\+:|:|g' \
-e 's|\(:\.\)\+:|:|g' \
-e 's|:\+|:|g' -e 's|^:\+||' -e 's|:\+$||' 
.::./././//./://bingo//:baz:::://///:./.:.

/bingo/:baz:/
```




> This is important because this catches all the bad cases like `..`, `./.`, `.`, etc.


We only have to catch "`.`" (i.e., the current working directory) *here*.




> (In relation to #11914, I tried to cd to devel/sage/sage and ran sage as `SAGE_PATH=.. sage -n` and it failed to run. So we should definitely weed out at least `..` by itself.)


IMHO not.  If you put things into `SAGE_PATH`, you have to live with the results (or side-effects) *in that case*.  Or we have to do that in `sage-sage`, before we (try to) start the notebook only, independently of the fix to `sage-env` at #11914 (and of course `sage-spkg`, which is patched here).

A better approach in the case of the notebook would perhaps be to directly test whether any component of `PYTHONPATH` yields `devel/sage-*/` (or has a subdirectory `sage` with an `__init__.py` file in it), or, probably easiest, *prepend* the correct directory to `PYTHONPATH` before running `sage-notebook`.

(We should better discuss the latter on #11914.)

Is `\{1,\}` a portable version of `\+`?

As far as I can tell, yes.  But I consider "XX*" to be more readable than "X\{1,\}", especially for short strings X, which is the case here.

Updated the patch with the stated modifications. Please review.

Here is the output in busybox (probably the closest system to POSIX I have around here, but the earlier version also works fine):

```
~> busybox sh


BusyBox v1.18.4 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.4-2ubuntu2) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

~ $ EXAMPLE=".::./././//./://bingo//:baz:::://///:./.:."
~ $ echo :$EXAMPLE: | busybox sed -e 's|//*|/|g' -e 's|:\(\./\)\{1,\}|:|g' -e 's
s|::*$||'
/bingo/:baz:/
```
