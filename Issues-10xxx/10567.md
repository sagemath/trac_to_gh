Parentheses (brackets) seem to break implicit_multiplication, but only in some cases. This seems to be when a non-bracketed factor is followed by a bracketed. It seems to be a problem with the preparser. Here are a few examples:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)

Working examples:

sage: (x+3)(x+4)
(x + 3)*(x + 4)
sage: (3) x
3*x
sage: 3(x+3)
3*x + 9

Non-working examples:

sage: x(x+3)
x + 3
sage: x (3)
3

Preparser does not work:

sage: preparse('x(x+3)')
'x(x+Integer(3))'
```
This is quite a major issue for implicit_multiplication.

Well,

I think that "x(x+3)" and "x(3)" will never work, since this is the syntax of function call.

If you made the preparser to transform "x(3)" to "x*3". How will you be able to use a function named x to value 3?

There's nothing wrong with either example

(5) (3*5) is still a function call and therefore invalid because "(5)" is not a function

(x+3) (x+3) - the first (x + 3) creates an expression, and then you call the expression with the argument (x + 3). So for example (x + 3)(2) would be 2 + 3 = 5, (x + 3)(y) = y + 3, and (x + 3)(x + 3) = x + 3 + 3 = x + 6

See comment 3

I am just saying that when the level is set to True, the two examples are not treated as multiplication and this is intentional. To treat them as multiplication, as you pointed out, we should set the level to 10. Anyways, I concur that we should close this ticket as wontfix.
