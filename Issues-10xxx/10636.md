From http://ask.sagemath.org/question/314/bessel-functions :

(2) There was talk a while back about making the zeros of the Bessel functions available without having to calculate them with find_root() (Not that there's a problem doing that, but it would just be a convenience.) I was just wondering if anything came of that.

Note that mpmath provides this functionality as documented at http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/bessel.html#besseljzero

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Depends on #9969 for arbitrary-precision computation with mpmath since Bessel function zeros were added in mpmath 0.16.

Note that SciPy also has (faster) double-precision Bessel function zeros.
