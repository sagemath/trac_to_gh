It would be easy for the GSL developers to check if `fprnd_t` is defined or not in the configure script. I guess if there are a large number of things that might be undefined, then it would get a bit of a headache. \n\nI think Sage gets a lot harder to maintain, and a lot easier for bugs to get missed on one platform or another with so many conditional bits of code. \n\n* We apply readline on some linux versions but not on all OpenSUSE versions\n* We use iconv on Solaris, HP-UX and Cygwin but not Linux or OS X. \n* We patch `paripriv.h` on OS X and Solaris, but in different ways. \n* etc etc etc. \n\nI prefer the `autoconf` approach of actually **testing** what is defined or not, rather than us making exceptions for this platform or that platform. \n\nLet's say I put code like:\n\n```\n   if[ \"x$UNAME = xAIX ] ; then\n      cp patches/fp-aix.c src/fp-aix.c # or wherever the file needs to go. \n   fi\n```\n\nthen I've no idea if that is necessary on anything other than AIX 5.3. I might be able to find someone to test it on the next release of AIX which is 6.1. (IBM never released a 5.4 or 6.0, so their version numbering is even stranger than Sage's, which is saying something !!)  \n\nMy 32-bit machine is too old to run AIX 6.1, which only has a 64-bit kernel. AIX 5.3 is still officially supported by IBM and will be for a couple of years. Earlier verisons of AIX are no longer supported by IBM, so it is probably not worth worrying about earlier releases. But one should consider AIX 6.1, and the soon to be released AIX 7.0. \n\nDave",

True, that is very easy to do. 

But one has to wonder why it's not taken care of in the GSL source code. It would be easy for the GSL developers to check if `fprnd_t` is defined or not in the configure script. I guess if there are a large number of things that might be undefined, then it would get a bit of a headache. 

I think Sage gets a lot harder to maintain, and a lot easier for bugs to get missed on one platform or another with so many conditional bits of code. 

* We apply readline on some linux versions but not on all OpenSUSE versions
* We use iconv on Solaris, HP-UX and Cygwin but not Linux or OS X. 
* We patch `paripriv.h` on OS X and Solaris, but in different ways. 
* etc etc etc. 

I prefer the `autoconf` approach of actually **testing** what is defined or not, rather than us making exceptions for this platform or that platform. 

Let's say I put code like:

```
   if[ "x$UNAME = xAIX ] ; then
      cp patches/fp-aix.c src/fp-aix.c # or wherever the file needs to go. 
   fi
```

then I've no idea if that is necessary on anything other than AIX 5.3. I might be able to find someone to test it on the next release of AIX which is 6.1. (IBM never released a 5.4 or 6.0, so their version numbering is even stranger than Sage's, which is saying something !!)  

My 32-bit machine is too old to run AIX 6.1, which only has a 64-bit kernel. AIX 5.3 is still officially supported by IBM and will be for a couple of years. Earlier verisons of AIX are no longer supported by IBM, so it is probably not worth worrying about earlier releases. But one should consider AIX 6.1, and the soon to be released AIX 7.0.

That's because they decided to **dynamically** link `/bin/sh` (or `/bin/bash`) against `libreadline`, which is a bad idea. So the shell might break in case a less capable version is found (first) in e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. (Proper versioning would also avoid this.)

Not true. Same patched file, just avoids a name clash with `ECHO` on those two systems. Not an upstream problem, since as the name suggests it's not intended to be installed / used outside the PARI sources.

True. ;-) (There are packages I think could and should be made prerequisites, which would avoid some trouble.)

Yes, but in general work-arounds made in Sage should be obsoleted by later upstream releases. (This is of course not always the case, and as seen above, some changes aren't upstream problems.)

> [...] I've no idea if that is necessary on anything other than AIX 5.3.

The snippet from GSL's `INSTALL` suggests it's not an AIX problem, but rather one of GCC.

I guess the GSL developers are quite within their rights to refuse to work around compiler bugs. I know the MPFR developers will not work around compiler bugs. 

I really wish I had a copy of the C standard, so knew exactly what should be defined and where.

I finally have a complete solution for the GSL problem on AIX, which not only means this now builds, but it pases all the tests too. The log file ends with:

```
The self-tests of GSL were successfully passed
```

The changes, which are only applied on AIX, consist of:

* A revised configure.ac which checks for fprnd_t
* Changes to an AIX-specific file fp-aix.c to define 'fprnd_t' 'FP_RND_RN','FP_RND_RM', 'FP_RND_RP' and 'FP_RND_RZ' if any of them are undefined. All definition were taken from the IBM header file float.h. 
* Changes to spkg-install to apply the two patches. This uses GNU 'patch' (now part of Sage) to apply the patches. 
* A new `configure` script that was generated for the updated `configure.ac`
* A change to spkg-install to disable debug information when building on AIX. This is necessary since some Technology Levels or Service packs for AIX cause a problem when linking.

**Note** All changes to spkg-install are inside sections which have

so although these changes would not cause problems on any platform, for extra security they are only applied on AIX. 

This now needs review. Sorry for the size of the Mercurial patch, but this is because there's a new configure script that's auto-generated. That is quite large.

Oops, there's a syntax error in what I just wrote in the trac, though the update .spkg file is fine.  I should have stated all changes to spkg-install are inside sections which have
