True, that is very easy to do. 

But one has to wonder why it's not taken care of in the GSL source code. It would be easy for the GSL developers to check if `fprnd_t` is defined or not in the configure script. I guess if there are a large number of things that might be undefined, then it would get a bit of a headache. 

I think Sage gets a lot harder to maintain, and a lot easier for bugs to get missed on one platform or another with so many conditional bits of code. 

* We apply readline on some linux versions but not on all OpenSUSE versions
* We use iconv on Solaris, HP-UX and Cygwin but not Linux or OS X. 
* We patch `paripriv.h` on OS X and Solaris, but in different ways. 
* etc etc etc. 

I prefer the `autoconf` approach of actually **testing** what is defined or not, rather than us making exceptions for this platform or that platform. 

Let's say I put code like:

```
   if[ "x$UNAME = xAIX ] ; then
      cp patches/fp-aix.c src/fp-aix.c # or wherever the file needs to go. 
   fi
```

then I've no idea if that is necessary on anything other than AIX 5.3. I might be able to find someone to test it on the next release of AIX which is 6.1. (IBM never released a 5.4 or 6.0, so their version numbering is even stranger than Sage's, which is saying something !!)  

My 32-bit machine is too old to run AIX 6.1, which only has a 64-bit kernel. AIX 5.3 is still officially supported by IBM and will be for a couple of years. Earlier verisons of AIX are no longer supported by IBM, so it is probably not worth worrying about earlier releases. But one should consider AIX 6.1, and the soon to be released AIX 7.0.

Same patched file, just avoids a name clash with `ECHO` on those two systems. Not an upstream problem, since as the name suggests it's not intended to be installed / used outside the PARI sources.\n\n>  * etc etc etc. \n\n\nTrue. ;-) (There are packages I think could and should be made prerequisites, which would avoid some trouble.)\n \n> I prefer the `autoconf` approach of actually **testing** what is defined or not, rather than us making exceptions for this platform or that platform. \n\n\nYes, but in general work-arounds made in Sage should be obsoleted by later upstream releases.

True.

>  * We apply readline on some linux versions but not on all OpenSUSE versions


That's because they decided to **dynamically** link `/bin/sh` (or `/bin/bash`) against `libreadline`, which is a bad idea. So the shell might break in case a less capable version is found (first) in e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. (Proper versioning would also avoid this.)

Because the assumption is that `iconv` is either broken or missing on those platforms.

Not true. Same patched file, just avoids a name clash with `ECHO` on those two systems. Not an upstream problem, since as the name suggests it's not intended to be installed / used outside the PARI sources.

True. ;-) (There are packages I think could and should be made prerequisites, which would avoid some trouble.)

Yes, but in general work-arounds made in Sage should be obsoleted by later upstream releases. (This is of course not always the case, and as seen above, some changes aren't upstream problems.)

> [...] I've no idea if that is necessary on anything other than AIX 5.3.


The snippet from GSL's `INSTALL` suggests it's not an AIX problem, but rather one of GCC.

All the more reason for this to be handled by autoconf. Since AIX is the only platform where this problem has been observed, it might be sensible to just make an AIX specific patch. 

I guess the GSL developers are quite within their rights to refuse to work around compiler bugs. I know the MPFR developers will not work around compiler bugs. 

I really wish I had a copy of the C standard, so knew exactly what should be defined and where.

Yes, I think that is correct. If one uses grep one can see `fprnd_t` is defined in IBM's `/usr/include/float.h` but it is defined in the headers created by gcc. 

I posted this problem to the gcc-help mailing list

http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2010-10/msg00327.html

I was asked by  Ian Lance Taylor (who I suspect is one of the GCC developers) to post this as a bug on the gcc bug database. So I have now done that. 

This is now the following GCC bug:

I meant to say `fprnd_t` is defined in IBM's `/usr/include/float.h` but is **not** defined in any of the three `float.h` header files created by gcc.

+
+ == Solution ==
+Simply use the new .spkg at 
+
+http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/gsl-1.14.p0.spkg
+
+There is no need for any library patches. That .spkg has all the changes needed. Patches attached here are for review purposes only - they do not need to be applied.

```

The changes, which are only applied on AIX, consist of:

* A revised configure.ac which checks for fprnd_t

See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=348558 and http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46072 for information about this GCC bug, which is affecting many pieces of software - not just GSL. 

**Note** All changes to spkg-install are inside sections which have

```
If [ "x$UNAME~" = xAIX ] ; then
   # some changes
fi
```

so although these changes would not cause problems on any platform, for extra security they are only applied on AIX. 

This now needs review. Sorry for the size of the Mercurial patch, but this is because there's a new configure script that's auto-generated. That is quite large.
