If you build Sage in a path containing "numpy", then `get_systems` in citation.pyx will think that numpy is used in every command, because it does a regular expression search for "numpy" using full pathnames.  The attached patch replaces SAGE_ROOT with an empty string, to avoid such false positives.

To test, move an existing Sage installation to /tmp/numpy/sage-4.6.alpha3/, doctest citation.pyx, apply the patch and doctest again.  (Other strings which will trigger a failure: scipy, _libsingular, _flint; see the full list at the top of misc/citation.pyx.)
