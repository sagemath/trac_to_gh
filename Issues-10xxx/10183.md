In several places, long doctests are incorrectly tagged "# long" instead of "# long time", thus mistakenly preventing them from being omitted when "-long" is not included on the command line.

The patch here looks good, similar to trac #10182. I tested the timings before and after, log files are attached (didn't know if this is appropriate here or not, but figured I'd include them anyway). There was an error testing schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py with "sage -t" which doesn't occur with "sage -t --long" that I'm puzzled about. Here is the error:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py"
  ***   Warning: new stack size = 1003360 (0.957 Mbytes).

    sage: E.simon_two_descent ()

    (1, 1, [])
Got:
    (3, 3, [(1 : 0 : 1), (0 : 2 : 1), (2 : -1 : 1)])

***Test Failed*** 1 failures.

	 [39.4 s]
```

The test in question is:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, -1, 0, -751055859, -7922219731979])     # long time (0.6 seconds)
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: E.simon_two_descent ()
```

When I run these commands in an interactive sage session I get the "expected" answer:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, -1, 0, -751055859, -7922219731979])     # long time (0.6 seconds)
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: E.simon_two_descent ()
(1, 1, [])
```

but when the test gets done as part of "sage -t" the result is different (see above). When the test is done with "sage -t --long" there is no deviation from the expected answer. 

Looks to me like what's going on is that with "sage -t" the line tagged "# long time" is not executed, so the calculation 

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: E.simon_two_descent ()
```

applies to the previously defined Elliptic curve (on line 1435) where the following test is performed:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('5077a1')
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(3, 3, [(1 : 0 : 1), (0 : 2 : 1), (2 : -1 : 1)])
```
The output here is what sage is complaining is not equal to the expected output in the present test.

So... I guess the whole three line block lines 1445 - 1447 should be tagged "# long time".

Other than this problem, the patch produces expected timing differences.

Benjamin,  Your analysis is entirely correct!

I don't have time right now to re-review the patch, but I'm sure it is fine now.

Damek,  you should try to work out how you did not detect this problem (which was certainly not your fault).  It's important to do full testing before asking for a review!
