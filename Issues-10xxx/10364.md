Patch creates a `zero_vector` constructor, mirroring the `zero_matrix` constructor.  It adds error-checking to the `vector` constructor for the case of a negative degree.  

Finally, it adds a new, more informative error message when a dictionary is used for the entries of a (sparse) vector and a degree is given.  Presently, the following syntax executes without an error, though the result would not be what we should expect.  This "works" since the dictionary has "length" 3.

```
sage: vector(QQ, 3, {0:0, 2:5, 12:-1})
(0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1)
```

This could be improved further by adjusting the `prepare_dict` method to accept an optional integer degree for the number of entries.  Then instead of an error we could have the (fictional) behavior:

```
sage: vector(QQ, 6, {1:2, 4:-3})
(0, 2, 0, 0, -3, 0)
```

This depends on #10362 since one doctest there has changed in this patch.

I don't quite like error-checking in `zero_vector` because I think that it belongs to the general vector constructor. I think code like

```
def zero_vector(arg0, arg1=None):
    if arg1 is None:
        arg0, arg1 = ZZ, arg0
    return vector(arg0, arg1)
```
would be better for uniform input handling. (Maybe it would even make sense to get zero integer vector from `vector(5)`, but that's a bigger change.)

I guess also that the list in CALL FORMAT has the issue with INPUT right under it as on #10362.

I agree that using the error-checking code from the more general `vector` constructor would be best.  But the `vector()` constructor is so permissive and accepts such a variety of input, that I think any input to a new `zero_vector` *must* get scrutinized (and then report the problem).  Here's the example and test:

```
def mock_zero_vector(arg0, arg1=None):
    if arg1 is None:
        arg0, arg1 = sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing(), arg0
    return vector(arg0, arg1)
```

```
sage: v = sage.modules.free_module_element.mock_zero_vector([1,2,3])
sage: v
(1, 2, 3)
```

At least one check is being made in the general constructor - seeing if the proposed degree is negative.

> I guess also that the list in CALL FORMAT has the issue with INPUT right under it as on #10362.

Yes, I'll get to this with any other changes.  Thanks.

Sounds good.  Thanks.

Standalone v2 patch just fixes up the documentation - call formats and output block only.  Thanks for your help with these.
