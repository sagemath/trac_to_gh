I had the following failures to apply, 4.6.1.rc1 on OS X.
This doesn't have 5945 as a prerequisite, does it?

Hi Sebastian, 

Hope you're well. Trivial comment: it's the done thing to put full names, not trac usernames, in the Author and Reviewer fields because they're used for compiling the release notes.

Less trivial: can you perhaps do a micro-patch that gets rid of the unused variable in ndigits? The rest of the code looks fine to me, and it would be good to get this positively reviewed soon, because any patch that changes quite so many lines of code is going to be highly vulnerable to bitrotting (it already conflicts with my patch at #10625, sigh).
