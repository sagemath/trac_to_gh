Generic code clean-up such as line breaks, empty lines, use of GMP functions etc


Before:

```
sage: x = factorial(2**14)
sage: timeit('y = odd_part(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 10.6 µs per loop
```

```
sage: odd_part(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: unsupported operands for >>: 0, +Infinity
```
After:

```
sage: x = factorial(2**14)
sage: timeit('y = x.odd_part()')
625 loops, best of 3: 4.52 µs per loop
```

```
sage: ZZ(0).odd_part()
0
```
