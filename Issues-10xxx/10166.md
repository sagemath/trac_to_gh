A little searching on the sage mailing lists found that Pablo De Napoli is pdenapo.  I have added the name as both Author and to [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames).

Pablo - If you want to add your affiliation, you will need to do that yourself.
