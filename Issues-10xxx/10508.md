```
The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in the ATLAS spkg.

* Updated to newest upstream source, various patches are no longer required
* `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path` now searches in `path/libatlas.so` instead of `path/lib/libatlas.so` so it works for people with atlas in `/lib64`, too.
* Threading is now enabled by default
* Flush before `os.system` (#13210)

Upstream has made some attempt at changing the layout of the shared libraries, which is now different from the static libraries. The atlas spkg contains a stub autoconf/libtools project that unpacks the static libraries and repacks them into equivalent shared libraries.

By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.

There is an [upstream problem](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3570164&group_id=23725&atid=379483) where compilation sometimes crashes during `xextract` because of a buffer overflow due to small fixed-sized buffers for filenames.

Updated **spkg**:
1. [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg).

**Apply**
1. [attachment:10508_root.patch] to the SAGE_ROOT repository 
2. [attachment:trac_10508_doctest.rebased.patch] and [attachment:trac_10508_update_atlas_docs.rebased.patch] to the Sage repository.
3. [attachment:10508_scripts.patch] to `local/bin`.

**Remove** the lapack and blas packages.

The cvxopt spkg needs to be updated to link correctly with this atlas release, see #10509.

This fails because `ATL_NCPU` is not set. Do you have a single-core processor? I guess the threaded libraries are not built in that case.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I changed the `spkg-install` to make only single-threaded shared libraries if necessary. Should work now. 

For simplicity, I made spkgs for cvxopts and sage_scripts. So you need to add

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.9.32.spkg
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/cvxopt-1.1.3.p0.spkg
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/sage_scripts-4.6.1.alpha3.p0.spkg

to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` and then
* replace `spkg/install` with the attached version (Note that `sage_scripts` overwrites this file during installation, aargh)
* replace `spkg/standard/deps` with the attached version.

I'm still having doctest errors with linbox...

It builds OK, but then testlong gives quite a bit of failures:

<a id='comment:12'></a>A lot of it is probably related. Was this a build from scratch?
linbox calls seem to be particularly affected, there are a lot of failures in that
path:
sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense._charpoly_linbox
stuff going through:
sage.matrix.matrix_rational_dense.Matrix_rational_dense.right_kernel
is also affected and that smells like atlas at work too.

I must say we have observed a number of failures related to ATLAS-3.9.23 in 
sage-on-gentoo:
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/3)
you have failure there too but not due to iml/ATLAS as far as I can see.
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/6](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues#issue/6)
more subtle.
I see you have the failure with devel/sage/sage/finance/time_series.pyx
you may want to look the comment I wrote about it in the section 
"known test failures for Sage on Gentoo":
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/wiki/Known-test-failures](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/wiki/Known-test-failures)
note that sage-on-gentoo can use (c)blas-reference, ATLAS or gsl-cblas or some combinations - in fact amd and intel libraries could in principle be used but
no one I know has tried.
[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/blas-lapack.xml](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/blas-lapack.xml)

Not sure about the SIGFPE, it could come from a result rounded to 0 or the like.

yes, it's a build from scratch, on the same machine (old Pentium M) as already discussed above.

I wonder if these are Atlas bugs, or Linbox bugs...

One should try an OSX build.

I had forgotten about that. I checked the spkg and ATLAS is not built on
cygwin and OS X. So it makes sense.

I notice you say it is a Pentium M, yet ATLAS is compiling things 
with the assumption that it is a coreduo:
-DATL_ARCH_CoreDuo -DATL_CPUMHZ=800 -DATL_SSE3 -DATL_SSE2 -DATL_SSE1 -DATL_GAS_x8632
I am guessing the speed is right but the rest is not. Was your successful build
using these parameters? I had in one instance a non-working ATLAS because the
cpu type was misdetected (wanted to use sse3 when it didn't have them). The build
was curiously successful but the library was unusable.

The processor is Pentium M
Banias 1.1GHz, http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=27600
(according to GotoBlas installation procedure :-))

The Atlas built is not totally useless, it works for many doctests.
By the way, 3.8 also thinks it's a CoreDuo. And it works. I saw somewhere a note that it's OK.

Converting a NAN into a GMP integer is exactly what was happening in [https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/3](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/3) and it didn't happen when using gslcblas. I will do a full build of sage-on-gentoo with 3.9.40 (or 41) and see if I can see anything.

I think (IMHO but I might be wrong) that assertions should be used only in a situation where an assertion being false indicates a bug in the program.  If `rc != 0` in `spkg-install`, that is an ordinary error condition, not a bug in the `spkg-install` script.

I can beat that:

```
Finished installing shared ATLAS library.

real	821m14.881s
user	739m58.560s
sys	58m23.440s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.0
```

(That's with `sage -f ...` on an otherwise idle machine, an AMD Fusion E-450 running Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64.)

It took far more time than building *all of Sage* [in parallel, on that dual-core CPU], including the old ATLAS spkg.  I currently have no figures for a *separate* ATLAS 3.8.4 build, but the timings from previous parallel Sage builds on that machine vary between

```
real	214m52.096s
user	175m5.390s
sys	9m56.210s
Successfully installed atlas-3.8.4.p1
```

and

```
real	256m32.949s
user	217m30.760s
sys	10m31.050s
Successfully installed atlas-3.8.4.p1
```

(The LAPACK and BLAS spkg build times in these builds are a few minutes and less than one minute [wall time], respectively.)

I was actually hoping ATLAS 3.9.x / 3.10 meanwhile "knows" these AMD CPUs and therefore builds at least a bit *faster*...

How about also installing a user script for convenience to save the built ATLAS libraries to another place (for later use with `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB`)?

Regarding the mentioned excessive tuning times, I also wonder whether we should use something like `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` (or `base`) *by default*, i.e., only do self-tuning if the user explicitly asks for it in some way.

I noticed that libcblas.so is using rpath

```
ldd -r local/lib/libcblas.so.2.1.0 
        linux-vdso64.so.1 =>  (0x0000040000000000)
        libatlas.so.2 => /hpc/scratch/frb15/sandbox/sage-5.1.beta5/local/lib/libatlas.so.2 (0x0000040000060000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/power7/libpthread.so.0 (0x00000400008a0000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib64/power7/libm.so.6 (0x00000400008e0000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/power7/libc.so.6 (0x00000400009c0000)
        /lib64/ld64.so.1 (0x0000000024560000)
```
And that's from outside the sage shell. However for f77blas and presumably lapack, libgfortran is not rpath-ed (I am using sage gcc's spkg in this case). 

That is important info if you want to put atlas libraries in another location.

I will run a few tests shortly.

Using `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` in contrast worked (and `ptestlong` passed with Sage 5.2.rc0, FWIW):

Sure.  Although ATLAS currently consumes only <= 9W ;-)

Unfortunately ATLAS is built quite late (due to its odd dependency on **Sage's** Python -- while your script is apparently designed to support Python 2.4 as well), so a fair amount of the time spent building Sage only one core is used (because the remaining packages directly or indirectly depend on ATLAS).


I reinstalled the updated spkg again with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`:

ROFL, with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH="AMD64K10h,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1,3DNow"` (which involves self-tuning) it took

```
real	36m15.153s
user	31m23.290s
sys	5m56.960s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.0
```

Also a bit strange is that the timing for `ptestlong` (all for Sage 5.2.rc0, GCC 4.4.3) was

  `base` < `fast` < `AMD64K10h`

(i.e., fastest with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`), although I think at least during the last run the machine was partially loaded with other stuff as well, and clearly `ptestlong` isn't very appropriate to benchmark ATLAS performance... ;-)

Perhaps this ticket should get #13160 as a dependence. One thing I checked is that it appears to work on OSX 10.6.8, both with native blas/lapack, and with Atlas 3.10 from this ticket. I imagine #13160 can get finalized quickly.

FWIW, while `make time` works, `make atlvat2.pdf ...` (to build ATLAS vs. ATLAS comparison charts) seems to be broken -- for me it always fails with a buffer overflow.

+The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in the ATLAS spkg.
 
+* Updated to newest upstream source, various patches are no longer required

+Upstream has made some attempt at changing the layout of the shared libraries, which is now different from the static libraries. The atlas spkg contains a stub autoconf/libtools project that unpacks the static libraries and repacks them into equivalent shared libraries.
+
+By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.

Ouch.  How long did 3.8.4 take to build, and did you suspend the ECM background jobs? (They're back again...)

You mean the (reproducible) segfaults on some AVX CPUs?  These can be solved by reinstalling the ATLAS spkg (one or two times) -- which doesn't take that long, as these CPUs are fast... ;-)

No, seriously, as a temporary "solution", we could at least put the old ATLAS, BLAS and LAPACK spkgs into the experimental branch, such that (e.g.) Itanium users can still access them (to be installed manually with `./sage -f ...` of course).




W.r.t. the "dead archictecture":  It's IMHO always good to test on a broad range of platforms, as that might expose real bugs that just incidentally don't show up on the "mainstream" (Intel, AMD, meanwhile perhaps also ARM); if one day GCC does no longer support Itanium, the situation will be different.

When compiling the new ATLAS spkg, I suspended two of the background processes (that is, I did `touch /tmp/iras1` and `touch /tmp/iras2`). When compiling the previous version, I didn't bother to do this.

I don't feel too strongly about it either way, but I would be a little surprised if Jeroen is willing to merge this if it takes so long to build on iras.

I guess in your earlier test ATLAS failed to use the `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast` build because of system load (first attempt), then tried `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base` which is the old Itanium (not Itanium 2), which then did a full search for timings. Something like that must have happened, the compile is not just 30x faster without background jobs running. 

So I guess all problems are solved?

One way or another, single-core machines do not need many features of the new Atlas. Perhaps it's time to think about versioning possibilities: a meta-package Atlas that installs an appropriate for the architecture version?

Also, I don't think there is an easy way to know that atlas would take a long time without actually building it. We could just install a reference blas on all non-starte-of-the-art machines (say, less than 4 cores and 2GHz). But this will be a major rewrite of how Sage builds its BLAS libraries.

It doesn't quite settle it, because the new spkg simply **fails to build** on some machines.

That would be a start but most of the spkg using blas have specific rules for OS X and we would need to change them before they start using ATLAS instead of veclib. From the top of my head:
* iml (actually that would solve some problems)
* linbox
* numpy
* scipy
* cvxopt
* R?

I believe sage itself can cope with the change as is but it should be checked.

I've touched cvxopt and am trying to build the rest of Sage now, so don't hold your breath yet that this was a permanent fix (in addition to roughly doubling the build time of Sage, not that this would matter on this platform).

<a id='comment:0'></a>Hi,

now that I re-read the comments here again, I seem to faintly remember this problem circle from my adventure with lmonade (Gentoo Prefix derivative) on OS X 10.4 last year. See my travel account about this, points "22." and "26." and especially the rant following that in:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lmnd-devel/1ZqHx1JBY2Q/syAOZYtZN4IJ

1. If my memory is correct, the symbol "_ATL_DecAtomicCount" comes from/is resolved in libblas(.dylib), this could be checked independently from the underlying OS. Where is libblas.dylib (libblas.so under Linux) located, is it something like .../lib/blas/reference/?

2. Karl-Dieter, I try to catch up with what you installed and tried, but till then could you please try

"sage -R"

anyway in the meantime (from the shell prompt) and print the result, probably an error message from the OS X 10.4 less-than-optimal dyld dynamic loader?

3. If this really is what the problem is about, some symlinks might suffice, but I do not remember exactly how and for which libraries (both R and maxima were affected in a weird way, and Volker's compilerwrapper intervenes in the lmonade setting, too). 

Best regards,

Georg


P.S.:
Later last year, I ultimately managed somehow to get some 64-bit Sage (lmonade flavour) working on the 32-bit OS X 10.4, so in the course, I definitely had to successfully build and link/reference some new "self-made" 64-bit atlas/blas, since OS X 10.4 only ships with a 32-bit "system copy" of atlas/blas, so this is definitely doable. But even Python itself is not officially supported as 64-bit version on OS X 10.4, so quite some more hackery was needed. (This only might be interesting, if one day the Sage project wants to get rid of the dependency of certain Apple system library headers, which come only with "XCode", or more precisely the "command line tools", on newer OS X versions --- currently these are a prerequisite for building Sage on OS X.)

The fix is trivial (once one knows what the problem is), in module_list.py there is a "-lpari" option missing for the cremona.mat module (for the other cremona.xxx modules, the "-lpari" option is listed with a comment about "Cygiwn might need this" --- obviously the dynamic linker/loader on OS X 10.4 MacIntel is comparably dumb).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi all,
it is really puzzling, why with current Sage-5.3 on OS X 10.4 PPC (yesterday released, it's up on the servers), the cvxopt-1.1.5 spkg finds during its build the blas.dylib --- but with the changes of this ticket here, cvxopt-1.1.5 does not find it anymore (see comments #142 and #170 here).

Some facts:

- On OS X 10.4 PPC, under the directory "/usr/lib/", there are no "atlas.dylib", "blas.dylib", "cblas.dylib", "lapack.dylib" files or links (on OS X 10.4 Intel, these four entries *do* exist there, as links).
- On OS X 10.4 (both PPC and Intel), Sage historically does not build atlas nor blas (nor cblas) nor lapack, so there are not corresponding dylibs either under "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/".
- In $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/module_list.py, there is some magic for the configuration of the "BLAS" and "BLAS2" macros. Given the above fact(s), on OS X 10.4 PPC, I read these as resulting to use "gslblas" (!!) provided by Sage, on OS X 10.4 Intel, I read these as resulting to use the system "cblas" and "atlas".
- On OS X 10.4 Intel, these "system" atlas, blas, and cblas libraries actually all link to one and the same "blas.dylib" located under /System/Libraries/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/version/A/vecLIB.framwork/version/A/ (or some permutation thereof, I can't look up the exact path right now at the moment). These libraries are also located there under OS X 10.4 PPC, but there do not seem to be any links.
- The old cvxopt-1.1.4(.p1) lists "gslblas" as library to be linked to, but actually, it is unclear at least to me, which kind of "blas" library really got used in the end on OS X 10.4 --- maybe on PPC some different one than on Intel.

Is it possible that currently, the build of cvxopt-1.1.5 on OS X 10.4 PPC succeeds only during a "whole" build of Sagte-5.3, the linker somehow caching the libraries it finds in the course of the build (especially "blas.dylib" somewhen before cvxopt is built) --- and with the changes of this ticket, the build sequence changes somehow so suddenly, "blas.dylib" is not anymore in this cache (or whatever kind of mechansim with the same result)?

hmm, no, I think on OSX there is native blas/lapack (veclib) which was used (and still is used, given the right settings used to build Sage).

as far as CVXOPT is concerned, it does use MacOSX veclib (there was a OSX 10.7-related ticket which dealt with the fact that veclib changed some undefined behaviour when 10.7 was released, and CVXOPT got hit by this issue).

Sage 5.3 works on it, of course - in fact, I just used the app bundle yesterday - but it would take some time to start a fresh 5.3 or 5.4.beta0.\n\n\nIt is not necessary to \"start a fresh 5.3 or 5.4.beta0\". Instead, one can go to some Sage OS X PPC download page, http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/sagemath/sage-mirror/osx/powerpc/index.html , download from there e.g. \"sage-5.3-OSX-32bit-10.4-PowerMacintosh-Darwin.dmg\", and look inside --- on any OS X system/version. The result is ... surprising, to say the least:\n\n```\nsagebuilder$ otool -L lapack.so\nlapack.so:\n        /Users/buildbot/build/sage/moufang-1/moufang_binary/build/sage-5.3/local/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)\n        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)\n        /Users/buildbot/build/sage/moufang-1/moufang_binary/build/sage-5.3/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)\n        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.12)\n```\nThe two occurences of \"libgcc_s.1.dylib\" are somewhat fishy, but apparently nothing new, and I'd vote for that topic being a complete different story, and not to be treated here any further. The library \"libSystem.B.dylib\" is the C runtime on OS X, AFAIK. But then only libfortran.dylib --- and no trace whatsoever of any *las.dylib?!?!?

It is not necessary to "start a fresh 5.3 or 5.4.beta0". Instead, one can go to some Sage OS X PPC download page, http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/sagemath/sage-mirror/osx/powerpc/index.html , download from there e.g. "sage-5.3-OSX-32bit-10.4-PowerMacintosh-Darwin.dmg", and look inside --- on any OS X system/version. The result is ... surprising, to say the least:

```
sagebuilder$ otool -L lapack.so
lapack.so:
        /Users/buildbot/build/sage/moufang-1/moufang_binary/build/sage-5.3/local/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /Users/buildbot/build/sage/moufang-1/moufang_binary/build/sage-5.3/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.12)
```
The two occurences of "libgcc_s.1.dylib" are somewhat fishy, but apparently nothing new, and I'd vote for that topic being a complete different story, and not to be treated here any further. The library "libSystem.B.dylib" is the C runtime on OS X, AFAIK. But then only libfortran.dylib --- and no trace whatsoever of any *las.dylib?!?!? For comparison, on OS X 10.4 Intel, for Sage-5.3.rc1 the analoguous result is:

```
sagebuilder$ otool -L lapack.so
lapack.so:
        /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libLAPACK.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 192.15.0)
        /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 192.15.0)
        /Users/Shared/sage/sage-5.3.rc1/local/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /Users/Shared/sage/sage-5.3.rc1/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.3.11)
```
I would conclude that it is problematic, that the OS X 10.4 PPC linker/loader builds at all the current cvxopt-1.1.5 spkg contained in Sage-5.3, producing results with such incomplete dependency information. Looking closely on the command line, it is told to use "-undefined dynamic_lookup" (which seems to save us at runtime later, however only by chance, I guess), so essentially it does what it should --- but then, why does that linker/loader under some very comparable circumstances error out with "/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lblas"???

Of the different alternatives to come to an end with this ticket here (which is about the new atlas-3.10 spkg), I like the "link idea" (see the comment 191 from Francois), i.e. the atlas spkg, generally on OS X (!), doing no more and no less than creating links in $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ --- the same as exist in /usr/lib/, at least on OS X 10.4 Intel. More precisely, three links pointing to the "framework" blas library:

```
libatlas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
libblas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
libcblas.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
```
and one more link for the "framework" lapack library (all link targets being absolute, not relative):

```
liblapack.dylib -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libLAPACK.dylib
```
A quick check shows that at least on OS X Intel, the absolute path to these framework libraries is the same for OS X 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7 (I can't check for OS X 10.8), and even on OS X 10.7.3, there still is only one version "A", which is the "Current" version of that framework.

This change, for all OS X variants, would be a bit intrusive. But to me, it seems to bring the OS X world a bit closer to the situation on the other OSes. I offer to test a respectively updated atlas spkg on the OS X systems/versions I have access to. (In the "patches" subdir, one also might wish to delete the "edit" duplicates of two files, those with a tilde at the end of their file name.)

Thoughts?

<a id='comment:0'></a>This seems to work fine.  I think that if just putting this link in the top for only PPC machines (or even only 10.4 PPC machines if Dima's tests turn out fine) would be fine.  Or even some of the other links e.g. to lapack, if appropriate.

I also feel your frustration with not having an easy machine to test with.  I would really like to make this one available, but the way I understand it that's not an option - at least, I tried the ssh method above and it didn't seem to work properly.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I ran also into the problem of comment 211, but I see that one is already cared for.

The latest "pyx_preparse()" problem might not be entirely due to what is done about "BLAS configuration/setup", and how it is done in .../sage/misc/cython.py (see especially lines 64-67 in conjunction with lines 78-79 and line 265 in that file), but certainly creates pretty exactly the kind of problem observed in comment 216, and healed by the symlink in comment 218. (It's quite a miracle to me, how that could have ever worked before under OS X 10.4 PPC --- which I know it did!)

Which leaves us with either adjusting every occurence of BLAS configuration/setup (sage/module_list.py lines 22-44, sage/misc/cython.py lines as above, cvxopt and possibly yet another spkg or two, ...) for the "OS X 10.4 PPC case" (we already *do* search for "/usr/lib/libclas.{so, dylib}" in those places, and use that one if one can be found there, just extend the search to "/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib" in case the former search failed), or else try the symlink approach. Or some "hybrid" approach, symlinking only on OS X 10.4 PPC.

`@`Volker:

In comment 209 you wrote:

> I don't think we should be symlinking system libraries into local/lib if we can avoid it.


So if you think that creating symlinks to "outside-of-sage" libraries in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/ (and possibly to header files like "cblas.h" and "clapack.h" in $SAGE_ROOT/local/include/, too) should be avoided, could you please give some insights about the reasoning behind?

P.S.:

I can't find the following note about trying to actually *build and use* ATLAS on OS X in the comments so far, so here it is: If we want to be able to do so one day, at least the numpy build system needs to be patched (somewhere in src/numpy/distutils/system_info.py, classes "lapack_opt_info" and "blas_opt_info"), since there the usage of the Accelerate framework on OS X is hardcoded --- which seems to be problematic, if other parts of Sage do not use the same underlying LAPACK and BLAS libraries. Essentially, one should be able to "just" re-use patches from the respective Gentoo ebuilds, it has the air of a "reine Fleissarbeit" (dict.leo.org: "a diligent but routine piece of work"). Of course, any OS X 10.4 PPC specific bits and pieces would then have to "behave well", too ... (the "symlinking approach" would probably make that part rather straightforward).

P.P.S.:

Now that quite a few people are involved, wouldn't it make sense to try to clean up that current BLAS configuration/setup code parts a bit? At least between module_list.py, cython.py and the cvxopt spkg install, more or less the same functionality is tripled. Possibly by moving all this to setting (or taking over from the parent environment) "SAGE_BLAS_LIB", "SAGE_CBLAS_LIB", "SAGE_ATLAS_LIB" or the like environment variables, ensuring these are sanely set at both the start of a Sage build (prereq spkg?!), as well as in the Sage environment at runtime (sage-shell?!), and then in "module_list.py", "misc/cython.py", cvxopt spkg install, ... simply referring to/using/relying on these env vars ... just letting the thoughts flow, sorry :-)

P.P.P.S.:

Unfortunately, it took me so long to write this, that it this message already mostly outdated (by comments 221, 222).

@@ -1,4 +1,23 @@
+The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in the ATLAS spkg.
 
+* Updated to newest upstream source, various patches are no longer required
+* `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path` now searches in `path/libatlas.so` instead of `path/lib/libatlas.so` so it works for people with atlas in `/lib64`, too.
+* Threading is now enabled by default
+* Flush before `os.system` (#13210)
+
+Upstream has made some attempt at changing the layout of the shared libraries, which is now different from the static libraries. The atlas spkg contains a stub autoconf/libtools project that unpacks the static libraries and repacks them into equivalent shared libraries.
+
+By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.
+
+The updated cvxopt spkg fixes a blas path issue on Darwin.

The hawk failure is reproducible, I found this in the logs:

Conjecture: this happens on all Intel i386 32-bit systems.

I'd look for an error caused by the fact that arando has a 64-bit capable CPU, but runs a 32-bit kernel.

If it's about the path lengths then it should be possible to do a standalone install of Sage on arando in /tmp, say, and see whether the new Atlas works.

I haven't been able to reproduce this on `sage.math` in 32-bit mode.

I doubt that filenames have anything to do with it.

Atlas is the only BLAS implementation around that does tuning on the fly, AFAIK. Why is this needed for the vast majority of users, it's unclear. And Atlas is mostly a 1-man project. 

I'd say that ideally Sage should accept any (sufficiently compatible) BLAS/LAPACK implementation.

What is blocking this ticket anyway? Is it only the ia64 problem? I think it a bad idea that all current/common archs are blocked because of a failure in some arch that not many people are using. I have been patching and installing these patches on my machine for 3 months now because the older atlas refuses to build successfully.

I don't really get your answer.

To make my point more clear, can't we ask the user to install "something" that would replace what the atlas spkg provides on ia64, just as on Cygwin if you prefer, rather than on OS X where it is more tricky.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Updated ATLAS and LAPACK at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg
and a properly rebased cvxopt at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p1.spkg

Maybe the following change helps on ia64:

```
   * Fixed premature KillAllMMNodes in emit_mm.c
```
Some random strings look like the bug report at http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/863/ :)

Could someone test it on the previously failing (and working) archs?

At least it builds on a Corei7 with SAGE_ATLAS_aRCH=Corei2,AVX,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1
Ill try a proper Sage build later.

I should also have access to some armv7l and ia64 on GCC Compile Farm and will try to build 5.7 + patches here there.

Could you please state from what to what as I couldn't determine that easily by just looking around on my computer?
And I can't use my computer to build different ATLAS version just for fun, so if its in the corner of you head, that would be greatly appreciated.
>Instead I'd rather change Sage to use a pkgconfig-style script to get the blas/lapack libraries. 

If that could also let other BLAS/LAPACK implementations be plugged into Sage, that would be really great.
I remember some discussion on sage-devel recently, but the proposed solution looked quite more complicated, don't remmeber why.

I got their potential use, but are they actually used by the spkg scripts?
That's what I did not get.
I could not find any doc either about them.

Ok, I took the time to actually rebuild ATLAS 3.10.1 and do as advertised at:
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/node22.html
and there is indeed just one serial/parallel shared library built now called libatlas.so/libtatlas.so which contains all of libcblas.a libf77blas.a libatlas.a liblapack.a (or pt version of them).
Its also possible to rule out the fortran symbols.

I don't know what ATLAS 3.8.4 offered if it did offer anything for shared libraries.

Anyway, Im happy with your autotools script which basically do the same thing as upstream but in separate libraries.

Got it, the fix used defines something if using GCC 4.4.5 on non x86_64 because its needed on 32 bits.
Unfortunately this breaks ia64 (maybe other 64 bits systems? anybody wants to try out GCC 4.4.5 on sparc64 or ppc64 :)), so the problem it the filtering on "non x86_64", rather than "32 bits".

That's where the ia64 comes from.
Both "uname -p" and "uname -i" spit "unknown".

Most failures from gap seem to be of type

```
gap(22997): unaligned access to 0x60000fffffffa46f, ip=0x40000000001a7ba0
```
The one from gfan with assertions failures surely due to similar reasons.
It reminds me of #13151.

Some other failures involve permutation and symmetric stuff.

In particular I got no segfault in sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx.

After copying the tar.bz2 archdefs files in the patches directory into the src/CONFIG/ARCHS I indeed get a much faster (something between 40 minutes and 1 hour) build, so I guess you put them there in that intention and we should trigger the copy in spkg-install.

I'll put an updated spkg with that and a fix for detection of ia64 online soon.

Did it segfault as before during "make ptest"?
I guess it was one of the main reason to withhold this package, so it would be great to know.
At least on the setup I used, there was no problem.

I get similar problems on sparc hardware.
There must be something wrong in the build system because some asm routines are not available for sparc and it does not fallback to generic routines but rather leaves undefined symbol for DecAtomicCount (and two other related functions).

By the way these functions seem thread related but passing again -t 0 to configure as used to be the case in our previous spkg does not solve the problem, the thread part still gets built, even if it may be not used.

From what I've seen on a Debian ppc64, by default the correct mut implementation of DecAtomicCount and the two other functions get picked up (note there is a ppc assembly implem but its commented as unstable and an #error statement is put in the assembly file).

But if I put back the "-t 0" param when configuring ATLAS, then these three functions do not get defined, which would be ok if other thread related functions which point to these functions were not defined...
So if I explicitely disable thread, ATLAS still builds some (but not all!) of the thread related functions and if I tried to dlopen the library the runtime linker fails with undefined symbols as reported by Karl Dieter.

Nonetheless I don't think that the problem I just stated is what Karl Dieter encountered as he used the default configuration and so should get the fallback implementaiton of DecAtomicCount and related.
I also encountered such a behavior on sparc where there is no assembly routines and somehow the fallback implementation is not picked as well.

Karl Dieter, could you post your ATLAS build log somewhere please?

Well, this **might** be due to how *Sage* builds shared libraries from ATLAS' *static* ones, as statically linking by default does some kind of dead code elimination ("removing" unused modules and hence potentially dead references).

Same problem (at least there is an undefined ATL_DecAtomicCount and defined ATL_GetAtomicCount in the generated libsatlas.so) with the shared libs generated using ATLAS build system rather than Volker's autotools based one.

I'm giving it a shot on Linux just to see what happens if I try to disable threads there as well.

Hum, you got me.
What's that and how to check it?

From what I just reported it seems the undefined symbols are no problem with a non threaded build (also I guess it would be cleaner not to include all these defined thread related functions).

The problem might arise when one actually try to build a threaded lib but ATLAS fails to pick assembly or fallback code for ATL_DecAtomicCount.
I'm currently trying to build R (it never went that far, don't remember why) on a sparc system which failed to build a real threaded lib just like Karl Dieter ppc system.
It's quite slow but I should be able to report today.

On ELF systems, e.g. with `readelf -d foo.so` [ `| grep -w NEEDED` ]. :-)

These are the entries where shared libraries needed by the program / the shared library itself are recorded.

Presumably... ;-)




> The problem might arise when one actually try to build a threaded lib but ATLAS fails to pick assembly or fallback code for ATL_DecAtomicCount.


If it fails in that case (too), that's an ATLAS bug I'd say.  (Unless it would use some to-be-linked-in external functions instead, but the `ATL_` prefix indicates it doesn't [try to].)




> I'm currently trying to build R (it never went that far, don't remember why) on a sparc system which failed to build a real threaded lib just like Karl Dieter ppc system.


R is often built quite "late", not just because of its dependencies, but perhaps also due to our `deps`, i.e., the order [otherwise independent] packages are listed there  (*I think<sup>TM</sup>*).

On a fast multi-core system, R will usually be the last package to finish building. But that's more because R depends on ATLAS (so it has to be built "late") and it's built mainly single-threaded.

Ok, so I'll assume the ATLAS spkg is ok for the R one now.

These are present when building the old spkg (3.8.4.p1) as well as the just posted 3.10.1.p0. Are they important?

Indeed, local/lib has liblapack.a and libblas.a when I don't use this ticket, but not with this ticket (though both have libblas.dll.a).

And I guess this is unsurprising, because we don't really do anything on Cygwin!

```
Copying /usr/lib/libblas.dll.a to /home/sagetest/sage-5.9.beta0/local/lib
```
is the extent of the log for atlas in both cases, whereas before lapack was definitely built (lots of `sage_fortran` etc. in the log) and of course now it's MIA by design.

So... do we have to now *build* atlas on Cygwin?  I can do

```
cp /usr/lib/liblapack.a /home/sagetest/sage-5.9.beta0/local/lib
```
for now, hopefully that will work...

This ticket still has

```
# On Cygwin we simply require that the system-wide lapack is installed.
# This includes BLAS and is enough to build the rest of Sage.
if conf['CYGWIN?']:
    lib = '/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a'
    if not os.path.exists(lib):
        print '*'*75
        print 'On Cygwin you must install the standard LAPACK Cygwin package'
        print 'via the Cygwin setup.exe program in the "Math" category.'
        print '*'*75 
        sys.exit(1)
    cp(lib, os.path.join(conf['SAGE_LOCAL'], 'lib'))
    sys.exit(0)
```
but I think that now we'll have to add to it to copy liblapack.a (or build lapack, of course).  

So I think that probably some update to this needs to be included.  Maybe this would still be enough?

Did you use the p1 spkg I posted and linked toward the end of the comments?

Not really. ATLAS does some kind of "brute force" CPU detection where it tries to compile with various options for various kinds of CPUs until one succeeds.

Well, anyway that needs to be fixed so that Cygwin knows where to find what.

No, it was in comment:299 - that's scores of comments ago.  If that is really what is needed, then you should update the ticket description (which I have now done).

Does that mean I shouldn't have used Volker's spkg for atlas either?  Does yours behave properly w.r.t. Cygwin?

It doesn't, at least not automatically - it just copies libblas.dll.a but not liblapack.a, and then exits.

And for Scipy's spkg-install, that's a problem when it's not in `$SAGE_LOCAL`:

```

if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    unset ATLAS
    unset BLAS
    unset LAPACK
    export LDFLAGS="-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup $LDFLAGS"
else
    export ATLAS="$SAGE_LOCAL"  
    export BLAS="$SAGE_LOCAL"
    export LAPACK="$SAGE_LOCAL"
    export LDFLAGS="-shared $LDFLAGS"
fi
```
I think it doesn't really make sense to change Scipy's spkg.  I think it *does* make sense to copy liblapack in the same way and some messages about exactly what lapack stuff to install on Cygwin here, and then someone can use `SAGE_ATLAS_INSTALL=???` to try out atlas building on Cygwin.  Since there is a lot of other stuff going on here, I'm not going to attempt to confuse the issue by uploading my own spkg now, but JP knows what's needed and can surely<sup>TM</sup> take care of it :-)

<a id='comment:0'></a>My 3.10.1.p0 spkg is the most up to date.
You can also give the 3.11.8.p0 spkg a shot but it should not work because of the ATL_samm issue.
As this is not really working yet, I was too lazy to update the ticket descritpion.

And I did not take care of Cygwin yet; just for info the needed packge are lapack (or liblapack0) and liblapack-devel.

I first tried a little bit of ia64 and then Debian/Solaris sparc and things are quite horrible already.
There is this boring fallback threads code which is not correctly picked when configured to use threads and no assembly is available, and unfortunately the build system seems a little broken and the same broken pieces get picked up when configured not to use threads as well.
In fact I think getting it to properly install on Cygwin will be easier.

And finally there is the case of your PPC OS X 14 which seems to have similar problems as what I got on ia64/sparc.

I had the same problem on my Solaris, it just seems that Solaris test does not like the -e flag:

```
if [ -e /infres/post/flori/sage-5.7-infres2/spkg/build/atlas-3.10.1.p0/ATLAS-bui

<a id='comment:4'></a>And this is somehow in http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html .

So we should:
* sed -e for -f on Solaris.

So I think we have more or less two problems left for ATLAS 3.10.1:
* investigate problems with threads related functions:
  * fallback code not used when assembly is not available on some systems (i.e. my Debian sparc, but not the Solaris sparc...), a first try seems that going to the build dir and retrying to build the thread related functions solves the problem as suggested here: http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/170/#6a80
  * threads functions are still included even though "-t 0" is passed, so the above problem cannot be fixed by disabling threads, it seems this is known upstream and is problematic because we use shared libraries, static should be ok, see http://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/855/
* segfaults on ia64, that will be a lot of fun :) 

And later:
* fix Cygwin stuff
* solve ATL_samm for ATLAS 3.11.8

<a id='comment:8'></a>I set

```
SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei2,AVX,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1
```
which was sensible for my harware, nothing different from Linux.
Anything not empty will trigger the build, so just choose what fits your hardware;
I guess "base" and "fast" should do if you have no idea.

And then I issued make (MAKE="make -j4").

It failed in the end because of libttool

```
blabla libtool cannot link non-libtool object blabla on this host blabla
```

So in a Sage shell just cd to the ($SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/atlas-3.10.1.p0/)ATLAS-lib dir, open Makefile.am and just do what is done for the different lib*.la target but more or less replace `@`LIBTOOL`@` by gcc (or gfortran if there is as well --tag=F77) for the compilation line (and don't forget lib deps -l...).
For instance to build a minimally fancy libatlas.dll:

```
mkdir libatlas-objs
cd libatlas-objs
ar x ../libatlas.a
cd ..
gcc -shared -o libatlas.dll libatlas-objs/*.o
cp libatlas.dll $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/
```
and for a fortran one for instance

```
mkdir liblapack-objs
cd liblapack-objs
ar x ../liblapack.a
cd ..
gfortran -shared -o liblapack.dll liblapack-objs/*.o -latlas -lcblas -lf77blas -lm
cp liblapack.dll $SAGE_LOCAL/lib
```
We could add fancy versioning and creating an import lib and so on, but let's try that first.

Did it actually build ATLAS or did it use the framework thing Apple provides?
I thought that was the solution actually used.
If that's the case (look at the log), could you also try actually buliding ATLAS, by setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH to something non empty I guess,

Of course, and I pointed out that code.  We've always done this.

I guess I could try this... seems overkill.

+The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in the ATLAS spkg.
 
+* Updated to newest upstream source, various patches are no longer required
+* `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path` now searches in `path/libatlas.so` instead of `path/lib/libatlas.so` so it works for people with atlas in `/lib64`, too.

+
+Upstream has made some attempt at changing the layout of the shared libraries, which is now different from the static libraries. The atlas spkg contains a stub autoconf/libtools project that unpacks the static libraries and repacks them into equivalent shared libraries.
+
+By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.
+
+The updated cvxopt spkg fixes a blas path issue on Darwin, and is rebased to the most recent cvxopt package to include a Cygwin fix.
+
+There is an [upstream problem](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3570164&group_id=23725&atid=379483) where compilation sometimes crashes during `xextract` because of a buffer overflow due to small fixed-sized buffers for filenames.

Could you try running "nm libatlas.dylib|grep "DecAtomic"" on the produced shared libraries (assuming its called libatlas.dylib on OS X)?

I'll also try to build ATLAS on a more recent OS X running on Intel next week to see what happens.

If you produced a patch for the autotools build system Volker crafted, it would be very welcome, otherwise, I'll take care of it.
In fact, i don't think libtool should be used, but whatever.

I just meant that we put a check in `spkg-install` for Cygwin and then copy the appropriate libraries to $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/.  See comment:362.  I don't have time to do that right now, though.

Well, Cygwin isn't supported yet, so I don't think it needs to be here for things to be positive review.

+* Flush before `os.system` (#13210)
+
+Upstream has made some attempt at changing the layout of the shared libraries, which is now different from the static libraries. The atlas spkg contains a stub autoconf/libtools project that unpacks the static libraries and repacks them into equivalent shared libraries.
+
+By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.
+
+The updated cvxopt spkg fixes a blas path issue on Darwin, and is rebased to the most recent cvxopt package to include a Cygwin fix.
+
+There is an [upstream problem](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3570164&group_id=23725&atid=379483) where compilation sometimes crashes during `xextract` because of a buffer overflow due to small fixed-sized buffers for filenames.
+
+Updated **spkg**s:
+1. old [http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.10.0.p1.spkg](http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/atlas-3.10.0.p1.spkg), or rather updated [ http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg] with additional fixes to our spkg scripts and patches.
+   * Optionally, the next upstream [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.11.8.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.11.8.p0.spkg) which seems completely broken at least as far as shared libraries are concerned.
+2. [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/cvxopt-1.1.5.p1.spkg)
+
+**Apply** [attachment:10508_root_after_13415.patch] to the SAGE_ROOT repository and [attachment:trac_10508_doctest.rebased.patch], [attachment:trac_10508_update_atlas_docs.patch] to the Sage repository.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I've updated:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/atlas-3.10.1.p0.spkg
to include:
* the Solaris fix,
* copy correct libs on Cygwin,
* hopefully better messages about setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH for Cygwin and Darwin.

About Cywgin libs, I don't copy the static LAPACK archive but rather the import library "/usr/lib/liblapack.dll.a" (just as we did fo the BLAS one "/usr/lib/libblas.dll.a").
This should work ok and let link to the shared LAPACK library which in my opinion (and Volker's apparently) is better.
Note I've not actually tested this.

I did not:
* test on problematic ia64 systems, the ones I have access to (gcc60 and gcc66) seem fine, waiting for report of people having access to skynet, that may be considered a blocker although ia64 is not that common anymore and not all ia64 systems seem affected...
* craft or include a fixed shared library build system for Cygwin yet, but that should be postponed for a later ticket,
* fix the problems with fallback code/thread related functions which prevent building on exotic systems such as linux/sparc or (old?) darwin/ppc, but we don't support them anyway.

Note that every problem we encountered here has been reported upstream.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I'm trying to build the spkg again on Solaris and I cannot get it to work with the Sun ld, getting  "option -dn and -P are incompatible".
No troubles (to build at least) with the GNU ld.

Did the spkg work on mark with the Sun ld?
Or was it with the GNU ld?

I've tried different versions of PATH, LD and LD_ALTEXEC but could not through the configure step with Sun ld...
Any idea of what could be wrong?

<a id='comment:7'></a>On Solaris I had trouble building FFLAS-FFLAPACK because cblas needs to be built with -latlas (ok, expected) and -lrt (realtime library, providing sched_yield).

Once again not sure why the linker is so picky at link time.
I had a similar issue with polybori testing for -lpng12, but that was with a seemingly ill biult GCC with GNU as and ld, and now my GCC looks saner and uses Sun ld and as.

Was it only the fact that solris.patch was uncommited?
That seems to be the last version I crafted.
Sorry about that.
I've done several version of the spkg and fears something got messed up now...

The first is that `0x7f` should obviously be `0xff` (we need the high byte and bytes are still 8 bits). The second is that the low byte is completely ignored: if the process got killed by a signal, we want to know that too.

I think `subprocess.call()` is a good solution since Python recommends it anyway over `os.system()` and there is no need to fiddle with the return code (signals are returned as negative return codes).

The previosu ATLAS 3.8.4 spkg is broken in a similar way, but the undefined symbols there are more worrying, its some cblas_* thing...

On a FreeBSD 8.3 amd64, the build fails quite early when a "cd" command fails.
It might be a "make" issue.

Indeed for some reason the GNU make was not first in my PATH anymore...

+The new atlas release now builds netlib lapack itself, so the lapack tarball is now included in the ATLAS spkg.
 
+* Updated to newest upstream source, various patches are no longer required

+By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings and fail immediately if throttling is enabled. If auto-tuning fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`. On x86, the fast and base targets are the new ATLAS generic targets x86SSE3 and x86SSE2/x86x87.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I got why this is failing:
basically it seems that atlas builds the thread stuff using an assembly version and a mutex version suffixed with _mut, put everything in the static libatlas.a, and then tests if the assembly version is actually faster.
Usually it is and every thing is fine, but if not, then it rebuilds the mutex versions without the mut suffix and adds it to the static libatlas.a.
So when we turn it into a shared library the linker fails because these symbols are available in two different objects we extracted from the static archive.

Now the solution is to modify ATLAS build system which is non-trivial without upstream support but might be feasible, I'll have a look.
At first I wonder why the static archive produced for tuning is just modified (running "ar r") in the "build" phase, and not wiped out and then rebuilt from scratch.

Or just build the shared library from the static one properly ;-), i.e., don't add both (or three?) "versions" of object files to the shared library if they define the same function(s)...

Its been reported upstream (at least variations of these thread related problems) for a couple of months now, but not so much reaction there: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/support-requests/895/.
So my plan is patching here and then propose the patch upstream.
We won't keep a broken lib or prevent integrating a newer version of a lib in Sage because upstream is not reacting or dead, that would be stupid.

Anyway, as I'm now trying to understand ATLAS magical build system, I'll try to solve the other thread related problems as well (not hitting Sage at the moment, but if we plan on supporting FreeBSD that will be a problem, or debian/sparc).

I don't see a really easy way to do that in full generality.
I don't even know what will happen (of course I know what should happen) when linking to the static library, which object file will be picked up to resolve the function call?
Volker's solution is not the right way to go but at least it will easily workaround the problem.

Something along

```

Or similarly run `nm` individually on the `*_mut.o` files, removing the corresponding other object file if appropriate (e.g. `if nm -g $MUT_OBJECT | grep -w $FUNCTION >/dev/null; then rm $ALTERNATE_OBJECT; fi`).

In fact it should work because the bad thread related functions are not built at all because:

```
make[7]: *** [IRun_aff] Aborted (core dumped)
```
whereas on other CPUs it can fail in a different way (that what i had on FreeBSD with a single thread CPU) and let bad functions be built, or on a CPU with multiple threads this will succeeds and build some bad functions even if you passed "-t 0" when configuring ATLAS.

I guess http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#armhardfp could help...

But note I currently have no idea of this soft/hard ABI stuff.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I agree the problem should be dealt with upstream: if they know how that should work, then they'll probably publish a fixed version soon, won't they?

Same machine, 3.10.1.p0, `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` not set (this time with GCC 4.8.0, FWIW):

```
real	1244m45.739s
user	998m42.830s
sys	92m27.150s
Successfully installed atlas-3.10.1.p0
```
So now seems to take even *longer* than 3.10.0 did (although the sysload was occasionally above the number of cores).

Could you try generating archdefs for this architecture? (unless there are already some, but in that case I don't know what to do... maybe Volker can help)
Then we can package them in the spkg.
Instruction are here: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/atlas_devel/node26.html
Basically keep the ATLAS build dir and run make ArchNew.

This looks suspicious:

```
checking whether GMP is 4.0 or greater... yes
checking for ATLAS >= 3.0... configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
```
while it should be

```
checking whether GMP is 4.0 or greater... yes
checking for ATLAS >= 3.0... found
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
```

(I always get a syntax error in `configure`, so it's likely there's even more broken crap in it; see #748.)

Could you "unapply" our weird "patch" to IML's `configure` and reinstall it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`?

Volker crafted an autotools stub to pack shared libraries and we install from there.

The easiest solution is to call ATLAS Makefile install target.
That will install headers (maybe requiring the incdir option) and static libraries which IMHO is a good idea.

Of course I have it, as does sage.math (which I had checked, also for system-wide libs).  I guess John was actually testing on boxen.math, which does **not** have it.
