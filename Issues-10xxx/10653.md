All occurrences of "topic" in `src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py` were changed to "rubric" long ago.  (Git blame says it was in 2011 and 2012.)  So there is no longer an issue here.

Two instances of `topic` were changed to `rubric` in #12645.

Two instances of `RUBRIC` were introduced in #11935.

Are both `rubric` and `RUBRIC` ok? Should we homogenize?

The Sphinx documentation has the "rubric" directive in lowercase:

- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html

Not sure if we have a different tradition.

That can be a different ticket anyway
given the numerous occurrences across our sources.
