<a id='comment:14'></a>Yes, you are right, so this PR homogenizes to `RUBRIC:`.  A quick search of the src directory found 98 occurrences of `rubric:` (in 25 files) and 116 occurrences of `RUBRIC:` (in 44 files), but this seemed to be the only file that had both.  (Also, I think that all of the other occurrences of `<keyword>::` in this file are all caps.)  Thanks for the suggestion.

<a id='comment:17'></a>The Sphinx documentation has the "rubric" directive in lowercase:

- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html

Not sure if we have a different tradition.

That can be a different ticket anyway
given the numerous occurrences across our sources.
