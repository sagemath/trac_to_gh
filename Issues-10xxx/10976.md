<a id='comment:3'></a>I have a workaround I am testing for this (patch coming soon) that recognizes some subgroups of permutation groups (including stabilizer subgroups of the symmetric group), and can compute the order very quickly (~600 microseconds).  The running time of foo(200) above is still about a second, because GAP takes that long to construct the stabilizer group and give us back the generators.

In the future, I can add some more cases, or try to develop a more general theory for quickly computing these group orders (the special case I added is based on a argument from graph theory).

```
sage: def foo(n):
....:     G = SymmetricGroup(n)

<a id='comment:14'></a>I wish we had line-by-line commenting... Anyway:

* Change "that" to "for which" below?

```
        1321	        # Special case: certain subgroups of the symmetric group that Gap reports 
 	1322	        # generators of the form ((1, 2), (1, 3), ..., (1, m))
```

* Delete "the order of " below:

```
        1330      "We then know that the order of this group is isomorphic to S_n" -- rewrite
```

* Is there confusion between "n" and "m" in the comments?

* It would be nice to have a doctest like this:

```
sage: [SymmetricGroup(n).stabilizer(1)._gap_().Size() for n in [2..10]]
[1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880]
sage: [SymmetricGroup(n).stabilizer(1)._order() for n in [2..10]]

If we ever move to git, we could use gerrit.  I don't know if there are good line-by-line commenting tools for hg.

I think it's more an issue of the code review tool we're using, e.g., trac.  For example, http://code.google.com/ has line-by-line code review annotation, and fully supports Mercurial.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Wow, at least one of those doctest failures shows that there is a mistake in this algorithm:

I think that the author was perhaps assuming that the generators are all transpositions, but didn't test this:

sage: G.gens()

It does, sort of, but the .patch file actually had two separate HG commits in it, which "we don't do".  I (the reviewer) have replaced it by a new patch with only one commit, and fixed the patch log description to start with "Trac #10976".
