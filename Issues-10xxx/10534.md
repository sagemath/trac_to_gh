```
- deprecate `ChooseNK` (in `sage.combinat.choose_nk`) and `SplitNK` (in `sage.combinat.split_nk`).
- clean `sage.combinat.subword` and `sage.combinat.subset`
  - inheritance from `Parent`
  - much better iteration/random generation
  - ...

And become more pep8 compliant ;=)

Hi Vincent,

Your patch looks good except a few remarks:

- the field Author below is for credits. You should put your real name and
  not your login.

- the documentation now says:

    ```
    [...]
    The elements of the output are tuples of Python int (and not Sage Integer).
    [...]
    It's element are returned as plain list of python int.
   ```
   At least one of those two sentences is wrong. Also they seems a little
   redundent. This should be fixed.

I'm sorry for not having the time to put a review patch, nor finish the review
now.

Thank you for modifying this.

That's right. Output value are now tuples and it is fully specified.

Hi Vincent,

I need more time to review your long patch. I just notice the following:

```
file: sage/combinat/choose_nk.py
85	            sage: [0,2] in c52   # trac XXXX 
```
You probably want to replace XXXX by an actual number. I'll continue my review tomorrow (hopefully)

Florent

Hi Florent

> I need more time to review your long patch. 


Certainly. Thanks for the review.

I have three important design questions relative to that patch and the Combinatorial classes which it modify
* should the attributes of a CombinatorialClass be visible like S.w or do we prefer S._w (some code in graphs uses a direct call to S.w) ?
* what should be the inheritance/relations between say Subsets (subset of a given set) and Subsets_k (subset of size k of a given set) ?
* what should be the output of Subwords ? tuple, list, strings, any user defined type ? Actually, if you initialize it with list (resp. tuple, string) it output lists (resp. tuple, string).

This is because the methods _element_constructor_(self, x) are not directly tested. There should be a comment "# indirect doctest" after the corresponding test. Basically, this function is used to build an element of a parent, but it is called through the method __call__ of the parent (which is implemented in Parent).

This is much more ennoying and I do not know why.

Helloooooooooooooooo !!!

While I read your patch, two things :
* an "It's" should become an "its"
* why do you change the ouput type from lists to tuples ?

Btw, sorry I did not answer your comment many months ago, I may have missed the warning from trac : I had set the ticket to `needs_info` because you seemed to be asking rather fundamental questions which would have had an impact on the patch, so that it would have been a pity to review the patch if you intended to change it so much later.

Have you had an answer from Florent since ?

Nathann

Hello,

I have made a branch from the latest patch, but only partially. I have not touched the files `set_partition` and `set_partition_ordered`. 

Maybe one could just try to get this smaller changes in ?

Ok. From the commit you proposed, I think we could
- deprecate `ChooseNK` and `SplitNK` as it is used nowhere and subsumed by subsets and set partitions.
- do some more cleaning in `combination.py`, `subset.py` and `subwords.py`:
    - remove the inheritance from `CombinatorialClass` and make them inherit from `Parent`. We would set the category to `EnumeratedSets().Finite()`
    - better iteration
    - make `Subwords` work with words as input

      ```
      sage: Subwords(Word([1,2,3,4,5]))
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      ValueError: datatype should be str, list or tuple
      ```
    - etc
If you agree with this, I can modify the ticket description and propose a commit.

Hey Vincent, I've gone through and it looks good (I tried to change the `element_class` workaround, but `Set_object_enumerated` is actually a subclass of `Parent` causing layout conflicts...uggg). I've made some minor tweaks and changed the strings to the python 3 `format`. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review. Other things (like removing `CombinatorialClass` from `Combinations` and the `element_class` thing) can be on followups.
