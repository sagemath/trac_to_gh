Try version 2.4 even. This has been discussed to death several times on sage-devel.
Version 2.1 and over are slower than what we currently have. Plus from experience
in sage-on-gentoo where at some stage we experimented with pexpect 2.4, some plotting broke down in the notebook.

Aren't the two links the same?

So, you say that there might be a performance problem with more recent versions of pexpect. That's bad, because the idea was to *get rid of* a performance problem by upgrading...

2.4 is not released yet. Here's a package for 2.3 that I created.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/pexpect-2.3.spkg

but on my OpenSolaris machine, this 2.3 package results in one doctest failure, which is:

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/expect.py
```

The interface must be semi-working, as the interface to R works - or at lease the R doctest does not fail. Here's the error message of the failed doctest. 

```
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py
         [14.8 s]
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/expect.py

         [18.4 s]
sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py
         [20.4 s]
```

I think in some cases where we call external programs there are probably better ways of doing this. For example
* R has libraries, I expect we can call R via the libraries, rather than on the command line. 
* Mathematica uses the [Mathlink](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/MathLinkAndExternalProgramCommunicationOverview.html) protocol to communicate between the kernel and front end. How to use [Mathlink](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/MathLinkAndExternalProgramCommunicationOverview.html) is documented, and has been used by at least open-source program ([JMath](http://robotics.caltech.edu/~radford/jmath/)) to work with Mathematica. But Sage calls Mathematica via the command line.

While 2.4 is not on sourceforge but on pypi.python.org [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pexpect) I think we can call it released unless you have other infos (from author/mailing list).
As far as I remember, last time we tried pexpect-2.4 on sage-on-gentoo it broke plotting in the notebook. Can you try to do some plotting in the notebook with this version of pexpect? Digged my email archive, more precisely:

```
g=sin(x); plot(g,(x,-pi,3*pi/2))

Bump this. There is a pexpect 3.1 now at http://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ (note: the sourceforge address will redirect you there). For a long time I thought pexpect was done and there wouldn't be anymore release.

I think if the project is alive they may take request from us.

> What is the recommended way to measure Sage performance?


Good question, I can only talk about the command line interface:

Of course there's `time ./sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/` (probably with `-p`; one can also set `SAGE_TEST_ITER` and `SAGE_TEST_GLOBAL_ITER`).  Only testing the interfaces that actually use pexpect (and where the external program is really installed) makes more sense.

Tests that make heavy use of (stand-alone) Maxima/`ecl`, Singular, `gap` and `gp` are meaningful as well.  I cannot really list them right now, but `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/` and especially `src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py` are known to fall into that category IIRC.

Before testing, it IMHO makes sense to remove or rename `$DOT_SAGE/timings*.json`, otherwise doctests will get reordered with undesirable impact on the resource usage, influencing the measured timings.

You should do some things like

```
    %timeit gp.eval('2+3')
    %timeit gp('2') + gp('3')
    %timeit axiom('2+3')
```
etc.   The doctesting won't testing latency much, and latency is *the* main issue with performance with the pexpect interfaces.
The other is size, e.g.,

```
    %timeit s=str(gp.eval('2^10000'))

So it is a little bit all over the place, but generally 3 to 4 times slower with pexpect 3.3. I don't know if it is acceptable. Since upstream is now alive and well we could take it as an issue with them?

It's important to understand that the use case of pexpect by Sage is massively different than the use case of pexpect for absolutely everybody else -- for them some latency issues are no big deal, but for us they are.\n\nIncidentally, I think there is no caching going on despite what %timeit says...",

It's important to understand that the use case of pexpect by Sage is massively different than the use case of pexpect for absolutely everybody else -- for them some latency issues are no big deal, but for us they are.

Incidentally, I think there is no caching going on despite what %timeit says...

Apparently the performance problem originates with this old commit:

https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/commit/600463686284ea102548f5e0bf51582db051dc78#diff-dfb232b43530f0961894e09a0d862aa4R1048

after commenting out

https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/blob/3.x/pexpect/__init__.py#L1540

```
                #time.sleep(0.0001)
```

performance changes from

```
sage: sage: %timeit gp.eval('2+3')
1000 loops, best of 3: 427 ¬µs per loop
sage: sage: %timeit gp.eval('2+3')
1000 loops, best of 3: 449 ¬µs per loop
```

to this

```
sage: %timeit gp.eval('2+3')
The slowest run took 175.25 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 76.3 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit gp.eval('2+3')
The slowest run took 7.85 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 76.4 ¬µs per loop

Will it? After all unless there are quite a number of other changes, it is the current situation with 2.0, isn't it? Upgrading without patching would decrease the CPU load if I am not mistaken.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting).

I'll have to look closer at the code.  Haven't tested yet, but I guess it'll get worse the longer the net computation in the subprocess takes; the examples above only do short toy computations and don't take the overall CPU time into account.  (It may lead to effectively doubling `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` in ptestlong.)

Probably.  In fact, for me ptestlong with 3.3 (unpatched) went faster than with 2.0, although only slightly, under the same conditions (constant low load).  (But in both cases I had some process apparently still waiting for Singular after all other tests had already finished, so the wall time got messed up a bit.)

But I'm ok with first upgrading here and removing the `sleep`, then checking what else we could tweak on another ticket.

Subclassing, probably with individual changes for different interfaces or dynamically changing parameters is the way to go I think.

While we could perhaps do some parts in Cython, leaving Python of course puts more burden of portablility on us, depending on what exactly we do.

Why do you think it's busy waiting? It looks like it's reading with a timeout, which is not busy waiting.

Well, rather the delay should be configurable.

But the whole `expect_loop()` and `read_nonblocking()` look pretty messy.  We should perhaps simply overwrite one or both with a version that fits our needs.  The whole class certainly isn't written for performance.


Note that the behaviour also depends on the writer (i.e., the subprocess); ECL for example is extremely poor in that it doesn't write strings, but really character by character, such that in the worst case we here would end up with at least `len(s)` * 0.1 ms (and at least len(s) context switches, not including the system calls themselves, where pexpect doesn't only call `select()` and probably `read()`, but also `waitpid()` because of the `isalive()` checks).

Unless the timeout is `None`, it *is* busy waiting.

With a larger timeout, it gets less worse, but is still busy waiting.

Of course on a follow-up, as I said before.

`sleep(0)` shouldn't be necessary because of the (many!) system calls in the loop.

Ok, it's not as bad as I first thought, since the loop is exited upon the first timeout (which is on the *total* time spent in `expect_loop()`, but also used in `select()`).  So it depends on what happens in the application upon timeout, and the timeout chosen.

Isn't that just the overhead of starting up the process the first time you run it? If I subsequently send other strings to `gp`, such as `gp.eval('3+4')`, I get similar times. That's not consistent with caching.

What advantage can we gain from using Cython to re-implement? I think it might be better to propose a different upstream patch, something like:

   time.sleep(self.maxSleep)

where maxSleep corresponds to a new optional parameter that defaults to 0.0001 for backward compatibility but which we can set to 0 in `expect.py`.  I have tested `time.sleep(0)` and it seems to have the same end effect in Sage as commenting it out (and the same failures upstream).  Given that they have apparently used similar strategies in the past, by making it optional I think we can expect upstream to agree to the change and that it would be incorporated into future versions of pexpect with no impact on Sage maintenance.

I wasn't specifically talking about the `sleep(0.0001)` issue, it was just a general comment.

We could
1. Directly call system calls instead of using `os.foo()`, leading to better performance and better reliability, especially w.r.t. interrupts.
2. Use C strings instead of Python strings for performance.
3. More generally change/add functionality without depending on upstream.

I have no idea what changes in Python 3 for system calls.

It happens a lot in practice: it happens when a `pexpect` process has a large output (which is then followed by a prompt). See the last example of [comment:30]

> If the goal is to change/add functionality without depending on upstream perhaps the best choice would be to re-write `pexpect` entirely in cython, e.g. `cexpect`.

I don't really want to fork completely `pexpect`. It might be sufficient to change only `expect` and `read_nonblocking`.

No, with "interrupts" I am talking about CTRL-C, a.k.a. `KeyboardInterrupt` in Python. The problem is that Python's `os` interface really doesn't deal with those well. Here is the problem:

```
try:
    result = os.read(fd)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # ... ?
```
The problem is that, when an interrupt happens, you simply cannot know whether the `read()` call actually succeeded and what the result is (the interrupt could happen while assigned the result for example).

I don't know to what extent this is actually a problem in practice, but it is something that worries me about `pexpect`.

In Cython, interrupt handling has to be done manually, which means that it can be done in a predictable way.

My point was that I would not expect something like `%timeit s=str(gp.eval('2^10000'))` to be particularly fast.  But maybe it is important to note that `pexpect` already does make an effort to allow faster scanning for prompt if it can be represented as a fixed string rather than a regular expression.

It seems to me that this is exactly the essential part of `pexpect` on which Sage depends. Most of the rest of `pexpect` is just program interface and portability.

Precisely. The easiest way to get access to the Trac branches is using `git-trac`: 
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html

Once you have Sage and `git-trac` set up, you should be able to do

```
$ git trac checkout 10295
$ make
```

I asked upstream for guidance, this is what they have to say so far:

But I don't see how that could have happened when you're still calling `E.sendline()` - clearly there is still a reference to the object, so it shouldn't be garbage collected.

Could something else be closing an fd explicitly? I have run into odd effects before because the numbers representing fds are readily reused. If one fd gets closed while its corresponding 'handle' object (e.g. a `PtyProcess` instance) still exists, when the handle object is garbage collected, it may close an unrelated file which has been opened in the meantime:


```
A =  open('foo')
# handle A with fd=5
os.close(5)
B = open('bar')
# handle A with fd=5
# handle B with fd=5
del A
# handle A is garbage collected, closing fd 5
B.read()
# Bad fd!

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A119):
> Could something else be closing an fd explicitly?


This is a likely explanation of what is happening. The "problem" is that `pexpect` was split up in two independent parts (`pexpect` and `ptyprocess`) and the Sage wrapper `SageSpawn` tries to override the wrong `close()` method.

5 loops, best of 10: 380 ms per loop

The same now with `%time` shows that the time increase is mainly in `user` time, so it's really the `pexpect` code which is causing the slowdown:

pexpect 2.0:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 184 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 188 ms
Wall time: 384 ms
```

pexpect 4.0.1:

sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 203 ms, sys: 7 ms, total: 210 ms
Wall time: 405 ms

Looking better now:

pexpect 2.0 upstream:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 184 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 188 ms
Wall time: 384 ms
```

pexpect 4.0.1 upstream:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 308 ms, sys: 9 ms, total: 317 ms
Wall time: 571 ms
```

pexpect 4.0.1 + Sage patches:

```
sage: %time _ = str(gp("2^2^22"))
CPU times: user 26 ms, sys: 2 ms, total: 28 ms
Wall time: 231 ms
```

No, I opened an issue upstream that was quickly closed. And it mirrored at least another issue opened by another distro maintainer. This file is only used with python3. See [https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/issues/297](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/issues/297)

See [attachment:old-pexpect.log] and [attachment:new-pexpect.log] for the output of

```
./sage -t --optional=sage src/sage/interfaces/*.py* src/sage/interfaces/*.py* src/sage/interfaces/*.py* src/sage/interfaces/*.py* src/sage/interfaces/*.py*
```
(test all files in `src/sage/interfaces` 5 times).

The total time of those tests is (I'm not claiming that anything is statistically significant):

old:

```
Total time for all tests: 378.2 seconds
    cpu time: 86.5 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 365.2 seconds
```

new:

```
Total time for all tests: 360.3 seconds
    cpu time: 93.6 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 347.1 seconds

So the CPU time increased by a significant amount, which is bad...

I tried the doctests in `sage/interface` again, now with 10 runs. Results are essentially the same:

old:

```
Total time for all tests: 722.6 seconds
    cpu time: 170.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 696.9 seconds
```

new:

```
Total time for all tests: 710.4 seconds
    cpu time: 185.6 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 685.0 seconds
```

Is it really a problem if the CPU goes up while the total time goes down?

As always, *it depends*.

Do we burn more carbon that way?

More seriously, in case the potential cpu time is wasted otherwise, perhaps not (*wall time* then matters; but even on a battery-powered notebook, the answer might yet be different).  But if it's not, i.e., if other processes suffer from getting less, it does of course.  So it mainly depends on the user, or rather the usage of the machine Sage is running on (and hence potentially many users).

Think of pexpect's purpose; not counting newlines, 2000 characters is 80 columns by 25 lines, so pretty reasonable even with ASCII art output (well, perhaps twice that, but not vastly more.).

In the same sense, benchmarking with `gp("2<sup>2</sup>22")` seems hardly appropriate, IMHO.

Latency matters, more than throughput.  (And in a multitasking environment, overall resource usage.)

Large outputs do actually happen in Sage. It's not so crazy.

Yep, but certainly not the typical usage scenario of pexpect, so I wouldn't blame upstream for their default buffer size.

I'm not very worried about the increased CPU time (yet ;-) ); it's just that we shouldn't exclusively focus on bare throughput.

If the number and/or size of objects passed is huge, it's probably more worth thinking of other solutions.

I do not find the difference in reported times for the sage/interface tests at all disturbing. I seriously doubt that it would be noticeable to the average user. At the same time the new gap timings suggest that certain heavy users might be pleasantly surprized.

I plan to test this change some time in the next few days.  One thing that I want out of this change is support for unicode in external packages. I expect to be able to give it a positive review.

I have made one additional pull request to `pexpect`: [https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/pull/308/files](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/pull/308/files)

It is really quite trivial and it provided yet another easy optimization. If some reviewer agrees, I will add that patch to the branch here.
