The method `iter_morphisms` may iterate through all morphisms (infinite iterator) or through all morphisms having particular lengths for the image of each letter. Recently, I needed something in the middle, that is, a finite iterator that behaves like the infinite one. Thus, I added a new possible type for the argument (tuple) which specifies a range for the sum of the lengths of the images. Here is an example:

``` 
    sage: W = Words('ab')
    sage: for m in W.iter_morphisms( (2, 4) ): print m
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->aa, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->aa, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->ab, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->ab, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->ba, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->ba, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->bb, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->bb, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->aa
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->ab
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->ba
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->bb
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->aa
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->ab
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->ba
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->bb
```

Patch to be posted soon.

I dislike the parameter name `l` for two reasons. First, it might be confused with the digit `1`. Second, because it is not significant. I suggest you use the name `lengths` or `order_iterating`, well, anything else more significant.\n2. The possible values for `l` are quite confusing. List means something, tuple, something else... I don't know if there's a more understandable interface that could be offered. Maybe there could be a parameter `lengths_interval` or `fixed_lengths`, etc. that could distinguish the different cases.\n3. The sentence \"The length of the list must be the number of letters in the alphabet, and the `i`-th integer of `l` determines the length of the word mapped to by the `i`-th letter of the (ordered) alphabet\" is not very clear. Maybe it would be better to describe it with mathematical expressions (although it's harder to read in terminal mode). I would suggest something simpler such as : \"If `l` is a list, then it describes the length of the images for each letter of the morphism.\"\n\nI know my ideas aren't very clear, but maybe it could still inspire you into improving the docstring. I'll wait for your answer to resume the review.

OK. The parameter `l` could be changed. I agree. But, to keep it backward
compatible, we still need to support `l`. Maybe `arg` would be more adapted.

I disagree on that. It is not C code, it is python. For example, it is OK to do :

```
sage: Permutation((5,3,2,4,1))   # tuple means cycle notation
[5, 4, 2, 1, 3]
sage: Permutation([5,3,2,4,1])   # list means images of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in that order
[5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
``` 

The problems with many arguments like `lengths_interval` or `fixed_lengths` is (1) you still need to look at the documentation to use and understand those arguments, (2) you need to type the name of those argument everytime you use them and (3) the code needs to consider inconsistencies, that is, if both argument are defined by the user.

I suggest :

"The length of the list must be equal to the size of the alphabet, and the
`i`-th integer of `l` determines the length of the word mapped to by the `i`-th
letter of the (ordered) alphabet"

I do not get those doctest failures. Did you rebuild your branch !?

I tested the two patches on sage-4.6 and all tests passed. The documentation looked fine, except for a typo I corrected in a review patch.
