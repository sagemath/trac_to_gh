This chunk of code in fast_arith.pyx:

```

    cdef public long long c_inverse_mod_longlong(self, long long a, long long m) except -1:
        cdef long long g, s, t
        g = self.c_xgcd_longlong(a,m, &s, &t)
        s = s % m
        if s < 0:
            s = s + m
        return s
```
should raise an exception if g != 1, so should be

```

I started to look at this. 
I had difficulties trying to find a test that could hit the case `g != 1`.
I found the following:

```
from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
mm = MultiModularBasis_base([6, 10])
```
which raises another problem, since the new exception is not trapped:

```
sage: mm.crt([1,2])
13
```
This is wrong since 13 is not equal to 2 mod 10...
