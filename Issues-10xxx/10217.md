I started to look at this. 
I had difficulties trying to find a test that could hit the case `g != 1`.
I found the following:

```
from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
mm = MultiModularBasis_base([6, 10])
```
which raises another problem, since the new exception is not trapped:

```
sage: mm.crt([1,2])
13
```
This is wrong since 13 is not equal to 2 mod 10...
