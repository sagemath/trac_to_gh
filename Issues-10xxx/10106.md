#10092 added 4 lines of code: 

```
export FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
```

but using export and the variable name at the same time is not portable. For improved portability, which will work with any shell, 

```
FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export FC
F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77
F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90
F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95
```

should work.
