Reported in [this question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/375/any-way-to-turn-off-error-msg-when-i-catch-the) at Ask Sage, there is a bug in some infinite loops which causes a `RuntimeError` to be printed, but not thrown as an exception.  This means it cannot be caught by `try/except` blocks.

```
def number(expr):
    try:    
        n = N(expr)
    except RuntimeError:
        n = 0
    return n
```

```
sage: expr=log(arcsin(e))
sage: a=number(expr)
Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded in __subclasscheck__' in <type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'> ignored
sage: a
0
```

Similar problems are reported with `N(log(NaN))`.

This is probably a python exception that occurs in a cython routine that does have any means to report the exception (see http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/language_basics.html ) further up. This example illustrates the behaviour:

```
%cython
def error_raiser():
    raise RuntimeError, "my error"

cdef int unreportable_error_producer():
    error_raiser()
    return 1

cdef int reportable_error_producer() except -1:
    error_raiser()
    return 1
    
def call_this(reportable=0):
    if reportable:
        return reportable_error_producer()
    else:
        return unreportable_error_producer()
```
which results in

```
sage: call_this(reportable=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: my error
sage: call_this()
Exception RuntimeError: 'my error' in '[...]unreportable_error_producer' ignored
0
```
The 0 return value there is rather arbitrary, I assume.

You can investigate the errors that arise a little easier by calling:

```
sys.setrecursionlimit(100)
N(log(NaN))
log(arcsin(e)).n()
```
The traceback clearly shows a ping-pong between sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber.log and sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber.log so that's the real source of the error. It looks like a cython routine involved in creating the corresponding error object subsequently gets bitten by the already exhausted recursion depth and has no way of propagating that exception up.
