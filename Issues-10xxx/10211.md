Yes, this works.  Thank you for picking this up!

By the way, if #5945 is merged, then this is definitely the right way to deal with this bad declarations.  However, if #5945 is not merged, then the right approach here would be to simply delete the bad declarations since it seems they are not actually used anywhere in Sage.
