<a id='comment:4'></a>The patch I just sent strives for three advancements in eulerian_circuit():

* It should close this ticket. :-)

* It should run in O(|E|) time.

* It should find eulerian circualiton in disconnected cases like

```
Graph({0: [], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [1], 4: []})
```

where previous one failed. This is similar to the trac #12108. Notice, that you need to apply the patch I sent to that ticket before testing this code -- if you don't, one of the tests fails because is_eulerian() doesn't work correctly.

During testing I was surprised by way Sage handles multiple loops:

```
sage: g=Graph({0: [0, 0]})
sage: g.degree(0)
4
sage: g.delete_edge(g.edge_iterator(0).next())
sage: g.degree(0)
0
```

I think that Sage should either reject multiple loops at the beginning (merge them to one, for example), or handle them as separate. This is surprising behavior. What do you think?
