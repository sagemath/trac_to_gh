The long doctests pass for me with 4.6.alpha2 + SageNB 0.8.3 on sage.math.

My current local setup is limited, so I don't know about the Selenium tests.  As far as I'm aware, we still need to update the SageNB Se tests for the latest released version of Selenium RC.

It would be really great if #9920 were slipped into this as well.

What do we need to do to review this?  We already reviewed the individual patches.
