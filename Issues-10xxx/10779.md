Hello! 

- Please refer to the [conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html) for how to write in ReST markup. For instance, you need a blank line after `::` for getting verbatim environment. Also, please note that, a verbatim environment is preceded by `::`. 

- It'd be nice if you also go ahead and add more doctests. Also, please correct the docstrings formatting whenever you can -- like codifying `self`, `True` and such by using two backticks... 

- Major: "ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest."

Hoping to hear from you soon... 

Cheers, Kannappan.
