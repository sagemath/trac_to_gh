The output of the crystal isomorphism is currently different whether or not one specifies edge_labels = True.
For example without edge_labels = True the result is a bijection between the vertices of the graph:

```
    sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(6, .2)
    sage: D.is_isomorphic(D, certify = True)
    (True, {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5})
```

If in addition one specifies edge_labels=True this changes to some
labeling of an extended digraph(?):

```
    sage: D.is_isomorphic(D,edge_labels=True, certify = True)
    {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10} 
```

Would it be possible to make the output with edge_labels = True consistent?
