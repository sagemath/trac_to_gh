Applying [attachment: trac_10283.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10283/trac_10283.patch.gz) to Sage 4.6.1.alpha1, building the HTML version of the reference manual results in the following warning:

```
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.6.1.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/crypto/mq/mpolynomialsystem.rst:: WARNING: citation not found: CB07
```

And building the PDF version results in the following warning:

```
resolving references...
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.6.1.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/index.rst:: WARNING: citation not found: CB07
```

The warning is fixed in [attachment: trac-10283_reviewer.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10283/trac-10283_reviewer.patch.gz), which needs reviewing.
