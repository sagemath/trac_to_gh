<div id="comment:0"></div>

The [sage-words google code](http://code.google.com/p/sage-words/) was merged into sage-3.2.2 two years ago in December 2008 (#4653). At that time, about a dozen of objects were added in the sage pickle jar using that code.

Then, in January 2009, we realized that all of our work was not that good and we started to change all the hierarchy of classes. Basically, we decided after discussions that it was better to get the mathematical classes independent of the chosen representation. This was achieved by ticket #6519 merged in sage-4.1.1 during summer 2009.

Twist in the code were made to make the dozen of old word objects pickled from version < 4.1.1 still usable. As written by Franco Saliola in #6519 :

```
this way, an old-style word can be unpickled, and during the unpickling, it
gets converted to a new-style word, and the user is given a warning to re-save
the word

[...]

This is a temporary fix: since the WordContent code is not necessary for any
other part of Sage, it will be deleted in a few months. In the meantime, if
there is anyone with some saved word objects, then unpickling will work. 
```

Those deprecation warnings now exists since more than one year, so it's now time to complete the cleaning. As I [wrote](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/440ae08a74c35df7) on sage-combinat devel mailing list in June 2010 :

```
I would like to remove those 6 pickled object from the pickle jar and replace
them with the new generation of words that got in Sage during summer 2009. This
way, it would really make sure that we do not break the pickle of objects that
are really used. Also, this will allow us to then clean up the code a lot,
because some kind of arabesques are being done to support the old stuff...

I know William prefer to keep old objects in the pickle jar, but in this case,
I would like to remove them.... Will put time on this when I have time...
```

Then, William answered in the same conversation :

```
I do prefer keeping old pickles (that's the point of the pickle jar), but I
definitely don't want to get in the way of the sage-combinatorics group, and
understand that your code is under very active development.

Thanks for the work you're doing on cleanup!

William 
```

So let's do the cleanup now!

By the way, the current output of the unpickle testing (taken from `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx`) is ugly and will be fixed by this ticket :

```
sage: std = os.environ['SAGE_DATA'] + '/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2'
sage: print "x"; sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(std)
x...
Successfully unpickled 586 objects.
Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
```

The goal of this ticket is to remove, update or add objects to the pickle jar so that one can remove the deprecated file `sage/combinat/words/utils.py` and `sage/combinat/words/content.py`. The following objects are OK and can be kepted as is:

- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_lyndon_word_LyndonWords_evaluation__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_lyndon_word_LyndonWords_nk__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_lyndon_word_StandardBracketedLyndonWords_nk__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_subword_Subwords_w__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_subword_Subwords_wk__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_words_alphabet_OrderedAlphabet_Finite__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_words_alphabet_OrderedAlphabet_NaturalNumbers__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_words_alphabet_OrderedAlphabet_PositiveIntegers__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_generators_WordGenerator__.sobj`
- [OK] `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_Words_n__.sobj`

The following 19 objects must be deleted or updated because they are affected by the deletion of `sage/combinat/words/utils.py` and `sage/combinat/words/word_content.py`:

- `_class__sage_combinat_words_morphism_WordMorphism__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_shuffle_product_ShuffleProduct_overlapping__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_shuffle_product_ShuffleProduct_overlapping_r__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_shuffle_product_ShuffleProduct_shifted__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_shuffle_product_ShuffleProduct_w1w2__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_suffix_trees_ImplicitSuffixTree__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_suffix_trees_SuffixTrie__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_utils_Factorization__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_AbstractWord__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_Word_over_Alphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_Word_over_OrderedAlphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_content_WordContentFromFunction__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_content_WordContentFromList__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_word_generators_ChristoffelWord_Lower__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_FiniteWords_length_k_over_OrderedAlphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_FiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_InfiniteWords_over_OrderedAlphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_Words_over_Alphabet__.sobj`
- `_class__sage_combinat_words_words_Words_over_OrderedAlphabet__.sobj`

The pickle jar is the file `data/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2`. As a reference, a ticket where objects were removed/updated from the pickle jar: #8911.

Short version: positive review for the proposed changes and the proposed patch.

Slightly longer version. I dropped the provided tarball 

    [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/slabbe/pickle_jar.tar.bz2](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/slabbe/pickle_jar.tar.bz2)

into place and tested unpickling; everything works:

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
Successfully unpickled 586 objects.
Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
sage: 
```
I also compared new pickle jar directory with the old (using `diff -rq`), and no other pickles were effected.

Some notes about things I learned on the pickle jar during this ticket:

1. Create a Sage object :

```
sage: w = Word(range(10))
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```

2. Add this object to the current pickle jar:

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.picklejar(w)
```

3. By default, the current pickle jar is in `SAGE_ROOT/tmp/pickle_jar-4.6.1` :

```
cd sage-4.6.1/tmp/pickle_jar-4.6.1
ls
_class__sage_combinat_words_word_FiniteWord_list__.sobj
_class__sage_combinat_words_word_FiniteWord_list__.txt
```

4. The command to create a .tar.bz2 from a directory:
 

```
tar -jcvf archive_name.tar.bz2 directory_to_compress 
```

It will not be "All tests passed!" because the buildbot is testing the applied patches with sage-4.6.2 which still uses the old pickles. But no other error should be raised.

Not really. That is the default directory name when one creates pickles :

```
sage: import os
sage: os.listdir(SAGE_ROOT+'/tmp')
['COPYING.txt', 'install', 'README.txt', 'sage-README-osx.txt', 'VERSION.txt']
sage: from sage.structure.sage_object import picklejar    
sage: picklejar(matrix([0,1,1]))
sage: os.listdir(SAGE_ROOT+'/tmp')

sage: os.listdir(SAGE_ROOT+'/tmp/pickle_jar-4.6.2')

```

I think there are no documentation anywhere for adding/removing objects from the pickle jar. So, if there is anything I should do better, we should write it somewhere so that the next time, it will be done the right way.

Okay, point taken.  You can leave the file as it is.

Question is: why does the default directory name for creating pickles contain the version number of Sage?  It might be better to simply use "$SAGE_ROOT/tmp/pickle_jar" without version number.

Personally, I don't have argument for one or the other. But I know that Nicolas Thiéry proposed in #10768 (Revisit the pickle jar procedure) that :

"For each version of Sage (say 4.6.2), a fresh pickle jar (say pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2) would be produced by the release manager, and *added* to the Sage distribution."

So if this proposition is followed, maybe version number could be kept as a default. Am I confusing the name of the directory with the name of the archive?
