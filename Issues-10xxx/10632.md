#trac 10632

This patch adds the following new features for crystals:

* CrystalOfTableaux now also accepts half-integer shapes for spin tableaux for type `B_n` and `D_n`

* Spin crystals have a new method _repr_ using the signature representation and a new latex method

* New latex method for Crystal category using digraph

* New set_latex_options in the digraph method for crystals

* Moved method to_highest_weight from HighestWeightCrystals to Crystals (since it is possible to specify an index_set); appropriate exceptions are raised when the crystal is not highest weight.

* Shortcut for 3d plotting of crystals

* Fixed bad doc tests in HighestWeightCrystals

* New alternative implementation of KR crystals of type `A_{2n}^{(2)}` dual by using the B_n classical decomposition

* Implementation of KR crystals `B^{n,s}` of types `B_n^{(1)}`, `C_n^{(1)}`, `D_{n+1}^{(2)}`

* Added a comparison method to Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals (in order to be able to use digraph methods for tensor products of KR crystals)

* removes the dual method for CartanType BC (since for crystals it is more natural to view its dual not as a relabeled diagram and to ensure that the method classical correctly gives type B and C)

Should be merged simultaneously with #10485.

Depends on #10723

Depends on #10485

Apply trac_10632-kr-improvments-as.patch

Ignore the pickle jar. An earlier version of the patch broke some existing pickles but the current one does not.
