#trac 10632

This patch adds the following new features for crystals:

* CrystalOfTableaux now also accepts half-integer shapes for spin tableaux for type `B_n` and `D_n`

* Spin crystals have a new method `_repr_` using the signature representation and a new latex method

* New latex method for Crystal category using digraph

* New set_latex_options in the digraph method for crystals

* Moved method to_highest_weight from HighestWeightCrystals to Crystals (since it is possible to specify an index_set); appropriate exceptions are raised when the crystal is not highest weight.

* Shortcut for 3d plotting of crystals

* Fixed bad doc tests in HighestWeightCrystals

* New alternative implementation of KR crystals of type `A_{2n}^{(2)}` dual by using the B_n classical decomposition

* Implementation of KR crystals `B^{n,s}` of types `B_n^{(1)}`, `C_n^{(1)}`, `D_{n+1}^{(2)}`

* Added a comparison method to Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals (in order to be able to use digraph methods for tensor products of KR crystals)

* removes the dual method for CartanType BC (since for crystals it is more natural to view its dual not as a relabeled diagram and to ensure that the method classical correctly gives type B and C)

Should be merged simultaneously with #10485.

Depends on #10723

Depends on #10485

Apply trac_10632-kr-improvments-as.patch

Ignore the pickle jar. An earlier version of the patch broke some existing pickles but the current one does not.

This patch substantially improves the support for classical and affine crystal in sage. For classical crystals, it makes it easier to construct crystals of half integral weight in types B and D. For affine crystals, it largely completes the support for Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals by adding the previously unimplemented cases. This is an important enhancement.

This patch must be merged simultaneously with #10485 and after #10723. If all three patches are merged, all doctests pass with sage-4.7.alpha1. The patches have been extensively reviewed in sage-combinat-devel and appropriately revised.

The syntax for specifying optional packages is

```
# optional - pkg1 pkg2
```
no "requires" or "and" should be there.
See 
[http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings)

Also, there are still various places where there is simply an "#optional" without specification.
