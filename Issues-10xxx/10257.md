We should introduce `check_` variants of the Sage memory functions which `raise MemoryError` upon failure.

I also propose to add a BSD-inspired [sage_reallocarray()](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man3/calloc.3?query=reallocarray&arch=i386) function.

Attached branch introduces the functions and uses them in a few places as proof of concept.

<a id='comment:27'></a>Hello,

Why not using this ?

```
cdef inline void* check_allocarray(size_t nmemb, size_t size) except? NULL:
   """
   Allocate memory for ``nmemb`` elements of size ``size``.
   """
   return check_malloc( mul_overflowcheck(nmemb, size) )


cdef inline void* check_malloc(size_t n) except? NULL:
   """
   Allocate ``n`` bytes of memory.
   """
   if n == 0:
      return NULL
   if n == <size_t>(-1):
      raise MemoryError("cannot allocate %s bytes" % n)
   cdef void* ret = sage_malloc(n)
   if ret == NULL:
      raise MemoryError("failed to allocate %s bytes" % n)
   return ret
```
At least, `check_malloc` should have the test `if n==<size_t>-1` (if not already in `sage_malloc`), and other methods as well.

David.

One reason is that the error message would be less clear this way: any overflow would lead to the same error message. With my code, the error message mentions exactly which allocation failed.

> At least, `check_malloc` should have the test if `n==<size_t>-1` (if not already in `sage_malloc`)

Why? The argument to `malloc()` is a number of bytes. Allocating `<size_t>(-1)` bytes will very likely fail anyway.

So we could avoid this test in `check_allocarray`, right?

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hello,

After a long compilation, I did a doc build and a `sage -t --long src/sage/` (very very long...).

All tests pass on my MBA with OSX 10.10.

David.
