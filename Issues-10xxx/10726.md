In Trac #378 (merged in 4.6.1.alpha), a load_attach_path-function was introduced which adds a directory to the paths that will be searched with commands like "load" and "attach". This should be introduced in the appropriate places in the documentation.
These include at least:

- The notebook's help page under "Files and script"

- In the Tutorial -> Programming -> Loading and Attaching Sage Files

- Most likely somewhere in the Reference Manual.
