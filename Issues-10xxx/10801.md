This is a frequently requested feature.  We should start with some little script that does this, and build on it.  I tried all the following, and ran the test suite and it worked fine. 

- rm SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/*.a
- rm SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/lib.*
- rm SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/temp.*
- strip SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/Singular-* SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/gfan   # gfan is a huge win.
- jsmath image fonts are in MoinMoin and are *HUGE*.  Just delete everything related to moinmoin...
- strip SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/*.so
- rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/local/python/site-package/MoinMoin 
- rm all files in SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/ that begin "* Generated by Cython"  (I didn't do that)

---

The patches below actually provide a new `make` target, "`micro_release`", rather than adding a new option to `sage`.

Slightly related: `sage -crap ...` (`local/bin/sage-crap`)

Note that we already have a few `*clean` targets in the top-level Makefile; there could be more (like `strip`), and some of the others could perhaps get improved or extended.

I personally wouldn't use `-strip` for anything else than really stripping debug symbols, i.e., if it is e.g. intended to delete also static libraries (which may be needed if someone installs some package, not necessarily an spkg), I'd choose a different name for such an option (or `make` target).

OK: I'll fix the patch right now.

FUTURE: Yes, but in a future version of this?

>  * Should we delete SPKGs?


FUTURE: It's safer to put a small string in each, to avoid confusion.  This happens automatically when you build a binary with "sage -bdist".   Anyway, this is something that could be added later.

Tested the patches on sage.math and fresh build of Sage-4.7.1:

bjones@sage:/scratch/bjones/sage-4.7.1$ du . -sh

```

So it saved 0.5 GB which is not the 1.0 GB observed by William above. Did you remove stuff by hand in that session that the script doesn't touch? Or maybe because I built the install from source instead of using a binary distribution? 

I'm running `make ptestlong` now, will report back if anything fails.

After producing the micro release, `make ptestlong` had one failure which disappeared when I doctested by hand:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1468.7 seconds
make: *** [ptestlong] Error 128
```
Subsequently by hand:

```
bjones@sage:/scratch/bjones/sage-4.7.1$ sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/tests/startup.py
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/startup.py" 
         [12.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 12.1 seconds
```

Ben:

1. Regarding the size savings, I started with a binary... so we may see a difference.

2. Regarding the startup time failure, this has nothing to do with my patch.  It routinely fails on sage.math.  It's a test that it isn't taking more than 2 seconds on sage.math.  I put it in back when we got the startup time down to solidly be < 1 second on sage.math, since I didn't want people to screw that up.  They did though.
