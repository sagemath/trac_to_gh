In operation tables like Cayley tables, there are two problems right now:

- if an element's name takes more than one line, the output looks bad.  This example was reported on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/383/badly-formatted-cayley-table):

```
sage: G=SL(2,ZZ)
sage: identity = matrix(ZZ, [[1,0], [0,1]])
sage: G.cayley_table(names='elements',elements=[identity, -identity])
```
- when producing LaTeX output, the LaTeX code for the element should be used rather than its `_repr_`.  Then matrices (for example) would work well automatically.

Yes, lets close #10786 and work on this here.

Hilarious.  Another reason not to like ask.sagemath.org.  Yes, do close #10786 as long as you feel like this one's not too big.  

Incidentally, +1 on finding a fix for arrays in the notebook!

See related #11362 which could probably be fixed in the same pass (perhaps once `MathJax` is added into the notebook).
