```
When the scipy algorithm is used to compute the Bessel I, J, Y, K function, the return value often has a small imaginary component (even though the argument is real):

```
  sage: bessel_J(5, 1.5)
  0.00179942176736061
  sage: bessel_J(5, 1.5, algorithm='scipy')
  0.00179942176736000 + 4.40731221543000e-19*I
```
This does not seem to be a problem with scipy, but is a result of the way in which scipy is called: the argument is first converted into a complex number, and then the corresponding function is called:

```
  sage: import scipy.special
  sage: scipy.special.jv(5, 1.5)
  0.0017994217673606115
  sage: scipy.special.jv(5, complex(1.5, 0.0))
  (0.0017994217673606126+4.4073122154284958e-19j)
```
One annoying consequence of this behavior is that straightforward plotting of the bessel functions becomes problematic when the scipy algorithm is used (the command below works fine when another algorithm is used): 

```
  sage: Bessel(5, typ='J', algorithm='scipy').plot(1, 10)
  verbose 0 (3989: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 200 points.
  verbose 0 (3989: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```

The present patch simply remedies this by adding a few lines to `bessel_{I, J, K, Y}` to check whether the input was real, and if so, to take the real part of the return value.  This is definitely the easiest solution, but maybe a better one exists based on how Sage calls scipy.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for spotting this omission and for uploading a new patch!  I ran `make ptestlong` on it and all tests passed correctly, and the modifications look good to me too.  So if you're willing to give the patch a positive review, I think you can go ahead and do so.  Thanks again for your time and effort.

J.

I've updated the patch.  The file `sage/functions/special.py` passes doctests, and I'm currently running `make ptestlong`.  I'm updating the status to needs_review since I don't want to give a positive review myself, but this should just be a formality.
