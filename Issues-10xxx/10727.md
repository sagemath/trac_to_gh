It's possible to plot a matrix or a 2d function in the console as a colorful map of rectangular ascii characters. The attached code by Nicolas P. Rougier does this for a numpy array. I suggest to refactor this for Sage, by introducing a plot2d_console function that either visualizes a matrix-array or a 2d function.
