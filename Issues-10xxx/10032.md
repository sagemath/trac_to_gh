This is a followup to #9746, to make the docs even better.  In addition to the things below, we should put in references like there will now be in `matrix_plot` (see #9740) to the actual function in the documentation.

In scatterplot, there is another one of those 'these are equivalent' things, but they're not separated out. Also, I get code{scatter_plot.options} instead of the actual code. Should it be show() or show()?

In sage.plot.polygon.polygon we have something similar in the examples - somehow you only got some of them. Again with the extra options guy, too.  Also, "Extra options will get passed on to show()" should have a hyperlink.

Same with the equivalent in point.py, in both point and points.

In the plot_field.py file, why did you once add the x,y variable declaration and once not? It doesn't really matter to me, but I wonder if there is something I'm missing. Again with the show() or show(), and the equivalent. It's not so important to me with the equivalent showing two things, but I feel like maybe you changed that one place - or maybe not.

In plot.py, ironically, just above the place where you fixed the 1.5/(1+e^(-x)) thing, there are a bunch of plots I didn't separate in my custom ticks patch. My apologies - but there they are! I also still get an error 'ellipsis object not callable' or something in 'add grid lines at specific positions (using lists/tuples)'. There's an ellipsis that got stuck in there still somehow - I think you got a different one of these.

In line.py, after the cool cat there are a couple things as in the previous files - one nonseparated, one equivalent issue/show() issue.

In disk.py, maybe the disk that is parallel to the xy-plane should be plotted, not just its type? Same equiv/show question.

I don't know what happened in density plot, but I think a tick is missing in the DensityPlot documentation - likely my fault? This is in 'Examples'.

In contour plot, the very last example under region_plot should have two plots, but has one. But they are different.

The circles also has the parallel to the xy-plane issue when it comes to giving the type, but not the plot.

I don't think this matters at all unless the way our documentation is generated changes, since it's just done alphabetically, right?  Or am I missing something?
