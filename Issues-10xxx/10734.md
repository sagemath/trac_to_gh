Is it just this

```
# User Gonzalo Tornaria <tornaria@cmat.edu.uy>
```
what the patches are missing?

This is a misfeature of mercurial (queues), because it doesn't set the user by default in the patches. Very silly.

Do you need me to reupload all the patches again, or can you just use

```
-u "Gonzalo Tornaria <tornaria@cmat.edu.uy>"
```
as an option when you run hg import? Reuploading 7 files to trac gets boring (is there an easier way to a batch upload to trac? from the command line?).

[as a general comment; I'd prefer if the requirements are stated in terms of what the patches need to include, rather than dictating how one must use mercurial --
I find mercurial inconvenient to use without using queues, because the history cannot be rewritten and I don't know how to effectively use branches -- I've been spoiled by git, I guess]

There's no new code at all, so I assume the positive review is still valid.
