Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A6):
> Patches should be created using `hg export tip` and not `hg diff` or any other method.  Also make sure you have a file `$HOME/.hgrc` as explained in the developer's manual.


Is it just this

```
# User Gonzalo Tornaria <tornaria@cmat.edu.uy>
```
what the patches are missing?

This is a misfeature of mercurial (queues), because it doesn't set the user by default in the patches. Very silly.

Do you need me to reupload all the patches again, or can you just use

```
-u "Gonzalo Tornaria <tornaria@cmat.edu.uy>"
```
as an option when you run hg import? Reuploading 7 files to trac gets boring (is there an easier way to a batch upload to trac? from the command line?).

[as a general comment; I'd prefer if the requirements are stated in terms of what the patches need to include, rather than dictating how one must use mercurial --
I find mercurial inconvenient to use without using queues, because the history cannot be rewritten and I don't know how to effectively use branches -- I've been spoiled by git, I guess]

I've reuploaded the two patches (hopefully) with the right format (username and date).

Also, I moved part of the referee patch in #10733 here, otherwise some doctests would fail until that ticket is merged.

There's no new code at all, so I assume the positive review is still valid.

Ticket #17837 proposes to remove `matrix_modn_dense` (it is unused since a long time and much slower than `matrix_modn_dense_float` or `matrix_modn_dense_double` using LinBox). Is there anybody working on this ticket that can say something about it? Otherwise I will put #17837 in positive review (and consequently this one in needs work).
