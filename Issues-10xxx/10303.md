There are some problems with SAGE64 and sage-check-64. First, sage-check-64 gets run whenever sage-env gets run, which is way too often. As a consequence, if SAGE64 is set, I get extra messages printed whenever I run anything like "sage -hg": 

``` 
$ sage -hg status 
Detected SAGE64 flag 
Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode 
``` 
This is annoying on its own, but it also produces incorrect information when running "sage -pkg": the extra messages make hg think that there are unchecked in changes. Also, in several files in the scripts repo, comments say that SAGE64 is only for use on OS X or Solaris, but there are no such distinctions in various spkg-install files that I've looked at: if SAGE64 is set, then it tries to build in 64-bit mode, regardless of the platform. In contrast, the file sage-check-64 only prints messages about building 64-bit if on OS X or Solaris. Finally, the script sage-check-64 creates a file SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt if SAGE64 is set to "yes", to record the fact that this is a 64-bit build. This makes sense if SAGE64 is unset, but if the user sets SAGE64 to "no", then this file should be ignored, and in fact deleted. 

The attached patch gets rid of the distinction between OS X, Solaris, and everything else. It deletes sage-64.txt if SAGE64 is "no". It also only runs sage-check-64 from sage-spkg (which is what calls spkg-install) and sage-build (which may not be strictly necessary, but it was there already). It no longer runs it from sage-env. Since it gets run by sage-spkg, it is now included in spkg/base.

I've asked some questions about this on  sage-devel. If the answers are not what I expect, then this may need to be rethought.

Follow-up ticket: #11077.

Well, not [my style](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10138#comment:9)... ;-) (which is a bit more compact)

I wonder if the sanity check on `SAGE64`'s setting should be in `sage-env`. (I assume it's still there, not visible in the patch.)

Nobody should call `sage-check-64` directly, but therefore I would
* test if `SAGE64` is either `yes`, `no` or empty **there** (otherwise one could call / source it with e.g. `SAGE64=foo`),
* make sure that `SAGE_LOCAL` is defined,
* prevent running it directly by substituting

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
   by

```sh
#!/this/file/should/be/sourced
```
   (and/or perhaps `chmod -x`).

I think we could drop "uname-specific" messages (and it's unlikely that `SAGE64` will work on 32-bit hosts).

Note that `SAGE64=yes` is (currently) not supported (or doesn't make sense) on anything but MacOS X and [Open]Solaris; this isn't clear from the `echo` in `sage-env` (which is "commented out" IIRC, but people could read it; also, *"Creating SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt since it does not exist."* might be equally confusing to people building on e.g. 32-bit Linux).

---

The name of the variable (and the "flag" file) is odd anyway (it should IMHO be `SAGE_FORCE_64BIT_BUILD`), and there's [currently] no (analogous) way to force a 32-bit build on systems that default to 64-bit...

It's still there, but it makes sense to move it to sage-check-64.

Okay, we can do these.

If SAGE64 is set to "yes", then the compiler flag "-m64" is added by certain spkgs with no check on the platform.  Is it the case this flag has no effect except on OS X and Solaris?

> The name of the variable (and the "flag" file) is odd anyway (it should IMHO be `SAGE_FORCE_64BIT_BUILD`), and there's [currently] no (analogous) way to force a 32-bit build on systems that default to 64-bit...


I don't think we can change the name of the variable, but the flag file could be renamed, since it's only used in sage-check-64.  Any suggestions?

No. I think we should check the platform once, in `sage-check-64`. While `-m64` is superfluous on systems defaulting to 64-bit builds (with `gcc`), it's illegal on typical 32-bit systems.

`SAGE64=yes` should simply only be used on 64-bit MacOS X and [Open]Solaris; we could give an error message on 32-bit systems, I think no need to give a warning on 64-bit Linuces.

Well, we could use a new variable name but keep "backwards compatibility".

`sage-build-arch.txt` (or `-abi`) is perhaps inappropriate for a file containing "yes" or "no"... ;-)

Just omit the actual filename from the message? (*"Recording build ABI..."*) At least if `SAGE64=no`?

Changing the contents of the file (e.g. "32"/"64" instead of "no"/"yes") is of course another option, but would currently only complicate the tests. (Would make sense if we introduce `SAGE_BUILD_ABI` and set `SAGE64` accordingly, or the other way around if `SAGE64` is set instead of that. Then we could rename the script to e.g. `sage-check-abi` as well...)

Here's a new version of the "v2" patch.  I haven't changed the variable or the file name, but this does check whether SAGE64 is set to anything except "no" on a non-OS X or Solaris machine, and gives an error in that case.  I'm checking the return code for sage-check-64 where it's called.

> SAGE64=yes should simply only be used on 64-bit MacOS X and [Open]Solaris; we could give an error message on 32-bit systems, I think no need to give a warning on 64-bit Linuces.


I don't know how to check for 32-bit systems in a shell script, so I'm not doing this, just checking for "Darwin" or "SunOS".

Hmmm, now we get *"32-bit build, so writing 'no' to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt."* on every non-OS X / non-[Open]Solaris system...

(And if `SAGE64` is not set, we usually read the flag file twice.)

You could check if <code>... `uname -m` in i[3456]86|ppc) ...</code>, Dave will know what in addition to look for on [Open]Solaris (e.g. "x86") and especially SPARC.

(On Darwin PPCs, `uname -m` might report more weird "processor names" like "Power Macintosh", but that's IMHO a minor issue since the build would fail later on 32-bit OSs anyway if we pass `-m64`. We do not support 64-bit builds on PowerPCs at all, so looking for `i[3456]86|ppc*|[Pp]ower*` would be ok, too.)

If you edit `sage-check-64` again, you could remove the persistent superfluous semicolon from `echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";` ;-) and replace <code>`uname`</code> by `"$UNAME"`.

Seems you really like negation... ;-) (perhaps because proofs by contradiction are usually easier?)

Looks ok to me, though still a bit complicated.

Giving an (early) error if someone tries to build a 64-bit version on a 32-bit platform is IMHO less important, and there are still ticket numbers available.

---

Regarding `uname`, unfortunately every OS implementor is free to let the `uname()` system call return whatever he/she likes (i.e. almost prose, and no official standards); I now recall Solaris returns e.g. "`i86pc`", not "`i386`" or alike, and the `uname` command just returns what it gets from that call.

For the purpose of Sage, the list of possible values shouldn't be that long though, but I'm not aware of a compilation, and just testing `uname -m` might not even be sufficient. A good resource are autotools sources (i.e. `config.guess` and `configure` scripts); our Skynet machines wiki page also contains entries for `uname -a` IIRC.

Another, safer way to detect if 64-bit builds are supported is to use `getconf`, e.g.

```sh
    if [ `getconf _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64` -eq 1 ]; then
        # 64-bit builds supported
        echo "Max. unsigned long: `getconf -v POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 ULONG_MAX`"
        # should give 2^64-1
    fi
```

I don't have a strong opinion about this, but I lean slightly toward agreeing with you.  At least allowing SAGE64=yes on any system maintains the status quo, more or less.

Do you think we should print a warning saying that it might not be fully supported, or just accept SAGE64=yes silently on platforms other than OS X and Solaris?

It's basically what in the installation guide says: 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#environment-variables says:

> Do you think we should print a warning saying that it might not be fully supported, or just accept SAGE64=yes silently on platforms other than OS X and Solaris?


I don't feel the need to print any message it's unsupported. 

Anyone using using something other than Linux, Solaris or OS X gets a message that the system in unsupported. They have to set SAGE_PORT to something non-empty. I don't feel the need to hold their hand any more.

That was just an example. I know one shouldn't test for equality (`-eq 1`), but check that the result (output) is something else than `"-1"` and `"undefined"`, but that's unrelated to its exit status.

But using `getconf` is safe and IMHO the right direction.

... where operating systems other than MacOS X, Solaris and OpenSolaris means Linux, since we currently don't support any other. And it doesn't make any sense to mess with `SAGE64` and flag files on systems not defaulting to 64-bit builds, unless or until we also support the opposite, 32-bit builds on systems that default to 64-bit.

As we support more OSs, it's trivial to add them to `sage-check-64`.

Because of its bad name, people erroneously set `SAGE64` in the past.

> Anyone using using something other than Linux, Solaris or OS X gets a message that the system in unsupported.


Which is pretty correct.

> They have to set SAGE_PORT to something non-empty. I don't feel the need to hold their hand any more. 




Btw, one can configure GCC to default to 32-bit builds on (almost) any system. (And one could configure GCC to default to 64-bit builds on e.g. Solaris as well.)

Should of course read *"on systems defaulting to 64-bit builds"* (or *"**not** defaulting to **32-bit** builds"*).

Note that there are (still) spkgs around that do more than just adding e.g. `-m64` if `SAGE64=yes`, i.e. setting it at least currently has other side effects.

So giving an error message on unexpected (and therefore unsupported) situations makes sense to me.

We could suppress such messages if `SAGE_PORT` is non-empty.

I don't know if that's intentional, but to me the "v3" is simply a regression.

* The information on `SAGE64` in `sage-env` is again misleading.

* If `SAGE64` is not set, the message when creating `sage-64.txt` is simply wrong on systems defaulting to 64-bit builds.


If `SAGE64` is not set, we still read the flag file twice if it exists (which is the usual case).

I thought I'd create a new standard package  

```
sage-4.6.1.alpha2/spkg/standard/sage_scripts-4.6.1.alpha2.spkg 
```

with the patches applied before running *make* for the first time. But that does not work, as then I get a failure as 

```
sage-4.6.1.alpha2/local/bin/sage-check-64
```

does not exist. 

If I'm not mistaken, some of the files in the sage-scripts package also need to be copied to  `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` too, which is rather confusing.They then get copied to `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` which add further to the confusion. 

Am I mistaken? 

I was hoping to test out on my laptop, which I just stuck Solaris 11 Express on it. I need to install the developers tools first on this, though a sage binary created on 'hawk' works OK. 

Perhaps you can clarify matters. By which time I should have ehough tools on here to build Sage on the laptop and test the patch more thoroughly 

BTW, I would avoid using `source` and simply replace it with a `.` - i.e. just a dot. It is more portable, and will work on shells which don't support `source`.

To my knowledge, `source` and dot are the same for **Bourne** type shells, which includes `/bin/sh` and `/bin/bash` as well as other shells like the Korn shell.

However csh and tcsh are different animals. It not really a good idea to use them for scripts - see 

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/

For interactive use, csh/tcsh have their own syntax which is quite different from sh/bash/ksh etc. 

Assuming you have forced your scripts to use bash, then using `source` is acceptable. But I think it's better to get into a habit of using more portable constructs, avoiding bashisms. 

There were (perhaps still are) some error messages generated in Sage when building on Solaris due to the use of `source`. They might have all gone now though, if a shell now uses bash rather than /bin/sh. 

Note using bash for scripts is in general not a great idea, as its size makes it slow. That's why some Linux distributions like Ubunta & Debian link /bin/sh to /bin/dash and use the lighter-weight dash shell. But if you use #!/bin/sh at the top, you need to be more careful about what you write if you want it to be portable. 

If you source a file, no matter how you do it, then if it exits you will still be back in script you sourced it from. So what you see is to be expected. 

If the script is only called from one place, you might consider just writing it inline, and not sourcing the file at all.

P.S.:

```sh

            export SAGE64=ignore

test -z "$SAGE64" && export SAGE64=no # default to no if not set

case "$SAGE64" in

        # Also make sure SAGE_LOCAL is defined if it is used; here or above.

        if [ -f "$flagfile" ]; then

Probably so, but not on this ticket :p   Does it work to set $AR or $RANLIB or many of these other variables?

I didn't see any support on sage-devel to change the status quo which allows the use of SAGE64 on any system, so I think for now, doing more documenting of what's going on is the right choice.

Well, the status quo is (or was) to **do nothing on any operating system other than MacOS X or SunOS/Solaris**. (I.e., `SAGE64` **was** effectively ignored w.r.t. `sage-env` / `sage-check-64`. The assumption in `spkg-install`s is that a non-empty `SAGE64` *implies* MacOS X or SunOS; we previously had tests like `if [ "$SAGE64" = yes -a "$UNAME" = Darwin ]`, until Dave began to port to Solaris, first *adding* a test for SunOS, then dropping the distinction on `$UNAME`, which as a side-effect then slightly changed the meaning or possible interpretations of the `spkg-install` files regarded in isolation. Of course removing the OS dependency **there** makes sense, as long as the overall meaning is kept.)

So this patch introduces quite different behavoir on the other platforms rather than just removing stupid messages (and fixing the previous ill and incomplete logic).

I moved more detailed documentation to the Installation Guide... ;-)

My version also contains lots of (brief) comments and empty lines, nevertheless fits on half a page, so is easier to read and maintain. (Dave also likes saving a few bytes.) :D

The messages are a matter of taste; perhaps we should add more `--verbose` and `--quiet` options (and/or corresponding enviro**n**ment variables) to Sage.

"Quite different" is not accurate. The only functional difference was that previously on non OS X or Solaris systems, if SAGE64=yes, then the file sage-64.txt would not be created or read.  Now it is.  Some extra messages are also printed.  (Yes, previously sage-check-64 ignored SAGE64 on Linux boxes, but many spkg-install files do not.)

And exactly *that* is the "problem", besides interpreting `SAGE64` not set as "use previous setting", which wasn't recorded on e.g. Linux.

If a user now erroneously sets `SAGE64=yes` once, potential problems persist, where previously doing `unset SAGE64` (or simply leaving / changing the shell) was sufficient. This has to be documented.

(Though it's [at least meanwhile] simply wrong what some spkgs still do when `SAGE64` is set [to "yes"], namely e.g. also modifying flags unrelated to building 32- or 64-bit. We've already removed lots of wrong *Building a 32-bit version of ...* messages.)

IMHO setting `SAGE64` (to "yes" or anything else then "no", and perhaps in the future "ignore") on e.g. Linux should raise an error, nothing else, since the behavior is - at least currently - more or less "undefined" in that case.

> Some extra messages are also printed.


I won't mind that.

> (Yes, previously sage-check-64 ignored SAGE64 on Linux boxes, but many spkg-install files do not.)


Because `SAGE64` is not expected to be set on platforms not defaulting to 32-bit builds; this should be catched in a central place, where also new OSs would and easily could be added in the first place.

Hence it should be named `SAGE_FORCE_64_BIT_BUILD`.

Note that it used to, and you're right in the sense that its *documentation* has now (actually recently) changed, but that doesn't really reflect the current situation in Sage. (It will hopefully in the future, but currently it's a "should" rather than "is", for developers rather than users.)



> so I don't see any reason it should behave any differently on different operating systems.


Its only (intended) use is to force 64-bit builds (on **operating systems** *that default to 32-bit*, and therefore doesn't make sense on others, while it should *in principle* do no harm there either, or more precisely it shouldn't have *any* effect there).

> As John said, nobody on sage-devel objected to this either.


I haven't followed that thread, but in general that doesn't mean much to me. How many people did read the thread? Two people besides you two posted; William just noted that `SAGE64` was introduced solely for MacOS X, with **no impact** on anything else. (Of course that wasn't a very good decision, since lots of code had to be changed for Solaris in essentially the same manner again.)

May I cite Peter's statement?

  ''Generically adding '-m64' when SAGE64 is set is definitely wrong because
  not all compilers will support that flag.  In addition, gcc treats x86
  and x86_64 as different variants of the one architecture - so gcc on a
  32-bit platform can compile x86_64 code.  On 32-bit x86 Linux and *BSD,
  using '-m64' will cause gcc to build x86_64 code - which the kernel won't
  be able to execute - so this is highly undesirable.''

  ''Ideally, all skpg files should inherit {C,CPP,CXX,FC,LD}FLAGS from the
  environment (adding spkg-specific options if required).  This would
  allow SAGE64 to be processed in one spot fairly early on in the build
  -- adding '-m64' or equivalent to {C,FCC,FC,LD}FLAGS, which is then
  inherited by all succeeding spkg builds.  This would remove a lot of
  special-casing from the build.''

If all spkgs really contained just what John posted,

```sh
f [ -z $CFLAG64 ] ; then
   CFLAG64=-m64
fi

if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "64 bit build of cddlib"
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $CFLAG64"; export CFLAGS
fi
```
(which definitely **isn't** the case, so also the thread didn't really address the issue), the situation would be different, and as Peter noted, we could easily move that code snippet into e.g. `sage-env`, as well as others by the way.

Other aspects we discussed here weren't discussed there at all.

## To the release manager

I wish I understood the logic of this, but it appears that 

```
sage-env
sage-make_relative
sage-spkg
```

in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` are in `.hgignore`. I'm adding a patch which adds `sage-check-64` to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/.hgignore`. After that is added, the files 

```
sage-env
sage-make_relative
sage-spkg
sage-check-64
```

should all be copied to  `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` 

At least that is my understanding of what's needed.

Changing it "needs work" instead of merging it seems like holding it up...

Sure.

> and that they fix them 


Why?  If it's trivial to fix, why does it matter who does it?  If you insist that the authors do it every time, you're adding needless bureaucracy.  If anyone notices a problem that's trivial to fix, they should just do it.  Sage is not run by the French government: it is not supposed to be governed by rigid bureaucratic rules, but instead by common sense whenever possible.

If it's the 10 hours during which a version is released, yes.  But 10 hours is just an example.

I don't have to imagine it, I've been release manager and fixed a number of issues like this (for example, commit messages without the ticket number).  I may have then posted to the ticket what the problem was, but I took care of fixing it myself.

As I said, I considered it a minor issue (and was pretty sure *you* were also aware of it), so did not even mention it.

Perhaps I should have, but it's IMHO relatively useless to upload another patch just fixing the commit message, since that usually causes more confusion. (I actually did so on other tickets, because *I knew* the author was busy / unavailable.)

If we had different access rights on trac (e.g. reviewers as "invited" co-authors with the ability to change attachments of others), that would be different.

Apparently this doesn't work with upgrades, if the flag file already exists.

I think `spkg/install` should check if one with the previous semantics (present, but usually empty => `SAGE64=yes`) exists and then write the new one, containing "yes" or "no".

`sage-env` and `sage-check-64` have to be the new versions immediately after this as well.

What's the status for this issue?

It breaks `sage -combinat install` on the OS X machine of a
colleague, precisely due to the SAGE64 verbosity effect in
`sage -hg`.

Thanks!

I'm considering reviving this ticket.  As it stands, this ticket deals with two separate issues:

- where sage-check-64 is called, where the variable $SAGE64 is set (in sage-env or sage-check-64), etc.
- what sage-check-64 actually does: which platforms are relevant, does it write anything to the file SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/sage-64.txt, etc.

The second of these is more controversial, and also more complicated, so I think it should go on a separate ticket.

Brave of you John!

I've just spent 15 minutes reading all the comments. This is another of the many tickets that gets out of hand, with a huge number of requested changes. 

> As it stands, this ticket deals with two separate issues:


They should be on separate tickets. 

It might be simpler to ask the release manager to close this ticket as "duplicate", and open two new tickets which deal with two issues in isolation. That will save there being a lot of irrelevant comments on this ticket. This has become too large for comfort.

I don't know enough about the build process of Sage, i.e. the role of all these scripts, to comment much more on this ticket. It is also dependent on #9960 which is listed as needing work. 

I'm happy to apply the patches and try some builds with and without setting SAGE64. But I'm not going to be the one to give this a positive review, as I don't understand it enough. 

I'll also take a look at #11077 and put some comments there.
