New method for permutation groups gets all the subgroups from GAP, via the conjugacy classes of subgroups.

Yes, this takes a very long time to compute and generates tons of output.  A big warning in the docstring emphasizes this.  But for small groups it is extremely instructive, well worth having, and way better than computing by hand.  I've been wanting this for about two years now.

Hi Dima,

A second thought.  I'm working with some other code for abelian groups, and there the relevant method is named just `.subgroups()`.  I like that a bit better (and easier to find on tab-completion).

What do you think of calling this by the shorter, plural version?

sounds actually better; 
one can also think of eventually having
.subgroups(order=666,abelian=true), etc, etc...

Dima,

Yes, some filters like that would be a good idea (that I had not thought of).

v2 patch simple renames the function and makes the necessary changes in the doctest.  Thanks for the extra work on this one.
