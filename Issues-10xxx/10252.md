On the Skynet machine cicero and on a 32-bit Gentoo Linux Pentium D machine of my own, the ecm package from #5847 does not install in Sage.

The problem is with Sage's `spkg-install` as the pure upstream sources in `src/` work fine.

The following works:

```
$ ./configure
$ make
```

The following (emulating `spkg-install`) does NOT work:

```
$ export CFLAGS="-g -O3 -fPIC"
$ ./configure
$ make
```

It fails with the error

```
spv.c: In function 'spv_pwmul':
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm7' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm6' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm5' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm3' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm2' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm1' in 'asm'
spv.c:157: error: unknown register name '%xmm0' in 'asm'
```

It doesn't actually matter what CFLAGS is set to, it fails even with

```
$ export CFLAGS=" "
```

This is probably because Sage's CFLAGS overrides ecm's CFLAGS.  I think the easiest solution is simply not set any CFLAGS in ecm's `spkg-install`.  Since ecm really wants to optimize for a particular machine, I think the fact that ecm's CFLAGS are not used has also bad consequences for speed.

Actually an upstream bug... (And not setting `CFLAGS` or `CC` is not an option. There are different ways to let the compiler produce processor-specific optimized code. Note that this anyway doesn't affect optimized assembly code, which ECM also comes with.)

note that GMP-ECM uses CC and CFLAGS from GMP, which ensures both portability and performance.
Thus overriding the choice of CFLAGS by GMP-ECM is a bad idea.

What does `grep CFLAGS gmp.h` give on that machine?

On my machine (32-bit Gentoo Linux Pentium D), I get with the mpir header installed by Sage:

```
#define `__GMP_`CFLAGS "-g -O3 "
#define `__MPIR_`CFLAGS "-g -O3 "
```

With the system-wide `/usr/include/gmp.h`, I get

```
#define `__GMP_`CFLAGS "-pipe -march=nocona -O2 -mfpmath=sse"
```

the spkg should work with the system-wide CFLAGS value. With `-g -O3` it seems `HAVE_SSE2` is defined but SSE2 is not supported.

What is strange is that the GMP-ECM configure checks if SSE2 is really supported,
and if it is not the SSE2 code should not be compiled.

Do you confirm that the upstream package works with `CFLAGS=-g -O3`?

with Pierrick Gaudry, we have analyzed and fixed the problem.

Long story: the asm volatile instructions without constraints in the configure script compile fine without -msse2, but those from the `spv.c` file, which have constraints, do not compile
without -msse2. The fix was to put instructions with constraints in configure.

Short story: apply the following patch

I can imagine that this bug-fix will make the ecm package work, but I believe that the deeper issue in Sage still needs to be addressed: namely that `spkg-install` (both for mpir and for ecm) is providing CFLAGS when it should leave that to the packages themselves.

For example, on sage.math.washington.edu, the upstream mpir package uses the flags `-O2 -m64 -march=core2 -mtune=core2` (i.e.: optimized for the particular machine) while within Sage, the flags `-g -O3` are used.

I consider such *upstream* issues, i.e., upstream should IMHO **"modify"** `CFLAGS` et al. if appropriate or necessary, rather than either ignoring them or (solely) using user-specified settings "as is".

(Try e.g. `env CFLAGS="" ./sage -ba-force && ./sage -c "quit"`... which *breaks* the Cython-generated C code, or at least used to do so.)

Yes, but not (necessarily) exclusively. ;-)

(Almost all build scripts append or prepend to `CFLAGS` etc., which is convenient if one only wants to add e.g. "`-g`", "`-march=native`" or "`-mcpu=i486`". Here we want the former...)

So we at least still have the problem of adding `-m64` if `SAGE64=yes` (i.e., if we want a 64-bit build on systems that default to 32-bit builds):

```sh
...
# Note that GMP-ECM is written in C (and assembler) - no C++ sources.

if [ "$SAGE64" = yes ]; then
    echo "Building a 64-bit version of GMP-ECM"
    if [ -z "$CFLAG64" ]; then
        CFLAG64=-m64
    fi
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $CFLAG64 -fPIC"
    LDFLAGS="$CFLAG64"; export LDFLAGS
else
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC"
fi

# We add debug symbols by default;
if [ "$SAGE_DEBUG" = yes ]; then
    # Disable optimization:
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -O0"
else
    # Enable optimization, may be overridden by user settings:
    CFLAGS="-g -O3 $CFLAGS"
fi

export CFLAGS # usually redundant, but safe(r)
...
```

Of course I could add "our" (or worse, also *any user-specified*) `CFLAGS` to `CC`, i.e. the C compiler command, and `unset CFLAGS` to make ECM's effective, but I wouldn't like that. (And some settings then would get overridden by ECM's `CFLAGS` anyway.)

---

An IMHO better solution is to also add `-march=native` to `CFLAGS`, since this enables SSE (to be precise, allows SSE2 instructions) if supported by the processor (when `configure` defines `HAVE_SSE2`), ignoring `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` at least for the moment (unless ECM's `configure` has an option like `--disable-sse` or similar; I haven't really checked that yet, perhaps just `--enable-sse2=no` on *32-bit* x86).




I'm not sure what happens if we configure with `CFLAGS` set and `--enable-gmp-cflags=no` (which seems to be more appropriate when using ECM with MPIR).

not sure. GMP uses 64-bit words if available (even if the system is 32 bit), and GMP-ECM uses
GMP CFLAGS.

You know that -march=native is only supported on x86 and amd64 cpus right?
I can tell you first hand that the compilation will stop straight away on ppc.
And then you will get Dave telling you it is not supported by other compilers.

I was not going to try to enable SSE2 on PowerPCs (nor SPARC processors). ;-)

There's very little support for other compilers in Sage, and it's easy to add a distinction when the day it gets necessary comes, though I could add it now.

for your information, this bug is fixed upstream, but we have no new release yet. The fix
consists in adding -msse2 when required to compile the corresponding assembly files.
See around lines 297-326 of the configure.in file in the svn version upstream.
