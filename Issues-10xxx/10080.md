In this file, there are a lot of places where, in the html documentation, one sees `TEST` areas that aren't highlighted, methods like `simplify_log` referred to but not hyperlinked via `:meth:` (in one case, somehow it is only `meth:` by mistake), and so forth.  I won't be more specific because it's throughout the file - you just have to look.  For instance, in a number of places there is something like 

```
TESTS::
     sage: asf;dlkj
```
but since there isn't an intervening empty line this is typeset wrong.

Hey,

Many of the things that were there before were correct (see [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html:)). However the biggest thing to strive for (in a file) is consistency. For example, every occurrence of `True` should be typeset as <code>\`\`True\`\`</code> and every trac reference should be of the form <code>:trac:\`10080\`</code>. (Of course there are some exceptions to this "rule", but the reasoning should be clear and self-evident.) However this does clean up a fair amount and is a good first attempt.

Also, is your patch suppose to be the only patch applied or on top of Kenneth's patch?

Thanks,

Travis

For example, the `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` blocks should be:

```
INPUT:

- ``arg_name`` -- Description of argument

- ``second_arg`` -- Another description

OUTPUT:

Describing the output
```
Also, for multi-line doctests, it is just `...`, not `....:` (don't ask me why), I prefer `EXAMPLES:` (with the s no matter if it is 1 or many), and capitalized `.. SEEALSO::` and such blocks. A good check is to run `sage -docbuild reference html` (after rebuilding sage via `sage -b`) and look at the output in `.../sage-branch/doc/output/html/...` in your favorite web-browser (Firefox had some issues last I knew, this might have been fixed...).

For patchbot:

Apply only: trac_10080_docstrings_edit.patch

Hah! I have found one last glitch just now, which I do not how to fix: 

```
x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature
```

and

```
x.next() -> the next value, or raise StopIteration
```

which appear in the `ExpressionIterator` class, towards the end of the built html. 

I don't know how to fix this.
