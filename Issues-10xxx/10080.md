In this file, there are a lot of places where, in the html documentation, one sees `TEST` areas that aren't highlighted, methods like `simplify_log` referred to but not hyperlinked via `:meth:` (in one case, somehow it is only `meth:` by mistake), and so forth.  I won't be more specific because it's throughout the file - you just have to look.  For instance, in a number of places there is something like 

```
TESTS::
     sage: asf;dlkj
```
but since there isn't an intervening empty line this is typeset wrong.

Hey,

Many of the things that were there before were correct (see [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html:)). However the biggest thing to strive for (in a file) is consistency. For example, every occurrence of `True` should be typeset as <code>\`\`True\`\`</code> and every trac reference should be of the form <code>:trac:\`10080\`</code>. (Of course there are some exceptions to this "rule", but the reasoning should be clear and self-evident.) However this does clean up a fair amount and is a good first attempt.

Also, is your patch suppose to be the only patch applied or on top of Kenneth's patch?

Thanks,

Travis

For example, the `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` blocks should be:

```
INPUT:

- ``arg_name`` -- Description of argument

- ``second_arg`` -- Another description

OUTPUT:

Describing the output
```
Also, for multi-line doctests, it is just `...`, not `....:` (don't ask me why), I prefer `EXAMPLES:` (with the s no matter if it is 1 or many), and capitalized `.. SEEALSO::` and such blocks. A good check is to run `sage -docbuild reference html` (after rebuilding sage via `sage -b`) and look at the output in `.../sage-branch/doc/output/html/...` in your favorite web-browser (Firefox had some issues last I knew, this might have been fixed...).

2. Secondly, on the devel mailing list, I have seen that Keshav Kini was saying that it is better to have `....:` instead of `...` (there is a also a ticket on trac: #10458). So, I am now lost. 

3. About, EXAMPLES, I'd go ahead and change.  Capitalisation shall also be done. 

>A good check is to run `sage -docbuild reference html` (after rebuilding sage via `sage -b`) and look at the output in `.../sage-branch/doc/output/html/...` in your favorite web-browser (Firefox had some issues last I knew, this might have been fixed...).


Sure thing. Being a newbie that I am, my eyes are not trained enough to catch oddities. ;-) 

Thank you for all the comments. I'll submit a patch to be applied on top of this. Thank you.

You'll notice that the ticket is not yet into sage (its status would be "closed" if it was), so those doctests will currently fail (you can run `sage -t filename1 filename2 ...` from the terminal).
