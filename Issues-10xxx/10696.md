The following doesn't seem right to me.  I tried this on sage 4.5.3 and 4.6.  My impression is that the SymmetricGroup function can take a list of distinct integers X as an argument and give the symmetric group S_X.  However, we can try the following.

```
sage: f=SymmetricGroup([1,2,4]) 
sage: for i in f: 
....:     print i
....:
() 
(2,3) 
(1,2) 
(1,2,3) 
(1,3,2) 
(1,3) 
sage: f[3] 
(1,2,3) 
sage: f[3](4) 
4 
sage: f[3](3) 
1 
sage: f.set() 
(1, 2, 4)
```

Thus, it seems that f.set() returns the right support, but in fact the support for the group is 1,2,3.  This suggests to me that S_X = S_{1,2,3}.
