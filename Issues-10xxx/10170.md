For large n values use the formula: `bell(n) = exp(-1)*sum(k=0, infinity, k**n/k!)`

Currently my code beats all known implementations, also sage's code which wraps GAP's Bell is slow and using lots of memory, and unable to compute bell_number(n) if n is large.

Some timings on Amd 2.1 GHz:

n       time (Wall time)

300     0.01 sec.

1000    0.03 sec.

3000    0.18 sec.

10000   2.88 sec.

30000   46.79 sec.

100000  819.37 sec.

Compare these with another programs:
http://fredrik-j.blogspot.com/2009/03/computing-generalized-bell-numbers.html

Also exposes mpmath's `bell()` as an alternative algorithm.

Hello and thanks for the patch!  I'm curious, have you compared your solution with wrapping mpmath directly?  For example,

``` 
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.bell?
```

Also, this ticket is basically a dup of #7812, so one of these (maybe that one, since this has a patch) should be closed.  

Finally, don't forget to set the status as 'needs_review' once you've added a patch!

Thanks,
Jason

Yes, but times are not saved I will rerun them: here are the timings for mpmath:

n  time (Wall time)

300 0.02 sec.

1000 0.06 sec.

3000 0.41 sec.

10000 10.26 sec.

30000 168.27 sec.

100000 (still computing)

So here mpmath is about 2-4 times slower, and seems that using more memory than my code.

That is not true, in fact: E_2=exp(-1)*E_1 as you can read in my original bell_proof.txt

About exponential numbers: that is a different problem. Here we compute only a single Bell number not the first n Bell numbers and there the algorithm is optimal (O(n*n) time), the same question for Bell numbers is an open problem.
