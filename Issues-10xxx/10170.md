```
For large n values use the formula: `bell(n) = exp(-1)*sum(k=0, infinity, k**n/k!)`

Currently my code beats all known implementations, also sage's code which wraps GAP's Bell is slow and using lots of memory, and unable to compute bell_number(n) if n is large.

Some timings on Amd 2.1 GHz:

n       time (Wall time)

300     0.01 sec.

1000    0.03 sec.

3000    0.18 sec.

10000   2.88 sec.

30000   46.79 sec.

100000  819.37 sec.

Compare these with another programs:
http://fredrik-j.blogspot.com/2009/03/computing-generalized-bell-numbers.html

Also exposes mpmath's `bell()` as an alternative algorithm.

Hello and thanks for the patch!  I'm curious, have you compared your solution with wrapping mpmath directly?  For example,

``` 
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.bell?
```

Also, this ticket is basically a dup of #7812, so one of these (maybe that one, since this has a patch) should be closed.  

Finally, don't forget to set the status as 'needs_review' once you've added a patch!

Thanks,
Jason

Yes, but times are not saved I will rerun them: here are the timings for mpmath:

n  time (Wall time)

300 0.02 sec.

1000 0.06 sec.

3000 0.41 sec.

10000 10.26 sec.

30000 168.27 sec.

100000 (still computing)

So here mpmath is about 2-4 times slower, and seems that using more memory than my code.

From my 10 minutes of googling, no, it should not be. The exponential numbers seem to be a generalization of the Bell numbers and I don't know that this implementation can be generalized to that (and hence go into that module). My guess is that it's probably yes, but I'll leave that to someone with more expertise to answer.
