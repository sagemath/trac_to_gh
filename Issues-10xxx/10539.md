<div id="comment:0"></div>

The `sage0` interface doesn't always return exactly the same thing.
At #10528 the apparent problem is solved by making the doctests less rigid.  But the real problem is not fixed there. With the real problem being that the piece of code:

```
sage: sage0.clear('x')
sage: sage0.get('x')
```
returns

```
"...NameError: name 'x' is not defined" 
```
in some setups and

```
'...NameError: name \'x\' is not defined'
```
in other setups.
