We try to keep lines short (more or less 80 characters) in documentation so they can be read nicely in terminals.  So you should put 

```
or :func:`~sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` 
``` 
on a new line.

Also, you'll need a period at the end of the sentence at the beginning.

Otherwise seems like it should work fine!

[PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) suggests 72 characters for documentation, 79 for code (and presumably doctests).
