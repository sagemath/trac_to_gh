For instance,

We try to keep lines short (more or less 80 characters) in documentation so they can be read nicely in terminals.  So you should put 

```
or :func:`~sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.polygon3d` 
``` 
on a new line.

Also, you'll need a period at the end of the sentence at the beginning.

Otherwise seems like it should work fine!
