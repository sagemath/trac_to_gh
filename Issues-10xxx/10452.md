The command "reduce_cusp" seems to be a bit flaky -- here are two perfectly standard inputs that cause it to fail in different ways: 

```
sage: G = Gamma1(5); G
Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(5)
sage: G.reduce_cusp(1/2) # works
1/2
sage: G.reduce_cusp(3) # boom (1)

```

In each case ` G.reduce_cusp(Cusp(...)) ` gives the right answer, so the problem is apparently that various code expects the input to be a Cusp object and raises problems when it isn't.
