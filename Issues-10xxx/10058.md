Sage crashes when asked to do a backward or inverse FFT for sizes that are powers of two:

```
sage: a = FFT(5)
sage: a[1] = 2
sage: a.forward_transform()
sage: a.backward_transform()
sage: a = FFT(4)
sage: a[1] = 2
sage: a.forward_transform()
sage: a.backward_transform()


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
This is with 4.6.alpha2.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This happens with `a.inverse_transform()`, too.  From near the end of `sage/gsl/fft.pyx`:

```python
    def backward_transform(self):
        cdef gsl_fft_complex_wavetable * wt
        cdef gsl_fft_complex_workspace * mem
        N = Integer(self.n)
        e = N.exact_log(2)
        if N==2**e:
            gsl_fft_complex_backward(self.data, self.stride, self.n, wt, mem)
```
Should this be

```python
            gsl_fft_complex_radix2_backward(self.data, self.stride, self.n)
```
(and similarly for `inverse_transform`)?

```python
        if N!=2**e:
            mem = gsl_fft_complex_workspace_alloc(self.n)
            wt = gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_alloc(self.n)
            gsl_fft_complex_backward(self.data, self.stride, self.n, wt, mem)
            gsl_fft_complex_workspace_free(mem)
            gsl_fft_complex_wavetable_free(wt)
```

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
Hello! The patches look good. I have the following comments about the doc patch.

1. Can you fix the documentation of the functions? It should be like this

```
def function(n, p=1):
    """
    Determine the ``n``-th number. Note that I didn't use `n`
    since single backticks will format it in latex.
   
    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- Integer. Description of this parameter

    - ``p`` -- Integer (default: 1). Description of this parameter.
```

2. The following line <code>180	        See \`self.plot\` for details. </code> should use `:meth:` to refer to plot. Also, <code>\`self.plot\`</code> is used in some other functions.

```
See :meth:`.plot` for details.
```

3. `pi` should also be changed to float in this line

```
191	        pi    = sage.symbolic.constants.pi   # should append .n() at the end.
```

4. In the function `plot`, the INPUT needs a fix. It should be like this. Also, see 1. for the comment about default values and formatting.

```
- ``style`` -- Style of the plot, options are ``"rect"`` or ``"polar"``
```

You can refer to the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings) for more information about the formatting of docstrings.

*EDIT*: Some formatting fixes.

Looks good to me. It applies fine to sage-6.1 and `sage/gsl` passes all doctests.

On a sidenote, I don't even remember having made those comments earlier. In reply to my comments @lftabera updated a new patch but I never got any email because adding attachments do not generate emails!

*In short*: add a comment after adding or updating a git branch; otherwise we don't get email notifications!
