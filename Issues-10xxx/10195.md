I ran

./sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx"

1000 times in serial [1] with a 64-bit 4.6.rc0 built on OS X 10.6
(bsd.math).  All but one of the runs pass.  The failure:

```

The error also occurs with a 32-bit build on bsd.math (OS X 10.6, 5 out of 1000 runs) and on sage.math (64-bit Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS, 6 of 1000 runs).

David Kirkby does **not** get any incorrect results on OpenSolaris 06/2009 after more than 15000 runs with 4.6.rc0 and more than 16000 with 4.6.1.alpha0. He had a total of 31748 passes. However, he did experience 109 doctest failures which are likely to be result of doctesting two copies of Sage simultaneously, as these were using the same directory for temporary files (`$HOME/.sage/tmp`). His errors were like  this:

```

        [0.2 s]
```

and never due to False being return instead of True. His problems are probably the result of the issues discussed on #9739. Once David only tested one copy of Sage at a time, there were 0 failures in 17230 tests of sage-4.6.rc0. (Note, since Sage currently only works well on Solaris or OpenSolaris if built as a 32-bit application, this was a 32-bit build).

What if those failures are *intended* by the fplll authors, but just do *not* work on *your* machine / operating system? Or just those "file not found" instances would have been the ones failing... Nobody knows. ;-)

(At least regarding memory and CPUs, I trust most of my machines; they didn't show any bit errors I certainly would have noticed for at least month of continuous computations whose results I could verify...)

Btw, one could also try something like

```sh
$ export SAGE_TEST_GLOBAL_ITER=1000
$ ./sage -tp 1 -long devel/sage/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx 2>&1 | tee fplll-test.log
$ echo "`grep -c All fplll-test.log` out of 1000 runs did NOT fail."
$ echo "`grep -c Got fplll-test.log` tests out of 1000 gave an unexpected result."
```

I was rather expecting you to have something to say on this;-) 

FWIW, I'm now doctesting again, but this time only testing one instance of Sage. So errors due to using the one directory for temp files should not exist. I've only managed to run the tests 3723 times, but none of them have failed in any way whatsoever. 

I personally think my initial failures were due to #9739. 

I think the matrix used for this test might be random, which could explain failures which occur when (for example) all elements are zero. However, that would probably not explain why I don't get any failures.

```python

        failed += [ i ]
        print "Test #%d failed:" % i
        if verbose:

At least recompilation of libfplll and `sage/libs/fplll/*` with `-mfpmath=387` on the (32-bit) Pentium 4 Prescott doesn't change the outcome (on which I usually compile with `-mfpmath=sse`).

Wow, that's more then I get. (I did a couple of tests on three machines, with 100,000 and 1,000,000 "runs"; the failure rate in comparison to the doctests dropped to about 0.15-0.17%.)

I've also rebuilt rc0 from scratch with `SAGE87=yes` on x86_64, and besides 7 new doctest errors, three of them PARI "bugs", one numerical noise, the failures remain; approximately same ratio with the Python program.

By the way, these failures are deterministic, so there's no need to do extensive loops.

One example that fails in pari/gp 2.4.3 (in sage), but works with pari/gp 2.3.1:

```
mathnf([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 23, 6; \

```

I'll investigate some more, and then report this upstream.
