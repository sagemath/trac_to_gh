After updating ATLAS (#10508), cvxopt fails with

```
sage: from cvxopt import lapack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/vbraun/opt/sage-4.6.1.alpha3-atlas/<ipython console> in <module>()

ImportError: /home/vbraun/opt/sage-4.6.1.alpha3-atlas/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cvxopt/lapack.so: undefined symbol: ilaenv_
```

I've looked into the cvxopt spkg and its `lapack.so` uses the Fortran blas  function `ilaenv` without linking to f77blas. Adding f77blas to the libraries in `setup.py` fixes the undefined symbol error.

Attached is a patch against `patch/setup.py` to add the extra library.

Volker, what platform do you get it on?
I cannot reproduce it on Linux x86-64 Debian...
Could it be an Altas hack done wrongly?

Hmm, how did cvxopt manage this? I'd rather think that something got changed in Atlas - IMHO Atlas 3.8 used to provide a complete wrapper to La@ack...

Actually, on some platforms, e.g. OSX PPC, f77blas does not even exist.
On this platform, Atlas is not installed. So your patch will break this, for sure.

Atlas-3.8.3 does only provide a static lapack library, so cvxopt's `lapack.so` statically linked it all:

Atlas-3.9.32 builds shared libraries and cvxopt now links against the shared library.

In particular, ilaenv remains UNDefined in cvxopt `lapack.so` and atlas `liblapack.so` and needs to be dynamically linked in from `libf77blas.so`.

I guess we should keep statically linking the static system-provided lapack on Windows and OSX, or change cvxopt to use the C version clapack_ilaenv (since it already links to `libcblas.so`)

If you tell me exactly what to do and provide and spkg or two, sure.  I know I won't have time while at work to make a new spkg etc.   May need to wait until Thursday.  

Will this potentially impact Cygwin as well?  Just curious.

No, 10508 updates Atlas, but on OSX we don't use Atlas at all?!
Well, perhaps I was missing something: then you should start with the ticket 10508 depends on, then 10508 itself,
and only then this one.

Correct, we don't.  What ticket does #10508 depend on?  I don't see a list.

Do we have to link to cblas instead of blas?  I realize this is pretty naive, but I don't know whether that exists on Mac (yet).  We would have to make it, maybe?  See [this ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/453/linking-to-atlasblas-in-cython) question.

`cblas` exists on Mac OSX in disguise. The equivalent of `-lcblas` in compiler/linker options is `-framework Accelerate`.
Although I have no idea how setup.py has to be modified to accommodate this.

Apparently.  At any rate

```
find . -name "*blas.dylib" -print
```
in the home directory on my PPC box yields only the library mentioned above and `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/lib/libRblas.dylib`.  So I guess this is ok, if perhaps "frickin' slow", according to an old linbox spkg-install.
