This gives a legend:

```
plot(x,legend_label='test')+plot(x^2,legend_label='test')
```

but this doesn't:

```
plot([x,x^2], legend_label='test')
```

I'm adding a doctest for people to *see* this as well in the live documentation.  

Why the extra blank lines?

Also, note that even this didn't work before.

```
sage: q1 = plot([sin(x)], legend_label='trig'); q1
```
which I assume why you did the test you did.

Reviewer patch coming up.

Am I the only one who finds it funny that a patch described as "be less aggressive about pruning legend labels" conflicts with a patch called "be more aggressive about pruning legend labels"?

I'll try letting #10514 take priority and modify #11998 to deal with it.
