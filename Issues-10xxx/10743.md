Experience teaches that EclObjects wrapping LISP lists would often be convenient to iterate over in list comprehensions and for loops. Pythonizing the EclObject would work recursively, which is often not what is required: you just want to work with EclObjects wrapping the members of the list. The iterator protocol seems to yield a convenient and well-defined interface. Examples:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: [i for i in EclObject("(1 2 3)")]
[<ECL: 1>, <ECL: 2>, <ECL: 3>]
sage: [i for i in EclObject("(1 2 . 3)")]
[<ECL: 1>, <ECL: 2>, <ECL: 3>]
sage: [i for i in EclObject("NIL")]
[]
sage: [i for i in EclObject("T")]
Traceback (most recent call last):

It does apply cleanly to 4.6.1 and the patchbot was happy with the patch too (although the patchbot seems to be down at the moment)

The patch applied cleanly on 4.6.2alpha4.

I got one minor doctest failure running "make ptest" (I'm using the new ECL 11.1 and Maxima 5.23 packages, maybe something changed with the new ECL):

You should probably be aware of #10766 (an update of ECL), which has positive review. Also perhaps #10773 (an update of Maxima) which also has positive review.

I have been on this one and the maxima as ecl lib for a while Dave.
They apply cleanly against #10766 and #10773. I imagine other people on these bugs are getting sick of the reminders.

Somewhat surprisingly, I could understand all of this code, and it makes perfect sense.  Tests work out fine, obviously, though I don't know if any edge cases have been tried, since I am not sure what the edge cases would be. My guess is that this is used fairly heavily in #7377, is that correct?  

My only request is that there might be a doctest to show the list and tuples working directly, like so:

```
sage: [i for i in EclObject([1,2,3])]
[<ECL: 1>, <ECL: 2>, <ECL: 3>]
sage: [i for i in EclObject((1,2,3))]
[<ECL: 1>, <ECL: 2>, <ECL: 3>]
```
I realize that combining the doctests from EclObject and this module amount to the same thing, but it would be very helpful for someone wanting to understand the Ecl interface better.  

I'm going to attach a reviewer patch for this, with the understanding that if for some reason this causes #7377 patches to not apply correctly, the positive review for the current patch would remain (and I'd open a separate ticket for this).
