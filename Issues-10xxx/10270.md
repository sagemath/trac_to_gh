the documentation of `proof.polynomial` says:

```
If t == False, allows polynomial algorithms to (by
default) return results that may depend on unproven conjectures
or on probabilistic algorithms.
```
However this does not work with the `factor` function:

```
sage: proof.polynomial(False)
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(3)[]
sage: (x^2*z^2+x*y*z-y^2).factor()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
```

great! All tests pass. A minor request before giving a positive review: is it possible to add a test
checking that the factorization works with `proof=False`, and fails with `proof=True`?
