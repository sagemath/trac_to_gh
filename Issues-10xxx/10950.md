The current hash function for generic dense matrices suffers from hard collisions with permutation matrices. For example: all permutation matrices of size 4 have hash 0!

```
    sage: def mat(p): m = p.to_matrix(); m.set_immutable(); return m
    sage: [ hash(mat(p)) for p in Permutations(4) ]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

I stumbled on this when profiling some code using Weyl groups that
heavily used caching (the hash of a weyl group element is the hash of the underlying matrix). I gained a speed factor of 10x by just tweaking the hash of matrices.

Cheers,
				Nicolas


After applying this branch:

```
sage: def hashmat(p): m = p.to_matrix(); m.set_immutable(); return hash(m)
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(1)))
1
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(2)))
2
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(3)))
6
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(4)))
24
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(5)))
120
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(6)))
720
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(7)))
5040
sage: len(set(hashmat(p) for p in Permutations(8)))
40320
```

As extra bonus, this branch ensures that scalar matrices have the same hash as the scalar. This means one extra case where `A == B` implies `hash(A) == hash(B)`.

For polynomials this is exactly the same setting with the list `(exponent, coefficient)`. See #21284.

The question: for sparse matrices (respectively sparse or multivariate polynomials), would it be reasonable to sort the indices in the hash function?

I don't see how, but maybe I don't understand what you think it will be less robust with respect to.

> and, more importantly, would be very hard to optimize in specialized classes.


I don't see why you would need to optimize the hash function. The bottleneck would be iterating over the non-zero values, which is (would be?) a separate method.

> You don't want the construction of a frozenset each time `__hash__` is called (eg for dense matrices or univariate polynomial the list of exponents naturally come in order).


Do you really want to sort a list of triples every time for sparse matrices? Inserting n objects into a hash table is much faster than that: O(n) vs O(n log n) for sorting them. We might want to consider (continuing) to cache the `__hash__` as well.

I also don't see why polynomials should come into an argument here.

However, here is another thought for a hash function:

```python
temp = [0,0,0]
for i,j in self.nonzero_positions():
    temp[0] += i
    temp[1] += j
    temp[2] += self[i,j]
return hash(tuple(temp))
```

<a id='comment:12'></a>First of all, the hash function is time critical and caching a hash is useless. You are almost never trying to test `A = A` (are you?). At least, upstream Python decided not to cache it for tuples and frozensets based on concrete benchmarking.

Let me consider a first concrete situation. I have 2 invertible matrices 3x3 matrices and I want to check whether there is a multiplicative relation among them. It is likely that I need to consider products of size 20, that is put in a set around 3<sup>20</sup> matrices. Building a frozenset for each of them would be a considerable waste and caching would not help.

A situation for which caching might be useful is when you have a "combinatorial" free module with a basis made of matrices and you encode your vectors using your matrices as keys. Though, that might be a problem of datastructure here (the keys are completely static).

Do you have more concrete situations where hashing is involved?

For sorting the indices, I believe that in most situations hashing will be used on dense matrices. For them, you can go through the `(i,j)` indices in any order you like.

Concerning collisions, I don't believe your hash function was a serious proposal. Let us consider `n x n` matrices with entries `{0,1}`. Let N = n<sup>2</sup>. You know that you have 2<sup>N</sup> such matrices and it is easy to see that you have a polynomial number of values produced by your hash function (around N<sup>2</sup> N<sup>2</sup> N = N<sup>5</sup> if I am optimistic). Even on permutation matrices, your hash function would perform terribly.

The relevance of polynomials is that you have the same kind of troubles passing from univariate (coefficients in a list like structure) to multivariate (coefficients in a dictionary like structure). See #21284.

Interesting. This is how Python implements hashing for tuples:

```
sage: def tuplehash(t):
....:     n = len(t)
....:     x = 3430008
....:     for i in range(n):
....:         h = hash(t[i])
....:         x = (x ^^ h) * (1000003 + (82520 + 2*n)*i)
....:     return x + 97531
```
The resulting value should be reduced mod 2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> depending on the system.

The reason for the collision is that `N ^^ -2 == -N` for any odd `N`. The choice of a XOR operation there is strange, since most simple hash functions would use addition instead. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Constructions for example.

I like the idea but not the concrete implementation. It does avoid sorting but there needs to be more mixing. Something like

```python
h = 0
for i,j in self.nonzero_positions():
    h += H(i, j, self[i,j])
return h
```
where `H` is a simple hash function.

It depends on what you mean by "considerable waste." In terms of computational complexity, it just adds to the constant (or probably would not even be contributing asymptotically for dense matrices). However, I do agree that it effectively doubles the memory footprint for dense matrices.

As you mentioned, when they are used for keys of a module implemented as a `dict`, such for `CombinatorialFreeModule` elements, or for defining objects such as `FiniteDimensionalAlgebra`. Granted, in these situations the matrices are relatively small.

I have been doing a bunch of stuff with sparse matrices recently (computing representations of Lie algebras) and have encountered things that are optimized for dense matrices that are used by sparse matrices as well. So I'd appreciate it if we didn't make the hash worse for sparse matrices just because it is better of dense matrices.

> Concerning collisions, I don't believe your hash function was a serious proposal.


It was just a thought on how to remove the dependence on the order and not fully fleshed out. I know I'm less experienced in this area, but I am legitimately trying to help.

> Let us consider `n x n` matrices with entries `{0,1}`. Let N = n<sup>2</sup>. You know that you have 2<sup>N</sup> such matrices and it is easy to see that you have a polynomial number of values produced by your hash function (around N<sup>2</sup> N<sup>2</sup> N = N<sup>5</sup> if I am optimistic). Even on permutation matrices, your hash function would perform terribly.


I agree that it would not perform well in this case. What do you think about Jeoren's modification. I think it works well for both dense and sparse matrices and should work better than my proposal.

> The relevance of polynomials is that you have the same kind of troubles passing from univariate (coefficients in a list like structure) to multivariate (coefficients in a dictionary like structure). See #21284.


For the multivariate polynomials, it looks like what is used is Jeroen's proposal. Although we could have a completely different solution for polynomials because the data structure for dense univariate is 1D and sparse k-variate are kD, whereas matrices are strictly 2D.

It would not be forced: `return hash(self._get_unsafe(i,j))` is a reasonable default.

This hash function is a lot better than the old one. However, it is far from perfect:

```
sage: M = diagonal_matrix([0, 1, -2, 1]); M.set_immutable(); hash(M)
0
```
Still, it is the best hash that I could come up with which is very efficient for sparse matrices: it takes time `O(s)` with `s` the number of non-zero entries of a matrix (independent of the size of the matrix). If you are willing to sort the indices (as suggested in [comment:7]), you get a better hash but with a runtime of `O(s log(s))`.
