David, I'm not sure the proposed patch is optimal. Indeed, the problem only occurs when self
is a small integer and other is a GMP integer. Since the small integer code seems to deal
correctly with mod(0,1), a fix is only needed is the case self=mod(0,1) and other is a GMP
integer, for example after the line

```
        if other.modulus() == 1:
            return self
```
Robert, since you wrote this code, can you comment on this?
