Excellent work.  I'll need some time to go through the Tate and Ate pairing code; if no-one gets to it first this is something to do at SD29 in 10 days' time.

Until then, just two comments:  

1. You use the hasse_bounds function in the opint order-setting function, but why not also in the groupcorder setting function?

2. Amusing fact:  for fields of size at least 32 there cannot be two integers in the Hasse interval with one dividing the other (since the ratio of the upper and lower bounds is < 2)!

Whereas without the timing everthing is fine:

```

p = 103; A = 1; B = 18; E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [A, B])
P = E(33, 91); n = P.order()
k = GF(n)(p).multiplicative_order()
P.tate_pairing(P, n, k)
1

Ok, I can be more specific in what the error is.  In tate_pairing (P.tate_pairing(Q,n,k)), if P._miller_(Q, n) raises a 
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist., then it creates a random point R and then calles P.tate_pairing(Q+R,n,k).  
If Q+R is zero, then P._miller_(Q+R,n,k) raises an error.  This is not checked for and it seems that given certain 
random seeds this does occur.

```

p = 103; A = 1; B = 18; E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [A, B])
P = E(33, 91); n = P.order()
k = GF(n)(p).multiplicative_order()
set_random_seed(15)
P.tate_pairing(P,n,k)
