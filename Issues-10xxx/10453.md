```
Weird things happen if you try to compute the old submodule of a Gamma1 modular forms space. E.g.

```
sage: CuspForms(Gamma1(11), 2).old_submodule() # crashes
```

This turns out to be because:

```
sage: ModularForms(Gamma1(11), 2).hecke_module_of_level(1).hecke_module_of_level(11)
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```

so the degeneracy level-raising map is getting computed for the wrong space!

Prerequisite for #11601. (Note that #11601 depends on a bunch of other stuff as well, but this ticket is independent of any of the other patches in the series.)

Here's a patch. It requires #8716 (but is independent of either #10450 or #10452). The fix was to make the various degeneracy matrix commands pass around an explicit target space, rather than just a target level, as the argument.
