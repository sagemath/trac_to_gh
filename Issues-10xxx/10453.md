```
Weird things happen if you try to compute the old submodule of a Gamma1 modular forms space. E.g.

```
sage: CuspForms(Gamma1(11), 2).old_submodule() # crashes
```

This turns out to be because:

```
sage: ModularForms(Gamma1(11), 2).hecke_module_of_level(1).hecke_module_of_level(11)
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```

so the degeneracy level-raising map is getting computed for the wrong space!

Prerequisite for #11601. (Note that #11601 depends on a bunch of other stuff as well, but this ticket is independent of any of the other patches in the series.)

In this case, you could re-export the patch and upload the rebased version.

IMHO one should inspect any fuzz anyway.

I have inspected the fuzz, which is caused by patch #10664 having gone in since this was written. It is not a problem; the issue fixed by #10664 is completely orthogonal to this one.
