I have made a patch to make singular build on ARM ; that patch made its way upstream in singular-3-1-3, which isn't in sage yet.

So I'm attaching my patch here, in hope sage will either use my patch or use a newer upstream.

PS: the upstream report is:
http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/299

Depends on #10903

Hopefully during the Sage/Singular Days (SD34) at the end of September, cf. #10903.

Otherwise you could make a new Singular spkg with your patch, based on Sage's latest one, which is singular-3-1-1-4.p13 from #11550 (merged into Sage 4.7.2.alpha0).

If nothing was broken since my work with [upstream](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/299), then indeed that ticket can be closed.

If a new problem arises, then that will be a separate issue.

I have to say that the discussion in bug #10903 where HAVE_ELF_SYSTEM shows up makes me nervous... that looks so wrong when you see the patch "Patch to directly detect ELF support" I gave upstream!

It's not that easy: the platforms in question do not define `__ELF__`. In fact, they aren't fully ELF compatible, (it's about Macs), but Singular just needs an ELF-compatible dlopen here.

It seems the problem was *building* the spkg on ARM.  So it should be sufficient to *build* the spkg from #10903 on ARM.

Of course, if you want to test that it actually works, you also need the patches.  But instead you can also download and build [sage-4.7.2.alpha4](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.2.alpha4/), which includes the new Singular spkg.
