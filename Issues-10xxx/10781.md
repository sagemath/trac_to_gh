Oh. I did it myself just to avoid you the trouble of doing this. Anyway you're the only Author of this patch, it's just to make the review quicker `:-)`

So it's up to you : just don't forget to set the ticket to "positive review" so that the release manager will eventually merge the two tickets !

Replying to [@kini](#comment%3A9):
> Hi Jeroen, thanks for your advice as usual! After looking through the link you provided, and also the file I am modifying ( sage/graphs/graph_generators.py ), it seems that all the other links to Wikipedia or MathWorld are using single underscores. The only difference seemed to be that in my links, the text of the link (i.e. the name given to the reference) was attached to the context of the sentence it was in, rather than being a standalone phrase. I attempted to fix that, instead of doubling the underscores. Is that acceptable?

I guess this is acceptable, yes.  I still have to build the documentation and see what it gives, but I guess it's okay.
