The only difference seemed to be that in my links, the text of the link (i.e. the name given to the reference) was attached to the context of the sentence it was in, rather than being a standalone phrase. I attempted to fix that, instead of doubling the underscores. Is that acceptable?

I guess this is acceptable, yes.  I still have to build the documentation and see what it gives, but I guess it's okay.
