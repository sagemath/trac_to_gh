Hellooooooooooo !!

Well, this fixes the bug but it also means that the object that is pickled does not necessarily correspond to the original one, as the new one admits multiple edges `^^;`

What about setting ``multiple_edges = self._multiple_edges`` as it seems to be defined ? And there is an ``allow_loops()`` method for the other argument.

Hi! I think this is not the case because the DiGraph object is not used in the resulting tuple -- it is just a device to get all arcs. Maybe I don't understand it correctly, but I assume that allow_multiedges is pickled one level higher, in the SparseGraphBackend object.

```
sage: loads(dumps(Graph({0: [1]})))
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: loads(dumps(Graph({0: [1,1]})))
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
```

What do you think?
