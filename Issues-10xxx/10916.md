Hellooooooooooo !!

Well, this fixes the bug but it also means that the object that is pickled does not necessarily correspond to the original one, as the new one admits multiple edges `^^;`

What about setting ``multiple_edges = self._multiple_edges`` as it seems to be defined ? And there is an ``allow_loops()`` method for the other argument.

Quite obviously that I said something stupid `:-)`

Give me a few seconds to give it a more attentive look `:-p`
