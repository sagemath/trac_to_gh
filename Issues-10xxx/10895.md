I've worked up a python module and an associated spkg that basically wraps numpy in a way that makes it useful for doing finite-dimensional quantum mechanics over several particles.  In particular, this should be useful for quantum information.  The features that are currently available more or less reflect what I have needed in order to do the things that I am currently working on.  More information is available on the project's web page, linked below.

The module is available from:
[http://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/](http://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/)

This package works in python and in Sage.  In Sage it is possible to create arrays (or tensors if you wish to call it that) over SR (or in fact any commutative ring).

The git repo contains both the python and the spkg sources and is the "main" source.  The tarballs and spkg are built from that.

Paul,

You need to first do "from qitensor import *".  If the spkg is supposed to import itself automatically, then I don't know how to make that happen (and can't see anything about that in the sage documentation).  On my box the qudit() function works if I first import:



```
sage: from qitensor import *
sage: qudit()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/dstahlke/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: qudit() takes at least 2 arguments (0 given)

```

- Dan

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nthanks Dan. A few comments:\n\n* the SPKG.txt file only mentions version 0.1, not version 0.8\n\n* the documentation on http://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/doc/index.html is for Python, not for\n  Sage. In particular the output we get from Sage is different, for example:\n\n```\nsage: from qitensor import qubit\nsage: ha = qubit('a')\nsage: hb = qubit('b')\nsage: (ha * hb).array()\n[0]\n[0]\n[-]\n[0]\n[0]\n```\nwhich differs from the first example in\nhttp://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/doc/examples/slices.html\n|a,b>\n\n* you have added a 3rd item (c) in the original 2-clause BSD license, with the consequence that\n  it is no longer a 2-clause BSD license.

thanks Dan. A few comments:

* the SPKG.txt file only mentions version 0.1, not version 0.8

* the documentation on http://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/doc/index.html is for Python, not for
  Sage. In particular the output we get from Sage is different, for example:

```
sage: from qitensor import qubit
sage: ha = qubit('a')
sage: hb = qubit('b')
sage: (ha * hb).array()
[0]
[0]
[-]
[0]
[0]
```
which differs from the first example in
http://www.stahlke.org/dan/qitensor/doc/examples/slices.html
|a,b>

* you have added a 3rd item (c) in the original 2-clause BSD license, with the consequence that
  it is no longer a 2-clause BSD license. Please fix that.

* I tried the tests and some of them failed (with sage-4.8.alpha6):

```
The following tests failed:
        sage -t  "qitensor-0.8/src/qitensor/array.py"
        sage -t  "qitensor-0.8/src/qitensor/atom.py"
        sage -t  "qitensor-0.8/src/qitensor/circuit.py"
        sage -t  "qitensor-0.8/src/qitensor/space.py"
Total time for all tests: 38.5 seconds
```

* finally some documentation and doctests are missing (here for `circuit.py`):

```
tiramisu% ../../../sage -coverage circuit.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
circuit.py
SCORE circuit.py: 0% (0 of 3)

Missing doctests:
         * cphase(h1, h2):
         * cnot(h1, h2):
         * max_entangled(h1, h2):
```

Paul,

Most of the issues you raise are due to qitensor using Sage's matrix display function in Sage and numpy's display function when in python.  This causes the doctest results to be different.  I suppose the solution would be to either always use numpy's display function (which isn't as nice) or to write my own display function.  I'll have to think this over, feel free to make suggestions.

The other items you list are easy to fix and I'll get on that as soon as I have some free time.

Thanks,
Dan
