1. I think that it is OK that a private method `_affine_coordinates` does not check if the input is valid (i.e. you can pass a point which is not in the affine space), but it is worth noting this feature in its documentation.
   2. There are some copy-paste typos in the math part of `automorphism_group` docstring.
   3. `assert(False)` looks really weird, even though I understand what does it mean. Personally, I'd rather not have that line at all.
   4. It would be nice to have an action by permutations on polyhedra. (This can wait for another ticket.)
   5. The most important point: the description of the computed group is not entirely clear and I am not sure if you planned the behaviour in the examples below. It seems to me that you need to switch to projective embedding to apply the algorithm. It also seems to me that you need to get rid of the lines first since otherwise the computed group becomes very obscure, since even directions of line generators are not uniquely determined.
   6. If the computed group is not the group of symmetries in a clear way, I don't think that the name `automorphism_group` is justified. It should be either more descriptive or take a mandatory parameter specifying its type, like `automorphism_group("restricted")` with `automorphism_group()` raising an exception. I think that at least for bounded polyhedra `automorphism_group` should mean GL(R,n)-symmetries.

Examples:

```
sage: points = map(vector, [(1,0), (0,1), (-2,-1)])
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=points)
sage: p.automorphism_group().order()
2
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[pt - points[0] for pt in points])
sage: p.automorphism_group().order()
6
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[pt - points[1] for pt in points])
sage: p.automorphism_group().order()
6
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[pt - 2*points[1] for pt in points])
sage: p.automorphism_group().order()
1
```
I want to get the same number in each case. Personally, I like 2 as the number of GL(Z,2)-symmetries, but as I understand the referenced paper, it should be 6, the number of GL(R,2)-symmetries.

Thanks for catching the translation bug. The restricted automorphism group should be `D_6` (dihedral group with 6 elements) in all cases. 

I've renamed the method to `restricted_automorphism_group()`.

I don't think that you can't get rid of lines; The Polyhedron class makes no guarantees that the vertex and ray generators are in a common hypersurface of codimension = number of lines. So the restricted automorphism group will always depend on the presentation of the polyhedron. Once you embrace this fact there is no particular reason to disallow permutations of line generators...

Yes, the "not" is important :-)

I guess you want the linear automorphism group as `automorphism_group()`? There is also the combinatorial automorphism group... Note that the restricted automorphism group equals the linear automorphism group in the case of a full-dimensional compact polyhedron.

I think the (linear) `automorphism_group()` should return the group elements as Euclidean group elements. But there is no class for that, and tuples `(A,b)` isn't that intuitive. I don't have time to implement it right now, maybe later. Need to figure out what to do with the continuous group generators, too...

If your polytope is a lattice polytope then the restricted automorphism group is automatically a subgroup of the lattice Euclidean group `GL(d,Z) |x Z^d`.

Fixing some absolute threshold in advance for `x-c` will lead to incorrect work with \"small\" polyhedra, but maybe some rough estimate for the diameter can be used. E.g. it is relatively cheap to compute the bounding box of the polyhedra generators and then declare its size divided by 10<sup>6</sup> or so to be zero. Or one can try to be more clever and choose this tolerance based on the actual \"edge colors\" before rounding. The current version seems to be too fragile to me.\n3.

First of all, let me correct myself - when I was talking about GL-symmetries, of course I meant affine-linear ones - they just happen to be the same for reflexive polytopes and I forgot about general situation.

I am more interested in the linear automorphism group and even more in the lattice preserving one, rather than in the combinatorial one. I think the abundance of automorphism groups indicates that maybe we should never have a method called just `automorphism_group`, but always indicate its kind, as it is done in the new patch.

The current implementation does not preserve the lattice - the example that I have given above is the polytope of WP(1,1,2) and one of the edges has length 2 while others only 1. So there is only one lattice-preserving symmetry. (But that's OK for this ticket.)

Previously raised issues were addressed, but I have some new comments :-)
1. "Note that there are no translations possible since `Q` contains only a single vertex." is a bit misleading. "Separate" translations are possible iff there is a non-trivial linear subspace. In this case you probably meant that there are no "translation components" attached to matrices, since there is only a single vertex. I think this either should be explained in more detail, or not mentioned at all.
2. I don't understand how the floating point part works. I am not at all an expert on such cases, but I don't understand how calling a function returning `x == 0` is any different from direct comparison with 0, which should not be done for floating point numbers anyway. How can it ever return `True` for anything but exactly zero? It seems to me that you should be comparing `x-c` with the absolute value of `x` and `c` and if the ratio is too small, declare it to be zero. Probably some care should be taken in the case when `x` or `c` is actually zero. Fixing some absolute threshold in advance for `x-c` will lead to incorrect work with "small" polyhedra, but maybe some rough estimate for the diameter can be used. E.g. it is relatively cheap to compute the bounding box of the polyhedra generators and then declare its size divided by 10<sup>6</sup> or so to be zero. Or one can try to be more clever and choose this tolerance based on the actual "edge colors" before rounding. The current version seems to be too fragile to me.
3. I think you should treat vertices and rays/lines differently when constructing `v_list`, adding 1 to vertices (which fixed translation issues above) and 0 to others. Otherwise

 ```
 sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0), (1,1)], rays=[(1,0)])
 sage: p.restricted_automorphism_group().order()
 1
```
 while it should be 2, I think.

I'm planning to make `_is_zero`, `_is_nonneg` and `_is_positive` into overloaded methods when I split up `Polyhedron` into different backends. But first I wanted to commit the outstanding patches I have.

I'm not sure that labeling the edges with the number of lattice points restricts to the lattice Euclidean group automatically. Can't you still map a minimal 2-d triangle, say, to one with an interior point (but no lattice point on the edges)? Thats of course not a counterexample, but its not clear to me that that might not happen on faces of higher-dimensional polyhedra...

Updated patch for 1. and 3. is attached. I've also added a `combinatorial_automorphism_group()` method to compare with.
