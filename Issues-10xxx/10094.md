I still can't build C++ cython modules, even though it should be possible with the cython-0.13.

The problem seems to be that cython expects `--cplus` to enable the new language features. Cython does not derive this from the output file name extension ('cpp').

I've written the obvious patch to `setup.py`, see attachment.

Givaro, one of the C++ extension modules, is very unhappy about `cython --cplus`.

The problem is this snippet from `element_givaro.pyx`, where `PY_TYPE_CHECK` is declared a second time. It is then ambiguous with its first declaration.

```
cdef extern from "stdsage.h":
    [...]
    int PY_TYPE_CHECK(object o, object t)
```
Removing this one line works, patch attached. I did a `sage -ba` and had no more troubles.
