The problem seems to be that cython expects `--cplus` to enable the new language features. Cython does not derive this from the output file name extension ('cpp').

I've written the obvious patch to `setup.py`, see attachment.

Apply [attachment: trac_10094_add_cplus_command_line_option.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10094/trac_10094_add_cplus_command_line_option.patch.gz) and [attachment: 10094_fix_doctests.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10094/10094_fix_doctests.2.patch.gz).

The problem is this snippet from `element_givaro.pyx`, where `PY_TYPE_CHECK` is declared a second time. It is then ambiguous with its first declaration.

```
cdef extern from "stdsage.h":

    int PY_TYPE_CHECK(object o, object t)

Removing this one line works, patch attached. I did a `sage -ba` and had no more troubles.

Initially I of course used `language="c++"`, this does not work. If you look at the original patch, all that does is switch the output file name extension to `cpp`. And cython then still relies on the `--cplus` switch. I don't know if thats a cython bug or intentional design. Robert, you should be able to tell us?

Also, note that the patch only adds `--cplus` if `language="c++"` in `module_list.py`
