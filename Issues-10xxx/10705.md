Calling twice in a row the function `unpickle_all` breaks sage:

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
x...
Successfully unpickled 586 objects.
Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()

7292 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
$
```

Doing some `print i, A` inside the loop of the function `unpickle_all` shows that the process stop on the 170th :

```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
