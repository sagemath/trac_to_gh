After running `./sage -bdist VERSION` with an already built Sage 4.6.alpha3 and unpacking the resulting binary distribution, the binary distribution does not run:

```python
$ ./sage
[...]
ImportError: No module named sagenb.misc.sphinxify
[...]
```
I think this happens because `devel/sagenb-main` and `devel/sagenb` are missing:

```
$ ls devel/
total 4.1k
   0 sage@  4.1k sage-main/
```

It does for me.  I applied the patch to a clean, built-from-scratch 4.6.alpha3 and ran

  `./sage -bdist 4.6.alpha3-sage.math.washington.edu`

The new binary passes the long doctests, except for a flaky test in `sage/graphs/graph.py` (see the 4.6 blocker #10081). I've copied the binary to `/home/release/sage-4.6.alpha3` on the Sage cluster.
