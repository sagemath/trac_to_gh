After running `./sage -bdist VERSION` with an already built Sage 4.6.alpha3 and unpacking the resulting binary distribution, the binary distribution does not run:

```python
$ ./sage
[...]
ImportError: No module named sagenb.misc.sphinxify
[...]
```
I think this happens because `devel/sagenb-main` and `devel/sagenb` are missing:

```
$ ls devel/
total 4.1k
   0 sage@  4.1k sage-main/
```
