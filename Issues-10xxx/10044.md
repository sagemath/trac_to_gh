Updated to follow the modifications of the LP interface ! The documentation has been slightly improved too. Note that this new version is pure Python, as I thought better to avoid Cython to have a more readable code. The loss in speed shouldn't be that bad either... If anybody complains, we will have a Cython formulation kept on this ticket anyway !
