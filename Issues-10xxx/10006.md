According to the documentation in `sage/interfaces/gp.py`, the following should reproduce the `gp` help for the function `gcd()`.  Instead, we get useless output:

```
sage: gp.gcd?
Type:           GpFunction
Base Class:     <class 'sage.interfaces.gp.GpFunction'>
String Form:    gcd
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/interfaces/gp.py
Definition:     gp.gcd(self, *args, **kwds)
Docstring:
    gcd(x,{y}): greatest common divisor of x and y.
Call def:       gp.gcd(self, *args, **kwds)

Call docstring:
    x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature
```
