I have found several issues factoring polynomials over number fields.

**First issue**, fixed by #10430 (see also #10279):

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1); t=polygen(K)
sage: l = (-1/7*a^5 - 1/7*a^4 - 1/7*a^3 - 1/7*a^2 - 2/7*a - 1/7)*t^10 + (4/7*a^5 - 2/7*a^4 - 2/7*a^3 - 2/7*a^2 - 2/7*a - 6/7)*t^9 + (90/49*a^5 + 152/49*a^4 + 18/49*a^3 + 24/49*a^2 + 30/49*a + 36/49)*t^8 + (-10/49*a^5 + 10/7*a^4 + 198/49*a^3 - 102/49*a^2 - 60/49*a - 26/49)*t^7 + (40/49*a^5 + 45/49*a^4 + 60/49*a^3 + 277/49*a^2 - 204/49*a - 78/49)*t^6 + (90/49*a^5 + 110/49*a^4 + 2*a^3 + 80/49*a^2 + 46/7*a - 30/7)*t^5 + (30/7*a^5 + 260/49*a^4 + 250/49*a^3 + 232/49*a^2 + 32/7*a + 8)*t^4 + (-184/49*a^5 - 58/49*a^4 - 52/49*a^3 - 66/49*a^2 - 72/49*a - 72/49)*t^3 + (18/49*a^5 - 32/49*a^4 + 10/49*a^3 + 4/49*a^2)*t^2 + (2/49*a^4 - 4/49*a^3 + 2/49*a^2)*t
sage: factor(l)
```

Depending on the execution I get two answers.  A wrong answer

```
(-1/7*a^5 - 1/7*a^4 - 1/7*a^3 - 1/7*a^2 - 2/7*a - 1/7) * t^4 * (t^6 + (-19/7*a^5 - 17/7*a^4 - 15/7*a^3 - 13/7*a^2 - 11/7*a - 9/7)*t^5 + (2*a^5 - 10/7*a^4 - 16/7*a^3 + 10/7*a^2 - 2/7*a + 18/7)*t^4 + (-40/7*a^5 - 8/7*a^4 - 40/7*a^3 - 48/7*a^2 - 32/7)*t^3 + (26/7*a^5 - 6/7*a^4 + 26/7*a^3 - 6/7*a^2 - 4/7*a + 34/7)*t^2 + (-20/7*a^5 - 4/7*a^4 - 20/7*a^3 - 4/7*a^2 - 20/7*a - 16/7)*t + 2/7*a^5 - 2/7*a^4 + 2/7*a^3 - 2/7*a^2 + 2/7*a - 2/7)
```
or a correct answer:

```
(-1/7*a^5 - 1/7*a^4 - 1/7*a^3 - 1/7*a^2 - 2/7*a - 1/7) * t * (t - a^5 - a^4 - a^3 - a^2 - a - 1)^4 * (t^5 + (-12/7*a^5 - 10/7*a^4 - 8/7*a^3 - 6/7*a^2 - 4/7*a - 2/7)*t^4 + (12/7*a^5 - 8/7*a^3 + 16/7*a^2 + 2/7*a + 20/7)*t^3 + (-20/7*a^5 - 20/7*a^3 - 20/7*a^2 + 4/7*a - 2)*t^2 + (12/7*a^5 + 12/7*a^3 + 2/7*a + 16/7)*t - 4/7*a^5 - 4/7*a^3 - 4/7*a - 2/7)
```

**Second issue:**

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1); t=polygen(K)
sage: l2 = (1/7*a^2 - 1/7*a)*t^10 + (4/7*a - 6/7)*t^9 + (102/49*a^5 + 99/49*a^4 + 96/49*a^3 + 93/49*a^2 + 90/49*a + 150/49)*t^8 + (-160/49*a^5 - 36/49*a^4 - 48/49*a^3 - 8/7*a^2 - 60/49*a - 60/49)*t^7 + (30/49*a^5 - 55/49*a^4 + 20/49*a^3 + 5/49*a^2)*t^6 + (6/49*a^4 - 12/49*a^3 + 6/49*a^2)*t^5
sage: factor(l2)  # WARNING --- eats all memory
```

It is t**5 times an ireducible polynomial. GP released with Sage computes the factorization without problems, but trying to compute the factorization with Sage the program starts to eat all available RAM and you have to kill the program.  GP session of what actually happens (note that `l2` is not monic):

```
K = nfinit(a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)
f = Mod(1, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^10 + Mod(4/7*a - 6/7, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^9 + Mod(9/49*a^2 - 3/7*a + 15/49, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^8 + Mod(8/343*a^3 - 32/343*a^2 + 40/343*a - 20/343, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^7 + Mod(5/2401*a^4 - 20/2401*a^3 + 40/2401*a^2 - 5/343*a + 15/2401, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^6 + Mod(-6/16807*a^4 + 12/16807*a^3 - 18/16807*a^2 + 12/16807*a - 6/16807, a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1)*x^5
nffactor(K, f)
```

Second issue is [PARI bug 1141](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1141).  See #10430 for a fix.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I think this is very likely a pari bug, and is the same one ([http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1132](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1132)) that was fixed in response to #10279.  If I'm right, it would be solved by #10430.

This is the simplest example (of the first problem) that I have found:

```
trousseau-bash% sage-4.6/sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: L.<a> = QuadraticField(3)
sage: PL.<y> = L[]
sage: (y*(y^2 - (1 + a)/3)*(y^2 - a/2)^2).factor()
y^3 * (y^4 + (-5/6*a - 1/3)*y^2 + 1/6*a + 1/2)
```
This is the equivalent in pari (producing the same erroneous result):
| Sage Version 4.6, Release Date: 2010-10-30                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
```
trousseau-bash% sage-4.6/sage -gp
                   GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.4.3 (development svn-12577:12605)
                    i386 running darwin (x86-64/GMP-4.2.1 kernel) 64-bit version
...
parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500509
? K = nfinit(a^2 - 3);
? f = x*(x^2 + Mod(-(a + 1)/3, a^2 - 3))*(x^2 + Mod(-a/2, a^2 - 3))^2;
? nffactor(K, f)
%1 = 
[x 3]

[x^4 + Mod(-5/6*a - 1/3, a^2 - 3)*x^2 + Mod(1/6*a + 1/2, a^2 - 3) 1]

```
But with the version of pari in sage 4.5.3 the result is correct:

```
trousseau-bash% sage-4.5.3/sage -gp
                            GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.3.5 (released)
                    i386 running darwin (x86-64/GMP-4.2.1 kernel) 64-bit version
 ...
parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500000
? K = nfinit(a^2 - 3);
? f = x*(x^2 + Mod(-(a + 1)/3, a^2 - 3))*(x^2 + Mod(-a/2, a^2 - 3))^2;
? nffactor(K, f)
%1 = 
[x 1]

[x^2 + Mod(-1/2*a, a^2 - 3) 2]

[x^2 + Mod(-1/3*a - 1/3, a^2 - 3) 1]

```

I have corrected the second example, with gp I have no problems to factor the polynomial. Maybe the problem is with libpari.

With the latests versions of PARI we do not need to be so careful with non-monic polynomials. In the future we may consider eliminating the unit parameter from _factor_pari_helper.
