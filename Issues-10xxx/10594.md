> it seems to work for me, but how does one really test it?


In a Sage shell ("sage -sh"), unpack the spkg and go into the `src` directory. There, you can build the package (just do `make all`) and then run Mercurial's built-in tests: `make tests`.

Interestingly, on a regular Ubuntu machine (on which Mercurial works perfectly fine) some of the tests don't pass; it seems like their tests want to have the `unzip` utility available.

The .spkg installs fine in Linux, and on t2.math. I'm going to take a look at OS X. Mercurial is very well tested and cross-platform, so I would be very surprised if we have any problems.

one should at least test that the combinat stuff works. This is one of the most immediate and tricky uses of hg in Sage.

The spkg builds and installs on t2.math and bsd.math. I ran tests on those two machines and on an Ubuntu machine, and I got some failures on all three...but the failures seem to be the same as what we got with 1.6.4.

I tried the combinat patch queue, and it works the same as it does in 4.6.1.rc1 with Mercurial 1.6.4. The [upgrade notes](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UpgradeNotes) don't mention anything that affects our use of Mercurial, so positive review.

After some issues on #9433, I wonder if this should be reopened.  There are some incompatibilities between Mercurial 1.7.3 and earlier versions; see [this web page](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UpgradingMercurial#Upgrading_and_downgrading_repository_formats).  I think the issues is this: 

- any new repositories created with 1.7.3 (without including a flag like `--config format.dotencode=False`) will not be usable by versions before 1.7.

I think a reasonable argument could be made for merging 1.7.3 anyway: when dealing with Sage, it's not a huge requirement to ask people to use the Mercurial distributed with Sage instead of some older version installed elsewhere on their machine.

But perhaps a reasonable argument could be made on the other side: why create repositories which can't be read by Mercurial 1.6.4 or earlier?  Should we back out 1.7.3 altogether?

We could also keep 1.7.3 but require all repos to be created with the flag `--config format.dotencode=False`.  I personally think that this is unwieldy.

Any opinions?

hg repositories made with 1.7.3 cannot be manipulated using versions of mercurial <1.7.  Because of this backwards incompatible change and because I see no compelling reason to upgrade Mercurial, I want to be on the safe side and unmerge #10594 (i.e. revert to Mercurial version 1.6.4) in the sage-4.6.2 release.

In some later Sage release, we can still decide to upgrade Mercurial.

I think we do, I don't think we should simply upgrade packages for the sake of upgrading.  I think the incompatibility with older versions of Mercurial is a negative point for upgrading Mercurial.  Only if there is a particular feature of Mercurial 1.8.4 which is really useful, then I think we should upgrade.

On first glance, this looks okay.  There are a few extraneous files in the spkg:

```
$ hg status
? .SPKG.txt.swp
? .SPKG.txt.un~
? .spkg-install.un~
```
So of course they should be cleaned up.

If someone upgrades from an earlier version of mercurial on OS X, should we check for and delete the old file SAGE/local/bin/hgmerge?

A full review of this spkg should probably include a runthrough of `sage -bdist`, `sage -sdist`, and friends. I can easily believe that hg's self-tests are successful and that Mercurial builds properly from my spkg; what is less clear is whether the newer version of Mercurial breaks any of Sage's various shell scripts that currently use it to do various mysterious things during release management and other such activities. It looks like Jeroen has the spkg in 4.7.1.alpha4 as of right now, though, so I'm guessing he's testing these things at the moment.
