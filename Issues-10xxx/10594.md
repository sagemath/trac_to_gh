In a Sage shell ("sage -sh"), unpack the spkg and go into the `src` directory. There, you can build the package (just do `make all`) and then run Mercurial's built-in tests: `make tests`.

Interestingly, on a regular Ubuntu machine (on which Mercurial works perfectly fine) some of the tests don't pass; it seems like their tests want to have the `unzip` utility available.

The .spkg installs fine in Linux, and on t2.math. I'm going to take a look at OS X. Mercurial is very well tested and cross-platform, so I would be very surprised if we have any problems.

one should at least test that the combinat stuff works. This is one of the most immediate and tricky uses of hg in Sage.

There are some incompatibilities between Mercurial 1.7.3 and earlier versions; see [this web page](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UpgradingMercurial#Upgrading_and_downgrading_repository_formats).  I think the issues is this: 

- any new repositories created with 1.7.3 (without including a flag like `--config format.dotencode=False`) will not be usable by versions before 1.7.

I think a reasonable argument could be made for merging 1.7.3 anyway: when dealing with Sage, it's not a huge requirement to ask people to use the Mercurial distributed with Sage instead of some older version installed elsewhere on their machine.

But perhaps a reasonable argument could be made on the other side: why create repositories which can't be read by Mercurial 1.6.4 or earlier?  Should we back out 1.7.3 altogether?

We could also keep 1.7.3 but require all repos to be created with the flag `--config format.dotencode=False`.  I personally think that this is unwieldy.

Any opinions?

I think we do, I don't think we should simply upgrade packages for the sake of upgrading.  I think the incompatibility with older versions of Mercurial is a negative point for upgrading Mercurial.  Only if there is a particular feature of Mercurial 1.8.4 which is really useful, then I think we should upgrade.

So of course they should be cleaned up.

If someone upgrades from an earlier version of mercurial on OS X, should we check for and delete the old file SAGE/local/bin/hgmerge?

This is not a backwards-incompatible change in 1.7 -- it is a forward-incompatibility in 1.6.x.

If we upgrade Mercurial in Sage, the user's system Mercurial may not be able to handle packages created by the sage scripts, but this is not a problem because in those cases the user can do `echo alias hg="sage -hg" >> ~/.bashrc` and go on with their life. The proportion of users for which this will be a problem will only decrease with time. Also, rather than being an inconvenience, this will actually improve the user's life, since they have access to a newer version of Mercurial than they would otherwise.
