In a Sage shell ("sage -sh"), unpack the spkg and go into the `src` directory. There, you can build the package (just do `make all`) and then run Mercurial's built-in tests: `make tests`.

Interestingly, on a regular Ubuntu machine (on which Mercurial works perfectly fine) some of the tests don't pass; it seems like their tests want to have the `unzip` utility available.

The .spkg installs fine in Linux, and on t2.math. I'm going to take a look at OS X. Mercurial is very well tested and cross-platform, so I would be very surprised if we have any problems.

- any new repositories created with 1.7.3 (without including a flag like `--config format.dotencode=False`) will not be usable by versions before 1.7.

I think a reasonable argument could be made for merging 1.7.3 anyway: when dealing with Sage, it's not a huge requirement to ask people to use the Mercurial distributed with Sage instead of some older version installed elsewhere on their machine.

But perhaps a reasonable argument could be made on the other side: why create repositories which can't be read by Mercurial 1.6.4 or earlier?  Should we back out 1.7.3 altogether?

We could also keep 1.7.3 but require all repos to be created with the flag `--config format.dotencode=False`.  I personally think that this is unwieldy.

Any opinions?

hg repositories made with 1.7.3 cannot be manipulated using versions of mercurial <1.7.  Because of this backwards incompatible change and because I see no compelling reason to upgrade Mercurial, I want to be on the safe side and unmerge #10594 (i.e. revert to Mercurial version 1.6.4) in the sage-4.6.2 release.

I think we do, I don't think we should simply upgrade packages for the sake of upgrading.  I think the incompatibility with older versions of Mercurial is a negative point for upgrading Mercurial.  Only if there is a particular feature of Mercurial 1.8.4 which is really useful, then I think we should upgrade.

On first glance, this looks okay.  There are a few extraneous files in the spkg:

```
$ hg status
? .SPKG.txt.swp
? .SPKG.txt.un~
? .spkg-install.un~
```
So of course they should be cleaned up.

If someone upgrades from an earlier version of mercurial on OS X, should we check for and delete the old file SAGE/local/bin/hgmerge?
