The updated spkg moves the `-lm` compiler flag past `-lsymmetrica` when building the test program, adds an `spkg-check` file, honors `LDFLAGS`, and removes the obsolete Debian `dist/` directory.

This patch / new spkg will also be necessary for newer Debians like e.g. Ubuntu 11.10, which feature (the good old) stricter linker semantics; cf. [comment:ticket:11674:38] ff.

Our current Singular (3-1-1-4) spkg also has issues with wrong library order, namely `-ldl` and `-lkernel`.

A couple of more or less minor issues:

* Michael Abshoff should be removed from the spkg maintainer list.

* [http://www.symmetrica.de/](http://www.symmetrica.de/) is perhaps a more stable upstream link (currently redirected to [http://www.algorithm.uni-bayreuth.de/en/research/SYMMETRICA/](http://www.algorithm.uni-bayreuth.de/en/research/SYMMETRICA/)).

* `s/sort tp/sort to/` in `SPKG.txt`

* `$CFLAG64` should be quoted in `[ -z $CFLAG64 ]`. (And exporting `CFLAGS` there is really redundant.)

* Not all user-specified `CFLAGS` should be overridden by Sage's (e.g. `-O2` should precede `$CFLAGS` in the assignment).

* The exit codes of `patch` (and `cp`) aren't checked. (`makefile` could also be patched rather than copied over. `SPKG.txt` mentions `patches/makefile.patch`, though  there's only `patches/makefile`.)

* (GNU) `patch` should be added as a dependency.

* `$MAKE -f makefile` is redundant.

* `$SAGE_LOCAL` should be quoted.

* `cp` for installation (library, headers) should use `-p`, otherwise the current umask could break permissions.

* The new `makefile` removes the `test` target, which builds an executable functioning as a minimalistic test suite. (The removal also removes `-lm` completely, such that the changelog entry regarding that no longer applies.)


The "usual" superfluous trailing semicolon inside the sanity check is *of course*<sup>TM</sup> also there; `[ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]` is also better than comparing to an empty string.

Making this a **blocker**, since IMHO this should be fixed in the **final Sage 4.7.2**, likely to be released [right] before the final Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot), in contrast to a *final* Sage 4.7.3 ...

(Hereby also pinging myself...)

P.S.: The description isn't up-to-date, as the current spkg doesn't use `-lm` at all, since it doesn't build the test program (which it IMHO should, as a minimalistic test suite, unless it provides and runs some other test(s), at least if `SAGE_CHECK=yes`).

Sorry, you were too quick (or I was too slow...):


The commit message looks like a copy-paste accident, but the spkg was made on 28st[sic] September anyway. :)




`spkg-check` should also use `$MAKE`.

If you also **build** `test` in `spkg-check`, you have to setup `CFLAGS` etc. there in the same way as in `spkg-install`.

`s/exitting/exiting/`.

The error message should start with "`Error`" (or "`Failed`").

(The whole test could be simplified by

```sh
if ! diff spkg-check.actual spkg-check.expected; then
    echo >&2 "Error: The symmetrica test suite failed (see diff output above)."
    exit 1
# Optionally:
#else
#    echo "All tests passed." # or whatever
fi
# EOF
```




Do we need `LDFLAGS` when linking `test`?

I.e., for example `-m64`, which we *could* take from `CFLAG64`, but using `LDFLAG64` (defaulting to `-m64`) would be cleaner.




I don't like the `set +/-o errexit`, as it doesn't necessarily give a meaningful (and easy to search for) error message. Therefore we removed all instances of `set +/-e` previously.

Instead, you could use the usual loop for applying the patches, exiting with an appropriate error message upon the first patch which doesn't apply:

```sh
for patch in ../patches; do
    patch < "$patch"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: Patch \"$patch\" failed to apply. Exiting...
        exit 1
    fi
done
# Copy over makefile and check $?
# or create also a *patch* for 'makefile' to be applied
# in the loop above, too.
```

Similar for the "installation":

`spkg-install` will only exit with a non-zero status if **the last** copy command failed. You could either check each exit code, giving an appropriate error message for each individual case, or use

```
foo &&
bar &&
baz
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: Failed to install Symmetrica."
    exit 1
fi
```
