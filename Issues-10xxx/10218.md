As the subject says. This is a follow-up to #10201. From [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d83f8d87962f8a9f/), William Stein announced this blog entry:

http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-referee-sage-trac-tickets.html

It would be a shame if new developers of Sage could not easily find it.

With the switch to git, both sections on reviewing were streamlined. The link to William's blog made in #10201 was presumably removed because it talks about mercurial.

We make the following changes:
* add a short summary on top of the walkthrough section (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid)
* add a paragraph about reviewer's patches to in-depth section
* refer with caveat to blog post, again, literature style

I will discuss these changes on the grounds of me having been bitten by the absence of them.

 It would be a shame if new developers of Sage could not easily find it.
+
+With the switch to git, both sections on reviewing were streamlined. The link to William's blog made in #10201 was presumably removed because it talks about mercurial.
+
+We make the following changes:
+* add a short summary on top of the walkthrough section (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid)
+* add a paragraph about reviewer's patches to in-depth section
+* refer with caveat to blog post, again, literature style
