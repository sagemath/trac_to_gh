The following was reported by Mark Watkins.

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: Lp = E.padic_lseries(3)
sage: Lp.series(4)
O(3^6) + O(3^3)*T + (2 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + O(3^3))*T^2 + (2 + O(3^2))*T^3 +
 (1 + 2*3 + O(3^3))*T^4 + O(T^5)
sage: Lp.series(5)
O(3^7) + O(3^4)*T + (2 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + O(3^4))*T^2 + (2 + O(3^3))*T^3 +
 (1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 2*3^3 + O(3^4))*T^4 + O(T^5)
```

Note that the term 2*3<sup>2</sup>  in T<sup>4</sup> has appeared in the second computation.

As Mark suggests further, this is likely a problem with `_prec_bounds`

 "Should the `_prec_bounds` take
 some sort of maximum over valuation of coefficients (say all i up to j)
 rather than just the valuation of the jth one?"

The following comment is about the purposely slightly incorrect output in the second/third patch:

```
Note that this is mainly a problem about the printing. The
coefficients print as zero when they should be in fact zero up to some
(negative) precision.

The docstring is still a good documentation for someone who wants to
use the function.
I can not fix #10698, nor #4656, and I fear they are not going to be fixed soon.
I could have removed the docstring or cut the precision in T to 3, but
I would like to have it like that once the #10698 is fixed. The person
fixing that would maybe not want to do it.

Chris Wuthrich.
