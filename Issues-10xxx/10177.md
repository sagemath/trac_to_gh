The transformation matrix returned by 'is_Gamma0_equivalent' for number field cusps is not in Gamma0(N). My fault (this is even wrong in the example I wrote for the documentation, sorry...):

```
  sage: k.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 5)
  sage: N = k.ideal(3)
  sage: alpha = NFCusp(k, 3, a + 1)
  sage: beta = NFCusp(k, 2, a - 3)
  sage: alpha.is_Gamma0_equivalent(beta, N, Transformation=True)
  (True, [2*a - 4, -3*a - 4, -5*a + 2, 3*a + 13])
 ```
The matrix is not in Gamma0(3)!

It's not difficult to compute the right matrix. I'll be happy to write a patch in a few weeks (after I submit my thesis).

Looks fine to me, and all doctests in sage/modular pass. (I set the milestone to 4.6.2, as 4.6.1 is in feature freeze, I believe).
