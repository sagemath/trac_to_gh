If I try to print the html documentation,for example, here:

http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_rings.html

The (blank) sidebar takes up a couple of inches on the left, and the rightmost couple of inches is cut off.

This was reported by Dan Willis.

I can confirm this by doing a print preview using Firefox. A work around is to collapse the side bar. You can do this by clicking on the slim bar that divides the side bar to the left and the documentation to the right. Then do a print preview again using Firefox; the reported problem should then be fixed. As this ticket now stands, I'm inclined to think it can be closed as invalid.

I don't think it's invalid.  A new user will not know to collapse the sidebar to get sensible printing.  I bet most experienced users wouldn't know that either.

I'll change the title to specify printing without collapsing the sidebar.  In reality, there should be a print stylesheet that hides that sidebar automatically.
