Hello !!!

Thank you for this addition !

As we discussed by email whether the set_pos option should be disabled, I end up adding a small patch to yours, but the modifications I originally intended to make turned out to be useless. It was mainly about those ``. ::``, which I believed would have appeared as `. :` in the html documentation. Just a mistake (it turns out that it happens only when there is no space between `.` and `::`), and your patch is good to go ! `:-)`
