Original summary by reporter: sqrt() as scalar multiple of QQbar vector

```
sage: QQbar(sqrt(2))*vector(QQbar, [1,2])
(1.414213562373095?, 2.828427124746190?)

sage: vector(QQbar, [sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2)])
(1.414213562373095?, 2.828427124746190?)

sage: sqrt(2)*vector(QQbar, [1,2])
...
NotImplementedError: symbol
```

This error is confusing: it suggests that the last example is supposed to work, which currently is not the case.

So let me restate my previous comment in a different way: In the first two examples, you are *converting* `sqrt(2)` into an element of `QQbar`, either directly using the syntax `QQbar()`, or less directly by creating a vector. In the third one, you are multiplying an element of `SR` with a vector of elements of `QQbar`, which could trigger a *coercion* if there existed one, but there is none, and IMO that's a good thing.",

True.

Yes, perhaps. At least this is something to keep in mind if one tries to implement a "field of constant symbolic expression" as recently discussed on sage-devel. But I'm not sure it is worth the effort...
