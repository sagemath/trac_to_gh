Original summary by reporter: sqrt() as scalar multiple of QQbar vector

```
sage: QQbar(sqrt(2))*vector(QQbar, [1,2])
(1.414213562373095?, 2.828427124746190?)

sage: vector(QQbar, [sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2)])
(1.414213562373095?, 2.828427124746190?)

sage: sqrt(2)*vector(QQbar, [1,2])
...
NotImplementedError: symbol
```

This error is confusing: it suggests that the last example is supposed to work, which currently is not the case.

True.

Yes, perhaps. At least this is something to keep in mind if one tries to implement a "field of constant symbolic expression" as recently discussed on sage-devel. But I'm not sure it is worth the effort...
