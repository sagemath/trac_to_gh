If you pass .roots() a ring that it can't handle, usually you get a nice exception, but in some cases it segfaults [4.6.2, OS X 10.6.6]:

```
sage: var("a")
a
sage: R.<x> = SR[]
sage: f = x-a
sage: parent(f)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Symbolic Ring
sage: f.roots(RR)

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
