This follows up on #9896.

If there are symbolic links pointing to SAGE_ROOT, then running "sage -b" may cause a warning message like 

```
warning: Replacing library search directory in linker command:
    "[actual SAGE_ROOT directory]/local/lib" -> "[link]/local/lib"
```
It can be distracting having warning messages print when there is actually nothing wrong, so the attached patch removes this warning.  The warning will of course still print if the Sage library has actually been moved.

`os.path.normpath(SAGE_LOCAL+"/lib")` should already be a fully dereferenced path (because `SAGE_ROOT` is), so you could omit the change into `os.path.realpath(sage_libdir)`.

The warning will only show up on MacOS X anyway.

Unfortunately, on Darwin afaik `os.path.realpath()` does not necessarily return a unique name; perhaps this has meanwhile been fixed, but distutils still implement their own `canonicalize_path()` (or whatever it is called) for Darwin.

<a id='comment:3'></a>> Would perhaps look nicer ...


Okay, here's a new patch.

Regarding SAGE_ROOT: note that on my Mac, '/Applications/sage' is a link pointing to the real directory '/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.6/'.

```
sage: SAGE_ROOT
'/Applications/sage'
```
From the command line:

```
$ sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

SAGE_ROOT=/Applications/sage
```
So SAGE_ROOT is not actually "fully dereferenced", if that means what I think it means.  In case it doesn't mean what I think it means:

```
sage: os.path.realpath(SAGE_ROOT) == SAGE_ROOT
False
```
So I think we need os.path.realpath in both places.

> Unfortunately, on Darwin afaik os.path.realpath() does not necessarily return a unique name; perhaps this has meanwhile been fixed, but distutils still implement their own canonicalize_path() (or whatever it is called) for Darwin.


I don't know about this in general, but using os.path.realpath seems to fix this particular problem on my OS X machine.

Ok, then (at least your) MacOS X lacks the `readlink` and `realpath` commands, or you've set `SAGE_ROOT` manually.

In general, I think it would be better to also assign `os.path.realpath(...)` to the Python variables `SAGE_ROOT`, `SAGE_LOCAL` etc. at the top of `setup.py` (line 32 ff.), which would also remove some redundant slashs.

Me either. Perhaps just history (when distutils were not part of the Python distribution), otherwise wouldn't make much sense to have distutils use their own version, leaving the standard Python function limited.

I think that SAGE_ROOT is set in the script sage-env, by running "pwd" in an appropriate directory.  Perhaps with the GNU version of this, it resolves all links.  On Darwin, and it seems perhaps also on Solaris, you need to run "pwd -P" to do this.  On sage.math, 'pwd -P' also resolves links.  So we might also consider something like this change to sage-env:

But only if `SAGE_ROOT` is not already set, which isn't the case if you run some `./sage ...` command, so it's a bit inconsistent.

Oh, but I see: `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` does not use `readlink -e` (which dereferences any symlink contained in its argument); without that, it returns an error if the *last component* is not a link. So if you have just links "in the middle", `sage` uses the basename of itself.

I wonder what new strange side-effects that would have... ;-)

That depends on how you `cd` to a directory, or how a script is called. Which directory do you have in your path?

`$0` should be set according to that inside a script, i.e. its basename should be the one where it was (first) found in your `$PATH` (i.e. even relative if you happen to have "`.`" in your path and the script is in the current directory).
