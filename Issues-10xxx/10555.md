I thought I had added the documentation, but it's in another repository, so it needs a different patch. *sigh*

I think most of them (and their use cases) are fairly self-explanatory, at least after you read the documentation.  If not, then please let me know.

One potential problem is having more than one Sage.app and it getting confused about which version it should use for the service.  Actually, I'll add that to the documentation...  I'm not sure of a work around at the moment.

I can't get this to work.  I thought maybe it was because I had multiple Sages, but even deleting them (though not emptying the Trash) didn't help.  Maybe I'm doing something not quite right.  Perhaps the instructions aren't as complete as they need to be.

But otherwise the infrastructure for this seems to be right on track!  Putting as 'needs work', but feel free to correct me if I just forgot something.

Okay, I'll try this. It will take a while because of having to do the restart or whatever.  

But will this patch still work, or does it need rebasing on #11026?

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>> or just running /System/Library/CoreServices/pbs which should rebuild the services list. If that works, then we should probably add it to the README.\n\n\nAwww yeahhhh.  Yup, this works, so you definitely should add this to the instructions.\n\nUnfortunately, apparently it has trouble deciding on an app.  I highlighted some text (`2+2`), right-clicked, chose preparse, and got\n\n```\nRunning...\n/Users/.../sage-4.4.4-mcbc/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/script: line 14: cd: /tmp/sage-map-app: No such file or directory\nSetting environment variables\n/Users/.../sage-4.4.4-mcbc/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/script: line 18: ./local/bin/sage-env: No such file or directory\n```\nI didn't even know I **had** a Sage app in there!  And in fact, I don't - I just have the usual data/extcode stuff.  This was a surprise.  Yes, I have the correct binary picked for the actual existing Sage app (I used it to test #10556 just now and `which sage` was always what it was supposed to be).\n\nMoving this binary off the Desktop and into Downloads fixed the problem.  Not sure what that was about.  But if you can't even have a command-line Sage somewhere around for this, that's a little different from the other issues we've seen with multiple Sage.app's.\n\n---\n\nTrying the services:\n* Preparse was almost eery.  Seemed to work fine.\n* Trying to *evaluate* `2+3` and replace it:\n\n```\nThe \u201cEvaluate Code in Sage (and replace)\u201d service could not be used because the \u201cSage-click-path-services\u201d application did not provide valid data.\n\nTry using the service differently, or contact the vendor for an updated version of \u201cSage-click-path-services.\u201d\n```\n  Whether the server was on or not did not seem to matter.  Oh wait, I needed to use `print` ... well, maybe that should be even bigger?  Is it possible to detect the word `print`?  Or maybe since we don't really do that with the menu shortcut we don't need to here.  What do you think?\n\n* With trying to get it to execute in a new terminal session:\n\n```\nsage:  arrow2d(headpoint=None, tailpoint=None); exit\n\n'Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF), %Exit, or %Quit to exit without confirmation.'\nsage: \n```\n  Wow!  Where did that come from?  I know that sort of message has been bandied about elsewhere - has that been built in all the time in the app?  I haven't seen it in prior testing, that I recall, though that was a long time ago.  Awesome.  Except for the fact that in this case it doesn't actually exit, since it's inside Sage.  That probably will need a little tweaking.\n\n* As for trying the new worksheet file, this didn't seem to work as well.\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/upload_worksheet?url=file://localhost/var/folders/Yy/YytEJm5VEB0+pBRD7JNLe++++TQ/-Tmp-/sage.fp5w.txt\n```\n  never opened, it just sat like a bump in the browser URL area.\n\n* Uncompressing Sage packages is weird.  It creates the directory, but with a `[space]2` after it.  This also causes problems in compressing.\n* Unpacking spkg command just quits mid-word in the \"preview of command\" popup (I really like this in these things) and there is no scroll bar to indicate it goes on.  You have to pull on the popup window and make it bigger.\n  And then there is this issue.\n\n```\n/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta1-flask/sage --pkg_nc /Users/.../brian-1.2.1.p0 2\n```\n  which clearly isn't going to work, because there is no `brian-1.2.1.p0`, there is only `brian-1.2.1.p0\\ 2`.    Whatever escaping I do, I then get this error message that you shouldn't have weird characters anyway, and then it tells me also that 2.spkg can't be created.\n  And then even when I make a normal thing, I get\n\n```\nCreating Sage package /Users/.../brian-1.2.1.p1\ntar: brian-1.2.1.p1: Cannot stat: No such file or directory\ntar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.\n\nCreated package brian-1.2.1.p1.spkg.\n\n    NAME: brian\n VERSION: 1.2.1.p1\n    SIZE: 0K\n HG REPO: Error reading repository\nSPKG.txt: File is missing\n```\ni.e. this part is broken, because I shouldn't have to think to use it.\n* What sort of files should give the service for testing?  I can't get it for .rst or .py files.  Maybe that's because I don't have Sage as the \"default open\" for such files.  \n  It *does* work for folders.  It *does* work for .sage files.  But you'd think that even for things that weren't default to open in Sage.app, they should still do what I ask.\n\n\n---\n\nOverall, it looks cool.  I certainly now think that Services are useful in general!  Hadn't really tried much before.  But I don't know that these services are quite ready for prime-time yet.",

Awww yeahhhh.  Yup, this works, so you definitely should add this to the instructions.

Unfortunately, apparently it has trouble deciding on an app.  I highlighted some text (`2+2`), right-clicked, chose preparse, and got

```
Running...
/Users/.../sage-4.4.4-mcbc/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/script: line 14: cd: /tmp/sage-map-app: No such file or directory
Setting environment variables
/Users/.../sage-4.4.4-mcbc/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/Resources/script: line 18: ./local/bin/sage-env: No such file or directory
```
I didn't even know I **had** a Sage app in there!  And in fact, I don't - I just have the usual data/extcode stuff.  This was a surprise.  Yes, I have the correct binary picked for the actual existing Sage app (I used it to test #10556 just now and `which sage` was always what it was supposed to be).

Moving this binary off the Desktop and into Downloads fixed the problem.  Not sure what that was about.  But if you can't even have a command-line Sage somewhere around for this, that's a little different from the other issues we've seen with multiple Sage.app's.

---

Trying the services:
* Preparse was almost eery.  Seemed to work fine.
* Trying to *evaluate* `2+3` and replace it:

```
The “Evaluate Code in Sage (and replace)” service could not be used because the “Sage-click-path-services” application did not provide valid data.

Try using the service differently, or contact the vendor for an updated version of “Sage-click-path-services.”
```
  Whether the server was on or not did not seem to matter.  Oh wait, I needed to use `print` ... well, maybe that should be even bigger?  Is it possible to detect the word `print`?  Or maybe since we don't really do that with the menu shortcut we don't need to here.  What do you think?

* With trying to get it to execute in a new terminal session:

```
sage:  arrow2d(headpoint=None, tailpoint=None); exit

'Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF), %Exit, or %Quit to exit without confirmation.'
sage: 
```
  Wow!  Where did that come from?  I know that sort of message has been bandied about elsewhere - has that been built in all the time in the app?  I haven't seen it in prior testing, that I recall, though that was a long time ago.  Awesome.  Except for the fact that in this case it doesn't actually exit, since it's inside Sage.  That probably will need a little tweaking.

* As for trying the new worksheet file, this didn't seem to work as well.

```
http://localhost:8000/upload_worksheet?url=file://localhost/var/folders/Yy/YytEJm5VEB0+pBRD7JNLe++++TQ/-Tmp-/sage.fp5w.txt
```
  never opened, it just sat like a bump in the browser URL area.

* Uncompressing Sage packages is weird.  It creates the directory, but with a `[space]2` after it.  This also causes problems in compressing.
* Unpacking spkg command just quits mid-word in the "preview of command" popup (I really like this in these things) and there is no scroll bar to indicate it goes on.  You have to pull on the popup window and make it bigger.
  And then there is this issue.

```
/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta1-flask/sage --pkg_nc /Users/.../brian-1.2.1.p0 2
```
  which clearly isn't going to work, because there is no `brian-1.2.1.p0`, there is only `brian-1.2.1.p0\ 2`.    Whatever escaping I do, I then get this error message that you shouldn't have weird characters anyway, and then it tells me also that 2.spkg can't be created.
  And then even when I make a normal thing, I get

```
Creating Sage package /Users/.../brian-1.2.1.p1
tar: brian-1.2.1.p1: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.

Created package brian-1.2.1.p1.spkg.

    NAME: brian
 VERSION: 1.2.1.p1
    SIZE: 0K
 HG REPO: Error reading repository
SPKG.txt: File is missing
```
i.e. this part is broken, because I shouldn't have to think to use it.
* What sort of files should give the service for testing?  I can't get it for .rst or .py files.  Maybe that's because I don't have Sage as the "default open" for such files.  
  It *does* work for folders.  It *does* work for .sage files.  But you'd think that even for things that weren't default to open in Sage.app, they should still do what I ask.


---

Overall, it looks cool.  I certainly now think that Services are useful in general!  Hadn't really tried much before.  But I don't know that these services are quite ready for prime-time yet.

You can find all versions of Sage.app on your system with

```
mdfind "kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == 'org.sagemath.Sage'"
```
perhaps that should be documented.  I would like to have some concrete suggestions before I document it though.

Which service? The creating an spkg service?  That should only show up for directories.

Thanks for all the testing, I know it's a thankless job and I'm sorry nothing works.  :-(  I'm not sure when I can get to fixing these since I _really_ need to work on my thesis and they probably aren't simple fixes.
