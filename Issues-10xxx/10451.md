It would be nice to be able to compute the matrices of the diamond bracket operators <d> on spaces of Gamma1 (and GammaH) modular forms. At present this doesn't seem to be implemented.

(Note that this subsumes #10438, which can be closed as duplicate.)

I browsed through the code and the implementation looks good. I still need to think more thoroughly about whether there are any sever consequences when making the diamond operators an element of the Hecke algebra in Sage.

One question: Are there particular reasons why you call the first function in your code diamond_bracket_matrix and not diamond_bracket_operator? After all it's still an element of the Hecke algebra and it has a method .matrix(). In my opinion this might cause confusion.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for looking at this! 

Can you tell me more precisely which function your last comment refers to? I wanted to stick to the convention that functions with "matrix" in the name returned a matrix, and things with "operator" return an element of a Hecke algebra. I can't see anywhere in the patch where this is violated -- can you show me where?
