`spkg/pipestatus` currently uses two different mechanisms, depending on the `bash` version (>=3.0 or not).  Unfortunately, the two alternatives currently differ in behaviour (the consequence in one case being an `install.log` file appearing in the wrong place).

Consider a command

```
pipestatus "A && B" "C"
```

**Alternative 1** (for new versions of bash) does

```sh
A && (B | C)
```
(which is - without regard of the subshell environment - equivalent to the command list without parentheses, i.e. `A && B | C`, since the pipe symbol has higher precedence),


while **alternative 2** (for very old versions of bash) does

```sh
(A && B) | C
```

---

The attached / merged patch makes `pipestatus` behave like **alternative 1** for *all* versions of `bash`, and executes all commands in the *same* environment.

It also patches the top-level `Makefile` to no longer depend on (previously) varying behavior of `pipestatus` by changing a receipt to

```sh
        cd some_dir && pipestatus "A" "B"
```
(where `A` and `B` are simple commands).

Because it is completely inefficient; I would even use `set -o pipefail` in `bash` >= 3.0 directly, and not call scripts.

IMHO Bash 3.0 is old enough to make it a prerequisite anyway.

{{{

( A; echo $? >$EXITSTATUS ) | B
}}}

Back to MS-DOS? ;-)

Someone reading the "documentation":

```
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Run two commands in a pipeline 'CMD1 | CMD2' and exit"
    echo "with the exit status of CMD1, *not* that of CMD2."
    echo "$0 cmd1 cmd2"
    exit
fi
```
would perhaps do:

```sh
pipestatus "(A && B)" "C"
```
but we can add the parentheses in `pipestatus` to get the same behavior in both cases:

Btw, if we change pipestatus, we should also `test $# -eq 2` and give an error otherwise. Such a change was previously rejected just because someone didn't want to touch `pipestatus` or `spkg/install` again.

The patch above fixes that, though it's IMHO a minor issue, because one can easily make the call to `pipestatus` unambiguous.

-1 to this idea, since OS X 10.4 has bash version 2.

The question I posed in the ticket remains: why should there be two cases (the second case should work always, no matter the bash version).

By the way: fixing `eval "$1 | $2"` is easy: `eval "$1" | eval "$2"`.

I don't care about it since it is dead old and only causes problems. If someone is able to build Sage on MacOS X 10.4, Bash 3.x or 4.x should also build, be it an optional Sage package for boot-strapping.

Well, there are people that do care about OS X 10.4. Since (at least) Sage-3.4 till the current Sage-4.6.alpha2, this is an officially supported platform with the regular binary distributions. If Harald (who is able to look at the statistics) tells me nobody downloads these anymore, I'll stop providing them. OTOH, the inclusion of bash as a Sage dependency has been discussed before. (Mainly due to the problems if the system bash is built to use readline as dynamic librariy, and blows up if the readline lib provided by Sage is older, but is found first in the library search path due to the Sage specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings, as e.g. in Arch Linux and younger SuSE distributions.)
But the conclusion was always that we don't want to have bash as a core dependency to be shipped with Sage (be it only for a few OSes).

I've also wasted enough time with trying to find out what's going wrong on some MacOS... ;-)


> Since (at least) Sage-3.4 till the current Sage-4.6.alpha2, this is an officially supported platform with the regular binary distributions.


Time goes by...; I think five years of "active" support are more than one can expect today, and there's no such machine on the build farm, so it is no longer an "officially supported" platform according to what was written on sage-devel.

(Mainly due to the problems if the system bash is built to use readline as dynamic librariy, and blows up if the readline lib provided by Sage is older, but is found first in the library search path due to the Sage specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings, as e.g. in Arch Linux and younger SuSE distributions.)
> But the conclusion was always that we don't want to have bash as a core dependency to be shipped with Sage (be it only for a few OSes).


Making a *specific (minimal) version* mandatory (rather than just requiring Bash, which is the case anyway, i.e. it *is* already a prerequisite) doesn't mean we should ship it with every release. There are other things that could (and IMHO should) be made available differently, like the odd Fortran binaries that are totally useless to everyone not using MacOS X.

So I would for convenience perhaps offer a Bash 3.x or 4.x for MacOS X [10.4], but separate from Sage distributions. I'm pretty sure such packages are already available elsewhere though.

Btw, I don't think a newer `bash` is required in a binary Sage distribution for ordinary use. So just having a newer `bash` on the build system might be sufficient for many people.

That's actually a continued discussion...

> The point is, it is easy to implement something like pipestatus on OS X 10.4 *without* a bash spkg, so what's the problem?


Go ahead. (If it doesn't make worse what we currently have, which is really suboptimal).

But it's obviously the most easiest thing to simply use a useful feature of a shell we already require anyway.

I'd say define a variable name (e.g. `PIPE_STATUS`) for what makes up `pipestatus` and then let `$PIPE_STATUS cmd1 cmd2` either call a Bash-3.0 function (using the `pipefail` shell option) or call a `pipestatus` script, from which we can remove the first case. Of course the second implementation could also be made into a shell function, though more complex.

As mentioned elsewhere, I would also move the logging (`tee`s) from `deps` to `sage-spkg`, which simplifies things.

There are several people building on 10.4 (tiger). It is not as dead as you believe. OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was not released until October 2007. Making life hard for people with computers just over 3 years old is not in my opinion very good. Unlike Linux & Solaris, operating system upgrades are not free for OS X. 

The first release of Solaris 10 (03/2005) slightly predates OS X 10.4 (April 2005), yet comes with bash 3.00.16(1).

IMHO, if we relied less on bashims, and sought advice from places like the autoconf mailing list, or comp.unix.shell, we would do a lot better. Those places tend to have people know know how to write portable shell scripts.

No, that would return 0 if cmd1 fails but not cmd2. So we could do:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

    ...
    if [ ${PIPESTATUS[0]} -ne 0 ]; then
        if [ ${PIPESTATUS[1]} -ne 0 ]; then

    # else returns $?, which is ${PIPESTATUS[1]}

```

Ok, swapping all 0's and 1's in the previous example (but only **with** the `else` part) also works.

Better. :)

Using `eval` twice still behaves different to what you get directly on the command line; we could instead use:

```sh
eval "$1 | $2 ; ecs=(\${PIPESTATUS[*]})"

if [ ${ecs[1]} -ne 0 ]; then
    exit ${ecs[1]}
else
    exit ${ecs[0]}

True.  I have updated the comment.

Consider the following Python analogy:

```
def multiply(a,b):
    return a*b
```

You would not expect `multiply(x+y,z)` to behave like `x+y*z` but you expect it to behave like `(x+y)*z`.

Well, certainly not on what one gets directly at the shell prompt.

> Personally, I wouldn't expect `pipestatus` to behave in a way that the first argument influences the second.  For me, the command line arguments to `pipestatus` are like "blocks" and should not be split.  In other words, I expect

{{{
pipestatus "A && B" "C"
}}}
> to behave like

{{{
(A && B) | (C)
}}}

And I would expect `pipestatus cmd1 cmd2` to behave as what it is intended to replace (for the only reason that the direct syntax isn't supported by dead old bashs on user-friendly OSs):

```
$ set -o pipefail; cmd 1 | cmd2
```

We here have simple textual substitution (or term rewriting like in macros):

```
    pipestatus = lambda cmd1. cmd2: cmd1 | cmd2
```

That's not eager evaluation / call by value, like (analogously) `pipestatus `eval cmd1` `eval cmd2``, or what one would expect from true functions. Of course I would

```C
#define mul(a,b)  ((a)*(b))  /* and not (a*b), which might give contra-intuitive results */
```
but that's a different story (and you certainly know the pitfalls when passing things like `n++` to macros rather than [inline] functions).

In a shell, with a `|` operator, I would expect exactly what the shell (and especially `make`, in our application domain) usually does, namely simple text substitution (and concatenation without bracketing), for perhaps later evaluation. If I want or need parentheses here, I pass them.

And as a side-effect, we get `bash` into the `make` receipt. Rather than writing

```make
target: prereq
        bash -c "cmd1" ; pipestatus "cmd2" "cmd3" ; bash -c "cmd4"
```
we can simply do

```make
target: prereq
        pipestatus "cmd1 ; cmd2" "cmd3 ; cmd4"
```
with the advantage of having the ability to e.g, set environment variables in the first command that take effect in the latter.

Ok, you could also write

```make
target: prereq
        bash -c "cmd1 ; pipestatus cmd2 cmd3 ; cmd4"
```
but then you again get into trouble with quoting.

You refuse to get convinced...

Honestly, I reluctantly gave *a lot* of positive reviews to IMHO bad (to be fair, some of them worse) things recently, like keeping useless baggage in spkgs or leaving definitely *wrong* code like `unset MAKEFLAGS` in because others feared to make changes, in fact corrections, or like introducing new superfluous behavior regarding `SAGE64` (which should be called `SAGE_FORCE_64_BIT_BUILD`, to restate it once more) etc., at the same time having invested into tickets that then wouldn't get merged or again postponed, to next year.

I'll leave the decision to someone else. It's certainly not such an important design decision, but why should I agree on something I still have a different opinion on?

You didn't give an answer to the other aspects I mentioned.

I don't think that's relevant.  If you really need specific `bash` code in your `Makefile`, you better just write a separate shell script.

Well, my approach follows the principle of least astonishment in that it lets `pipestatus` behave as if you issued "`cmd1 | cmd2`" at the shell prompt (with `pipefail` set), where `cmd1` and `cmd2` are meta variables (non-terminals) for arbitrary valid shell commands, sequences of commands etc. included. ;-)

P.S.:

While with my approach one can force the behavoir Jeroen expects (by using parentheses), the opposite is impossible. On the other hand, one *could* of course also do something like

```sh
$ A && pipestatus "B" "C" 
```
to get the behavior of

```sh
$ A && B | C  # same as  pipestatus "A && B" "C"  with my version
```
with Jeroen's version, but that's IMHO odd, at least in Makefiles where we mainly use it (and `A` there would potentially be executed by a *different* shell than the parameters to `pipestatus`, `B` and `C`).

The name of the script (and the current "syntax description") suggests not to use other things than simple commands for each of the two parameters anyway I think.

Don't you think that simply being able to write

```
pipestatus "cd spkg && B" "tee -a logfile"
```
is the most natural solution?  No subshells, no `../`

Finally, perhaps we should simply rename the script and just let it do what we mainly need:

```
tee_output_of_commands <string of commands> <logfile>
```
(where `<logfile>` might also be `"-a some_file"`)

and let it just do the equivalent of

```
set -o pipefail; ( <commands> ) | tee <logfile>

(where in the script `<commands>` would be `eval "$1"` and `<logfile>` would be `$2`, **without** quotes).

Leif, I implemented the patch your way.  Not because I think it is better, but because I think there is a bug to be fixed.  I also rewrote the `Makefile` rule not to assume any particular behaviour for `spkg/pipestatus`.

To bring this (at least the ticket) to an end, **positive review** from me (as I am a co-author / have suggested most of the current changes ;-) ).

It's also clearly better to use an "unambiguous" call of `pipestatus` in the (top-level) `Makefile`. We could still add a note to `pipestatus`' usage message that it behaves as if

```sh
set -o pipefail; CMD1 | CMD2
```
was issued at the shell prompt, as John suggested IIRC.

Until we drop support for Bashs < 3.0 ...

(and/or *generate* the Makefiles, creating "customized" versions depending on the version of the shell found.)

In any case, it's better to not mess around with file descriptors that might already be used (i.e. use Bash's `PIPESTATUS` array instead, since we rely on `bash` anyway).

---

Because `bash` **is** in fact a prerequisite for Sage, I still see no reason for not making a *contemporary* version of it a requirement. If people lacking one are unable to build/install it themselves from the GNU tarball, they can still install pre-built binaries, which AFAIK need not even be provided by Sage as there are already such packages available elsewhere.

I wouldn't consider a shell a battery either, and we *do* care less about older / out-dated releases of *other* operating systems.

The ticket's description should perhaps be updated to reflect the outcome.
