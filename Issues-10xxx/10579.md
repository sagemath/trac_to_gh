`sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.echelon_form()` says

```
       .. note::

           The result is *not* cached.
```

However, the code has

```
        key = 'hnf-%s-%s'%(include_zero_rows,transformation)
        ans = self.fetch(key)
        if ans is not None: return ans
```
