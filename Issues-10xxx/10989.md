A common .desktop file shared among many distros might prove to be useful since right now, you are either forced to create your own, or use someone else's.

A desktop file we are currently using at archlinux is: http://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/plain/sage-mathematics/trunk/SAGE-notebook.desktop

Which could be the one used, or it doesn't have to be. Please let me know if you have any questions.

This commit only provides a .desktop file. Copying it to the right location should be done by the distributions for now, till `make install` leaves experimental state.

It also fixes #16400.

I do not really know much about these desktop files (I do not have a desktop…) but I just stumbled upon this and wondered:
* Is `data/` the default place where something like this should live? (Just asking if it is worth creating a new top-level directory for something like this.)
* Should we also ship an icon since it is mentioned in the desktop file?

Coming from the gnome universe I put it into `data/`, but it shouldn't really matter.

> Should we also ship an icon since it is mentioned in the desktop file?

We should do that.

If we provide these files it will be easier for the user recognize sagemath across various distributions.

P.S. A desktop file is required if we want to ship an appdata file https://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/
