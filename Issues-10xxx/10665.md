This is probably explained by Cremona's comment at #10108:

"I think I can explain this.

To fix this I made sure that the input provided by Sage always has some other stuff appended to it, so mwrank never has insufficient input. But then, the *next* time input is sent to mwrank, there is likely to be still some of that extra stuff in its input buffer. To get around that (I thought) I made sure that mwrank was restarted at every call.

Clearly what I did was insufficient, but this does explain who the order of executing commands does matter."

And there are patches at #10108 which represent a lot of work which have been lying about unused and unmerged just because they are not perfect, even if Sage is better with them than without.
