This is probably explained by Cremona's comment at #10108:

"I think I can explain this. The problem to be solved for this ticket was that if mwrank is given incomplete but otherwise correct input, it just waits for the rest of the input, making Sage appear to hang. To fix this I made sure that the input provided by Sage always has some other stuff appended to it, so mwrank never has insufficient input. But then, the *next* time input is sent to mwrank, there is likely to be still some of that extra stuff in its input buffer. To get around that (I thought) I made sure that mwrank was restarted at every call.

Clearly what I did was insufficient, but this does explain who the order of executing commands does matter."
