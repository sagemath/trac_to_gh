The function `PolynomialRing_field.lagrange_polynomial` sometimes returns an element of the coefficient ring or even a python int instead of an element of the polynomial ring. This can lead to problems if the caller was expecting a polynomial.

```
sage: R, t = FractionField(QQ['t']).objgen(); R.rename('R')
sage: S, x = R['x'].objgen(); S.rename('S')
sage: S.lagrange_polynomial([(2, 3 * t), (4, t + 1)]).parent()
S
sage: S.lagrange_polynomial([(2, 3 * t)]).parent()
R
sage: type(S.lagrange_polynomial([]))
<type 'int'>
```

The return value is a python int if the list of points was empty, an element of the base ring if the list of points had one point, and an element of the polynomial ring if the list of points had more than one point.

There are similar problems with the base case for the `algorithm='neville'` version:

```
sage: S.lagrange_polynomial([(2, 3 * t), (4, t + 1)], algorithm='neville')
[t + 1, (-t + 1/2)*x + 5*t - 1]
sage: [poly.parent() for poly in _]
[R, S]
sage: S.lagrange_polynomial([(2, 3 * t)], algorithm='neville')
[3*t]
sage: [poly.parent() for poly in _]
[R]
sage: S.lagrange_polynomial([], algorithm='neville')
0
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```

Note that in this case, the return value is not even a list when the list of points was empty.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I've put up a patch that should fix the problem, at least in the case of `algorithm='divided_difference'`, and includes a new doctest to verify this.

For the `algorithm='neville'` case, I've taken the liberty of rewriting the code, to clean it up and unify it a bit in addition to fixing the original problem. However:
* This changes the default value of `previous_row` from `None` to `[]`. I doubt this would break anything, but it is a slight change in the function signature.
* In the case of an empty list of points, I wasn't sure whether to return `[]` or `[0]`. The former is more consistent with the `previous_row` option, but the latter preserves the property that the last element of the returned list is the interpolating polynomial (as opposed to non-existent). I opted for the first one, but there's definitely a choice to be made here. (I'll note that neither choice is really backwards-incompatible, since the method used to fail in this case.)

Minh, I've put you on CC, since (I think) you wrote the original code for the `algorithm='neville'` part. Do you approve of the changes?
