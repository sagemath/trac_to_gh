After the changes mentioned in this matplotlib thread get merged into a Sage spkg (maybe matplotlib 1.0.1):

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.matplotlib.general/25400

I think we ought to do a few things to make 2d arrows more precise:

1. Make the join style "miter" so that we have a sharp arrowhead.  To do this, use the path_effects option like in the thread above.

2. Turn off any default shrinking (set shrinkB=0 by default) so that the arrow tip is exactly on the spot specified.

3. Set the cap style to "butt" so that the arrow starts right at the coordinate specified, rather than going over it with a different cap style.
