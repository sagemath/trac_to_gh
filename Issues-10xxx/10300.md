Really?  That's annoying.  I will rewrite the test without any redirections, the test in meant to test whether `sage -sh` actually does something.

I've not got chance to look at this now, but here are a few comments. 

The csh is considered to be a pretty poor shell - see for example this article about it.

http://www.ooblick.com/text/CshProgrammingConsideredHarmful.html

tcsh is based on csh.

The first 150 or so lines of that article covers the issues of output redirection, which is the issue here. 

The newsgroup {{{comp.unix.shell}} or the *autoconf* mailing list are good sources of information. 

Also 

http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/autoconf/Limitations-of-Builtins.html

is worth a look. 

Although this particular test may be re-written without any redirections, the probability of something similar breaking elsewhere mush be high. 

I guess we should create an account using /bin/tcsh as the shell and test the whole of Sage. 

Dave

I created a new account (csh), and set the shell to `/bin/csh`, then built 4.6.1.alpha2 on OpenSolaris 06/2009. 

All tests passed, with the exception of 

```
	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/homology/examples.py # Time out
```

which is due to the fact the tests assumes the experimental homology package is installed, so is a bug in the test suite, rather than a test failure. 

I've not tried the `tcsh` shell yet (I need to install that first). 

I'll try this patch later. I'm going to look at John's SAGE64 patch first.

The following IPython message when it's run for the first time messes up the IPython test:

```
**********************************************************************
Welcome to IPython. I will try to create a personal configuration directory
where you can customize many aspects of IPython's functionality in:

/space/jdemeyer/home/.ipython
Initializing from configuration /mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-4.6.1.alpha3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/UserConfig

Successful installation!

Please read the sections 'Initial Configuration' and 'Quick Tips' in the
IPython manual (there are both HTML and PDF versions supplied with the
distribution) to make sure that your system environment is properly configured
to take advantage of IPython's features.

Important note: the configuration system has changed! The old system is
still in place, but its setting may be partly overridden by the settings in
"~/.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py" config file. Please take a look at the file
if some of the new settings bother you.


Please press <RETURN> to start IPython.
```

The initial `\n` as input should fix this, see the new patch.
