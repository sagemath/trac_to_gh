or here:

Basically, this function ignores the part of the definition that says that an isolated vertex should have an all-zero row and column.

Also, coding things up straight from the definition might make the function faster anyway (rather than multiplying matrices).  If we do need to multiply matrices, I think it would be sufficient to make $D^{1/2}$ have a 1 if the corresponding row represented an isolated vertex.
