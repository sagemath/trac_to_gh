horatio@havelock ~ $ R
/Users/horatio/bin/R: line 212: /lib/R//etc/ldpaths: No such file or directory

This is because on line 31 of the script someone rewrote $R_HOME_DIR in terms of $SAGE_LOCAL. When SAGE_LOCAL is missing from the environment of the running shell, the R script breaks. The fix is to test for empty SAGE_LOCAL before the rewrite.

This is from Sage version 4.6.2.

Does this actually make the problem worse?  The way I read the patch, before one did check for `SAGE_LOCAL` and afterwards one doesn't.  Is this patch backwards?  

I can't do it right now, but I should be able to produce an updated R package within a few days if ahd isn't able to.  

Changing component, since the problem isn't the statistics functionality but rather the way the package is bundled.

Probably backwards from your point of view; since I was only lodging this issue as a courtesy, I just did a diff -u between my version of the R script (which doesn't break when SAGE_LOCAL is undefined) and the version that is in my sage installation (which does).

So the best fix from my point of view is to define SAGE_LOCAL in my .profile and leave you all to do what you want, yes?

Is there a reason why `sage -R` isn't as good of an option?  But yes, for now that would be a workaround for you.  But you are right that we should fix this; no reason for the R to be unusable outside of Sage.

cc:ing the "package maintainers" as well.  R is at 2.12, nearly 2.13, in the meantime, by the way.  Some changes might affect build process - now needs 'popen' and a C99 compiler - if we upgrade.  Probably those are standard, but I don't know if they are or not.

Okay, it turns out that this is done in spkg-install in an interesting way - by calling a Python script called `fix_hardcode`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os

def fix_hardcode(file):
    r = open(file).read().replace('#SAGEHACK#','R_HOME_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/"')
    open(file,'w').write(r)

S = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']
fix_hardcode(S + '/bin/R')
fix_hardcode(S + '/lib/R/bin/R')
```

Which replaces the thing which is actually patched:

```
# HACK for Sage to avoid hardcoding.  NOthing 
# else has been changed in this file.
#R_HOME_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/"  
#SAGEHACK#  
```
Apparently one can't change this part of the file R.sh.in until after configuration and make install?  I think because that file must end up in the binary ahd alludes to.

So we just need to change the hack to 

```
    r = open(file).read().replace('#SAGEHACK#','foo')
```
where foo is a string version of 

```
if test -n "${SAGE_LOCAL}"; then 
   R_HOME_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/"   
fi 
```
But I don't know exactly how one puts multiple lines properly in a shell script of this kind.  I guess it's a Python script, so maybe `\n` would suffice for that?  But of course R.sh.in is not a Python script.

You can use triple quotes in python for multiline strings, so something like this (which is untested) might work:

```python
def fix_hardcode(file):
    r = open(file).read().replace('#SAGEHACK#',
                                  """if test -n "${SAGE_LOCAL}"; then

```json
{
    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nI don't know anything about R, but this looks more complicated to me.  When I look at R.sh.in, right after the #SAGEHACK# part, I see\n\n```\nR_HOME=\"${R_HOME_DIR}\"\nexport R_HOME\nR_SHARE_DIR=\"${R_HOME_DIR}/share\"\nexport R_SHARE_DIR\nR_INCLUDE_DIR=\"${R_HOME_DIR}/include\"\nexport R_INCLUDE_DIR\nR_DOC_DIR=\"${R_HOME_DIR}/doc\"\nexport R_DOC_DIR\n```\nWhen I install the spkg, every instance of `R_HOME_DIR` gets replaced with the hard-coded full path to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R, rather than being kept as R_HOME_DIR.  Doesn't this defeat the purpose #SAGEHACK#?  Won't things go wrong if you move the whole Sage installation?\n\nAnyway, I see the same error \"/lib/R//etc/ldpaths: No such file or directory\" if I run R.  If I apply the patch above, it works on one machine (an Intel Mac running OS X 10.6), but on another (also a mac, same OS) I get an error\n\n```\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Applications/sage/local/lib/R/lib/libR.dylib\n  Reason: image not found\nTrace/BPT trap\n```\nIndeed, libgfortran is not in /usr/local/lib, I think it's only in /Applications/sage/local/lib.\n\nI'll post the patch anyway, in case it helps.

I don't know anything about R, but this looks more complicated to me.  When I look at R.sh.in, right after the #SAGEHACK# part, I see

```
R_HOME="${R_HOME_DIR}"
export R_HOME
R_SHARE_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/share"
export R_SHARE_DIR
R_INCLUDE_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/include"
export R_INCLUDE_DIR
R_DOC_DIR="${R_HOME_DIR}/doc"
export R_DOC_DIR
```
When I install the spkg, every instance of `R_HOME_DIR` gets replaced with the hard-coded full path to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R, rather than being kept as R_HOME_DIR.  Doesn't this defeat the purpose #SAGEHACK#?  Won't things go wrong if you move the whole Sage installation?

Anyway, I see the same error "/lib/R//etc/ldpaths: No such file or directory" if I run R.  If I apply the patch above, it works on one machine (an Intel Mac running OS X 10.6), but on another (also a mac, same OS) I get an error

```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/sage/local/lib/R/lib/libR.dylib
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap
```
Indeed, libgfortran is not in /usr/local/lib, I think it's only in /Applications/sage/local/lib.

I'll post the patch anyway, in case it helps.  New spkg at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/r-2.10.1.p5.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/r-2.10.1.p5.spkg).  If this works, please mark the ticket as "needs review" and add the URL to the ticket description, so the release manager can find it.

IIRC I completely dropped the `fix_hardcode` script, but I'm not sure about whether I'm using `SAGE_LOCAL` or `SAGE_ROOT`; using the latter wouldn't be much better though. ;-)

Replying to [leif](#comment%3A17):
> ... although I think I wasn't expecting someone to run Sage's R from "outside"...


*Thinking a bit more about this:* ;-)

In general, *none* of the "stand-alone" programs like R, the PARI/GP interpreter, Maxima etc. as shipped with and installed by Sage (and almost none of the scripts) in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` are intended to be called directly *from outside the Sage environment*, hence there's also no point in putting this directory into one's `PATH` (i.e., one shouldn't).

Instead, one can do any of the following:

* Start a Sage subshell (`sage --sh`), which then has the full Sage environment set up, and also `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` in its `PATH`, such that running e.g. (Sage's) R by typing simply `R` at the command prompt works.

* Run (e.g.) `sage --R` from any shell to start Sage's R (assuming an instance of `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` is found along one's "global" `PATH`; otherwise `/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/sage --R` or `cd $SAGE_ROOT && ./sage --R`).

* Use the `install_scripts()` function from the `sage:` prompt to create light-weight "shortcut" scripts for all "stand-alone" components (programs) installed by Sage, or one can run it by for example

```sh
$ ./sage -c "install_scripts('$HOME/bin')"
```
   or

```sh
$ sudo ./sage -c "install_scripts('/usr/local/bin')" # needs root privileges
```
  Afterwards, provided that both an instance of `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` is found along and the directory passed to `install_scripts()` is contained in `PATH`, one can start (e.g.) Sage's R again by simply typing `R` from any shell, i.e., *also from "outside the Sage environment"*. 


 *Note: `install_scripts()` currently has a flaw in that the created shortcuts do not support spaces in arguments passed to them; this has been fixed at #11602, which has been merged into Sage 4.7.2.alpha2.*




Nonetheless, I agree that we should at least add a sanity check to e.g. `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/R`, such that it exits with an appropriate error message in case `SAGE_LOCAL` isn't defined (like many scripts already do). I guess such a test is currently missing just because nobody thought of someone trying to call this (and some other scripts) directly, since having them in the `PATH` without a properly set up environment was never intended.

I can (and will perhaps) also make *some* scripts automatically execute themselves in a Sage environment, since this (to me) seems convenient for e.g. `devel/sage/spkg-dist`, but most probably not scripts like `R` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/`, because of the alternatives already present as given above.

---

I'll address the specific issue with the R script(s) at #9668 (*not* #9968 ;-) ), so I've added that ticket as a dependency.

After I've fixed this there (by simply adding a sanity check), this ticket should IMHO be closed as duplicate (not to say *"invalid/won't fix"*).
