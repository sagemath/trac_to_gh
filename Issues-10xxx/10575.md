Magma and Sage let us do this:

```
> R<x,x> := PolynomialRing(RationalField(),2);
> R.1*R.2;
x*x
```

```
sage: R.<x,x> = QQ[]

sage: f = R.0*R.1
sage: f
x*x
sage: magma(f)
x*x
sage: gp(f)
x^2
sage: pari(f)
x^2
sage: singular(f)
x^2

I think that gp(f) should raise an error, since gp can't represent a poly in two variables with the same name.  Magma can fine.

Looks like `R.<x,x> = QQ[]` started throwing an error in `normalize_names` at some point during the past 10 years. I think this can be closed.
