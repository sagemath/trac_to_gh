1.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(1); fh(G)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: empty range for randrange() (0,0, 0)
```

2.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(2); fh(G)
[ Sage just hangs... ]
```

3. Why is there a `G.hamiltonian_cycle()` member function but not `G.hamiltonian_path()`?

See #10205 for some ideas on fixes.

To solve (1), we should probably modify the following two lines:

```python
    #  First we pick a random vertex u
    cdef int x = randint( 0, n-1 )
    cdef int u = vertices[x]
```
to a random choice of a starting *non-isolated* vertex.  I am not a cython specialist, but perhaps we can alter this loop:

```python
    for row in G.adjacency_matrix():
        j = 0
        for k in row:
            if k:
                g.add_arc(i, j)
            j += 1
        i += 1
```
so that a list of non-isolated vertices will be saved. Then we can finish with something like that:

```python
    #  First we pick a random vertex u
    cdef int x = randint(0, len(non_isolated_vertices) - 1)
    cdef int u = non_isolated_vertices[x]
```

If the graph is empty, I suggest we raise an informative exception (see also #21741).

If there is not empty but has no edges, we may either raise an exception or return something like `(False, [0])` (in the case where we're looking for a cycle, or if we're looking for a path and there are at least two vertices in the graph), or `(True, [0])` (in the case where we're looking for a path and the graph contains a single vertex).

Apparently `sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(2); fh(G)` will not end, while `sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3); fh(G)` returns an immediate answer.

I pushed a patch fixing some of the issues of the `find_hamiltonian` method.

To do so, I have split the method in two parts: a front end testing small cases and partitioning the graph into connected components, and a method working on a connected graph with at least 3 vertices.

The problem with vertices of degree 1 remains, but I have no solution yet.

Some comments (not a through review):

- Do not use `assert` to check for input. For bad input, raise the appropriate error (likely a `ValueError`).
- Same thing when there is no Hamiltonian path.
- Fundamentally, I believe this should return `None` if there is no such path and not raise an error.

At least the `backtrack` for `hamiltonian_cycle` returns `False`, but with something more for debugging than anything (i.e., it is not a certificate).
- Use `r"""` so you can do `\times` instead of `\\times`.
- The `algorithm` bullet points should be aligned with the rest of the text in that input point; in other words, remove 4 spaces from those lines.
- You should tell Cython that `i` and `j` are `int`s and add back in `cdef int i,j`.

Right. I'm now using `EmptySetError` like `hamiltonian_cycle`.

If we want to change the outpus, we have to do it for both methods and it's better to do it in another ticket.

Thank you. I didn't know the meaning of `r"""`.
