To solve (1), we should probably modify the following two lines:

```python
    #  First we pick a random vertex u
    cdef int x = randint( 0, n-1 )
    cdef int u = vertices[x]
```
to a random choice of a starting *non-isolated* vertex.  I am not a cython specialist, but perhaps we can alter this loop:

```python
    for row in G.adjacency_matrix():
        j = 0
        for k in row:
            if k:
                g.add_arc(i, j)
            j += 1
        i += 1
```
so that a list of non-isolated vertices will be saved. Then we can finish with something like that:

```python
    #  First we pick a random vertex u
    cdef int x = randint(0, len(non_isolated_vertices) - 1)
    cdef int u = non_isolated_vertices[x]
```

If the graph is empty, I suggest we raise an informative exception (see also #21741).

If there is not empty but has no edges, we may either raise an exception or return something like `(False, [0])` (in the case where we're looking for a cycle, or if we're looking for a path and there are at least two vertices in the graph), or `(True, [0])` (in the case where we're looking for a path and the graph contains a single vertex).

The easiest is to treat small cases, with 0, 1 or 2 nodes.

Apparently `sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(2); fh(G)` will not end, while `sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3); fh(G)` returns an immediate answer.

I pushed a patch fixing some of the issues of the `find_hamiltonian` method.

To do so, I have split the method in two parts: a front end testing small cases and partitioning the graph into connected components, and a method working on a connected graph with at least 3 vertices.

The problem with vertices of degree 1 remains, but I have no solution yet.

I did the following in last commit:

So the 3 issues are fixed with this patch. One issue remains with method `find_hamiltonian` that may run forever if the graph has some vertices of degree one (it was already clearly indicated in a warning). I propose to let this problem for another ticket. Already enough to review.

Some comments (not a through review):

- Do not use `assert` to check for input. For bad input, raise the appropriate error (likely a `ValueError`).
- Same thing when there is no Hamiltonian path.
- Fundamentally, I believe this should return `None` if there is no such path and not raise an error. I was going to say this is consistent with `hamiltonian_cycle`, but that behavior depends on which algorithm you use! At least the `backtrack` for `hamiltonian_cycle` returns `False`, but with something more for debugging than anything (i.e., it is not a certificate).
- Use `r"""` so you can do `\times` instead of `\\times`.
- The `algorithm` bullet points should be aligned with the rest of the text in that input point; in other words, remove 4 spaces from those lines.
- You should tell Cython that `i` and `j` are `int`s and add back in `cdef int i,j`.

Right. I'm now using `EmptySetError` like `hamiltonian_cycle`.

done

I was going to say this is consistent with `hamiltonian_cycle`, but that behavior depends on which algorithm you use!

If we want to change the outpus, we have to do it for both methods and it's better to do it in another ticket.

> - Use `r"""` so you can do `\times` instead of `\\times`.
 
Thank you. I didn't know the meaning of `r"""`. 

> - The `algorithm` bullet points should be aligned with the rest of the text in that input point; in other words, remove 4 spaces from those lines.
 
ok
> - You should tell Cython that `i` and `j` are `int`s and add back in `cdef int i,j`.
 
ok
