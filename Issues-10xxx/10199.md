If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to

Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables

When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the

I'd tend to agree, though it doesn't mean there *isn't* a bug :)  If this was a new post, I'd post to sage-support in the hopes of attracting attention, but if this is six months old there isn't much point.

Putting as 'positive review' for Jeroen.
