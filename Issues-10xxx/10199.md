sage: An error occurred while installing cvxopt-0.9.p9
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /home/pub/local/sage-4.6/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/home/pub/local/sage-4.6/spkg/build/cvxopt-0.9.p9 and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/home/pub/local/sage-4.6/spkg/build/cvxopt-0.9.p9' && '/home/pub/local/sage-4.6/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.
