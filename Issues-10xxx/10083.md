## The problem

As reported at #9995, the python package initially failed to build at all, as Python's configure script thought the compiler was broken. Once that was sorted out, Python built, but failed to install due to this error:


```
Sleeping for three seconds before testing python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named math
math module failed to import

real    37m23.968s
user    34m46.809s
sys     6m19.683s
sage: An error occurred while installing python-2.6.4.p10
```

When I look at build log for Python (attached), I see a rather large number of modules actually failed to build, so `math` is not the only one, but it is one which causes Sage to fail to build. 

```
Failed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:
_bsddb             _curses_panel      _hashlib
_ssl               bsddb185           gdbm
linuxaudiodev      ossaudiodev        spwd
sunaudiodev
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

```

Strangely enough, despite these modules not building, a large number of packages in Sage that require python would actually build on AIX. 

Since AIX is low on the priority list, I will not spend much time on this yet, until the 64-bit Solaris and OpenSolaris ports are complete. 

I will investigate this more later, and report any problems upstream if they are needed. It might be something quite simple that's causing a lot of modules to fail to build on AIX.

Install log for Python. This is based on a patched python package, which gets around the problem at #9995. This package is not yet part of Sage.
