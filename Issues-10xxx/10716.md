The patch I have uploaded uses Sage methods to iterate through all monomials of the polynomial, calculating each one's weighted degree, and selects the maximal of these.

I just uploaded a new patch which makes it possible not to specify the weights in a tuple. That was pretty silly with the old patch, where you would have to write something like

```
  Q.weighted_degree((1, 2))
```
Now you can omit the double-parenthesis, but also use the previous calls:

```
  Q.weighted_degree(1, 2)
  Q.weighted_degree((1, 2))
  Q.weighted_degree({x:1, y:2})
```

<a id='comment:9'></a>Is there a reason you convert everything to vectors & use a dot_product? Seeing the concerns about performance -- is type conversion less expensive than calling prod() or something similar? I don't know about Cython, but my impression is that in some languages it would be more efficient to assume you have an iterable & just iterate.

FWIW, this functionality is available in Sage 4.7:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(7)[]
sage: p = x^3 + y + x*z^2
sage: p.degree()
3
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(7),'x,y,z',
....: order=TermOrder(matrix([1,4,2,1,1,0,1,0,0])))
sage: q = P(p)
sage: q.degree()
4
```
The relevant code is in sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx, where singular_polynomial_deg manually changes the ring of `p` if it isn't equal to ring it has at first.

I propose an alternative patch. It implements the weighted degree for all MPolynomial, not just Singular ones. It is also faster than the original patch. I think that, in general, it is better to use a polynomial ring with weighted degree if one is really interested so I have added a hint in the documentation.

<a id='comment:19'></a>```python
if self.is_zero():
  #Corner case, note that the degree of zero is a python int
  return -1
```

Why not fix the bug?

```python
weigths = map(int, weights)
```

Why `int` and not `ZZ`?


```python
cdef int deg = -1
cdef int n = self.parent().ngens()
cdef int i, l
```

This is sets you up for integer overflows, why not avoid them by using `ZZ`?  The function is going to be slow in any case.

Also, doesn't Singular have an internal function which would allow to calculate this?

Is "weights" supposed to be misspelled as "weigths"? Notice that this is a change from an earlier spelling.

Also, Singular doesn't accepted anything larger than 32-bit integers (confirmed w/Singular developer the other day). Will this change be practically useful?

This patch is intended for arbitrary polynomials, I am not aware non-Singular degrees that admits such large exponents, bur someone might want to create one. Even if the degree of the polynomial is smaller than 32-bit the weighted degree might be.

I have not a strong opinion on this issue and taking an int would probably be safe for most users.

<a id='comment:29'></a>The conversion is the other way around, from int to Integer. You are right that there is a performance penalty. I do not have the numbers at hand right now but I will look at it and check if there is a more clever way.

The method is not cached in any way, the degree is computed any time that the method is called.

If the user want to use a ring that is mapped to singular as is worried about performance, because it will call the method a lot of times or over huge polynomials, the recommendation in the documentation is to create a ring with that term order and then just call degree inside that ring. It will be orders of magnitude faster. That is, this method is intended to use for a weighted degree different from the one in the base ring.

I have found further problems with the patch:

<a id='comment:35'></a>Do you mean comparing the cost of weighted_degree with addition/multiplication? That depends *a lot* on the underlying ring. Do you have a specific ring in mind?

This patch will have absolutely not impact on addition and mult. I expect that addition can be in fact faster that weighted degree for "nice" rings and multiplication will be much slower.

I mean comparing the cost of, say, addition in a ring with Integer weighted orders vs. addition in a ring with int weighted orders. Use the same polynomials in the same base field. Then try with multiplication.

I have no particular ring in mind; I'm curious about all the "usual" rings: QQ[**x**], **F**<sub>*p*</sub>[**x**], etc.

Why?

<a id='comment:37'></a>This patch will have no effect on that. There are no rings with int weighted order or Integer weighted order.

When you create a multivariate polynomial ring, you select a TermOrder, with degrevlex as default.

However, in some cases, a user may want to compute the degree of a polynomial with a weighted term order that is *different* from the term order of the underlying ring. In this, and only in this case the weighted_degree method will play a role. In `QQ['x,y']` and `GF(p)['x,y']` singular will be used, so for usual operations of addition and multiplication will use the singular implementation of term orders. This patch will not change that.

```
sage: K=PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a,b,c', order=TermOrder('wdeglex',(7,8,9)))
sage: a,b,c=K.gens()
sage: f = a+b**3+c**4
sage: f.degree() # uses the weights of K, it is singular who compute this.
36
sage: f.weighted_degree([7,8,9]) #My patch, not computed using singular.
36
sage: f.weighted_degree([1,3,-3]) #My patch, not computed using singular.
9
sage: #The term order of the underlying ring does not change.
sage: f.parent().term_order()
Weighted degree lexicographic term order with weights (7, 8, 9)
```

Right. I get that. I didn't realize how `weighted_degree` was being used. I get that now.

Not at first, but eventually :-) After that, the highlighted box is very appealing to click on, but doesn't give information. You have to click on *completely plain text* to get a diff.

But even that isn't right. The diff I get is a diff from previous work on this ticket, not from pre-ticket source. Is it possible to see the cumulative result of all the changes, just as we used to recommend on simpler tickets that someone combine all the tickets into one?

Hmm, now *git* doesn't know what that means.

<a id='comment:55'></a>OK, I can now see the entire set of changes in one go (yay!) although I'm troubled by the branch being changed. I'm changing the status back to `Needs review` for the time being.

1. Is that a problem?
2. Should I worry about doctests that have no obvious relation to this ticket? I'm getting failures in doctests like `f.resultant(g) == fh.macaulay_resultant(gh)`. I'm thinking those are caused by other tickets that have been worked into this branch for some mysterious reason (i.e., all those deleted lines I was seeing earlier).

Great, so not only am I waiting a long time to rebuild (contra "This should be quite fast" on the developer guide), I'm looking at the wrong thing. Alright, once it's ready, I'll move to sage-release.

Is there a faster way to do this? In the old system, I downloaded the ticket, checked it, gave it a positive review, done. Now it seems the entire system has to rebuild for just a few lines of code. Surely I'm doing something wrong.

Fast for whom? In the old system, I'd either have given this a positive review, or have confirmed within a matter of minutes (at most) that the doctest failures were due to this ticket, & marked it `Needs work`. Simple, fast, efficient.

In the new system, **I'm still waiting for sage to finish building, half an hour after invoking `sage -br`.** I'm pretty sure I'll be waiting at least that much longer -- yet in order to verify the cause of the failing doctests, I still have to checkout `sage-release` and go through that.

Was I supposed to checkout sage-release before checking out the ticket? Am I supposed to do that before every ticket I referee? I don't see how this is an improvement. That's why I say, "Surely I'm doing something wrong."
