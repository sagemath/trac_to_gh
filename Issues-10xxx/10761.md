Numerical approximation works for complex numbers:

```
sage: n(1 + I)
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
sage: (1 + I).n()
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I
```

but not for algebraic numbers:

```
sage: m = matrix(3, [3,1,6,5,2,9,7,3,13])
sage: E = m.eigenvalues()
sage: E
[18.16815365088822?, -0.08407682544410650? - 0.2190261484802906?*I, -0.08407682544410650? + 0.2190261484802906?*I]
sage: map(type, E)
[<class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>, <class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>, <class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>]
sage: map(n, E)

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The patch provides a short and sweet fix to the above problem. The issue arises in sage/misc/functional.py's numerical_approx() function:

```
if not (is_ComplexNumber(x) or is_ComplexDoubleElement(x)):
            try:
                return sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField(prec)(x)                                                                              
            except TypeError:
                pass
        return sage.rings.complex_field.ComplexField(prec)(x)
```
Attempting to call RealField() on a complex AlgebraicNumber raises a ValueError and not a TypeError, so the exception is not caught. Changing the except clause to catch all errors fixes this:

```
if not (is_ComplexNumber(x) or is_ComplexDoubleElement(x)):
            try:
                return sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField(prec)(x)
            # Trac 10761: now catches all errors (instead of just                                                 
            # a TypeError), since calling RealField on AlgebraicNumbers                                           
            # can raise a ValueError                                                                              
            except:
                pass
        return sage.rings.complex_field.ComplexField(prec)(x)
```

Hi Simon,

This will be *very* useful, thanks for digging it up.  Three comments:

1.  `type(E[1])` would be more accurate (and readable) as `E[1].parent()`, more Sage-like.

2. I write lots of "naked" except clauses, which I think is a bad practice.  Is this a place where could just add `", Value Error"` after the `TypeError`?

3.  Style Points:  I think three lines of source comments for this fix is more than you would normally see.  With the Trac number in the docstring, and a patch on Trac, you don't need to say so much.  With one line here, it'd warn anybody away from messing with it.

Passes all long tests right now.

Rob

Hi Rob

On the issues you've raised:

1) `type(E[1])` changed to `E[1].parent()` in the example as per your suggestion.

2) Regarding the naked except clause, I tried to add a catch of `ValueError`, but the function was still breaking. I wasn't able to figure out why, which is why I defaulted to catching everything. I figured this was okay, though, since this was just one part of a multistep coercion attempt - and thus errors are to be expected. Thoughts?

3) Inline comment streamlined to a single line.

Simon,

Looks real good.  If the precise error list does not do the trick, then I think leaving it empty is fine.

Applies and builds, passes tests, docs build and look good.  Positive review.

I was going to ask the same, but kini beated me.

I also was going to suggest this if the tuple didn't work :

```
except TypeError:
    pass
except ValueError:
    pass
```

but I think what kini proposes is best. No?

Did you do something like this?

```python
except TypeError, ValueError:

This will attempt to catch TypeError exceptions and assign them to the variable name ValueError. It's [a deprecated behavior](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10761#SECTION0010300000000000000000) from old versions of Python.
