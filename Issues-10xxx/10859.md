In order to get more information out of symbolic expressions, I added `is_series()` and `is_terminating_series()` methods. This is really necessary if you want to write functions that accept symbolic series as input. 

I also noticed that there are various methods `_is_something()`, which would likewise be useful but are not "public" because of the leading underscore. The second patch removes the leading underscore from them to make them part of the public API.

1) GiNac has a special operand for series, and `is_series()` returns true if and only if the expression is a series in this sense. The output will include an `Order()` term. Maxima does not have an order term as far as I know:

```
sage: maxima(sin(x)).taylor(maxima(x), 0, 10)
x-x^3/6+x^5/120-x^7/5040+x^9/362880
```
so converting maxima series to the symbolic ring necessarily creates ordinary polynomials. 

2) Laurent series are included:

```
sage: (cos(x)/x).series(x,10)
1*x^(-1) + (-1/2)*x + 1/24*x^3 + (-1/720)*x^5 + 1/40320*x^7 + (-1/3628800)*x^9 + Order(x^10)
sage: _.is_series()
True
```

3) I think removing the underscores from other `is_something()` is in the spirit of this ticket of exposing more introspection capabilities to the user. I don't think there is any argument to be made that the user must not be able to access these functions. Rather, it adds obvious functionality to the public API.

I'll fix some english language typos and upload a revised version.

I agree that these functions should be exposed to the user. I was the one to add them with an underscore in the first place, with the thought that they are only useful if you want to get into the internals of symbolic expressions. But anybody who wants to do any serious programming with symbolics needs them. They should be more visible.

I also appreciate any effort to clean up the public API of symbolic expressions. This has been a mess for a long time. AFAIK, it was written to expose some basic maxima functionality initially, then somehow it was decided to keep this old interface and not use the (much better designed) ginac one.

I am not a fan of the deprecation policy either, but I have been advertising those functions for a while ![1] and in this case it is not so much trouble to deprecate them.

![1] http://wiki.sagemath.org/symbolics/rewrite?action=AttachFile (which should be attached to a trac ticket)

You just need to do `_is_something = deprecated_function_alias(is_something, 'Sage 4.7.1')` for each function. `deprecated_function_alias` is in `sage.misc.misc`.
