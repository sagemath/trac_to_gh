In order to get more information out of symbolic expressions, I added `is_series()` and `is_terminating_series()` methods. This is really necessary if you want to write functions that accept symbolic series as input. 

I also noticed that there are various methods `_is_something()`, which would likewise be useful but are not "public" because of the leading underscore. The second patch removes the leading underscore from them to make them part of the public API.

A few comments/questions:
* Are there any other symbolic objects that would look like series but not be caught by this?  (For instance, ones gotten by doing `SR(some Maxima thing that returns a series)`.)  I guess I'm wondering if this is only supposed to find things created by `.series()` or if it's supposed to catch anything that's a series.  
* Does this include Laurent series?
* There are a couple weird typos, including <code>via the :meth:\`series\` method.a </code>

* I think that the second patch should be part of a separate ticket.  Presumably someone thought it was good for the methods to be hidden, so it would be helpful to know why that is.
* Should we maybe even discuss whether these new methods should be underscored?

I apologize for not having time to give this a proper review, though on a cursory examination it looks fine in terms of the actual code and tests.

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
1) GiNac has a special operand for series, and `is_series()` returns true if and only if the expression is a series in this sense. The output will include an `Order()` term. Maxima does not have an order term as far as I know:

```
sage: maxima(sin(x)).taylor(maxima(x), 0, 10)
x-x^3/6+x^5/120-x^7/5040+x^9/362880
```
so converting maxima series to the symbolic ring necessarily creates ordinary polynomials. 

2) Laurent series are included:

```
sage: (cos(x)/x).series(x,10)
1*x^(-1) + (-1/2)*x + 1/24*x^3 + (-1/720)*x^5 + 1/40320*x^7 + (-1/3628800)*x^9 + Order(x^10)
sage: _.is_series()
True
```

3) I think removing the underscores from other `is_something()` is in the spirit of this ticket of exposing more introspection capabilities to the user. I don't think there is any argument to be made that the user must not be able to access these functions. Rather, it adds obvious functionality to the public API.

I'll fix some english language typos and upload a revised version.

I am not a fan of the deprecation policy either, but I have been advertising those functions for a while ![1] and in this case it is not so much trouble to deprecate them.

![1] http://wiki.sagemath.org/symbolics/rewrite?action=AttachFile (which should be attached to a trac ticket)

You just need to do `_is_something = deprecated_function_alias(is_something, 'Sage 4.7.1')` for each function. `deprecated_function_alias` is in `sage.misc.misc`.
