Probably something has changed in roots(algorithm='numpy') between 4.6.alpha1 and 4.6.alpha2.
Was numpy upgraded? Is the 4.6.alpha2 source available somewhere?

Maybe it is a problem in NumPy, maybe in the conversion between RealField and the NumPy types.

Note the difference is only by one unit in last place between the "got" and "expected" values,
thus it might be a conversion error too.

I've not looked at this code, but is this only using machine precision? (That's what the numPy message semi-implies). If so, why is there any surprise this acts differently on different machines? Perhaps I've missed the point of this.

if the code is only using basic arithmetic operations and the square root, which is what it should
do to solve `x^2-pi` (which is what the failing test does) the behaviour should not depend on
the machine used, since those operations are standardized by IEEE 754.

But the maths library is not standardised by IEEE 754. It's known for example that exp(1.0) gives a different answer on SPARC to x86. 

That said, the fact the answers should be sqrt(pi) and -sqrt(pi), one might hope that one gets the same magnitude I must admit. 

I just created a noddy C program on my OpenSolaris machine where this failed. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

volatile double x=M_PI;
int main() {
    printf ("%.70lf\n",sqrt(x));
}

drkirkby@hawk:~$ gcc -lm test.c
drkirkby@hawk:~$ ./a.out

What I meant by "where this failed" was that the C program was compiled and built on the same computer on which the Sage doctest failed. 

I realise that the result I got from the noddy C program was the same as was expected in the Sage doctest. 

I don't have the time to investigate this.

thank you Karl-Dieter for your help. It is much appreciated. On my computer I get more digits
if I print elements of `ext_rts1` separately:

```
sage: ext_rts1[0]
-1.7724538509055159
sage: ext_rts1[1]
1.7724538509055159
```
which shows that they are exactly opposite:

```
sage: ext_rts1[0]+ext_rts1[1]
0.0
```
Similarly I get:

```
sage: rts[0]
-1.77245385091
sage: rts[1]
1.77245385091
sage: rts[0]+rts[1]
0
```
What do you get for the above commands?

Does anybody know how to report the problem upstream? The numpy SPKG.txt file says that

Dave kindly opened an account for me on his computer. I did investigate: the problem lies in
the eigvals routine from numpy, which itself calls the dgeev routine from lapack. I am stuck there,
since the dgeev routine is quite complex. Again, the maintainers of the lapack spkg are Josh Kantor
and William.

I get the same problem with the new numpy package, although I didn't do `./sage -ba` since it would take forever... I don't think that matters, though, since

```
sage: numpy.version.version
'1.5.0'
```
so it's using the new one. 

You may want to email sage-devel on this one to ask who would be checking up on lapack upstream; I don't know, since William has a lot of other things going on and is often a 'default' spkg maintainer, and I'm not sure Kantor has been active much (HISTORY.txt on the website indicates his last 'contribution' in terms of refereeing or code was about a year ago).

Paul, 

I have **NOT** reported this upstream. I reported another Numpy issue to the Numpy list, and gave a link to where to post bug reports, but I have not done this one. It would be better if someone who understands the bug better does that.

Umm... help me out here.

So, shouldn't that make an array of zeros?  

Also, when I do `results`, the output is not really helpful to me.  Is this supposed to create the array you mention above in place of `wr`?  I'm sorry if I'm missing something obvious.

Okay, so one does want something other than the zeros.  Thanks for clarifying that.

But I have to say, I don't even get anything different on my OS X 10.6 Mac, yet it gets the right roots

It must be something related to the Sage-NumPy interface. Someone more fluent with NumPy should
look at this. Otherwise I will try to investigate more next week.

I'm not sure that achieves anything useful. Sure the doctest will pass, but it might actually delay the urgency given to fixing the underlying problem. A successful test is one that has uncovered a previously unknown error. This tests has done that. I don't personally think it's appropriate to water down the test just to get 100% passes.  

I suggested some time ago we should have a page on a wiki which documents known issues with a release - either before or after the release is made. 

e.g I started this, though it's not been updated

http://wiki.sagemath.org/errata

I think it would be better to document the problem rather than temporarily hide it.

If I'm not mistaken, the systems which are showing this problem are all 32-bit builds. 
* 'fulvia', the Solaris 10 x86 system is using a 32-bit version of Sage, despite the hardware is 64-bit
* 'hawk', my own personal OpenSolaris machine is using a 32-bit version of Sage, despite the hardware is 64-bit 
* Cicero is a 32-bit Linux system - see http://wiki.sagemath.org/skynet
* Georg Weber's MAC is 32-bit.

Are there any counter examples? I believe John has built Sage on 'mark2' without the failure. Although that's a 64-bit system, the binary is only 32-bit. 

From what I understand, sqrt() should be the same on any IEEE 754 system. However, the same is not true for pow(). It seems unlikely but perhaps one root is being computed using sqrt(x) and the other pow(x,0.5). Mathematically they are equal, but perhaps not on a computer with a finite number of bits. 

Since pi is irrational, this will never be able to be computed exactly using floating point maths.

Since Paul pointed out that there is some linear algorithm going on here from deep within numpy, it seems unlikely that this is what is going on.

yes it seems the computation is done by the lapack `dgeev` routine. From the source file
`dgeev.f` in the Sage distribution, it does not call `POW` however it calls `SQRT`. But the square root is a
standard IEEE function. What could happen however is that on some machines lapack could use
double extended precision (i.e., 64-bit instead of 53-bit significand).

One way to debug this is to add print statements in the `dgeev.f` file, recompile lapack and see the difference between two different computers. How can one (easily) recompile and build a
spkg (I guess `sage -br` will not do that)?

Well. I've created a new lapack package, which I've built on my OpenSolaris machine. 

I notice it can build 4 libraries, but it looks like Sage is only building one of them. There's this bit of code in one of the files. I've no idea what they all might do, though.

```
LAPACKLIB    = lapack$(PLAT).a
TMGLIB       = tmglib$(PLAT).a
EIGSRCLIB    = eigsrc$(PLAT).a
LINSRCLIB    = linsrc$(PLAT).a
```

Perhaps it would be wise if we just run "make" and installed the default libraries, rather than a subset of them. The total build time of the lapack library is quite modest:

```
real	0m13.445s
user	1m7.550s
sys	0m26.048s
Successfully installed lapack-3.2.2
```

(that's on a quad core 3.33 GHz Hyperthreaded Xeon, so it would obviously take more/less time on slower/faster hardware. It would not doubt take longer to build all 4 libraries too). But having a partial installation might not be such a good idea and would no doubt make running tests more difficult. (Of course, there's no `spkg-check` file in lapack package in Sage. Testing code is a very low priority.) 


I've put a **temporary** copy of the lapack package (md5 checksum `521afc0c5b1fde0a0159c4770b0e173e`)  at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/crap/lapack-3.2.2.spkg

This has is just hacked together at this point. There's no Mecurial repository (I deleted the other as it looked pretty useless), `SPKG.txt` is a mess, there's no `spkg-check`, not spell checked, .... etc etc. BUT perhaps someone else can try it. Sage built ok on my OpenSolaris machine with this and it's just building the documentation I as write. I'll clean up the package at some point, but some can try if they want.

I'm busy until at least Wednesday of next week (20th October), so will not be spending much time on Sage. 

Updating the version of Lapack (#10123) is more complex than I thought it would be, and I don't have time to complete this. Libraries are called foobar.a and not libfoobar.a. This causes issues with both the packages self-tests and Sage doctests. So the package I created is effectively useless and will remain so unless I work on it more. 

IIRC, I did manage to get this doc test to run, and it still failed, so the Lapack upgrade will not fix this. However, it's hard to report bugs upstream when we are running 3 year old versions of packages, so I think updating Lapack is necessary before we report this upstream. 

So it would be good if someone could review John's cleaned up Lapack at #10121, and not wait for me to produce a new version of Lapack. 

It would be good if someone could write a few doc tests broadly similar to this one, to ensure that under some other conditions the Numpy errors does not become totally unacceptable. 

Having thought it more, I think Paul Zimmerma's suggestion to use the dots to make this pass might be sensible, as from a practical point of view, such a small error is not really a problem. There does appear to be a bug, but there are a lot more serious bugs in Sage that are not blockers. 

For example, if one runs the Maxima self-tests, several fail with small numerical issues with ECL but pass with other Lisp interpreters. One of the Maxima developers has said he think ECL is "off by one bit in places". Of course, the fact we don't run the Maxima self-tests as part of Sage means we don't see this. 

Many testing frameworks for software have several categories for failures, which include

* Expected to fail and did fail

Yes, the difference is caused by LAPACK, not NumPy (see below).

I'm not sure but I doubt PPCs have (Intels!) extended double precision, i.e. `-mfpmath=sse` vs. `-mfpmath=387` doesn't hold there. (But IBM uses other floating-point formats beyond 64-bit double precision.)


> One way to debug this is to add print statements in the `dgeev.f` file, recompile lapack and see the difference between two different computers. How can one (easily) recompile and build a spkg (I guess `sage -br` will not do that)?


For hacking the Fortran code (avoiding to create new LAPACK spkgs), it is sufficient to extract the corresponding files (e.g. `dgeev.f`) from the spkg and put modified versions into the [static] LAPACK library, which is `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/liblapack.a`, and to afterwards rebuild / reinstall the NumPy spkg, which links this library into its dynamic ones.

Assuming one has copied `lapack-20071123.p1/src/SRC/dgeev.f` to `$SAGE_ROOT`, one can do e.g. the following to include a modified version:

```sh
~/sage-x.y.z$ gfortran -fPIC -c dgeev.f                     # or sage_fortran -c dgeev.f
~/sage-x.y.z$ ar rs local/lib/liblapack.a dgeev.o           # "s" saves running ranlib separately
~/sage-x.y.z$ ./sage -f spkg/standard/numpy-1.3.0.p4.spkg   # force reinstallation
```
and then run Sage.

(Dave: I've *not* verified if the "s" option is POSIX... ;-) The `ar` command above is just a short-cut for

```sh
~/sage-x.y.z$ ar r local/lib/liblapack.a dgeev.o   # replace the existing dgeev module
~/sage-x.y.z$ ranlib local/lib/liblapack.a         # rebuild the symbol table
```
)

On a 32-bit Pentium4 (Prescott) and a 64-bit Core2 I get, respectively:

```

(The machine parameters queried by LAPACK's `DLAMCH()` are identical; the chosen precision / format for the `PRINT` statements, `D35.25`, should be sufficient.)

What about (temporarily?) tagging the doctest result(s) with `# 32-bit` / `# 64-bit`? (It seems the results are identical on **all** 32-bit platforms...?) 

I've not yet tracked this down further (perhaps someone more knowledgeable of LAPACK / Fortran can do this), nor have I tried the more recent LAPACK version.

The dgeev.f from the canonical place:
http://www.netlib.org/lapack/double/dgeev.f
does not differ from what we have in lapack spkg.
So I doubt that a "more recent version" (well, this one is Fortran VI, no joke...)
would provide a fix. 

It looks to me more of a compiler bug than Lapack bug...
Well, I used to know enough fortran to be able to dig this; 
I wonder how one can get hold of a non-gcc-based fortran compiler for one of platforms we have this

`dgeev` calls many other modules...

I was thinking of GCC built-ins, too.

Sun's Fortran compiler on e.g. t2.math? Perhaps Dave also has an IBM (AIX) or HP[-UX] Fortran compiler.

Btw, on Linux, I have a couple of LAPACK library versions, including "3gf" ("gf" for GNU's gfortran).

unfortunately this does not help on MacOSX 10.5 PPC.
I tried to recompile lapack with extra "-fdefault-double-8 -fdefault-real-8" options put into sage_fortran, to no avail.
One cannot add -fdefault-double-8 option alone, as the compiler (gfortran 4.2.1) 
says that -fdefault-real-8 is required along with it.
And -fdefault-real-8 alone produces code that does not work.

The next attempt will be with "-fdefault-real-8  -mlong-double-128  -lmx"...

`t2.math` is in rather a mess now, following William deleting all the NFS file system that were shared to `t2.math`. 

I'll create Dima an account on my OpenSolaris machine. The problem exists on that. I can't say for sure whether it does on my AIX server (PowerPC) or HP-UX workstation (PA-RISC CPU).

Leave that with me.

We are computing the roots of f(x)=x**2-Pi by computing the eigenvalues of the matrix 

```
[[0.0, Pi], 
[1.0, 0.0]]
```
 We call LAPACK's DGEEV that does just that, by a relatively nontrivial iterative procedure, The stopping condition is related to the precision guaranteed by LAPACK, and it turns out, on some floating point architectures, that the error in computing the negative root is very close to the precision guaranteed by LAPACK: A test program that calls DGEEV on this matrix, on MacOSX 10.5 (PPC G4) outputs:

```
Eigenvalue( 1) =  1.77245385090551588191942755656782538E+00
Eigenvalue( 2) =-1.77245385090551610396403248159913346E+00
Difference in absolute value  2.22044604925031308084726333618164063E-16
```
whereas LAPACK precision (for doubles) is, taken from install.log:

```
  Precision                    =   2.220446049250313E-016
```
Why does anyone think LAPACK must do better than that, I do not understand. Indeed, some other hardwares do better on this example, but this is just pure luck, and/or ability to get better precision from the hardware--- something that is not available on G4 PPC --- or rather the compiler cannot take full advantage of the hardware.

I propose to adjust the precision in doctests, and be done with it. It is not a bug... 

I take the liberty to reduce the priority to major.

Well, do we agree now that this is a purely doctest problem? (mhansen (changeset 14950, trac #8054) 
has put too many digits there...)

One cannot expect more precision from NumPy/Lapack than a concrete combination of hardware and software gives you.
There is in fact a Lapack  call that will give you the precision, but this looks to me an overkill to code this into the doctest.
On all the platforms we have, the precision of more than 2.22045E-16 is what we get.
So the test should pass if the difference between the actual root and the NumPy output is less than that.
Which amounts to putting dots after, umh, you do the maths :-)

P.S. For the interested, this is how to test DGEEV without anything but a Fortran compiler (assuming Lapack is installed):

1) grab http://www.nag.co.uk/lapack-ex/examples/source/dgeev-ex.f off the net 

2) edit it to increase the number of digits printed, i.e. edit format statements labelled 9999 and 9998 so that they look as follows:

```
99999 FORMAT (1X,A,I2,A,1P,E42.35)
99998 FORMAT (1X,A,I2,A,'(',1P,E42.35,',',1P,E42.35,')')
```

3) compile it with your Fortran compiler:
(something like $ gfortran -llapack dgeev-ex.f )

4) create a text file, say, inp.txt, with the input (the data begins at the 2nd line):

```
# blah...
2
0. 0.3141592653589793115998000D+01
1. 0.
```

5) $ ./a.out <inp.txt

Eigenvalues of the 2x2 matrix in inp.txt, i.e. +/- square root of Pi, up to the precision the setup can manage, will be printed in all gory detail.

 Eigenvector( 2)

  4.9138E-01
```
On Dave machine I get:

```

 Eigenvalue( 2) = -1.77245385090551610396400000000000000E+00

 Eigenvector( 2)
 -8.7095E-01
  4.9138E-01
```
The second eigenvalue differs. Now we have to investigate inside the DGEEV call.
If it performs only additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and square
roots, there should be no difference according to IEEE 754 (unless different formats are used).

Worth noting is:

* lapack.a gets copied to $SAGE_LOCAL/lib in the lapack-20071123.p1.spkg
* On OS X, the ATLAS package is not built. 
* On Linux and Solaris, ATLAS get's built, creates a new lapack.a (I believe). 
* There's a comment dated 28th November 2007 in SPKG.txt for ATLAS that: *ATLAS produces borked lapack.so which has missing symbols*
* On Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD, there's some code in the ATLAS package for creating a shared liblapack.so from the static liblapack.a
* On Solaris, the liblapack.so get's deleted as it causes problems with R. 

So on OS X, one only needs to look at the LAPACK code, but on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris one needs to consider what ATLAS might do too. 

Also note that on my system, the output of my Noddy C program can't be changed by changing the compiler flags to use the 387 or SSE instructions. It always gives the output expected by the doctest.

What I find annoying about these doctests is that whilst the output will be 

`1.772453850905515`

or 

`1.772453850905516`

depending on system, 

With these changes, now anything from 

`1.772453850905510`

to

`1.772453850905519`

is considered acceptable. So we have permitted 'errors' several times higher than necessary. 

In some cases, I've met in the past, the adding of ... has resulted in results errors 1000x higher being considered acceptable. IMHO, this method of testing is not very good.

In the light of the "user warning" given, I think using dots is acceptable here.

---

W.r.t. 387 vs. SSE, try this:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

volatile double x=M_PI;
int main() {
    printf ("float:\n%+.70f\n%+.70f\n",sqrtf((float)x),-sqrtf((float)x));

    printf ("double:\n%+.70lf\n%+.70lf\n",sqrt(x),-sqrt(x));

    printf ("long double:\n%+.70Lf\n%+.70Lf\n",
        sqrtl((long double)x),
        -sqrtl((long double)x));

    return 0;
}
```
I only get a different result for the negated square root in the `float` case with 387 code (Core2, gcc 4.4.3).

Yes, I too get different results (OpenSolaris, Intel Xeon W3580 @ 3.33 GHz, gcc 4.5.0)

Perhaps Paul has some comments on those different numbers. They would appear to violate one of the principle claims of IEE-754 to me, but perhaps I am wrong.

the gcc documentation says that with {{{-mfpmath=387}}, temporary results are computed with 80
bits of precision (i.e., with double extended precision), thus different results might be
obtained. It also points to `-ffloat-store`, which prevents using extended precision.
With `-ffloat-store` I get on a 64-bit Core 2 (and without it, I get different absolute
values for float, exactly as Dave in the above comment):

this is related to this ticket. Does Lapack use single precision (i.e., the C float type)?

Lapack has routines for both single and double precision (names starting with S and D, respectively)

thus since the Lapack issue is with `dgeev`, it might be independent from the GCC float
issue. However, since the GCC issue is marked as a regression from 4.4, somebody with an older
version of GCC might try to recompile Lapack with it on the machines where one got different
absolute values.

The Sage / LAPACK results on the 32-bit Pentium4 Prescott came from GCC 4.3.3. (And I didn't get differences for my C test program there, regardless of SSE/387 and C99.)

Also, XCode comes with even older GCCs.

I tried this on MacOSX 10.5 PPC (G4) with gfortran 4.2.1, and saw no difference.
Basically, there seems to be no appropriate fortran compiler options available for this platform (Apple did not work on a Fortran compiler to use the better FP (altivec) on G4 processors; IBM did have a Fortran compiler, xlf (?) for that chip of them, but it is no longer sold).
The following must be telling the story:

```
(sage subshell) cantor:dgeev dima$ sage_fortran -faltivec -llapack -lblas $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgfortran.a dgt.f dgeev.f
f951: warning: command line option "-faltivec" is valid for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ but not for Fortran
f951: warning: command line option "-faltivec" is valid for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ but not for Fortran

the GCC developers say this is not a GCC bug, but
"simply the unpredictability of excess precision arithmetics",
and advise to use -ffloat-store/-fexcess-precision=standard/volatile float.

Is it possible to use `-ffloat-store` to build Lapack? It seems to be a valid option of
`sage_fortran`:

```
tarte% /localdisk/tmp/sage-4.6/local/bin/sage_fortran -v --help | grep store
...
-ffloat-store               Don't allocate floats and doubles in extended-
                              precision registers
```
