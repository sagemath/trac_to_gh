``` 
sage: M=matrix([[0,6],[0,0]]) 
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(return_diag=true)
[1, 1] 
```

This M is not symmetrizable, and the returned diagonal matrix doesn't symmetrize it.

* 

``` 
sage: M=matrix([2])
sage: M.is_symmetrizable() 
False
```

The code is checking that the diagonal entries are all zero even when testing for symmetrizability.

Hi Hugh,

Thanks for testing the code!

The problem here was that the algorithm checks conditions on columns (in ``_travel_column``), but didn't check if an entry `i,j` is zero, that than `j,i` is zero as well. So the bottom left zero was read, but no check was made on the top right non-zero...

I moved this piece of code, so it is only used for skew-symmetrizable matrices.

Hello Christian,

I guess the header is still bad. What did you do ? It seems that you modified the first line, and this is not good ! By hand ???

I think you need only to use "sage -hg qrefresh -e" and to give a commit message in the editor that should open. Compare for instance with the header of #11311. But I do not feel very competent on the build bot, alas.. Maybe one should ask the question on the mailing-list.

Hi Christian!

Below are all my comments.  The first one is something which should be fixed (but is trivial).  For the others, I don't know if any change needs to be made.  Suggestions occurred to me, but perhaps you had good reasons for doing things as you did, and in any case, it doesn't seem to me that these are likely to be routines that are time-critical.  I am perhaps over-thinking this process, because of its being the first time I am reviewing a patch.  

* The description of the return value for is_skew_symmetrizable, is_skew_symmetric, and _check_symmetrizability when return_diag is true says that it returns the diagonal matrix, when in fact, it returns the diagonal of the diagonal matrix.  (I like the output as is, I just think the documentation should change.)

* In _travel_column, technically, I think it makes more sense to check that i isn't in dict before getting self_ik and self_ki, and testing whether or not bool(self_ik) and bool(self_ki) agree -- if i is in dict, this has already been checked.  

* When return_diag is set, I don't see the point of saying [ d[i] for i in sorted( d.keys() ) ].  Why not just say [ d[i] for i in range( self._ncols ) ]?

Maybe just that the docstring should say that the input is a matrix in an integral domain?  Or is it even necessary to do anything at all?

* I don't really like the following, but, again, it's far from the intended use case (and it's not the fault of the code here):  

```
sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: M=matrix([[1,x],[-x,1]])
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(positive=true)
True
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(positive=true, return_diag=true)
[1, -1]
```

I am happy to give a positive review as soon as you fix at least the first point above (assuming the tests, which are running on my computer right now, pass).  Or should I wait until the patchbot is also happy?  Unless you think someone else should also review it, since I'm pretty inexperienced.

done.

>  * If the entries in the input matrix aren't in an integral domain, things will get ugly.  I realize that's far from the intended use case.  What's the protocol for something like that?  Maybe just that the docstring should say that the input is a matrix in an integral domain?  Or is it even necessary to do anything at all?


I added a sentence saying that the input matrix should be over an integral domain (we actually need to be able to invert all nonzero entries we see in the matrix - but the methods are not meant to be used like that and no one is going to do so I guess). Also I added that the base ring must be ordered if `positive=True`.

>  * I don't really like the following, but, again, it's far from the intended use case


There are many methods which do only make sense in certain contexts, I don't really know how to avoid that...

I hope it is now...

If someone wanna have a look that's fine, but you can also give it a positive review if no one is going to do so.

Thanks again! Christian
