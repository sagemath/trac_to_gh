``` 
sage: M=matrix([[0,6],[0,0]]) 
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(return_diag=true)
[1, 1] 
```

This M is not symmetrizable, and the returned diagonal matrix doesn't symmetrize it.

* 

``` 
sage: M=matrix([2])
sage: M.is_symmetrizable() 
False
```

The code is checking that the diagonal entries are all zero even when testing for symmetrizability.

* Zelevinsky spells his name with a final "y".

Hi Hugh,

Thanks for testing the code!

The problem here was that the algorithm checks conditions on columns (in ``_travel_column``), but didn't check if an entry `i,j` is zero, that than `j,i` is zero as well. So the bottom left zero was read, but no check was made on the top right non-zero...

I moved this piece of code, so it is only used for skew-symmetrizable matrices.

Hello Christian,

I guess the header is still bad. What did you do ? It seems that you modified the first line, and this is not good ! By hand ???

I think you need only to use "sage -hg qrefresh -e" and to give a commit message in the editor that should open. Compare for instance with the header of #11311. But I do not feel very competent on the build bot, alas.. Maybe one should ask the question on the mailing-list.

Hi Christian!

Below are all my comments.  The first one is something which should be fixed (but is trivial).  For the others, I don't know if any change needs to be made.  Suggestions occurred to me, but perhaps you had good reasons for doing things as you did, and in any case, it doesn't seem to me that these are likely to be routines that are time-critical.  I am perhaps over-thinking this process, because of its being the first time I am reviewing a patch.  

* The description of the return value for is_skew_symmetrizable, is_skew_symmetric, and _check_symmetrizability when return_diag is true says that it returns the diagonal matrix, when in fact, it returns the diagonal of the diagonal matrix.  (I like the output as is, I just think the documentation should change.)

* In _travel_column, technically, I think it makes more sense to check that i isn't in dict before getting self_ik and self_ki, and testing whether or not bool(self_ik) and bool(self_ki) agree -- if i is in dict, this has already been checked.  

* When return_diag is set, I don't see the point of saying [ d[i] for i in sorted( d.keys() ) ].  Why not just say [ d[i] for i in range( self._ncols ) ]?

* If the entries in the input matrix aren't in an integral domain, things will get ugly.  I realize that's far from the intended use case.  What's the protocol for something like that?  Maybe just that the docstring should say that the input is a matrix in an integral domain?  Or is it even necessary to do anything at all?

* I don't really like the following, but, again, it's far from the intended use case (and it's not the fault of the code here):  

```
sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: M=matrix([[1,x],[-x,1]])
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(positive=true)
True
sage: M.is_symmetrizable(positive=true, return_diag=true)
[1, -1]
```

I am happy to give a positive review as soon as you fix at least the first point above (assuming the tests, which are running on my computer right now, pass).  Or should I wait until the patchbot is also happy?  Unless you think someone else should also review it, since I'm pretty inexperienced.

There are many methods which do only make sense in certain contexts, I don't really know how to avoid that...

> Or should I wait until the patchbot is also happy?

I hope it is now...

> Unless you think someone else should also review it, since I'm pretty inexperienced.  

If someone wanna have a look that's fine, but you can also give it a positive review if no one is going to do so.

Thanks again! Christian

The docstrings for is_symmetrizable and is_skewsymmetrizable said that they took a boolean argument "skew" which is not true.  I have corrected this in my patch.

Hi Hugh,

do you mind if I fold your 3 lines into the first patch? Do you see other issues, or is the patch ready to go soon?

Thanks, Christian

Hi Christian--

I don't expect to find anything else, but on the other hand, I am still looking.  I will try to be fully done in a few days.  So it's up to you if you'd like to fold the patch in now.    

I did just notice something else, though.  In the examples for "is_skew_symmetrizable", one of them actually calls is_symmetrizable, not is_skew_symmetrizable".  This seems harmless but odd.  

cheers,

Hugh

Hi Christian--

I made a couple of very minor changes to documentation.  

This is a positive review provided the patchbot is okay with it.  

I have confused matters by uploading a second patch.  I meant it to replace my other patch.  I don't see how to remove attached patches, or I would fix this.  (Nor could I easily find an explanation in the documentation.)  How do you do it?

cheers,

Hugh
