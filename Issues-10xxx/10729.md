Local modules located in $HOME/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages appear in sys.path `_before_` IPython/Extensions and thus, a local version of IPython (lacking CrahsHandler module) replaces sage's own version.

I just found a workaround to this issue. It doesn't actually solve the bug, but it might be usefull to someone experiencing this:

Citing [1]_: "In addition to the global site-packages paths, site is responsible for adding the user-specific locations to the import path. The user-specific paths are all based on the USER_BASE directory, which usually located in a part of the filesystem owned (and writable) by the current user. Inside the USER_BASE is a site-packages directory, with the path accessible as USER_SITE. The USER_SITE path name is created using the same platform-specific values..."
"The user base directory can be set through the PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable, and has platform-specific defaults (~/Python$version/site-packages for Windows and ~/.local for non-Windows)."

Setting PYTHONUSERBASE to a "dummy" location, i.e. an empty directory, prevents python from loading the modules from, say, ~/.local/... which conflict with sage's own.

The user base directory can be set through the PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable, and has platform-specific defaults (~/Python$version/site-packages for Windows and ~/.local for non-Windows).
