It seems that `sage -f sagenb-VERSION` doesn't actually do anything. It does **not** change the `devel/sagenb-main` directory. This issue also breaks upgrading sage-4.6 to sage-4.6.1.alpha3 for me, because sagenb is not actually upgraded.

<a id='comment:7'></a>* `command -v sage` is a bit faster than `sage -v`, but I don't mind.
   (The latter isn't much more specific since other programs called `sage` are likely to also understand that option, with arbitrary results...)

  * Solaris' `grep` *does* understand `-q`, but unfortunately not the one in the "default" path. We should IMHO check in Sage's `configure` (and/or `sage-env`) that we have the proper / capable (POSIX-conformant) tools in the path, not limited to `grep`.

  * If `sage -pkg ...` fails, the error message should start with "`Error: `" and go to `sys.stderr`; I would also *quote* the failed command there.

  * W.r.t.

```python
# This spkg-dist doesn't need any Sage components, it is fine to run 
# it from a system-wide Python. -- Jeroen Demeyer
```
  I wouldn't rely on a (potentially) system-wide `python`, since that might actually lack some components, or have versions which are too old (which definitely *can* cause import errors).

 It's not that clear what you mean by "Sage components"; `spkg-dist` certainly requires Sage's Mercurial, some scripts and the programs these use. It also requires (at least) `setuptools`, which are shipped with Sage, but may not be installed in a system-wide Python.
 
 (We could `try: import ... except ImportError: ...`  to give a more "friendly" error message in the latter case. I don't know if some / what minimal versions of Python and the imported modules are required. Experienced Sage developers are likely to have current versions installed, but I think SageNB is meanwhile subject to changes by a wider group as well.)

 So it would be safer to use Sage's Python; if we keep `sage-python` in `SAGE_ROOT`, which should be in the path, or at least `sage-python` itself, we could use

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sage-python
```
 in the `spkg-dist` script.


I think I'm ok with the rest of the reviewer patch; I still have to provide a version of my patch(es) with the currently "lost" commit messages...

Of course intentionally. ;-)

Besides that a missing `#!` can have strange "side" effects, too, I replaced the `cp` by `mv`, which makes the deletion of `sagenb-main` obsolete (and is of course much faster).
