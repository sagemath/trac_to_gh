A new version of PolyBoRi is available.

**Changelog**

* Polynomials, monomials, variables, and `BooleSets` now own a reference to a fully-functionally `BoolePolyRing` (including ordering)
* Orderings can work independently from ring
* Simplified interface: remove `*Assign()` variants from diagrams
* Added `polybori.nf.simple_nf`
* Simplification of declare_ring in ipbori
* Rename `BoolePolynomials::reducibleBy` ->  `BoolePolynomials::firstReducibleBy`
* Unittests for libpolybori are available, covering 98% of libpolybori
* Added experimental PolyGUI

## Summary
* SPKG: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.0.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/polybori-0.7.0.p1.spkg)
* Apply: [attachment:polybori-0.7.0.p1.patch]

<a id='comment:1'></a>I've cut a first SPKG:

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/polybori-0.7.0.spkg

It compiles on my 64-bit Debian/GNU Linux, but the Sage interface doesn't play ball yet:

```
sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.cpp:3182: error: ‘CDDInterface’ is not a template
sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.cpp:3182: error: ‘dd_base’ is not a member of ‘polybori::CTypes’

sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.cpp:3187: error: ‘dd_base’ is not a member of ‘polybori::CTypes’
```

It seems the type of CDDInterface changed. Alexander, can you comment?

Not really, PolyBoRi is only imported into crypto/boolean_function.pyx.

Can I help? Is there a rc for Sage 4.7 somewhere?

<a id='comment:26'></a>Hi,

it seems I found a regression in the PolyBoRi 0.7.0 update:

```python
sage: B.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: F = Ideal(B.random_element() for _ in range(B.ngens()))
sage: F
Ideal (a*b + a + b*e + c*e + 1, a + b + c*d + c + 1, a*c + c + d*f + d + 1, a*c + c*f + c + d*f + 1, c*f + c + d + e + 1, a + b*c + b*d + e*f + 1) of Boolean PolynomialRing in a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: F.groebner_basis()

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

<a id='comment:38'></a>The last patch applies cleanly to 4.6.2 and passes tests in the `sage/{rings,crypto,libs}` directories. The package and the patch look good to me. I'm switching this to a positive review.

Thanks for all the work guys.
