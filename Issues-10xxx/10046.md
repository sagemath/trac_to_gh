The following 3D simplex shouldn't be all that challenging, but we don't handle it well:

```
test = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0.8333333333, 0.8333333333, 0.8333333333], [1.022799569, 0.6321252838, 0.0], [0.7354697967, 0.280924808, 0.4545456098], [1.348361678, 0.0, 0.5150289612]], field=RDF)

test.facial_incidences()
[[0, [0, 1, 3]], [1, [1, 2, 3]], [2, []], [3, [0, 1, 2]]]
```

The root of this seems to be in how the incidence_matrix is based on the is_zero method:

```
H = list(test.Hrep_generator())[2]
print H
for V in test.Vrep_generator():
    if test._is_zero(H*V):
        test._incidence_matrix[V.index(),H.index()] = 1
    else:
        print H*V, ' for vertex ', V.vector()

An inequality (848702.5784, 1373226.161, -2221927.54) x + -1.0 >= 0
-0.000499999849126  for vertex  (0.8333333333, 0.8333333333, 0.8333333333)
1736102.60814  for vertex  (1.022799569, 0.6321252838, 0.0)
-0.000186597928405  for vertex  (0.7354697967, 0.280924808, 0.4545456098)
-5.35207800567e-05  for vertex  (1.348361678, 0.0, 0.5150289612)
```

and in the _init_field method of Polyhedron:

```
# 1e-6 is the cddf+ default fuzzy zero cutoff
            self._is_zero = lambda x: abs(x)<=1e-6
```

I realize that there will always be some problems like this for numerical (i.e. inexact) polyhedra, but it seems pretty sad that we can't handle a nice, reasonably sized simplex in 3D.  The only thing that immediately occurs to me is to either change how the inequalities are scaled or do something more complicated than the current _is_zero.

This is not a reasonable simplex, it is one with razor-sharp teeth ready to gnaw your leg off:

```
sage: v = test.Vrepresentation()
sage: matrix([vector(v[0]), vector(v[2]), vector(v[3])]).det()
-1.64748394458e-07
```
That said, it would be nice if cdd could work with doubles instead of float for ~16 accurate digits. PPL can do that easily using templates and c++.

Well, that seems far too pessimistic to me.  This isn't very far from a regular simplex.  Its unacceptable to me that we can't handle this, even with cddlib.  It means that a variety of graphical output totally fails.

That said, I'm all in favor of switching to something better for our default convex hull method.

This needs to be addressed within cddlib, we can't just renormalize the cddlib output. I think it would be a waste of time to try to fix up cddlib, though.

I'm thinking of changing the Inequality and Equation initializations to have:

```
if polyhedron._cdd_type == 'real':
    normal_norm = vector(data[1:]).norm()
    data = [x/normal_norm for x in data]

This solves the problem I had above, and all tests pass.  Some of those tests include numerical polytopes.  I also tested it on a few additional high dimensional cases.

I won't make a patch yet since I suspect I will hear some counter-arguments...

If you insist, can you put the normalization somewhere in the cdd IO routines so that there are no crufty hacks in the main `Polyhedron` logic.

Which binary are you using to test PPL? The ppl_lcdd emulation supports only rational cdd input files.

I disagree, and I would like to fix this problem.  For rigorous computation I don't trust numerical computation of convex hulls anyway, unless there is some additional way to certify the correctness.  The numerical routines are important for having fast graphical output.  

The current behavior is just terrible, and I think this is a real improvement for lots of actual use cases.

To keep the main Polyhedron logic clean I will put in _init_from_cdd_output as follows:

```
        skip_to('H-representation')
        self._Hrepresentation = Sequence([])
        equations = cdd_linearities()
        skip_to('begin')
        l = cddout.pop(0).split()
        assert self._ambient_dim == int(l[1])-1, "Different ambient dimension?"
        for i in range(int(l[0])):
            l = cddout.pop(0)
            data = cdd_convert(l)
            if self._cdd_type == 'real':
                normal_norm = vector(data[1:]).norm()
                data = [x/normal_norm for x in data]
            if i in equations:
                Equation(self, data);
            else:
                Inequality(self, data);
```
