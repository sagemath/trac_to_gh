## NOTE ABOUT spkg-check
I tried adding an spkg-check, but the fact is that the ZODB test suite fails miserably all over the place.  This is true both of the version in Sage (3.7.0) and the version posted here.  The failures start with:

```
(sage subshell) deep:src wstein$ python test.py
Running tests from build/lib.macosx-10.6-i386-2.6
test.py:44: DeprecationWarning: zope.testing.testrunner is deprecated in favour of zope.testrunner.
```
but there is no `zope.testrunner` so the DeprecationWarning is wrong!!  And it gets worse from there.  Tons of key errors, other failures, then a total hang.

Regarding spkg-check, here's what it *should* look like:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd src/
python test.py
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

ZODB is used by the database_cremona optional spkg. Â Thus a way to test this package is to install that optional package, then do:

```
sage: EllipticCurve("30001a1")
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 171*x - 6408 over Rational Field
sage: CremonaDatabase().largest_conductor()
130000
```
and not get an error.  Just that is enough to show that the ZODB is doing pretty much all we use it for in Sage.   Running the test suite for ZODB is unfortunately not possible :-(. 

Also, be sure to test the "devel/sage/sage/databases" directory, and you of course should do "make test" in SAGE_ROOT to test the whole library.

Why should an independent module only be shipped as part of another independent module?

Even if zope.interface was currently only used by sagenb, I'd still think zope.interface should be an separate spkg.

> * We fix up the conway polynomials (#12205)

That sounds good to me.

Is sagenb a system that should be able to run independent of another system, or is sagenb supposed to be installed on top of another system (such as Sage)? In the former case, I could understand why sagenb comes with batteries included. But if sagenb is intended to be a small brick in a large wall, then it seems to me that a small brick shouldn't attempt to contain other small bricks...

But I am not a software engineer. Anyway, the fact that sagenb contains a lot of dependencies (taking the risk that the same dependency is provided twice, perhaps even in different versions) should not force us to add yet another module to sagenb.

Can somebody actually post a log from a failed install attempt? It works for me. The version mismatches shouldn't matter either, distutils is checking that each package's dependencies are satisfied. You don't need matching versions of all zope* packages (indeed, they are not in sync).

Also I don't understand what Jeroen posted, the spkg from the ticket issue contains zope.exceptions-4.0.4.zip and zope.interface-4.0.2.tar.gz and not the versions you mention.

The problem is this:

```

```

When transaction is installing, zope.interface hasn't been installed yet and must be downloaded from the internet.
