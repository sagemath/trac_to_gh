<a id='comment:1'></a>## NOTE ABOUT spkg-check
I tried adding an spkg-check, but the fact is that the ZODB test suite fails miserably all over the place.  This is true both of the version in Sage (3.7.0) and the version posted here.  The failures start with:

```
(sage subshell) deep:src wstein$ python test.py
Running tests from build/lib.macosx-10.6-i386-2.6
test.py:44: DeprecationWarning: zope.testing.testrunner is deprecated in favour of zope.testrunner.
```
but there is no `zope.testrunner` so the DeprecationWarning is wrong!!  And it gets worse from there.  Tons of key errors, other failures, then a total hang.

Regarding spkg-check, here's what it *should* look like:

```/usr/bin/env bash
cd src/
python test.py
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>ZODB is used by the database_cremona optional spkg. Â Thus a way to test this package is to install that optional package, then do:

```
sage: EllipticCurve("30001a1")
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 171*x - 6408 over Rational Field
sage: CremonaDatabase().largest_conductor()
130000
```
and not get an error.  Just that is enough to show that the ZODB is doing pretty much all we use it for in Sage.   Running the test suite for ZODB is unfortunately not possible :-(. 

Also, be sure to test the "devel/sage/sage/databases" directory, and you of course should do "make test" in SAGE_ROOT to test the whole library.

Why should an independent module only be shipped as part of another independent module?

Even if zope.interface was currently only used by sagenb, I'd still think zope.interface should be an separate spkg.

That sounds good to me.

Yes, it is supposed to be something that can run without Sage (it is supposed to only require python).   I don't know to what extent that is currently the case.

When transaction is installing, zope.interface hasn't been installed yet and must be downloaded from the internet.
