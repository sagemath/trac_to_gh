## NOTE ABOUT spkg-check
I tried adding an spkg-check, but the fact is that the ZODB test suite fails miserably all over the place.  This is true both of the version in Sage (3.7.0) and the version posted here.  The failures start with:

```
(sage subshell) deep:src wstein$ python test.py
Running tests from build/lib.macosx-10.6-i386-2.6
test.py:44: DeprecationWarning: zope.testing.testrunner is deprecated in favour of zope.testrunner.
```
but there is no `zope.testrunner` so the DeprecationWarning is wrong!!  And it gets worse from there.  Tons of key errors, other failures, then a total hang.

Regarding spkg-check, here's what it *should* look like:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd src/
python test.py
```

ZODB is used by the database_cremona optional spkg. Â Thus a way to test this package is to install that optional package, then do:

```
sage: EllipticCurve("30001a1")
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 171*x - 6408 over Rational Field
sage: CremonaDatabase().largest_conductor()
130000
```
and not get an error.  Just that is enough to show that the ZODB is doing pretty much all we use it for in Sage.   Running the test suite for ZODB is unfortunately not possible :-(. 

Also, be sure to test the "devel/sage/sage/databases" directory, and you of course should do "make test" in SAGE_ROOT to test the whole library.

I just tried installing this and at the end got:

```

Finished processing dependencies for ZODB3==3.7.0

real	0m20.027s
user	0m14.322s
sys	0m2.886s
Successfully installed zodb3-3.10.1
```
so somehow setuptools is still thinking partly that it needs to install ZODB 3.7.0.  So screw it.  I'm changing this to needs work and not messing with it anymore.

For review purposes, I've just taken William's original upgrade to 3.10.1 and dumped 3.10.5 in instead. 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/zodb3-3.10.1.spkg

As it turns out, our present ZODB3 version does not support Python 2.7, so upgrading is very much recommended.

I cannot install the last version of the spkg (the previous one seemed fine).
It fails during the installation of the dependencies:
* it install transaction 1.1.1,
* and then fails with zope.interface.

Why should an independent module only be shipped as part of another independent module?

Even if zope.interface was currently only used by sagenb, I'd still think zope.interface should be an separate spkg.

> * We fix up the conway polynomials (#12205)

That sounds good to me.

Is sagenb a system that should be able to run independent of another system, or is sagenb supposed to be installed on top of another system (such as Sage)? In the former case, I could understand why sagenb comes with batteries included. But if sagenb is intended to be a small brick in a large wall, then it seems to me that a small brick shouldn't attempt to contain other small bricks...

But I am not a software engineer. Anyway, the fact that sagenb contains a lot of dependencies (taking the risk that the same dependency is provided twice, perhaps even in different versions) should not force us to add yet another module to sagenb.

Yes, it is supposed to be something that can run without Sage (it is supposed to only require python).   I don't know to what extent that is currently the case.
