Yup, I see what you are talking about - e.g. 

if (x.is_equal(_ex1))  // log(1) -> 0
     return _ex0;

Although it might be nice to stay relatively close to Ginac and fix such things on the Sage level if that's not really bad.
```
This ticket's goal is to implement one of these solutions (that is, catch this in function.pyx or in Pynac).

We might as well also deal with `sin(0), tan(0), sin(pi)` from #10972 here as well, otherwise that really wasn't a duplicate.

#10972 was closed as a duplicate. Ironic that I reported both, though in my defense, that ticket does list a few specific functions beyond log for which that happens, and it was 8 months ago :)
