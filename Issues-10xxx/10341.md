Sage 4.6.1 will contain a new set of backend classes for mixed integer programming, which will make it easier to write interfaces for other solvers. There has been some off-list discussion about this interface and the follow changes were agreed upon:

* :func: `add_linear_constraint` should allow ``lb`` and ``ub``  instead of direction and one bound, it's more expressive.
* :func:`add_variable` should return the index of the newly created variable instead of the next index.
* change :func:`add_linear_constraint` to accept any iterable of the form`` [(c,v) ...]``
* ``min`` and ``max`` should be lower bound (or ``lb``) and upper bound (or ``ub``) to conform to MIP conventions
* allow parameters in :func:`add_variable`

The patches are to be applied in this order:

* mip_interface_changes.patch
* trac_10431-part2.patch
* trac_10431-part3.patch
* trac_10431-part4.patch
* trac_10431-part5.patch

P.S. : Oh, yes.. Let's add this optional argument if there is no way around. If at some point we find a trick, it won't be as hard to remove an optional argument from an interface as any other, as most of the method calls don't include it.

So in the end

Okay, what remains to be done then:

* drop setting a constraint name by row_name()
* add an optional parameter name to add_variable and add_linear_constraint
* (optional) make row() return a list [(c1,v1),...,(cn,vn)]
* (optional) add an optional parameter obj to add_variable
* (optional) unify get/set_objective_value

Anything I missed?

Well, if your doctests pass then I guess the docstring is not enough.

I do not think it is that awful, and removing all this name-related stuff from the class will just make it easier to work with.

I mean, it would have been nice to be able to deal with names, but :

* The solvers all have a different way to deal with them. If we want to be able to deal with them all, we'll just end up with an awkward interface
* You don't use them, I don't use them, they play no part in the actual solving of LP which stil;l has to be considered the main point here

It looks like a lot of work for something we're not even sure we can use...

It just exposes I had a stupid idea when I wrote this set_row_name in the first place. And I guess it's only fitting that I clean my own mess.

Oh ! To compare performances, you could just try a sage -t on graph.py digraph.py and generic_graph.py.

I guess the performances would then depend on the kind of problem : all the solvers I tried until now are just awful for the minor method :

```python
sage: %time graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5).minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(4), solver = "GLPK")
CPU times: user 10.59 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 10.60 s
Wall time: 10.62 s
{0: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)], 1: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (2, 0)], 2: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)], 3: [(1, 1)]}
```
The methods raises an exception when 4 becomes 5, which is natural as the problem has no solution, but it takes one lifetime to get this answer from GLPK. If SCIP can get it quickly, that's just a miracle `:-D`

Another problem of the same kind :

```python
n = 7
graphs.Grid2dGraph(n,n).disjoint_routed_paths([((0,0), (n-1,n-1)), ((0, n-1), (n-1, 0))])
```

This already takes 10 seconds with CPLEX. Try n=8 if you are patient !

The answer is also an infeasibility, and the solvers are having a hard time proving it.. But I guess it just comes from my bad LP formulation `^^;`

A different type of LP formulation, on random graphs :

```python
from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import edge_coloring
%timeit edge_coloring(graphs.RandomGNP(30,.3), solver = "GLPK", verbose = 2)
5 loops, best of 3: 4.47 s per loop
```

On my machine:

```python
sage: %time graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5).minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(4), solver = "GLPK", verbose=0)
CPU times: user 2.81 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.81 s
Wall time: 2.82 s
{0: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)], 1: [(3, 0), (1, 0), (3, 1), (2, 0)], 2: [(2, 1)], 3: [(4, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 4)]}
```

It seems there's still a bug in my SCIP interface:

```python
sage: %time graphs.Grid2dGraph(5,5).minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(4), solver = "SCIP", verbose=0)
CPU times: user 1.88 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 1.92 s

For some reason MIPVariable ignores the optional name parameter and hardcodes "x". Is there a reason for this?

Oh, and I of course checked all the patches on CPLEX and Coin each time. All tests do not pass, because of old bugs :

* Coin does not support names, so some doctests in mip.py fail because of that
* for some reason the variable_min/max command on CPLEX variables that are not bounded return a BIG NUMBER and not None when the variable is not bounded (the doctest of a p.show() in mip.py fails because of that)
* There is a doctest in generic_graph that fails when one uses LP and Coin to solve a max_flow problem on graphs whose edges are randomly weighted. Coin sometimes answers 8.16540000001 instead of 8.1654 and the tests is an equality.

In the end, the remaining bugs (and they have been there for quite a while, but I did not really worry....) are all about displaying stuff. One is about numerical noise on a very specific case (Coin + Flows.
