lcalc fails to build with the gcc-4.6 version in Fedora 15 alpha:

#define Int(x) (int)(lcalc_to_double(x))

```

> `[Volker Braun wrote]` The reason is the following code horror from src/src/include/Lcommon.h

The poor quality of the lcalc source code appears to have put off one Sage user when she looked at it. To quote her:

"''Unfortunately, lcalc was the part of Sage I intended using - now I think I
will look at other software.''"

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/fab46afe7a8ac1c2/e43f31d452dfbfbe?lnk=gst&q=Warning+messages+when+compiling+%27lcalc%27#e43f31d452dfbfbe

I'm also very unimpressed. Even with your changes lcalc generates over 200 compiler warnings from gcc 4.6.0 

Sun Studio would never compile lcalc (see #7065) - I doubt it will do even with your changes. 

Lcalc used to refuse to compile on Solaris with g++ as the Makefile has a compiler option to suppress warnings from the assembler, which works with the GNU assembler, but which the Sun assembler does not understand. (The "`-W`" option was sent directly to the assembler with the g++ option "`-Wa W`".)

Lcalc will not install on HP-UX (#7178). I've never tried on AIX, but I would not be surprised if it failed on that too.  

Your code builds OK with gcc 4.6.0 on OpenSolaris and passes all the doctests. So I'm assuming you want it reviewed, in which case I'll give it a positive review. 

It would really help if you attached a Mercurial patch showing the changes you have made. It makes review easier, and is useful when people look back at tickets. I've attached a patch which shows your changes. 

I've changed the *Reported Upstream* pull-down on trac from *N/A* to *Not yet reported upstream. Will do shortly* as clearly this is an upstream bug. I'll report it to 
Micheal Rubinstein.

It had not before you reminded me, but I have now done it. I reported it to Michael Rubinstein (mrubinst <<<ATT> uwaterloo.ca) today @ 1307 GMT. I've changed the "reported upstream" pull-down to reflect this.

I got this from Mike a couple of hours ago, after I suggested he make his latest code available in it's current state, which is clearly not due for release yet.
