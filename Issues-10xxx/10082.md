On the Skynet hosts flavius (x86_64-Linux-k8-f12), iras (ia64-Linux-suse), installing the Python package sometimes fails with

```
[...]
Sleeping for three seconds before testing python
'import site' failed; use -v for traceback
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named math
math module failed to import
```
This is with 4.6.alpha2.  Running `./sage -python` and doing `import math` works.

From near the end of `spkg-install`:

```sh
[...]
# Sleeping for three seconds so that parallel 'make install' catches up
# with the following test.
echo "Sleeping for three seconds before testing python"
sleep 3

# Make sure extension modules were built correctly.
python -c "import math"

if [ $? -eq 0 -a -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" ]; then
    echo "math module OK"
else
    echo "math module failed to import"
    exit 1
fi
[...]
```

Yes, I have seen this problem once on IBM's AIX operating system. This ticket prompted me to open #10083 where the failure of Python to build the `math` module on AIX 5.3 is shown. 

Clearly it has happened before on other systems too, which prompted someone to add the check that the `math` module had installed. However, I can't see who did this, or on what ticket, as SPKG.txt does not show it and neither did a quick glance at the output from `hg log`

I've now also seen the problem in the description on menas.  For me, it seems the `math` module is installed, since I can run `./sage -python` and `import` it, at least, without problems.

Is this a parallel build problem?  Reinstalling the package serially works.

Could we do better than sleep for an arbitrary three seconds?

I believed I've solved the problems above on flavius, iras, and menas by not setting the unnecessary `PYTHONHOME` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables.  It was on each of these machines that I compiled the buildbot user's own Python distribution, in order to work around missing Python development packages and/or missing zlib support, both of which are required for `buildbot-slave`.  It appears sufficient just to add the directory containing `python` to the `PATH`.

With this fix, the main remaining problems with compiling 4.6.alpha3 on Skynet are #9897 and the file locking problems (building GD, MPFI, and accessing the SQLite database `graphs.db`) on most of the Fedora 13 machines.

I'm closing this ticket, but feel free to reopen it, if you have the same problem.  See #10083 for a similar problem on AIX.
