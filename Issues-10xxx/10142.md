# Issue 10142: Frequent crash in ode_solver

    "body": "I have been using Sagemath (several versions, but must recently, 4.5.2; but this bug existed in previous versions as well) for my Honours thesis in quantum mechanics, and have been making heavy use of the integration routines. The ode_solver regularly crashes for specific step-sizes. I have not been able to work out a systematic pattern, but if it doesn't work once, it continues not to work no matter how many times you try. It can crash for any step size; sometimes even for integers. It does, however, usually only crash on the final step. It also seems to be independent of the numerical solver.\n\nWhen it crashes, it reports something like:\n\nERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input\nThe following traceback may be corrupted or invalid\nThe error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (60, 0))\n\n---\nValueError\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Traceback (most recent call last)\n\n/home/themadhatter/Honours/modelling/<ipython console> in <module>()\n\n/home/themadhatter/Honours/modelling/lib/sequences.pyc in evolution(self, period, step, perturbations, carryon)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 def evolution(self,period=100,step=1,perturbations=None,carryon=False):\n---> 18 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return self.SYSTEM.integrate_numerically(perturbation=perturbations,self_entangle=True,step=step,period=period,projector=self.PROJECTOR,time_dependence=self.TIME_DEPENDENCE,carryon=carryon)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 19 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 def fidelity(self,period=100,step=1,perturbations=None,carryon=False):\n\n/home/themadhatter/Honours/modelling/lib/hamiltonian.pyc in integrate_numerically(self, y_0, period, step, perturbations, error_rel, error_abs, self_entangle, projector, time_dependence, function, increase_dim, noise, carryon, **params)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 560 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 else:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 561 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 integrator = self.Integrator(self,y_0,self_entangle=self_entangle,noise=noise,increase_dim=increase_dim,perturbations=perturbations,time_dependence=time_dependence,cache='numerical',error_rel=error_rel,error_abs=error_abs)\n--> 562 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return integrator.start(period,step)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 563 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 #\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 564 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 # Integrate a given initial state using the Hamiltonian and compare to ideal evolution\n\n/home/themadhatter/Honours/modelling/lib/hamiltonian.pyc in start(self, period, step)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 521 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 522 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 def start(self,period=100,step=1):\n--> 523 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 self.results = self.integrate(self.y_0,period=period,step=step)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 524 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if self.multiple:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 525 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return self.results\n\n/home/themadhatter/Honours/modelling/lib/hamiltonian.pyc in integrate(self, y_0, period, step, t_offset)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 512 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 513 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for y_0 in y_0s:\n--> 514 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T.ode_solve(y_0=y_0,t_span=[0,period],params=params,num_points=int(period/step))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 515 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 results.append(T.solution)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 516 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pb_run+=1\n\n/home/themadhatter/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/gsl/ode.so in sage.gsl.ode.ode_solver.ode_solve (sage/gsl/!ode.c:4558)() \n\nValueError: error solving\n\nI have been very careful in checking my code, and am confident that it is not a fault in my code.

I have been very careful in checking my code, and am confident that it is not a fault in my code. I have been working around it by changing the step-size adhoc... but when doing a series of runs; it is VERY annoying. ><

Please fix this!

Hi, 
This definitely needs more instructions on how to trigger the crash.  Thanks!

Whoops!

I sat down today to do a thorough analysis of my code, and found that the error was actually in some progress bar code that I have been using, which throws an assertion error if progress is > 100; which it was by a smidgeon due to the approximations of float numbers.

My humble apologies for wasting your time... and my faith is bolstered in Sage :).

Thank you!
