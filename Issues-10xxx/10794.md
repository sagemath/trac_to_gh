Hi Rob

Looks good. All doctests pass, all tests I cooked up passed, and the code looks good. I couldn't even find a typo.

Out of interest, over what fields other than QQbar will this method be called?

Thanks, again, Simon.  Isn't QQbar enough?  ;-)  Once somebody implements Fpbar (algebraic closure of finite fields of characteristic p) then we will have another.
