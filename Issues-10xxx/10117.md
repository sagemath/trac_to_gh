Running:

```
sage: macaulay2_console()
sh: line 1: M2: not found
```

gives that above error message, but the help page does not document this is an optional program, and not part of Sage. 

```
sage: help(macaulay2_console)

macaulay2_console()
    Spawn a new M2 command-line session.
    
    EXAMPLES:
        sage: macaulay2_console()                    # not tested
        Macaulay 2, version 1.1
        with packages: Classic, Core, Elimination, IntegralClosure, LLLBases, Parsing, PrimaryDecomposition, SchurRings, TangentCone
        ...
```

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
This is true of all external software consoles -- try any of them:

```
sage: _ = any(print(x) for x in dir() if 'console' in x)
axiom_console
fricas_console
gap3_console
gap_console
giac_console
gnuplot_console
gp_console
kash_console
lie_console
lisp_console
macaulay2_console
magma_console
maple_console
mathematica_console
matlab_console
maxima_console
mupad_console
mwrank_console
octave_console
qepcad_console
r_console
sage0_console
singular_console
```

When Pexpect calls fail, useful tips are displayed
via the interface's `_install_hints` method.

We should also display this installation information
when console calls fail.
