<a id='comment:12'></a>Trac10973.4.patch addresses everything in report.txt.

This returns the same result as the original integral_points over `Q` with all curves of conductor up to 1000 (and also agrees with Magma).  This also finds the missing points referred to in ticket #10152.

We compared times on all curves over `Q` of conductor less then 1000; the original implementation was usually 2 to 8 
times faster, though in certain instances it did not find all integral points (this was ticket #10152).  So this is a bit of a slowdown.  

If `E` is a curve over `Q`, then E.integral_points() calls the method in ell_rational_points.py (the previous, faster, not always correct, method).

Update.  Using Sage-4.7.2 and Magma V2.17-9, these all agree:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1264i1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 0 : 1), (4 : 10 : 1), (18 : 80 : 1), (246404 : 122312970 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 0 : 1), (4 : -10 : 1), (18 : 80 : 1), (246404 : 122312970 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1328b1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 2 : 1), (4386 : 290438 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 2 : 1), (4386 : 290438 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1656f1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(3 : 0 : 1), (6 : 18 : 1), (27 : 144 : 1), (336678 : 195353910 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (3 : 0 : 1), (6 : -18 : 1), (27 : 144 : 1), (336678 : -195353910 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1848i1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 3 : 1), (3206 : 181557 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 3 : 1), (3206 : 181557 : 1) ]
```
That is using vanilla Sage (i.e. without any patches from this ticket).
I am about to do a more systematic test.

The first curve where Sage-4.7.2 fails to find the same number of integral points as Magma V2.17-9 is 2082a1 where Sage-4.7.2 finds x-coordinates -11,-2,4,13 but not 507525709 (!).  But the new version does find that last one.

I will carry on testing, but there is no need to delay merging this (expect perhaps if I find a curve for which the new code fails to find all known points).

For all curves of conductor up to 10000, there are precisely 3 where Sage-4.7.2 misses integral points compared with Magma V2.17-9, namely 2082a1, 6104b1, 8470g1, 8470g2;  in each case just one point is missed.

Regarding timings, up to 10000 Sage-4.7.2 took 157m while Magma took 943m;  that may be an unfair comparison though since Sage took generators from the DB while Magma (I think) computed them from scratch.  I will redo this with the current patch applied.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:45'></a>I have done some debugging, not yet complete but I'll be away for a while and wanted to record what I found so far.\n\n2082a1:   the old code is not nearly careful enough about computing elliptic logs and periods to high enough precision, and I have worked a bit on improving that, but in this example it reduces the coefficient bound first from `10^44` to 34 (that looks OK to me) and then to 12, which is not OK since the actual bound is 13.  And I can see what is done wrong:  in Cohen's notation you need a lower bound on `d(L,0)^2` which is greater than `T^2+Q`, and in this second step it is not;  the code makes an adjustment, which is not (as far as I can see) justified.  Instead one should increase the scaling parameter C.  I found that multiplying C by 100 is OK, but yields a worse bound on the coefficients, namely 56.  If one did check all 34 multiples of the generator (the rank is 1) then that would be OK.

<a id='comment:45'></a>I have done some debugging, not yet complete but I'll be away for a while and wanted to record what I found so far.

2082a1:   the old code is not nearly careful enough about computing elliptic logs and periods to high enough precision, and I have worked a bit on improving that, but in this example it reduces the coefficient bound first from `10^44` to 34 (that looks OK to me) and then to 12, which is not OK since the actual bound is 13.  And I can see what is done wrong:  in Cohen's notation you need a lower bound on `d(L,0)^2` which is greater than `T^2+Q`, and in this second step it is not;  the code makes an adjustment, which is not (as far as I can see) justified.  Instead one should increase the scaling parameter C.  I found that multiplying C by 100 is OK, but yields a worse bound on the coefficients, namely 56.  If one did check all 34 multiples of the generator (the rank is 1) then that would be OK.  But the new code here manages to get successive bounds `10^40`, 53, 18 and uses 18 which works better than 34 would have done!  The two implementations need further careful comparison.

The complete list of missed points with Sage 8.5 is: 12 points on 11 curves:

 1701d1, 1848f1, 2082a1, 3510n1, 6514b1,
 177211a1,
 23808e1,
 268740c1,
 285928a1,
 66432f1,
 92554e1,

missing 1 point in each case except 2 points on 1848f1.

#27015 will deal with this.
