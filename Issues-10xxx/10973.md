All examples from the paper referenced now pass as do all examples from #10152, so once this is implemented, this also fixes #10152.

Trac10973.4.patch addresses everything in report.txt.

This returns the same result as the original integral_points over `Q` with all curves of conductor up to 1000 (and also agrees with Magma).  This also finds the missing points referred to in ticket #10152.

We compared times on all curves over `Q` of conductor less then 1000; the original implementation was usually 2 to 8 
times faster, though in certain instances it did not find all integral points (this was ticket #10152).  So this is a bit of a slowdown.  

If `E` is a curve over `Q`, then E.integral_points() calls the method in ell_rational_points.py (the previous, faster, not always correct, method).

Why?  Surely it would definitely be better to return a correct answer by default.   I can imagine leaving the old code in with an not-by-default option to call it and docs that mention it is faster.

Update.  Using Sage-4.7.2 and Magma V2.17-9, these all agree:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1264i1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 0 : 1), (4 : 10 : 1), (18 : 80 : 1), (246404 : 122312970 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 0 : 1), (4 : -10 : 1), (18 : 80 : 1), (246404 : 122312970 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1328b1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 2 : 1), (4386 : 290438 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 2 : 1), (4386 : 290438 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1656f1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(3 : 0 : 1), (6 : 18 : 1), (27 : 144 : 1), (336678 : 195353910 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (3 : 0 : 1), (6 : -18 : 1), (27 : 144 : 1), (336678 : -195353910 : 1) ]
sage: E = EllipticCurve("1848i1")
sage: E.integral_points()
[(2 : 3 : 1), (3206 : 181557 : 1)]
sage: magma(E).IntegralPoints()
[ (2 : 3 : 1), (3206 : 181557 : 1) ]
```
That is using vanilla Sage (i.e. without any patches from this ticket).
I am about to do a more systematic test.

Positive review.  In my reviewer's patch I fix  the following:

0. Now applies to 4.7.2 with no fuzz.
1. Added QQ to import list on line 332 of ell_number_field.py, otherwise testing ell_int_pts failed, but testing ell_number_field did not -- since the test for that function silverman_height_bounds was incomplete!  I fixed that too.
2. Fixed a warning in docbuild by adding a blank line at line 69 of the same file.

It is now true that for an elliptic curve E over Q we have both the new E.silverman_height_bounds(), which gives lower and upper bounds, and the old E.silverman_height_bound(), which only gives one of them.  The latter can be deleted but that will require some tweaking of any code which uses it.  I have left that for another ticket.

The first curve where Sage-4.7.2 fails to find the same number of integral points as Magma V2.17-9 is 2082a1 where Sage-4.7.2 finds x-coordinates -11,-2,4,13 but not 507525709 (!).  But the new version does find that last one.

I will carry on testing, but there is no need to delay merging this (expect perhaps if I find a curve for which the new code fails to find all known points).

For all curves of conductor up to 10000, there are precisely 3 where Sage-4.7.2 misses integral points compared with Magma V2.17-9, namely 2082a1, 6104b1, 8470g1, 8470g2;  in each case just one point is missed.  And the new code agrees with Magma in all these cases.  Regarding timings, up to 10000 Sage-4.7.2 took 157m while Magma took 943m;  that may be an unfair comparison though since Sage took generators from the DB while Magma (I think) computed them from scratch.  I will redo this with the current patch applied.

I unfortunately get several doctest failures (with sage-4.8.alpha2 + various patches).  Did you test this patch with the new PARI (merged in sage-4.8.alpha1)?  I am also afraid that there are speed regressions, I am seeing a timeout:

I checked that the new patch applies fine and passes most tests (all tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves except one, see below).  I want to do more testing now, to test on a large range of conductors that (over QQ) we find the same integral points as Magma.

This seems to be simply a formatting difference:

More seriously, 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('9615d1)

```
seems to hang, thought I don't know why, while 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('9615d1)

```
is fine.  I think that this will need investigating before this can be merged.  Hence "needs work".

With the old algorithm in Sage for N<10000 there are only 3 cases where Sage missed integral points.  Of these, 3 (6104b1, 8470g1 and 8470g2), are very easily fixed, simply by increasing the precision of the function `integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coeffs` from 100 to 200, thogh I have not done the necessary analysis to compute the actual precision required.  The other one is 2082a1, where the MW group is cyclic of rank 1 and the integral multiples of the generator P are n*P for n=1,2,3,4,13, but the bound computed by the algorithm is 12.  It should be possible to find that bug using a detailed analysis of the implementation, but I have not done that yet (though I did find one small bug, in the formula for mu there should be b2/12 and not b2).

Because I am actively working on it!  Seriously, comparing in detail Smart's paper and book and Nook's account in his thesis, I have found two things: (1) Smart does not deal properly with torsion generators, Nook does and that is in this code but I think I might be able to do better; (2) more seriously, Smart derived an upper bound for `|x(P)^2\psi(P)|` (relative to each embedding) which only valid for points with `|x(P)|` bounded below by some quantity (in the appropriate embedding), and this means that there are points, possible integral, which fail this condition and need to be considered separately.  Over Q that is easily done by searching on a finite x-interval, but over a general number field it is not clear to me that the "missing" points are in a finite region.  However,  I am working on a bound (which certainly exists) for `|x(P)^2\psi(P)|` valid for all complex points with any embedding, and when that is done I will be changing some of the constants in the code.

I am not expecting the output to be different in any of the examples (but who knows), but I cannot let this in when I have identified but not yet fixed this mathematical bug!

I have merged the current working branch in with 8.6.beta1 and resolved the conflicts.

I also made the following test:  there are 207 curves in the database (conductors < 400000, curves defined over QQ) where the old E.integral_points() missed integral points, as I found out by running every curve through Magma's IntegralPoints function.  For every one of these the current version finds all the points (the same as Magma does).

However I still think that this code is too slow over QQ and intend to make a new branch (and a new ticket #27015) to fix the problems over QQ.  When that is done I will get back to this branch.

Correction to the above:  it was true that there were 207 curves whose lists of integral points at http://johncremona.github.io/ecdata/ (since updated) were incomplete, and hence also the integral points stored in the LMFDB (not yet updated).  However, in all but 3 of these cases (2082a1, 23808e1, 285928a1) the current Sage (8.5) finds all the points.  So previous bug fixes have helped.

In the negative direction there are some more discrepancies, since we now (using vanilla 8.5) miss x=20829482 on 1701d1 and x=176 and 179 on 1848f1.  (There will surely be more).  

The complete list of missed points with Sage 8.5 is: 12 points on 11 curves:

 1701d1, 1848f1, 2082a1, 3510n1, 6514b1,
 177211a1,
 23808e1,
 268740c1,
 285928a1,
 66432f1,
 92554e1,

missing 1 point in each case except 2 points on 1848f1.

#27015 will deal with this.
