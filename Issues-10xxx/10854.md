This spkg updates sqlalchemy to 0.6.6: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sqlalchemy-0.6.6.spkg

On the one hand, sqlalchemy doesn't appear to be used in Sage:

```
~/sage/devel/sage/sage% grep -ri "sqlalchemy" *
databases/database.py:#    - wrap sqlalchemy 
```

On the other hand, we will "soon" be using it for the new notebook, so it might be premature to cut it out of Sage.  At any rate, it is useful for experiments with the new notebook to have an updated spkg.
