Attachment: **[trac_10630_multi_partitions.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10630/trac_10630_multi_partitions.patch.gz)**

Some comments:

* The functions for multipartitions do not seem to work correctly. Here is an incorrect (incomplete) result:

```
 
M=MultiPartitions([2,2])
for x in M.list(): print x
[[2, 2]]
[[1, 2], [1, 0]]
[[2, 1], [0, 1]]
[[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 2]]
[[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
[[2, 0], [0, 1], [0, 1]]
[[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 1]]

```
  Two multipartitions are missed: `[[1,1],[1,1]]` and `[[2,0],[0,2]]`

* I wonder whether `MultiPartitions` is a good name, because it seems it has a different meaning in a near context. See for instance this paper by G. Andrews: http://es.scribd.com/doc/6625886/Multi-Partitions, or this other paper; http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~mf/papers/weight2.pdf, or these slides: http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~goddard/MINI/2009/Swisher.pdf ."Vector partitions" may be safer (it is used for instance by George Andrews in his book on partitions).

* Should one represent the Multipartitions as lists of vectors with integer coordinates rather than lists of lists ? (because sometimes one has to do the sum of the parts).

* A few typos:
   * Line 6 of the file: "the" should not be repeated.
   * Line 9 of the file: replace "it's" with "its".
   * Line 63 of the file: replace "lexicographically order integer lists" with "lexicographically weakly decreasing lists of integers" or something better.
   * Also, one might replace the definition of multipartition as "equivalence class of tuples" (lines 4 to 10) with "multiset of tuples".
