I didn't know that is sometimes used as a definition of "outer product", but Wikipedia backs you up on it.

In other languages, "exterior product" translates to the same word as "outer product", so a -1 from me for having this definition of outer product. I think this term will be a source of confusion.

If someone needs the tensor product, it is easy enough to get via the one-liner

```
lambda v,w: matrix(len(v),len(w),[a*b for a in v for b in w])
```

Hi Nils,

Thanks for the comments.  Since vectors are neither rows nor columns in Sage, any notion of a transpose is irrelevant.  The outer product just is what it is.  I could delete the mention of the transpose in the mathematical description in the docstring.

"Someone" are 19-year-old students, who shouldn't need to understand a lambda function to learn linear algebra.

Sage can work well with a column-oriented approach - it just needs a few things.  Check out:

> "Someone" are 19-year-old students, who shouldn't need to understand a lambda function to learn linear algebra.


Slightly off-topic: If you don't want lambda and v,w are the vectors you want to take the kronecker product of:

```
matrix([[a*b for b in w] for a in v])
```
(to avoid depending on the order in which python iterates through a multiple "for")

On-topic: In Dutch "uitprodukt" and in German "auseres produkt" is "exterior product" (as in "wedge product" or "cross product"). These terms literally translate to "outer product". I don't know about french. That's why I think "outer product" is better avoided, because it likely causes confusion.

(truly off-topic: Do you think you are doing 19-year olds a service by teaching them kronecker products of column x row vectors? Cross products of 3-dim vectors are probably much more useful for them and having to juggle 3 (instead of 2) ways of taking products of vectors is probably more confusing for them)

Thanks, Jeroen.  Coercion/error-trapping got changed somehow, and I've asked about it on sage-devel.  New patch just adjusts the doctest to a pair of rings that behave better and make the same point, and this is really a matrix multiplication error message anyway.

I'll see if I can get a review here at Sage Days 29.  ;-)

Should this be compared with the "tensor_product" method of matrices?  Should "outer_product" have "tensor_product" as a synonym? (According to wikipedia, it should.) For reasons I don't understand, the tensor product of matrices comes equipped with subdivisions, but other than that, 

```
sage: v.outer_product(w)
```
and 

```
sage: m1 = matrix(v).transpose()
sage: m2 = matrix(w)
sage: m1.tensor_product(m2)
```
should produce the same thing.

Attachment [trac_10545-vector-outer-product-doc.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket10545/trac_10545-vector-outer-product-doc.patch) by @rbeezer created at 2011-03-23 23:12:31

Replacement "doc" patch is still almost all documentation, but now includes a "tensor_product" synonym as suggested.

New doctest compares it with the matrix version of a tensor product.
