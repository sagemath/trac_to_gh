Franco, you are right. The standard location is `tests/french_book` where there is already
the Python file corresponding to #9395.

Oops, sorry. I'll revert to needs_work then!
As well, there are tests that ought to be broken into several subtests - as they are really long sequences of independent tests.
Would be great if this it taken care of, too.

By breaking tests into several subtests, did you think test as file or as code line ? 
Shall I break the files 'graphique*.py' and 'sol_graphiques*.py' into shortest files ?

Yes, this looks like a good idea . 
Perhaps there is also a way to have several independent tests in one file, I don't know.

Of course you can have several independent tests in one file, just like you can have more than one function or more than one class in a file.  Just put several test blocks in the file:

```
r"""
test1
"""

r"""
test2
"""
```
instead of

```
r"""
test1
test2
"""
```

Attached you will find the test files corrected.

The too long tests were commented: # long time

Does that sound correct ?

Here are the execution time :

```
$ for i in *.py ; do sage -t $i; done; 
sage -t  "calculus_fixed.py"                                
	 [11.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 11.2 seconds
sage -t  "graphique_1_fixed.py"                             
	 [14.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 15.0 seconds
sage -t  "graphique_2_fixed.py"                             
	 [19.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 19.4 seconds
sage -t  "graphique_3_fixed.py"                             
	 [8.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 8.4 seconds
sage -t  "sol_calculus_fixed.py"                            
	 [8.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 9.0 seconds
sage -t  "sol_graphiques_1_fixed.py"                        
	 [13.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 13.1 seconds
sage -t  "sol_graphiques_2_fixed.py"                        
	 [4.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.8 seconds
```

And with the long tests :

```
$ for i in *.py ; do sage -t -long $i; done; 
sage -t -long "calculus_fixed.py"                           
	 [11.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 11.3 seconds
sage -t -long "graphique_1_fixed.py"                        
	 [323.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 323.1 seconds
sage -t -long "graphique_2_fixed.py"                        
	 [20.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 20.3 seconds
sage -t -long "graphique_3_fixed.py"                        
	 [8.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 8.1 seconds
sage -t -long "sol_calculus_fixed.py"                       
	 [8.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 9.0 seconds
sage -t -long "sol_graphiques_1_fixed.py"                   
	 [47.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 47.3 seconds
sage -t -long "sol_graphiques_2_fixed.py"                   
	 [64.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 65.0 seconds
```


It was the execution of the following instruction that is very long :

```
sage: f = lambda x, y : (abs(cos((x + I * y) ** 4)) - 1)
sage: g2 = implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3), plot_points=400) # long time 
```

I have made a new patch with correct indentations.

Unfortunately, there are now 2 doctest errors with simplify_full !!!

<div id="comment:33" align="right">Comment 33</div>

the second doctest failure looks like a regression in Sage, since the expression `2*e` is not simplified similarly to `e`:

```
sage: e=log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)) + log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 1))
sage: e.simplify_full()
-log(2)
sage: (2*e).simplify_full()
2*log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) + 1)) + 2*log(1/2*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2) - 1))
```
Should I open a ticket for that?

Just as in the patch proposed, you may chain simplifies, getting 

```
sage: (2*e).simplify_log().simplify_full()
-log(4)
```
Not sure it's a Maxima regression, or a proper Sage regression. Opening a trac ticket won't hurt, I suppose.
