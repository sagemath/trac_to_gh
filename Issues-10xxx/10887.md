Scipy 0.9 was released a few days ago.  We should upgrade.  There was at least one person that was having problems with the scipy in Sage, and the fix is in 0.9.

This should preferably be merged along with numpy-1.5.1 (#10792).

Support for SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS will be added later in a different ticket.

I have looked a little bit more in depth at that. I noticed that in Gentoo scipy-0.9.0 now pulls qhull as a dependency. If there a version of libqhull.{so,a} on the system it will be used rather than the internally built static library. Said static library is not installed by scipy just rolled up in their created module.

In summary this version of scipy includes libqhull functionality (as far as scipy uses it at least) but doesn't provide the qhull library or any of the executables built by qhull normally.

Depending on what you want to do I think that means you don't want to remove qhull from the optional spkg unless you want to force access to its functionality through the scipy interface.

For info it also bundles superLU from experimental in the same way.

OK so my big doctest failure will turn out to be Gentoo specific because we don't have scipy_sandbox and relied on arpack functionality included in scipy. Arpack is also bundled in scipy so presumably we could switch to using 

```
from scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen.arpack import arpack
```
instead of 

```

```
there are a few other things to clean afterwards but nothing serious. 
The functionality has been shipped in scipy for a while. The other part of scipy_sandbox (delaunay) can be provided by matplotlib so we could drop scipy_sandbox altogether but that would be another ticket.

I think this ticket should be merged at the same time or after numpy-1.5.1 (#10792) otherwise scipy will need artificial bumping when numpy is merged.

I should get on with that spkg, I had forgotten that I didn't make one.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

Here is the spkg [http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/scipy-0.9.spkg](http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/scipy-0.9.spkg) I actually have no idea on how to build the doc. Which is why I didn't add support for SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS. 

After testing I can confirm the issue with matrix_double_dense.pyx. numerical/test.py pass without problems as expected. So what needs to be done:
* add support for installing the docs
* patch matrix_double_dense.pyx

I would say that if this is nontrivial, it is better to get the new numpy and scipy in before next week's Sage Days, where many Numpy devels will be around.  We can always add another patch and ticket for this later.

Patch to Sage library looks fine and applies to 4.7.alpha1.

New spkg installs and builds.

Combination of the two passes all tests with "make ptestlong".

This is the first time I've reviewed an spkg upgrade.  Is there more to be done?  If so, feel free to flip this back to "needs work."

In theory, one should check if the spkg is properly formed, by unpacking it, reading any changes, and making sure that when one `sage -pkg`s it back up there are no red flags (e.g., unchecked changes).

As far as I know they do. They are somewhat orthogonal and could be upgraded separately  without trouble. But you want to have scipy rebuilt after a numpy upgrade for "safety".

They certainly play well together on sage-on-gentoo, I now have many copies of "vanilla" sage all over the place with various patches and upgrades. I am not sure I have one with both but it wouldn't surprise me.
