The patch contains the implementation of the generalized associahedron, as constructed in [CFZ] Chapoton, Fomin, Zelevinsky - Polytopal realizations of the generalized associahedra, http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0202004.

```
sage: Associahedron(['A',3])
Generalized associahedron of type ['A', 3] with 14 vertices
```

The class inherits from Polyhedra, and uses several new methods for root spaces:

- `RootLatticeRealization`.index_bipartition, returns the bipartition of the indices of the Dynkin diagram vertices, if it is bipartite

- `RootLatticeRealization`.almost_positive_roots, returns the sorted list of positive and simple negative roots

- `RootLatticeRealization`.tau_plus_minus, returns two piecewise linear operators on the root space which are used to define the "tropical Coxeter element" in [CFZ]

- `RootLatticeRealization`.almost_positive_root_decomposition, returns the orbit decomposition of the almost positive roots under the dihedral group action of < tau_plus, tau_minus > as defined above

**Keywords:** associahedra

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Christian Stump

**Reviewer:** Frédéric Chapoton, Nicolas M. Thiéry

**Merged:** sage-5.0.beta8

Ok, I finally could do it. The patch is on the queue. If you are happy with it, you may fold the two patches, upload them here, and set a positive review on my behalf.

The buildbot doesn't find the failure, and the list has actually the same content. So the problem must be something with the cmp of inequalities.

I wouldn't know how to fix that in this patch actually.

What about:

```
    sage: sorted(Asso.Hrepresentation(), key=repr)
    [An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (1, 1) x + 1 >= 0]
```

Then the result should be sorted according to their string
representation, and string comparison should be platform independent.

Thanks! Positive review, assuming the tests pass.

> how can I know that string representations should be platform independent and some others aren't?


Because:

- I am amost certain that Python compares strings lexicographically (it does for e.g. tuples; see http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html; it's certainly specified somewhere for strings too)
- The Inequality class implements `_repr_` independently of the platform
- On the other hand, this class does not implement `__cmp__`, so its behavior is unspecified. And likely to be platform dependent.

The buildbot somehow doesn't like the test

```
for root in L.almost_positive_roots():
         print 'tau({:<41}) ='.format(root), tau(root)

I guess, you added it, didn't you? On my 5.0.beta6, it passed though.
