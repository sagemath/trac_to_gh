hgignore is  missing and and hg repo not clean, preventing working with hg queues. As well, SPKG out of date.

All this is fixed in 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/lapack-20071123.p2.spkg
 
Reviewing this should be really trivial...

Having created a ticket to make a new version, I realise this is more complex than I thought, as the library names used by the new version are all different, so will take more work. 

This looks good. Positive review.
