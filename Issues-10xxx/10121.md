hgignore is  missing and and hg repo not clean, preventing working with hg queues. As well, SPKG out of date.

All this is fixed in

Reviewing this should be really trivial...

Having created a ticket to make a new version, I realise this is more complex than I thought, as the library names used by the new version are all different, so will take more work.
