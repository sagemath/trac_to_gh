The current setuptools version in Sage is 0.6c9. However, in the 0.6c11 update, there's an important change:

```
 * Fixes for various dependency management problems such as looping builds, 
   re-downloading packages already present on sys.path (but not in a registered
   "site" directory), and semi-randomly preferring local "-f" packages over
   local installed packages
```

The problem in the PyCUDA package with a corrupted setuptools ( https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10010 ) after installing distribute is caused due to this outdated setuptools version.

The package is really simple (like the current 0.6c9 package), because it has no patches compared to the vanilla setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools . Therefore, I just copied in the new source and that was it.

**CC:**  @jaapspies

**Keywords:** distribute

**Reviewer:** Mariah Lenox

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

(Almost) regardless of its size, never attach a binary file on trac... ;-)

Instead, put a link to it on the ticket, and perhaps attach an spkg diff or Mercurial patch to the ticket for reference / review.

If you don't have a sagemath account (or some other place to upload it), you can use http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/ .

I think I've already made such an spkg IIRC, with further clean-up a while ago. Let me see...

Ah, no. I looked at the 0.6c11, but did not make a new spkg, but only patched the 0.6c9 with some "debug" code, adding more messages regarding the handling of `.pth` files with which we had trouble.

I'll take a look at your spkg.

I've attached a patch to `spkg-install`.


Koen: You haven't updated `SPKG.txt`.

(I haven't either.) Can you do that and provide an updated spkg somewhere else (with also my patch applied)?

I'll then ask someone powerful to remove the spkg attached to the ticket.

*Somewhere*? :)

Every spkg has its Mercurial repository (`.hg`), which contains the Sage part of the spkg, but not the upstream code (`src/`, which is in `.hgignore`).

So you just have to `hg commit` and provide a commit message, starting with the ticket number (`#10361`), and a brief (one-line) description. (You can optionally *in addition* provide a longer description, e.g. a copy of your Changelog entry, below that first and a blank line.)

You may have to create/edit your `~/.hgrc` first, such that Mercurial adds the proper name and e-mail address.

I'll see how you applied my patch without using Mercurial(?)... You should have perhaps first updated `SPKG.txt`, committed your changes, and then `hg import /path/to/my/patch`.

P.S.:

In case you want to update your spkg at spkg-upload, **first delete the old one**, then you can (re-)upload a new one with the same name.

We usually provide the md5sum of an spkg along with the (raw) download link on the ticket, (also) to avoid confusion with previous versions.

Ok, the `.exe` files are back, but they're quite small (8 KB each).

The changelog entry should name the whole spkg (base)name (i.e. setuptools-0.6c11**.p0**), and it's convenient to also have the ticket number in the changelog, but I don't mind.

I've tested it with both Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 and alpha3, also by reinstalling SageNB (which uses setuptools).

So if you are ok with my changes, too, we have a positive review.

I'm responding to Leif's email for the .spkg to be deleted, so I've done it. 

Note, that .spkg's should **never** be attached to trac. The system is not set up to handle large files, which .spkg's generally are. (In fact, I've lost count the number of times trac stops working because a file system is full) 

Please instead put them on a server of some sort and provide a link with and ideally state the md5 checksum too. 

Note William will give any Sage developer an account on the *.math.washington.edu network. Since your home directory is then publicly readable, just stick .spkg's in your home directory, or probably more logically make a sub-directory and stick them there. 

Here's my directory - I should clean some of the older ones out!
