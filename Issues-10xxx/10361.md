```
The current setuptools version in Sage is 0.6c9. However, in the 0.6c11 update, there's an important change:

```
 * Fixes for various dependency management problems such as looping builds, 
   re-downloading packages already present on sys.path (but not in a registered
   "site" directory), and semi-randomly preferring local "-f" packages over
   local installed packages
```

The problem in the PyCUDA package with a corrupted setuptools ( http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10010 ) after installing distribute is caused due to this outdated setuptools version.

The package is really simple (like the current 0.6c9 package), because it has no patches compared to the vanilla setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools . Therefore, I just copied in the new source and that was it.

<a id='comment:2'></a>(Almost) regardless of its size, never attach a binary file on trac... ;-)

Instead, put a link to it on the ticket, and perhaps attach an spkg diff or Mercurial patch to the ticket for reference / review.

If you don't have a sagemath account (or some other place to upload it), you can use http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/ .

I think I've already made such an spkg IIRC, with further clean-up a while ago. Let me see...

Ah, no. I looked at the 0.6c11, but did not make a new spkg, but only patched the 0.6c9 with some "debug" code, adding more messages regarding the handling of `.pth` files with which we had trouble.

I'll take a look at your spkg.

*Somewhere*? :)

Every spkg has its Mercurial repository (`.hg`), which contains the Sage part of the spkg, but not the upstream code (`src/`, which is in `.hgignore`).

So you just have to `hg commit` and provide a commit message, starting with the ticket number (`#10361`), and a brief (one-line) description. (You can optionally *in addition* provide a longer description, e.g. a copy of your Changelog entry, below that first and a blank line.)

You may have to create/edit your `~/.hgrc` first, such that Mercurial adds the proper name and e-mail address.

I'll see how you applied my patch without using Mercurial(?)... You should have perhaps first updated `SPKG.txt`, committed your changes, and then `hg import /path/to/my/patch`.

Ok, the `.exe` files are back, but they're quite small (8 KB each).

The changelog entry should name the whole spkg (base)name (i.e. setuptools-0.6c11**.p0**), and it's convenient to also have the ticket number in the changelog, but I don't mind.

I've tested it with both Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 and alpha3, also by reinstalling SageNB (which uses setuptools).

So if you are ok with my changes, too, we have a positive review.
