Did that ever work?  I think the code assumes that a symbolic function is given:

```
sage: f(x,y)=x+y
sage: plot_slope_field(f,(x,-3,4),(y,-2,2) )

Should apply cleanly now.

All tests passed on my machine.  However, plotting the doctest gave several warnings before finally plotting the function.  Should we maybe check for divide by zero cases or other such cases?
