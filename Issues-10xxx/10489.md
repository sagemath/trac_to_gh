rebased patch against sage-4.6.1
Should apply cleanly now.

All tests passed on my machine.  However, plotting the doctest gave several warnings before finally plotting the function.  Should we maybe check for divide by zero cases or other such cases?

Yes, but that is a separate issue from this ticket, so we should open a new ticket for that.  In fact, I seem to remember that a ticket was opened several years ago for the divide by zero issue.
