I've also seen this on my OS X box from time to time.

I view "something strange is up with the doctexting framework" as a different bug than "the sage0 doctests are flakey," and the latter has a fix now while the former is who knows how long out. I don't consider it covering the bug to re-factor the doctest to be less rigid but still test what's being tested for.

I could patch my bot, but ideally many people will be running patchbots on several different machines, and it'd be nice if people could just run the latest release, rather than the latest release + this patch.
