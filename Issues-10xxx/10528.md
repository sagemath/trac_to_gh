I've also seen this on my OS X box from time to time.

I view "something strange is up with the doctexting framework" as a different bug than "the sage0 doctests are flakey," and the latter has a fix now while the former is who knows how long out. I don't consider it covering the bug to re-factor the doctest to be less rigid but still test what's being tested for.
