This is similar to, but different to, #10745.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0,0,-6664,86543])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(2, 3, [(173 : 1943 : 1), (-73 : -394 : 1), (323/4 : 1891/8 : 1)])
sage: E.rank()
3
sage: E.gens()
[(-73 : -394 : 1), (323/4 : 1891/8 : 1), (173 : 1943 : 1)]
```
This is _wrong_.  The rank is 2;  the first point in the output has order 4.  The mistake is that in discarding torsion points from the generators of E/2E, only points of exact order 2 are omitted!

Works fine on snow leopard 10.6.6.

But I'm not sure I understand. Sure, the "rank" should be returned as 2, but if I ask for the generators - shouldn't we get the generators of the torsion as well?
I'm simply thinking of consistency with other groups such as unit groups.
The rank of the unit group of the cyclotomic field QQ(\zeta_5) is 1, but there are two generators (and sage does return 2).

Welcome! 

You are absolutely right from the mathematical point of view, the generators should really include 0, 1 or 2 torsion generators.  But there is a tradition with elliptic curves of using "generators" to mean "generators modulo torsion", and I think that to change the behaviour to what you suggest would break a lot of code, hence a Bad Thing.

On the other hand it would be very reasonable to expect the docstring to be more precise, and in fact it is:  for curves over Q the docstring for gens clearly states that it returns generaotors modulo torsion;  while for curves over other number fields it just says 

```
Returns some generators of this elliptic curve. Check ``rank()`` or
       ``rank_bounds()`` to verify the number of generators.
```
so the user is not being misled.
