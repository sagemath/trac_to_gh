Although the -q option to grep is defined by POSIX, many older greps do not implement this. Even the man page of `grep` on a Linux machine says not to use -q or -s on scripts that are supposed to be portable. 

The grep in /usr/bin on Solaris does not support the option. This is done by Sun to maintain backward compatibility with older versions which did not support it. So this causes a problem. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.1.alpha0$ make
spkg/pipestatus "cd spkg && ./install all 2>&1" "tee -a ../install.log"
grep: illegal option -- q
Usage: grep -hblcnsviw pattern file . . .
```

POSIX says:

```
-q
    Quiet. Nothing shall be written to the standard output, regardless of matching lines. Exit with zero status if an input line is selected.
```

so it is quite easy to work around. In general, 

The -q option only suppresses the output. The exit code is then used to determine if there was a match or not - 0 if if there was a math, 1 if there was not.

That exit code works on Solaris too, so it's only necessary to drop the -q and send the output to /dev/null.

```
grep -q sometext somefile
```

needs to be changed to

```
grep sometext somefile > /dev/null
```

Post-mortem comment: ;-)

In general I'm not very happy with avoiding POSIX options just because some people don't set their `PATH` properly.

IMHO Sage's `configure` should handle such. We're not building `gcc`, nor do we support last millenium's systems...

(Btw, `egrep` and `echo -n` aren't very portable in that sense either. If we only use the smallest subset of all systems or program versions one could think of, the code gets unreadable and harder to maintain.)

Fortunately, `sage-upgrade` won't get very large (I hope), but that's not the case for other uses of `grep -q`. Abusing `sed` is IMHO not an option (see above).

Ask Oracle... ;-)

(The POSIX-conformant versions aren't in the default `PATH`, for "compatibility" reasons.)

Of course the fact the default path does not always have POSIX options is a little unfortunate, but does mean Solaris has excellent backward compatibility. A 20 years old SunOS binary will still run today on Solaris. 

I do occasionally build Sage on the 2005 edition of Solaris 10, and it works on the latest revision. 

The same can not be said for Linux, where it seems that there is a never ending battle of keeping things working as the operating systems are updated. 

* ECL does not work on Fedora 14 -  #10185
* Readline not work on the latest Arch or openSUSE #9530
* etc, etc etc.

**I've yet to see one single example of where Sage builds on an old version of Solaris, but not on a newer one.**
 
It should also be noted that Linux does not ship with POSIX commands - `ls`, `df`, `du` being 3 simple examples. But there are tons of them.

Like it or not, to create portable code, it is best to test on multiple platforms and whenever possible work around non-portable options. In a case like `grep` it is trivial.
