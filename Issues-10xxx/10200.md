When Sphinx gives a warning or error but continues, the user will usually never notice.  I propose that `doc/common/builder.py` should look for these errors and warnings and abort if a problem is found.

^C
$ echo $?
130
```
Because of this, exit codes are usually in the range ![0,127].  Some programs use higher numbers to indicate more serious errors (say: 1 for normal errors, 2 for serious errors), but this is not a general rule.

I will provide a patch with better documented exit codes.

Thanks for the review.

However, there is one important issue with this patch: if Sphinx gives warnings about latex being unavailable, this patch will also make that into an error (which is not desirable).

So this is what I will do: wait for #10118 to have positive_review, then fix the latex WARNING issue, then merge this patch.

<div id="comment:14" align="right">comment:14</div>

There is another issue with this patch:

`sage/misc/sagedoc.py` (very stupidly) reads the first 1000 bytes of `doc/common/builder.py` and searches for this part:

```
SAGE_DOC = os.environ['SAGE_DOC']
LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']
SPHINXOPTS  = ""
PAPER       = ""
OMIT        = ["introspect"]  # docs/dirs to omit when listing and building 'all'
```
In particular, it needs the "LANGUAGES" and "OMIT" variables.

By adding my patch, these options are no longer in the first 1000 bytes.  I believe we should use some Pythonic mechanism (`import` doesn't seem to work since this file is in `doc/`, not `sage/`) to read these options instead of essentially grepping stuff from `builder.py`.  Any ideas...?
