When Sphinx gives a warning or error but continues, the user will usually never notice.  I propose that `doc/common/builder.py` should look for these errors and warnings and abort if a problem is found.

I disagree.  `errno` is meant for C functions like `fopen()`.  I have never seen these used as exit codes for a program.

> Better still, for my benefit could you please point me to relevant documentation explaining exit code for the particular situations under consideration?

I'm afraid there are not much standards about exit codes.  The main thing is that 0 means success and anything else means failure.  Also, many operation systems (if not all) use 1 byte for the exit code, so the range is ![0,255].

bash uses 128+`sig` as exit code when a process fails with signal `sig`.  For example, type `cat` (without arguments) and press CTRL-C.  Then the exit code will be 130 (= 128 + 2 with `SIGINT` == 2):

```
$ cat
^C
$ echo $?
130
```
Because of this, exit codes are usually in the range ![0,127].  Some programs use higher numbers to indicate more serious errors (say: 1 for normal errors, 2 for serious errors), but this is not a general rule.

I will provide a patch with better documented exit codes.

Thanks for the review.

However, there is one important issue with this patch: if Sphinx gives warnings about latex being unavailable, this patch will also make that into an error (which is not desirable).

So this is what I will do: wait for #10118 to have positive_review, then fix the latex WARNING issue, then merge this patch.

There is another issue with this patch:

`sage/misc/sagedoc.py` (very stupidly) reads the first 1000 bytes of `doc/common/builder.py` and searches for this part:

```
SAGE_DOC = os.environ['SAGE_DOC']
LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']
SPHINXOPTS  = ""
PAPER       = ""
OMIT        = ["introspect"]  # docs/dirs to omit when listing and building 'all'
```
In particular, it needs the "LANGUAGES" and "OMIT" variables.

By adding my patch, these options are no longer in the first 1000 bytes.  I believe we should use some Pythonic mechanism (`import` doesn't seem to work since this file is in `doc/`, not `sage/`) to read these options instead of essentially grepping stuff from `builder.py`.  Any ideas...?
