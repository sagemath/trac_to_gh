When Sphinx gives a warning or error but continues, the user will usually never notice.  I propose that `doc/common/builder.py` should look for these errors and warnings and abort if a problem is found.

Btw, the component should be "documentation" I think.

I'm mostly OK with jdemeyer's patch [attachment: 10200_docbuilder.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10200/10200_docbuilder.patch.gz). But I also made some changes as follows:

* Don't use the backslash character "\" for line continuation. Line continuation is already implied by the opening parenthesis.

* Fix typos introduced by the patch [attachment: 10200_docbuilder.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10200/10200_docbuilder.patch.gz).

* Use

 ```python
 <name> is not None
 ```
 instead of

 ```python
 not <name> is None
 ```

* Use symbolic names of exit code as documented at http://docs.python.org/library/errno.html, rather than hard-code the actual numeric values.
 
See the ticket description for instructions on which patches to apply. If my patch gets a positive review, then the whole ticket gets a positive review.

I disagree.  `errno` is meant for C functions like `fopen()`.  I have never seen these used as exit codes for a program.

I'm afraid there are not much standards about exit codes.  The main thing is that 0 means success and anything else means failure.  Also, many operation systems (if not all) use 1 byte for the exit code, so the range is ![0,255].

bash uses 128+`sig` as exit code when a process fails with signal `sig`.  For example, type `cat` (without arguments) and press CTRL-C.  Then the exit code will be 130 (= 128 + 2 with `SIGINT` == 2):

```
$ cat
^C
$ echo $?
130
```
Because of this, exit codes are usually in the range ![0,127].  Some programs use higher numbers to indicate more serious errors (say: 1 for normal errors, 2 for serious errors), but this is not a general rule.

I will provide a patch with better documented exit codes.

Thanks for the review.

However, there is one important issue with this patch: if Sphinx gives warnings about latex being unavailable, this patch will also make that into an error (which is not desirable).

So this is what I will do: wait for #10118 to have positive_review, then fix the latex WARNING issue, then merge this patch.

<a id='comment:14'>Comment 14:</a>
There is another issue with this patch:

`sage/misc/sagedoc.py` (very stupidly) reads the first 1000 bytes of `doc/common/builder.py` and searches for this part:

```
SAGE_DOC = os.environ['SAGE_DOC']
LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr']
SPHINXOPTS  = ""
PAPER       = ""
OMIT        = ["introspect"]  # docs/dirs to omit when listing and building 'all'
```
In particular, it needs the "LANGUAGES" and "OMIT" variables.

By adding my patch, these options are no longer in the first 1000 bytes.  I believe we should use some Pythonic mechanism (`import` doesn't seem to work since this file is in `doc/`, not `sage/`) to read these options instead of essentially grepping stuff from `builder.py`.  Any ideas...?

Closing this ticket as "wontfix" since Sphinx warnings can sometimes simply indicate a missing `dvipng` for example.  We should not punish the user for that.
