The dimension of an ideal, that is the Krull dimension of the quotient `R/I`, does not depend on the monomial order. But 

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')
sage: P.ideal(x).dimension()
1
sage: P.ideal(x-1).dimension()
-1
```
I think this uses Singular "ls" ordering which is related to the localization at `<x,y>` though I have never used (or properly understood) that functionality in Singular. 

Maybe we need to change the term order to a global one internally?

More fundamentally, a (Krull) dimension should not be negative, should it?

Apparently some other things go wrong : 

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')
sage: 1 in P.ideal(x-1)
True
sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[1]
```

This is obviously crazy. And membership inside an ideal should not depend on the term order:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: sage: 1 in P.ideal(x-1)
False
sage: sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[x - 1]
```

The problem *could* be caused by the fact that `neglex` is not a "monomial order" in the usual sense, as it is not Well-founded:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order='neglex')
sage: 1 > x > x^2 > x^3 > x^4
True
```

This clearly is an infinite descending chain.

More generally, it seems that the problem occurs with all the "negated" term orders.

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')
sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[1]
```

With "negdegrevlex":

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='negdegrevlex')
sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[1]
```

With "negdeglex":

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='negdeglex')
sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[1]
```

With "negwdegrevlex"

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order=TermOrder('negwdegrevlex',(1,2)))
sage: P.ideal(x-1).groebner_basis()
[1]
```

Digging deeper into this, it seems that we imported from singular the concepts of *global* and *local* orderings. The global ones match my own understanding of what a "monomial order" is. In singular they also allow a generalization thereof, by dropping the well-foundedness requirement (the "local" orderings are those such that 1 > x).

Pretty much everything will eventually rely on the groebner basis computation routine, which apparently only works properly on "global" orderings. So a cheap fix would consist in raising an exception in `I.groebner_basis` if the underlying term-order is not "global"...

Opinions?

In fact, the page of the reference manual on term orderings  specifies which orders are "global", but it does not specify what this means (this notion is not present in the textbooks I used to work with, and I suspect that some users won't know about it). It does not say that most routines are broken on the non-global orders. This could possibly be confusing to some users. We should at least mimic the [singular documentation on term orderings](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_801.htm), which is much more explicit and less confusing about all this.

I concur that "neglex" should not be allowed as a term order on a *polynomial ring*. Instead, we can have `LocalPolynomialRing` or something similar that interfaces somehow with this functionality in singular.

This looks like an abuse of terminology on the side of Singular. Probably one that is algorithmically very advantageous for them, but you clearly need to work very carefully with these rings, because there are now "units" in the ring for which the inverse is not expressible in the representation used:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')
sage: (1+x).is_unit()
True
sage: 1/(1+x)
1
sage: (1+x) * (1/(1+x))
1 + x
```

I am sure the functionality in singular is very useful, but we can't expose it in the way we're doing here.
