scipy_sandbox is picking up the wrong Fortran compiler (Sun compiler in /usr/bin) and ignoring the contents of the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage_fortran` This adds patch exports all 4 of these Fortran related variables, so scipy_sandbox uses the right compiler. 

For reasons unknown, following the update of Numpy (#9808), it 
became necessary to export these Fortran variables on both SciPy and
scipy_sandbox.

I also cleaned up SPKG.txt, as it was very bare.

I think you do have a caching problem. I just downloaded it myself with:

```
wget http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/scipy_sandbox-20071020.p6.spkg
```

and it looks fine. The Debian stuff is removed from the .spkg.

I think fulvia's `/bin/sh` does not support the compact `export FOO=bar`.  Maybe we should just make `spkg-install` a bash script?

David or Fran√ßois, could one of you please open a 4.6 blocker to fix this?

By the way, adding links to individual spkg logs is already on the Sage Buildbot TODO list.

You beat me to it by 30 seconds. Here is what I had to say

The main buildbot page is here:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/

The 'Waterfall display' seems the most interesting looking to me:

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/waterfall

* *fulvia* is the Solaris x86 machine at Skynet
* *hawk* (on far right) is my own personal OpenSolaris machine

I was not initially aware one could get the full log, but it is available. You have to click on the *build stdio* for the machine. 

http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/fulvia%20full/builds/6/steps/shell_1/logs/stdio

The relevant bit is:

I can now see what is wrong:

```
export FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
```

is a bashism - using export on the same line. But the spkg-install script starts with:

```
#!/bin/sh
```

The Solaris `/bin/sh` will not accept that syntax. (On OpenSolaris, a newer shell is used, which is why it worked on my machine).  

I've opened #10106 to address this. One could get around it by changing the shell used in the spkg-install, but personally I prefer to write code in a more portable fashion, so I'll change that later today. I've very tired and must get some sleep, so it will have to wait for 8 hours or so, unless someone else wants to beat me to it.
