Solve conics over number fields using PARI's rnfisnorm.

This is not meant to be efficient. Future patches can deal with that (such as #11455 for those who have Magma). Magma or #11455 can be used to check correctness of tests and documentation.

On sage 4.7 or higher, no patches from other tickets are needed.

Sorry I didn't make the September deadline...

Looks basically good, but I get some doctest failures after applying (successfully) to 4.8.alpha4:

```
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_rational_field.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py # 6 doctests failed
```
Mostly they are this:

```
     File "/home/jec/sage-4.8.alpha4/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py", line 249, in has_rational_point
        pt = self.point(T*vector([KtoB(isnorm[1][0]),
    NameError: global name 'vector' is not defined
```
and also there is this:

```
File "/home/jec/sage-4.8.alpha4/devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_number_field.py", line 290:
    sage: f = (2*O).factor(); f
Expected:
    (Fractional ideal (-a^2 - a + 1)) * (Fractional ideal (-a^2 + 2*a - 3))
Got:
    (Fractional ideal (-a^2 - a + 1)) * (Fractional ideal (a^2 - 2*a + 3))
```
which is of course trivial, and probably due to a Pari change in the interim. 

Fix these and I'll give it a positive review!
