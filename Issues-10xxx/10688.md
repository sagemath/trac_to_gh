The patch looks to me. You removed all instances of WEAVE that i could find.
weave has never been in sage-on-gentoo and it doesn't arm the doctest.
I am giving that one a positive review. I'll let #9791 to someone else more
familiar with the documentation.

I've never used weave, so I don't have anything new to add to the discussion. I support Jeroen's decision to remove the superfluous spkg, and the patch is how it should be done once the `sage_root` repository is in place.
