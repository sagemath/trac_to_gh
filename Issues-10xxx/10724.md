I've never heard those called beta number so my advice is to use the name "Frobenius coordinate". Maybe it's worth asking for a vote on `sage-combinat-devel`.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

Patch applies cleanly to sage-4.6.2.alpha2.

I get a strange error when giving beta number sequences with the wrong number of elements:

```
sage: Partition(beta_numbers=([6,3,2],[4,1]))

    310         b = beta_numbers[1]
    311         if len(a) <> len(b):
--> 312             raise ValueError, '%s is not a valid partition, the sequences of coordinates need to be the same length'%beta_numbers
    313             # should add tests to see if a and b are sorted down, nonnegative and strictly decreasing
    314     r = len(a)

TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
```

I was expecting to get a ValueError. I get the same strange error if I try:

```
sage: Partition(beta_numbers=([6,3,2],[4,1,-1]))
```
