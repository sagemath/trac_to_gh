Sorry, my description was incomplete: this ticket is not about the user interface, but the implementation. The purpose is to adapt the implementation of Sage's plain sparse free modules so that it also handles the infinite dimensional case (little needs to be changed). This is a step toward providing an alternative implementation of CombinatorialFreeModule using FreeModule as backend.

On the other hand, thanks for making FreeModule take an indexing set and delegate to CombinatorialFreeModule; we probably want to make this a separate ticket though.
