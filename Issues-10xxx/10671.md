Attachment [trac_10671-free_module_infinity-ts.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket10671/trac_10671-free_module_infinity-ts.patch) by @tscrim created at 2013-09-23 02:25:25

I made `FreeModule(K, oo)` return `CombinatorialFreeModule` indexed by `NonNegativeIntegers`, as well as made `FreeModule` be able to take an indexing set (which also redirects to `CombintorialFreeModule`).

On the other hand, thanks for making FreeModule take an indexing set and delegate to CombinatorialFreeModule; we probably want to make this a separate ticket though.
