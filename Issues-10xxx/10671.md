Attachment [trac_10671-free_module_infinity-ts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10671/trac_10671-free_module_infinity-ts.patch) by @tscrim created at 2013-09-23 02:25:25

I made `FreeModule(K, oo)` return `CombinatorialFreeModule` indexed by `NonNegativeIntegers`, as well as made `FreeModule` be able to take an indexing set (which also redirects to `CombintorialFreeModule`).

Sorry, my description was incomplete: this ticket is not about the user interface, but the implementation.

On the other hand, thanks for making FreeModule take an indexing set and delegate to CombinatorialFreeModule; we probably want to make this a separate ticket though.
