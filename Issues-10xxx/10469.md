```
This can currently happen because

* some scripts source it themselves (like e.g. at least `sage-spkg`, which is necessary since `sage-spkg` isn't always called through `sage-sage`, which also sources it),

* some receipts in the top-level `Makefile` source it before some other script is called through `sage-sage`,

* `sage-sage` itself or other (e.g. Python) code may run `sage ...` commands such that `sage-sage` is then called recursively, again sourcing `sage-env`.

To achieve this, we could simply add

```sh
# Don't execute the commands below more than once:
if [ -z "$SAGE_ENV_SOURCED" ]; then
    export SAGE_ENV_SOURCED=1  # or "yes", "true" or alike, but see below (versioning)
else
    # Already sourced, nothing to do.
    return 0
fi
```
near its top.

We *may* even put a version number into that variable and execute (perhaps only some of) the commands in `sage-env` "again" in case it was modified during running scripts, which could be helpful when upgrading Sage.

---

Such a variable also allows still generic, but safer tests than the usual `[ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]`, since `SAGE_LOCAL` being defined doesn't really imply `sage-env` was sourced, but we usually intend to ensure that some environment variables (like e.g. `CC` or `UNAME`) are properly set up, without testing each of these individually.

Effectively sourcing (at least parts of) `sage-env` only once also

* avoids redundant entries in `PATH` etc.,
* avoids special tests if some variable was already defined / modified (like e.g. `SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), also simplifying other scripts (cf. #10286),
* IMHO reduces the risk of unintentional side-effects, and
* speeds up execution.

---

Also, we should change the permissions of `sage-env` to non-executable (it must be *sourced*, not executed).

Instead, I think a much better solution is simply to make `sage-env` not executable.

John, Mercurial tracks file modes. The diffs it exports (and thus the patches mq exports) do not mention them unless you put "[diff]\ngit = true" in your .hgrc. My patch does this - you can just remove the hashbang line from it.

Generally putting "[diff]\ngit = true" in your .hgrc is a good idea, since it frees Mercurial from having to remain compatible with ancient pre-dvcs diff formats.

On sage.math.washington.edu, the directory `/scratch` is actually a link, pointing to `/mnt/usb1/scratch/`.  If you have a copy of Sage in a subdirectory of /scratch, then for reasons I don't understand, sometimes Sage thinks SAGE_ROOT is /scratch/... and sometimes it thinks it is /mnt/usb1/scratch/....  This doctest is failing because when the doctest runs, it thinks SAGE_ROOT is /mnt/usb1/scratch/..., while the output from \"which gap\" starts with /scratch/..., so the first entry in $PATH is the right directory, but with the wrong name.  Maybe when sage-env gets run twice, it manages to use /mnt/... both times.\n\nHere's a patch (to the Sage library) which applies os.path.realpath to both the value of SAGE_ROOT and the output from \"which gap\" (etc.).

Okay, I know what's going on.  This is a bug in a different aspect of Sage, but perhaps it can be fixed on this ticket.  On sage.math.washington.edu, the directory `/scratch` is actually a link, pointing to `/mnt/usb1/scratch/`.  If you have a copy of Sage in a subdirectory of /scratch, then for reasons I don't understand, sometimes Sage thinks SAGE_ROOT is /scratch/... and sometimes it thinks it is /mnt/usb1/scratch/....  This doctest is failing because when the doctest runs, it thinks SAGE_ROOT is /mnt/usb1/scratch/..., while the output from "which gap" starts with /scratch/..., so the first entry in $PATH is the right directory, but with the wrong name.  Maybe when sage-env gets run twice, it manages to use /mnt/... both times.

Here's a patch (to the Sage library) which applies os.path.realpath to both the value of SAGE_ROOT and the output from "which gap" (etc.).  This fixes the problem for me.

Some funny side effect, i.e. a bug that only gets really visible with #11021 (substituting almost all instances of `build` in `sage-spkg` with `$BUILD`, which by itself is pretty ok, but also replacing the odd `mymkdir()` with `mkdir -p`, the latter then finally showing the bug):

```
leif@portland:~/Sage/sage-4.7.1.alpha4$ ./sage -i flint-1.5.0.p5.spkg 
Installing flint-1.5.0.p5.spkg
Calling sage-spkg on flint-1.5.0.p5.spkg
Warning: Attempted to overwrite SAGE_ROOT environment variable
mkdir: cannot create directory `': No such file or directory
flint-1.5.0.p5
Machine:
Linux portland 2.6.28-19-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 16 18:00:58 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
sage: /home/leif/Sage/sage-4.7.1.alpha4/flint-1.5.0.p5.spkg is already installed
```

The error originates from `mkdir -p "$BUILD"`, previously `mymkdir "$BUILD"`, which incidentally didn't try to create the "empty" directory, because its test in advance `[ ! -d $1 ]` evaluates to `false` (although the directory of course does not exist).

The following `cd "$BUILD"` becomes a no-op, and most other instances of `$BUILD` happen to be `.../$BUILD`, so don't raise an error either. Only `rm` also fails when trying to remove the temporary files in the wrong directory (still `.../build/...`).

Note that previously, after merging this ticket (#10469), the error just didn't show up because during the build `sage-spkg` gets called directly, hence fully sourcing `sage-env` (such that `$BUILD` gets `build`), creating the `build` directory, which can later be used when otherwise its creation and therefore also references to it would fail.

Long story, for short:

If `sage-env` is (effectively) sourced only once, all variables must be exported, since the script first sourcing it can call other scripts that source `sage-env` again, but if `sage-env` then returns early, the second script doesn't get non-exported variables set.

(At least) `BUILD` is one such variable that currently doesn't get exported.

I'll provide a patch to `sage-env` at #11021.
