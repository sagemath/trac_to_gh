This patch adds (experimental) support for uploading a static html doc page as a worksheet in the notebook. As a side effect, it:

- allows for uploading a .txt file from a URL (was broken)
- allows for uploading a zip file containing .txt and .html files

This little feature would give a very simple workflow for distributing tutorial worksheets during our Sage(-Combinat) workshops, saving a lot of hassle and time to both us and the participants (more detail upon request). It would be great if this feature could be in the sage stable release by early May for the next Sage-Combinat workshop in
Acadia.

I wrote the attached small patch as a proof of concept; however this
is the first time I am touching the notebook code and I am not
planning to invest in this direction in the short term. So I would be extremely glad if some notebook expert could take over this patch, clean it up (look for TODO/FIXME), and rebase it upon #10521 with whom it probably conflicts lightly (this should be a breeze).

Little issues:

- The produced worksheet does not look as nice as a usual worksheet or the live documentation (in particular, there are some useless navigation links on top). That's probably a question of style file. Or maybe the navigation links should be stripped out.

Future extensions:

- Add support for attachements, non text outputs, etc (they are currently lost during the upload)

Related tickets:

- #4825: Uploading a pdf which contains an attached .sws will extract the .sws
- #7441: notebook: make it possible to upload from the url of a published worksheet
- #9875: Can't upload from a notebook link, only from a .sws file
- #10521: notebook upload of zipped worksheets can't deal with multiple worksheets with the same name

Hi Jason!

> I'm curious about how you plan on using this.  I'd love an easy way to distribute lots of tutorials.

So much for being lazy :-) Here it is!

We write our tutorials as rst files in the reference manual (exact location under discussion), and share them using our Sage-Combinat patch server ([1]). On any server, we compile the html documentation, and make it available to the participants ([2]).

Finaly, we point the participants to [3]. They can then click on any of the static tutorials; if they like it, they can just copy paste the url [4] from their brower into the "Upload" field of their notebook.

Note: in case the server runs a notebook server, or if one has the sage-combinat patches installed, then one can directly use the live documentation.

Cheers,
				Nicolas

This is great work. It should definitely be possible to upload anything sensible to the notebook and have it give you a worksheet.

Given the upcoming changes in the notebook, perhaps this ticket should be viewed as a feature request for the new Flask-based notebook.

This sounds natural indeed!

However, since the feature is needed very soon, and the change minor, I still would appreciate if this patch (or some improved version) was merged in soon in the current notebook.

Hi nthiery,

This would be a nice change.  See also [sws2tex](https://bitbucket.org/whuss/sws2tex/) and [tex2sws](https://bitbucket.org/rbeezer/tex2sws/) for related projects.

I am sorry that I can't review this and test it properly right now, though the code seems ok in the main.  What does the "assert False" do - I know what assert usually does, but I assume this is some special use of that statement?

Also, it would perhaps be better to us os.path or something like that 

```
sage: a = "http://www.me.com/mysheet.sws"
sage: os.path.splitext(a)
('http://www.me.com/mysheet', '.sws')
```
in twist.py and then just check the `result[1]` for the extensions that are allowed all at once, keeping that for glueing on later, also with os.path?

By the way, you could perhaps just use this on your combinat server - sometimes people put custom patches on servers, it's not hard to do if you're the admin.  That would keep it from being quite as critical to the rest of Sage.

Just a big fat advertisement that the execution flow is not supposed
to get there :-)

A proper assertion should be raised instead, but as the comment
states, I would need to have some feed back from the notebook people
to know which assertion would be most appropriate here.

Ok, I guess I'll just raise an RunTimeError for the moment.

Will do now.

The point is that we want to use this feature with the very first
tutorials. In particuliar with complete newbies. If using Sage starts
by having to apply a patch, we are going to scare them away :-) And
many of them won't have the required development tools to install the
Sage-Combinat queue, etc.

Thanks for your comments,

Cheers,
                    Nicolas

Hi!

Thanks for your further comments.

In the updated patch, the ``assert false`` is replaced by an
HTMLResponse; please check that the message is meaningful enough. The
extension guessins is now done with urlparse + splitext to get the
extension (though there are comments on the web that we should use the
Content-Type answer of the web server; but that was not very practical
here). The two lines after the ``return`` are removed; they were just
accidental residue of some former experimentation. Finally, I wrote
the missing doctest for _import_worksheet_html. I still have a problem
there, since the doctest does not pass (there is a single garbled
cell, instead of several), whereas running it by hand in the sage
interpreter just works fine. Help welcome!

Cheers,

This is what I got when I ran the doctest by hand:

```
sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')
sage: name = tmp_filename() + '.html'
sage: fd = open(name,'w')
sage: fd.write('\n'.join(
....: ['<html><head><title>Test Notebook</title></head>',
....: '<body>',
....: '<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>',
....: '<span class="gp">sage: </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>',
....: '<span class="go">2</span>',
....: '</pre></div></div>',
....: '</body></html>']))
sage: fd.close()
sage: W = nb._import_worksheet_html(name, 'admin')
sage: W.name()
u'Test Notebook'
sage: 
sage: W.owner()
'admin'
sage: W.cell_list()
[TextCell 1: Test Notebook
system:sage

<div class="highlight-python">, Cell 0; in=1+1, out=
2

sage: cell = W.cell_list()[1]

The problem is that the doctesting system replaces the "sage: " *inside* your html file with ">>>", which of course messes everything up.

I have a patch coming up.

nthiery: positive review on your patch, modulo the changes in my patch.  Can you review my patch?

Three substantial changes: 

1. I changed the doctest to use a bit more of the actual generated documentation file structure.

2. I changed the linebreaks in the doctest so that the string "sage: " did not appear as consecutive characters in input (this works around the bug in the doctesting system which replaces "sage:" with ">>>")

3. I deleted the line which prepended the title and system to the text of the worksheet.  Those don't do anything but show up as the first part of the first text cell, which is silly.  The default system is already 'sage', and the title is set when the worksheet is created.

Can you review my reviewer patch?  If you think it's good, set this ticket to positive review.
