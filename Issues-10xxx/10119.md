Plot should not allow this to go without an error:

```
Q = plot(df(Deltax=.01),(x,-pi,3*pi),color='red',linestyle='..'); Q
```
What the user likely meant (well, since it was me, definitely meant) was:

```
Q = plot(df(Deltax=.01),(x,-pi,3*pi),color='red',linestyle=':'); Q
```
But there is no error thrown.  Scrolling all the way down `plot?` each time is tedious.  

(We should probably also look at all plot options and make sure we get errors if we give bad input.  That would be a big project, esp. since mpl likely will change available input.)

Are you suggesting in the next comment that we should universally set the verbose level as helpful?  I'm not sure if that is what you mean.

I'm not sure if we should universally set the verbose level to 'helpful'.  It certainly seems to fill your need, but I don't know what else will be printing out things if we do that.  It definitely wouldn't help to try setting the verbose level to 'helpful' and seeing what happens.  After all, I suppose it is supposed to be "helpful"!
