MPIR builds libraries that have the "executable stack" flag. This breaks in Fedora 14 which tightened SELinux rules to disallow executable stack libraries by default. 

Note that the MPIR libraries do not need executable stack permissions, the flag is set erroneously. Probably because gcc can't figure it out automatically for assembler code.

Updated spkg is here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/mpir-1.2.2.p2.spkg

The only change was that the spkg-install tested whether the `execstack` utility is installed and then used it to clear the flag after the make step.

The new spkg now simply adds `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` to `LDFLAGS` on Linux.

I will check that. The main problem in mpir is there is some code in yasm
assembler and some in GNU assembler (and some more in C but these are not a problem) depending on the CPU.
In Gentoo we apply the following to the source of mpir-2.X.X:

```
	for i in $(find . -type f -name '*.asm') ; do
		# TODO: why does this not work without the following echo ???
		echo $i >/dev/null
		cat >> $i <<-EOF
			#if defined(__linux__) && defined(__ELF__)
			.section .note.GNU-stack,"",%progbits
			#endif
		EOF
	done

	for i in $(find . -type f -name '*.as') ; do
		echo $i >/dev/null
		cat >> $i <<-EOF
			%ifidn __OUTPUT_FORMAT__,elf
			section .note.GNU-stack noalloc noexec nowrite progbits
			%endif
		EOF
	done
```
We do this following the recommendation from [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/gnu-stack.xml](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/gnu-stack.xml)
The file naming is somewhat reverse from what we expected if I remember well.

Yes. Or pass `--noexecstack` to gcc. For the official mpir patch I would suggest to use the aforementioned `noexecstack.m4` which checks that the linker understands the `noexecstack` option.

I'm not sure if sticking it unconditionally into the spkg-install is the way to go. I think its supported since gcc-3.4, so that *probably* covers all gcc versions that can compile Sage. Not sure about Solaris...

Well, we at least currently need it on Linux only (Fedora 14), where we can assume a GNU linker.

By the way, the Fedora users could simply change / customize their policy, or disable SELinux... ;-)

It's IMHO cleaner (and more robust) to add

```sh
case "$UNAME" in
    Linux) # implies a GNU linker
        LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,z,noexecstack"
        # already exported by sage-env
        ;;
    # perhaps other platforms, too
esac
```

Note that the above doesn't depend on the GCC version (or the compiler in general; the flag to pass options to the linker might of course differ though, but that's probably handled by libtool).

Even the Sun linker might support that, though it is currently not an issue on [Open]Solaris.

Older versions of the GNU linker will silently ignore this option, i.e. its parameter (`noexecstack`); on such systems it is unlikely that requiring an executable stack will cause problems anyway.

Also, using the `execstack` tool requires having it installed on any build system one builds bdists on, if they are also targeted at e.g. Fedora 14, or other SELinux-enabled systems.

```
    type -P execstack &>/dev/null && ...
```
won't raise an error or give a warning in such cases.


Perhaps the MPIR developers will fix this upstream in a quick 2.1.4, such that it will be a non-issue soon, since we're going to upgrade MPIR anyway.

Nevertheless, feel free to send them a patch fixing their autotools/`configure`. ;-)

This had been necessary for at least earlier versions of Sage because of text relocations in the PARI library IIRC. Sage's `README.txt` contains a note on that:

```
SELINUX
--------

On Linux, if you get this error message:

    " restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied "

the problem is probably related to SELinux. See the following URL for
further information:

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A9):
> It's IMHO cleaner (and more robust) to add


```sh
case "$UNAME" in
    Linux) # implies a GNU linker
        LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,z,noexecstack"
        # already exported by sage-env
        ;;
    # perhaps other platforms, too
esac
```

You will have noticed the missing "`-`", should read:

```sh
        LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,-z,noexecstack"
```

Although both the commit message and the changelog entry lack a back-reference to this ticket, positive review.

I think we can safely (and should) merge this into 4.6.1, since unfortunately the MPIR upgrade (#8664) is again delayed by trouble with the necessary GMP-ECM upgrade (#5847) for a couple of reasons (mainly weird MacOS X PPC issues).
