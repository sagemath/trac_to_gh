I suggest the `ecmfactor` function takes as optional argument a sigma
value, which would be passed to GMP-ECM. In case of a successful
factorization, this would allow to know the lucky curve, for
example to report it on some tables of records.

For example I found a 61-digit prime factor using `ecmfactor`,
but was unable to know the lucky sigma
(http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/ecmnet.html).

Alternatively, one could store the (random) sigma value chosen by
GMP-ECM if not sigma was given, but that might be more difficult to
implement.

the attached file does two things:

(1) if an optional sigma=nnn input is given to ecmfactor, it uses that value (nnn) to choose the elliptic curve, instead of a random one. This allows to get a deterministic behaviour;

(2) if a non-trivial factor was found (with a random or user-given sigma) it is returned by
ecmfactor, which now returns (True, N, sigma)

you are right. However this was already the case before my patch. The best would be to open a
separate ticket to add documentation for this function.
