I made a post to `@`save-devel and was advised by a jmol developer to open a trac ticket, so, here it is.

Standard notebook output looks like http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/7279/notebookandtutorial.png but when run in the command line, the output looks like http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/3907/jmolwindow.png

The solution I used was to ignore EMBEDDED_MODE and use the same logic as when generating notebook data.

Note that the patch also does not use sage-native-execute and also pass "-s" to jmol, but these are issues with the mandriva rpm package, where it uses the system wide jmol installation, and workarounds an apparent issue with newer jmol that will not understand the argument is a script if not using the "-s" option.
