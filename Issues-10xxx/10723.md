Implement edge-by-edge options for latexing graphs with dot2tex


Here we color in red all edges touching the vertex ``0``::

```
   sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
   sage: G.set_latex_options(format="dot2tex", edge_options = lambda (u,v,label): { "color": "red" if u==0 else 1})
   sage: view(G)
```

By the way, this refactors the code of color_by_label to simplify its logic and generalize it for dot2tex output.

It also fixes a couple typos in the documentation, as well as
little shortcomings in the quotation functions in dot2tex_utils.

Thanks for your review.

Done.

Done.

Agreed. It now uses the default color.

Replaced by a call to latex as above in the same file.

>   line 534:  I really think `color_by_label`  should be  `edge_color_by_label`.  One might want to do exactly the same thing with the vertices in the future?  Or it should be unambiguous just what is being colored?


I agree, but this option already exists with that name in
plot/plot3d. So if we decide for this change then this should be done
everywhere at once. I vote for postponing that to #10851.

> Doctests:  4.6.2.alpha4, dot2tex-2.8.7-2, graphviz 2.26.3


> sage -t  devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py # 12 doctests failed

All test pass on my machine with the updated patch I'll upload soon.
If I did not screw up, this is both with and without dot2tex, as well
as with -long and -optional.

Cheers,

<a id='comment:12'></a>Oops, some long tests were still failing. Fixed and uploaded updated patch.

Part of the issue was due to the conflicting usage for edge_colors, where the specs said it was a dictionary, but it was used as a string in a couple places. I forked a separate option edge_color.

Some optional tests are failing due to a glitch in dot2tex which I have reported upstream (asking for a dot2tex layout with neato is currently broken). In any cases, that's orthogonal to this patch.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi Nicolas,

Sorry for the delay on this one.  I didn't realize it was holding up some other tickets.  Thanks for the changes.  I let the failure of graphviz to install throw me off and I forgot your warning on the optional test failures.  I'll pursue reporting the problem with the graphviz package.

This passes all non-optional tests, with or without, dot2tex installed, documentation builds fine, and works as advertised.  So positive review.

And yes, we should try to coordinate sometime on the different approaches to making these pretty pictures.
