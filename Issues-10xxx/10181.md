Maybe #9773 helps, I did not try.

I did notice the oddity, but OTOH I'm not yelling to have it fixed.

In response to a question by Paul Zimmerman on #9773, the implementation of finitely-generated abelian groups there could possibly speed up subgroup generation by something like 8x.  Current `subgroups()` routine calls `subgroups_reduced())`, I think once per subgroup, maybe more.  It would appear to be responsible for most of the computation time.  this does not exactly jibe with the observations of thome, but I have not spent the time to follow his explanation (though it wouldn't surprise me if it was similar, plausible or the same as what I'm presenting).

```
sage: G=AbelianGroup([2,4,8])
sage: len(G.subgroups())
81
sage: G.subgroup_reduced( [ [1,0,4], [1,2,4] ])
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C2, which is the subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to C2 x C4 x C8

5 loops, best of 3: 81.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit("G.subgroups()")
5 loops, best of 3: 7.52 s per loop
```

Draft patch at #9773 builds on finitely-generated modules, so the "reduction" to invariants is computed there, about 8x faster it would appear.  Patch does not have a `subgroups()` routine yet, but could be easy to add.  Maybe more efficiencies could be found.  Using code in #9773:

```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianFGGroup([2,4,8])
sage: H=G.subgroup([[1,0,4],[1,2,4]])
sage: H
Additive abelian group of order 4, isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_2 with generator(s): (0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 4)
sage: timeit("G.subgroup([[1,0,4],[1,2,4]])")
25 loops, best of 3: 10.2 ms per loop
```
