I must say: there is a lot of code where I don't really understand what you do, and why you do it. E.g., which code is generic enough to put in categories and which is not, how are examples organized, how do you properly test the code, ...

In my (not yet final) review patch, I place some questions on implementations, some suggestions for additional methods, and I fixed several typos.

Best, Christian

Hmm, more specific questions (like the one below) would be useful to
get a constructive discussion :-)

> E.g., which code is generic enough to put in categories and which is
> not,


The rule of thumb is: does the code use the data structure or not?
For example, a method like has_top uses the internal hasse diagram,
and therefore remains in Poset. On the other hand a method like
join_irreducibles just requires that there is a method "lower_covers",
and so can be implemented generically in the category.

But that's just a rule thumb; I left in Poset all the code that was on
the edge, so as to avoid moving too much code around.

> how are examples organized, how do you properly test the code, ...


Are those questions about the category framework in general, or about
this specific patch?

Ok, thanks!

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hi Nicolas, thanks for ccing me!

Given that the problem is not reproducible in the command line, I am not exactly sure how to attack it, but we probably need to focus on the failing doctest in `fan.py`.

The problem as shown by the doctest framework is that cones which are supposed to know that they sit inside a fan appear to be "standalone" and breaking this relation messes up everything that builds up on top of it.

I'll try to trace it down further, but it may take me a few days due to traveling and conferencing...

For the record: finite posets and their elements, now have UniqueRepresentation. This could have an influence if the same poset is created several times when constructing several fans.

I really don't want to make fans unique at this point as I am planning some adjustments to them and related objects.

    "body": "<a id='comment:34'></a>Hi Nicolas!\n\nWith the patch:\n\n```\nsage: F1 = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.octahedron(3))\nsage: F2 = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.octahedron(3))\nsage: F1 == F2\nTrue\nsage: F1 is F2\nFalse\nsage: F1(2)[0]\n2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N\nsage: F1(2)[0].ambient() is F1\nTrue\nsage: F2(2)[0].ambient() is F2\nFalse\n```\n\nThe last command is heavily assumed to return True in the toric-related code. The problem is that when the cone lattice of `F2` is constructed, it is considered as the same poset as the cone lattice of `F1` and so all cones of `F2` become linked to `F1`. Possible solutions are:\n* Make cone lattices of fans which are \"==\" but not \"is\" distinct. This should fix the issue without any complications as it will basically restore the current state.\n* Make \"==\" and \"is\" comparisons the same for fans. I think that this is undesirable as there are arguments for making \"==\" be the mathematical equivalence, which is even weaker than the current behaviour.\n* Make fans unique based on the ordered list of rays and cone generators.

<a id='comment:34'></a>Hi Nicolas!

With the patch:

```
sage: F1 = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.octahedron(3))
sage: F2 = FaceFan(lattice_polytope.octahedron(3))
sage: F1 == F2
True
sage: F1 is F2
False
sage: F1(2)[0]
2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
sage: F1(2)[0].ambient() is F1
True
sage: F2(2)[0].ambient() is F2
False
```

The last command is heavily assumed to return True in the toric-related code. The problem is that when the cone lattice of `F2` is constructed, it is considered as the same poset as the cone lattice of `F1` and so all cones of `F2` become linked to `F1`. Possible solutions are:
* Make cone lattices of fans which are "==" but not "is" distinct. This should fix the issue without any complications as it will basically restore the current state.
* Make "==" and "is" comparisons the same for fans. I think that this is undesirable as there are arguments for making "==" be the mathematical equivalence, which is even weaker than the current behaviour.
* Make fans unique based on the ordered list of rays and cone generators. This should fix the issue but may have consequences. Also, while in general unique fans may be good, it would be nice to still have a possibility to make "==" the mathematical equivalence and IMHO it would be absolutely terrible for performance and convenience of use if uniqueness of fans was based on their mathematical equivalence. 

Note: I'd rather not make cones unique based on the ordered list of rays as I want to have a possibility to create different cones with the same order of rays but different order of facet normals. This is not currently implemented but would be extremely convenient for handling all kinds of dualities and correspondences.

So, in short, I prefer to be able to create different posets of cones for fans which are "==".

Thank you,
Andrey

Thanks a lot! I'll look at this tonight.

I am still confused a bit: do you know where technically in the cone code is there an ``==`` or ``is`` test done on some posets, which cause the change of behaviour above?

When a fan computes its cone lattice, it constructs all of the required cones (which are bound to the correct fan) and then converts them into a poset. All further methods work with this poset.

The precise method of fans is `_compute_cone_lattice`.

Now, I have actually realized, that it will have the same issue for cones, it just does not break the existent doctests yet:

```
sage: C1 = Cone([(0,1)])
sage: C2 = Cone([(0,1)])
sage: C1 == C2
True
sage: C1 is C2
False
sage: C1.facets()[0]
0-d face of 1-d cone in 2-d lattice N
sage: C1.facets()[0].ambient() is C1
True
sage: C2.facets()[0].ambient() is C1
True
sage: C2.facets()[0].ambient() is C2
False
```
The code for cones is in `face_lattice` method. Again, I don't want to get the same posets even for cones that have the same order of rays, and there are arguments that "==" should treat rays as sets. So it would be nice to force different posets for "==" objects.

Why exactly are posets unique? Isn't it expensive to check that two posets are equivalent? I am interested in dealing with face lattices of about 10<sup>5</sup> elements, how long would it take to check their equality? Maybe elements of posets should be unique, but not posets themselves?

As far as I understood, there is not check for equivalence, is it ? Actually,
I'm not sure what you mean by equivalence opposed to equality. However I see
no reason why two posets with the same element and the same ordering should be
different object: mathematically they are the same set with the same
ordering...

More pragmatically, I have some code using poset as key for hash tables. At
first I didn't ensure that posets were unique then the code end-up spending
all the time comparing poset that is comparing the underlying graph.

In my opinion, if you need to see two equal poset as different, this is
because you have some more information on those poset (eg: some tag saying
where it come from). If it is the case, I have the feeling that you should
inherit a class from poset which adds the tag and use it for comparison and
creation so that two differently tagged posets will be different for is as for
==.

My two cents,

Florent

Correct.

To me this sounds like two cones/fans shall be equal (as in A==B) only if they really have the same ambient space / ... and otherwise be only isomorphic (as in A.is_isomorphic(B)). 
In general, equality is often used by Python at a very low level, e.g. for hash table lookups. So it should be fast and simple.

Anyway, this does not need to be settled now, and we can discuss this more efficiently face to face at the next occasion.

> I agree that we have here more structure than poset itself but it is basically the question of "the same" and "isomorphic".

We definitely have had such use cases as well. However we were lucky enough that we usually wanted to add some more structure, or change a bit the structure, and in those cases we would either derive a new class, or use a facade parent together with Cat.IsomorphicObjects() to transfer the part of the structure that was to be kept.

But we could think of generalizing the use of a key=`...` in UniqueRepresentation as I used here for posets.

Ok. I'll keep this in mind, and wait until we get enough other use cases.

Thanks Andrey for your fast review.

As an example, I tried

```
sage: D = Poset({ 0:[1,2], 1:[3], 2:[3,4] })
sage: D.plot(label_elements=False)

sage: D.show()
sage: elm_labs = {0:'a', 1:'b', 2:'c', 3:'d', 4:'e'}
sage: D.show(element_labels=elm_labs)

In both cases, I see the numbers as labels.
