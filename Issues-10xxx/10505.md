CPLEX is a funny guy who does not understand that 1.546846847 e-17 is not a proper value for a binary variable.

The returned value is not of integer type (2.0 instead of 2). Should we cast it to Integer, or int, or leave it like that ?

Oops... You are right !

The thing is that casting it to Integer would mean having to create a new object for each returned variable, even when using the code from the C level. And casting it to a Python int would mean that you can not divide is safely anymore (1/2 becomes 0).

What do you think of letting it stay like that ? The goal was really to be able to test (variable == 0) without fearing that variable (declared as binary in the LP) would have 0.0000001 as a value.

We can still *really* cast the values to integer in situations where the user expect it, like in #11367 which just got reviewed.

While I was at it, though, I noticed a mistake in the documentation generated from the mip.pyx file : the first line contained a math equation which was not properly written.. I just updated the patch to fix it ! `:-)`

Concerning the documentation, I don't see any improvement. In fact, most of the math equations are not properly displayed in the page. I see only the latex code (e.g., w_i \in \mathbb{Z}).

Patch updated. I added a note in the documentation of ``MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values``.
