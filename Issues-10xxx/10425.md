Patch will allow optional recording of a new matrix subdivision when augmenting two matrices.

What should happen with row subdivisions?  The solution here is to preserve them (if a subdivided matrix as a result is requested) if and only if the two matrices have equal row subdivisions.

After this is reviewed, I'll implement similar behavior for the `stack()` command.

Patch moved to #10424.
