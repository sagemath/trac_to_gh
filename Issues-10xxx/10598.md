Assignee: nborie

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: days28, empty set, EmptySetError

As Florent Hivert gave extremely useful features about empty things, we should use it. The Following should returns an EmptySetError

```
sage: S = Set([])
sage: S.an_element()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)

...


StopIteration: 
sage: 
```

Also, make the EmptySetError being documented already in the structure of Parent. Improve the documentation of an_element and _an_element_ in Parent.

Technically, some_elements should return an iterable, not an iterator, so you can iterate over it more than once. The except clause should be changed to return [], not return iter([]), though with the empty case the behavior is the same.

Good point. I will ask today Nicolas what does he think about that... I don't really know the specifications for the Test Suite and how deal exactly with such corner case.
Florent did this with FiniteEnumeratedSet (The user know a priori that the set is finite...)

```
sage: FiniteEnumeratedSet([])
{}
sage: FiniteEnumeratedSet([]).some_elements()
<generator object _some_elements_from_iterator at 0xb433464>
```
I will give an answer shortly for that.
