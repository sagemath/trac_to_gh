When `log_gamma` is naively numerically evaluated, it seems to be wrong.

```
sage: log_gamma(i).n()
-0.0219785471672303 - 0.168184318273662*I
```
Pari gives this:

```
sage: log_gamma(pari(i))
-0.650923199301856 - 1.87243664726243*I
```
And in Sage's Maxima:

```
(%i3) ev(log_gamma(%i),numer);
(%o3)             - 1.872436647262428 %i - .6509231993018556
```
And in ginsh for Ginac 1.5.8:

```
> lgamma(I);
-0.65092319930185634056+4.41074865991715666*I
```
which is pretty clearly a different branch choice from Maxima and Pari (the complex part is exactly `2*pi` away from Maxima and Pari).

The relevant bit of code is

```
sage: a = log_gamma(i)
sage: a._convert(RealField(53).complex_field())
-0.0219785471672303 - 0.168184318273662*I
```
But I'm not sure if this problem is in Pynac or in the Sage complex field.

Okay, fair enough - so change that to whatever `RealField.complex_field()` becomes, which I don't know.  Feel free to alter the description to wherever RealField goes under that - ComplexField, I guess.

Correct.  My comment about the `2*pi` was in reference to the Ginac output, not the Sage output.  But I can't for the life of me figure out how Sage is actually doing `log_gamma(i).n()`, because the conversion to the complex field pretty clearly just converts it to a Ginac object and then numerically evaluates. 

As to the precision, I think there must be something missing in our code, because the Ginac docs state

```
The function evalf that was used above converts any number in GiNaC's expressions into floating point numbers. This can be done to arbitrary predefined accuracy:

     > evalf(1/7);
     0.14285714285714285714
     > Digits=150;
     150
     > evalf(1/7);
     0.1428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428571428
     5714285714285714285714285714285714285
```
So maybe we're not taking that into account, though I have no idea how I would do so.

I found the reason of the bug. In `symbolic/pynac.pyx`, function `py_lgamma`, it is
written `CC(x).log().gamma()` instead of `CC(x).gamma().log()`:

```
sage: CC(I).log().gamma()
-0.0219785471672303 - 0.168184318273662*I
sage: CC(I).gamma().log()
-0.650923199301856 - 1.87243664726243*I
```
If somebody provides a patch, I will review it.
