This (large) patch creates a `backends` directory in the `numerical/` folder.

It adds the following files :

* glpk_backend.pyx/pxd
* coin_backend.pyx/pxd
* cplex_backend.pyx/pxd
* generic_backend.pyx/pxd

It removes the following files from `numerical`

* mip_glpk.pyx/pxd
* mip_coin.pyx/pxd
* mip_cplex.pyx/pxd
* osi_interface.pyx/pxd

What for ? There is no a real interface between Sage and all these solvers. Not just a "solve"function that does everything at the same time. It is now much clearer, much more efficient, and it will be faaaaaaaar easier to use solver-specific features. It can now be used directly in Cython, and we can now deal with constraint generation (see patches XXX and XXX), which is a great news.

I know this patch is huge, and I swear I tried to avoid it by considering step-by-step patches, which slowly became a nightmare... The good point in all this is that all the LP-related methods are extensively tested through all the graph methods, which are very likely to detect the important mistakes. I do not doubt there are many left, and I expect this patch to be followed by several "fixes" as these new features are being used, but.... I hope this review will get us rid of most of them !

Thankssssssssss !!!

(With this patch, there is no need anymore to install CBC in order to use CPLEX. Just adding the cplex files to include/ and lib/, as indicated at the end of http://www.sagemath.org/doc/constructions/linear_programming.html#solvers and running ``sage -b`` is enough)

Got it. I will document the expected INPUT/OUTPUT, but do you really think doctests are necessary at this level ? As you say, it will be indirect as these methods are all cdef (sage -coverage answers 100% on these files because of that), so as there is a wealth of methods testing them all in the graph/ and numerical/ directory...

Indeed. As long as you ask it knowing it means a lot of time, I do not mind doing it (as soon as I will have your advise onthe previous question)

Hi, a few comments. They are rather nitpicky but since you're defining an interface it would be hard to change any of this at a later time.

* there is one doctest failure, where you forgot to catch the `NotImplementedError`
* `getSolver` should be `get_solver` according to Python coding conventions
* Sage matrices use `ncols()` instead of `n_cols()`, I suggest to do the same for consistency (same for (`nrows`, `add_column` instead of `add_col`)
* Isn't `set_sense()` the canonical vocabulary instead of `set_direction()`?
* I think we have a bias in Sage to using `coefficient` instead of `coeff` in function names
* One could rename `set_log_level` to `set_verbose(_level)()` to match the global function names already defined in Sage (see below for comments on getters and setters)
* I wonder if it would make sense to rename `add_constraint` to `add_linear_constraint`. Of course, this is a linear programming backend but many of the solvers we support also support non-linear constraints.
* Sage matrices define `row()` instead of `get_row()`. I guess if you change the name then maybe all `get_XXX()` might be replaced by `XXX()` which seems to conform to Python conventions.
* In the same spirit one could replace `get/set_variable_min/max` by functions `variable_min/max` which return the value if no optional argument is given and set the value if it is given.

I've attached a referee patch which fixes the following issues:
* Nathan didn't claim copyright but he should, I've also added him as AUTHOR in the docstring
* `get_objective_coeff` -> `get_objective_coefficient`, it seems to be an oversight that it wasn't renamed
* removed the optional modules Coin and CPLEX from the reference manual (the produce errors since they cannot be found if they are not installed)

I guess it would be nice to have pickling for these backends but it is unrealistic that it can be implemented for all (or even most) of them. Thus, I'd say if my referee patch is accepted by Nathann, this is good to go.

You're right about this cplex/cbc thing. But maybe we will also have to deal with optional doc, as we already deal with libraries conditionally built according to the spkg installed.

About the copyright, I have a *technical* question : why do you think I should ?.. I often see people adding their names in methods they add, or at the head of files, and I really do not mind as they wrote them themselves... But I tried to "forget it" when I could, not willing to play a patent game I do not like.... Philosophically, I prefer to contribute without really leaving my name, but why do you think these files should be copyrighted ? Isn't it some "sage copyright" by default ?

We license this software via GPLv2+ to everybody. To license something, it needs to have a copyright (reversed, you cannot license something that has no assigned creator).

uhm, i meant, internationally. in the usa exists public domain, but not in other countries and afaik there is no way to apply this us copyright law automatically outside the usa ;) There is also a difference if you want to make something public domain right now or if you want to wait ~80 years.

... and on top of that, things are even more complicated because law changes all the time.
