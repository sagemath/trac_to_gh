I'm using Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 with Pynac 0.2.1.

get_systems raises an error when called on a user created variable (but not on 'x'):

```
sage: get_systems('x+x')
[]
sage: get_systems('x*x')
[]
sage: a = var('a')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'
```
Similarly, get_systems('2**a') and get_systems('a**2') gives an error with None_Type

Moreover I get a segfault when calling get_systems on a power with symbolic expressions as base and exponent.

```
sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('x**x')
[]
sage: a = var('a')
sage: get_systems('a**x')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

```
and :

```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: get_systems('x**a')

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

73              ptr(const ptr & other) throw() : p(other.p) { p->add_reference(); }

```
I'll have a deeper look at it later, but I have no idea of how get_systems work yet.

I finally figured out *why* it works.  For my own reference, or others who might have been similarly confused by this important but arcane subject.  In some sense we're lucky that JP happened upon 'a', as many others weren't in this!

```
sage: get_systems('print locals()')
{'a': None, 'bad_res': None, 'systems_used': None, 'stats': None, 'bad_re': None, 'i': None, 'cmd': 'print locals()', 'system': None, 'filename': '/Users/karl-dietercrisman/.sage//temp/new_host_2.home/60265//tmp_2', 're': <module 're' from '/Applications/MathApps/sage/local/lib/python/re.pyc'>, 's': None, 'r': None, 'cProfile': <module 'cProfile' from '/Applications/MathApps/sage/local/lib/python/cProfile.pyc'>, 'pstats': <module 'pstats' from '/Applications/MathApps/sage/local/lib/python/pstats.pyc'>, 'strings': None}
[]
```
Yes, we wouldn't want to use these particular locals to `exec` the command.

And work the patch does, in a fair number of cases (using quite a few of the systems) I still tested.   Good catch.
