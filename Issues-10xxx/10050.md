<a id='comment:1'></a>note that there are issues with the current polylog function:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
```
The first command should not evaluate symbolically, since the input 1.0 is a floating-point.
The second command should evaluate numerically, like for example `bessel_J(2,0.9)`.

Should I open a separate ticket?

Paul

Proposed to be invalid. If you agree I would reword this ticket to fix the mentioned bugs only.

Better late than never. This is now #18386.
