Numeric evaluation methods for the Nielsen Generalized Polylogarithm are commented out in the pynac source since it tries to call the `CLN` library directly. The calls to CLN should be replaced with their MPFR, etc. equivalents and the function made available symbolically in Sage. The Pynac part is https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/3

<a id='comment:1'></a>note that there are issues with the current polylog function:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
```
The first command should not evaluate symbolically, since the input 1.0 is a floating-point.
The second command should evaluate numerically, like for example `bessel_J(2,0.9)`.

Should I open a separate ticket?

Paul

I was thinking of the other polylog like functions from [ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/src/tip/ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp) when I created this ticket.
