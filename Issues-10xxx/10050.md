note that there are issues with the current polylog function:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
```
The first command should not evaluate symbolically, since the input 1.0 is a floating-point.
The second command should evaluate numerically, like for example `bessel_J(2,0.9)`.

Should I open a separate ticket?

Paul

I was thinking of the other polylog like functions from [ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/src/tip/ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp) when I created this ticket.

At the moment Pynac calls `symbolic/pynac.pyx:py_li()` which calls `mpmath`. It is not clear to me why the outcommented pynac code would be needed, to remove the call overhead? If you replace the CLN dependency, with what MPFR?, how would this be better or faster than mpmath?

Proposed to be invalid. If you agree I would reword this ticket to fix the mentioned bugs only.
