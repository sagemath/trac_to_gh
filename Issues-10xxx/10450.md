At [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/265/specific-cmap), there is some good discussion of making custom colormaps.    'DSM' gives the idea of the following, which 'Hypercube' suggests we make a standard method:

```
# preamble
import matplotlib

# choose our preferred colour scheme, where None describes the exceptions
cdict = {0: 'red', 1: 'green', 2:'yellow', 3:'orange', 43+2*I: 'brown', None: 'purple'}

# choose some fixed order -- doesn't matter what -- for iterating the keys
ckeys, cvals = zip(*cdict.items())

# build a mapping function to turn the matrix elements into integers
# (would be faster to use a dict for lots of colours)
cmap_fn = lambda x: Integer(ckeys.index(x if x in cdict else None))

# generate a colormap with exactly the colours we want, in the right order
my_cmap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(cvals)

# generate a test matrix
m = Matrix(lambda i,j: (i+j) if (i,j) != (6,6) else 43+2*I, nrows=10)

# plot it: apply the mapping function to the matrix and feed matrix_plot our colour map
matrix_plot(m.apply_map(cmap_fn), cmap=my_cmap)
```

Also, apparently `matrix_plot?` isn't as helpful as it should be.   In the same question, it wasn't obvious how to make a listed colormap - this is buried in the `MatrixPlot` documentation.
