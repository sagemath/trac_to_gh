Hi Kini,

Thanks for this - looks like Dima beat me to a review.

Have you seen  `hg qpush --move some_patch.patch`  in the newest versions of Mercurial?   Let's you grab an unapplied patch out of any position in the unapplied stack to push on.

Rob

Hi Keshav,

Just upgraded my OS, so now have a version of Mercurial with "--move" - been anxiously awaiting it.  It will make the Developers Guide better, no need to talk about editing the series file.  Just passing it along, in case you hadn't seen it.  ;-)

No - wasn't suggesting that for this ticket, or a new incremental ticket.  I'll try to round up a few details like this for the reorganization proposed in sage-devel.  Post there if you have any more tips or tricks!

Thanks,
Rob
