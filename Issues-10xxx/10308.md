The following problem was discovered by Victor Miller in Sage-support

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/e30af8c695b6a912

```python
sage: T.<t1,t2,u1,u2> = QQ[] 
sage: TJ = Ideal([t1^2 + u1^2 - 1,t2^2 + u2^2 - 1, (t1-t2)^2 + (u1-u2)^2 -1]) 
sage: TJ.genus() 
4294967295 
sage: TJ.dimension() 
1 
```

I can confirm the bug in debian 64bits. Howeber, in debian 32 bits the answer is

```
sage: TJ.genus()
-1
```

So it seems to be a problem with 2**32-1 in 32 vs 64 bits.

A simpler example (Ubuntu 64-bit):

```python
sage: R.<x, y, z> = QQ[]
sage: C = Curve(x^2 - 2*y^2)
sage: C.is_singular()
True
sage: C.genus()
4294967295
```

Attachment: **[10380.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10308/10380.patch.gz)**

It seems to me that the bug is solved in linux 64 bits with newer versions of Sage.

I attach a doctest for the record.

The bug does not appear to be present in 5.11.beta3, the patch applies and the tests that it introduces run correctly.  Note that the answer `-1` is really the (geometric) genus, not an error code (as one could be led to suspect by the sage-support discussion cited above).
