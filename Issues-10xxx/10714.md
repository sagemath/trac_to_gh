Row vectors from a sparse matrix are incorrect when the matrix has zero rows.

```
sage: D = matrix(0, 2, sparse=False)
sage: D.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: D.nrows()
0
sage: D.rows()
[]
sage: S = matrix(0, 2, sparse=True)
sage: S.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 2 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
sage: S.nrows()
0
sage: S.rows()
[(0, 0)]
```

`sage/matrix/matrix1.Matrix.sparse_rows()` is the place to look.

Apply  trac_10714-rows-sparse-matrices.patch, trac_10714-columns-sparse-matrices.patch

It seems to me like they are sparse vectors.  

```
sage: S = matrix(0, 2, sparse=True)
sage: v = S.rows()[0]
sage: type(v)
<type 'sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse'>
sage: v.is_sparse()

The problem seems to be the `append()` at the outer level in the "finish up" stanza.

Patch just short-circuits when there are no rows and returns an empty list before anything happens to it.  Passes all tests on 4.6.2.alpha2.

Correct.  Returned vectors have their entries specified by dictionaries when created, so they default to sparse.
