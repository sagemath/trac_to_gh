Although I'm not a mathematician, I believe from reading the help page and looking at the examples, the Sage command `cremona_letter_code` should probably only work for non-negative integers. However, this is not the case. 

```

sage: cremona_letter_code(23.23) # Invalid input, gives output.
'x'
sage: cremona_letter_code(-3)   # Invalid input, hangs using lots of CPU time.
```

Any attempt to send erroneous input to a command should generate an error message. 

There seems to be three problems with this. 
* Negative integers hang Sage, using lots of CPU time. 
* The documentation says "integers" but I think it should say "non-negative integers" - at least all the examples are either 0 or positive integers. 
* Floating point numbers produce output, despite the fact the documentation says the argument should be an integer. 

This was found by using Fuzz Testing 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing
where one purposely supplies invalid input, to check how software behaves. 


http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-fuzztest.html

says *Fuzz testing is a simple technique that can have a profound effect on your code quality.*

I've marked it as a minor priority, as clearly its not a huge bug. But it would be worth fixing it.

<a id='comment:2'></a>You are quite right: any input not a non-negative integer is bad, and the code should check this.

It's also true that this function need not be in the global namespace, it's a technical helper function. so in sage/databases/all.py:

```
from cremona import CremonaDatabase, \
     cremona_letter_code, parse_cremona_label, \
     old_cremona_letter_code, is_optimal_id
```
only the first import should be there.  For another ticket perhaps, since certainly removing those global imports will result in lots of local ones being needed.

I thought I probably was, though since I'm not a mathematician, I don't understand much of this. 

I just wrote a little script which stuck some data into every function and looked to see for any that crashed or hung - I've no idea if the output of the others is correct or not.

Yes, those other changes do sound like they need to be on another ticket. I'll leave you to create that one. 

I would have thought this one pretty easy to fix, though I'm not going to attempt it myself as I'm not a competent Python programmer. You are the best person to do it.

That was an abbreviated message rather than a mistake, but I have corrected it now.  
(Replacement patch in a few seconds.)
And I too am still building alpha3 so this was made for alpha2, though I think it highly unlikely that will change matters.

By the way, the only places where this function is used outside its own file are in modular/abvar/abvar and .../abvar_newform, where it is explicitly imported.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Thanks John. I think its third time lucky, as I can't find any faults with this. 

I've tried every combination of junk I can think of to throw at `cremona_letter_code()`, but it always behaves properly. It will not accept any augments except one non-negative integer. 

It passes the doctest

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha3$ ./sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/databases/cremona.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/databases/cremona.py"

All tests passed!

However, I don't feel my Python skills are sufficient to press the positive review, so I hope someone with more Python knowledge will look at this. But I can't fault it myself.
