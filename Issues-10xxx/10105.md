Although I'm not a mathematician, I believe from reading the help page and looking at the examples, the Sage command `cremona_letter_code` should probably only work for non-negative integers. However, this is not the case. 

```

sage: cremona_letter_code(23.23) # Invalid input, gives output.
'x'
sage: cremona_letter_code(-3)   # Invalid input, hangs using lots of CPU time.
```

Any attempt to send erroneous input to a command should generate an error message. 

There seems to be three problems with this. 
* Negative integers hang Sage, using lots of CPU time. 
* The documentation says "integers" but I think it should say "non-negative integers" - at least all the examples are either 0 or positive integers. 
* Floating point numbers produce output, despite the fact the documentation says the argument should be an integer. 

This was found by using Fuzz Testing 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing
where one purposely supplies invalid input, to check how software behaves. 


http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-fuzztest.html

says *Fuzz testing is a simple technique that can have a profound effect on your code quality.*

I've marked it as a minor priority, as clearly its not a huge bug. But it would be worth fixing it.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

You are quite right: any input not a non-negative integer is bad, and the code should check this.

It's also true that this function need not be in the global namespace, it's a technical helper function. so in sage/databases/all.py:

```
from cremona import CremonaDatabase, \
     cremona_letter_code, parse_cremona_label, \
     old_cremona_letter_code, is_optimal_id
```
only the first import should be there.  For another ticket perhaps, since certainly removing those global imports will result in lots of local ones being needed.

I thought I probably was, though since I'm not a mathematician, I don't understand much of this. 

I just wrote a little script which stuck some data into every function and looked to see for any that crashed or hung - I've no idea if the output of the others is correct or not.

I would have thought this one pretty easy to fix, though I'm not going to attempt it myself as I'm not a competent Python programmer. You are the best person to do it.

That was an abbreviated message rather than a mistake, but I have corrected it now.  
(Replacement patch in a few seconds.)
And I too am still building alpha3 so this was made for alpha2, though I think it highly unlikely that will change matters.

By the way, the only places where this function is used outside its own file are in modular/abvar/abvar and .../abvar_newform, where it is explicitly imported.

Thanks John. I think its third time lucky, as I can't find any faults with this. 

I've tried every combination of junk I can think of to throw at `cremona_letter_code()`, but it always behaves properly. It will not accept any augments except one non-negative integer. 

It passes the doctest

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha3$ ./sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/databases/cremona.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/databases/cremona.py"        
	 [3.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 3.9 seconds
```

However, I don't feel my Python skills are sufficient to press the positive review, so I hope someone with more Python knowledge will look at this. But I can't fault it myself.
