The top level `inverse_mod` method for ring elements (in `sage.structure.element.RingElement`) mandates that `inverse_mod` should always take an ideal of the ring as its argument. The integer ring doesn't implement this correctly:

```
sage: ZZ(2).inverse_mod(ZZ.ideal(3))

I don't mean to seem hostile, but: I wrote the generic Smith and Hermite form code, and I used no assumptions on the methods of the ring elements other than those mandated by the docstrings of the top-level `sage.structure.element.RingElement` class. The problem is that the Integer class doesn't play by the rules (because it's so routine to confuse an ideal of ZZ with its non-negative generator).

So the solution is not to change the Smith form code, but to add a couple of lines to `Integer.inverse_mod` to make it consistent with the general ring element template.

Hi David,

Thanks for the explanation, and the patch (and the review on #10626).  I spent several hours tracking down a number field doctest-failure to this "problem" with a sparse matrix being shipped to the generic routine.  At that point, I was just puzzled by the failure of the generic code to behave properly on a simple example and did not dig any deeper.  In retrospect, a post to sage-devel might have been a better course, but I knew you would know what was up.  So thanks again for the explanation and the fix.

I'll work up a review of this later today.

Rob

Passes all tests on 4.6.1.alpha3, rectifies problem at #10626, and looks good.  Positive review.
