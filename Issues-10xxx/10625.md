I don't mean to seem hostile, but: I wrote the generic Smith and Hermite form code, and I used no assumptions on the methods of the ring elements other than those mandated by the docstrings of the top-level `sage.structure.element.RingElement` class. The problem is that the Integer class doesn't play by the rules (because it's so routine to confuse an ideal of ZZ with its non-negative generator).

So the solution is not to change the Smith form code, but to add a couple of lines to `Integer.inverse_mod` to make it consistent with the general ring element template.

Hi David,

I'll work up a review of this later today.
