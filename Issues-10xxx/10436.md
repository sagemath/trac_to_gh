On a clean installation of Sage including #10303, I get

```
$ ./sage -ba-force
*** TOUCHING ALL CYTHON (.pyx) FILES ***
KeyError: 'SAGE64':

Apart from this error message, `sage -ba-force` seems to work.

This was a 32-bit build on OpenSolaris 06/2009. 

What system was the problem noticed? Was SAGE64 set?

This was on `sage.math.washington.edu`, a Ubuntu Linux x86_64 system.  I did not set `SAGE64`.
