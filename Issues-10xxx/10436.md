On a clean installation of Sage including #10303, I get

```
$ ./sage -ba-force
*** TOUCHING ALL CYTHON (.pyx) FILES ***
KeyError: 'SAGE64':
  File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-4.6.1.rc0/devel/sage-main/c_lib/SConstruct", line 108:

Apart from this error message, `sage -ba-force` seems to work.

I do **not** see this problem on a build where SAGE64 was not set. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.1.alpha3$ ./sage -ba-force
*** TOUCHING ALL CYTHON (.pyx) FILES ***
scons: `install' is up to date.

----------------------------------------------------------
sage: Building and installing modified Sage library files.


Installing c_lib
```

This was a 32-bit build on OpenSolaris 06/2009. 

What system was the problem noticed? Was SAGE64 set?

This was on `sage.math.washington.edu`, a Ubuntu Linux x86_64 system.  I did not set `SAGE64`.
