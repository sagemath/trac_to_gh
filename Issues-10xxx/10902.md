There are currently no known counter examples where Singular would return an incorrect factorisation. It might be very very slow but does not return wrong answers as far as we know. Hence, we should drop `proof=False`.

Dear Martin,

Replying to [@malb](#comment%3A1):
> I reported this upstream: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/320

this ticket is empty on my browser (firefox). Also, is there a workaround to factor bivariate
polynomials over a prime field from within Sage, in particular over GF(2)?

Paul, the Singular developers replied on that ticket and state that this bug is fixed in Singular 3-1-2. Updating to 3-1-2 is now #10903.

As for a workaround, I cannot immediately think of any. It's a pretty grim situation, but at least now there is a Singular developer working on factoring.

thanks Martin. Once Singular is updated to 3-1-2, I will try to find examples where the factorization returned by Singular is incomplete. It would help to have concrete examples
in the documentation.

Is this really so bad?

```
def check(f0, f1):
    CP = CartesianProduct(*[f0.base_ring()]*len(f0.variables()))
    for xvec in CP:
        f0_val = f0.subs(dict((v, xv) for v, xv in zip(f0.variables(), xvec)))
        f1_val = f1.subs(dict((v, xv) for v, xv in zip(f0.variables(), xvec)))
        print xvec, f0_val, f1_val, f0_val == f1_val

sage: f0 = x^5 * y^8 * (x*y^4 + y^3 + 1)
sage: f1 = x^5 * y^6 * (x*y^4 + y^3 + 1)
sage: check(f0, f1)
[0, 0] 0 0 True
[0, 1] 0 0 True
[1, 0] 0 0 True
[1, 1] 1 1 True
```

The factor of `y^2` has no effect, so aren't the two polynomials equivalent in GF(2)?  This happens pretty frequently:

```
sage: f0 = x**8+y**8+1
sage: f1 = f0.factor(proof=False)
sage: f1
(x + y + 1)^6
sage: f1.expand()
x^6 + x^4*y^2 + x^2*y^4 + y^6 + x^4 + y^4 + x^2 + y^2 + 1
sage: check(f0, f1.expand())
[0, 0] 1 1 True
[0, 1] 0 0 True
[1, 0] 0 0 True
[1, 1] 1 1 True
```

Is there a case where the two expressions aren't equivalent as functions?  Or am I missing something obvious like usual?

Martin, with 4.7.2.alpha3 the two patches from #11339 apply ok, but the new skpg fails to compile
(on a 64-bit Core2 under Ubuntu):

```

sage: An error occurred while installing singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /localdisk/tmp/install/sage/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/spkg/build/singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/spkg/build/singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers' && '/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.
```
Any clue?

Paul

I finally managed to apply the 4 patches, I ran `sage -b`, then installed the spkg, then ran
`sage -b` again.

However `Proof=...` seems to be still present somewhere:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2)[]
sage: p=x^8 + y^8; q=x^2*y^4 + x; f=p*q
sage: f.factor(proof=False)
x * (x + y)^8 * (x*y^4 + 1)
sage: f.factor()
...
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
```

-x^5 * y^6 * (x*y^4 + y^3 + 1)
-sage: f
-x^6*y^12 + x^5*y^11 + x^5*y^8
-```
-It seems a factor `y^2` has been lost in the factorization of
-`f` (in addition to the fact that the factorization of `f`
-might be incomplete).
-
-I mark this as critical since we should have at least the following
-equality:
-
-```
-sage: f.factor(proof=False).expand() == f
-False
-```
+There are currently no known counter examples where Singular would return an incorrect factorisation. It might be very very slow but does not return wrong answers as far as we know. Hence, we should drop `proof=False`.

thanks to Jeroen, I've managed to build Sage 5.0.beta13. However the issue reported in comment
[comment:20] is still present, whereas it took about one second in Sage 4.8:

```
sage: K=GF(4,'a')                                                          
sage: a=K.gens()[0]
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: f=(a + 1)*x^145*y^84 + (a + 1)*x^205*y^17 + x^32*y^112 + x^92*y^45
sage: time r=f.factor(proof=False)
Time: CPU 1.08 s, Wall: 1.23 s
sage: r
y^17 * x^32 * (y^67 + x^60) * ((a + 1)*x^113 + y^28)

I'll be happy when this will be reported in another ticket.
