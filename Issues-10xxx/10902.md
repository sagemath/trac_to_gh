Dear Martin,

Replying to [malb](#comment%3A1):
> I reported this upstream: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/320


this ticket is empty on my browser (firefox). Also, is there a workaround to factor bivariate
polynomials over a prime field from within Sage, in particular over GF(2)?

Paul, the Singular developers replied on that ticket and state that this bug is fixed in Singular 3-1-2. Updating to 3-1-2 is now #10903.

As for a workaround, I cannot immediately think of any. It's a pretty grim situation, but at least now there is a Singular developer working on factoring.

thanks Martin. Once Singular is updated to 3-1-2, I will try to find examples where the factorization returned by Singular is incomplete. It would help to have concrete examples
in the documentation.

Is this really so bad?

```
def check(f0, f1):
    CP = CartesianProduct(*[f0.base_ring()]*len(f0.variables()))
    for xvec in CP:
        f0_val = f0.subs(dict((v, xv) for v, xv in zip(f0.variables(), xvec)))
        f1_val = f1.subs(dict((v, xv) for v, xv in zip(f0.variables(), xvec)))
        print xvec, f0_val, f1_val, f0_val == f1_val

sage: f0 = x^5 * y^8 * (x*y^4 + y^3 + 1)
sage: f1 = x^5 * y^6 * (x*y^4 + y^3 + 1)
sage: check(f0, f1)
[0, 0] 0 0 True
[0, 1] 0 0 True
[1, 0] 0 0 True
[1, 1] 1 1 True
```

The factor of `y^2` has no effect, so aren't the two polynomials equivalent in GF(2)?  This happens pretty frequently:

```
sage: f0 = x**8+y**8+1
sage: f1 = f0.factor(proof=False)
sage: f1
(x + y + 1)^6
sage: f1.expand()
x^6 + x^4*y^2 + x^2*y^4 + y^6 + x^4 + y^4 + x^2 + y^2 + 1
sage: check(f0, f1.expand())
[0, 0] 1 1 True
[0, 1] 0 0 True
[1, 0] 0 0 True
[1, 1] 1 1 True
```

Is there a case where the two expressions aren't equivalent as functions?  Or am I missing something obvious like usual?

An example over GF(3):

```

Martin, with 4.7.2.alpha3 the two patches from #11339 apply ok, but the new skpg fails to compile
(on a 64-bit Core2 under Ubuntu):

```

sage: An error occurred while installing singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /localdisk/tmp/install/sage/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/spkg/build/singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers and type 'make check' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
(cd '/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/spkg/build/singular-3-1-3.svn-algnumbers' && '/localdisk/tmp/install/sage/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.
```
Any clue?

I finally managed to apply the 4 patches, I ran `sage -b`, then installed the spkg, then ran
`sage -b` again.

However `Proof=...` seems to be still present somewhere:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2)[]
sage: p=x^8 + y^8; q=x^2*y^4 + x; f=p*q
sage: f.factor(proof=False)
x * (x + y)^8 * (x*y^4 + 1)
sage: f.factor()
...
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
```

thanks to Jeroen, I've managed to build Sage 5.0.beta13. However the issue reported in comment
[comment:20] is still present, whereas it took about one second in Sage 4.8:

```
sage: K=GF(4,'a')                                                          
sage: a=K.gens()[0]
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: f=(a + 1)*x^145*y^84 + (a + 1)*x^205*y^17 + x^32*y^112 + x^92*y^45
sage: time r=f.factor(proof=False)
Time: CPU 1.08 s, Wall: 1.23 s
sage: r
y^17 * x^32 * (y^67 + x^60) * ((a + 1)*x^113 + y^28)
```
I'll be happy when this will be reported in another ticket.
