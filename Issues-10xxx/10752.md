Oops:

```
sage: A=matrix(ZZ, 2, range(4))
sage: p = A.pivots(); p
[0, 1]
sage: p.append(652)
sage: A.pivots()
[0, 1, 652]
```

I'd imagine returning a tuple rather than a list would be the best approach.  Though how much chaos will ensue is not clear.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Here is a new version of the patch.  I think this deals with every instance where something involving the string "pivot" is fetched from the cache.

There are two other ways to proceed, if we don't like this approach:

- cache the pivots as tuples instead of lists, or
- add a keyword to the "pivots" method just like there currently is for "nonzero_positions".  That is, model the definition after this:

```
    def nonzero_positions(self, copy=True, column_order=False):
        """
        Returns the sorted list of pairs (i,j) such that self[i,j] != 0.
        
        INPUT:        
        
        -  ``copy`` - (default: True) It is safe to change the
           resulting list (unless you give the option copy=False).
```
I think the question is, how much of a performance hit is there by copying the list, and are there times when we want to use the unsafe, but faster method.  I don't know the answer to this.  Would the first alternative (caching a tuple) be any better, or would the cached value need to be converted to a list frequently enough that it would slow things down?

Isolating changes at the cache-ing step is a great idea.

As an experiment, I changed all of the list() calls in the patch to tuple().  Here are the observations.  In sage/matrix only,

```
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_cyclo_dense.pyx # 2 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py # 11 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/strassen.pyx # 18 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx # 15 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx # 6 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx # 48 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  /dev/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.pyx # 2 doctests failed
```

About 17 of these end with:

```
    File "/sage/dev/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense_hnf.py", line 607, in interleave_matrices
    w = cols1 + cols2
TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "list") to tuple
```

and this looks like the only failures of this type.  (I didn't know you could concatenate two tuples.)  Six, or so. are sorts of pivots, which could be replaced by sorted(), I'd guess.  The rest seem to be output format (list versus tuple), or unrelated follow-on failures.  So really, I don't think it is that bad.

I'll look more closely in the morning.

Right now I'm leaning away from the current patch and perhaps toward the tuple approach.  If I add a keyword (which I called "safe" so as not to conflict with the "copy" function):

```
sage: A = random_matrix(QQ, 100)
sage: timeit('A.pivots(safe=True)')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.38 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.pivots(safe=False)')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.13 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.pivots(safe=False)')
```
Whereas if I use tuples as output (via another modification of the current patch):

```
sage: A = random_matrix(QQ, 100)
sage: timeit('A.pivots(use_tuple=False)')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.14 µs per loop
sage: timeit('A.pivots(use_tuple=True)')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.55 µs per loop

sage: timeit('A = random_matrix(QQ, 100); A.pivots(use_tuple=False)')
25 loops, best of 3: 22.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit('A = random_matrix(QQ, 100); A.pivots(use_tuple=True)')
25 loops, best of 3: 22.2 ms per loop
```
I suppose using tuples may cause a slow-down in other places, but the "pivots" method gets slowed down by maybe 10%, as opposed to copying the list, which doubles the time.

I'm marking this as "needs work" because I'm not happy with the slowdown in the current patch.

I'm coming around to a preference for tuples, mostly with the idea that any future pivots that get returned may end up being consistent.

I'm happy to do some of the grunt work on fixing code and doctests, I did a bunch of that recently, so have some recent practice.

Will you be at Sage days today?

I was planning to, but things have come up, so I'll be working from home today.  I'll work on a patch for this, and if I run out of energy, I'll pass it on to you.  How does that sound?

625 loops, best of 3: 193 ns per loop
```

Looks really good, John.  Passes long tests and I also did a survey on the patched code with `search_src('cache', 'pivot')` and didn't see anything that was missed (including row pivots).

Should improve the reliability of matrix code, or at least lessen the potential for new bugs.  Positive review.

Some timing.  With the old version:

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ, 3).pivots()
[0, 1, 2]
sage: timeit('random_matrix(QQ, 200).pivots()')
5 loops, best of 3: 85.1 ms per loop

With the new version:

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ, 3).pivots()
(0, 1, 2)
sage: timeit('random_matrix(QQ, 200).pivots()')
5 loops, best of 3: 85.7 ms per loop
