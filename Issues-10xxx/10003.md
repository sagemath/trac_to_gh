Sometimes I would like to use multi-line text inputs for interacts, and to be able to see at least a few lines of that input.  

This ticket extends the input_box control to handle this by using a textarea instead of an input element when a parameter "height" (the number of rows) is greater than 1.

Two quick comments just from reading the patch:

* The docs say about height: "If greater than 1 a value won't be returned until something outside the textarea is clicked." -- is this not true when the height is 1?  If it's true with height=1 and height>1, then there's no reason for this comment.

* Can you put the height argument behind the width argument in both cases, for backwards compatibility for people that called the function without keyword arguments?

OK, I'll put the height behind the width.

The behavior is different with a height > 1, because for height=1 a <input> element is used and then pressing return updates the value.  For height > 1, a <textarea> element is used and then pressing return just gives a newline within the textarea.

Thanks for taking a look.
