The failed doctest are related to the mulitple process doctesting. I get the same on my computer if I use multiple processes, but all tests pass with only a single process.

I guess that has to do with reading the exceptional types from an external file, which cannot be accessed simultaneously from different processes. I add a sentence to the documentation...

maybe -- I will upload a new patch as soon as someone is willing to review it.

We have a notebook server running for all people that want to play with the combinatorial quivers and cluster algebras (which are quite a few!) -- you can log in and play with it at sage.lacim.uqam.ca.

Hi Hugh,

I rearranged the patches, so that the functions

- `_construct_mutation_classes_by_rank`
- `_construct_exceptional_mutation_classes`
- `_save_exceptional_data`

are now in #10538. I also added a function `save_exceptional_data` that saves the data to `SAGE_ROOT/data/cluster_algebra/quiver`. This function is supposed to be imported by the user if needed. The data files are now **not** part of the patch anymore, but can only be created by the user using this function.

Best, Christian

This patch fixes a number of issues and also gives the user more flexibility.  Please see details below (especially 8c)


1) For the .plot() and .show() commands, the default by source code and experimentation is circular = False.

I corrected the documentation to reflect this.

2) standard_quiver was defined twice in a row, so I deleted one of the two copies.

3) The auxiliary commands 

_construct_mutation_classes_by_rank,
_construct_exceptional_mutation_classes,
_save_exceptional_data, and
save_exceptional_data

do not work yet because they require the .mutation_class() command for quivers which were moved into a later patch.

I therefore deleted them from this patch.  We should make sure to remember to include these back into the "mutation_class" patch
that comes after quivers, cluster_seeds, ... in our sequence."

4) The class 'Quiver' has been changed to 'ClusterQuiver' (Associated examples and function calls also changed so that all tests pass)  Future patches would have to be updated accordingly.

5) I edited the principal_extension command so that it adds n frozen variables (corresponding to an identity matrix in the bottom of the B-matrix) *even* if the quiver already contained frozen vertices.  This is important for examples like a cluster algebra from a surface *with boundary*.

6) Renamed "principal_restriction" to "exchangeable_part".
I think this name is a little more descriptive and also .tab will allow better shortcuts for both commands "principal_extension" and "exchangeable_part" this way.

7) Rewrote __init__ command for ClusterQuiver so that it raises an error for unexpected input (e..g ClusterQuiver('whatever') or ClusterQuiver('12345') now raises an error instead of constructing an object as it did before).

8a) In QuiverMutationType.py:

Separated out the cases 

['F', 4, [1,2] ] and ['F', 4, [2,1] ] 
['G', 4, [1,3] ] as well as  ['G', 4, [3,1] ]

in the class QuiverMutationType_Irreducible.

I also added the coercions ['F',4,[2,1]] -> ['F',4,[1,2]] and 
['G',2,[3,1]] -> ['G',2,[1,3]] up front in the Mutation Type Casting list to make this clearer.

Similarly, the values ['GR', [2,n]] and ['TR',1], ['TR',2] are now allowed as inputs to QuiverMuationtType_Irreducible

8b) During this process, I realized that even with my slight edit to the 
_mutation_type_error command  in trac_10527-quiver_mutation_type-gm-additional.patch, it was still incorrect as I forgot to consider the syntax for elliptic G.

While we could make this one line edit to my old patch, it might be just as easy to green-light 10527 as is and then my recent
trac_10538-quiver-gm.patch fixes this.

8c) SIGNIFICANT CHANGE: 

I have changed the behavior of ClusterQuiver(['C',2]),
ClusterQuiver(['GR',[3,7]]), ClusterQuiver(['F',4,[2,1]]), etc.

These are highlighted in the new doctests I added.  The point is that this gives the savvy user an easier time to build common quivers, even though they are mutation-equivalent to the standard quiver of a quiver mutation type we already build.

Try it out, I think you'll like how it now works.

Note for Christian: I tried first using the method we recently discussed over IM, but in the end this seemed cleaner, and I didn't have to change the standard_quiver command in the end.


9) Very subtle bug in mutate command fixed:

If one writes Q.mutate(0,0), Q.mutate(0,1), or Q.mutate(0,2), etc instead of
Q.mutate([0,0]), Q.mutate([0,1]), or Q.mutate([0,2]), there could be weird behavior as Sage interprets the second argument as the parameter 'inplace'.  Warnings are now printed if the user possibly makes this mistake.

Comments on your patch:

- In the documentation, you use

```
sage: MT = Q._mutation_type
```
  Please use

```
sage: MT = Q.mutation_type()
```
  instead since _ methods and attributes should not be used there, if possible.

- "Returns the restriction to the principal part (i.e. exchangeable part) of self. I.e., the subquiver obtained by deleting the frozen vertices of self." contains two times i.e. . Could you change that?

- `if type(inplace) is Integer:` Instead of printing a warning, I would suggest to only allow boolean arguments here, and raise a ValueError otherwise.

- `elif rank == 4 and (twist == [1,2] or twist == [2,1])` Am I seeing it right that you now introduced two QuiverMutationTypes for the two possible twists? I would certainly not like that since both are mutation equivalent. [ I just think about the same kind of behaviour in type D and affine A with an oriented circle - it doesn't seem that you actually treated this case, did you? ] I still prefer the standard quiver method to have an optional argument, but we can maybe discuss that again later today or tomorrow...

Beside that, all changes seem good to me.

Best, Christian

I just re-uploaded my patch.  Christian, thanks for catching those bugs.

* The trailing whitespace should be gone now.  I don't think I introduced any new space, but will double-check after the patchbot is finished re-running.

* I agree with you about .mutation_type() instead of ._mutation_type but we have not defined .mutation_type() yet.

Once we add in the newer patches, we should remember to include editing these doc-tests.

* The wording in exchangeable_part has been changed.

* Yes, that it is better - the warnings in mutate have been turned into Value Errors

* Regarding twist [1,2] and [2,1].  This is a little more subtle.  So 

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['F',4,[1,2]])
```
and 

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['F',4,[2,1]])
``` 
both give you:

```
['F', 4, [1, 2]]
```

In fact,

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['F',4,[2,1]]) == QuiverMutationType(['F',4,[1,2]])
True
```

We have as before:

```
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(['F',4,[1,2]]); Q
Quiver on 6 vertices of type ['F', 4, [1, 2]]

sage: Q2 = ClusterQuiver(['F',4,[1,2]]); Q2
Quiver on 6 vertices of type ['F', 4, [1, 2]]

sage: Q3 = ClusterQuiver(['F',4,[2,1]]); Q3
Quiver on 6 vertices of type ['F', 4, [1, 2]]

sage: Q1._mutation_type == Q3._mutation_type
True

sage: Q1 == Q2
True
```

The difference now is:

```
sage: Q1 == Q3
False
```

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:25'></a>\nChristian, the changes we discussed have now been essentially made:\n\n* The ClusterQuiver constructor passes along all inputs which are of the form QuiverMutationType to .standard_quiver()\n\n* However, does case-by-case handling of (C,2), (F,4, [2,1]), (G,2, (3,1)), 'GR' type, and 'TR' type.\n\nNote that I employed a strategy slightly different than we discussed: I use QuiverMutationType_Irreducible._digraph to get \nthe desired directed graph rather than repeating these lines here.  \n\nIf you want to move some of these lines from QuiverMutationType_Irreducible to here, we can do that, but I wanted to make sure it worked first before trying to pull those lines over.  Also, I'm perfectly happy leaving the lines in QuiverMutationType_Irreducible since it is not a globally defined class, but am open to further discussion.\n\n* I also now allow an input of \n\n```\nsage: QuiverMutationType(['A',[n,0],1])\n['D', n]\n```\n\nwith special cases for small n.\n\nHowever \n\n```\nsage: ClusterQuiver(['A',[n,0],1])\n```\n\nyields the directed cycle quiver of type D_n rather than the standard Dynkin D_n.\n\n* ClusterQuiver now also has the command .mutation_type() which yields the _mutation_type, but without trying to compute it when it is not already known.\n\n* I found out where in our code we are missing doctests.  It is really only for the graphical commands: .plot(), .show() in QuiverMutationType.py and .show(), .interact(), and .save_image() in Quiver.py.\n\nI added a dummy example for .plot() in QuiverMutationType but didn't update the others.  Hopefully adding this one function changed the coverage percentage so that we increase it rather than decrease it (I think that's what made the patchbot unhappy).\n\nWe also have bad coverage in the mutation_class.py file, but state that at the top of the sheet, and I will worry about this another day.",

Christian, the changes we discussed have now been essentially made:

* The ClusterQuiver constructor passes along all inputs which are of the form QuiverMutationType to .standard_quiver()

* However, does case-by-case handling of (C,2), (F,4, [2,1]), (G,2, (3,1)), 'GR' type, and 'TR' type.

Note that I employed a strategy slightly different than we discussed: I use QuiverMutationType_Irreducible._digraph to get 
the desired directed graph rather than repeating these lines here.  

If you want to move some of these lines from QuiverMutationType_Irreducible to here, we can do that, but I wanted to make sure it worked first before trying to pull those lines over.  Also, I'm perfectly happy leaving the lines in QuiverMutationType_Irreducible since it is not a globally defined class, but am open to further discussion.

* I also now allow an input of 

```
sage: QuiverMutationType(['A',[n,0],1])
['D', n]
```

with special cases for small n.

However 

```
sage: ClusterQuiver(['A',[n,0],1])
```

yields the directed cycle quiver of type D_n rather than the standard Dynkin D_n.

* ClusterQuiver now also has the command .mutation_type() which yields the _mutation_type, but without trying to compute it when it is not already known.

* I found out where in our code we are missing doctests.  It is really only for the graphical commands: .plot(), .show() in QuiverMutationType.py and .show(), .interact(), and .save_image() in Quiver.py.

I added a dummy example for .plot() in QuiverMutationType but didn't update the others.  Hopefully adding this one function changed the coverage percentage so that we increase it rather than decrease it (I think that's what made the patchbot unhappy).

We also have bad coverage in the mutation_class.py file, but state that at the top of the sheet, and I will worry about this another day.

You can figure out how the documetation looks like by using

# sage -docbuild reference html

and then look at the index.html specified at the end. I will do it myself but don't have time today to do it anymore...

Hi Dylan --

I folded your review into my patch. I did that because patchbot doesn't run patches by people it "doesn't know" (I don't have a proper definition here), and it is better if we see the green light before actually setting the positive review.

From my side, you can go forward and do so, as soon as the patchbot is done without finding anything.

Thanks for looking closely at the patch!

Christian

> There is a minor issue in qmu_save: it does not work whenever the quiver has 0<m!=n frozen vertices.
> Please include the attached patch.


Hi Salvatore,

Thanks for finding the bug with qmu_save with frozen vertices.  Since this ticket has already closed, I suggest opening up a new ticket which is simply the trac_10538_qmu_save.patch.

Since it is small, I can review this quickly and then it should be able to be merged into the latest sage quickly.

See Ticket #14638 for a similar example. 

Gregg
