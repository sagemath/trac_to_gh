Consider the following with Sage 4.4.4:

```
sage: RD = RealField(53, rnd='RNDD')
sage: RU = RealField(53, rnd='RNDU')
sage: a=RD(1/3)
sage: RU(1/a)
3.00000000000000
sage: RU(1/a.exact_rational())
3.00000000000001
```
I would expect both results to be equal, since a is exactly representable in 53-bit precision. However it seems in `RU(1/a)`
that `1/a` is evaluated with rounding down, whereas I would
expect it evaluated with rounding up.

Maybe `1/a` is first evaluated before `RU` is called on it?

Yes, this is definitely the case.  `1/a` is evaluated before it even "sees" the `RU`.

```

sage: RD = RealField(53, rnd='RNDD')
sage: RU = RealField(53, rnd='RNDU')
sage: a=RD(1/3)
sage: 1/RU(a)
3.00000000000001
sage: RU(1/a.exact_rational())
3.00000000000001
```

ok, then I change this ticket as invalid.
