Reported by the "Report a Problem" Form:

When typing the following:

```
S = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
one = S(0) + S(1)
one.order
```

I get a "Infinite series order" message. When asking for

```
one.coefficients(3)
```
I get "[0, 0, 0]".

Looking into the code sage/combinat/species/series.py, the `_add_` method calls the _new method to create the sum series. Trying:

```
zero = S(0)
test_series = zero._new(lambda ao: Stream(const=1), lambda: 0)
test_series.order
test_series.coefficients(3)
```
I again get "Infinite series order" and "[0, 0, 0]".

As I understand it, the _new() method calls the __init__() method of LazyPowerSeries in the line:

```
new_fps = self.__class__(parent, stream=None, order=unk, aorder=self.aorder, aorder_changed=True, is_initialized=False)
```
If the value self.aorder is inf, this puts new_fps.aorder to inf, which (in the __init__() code), also puts new_fps.order to inf, which makes Sage think that the series has infinite order.

Changing the argument aorder=self.aorder to aorder=unk in the above line solved the problem.
The sum of S(0) and S(1) should have order zero, and its first three coefficients should be [1, 0, 0].

The series test_series should also have order zero, and its coefficients should be [1, 1, 1].
