The new plot legends look great, but generate an error when you try to save them.

For example:

```
a1 = plot(sin,-pi,pi,legend_label='sin')
a2 = plot(cos,-pi,pi,legend_label='cos',rgbcolor='red')
two_plots = a1+a2
two_plots.save('./two_plots.png')
```

gives the error:

```
KeyError: 'pop(): dictionary is empty'
```

Then a probably related issue is that this saving command:

```
plot(x,(x,0,1),aspect_ratio=1).save('test.png')
```

does *not* save a plot with aspect_ratio=1.  If this isn't related, I guess we should open a new ticket.

I would think that the legend info would show up in _extra_kwds, but I my understanding of the plotting code is weak.

This does fix the original problem.  That should be doctested, something like

```
sage: P = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$')
sage: P.set_legend_options(back_color=(1,0,0))
sage: P.set_legend_options(loc=7)
sage: P.save() # but with the usual temp saving directory used!
```

It does NOT seem to fix Jason's issue with

```
plot(x,(x,0,1),aspect_ratio=1).save('test.png')
```
Nor does it fix this :(

```
sage: P = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$')
sage: P.set_legend_options(back_color=(1,0,0))
sage: P # has nasty red background for label
sage: Q = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$')
sage: Q = plot(x,(x,0,1),legend_label='$xyz$',legend_back_color=(1,0,0))

So we aren't done yet.  But probably that should be a different ticket, since these suboptions didn't work before anyway.  Apparently we never doctested them!  Which is probably my and/or Jason's fault... :(

Sorry - to be clear, the 'needs work' is with respect to the doctest which is needed.

Jason's thing is probably about `SHOW_OPTIONS` having `aspect_ratio` but `save` not having it directly defined.  Interestingly, in the documentation for `save()`, this example DOES work.

```

        EXAMPLES::
        
            sage: c = circle((1,1),1,color='red')
            sage: filename=os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'test.png')
            sage: c.save(filename, xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=3)

        To correct the aspect ratio of certain graphics, you can 
        set the ``aspect_ratio`` to 1::
        
            sage: c.save(filename, aspect_ratio=1, xmin=-1, xmax=3, ymin=-1, ymax=3)
```
But I think this is because we have new defaults for `aspect_ratio`, not because this works in general.

```
sage: c = circle((1,1),1,color='red')
sage: c.save(xmin=-1,xmax=5,aspect_ratio=4) # works
sage: c = circle((1,1),1,color='red',aspect_ratio=4)
sage: c.save(xmin=-1,xmax=5) # still aspect ratio 1
```

Any thoughts on how many tickets this should all get divided into?

The plot code is already pretty hard for newcomers to find their way around, despite simplifications and refactorings of the past, so more help is great.

Well, in principal `toric_plotter` (which is merged and is in the global name space) is concrete and working.

It has inside a dictionary for "Sage default options" and another one for "current user default options." Users can use commands like `toric_plotter.options(ray_thickness=2)` to change defaults for consecutive commands (and I found it very convenient for use with SageTeX, where "Sage defaults" don't work nicely). There is no separation into options that are easy to change and options that are difficult to change, all are treated in the same way.

When a fan or a cone is plotted, it starts with a copy of "current user default options" and replaces any values in it with arguments of the plot command, if any. Then these options are used for actual plotting.

Also, all toric plotting commands have a reference to `toric_plotter.options` so all options are described in a singe place, eliminating redundancy and improving consistency.

So I was thinking of something like `plot.options(xmin=-10, xmax=10, color="red")` to affect all future plotting commands in the session. One of the drawbacks of current decorators like

```
sage: plot.options
{'fillalpha': 0.5, 'detect_poles': False, 'plot_points': 200, 'thickness': 1,
 'alpha': 1, 'adaptive_tolerance': 0.01, 'fillcolor': 'automatic',
 'adaptive_recursion': 5, 'exclude': None, 'legend_label': None,
 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'fill': False}
```
is that there is no description of options and they are not always easy to understand, e.g. what is `adaptive_recursion`? This is especially important if some options are "smartly" chosen based on others. E.g. it would be reasonable to set `fill=True` if the user has explicitly provided `fillcolor`, but such a behaviour should be explained. Note that in `circle.options` there is `FACEcolor` instead of `FILLcolor`. I suppose they are the same but got named differently because of writing the same thing in different places. Inconsistency in naming parameters and their interpretation also makes it hard to write plotting code that works both for 2d and 3d, leading to extra `if dim == 2: ... elif dim ==3: ...` for no good reason.

Unfortunately, I already put a bit on my plate so rewriting plotting code is not on my todo list for now and I just complain...

Okay, this should apply correctly.  

To buildbot: Depends on #7981 and #8632, apply only trac_10244_legend_label_fix_v3.patch

I noticed a few other things that apparently weren't caught the first time (meaning they were already present before this ticket), and may fix them in a brief reviewer patch shortly.

Turns out that some of the defaults weren't the same as the documentation.  The legends look nice, so I changed the documentation to reflect the defaults.
