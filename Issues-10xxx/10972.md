I would consider this a bug, but because it should return a symbolic 
expression. 
sage: a = sin(pi) 
sage: a 
0 
sage: type(a) 
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'> 
It's possible to get this behavior: 
sage: type(sin(0,hold=True).simplify()) 
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'> 
Anyway, this is an oversight, I would say.  Anyone else care to 
comment?  Otherwise it would be great if you'd file a bug report. 
This is important to fix, because some Sage code depends on the input 
in integer form being Sage integer or something else with Sage 
methods, not a Python int, and one could imagine someone relying on 
this and getting a nasty exception.
