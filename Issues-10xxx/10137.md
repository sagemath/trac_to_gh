With a 64-bit build (`export SAGE64=yes`) of Sage 4.6.alpha3 on bsd.math (OS X 10.6 i386), I get this doctest failure:

I think we can fix this by using `-...` instead of `---...` in the "Expected" output, but I'm not sure about why

```
    -bit mode

appears in the "Got" output but not with `./sage`, say.

Ticket #9446 is about a different problem in `trace.py`.

I've many times tried building Sage 64-bit on Solaris or OpenSolaris and then set `SAGE64=yes`. I've often seen the message:

```
Creating SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt since it does not exist
```

when the file should have existed. There's no reason that file should ever be (re)created more than once, so something must be unnecessarily creating that file. (Either that, or something is unnecessarily deleting it, so it needs to be recreated, which seems a less likely cause). 

The idea of that file is apparently to stop someone building a 64-bit version of Sage, then upgrading it a later date, but this time with SAGE64 unset, which would result in a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit objects. I can see that is sensible - for someone who has builds with SAGE64 set and builds with it unset, it is easy to get in a mess and get a mix of 32-bit ans 64-bit objects. 

The opposite problem can also exist too. One can start a 32-bit build, then try to upgrade, with SAGE64=yes set by accident. The file `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt` does not protect against this. One still gets a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit objects, which causes a mess.

I believe an optimal solution would be he file `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt` should **always** be created, and it have either the word "yes" or "no" in it, depending on whether SAGE64=yes when the build started or not. Then the Sage environment should 

* export SAGE64=yes if the file contains the word "yes"
* unset SAGE64 if the file contains the word "no". 

Currently it appears the file does not fully protect against mixing 32-bit and 64-bit objects, and for reasons unknown is being created more than once. 

I think since bsd.math creates 64-bit objects by default, you will not actually see the mix of 32-bit and 64-bit objects that can happen on Solaris. But for any Solaris system, and any OS X system where the default it to build 32-bit objects, the protection system that this file is supposed to address is not addressed very well.

I tried the suggestion (replacing "---..." with "-..." and it does "fix" the problem: prior to the change, every test of "trace.py" failed as shown above; after the change, all tests pass for this file.

I have no clue why that works, but then I don't know how any of the testing mechanisms work.

Yep. We've noticed the odd message earlier (you also get it when you start **anything** by running `./sage ...`, i.e. even if you don't want to build anything.)

Simple fix: Redirect all output to `stderr`, and don't redirect `stderr` to `/dev/null` when sourcing `sage-check-64` in `sage-env` (if at all).

Note that previously one would never have seen that message, even when it *was* perhaps important.

On the other hand, I see no reason for having it *there* (`sage-env`):

```sh
...
if [ "$SAGE64" != "yes" -a "$SAGE64" != "no" ]; then
    echo "The environment variable SAGE64 (=$SAGE64) must be either unset, yes or no."
    exit 1
fi

# In case SAGE64 has been set to yes before re-inject it into the environment
# This is only done on OSX and Solaris since those are the only real multi lib
# arches we support. Eventually Linux PPC on the PS3 might need to be added here
source $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-check-64 2> /dev/null
export SAGE64
...
```
`sage-check-64`:

```sh
...
if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
    CHECKFILE="no"
    if [ `uname` = "SunOS" ]; then
        echo "Building Sage on Solaris in 64-bit mode"
        CHECKFILE="yes"
    fi
    if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
        echo "Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode"
        CHECKFILE="yes"
    fi
    if [ $CHECKFILE = "yes" ]; then
        if ! [ -d "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib ]; then
            echo "Creating SAGE_LOCAL/lib since it does not exist"
            mkdir "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib
        fi
        echo "Creating SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt since it does not exist"
        touch "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/sage-64.txt
    fi
fi

# Check if SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt exists. If it does on Solaris and OSX
# force the setting of SAGE64

if [ -a "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/sage-64.txt ]; then
    echo "Detected SAGE64 flag"
    if [ `uname` = "SunOS" ]; then
        echo "Building Sage on Solaris in 64-bit mode"
        SAGE64="yes"; export SAGE64
    fi
    if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
        echo "Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode"
        SAGE64="yes"; export SAGE64
    fi
fi
```

So in principle, `sage-check-64` shouldn't be sourced from `sage-env`, but only by those scripts actually building something (and/or perhaps `sage-sage` if it calls such a script).

:-) Apparently `sage-64.txt` will **always** be touched whenever `SAGE64=yes` (on MacOS X or Solaris); I can't see a test there.

Weird logic... (and not very efficient btw.)

I don't see the point in having these Solaris and OS X specific tests. Better to make it work for any platform. 

The whole bit of code needs looking at, since apart from the messages it prints, it works sub-optimally as noted above.

Just wondering: Doesn't MacOS X 10.**6** *default* to 64-bit builds? (In which case you wouldn't have to set `SAGE64=yes`.)

Doesn't help on other OSs (needing `SAGE64`) of course.

This is from MPIR's `spkg-install`, if `SAGE64` is *not* "yes"...:

```sh
            # Do not set ABI=32 on OS X 10.6, since there everything
            # defaults to 64-bit:
            ...

I'm not sure if it helps, but on bsd.math (OS X 10.6) a non-`SAGE64=yes` build gives

```sh
$ ./sage -c "print is_64_bit"
True
```
A `SAGE64=yes` build yields

```sh
$ ./sage -c "print is_64_bit"
Detected SAGE64 flag
Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode
True
```
Is there a better way to check whether both builds are essentially the same on this machine?

I was referring to the useless messages ("Detected SAGE64 flag .... Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode") which used to disturb (not just) doctests, since they went to `stdout` as well.  Although #10303 bit-rottened for a while, this is meanwhile fixed.

So this ticket can IMHO be closed as fixed.  (No need to change the doctest, because the failure was solely caused by that message.)
