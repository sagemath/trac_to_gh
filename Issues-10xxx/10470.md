Asking for a list of elements in an infinite vector space does not raise an error, but requires a Ctrl-C to get back the command-line.

```
sage: V=QQ^2
sage: V
Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
sage: V.list()
<hang>
```

Of course, finite examples work properly:

```
sage: V=GF(3)^2
sage: V.list()
[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)]
```

Maybe this should be addressed in the module code, I have not looked into the cause much.  Perhaps a fix could be as simple as having a non-zero dimension with an infinite base ring throwing an error?

It seems `ZZ` and `QQ` and (maybe others) have never-ending iterators.  So an attempt to iterate over modules like `ZZ^2` or `QQ^2` just keep making linear combinations like crazy, but never coming to any finite conclusion.  Testing a fix now.

This was discussed further on sage-devel:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3bb0f163b1fb1020

Patch just checks to see if a parent *knows* that is infinite, and if so, bails out with an explanation.  Otherwise behavior should be the same.  Passes the full test suite.

I'm happy with the main patch: it gets a positive review.  I've added a little documentation about using `X.list()` vs. `list(X)`.  If it's not appropriate, let me know and we can just go with the main patch.
