This patch fixes an oversight concerning the relabelling of structures of compositions of species and implements equality for structures.

In particular, it modifies the list method for partitions to take into account the labels, so it can be used by the methods change_labels and transport of CompositionSpeciesStructure.

Moreover, it modifies `__eq__` of GenericSpeciesStructure to raise a NotImplementedError in case equality for the structures of the species in question has not been implemented.  Ideally, the error message should state which species that is, but I do not know how to access that information.  Same thing for change_labels in GenericSpeciesStructure.
