How do I review this?  What I mean is that I already have the Mac app, so somewhere there is a plist or something that encodes whatever the last setting I had for server starting was.  I don't remember where it is, but I assume if I remove it then it will go back to the default.

So just let me know where that is, and I will remove it and then restart the Sage app, giving (hopefully) positive review!

(On the plus side, opening the plist in the Property List Editor (after applying the patch) did indeed have the correct default, so I could almost give positive review based on that alone.  But not quite.)
