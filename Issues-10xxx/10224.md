There exists a new upstream versions of saclib and qepcad that compile on 64 bit machines at https://www.usna.edu/CS/qepcadweb/INSTALL/IQ.html

Sources:
- http://www.usna.edu/CS/qepcadweb/INSTALL/saclib2.2.6.tar.gz
- http://www.usna.edu/CS/qepcadweb/INSTALL/qepcad-B.1.69.tar.gz

Copy both tarballs into your `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream` directory and rename `saclib2.2.6.tar.gz` to `saclib-2.2.6.tar.gz`


There could be some improvements to the QEPCAD interface, but it would probably be better for me to open separate tickets and base them on the updated spkg.

Another thing that would be good to include is Chris Brown's SLFQ program

https://www.usna.edu/CS/qepcadweb/SLFQ/Home.html

which calls QEPCAD B. I have gotten SLFQ to build outside of sage with a couple of patches, but I have not actually gotten it to work yet.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Works fine for me. (Ubuntu 10.10)

But did you make a Mercurial update of your changes?
If I build your package I get:

Created package qepcad-1.54.p0.spkg.

    NAME: qepcad
 VERSION: 1.54.p0
    SIZE: 4.0M
 HG REPO: Unchecked in changes
SPKG.txt: Good

Btw: Version 1.55 is out, perhaps try to use the new source.

Regards,
Stefan

There's a fork of qepcad with a CMake-based build system here: [https://github.com/PetterS/qepcad](https://github.com/PetterS/qepcad)

Still does not compile on Mac OS X because of gnu-libc-isms such as using "ieee754.h"

Helloooooooooooo,

Just leaving a note here that if you create a new-style package that replaces an old-style package (it seems to be the case for qepcad?) then somebody should ask Harald to remove the old-style package from the "optional/" folder on the mirrors, and move it to the "archive/" folder instead.

Otherwise we will be having consistency problems at some point.

Thanks,

Nathann

I propose to add a "not tested" flag to those examples in order not to pollute the tutorial, and then add tests that transforms the string to a set of substrings so that we can test equality. Does it makes sense ?

I meant: among the occurrences of `# optional - qepcad` i removed the uselesses, that is the one for which the tests can be run without `qepcad` installed.

Typically, the calls to `qepcad_formula` do only create some srtings, they not require `qepcad` to be installed. Only the calls to the `qepcad` command require `qepcad` to be installed.

Better use `# random` instead of `# not tested` if you want to run the tests but not check the output.

Actually, the tests tagged `# not tested` are run in the `TESTS:` section that follows the `EXAMPLE:` section where it appears, but there, the output is sent to a function that makes a set of atoms so that the difference of ordering (that seems arch dependent) is taken into account. So, be both have meaningful user-friendly examples and the doctest are still executed and partially checked. Hence, if i replace `# not tested` with `# random` in the `EXAMPLE:` section, those tests will be run twice and take longer. I do not mind doing this, but i do not see the point since any test is already run at least once. Tell me.

OK, I see your point.

One reason to still have `# random` is to make it more explicit that the output of the test is random. When a test says "not tested", it is not clear why it is not tested. At the very least, write something like `# not tested (random order)`.

How much time do those tests take? If we're talking about a few seconds, then I would just use `# random`.

And the reviewer name is still missing.

Given that it fails consistently with "make -j2" and most likely parallel building is enabled, shouldn't the build script enforce "make -j1" rather than mention it somewhere?..

This issue's component is `packages: optional`. Currently the package is 'experimental'.
In order to promote it to 'optional', it needs to [build on all supported systems](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#inclusion-procedure-for-new-and-updated-packages). Is this already the case?
