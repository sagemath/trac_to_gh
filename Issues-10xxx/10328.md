Here is a patch for flint-1.5.2, which only modifies what gets built on ARM 32-bits.

I can confirm that with that change, flint-1.5.2 builds -- and all tests end up ok.

The issue has been discussed upstream ; they're ok with a sage-only patch, since they're focusing on flint2.

I built my own spkg by :

* taking the current flint spkg ;

* putting the 1.5.2 version of flint in src/ instead of the current 1.5.0 ;

* copying src/longlong.h to patches/

* copying the attached patch to patches/

* applying it to the patches/longlong.h

In spkg-install, I also added two lines :

# Patched longlong.h doesn't produce invalid assembly on 32-bit ARM

cp patches/longlong.h src/

Then I packed it into flint-1.5.2.??.spkg, and put it in ~/sage/spkg/standard/ ; removing the current flint spkg.

The following is updated as requested:

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/flint-1.5.2.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/flint-1.5.2.p0.spkg)

Btw, FLINT 1.6 is on the way, too.

FLINT 1.6 was released on/for Chrismas (Dec. 24th).

Unless somebody else already did/does I'll open a ticket to upgrade Sage's version to that one.

Since Sage currently does weird things with the Makefile, providing a new, "clean" spkg will take some time (besides testing collaboration with the new FLINT of course).

(Though FLINT is a **plain C** library, with a **separate** module to interface with NTL, which is C++ and hence the interface as well, Sage builds one monolithic "FLINT" library with that interface module included such that it always depends on the NTL library and the C++ standard library, which is totally odd and frequently causes trouble. Changing that requires changes to the *Sage library*, including `module_list.py` and perhaps `setup.py`, too.)

The removal is unconditional because the code is conditional anyway : if it's not there, then we fall back on C code which compiles and runs. Not optimal, but there is no working optimised code for the platform anyway, so there's no regression.
