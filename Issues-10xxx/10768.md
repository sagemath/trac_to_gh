The current pickle jar mechanism has some drawbacks:

- We never add new pickles to the pickle jar

- We don't know how old pickles in the pickle jar are

- We may be testing an old pickle, but not a recent one

- Updating specific pickles is a bit tedious

Here is a new proposal:

1. Pickles will no longer be stored in a `.tar.bz2` file but simply as **files** within the directory `extcode/pickle_jar/$VERSION`.  This will likely increase the on-disk space needed for a Sage install, but will not have a big influence on Sage distributions, since we have an extcode spkg anyway (which is tarred and compressed).
2. Pickles will be **under `git` control** (this will now become possible).
3. The `$VERSION` in the directory name refers to the Sage version used to create the pickle. Once a pickle has been made, it will remain in place in that directory, even in subsequent Sage versions (so sage-4.7.2 will contain `pickle_jar/4.7`, `pickle_jar/4.7.1` and `pickle_jar/4.7.2`).
4. When making a new release, the release manager will unpickle all old pickles and repickle them with the new Sage version.  Whenever a pickle has changed, the new (changed) pickle will be stored in `pickle_jar/$NEWVERSION`.  The old pickle is kept where it was.
5. sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all will check all pickles (old and new).
6. If some day some pickle rots away and it is decided by consensus to not support unpickling it anymore, then the patch author would simply `git remove` the old pickle.

One major advantage of *not* having the tar file would be that the pickle jar could be updated using standard `hg` commands.  This would instantly solve 2 of the 3 complaints:
1. Using `hg log`, we would know exactly how old everything is
3. Updating specific pickles would become as easy as adding a patch to the Sage library.

Nicolas, just to make sure I understand you correctly, is your proposal the following:

1. Pickle jars are named after the Sage version (i.e. we would have a pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2 file or a pickle_jar-4.6.2 directory in my proposal).
2. We always *keep* the old versions unchanged (so sage-4.7 would still contain pickle_jar-4.6.2).
3. With every new Sage version, the release manager unpickles pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION, repickles them using the new Sage version and saves them as pickle_jar-$NEWVERSION.

I can see some merit to this proposal, however I would save only the pickles which actually changed.  Otherwise you will end up with lots of copies of the same pickle.

+1, definitely! Actually I did not suggest it earlier because I was
worrying about the disk space usage, not for the Sage distribution but
for the Sage install. But if there is a consensus that this is well
used disk space, let's go for it.

I was also wondering whether this could possibly slow down
unpickle_all since this would require loading lots of little files
instead of slurping in one large archive. Any clue?

Hi Jeroen!

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:4):
> Nicolas, just to make sure I understand you correctly, is your proposal the following:

I am going to use the occasion to amend a bit the proposal :-)

> 1. Pickle jars are named after the Sage version (i.e. we would have a pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2 file or a pickle_jar-4.6.2 directory in my proposal).

Yes.

> 1. We always *keep* the old versions unchanged (so sage-4.7 would still contain pickle_jar-4.6.2).

Yes. More precisely sage-4.7 would still contain the subset of the
pickles in pickle_jar-4.6.2 that:

- still unpickles properly in sage-4.7
- differ from the corresponding pickle in 4.7 (and any intermediate version)

> 1. With every new Sage version, the release manager unpickles pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION, repickles them using the new Sage version and saves them as pickle_jar-$NEWVERSION.

More precisely: the release manager recreates a fresh pickle jar by running all the sage tests with SAGE_PICKLE_JAR set (as described in unpickle_all). And then removes from pickle_jar-$OLDVERSION those that did not change. An easy thing to script.

> I can see some merit to this proposal, however I would save only the pickles which actually changed.  Otherwise you will end up with lots of copies of the same pickle.

+1; this is a good refinement of the last point in the ticket description. The comments above should take care of this.

Note that if the pickle_jar for 3.1 and 4.6.2 contain the same pickle X (version numbers just for the example), then I prefer to delete that of 3.1 and keep that of 4.6.2. Indeed, if X does not unpickle anymore with 4.7, then the relevant question is: "is it acceptable to not unpickle in 4.7 a pickle generated by 4.6.2?".

Do you mind rephrasing the ticket description accordingly, and then make a quick call for comments on sage-devel?

Thanks!

Cheers,
					Nicolas

If we use `hg` to track the pickles, I actually think it is better not to constantly move pickles from one version to another.  So while I understand your point, from a practical point of view, I prefer to keep the pickle in the old directory of the old version.

Currently, the pickle jar contains 1174 files.  Assuming each file takes 4kB of actual disk space, this would use a few megabytes.  I don't think this is an issue.

This would depend very much on the operating system and file system...
But yes, on some systems this will be slower.  On the other hand, it could even speed up things by not having to decompress and untar.

-- For each version of Sage (say 4.6.2), a fresh pickle jar (say
-  pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2) would be produced by the release manager,
-  and *added* to the Sage distribution.
+1. Pickles will no longer be stored in a `.tar.bz2` file but simply as **files** within the directory `extcode/pickle_jar/$VERSION`.  This will likely increase the on-disk space needed for a Sage install, but will not have a big influence on Sage distributions, since we have an extcode spkg anyway (which is tarred and compressed).
+2. Pickles will be **under `hg` control** (this will now become possible).
+3. The `$VERSION` in the directory name refers to the Sage version used to create the pickle. Once a pickle has been made, it will remain in place in that directory, even in subsequent Sage versions (so sage-4.7.2 will contain `pickle_jar/4.7`, `pickle_jar/4.7.1` and `pickle_jar/4.7.2`).
+4. When making a new release, the release manager will unpickle all old pickles and repickle them with the new Sage version.  Whenever a pickle has changed, the new (changed) pickle will be stored in `pickle_jar/$NEWVERSION`.  The old pickle is kept where it was.
+5. sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all will check all pickles (old and new).
+6. If some day some pickle rots away and it is decided by consensus to not support unpickling it anymore, then the patch author would simply `hg remove` the old pickle.
 
-- sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all would be run by default on all pickle jars included with Sage.
-
-- If some day some pickle rots away and it is decided *by consensus*
-  to not support unpickling it anymore, then the patch author would
-  include a note to the release manager to delete
-  pickle_jar-4.6.2.tar.bz2/__class__s.....sobj
-
-  This can be done by just copy-pasting from the error message of
-  unpickle_all, without having to learn how to manipulate the jar.
-
-- If space really becomes an issue, then pickle jars from old Sage
-  distributions could be moved to an optional spkg. Also, if a pickle
-  jar does not change at all between two versions, or only contains
-  new pickles, then the previous one can be deleted.

Hi Nicolas,

I want to add to your proposal that the pickle_jar be properly documented. As far as I am aware, there is currently no documentation on what the pickle jar is for, how it should be used, and what to do when a pickle breaks with

```
sage -t  devel/sage-sf/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
```
for example. A non-trivial example for using `register_unpickle_override` should also be added.

Secondly, I think that the procedure for adding new pickles to the jar needs to streamlined. Again, I don't believe that it is described anywhere when or how this happens, but I do know that there are many "new" classes which are not represented in the pickle_jar with the consequence that the pickle_jar is unable to check backward compatibility for these classes.

Hi Volker!

I don't have a good view on the order of magnitudes. Yet, with the proposed protocol, pickles that don't change don't get duplicated between versions, and I'd expect that only a few pickles get changed from one version to the other (especially if we emphasize pickling by construction rather than by internal data structure). A good experiment would be to regenerate a new pickle jar, and see how much we have added to it since last time!

I don't have a strong opinion about whether the pickle jar should be maintained under git or not. If we can affor it, that makes things easier, as changes to the pickle jar can be done within the usual workflow. But if it's too big, it's too big.

Cheers,
                                      Nicolas
