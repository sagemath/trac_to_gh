This patch implements 
* the Spec of affine toric varieties. 
* patches for algebraic schemes with singular ambient toric varieties
In particular, Sage can now compute the dimension and smoothness for algebraic subschemes of singular toric varieties as well.

This uses both the Hilbert basis for cones and the algebraic schemes, and, therefore, depends on
* #10525: move algebraic subschemes of toric varieties to their rightful places
* #9918: triangulate point configurations
* #10023: Compute Hilbert basis of cone
* #10529: dimension() and is_smooth() for algebraic subschemes of toric varieties

**Apply**

Looks good!

For the second patch:
5. (line 433) The implementation looks very confusing to me: why would you store in the field `embedding_morphism` an exception??? I would expect either returning the stored value if it exists, or constructing the default embedding into the ambient space...
1. (line 441) Am I right that `embedding_origin` may be a non-origin as in not (0,0,0)? In this case I kind of really don't like using the word `origin`, how about `marked_point` instead or `embegging_marking` or `embedding_center` to put it next to the embedding?
2. (line 1847) There should be no "local", this scheme is just isomorphic to a neighbourhood of the point.
3. (line 1859) <code>\`\`result.embedding_morphism\`\`</code> should be more like <code>:meth:\`embedding_morphism\`</code> or at least <code>\`\`result.embedding_morphism()\`\`</code>, same for (1862).
4. (line 2076) `affine_patch` was used for compatibility with projective spaces, do we really need to change its name? If yes, then a) the old name should be kept as well for compatibility, b) how about `covering_patch` since toric varieties are printed as `covered by 5 affine patches`?
5. "algebraic" attached to patches seems a bit weird to me...
6. Aha, now I see that `affine_patch` is preserved. Now the question is - do we really need three functions or maybe `affine_patch` with several forms of input will do?..
7. (line 2169) Why 0 is listed as one of the ideal generators?
8. (line 2193) You have actually added a possibility to construct lattice polytopes from a list of points, without packing them into a matrix and then transposing ;-)

Andrey reported a performance regression in Sage-4.7.1.alpha2 for the long doctests. The reason is that the syntax for computing the LLL-reduced kernel changed from `A.right_kernel(LLL=True)` to `A.right_kernel(basis='LLL')`. Unfortunately #10746 did not add a deprecation warning, but then we were the only users of the `LLL=True` syntax. The result was that Sage-4.7.1.alpha2 computed the naive ideal with the echelon form of the kernel and not the LLL-reduced form, which makes the Groebner basis computations much much harder.

The updated patch switches to the new syntax and works as fast as before.
