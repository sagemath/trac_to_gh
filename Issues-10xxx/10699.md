The file e_one_star.py was merged recently into sage. After using it a bit for our research, we suggest the following improvements:

* Add `extra_code_before` and `extra_code_after` arguments to the `plot_tikz` method.
* Macros don't work when using sagetex. Remove the macros loza, lozb, lozc: just print the plain tikz code.
* Allow the options `iterations=0` in the `__call__` method of `E1Star`.
* Be able to plot patches made of unit segments (discrete lines).
* Add the Patch method `.occurences_in` which returns the positions at which a patch appears in an other patch.
* Change the default color map for the `.repaint` method (it's just nicer).
* Add the `.faces_of_vector` method for `Patch`.
* Fix a small bug: allow the type of a face and of the letters of a substitution to be `int`, and not only `Integer`.
* Some other small fixes and documentation details.
