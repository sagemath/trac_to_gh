In sage-4.6.1, the following plot command results in a crash:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: 1/(x^2-0.5^2), (-10, 10), ymin=-5, ymax=5)
/opt/sage/local/bin/sage-sage: line 300:  5596 Illegal instruction      (core dumped) sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

Note that the following modified version works fine:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: 1/(x^2-1^2), (-10, 10), ymin=-5, ymax=5)
```

Hmmm.  This ticket should definitely be closed as invalid.

I don't actually know what happened.  The machine I got this on runs Arch Linux and is rather slow for building sage from scratch, so I have been using the binaries packaged with Arch.  Since I ran into the problem there have been a couple of updates for these binaries so maybe something was slightly off and is now ok.  Or maybe something else was messed up in my setup and now is back to normal.  In any case, I cannot reproduce this anymore.

If someone is really keen on doing detective work on this, I could probably downgrade my sage binaries and try to catch this again.
