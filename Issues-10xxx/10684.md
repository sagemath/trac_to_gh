```
In sage-4.6.1, the following plot command results in a crash:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: 1/(x^2-0.5^2), (-10, 10), ymin=-5, ymax=5)
/opt/sage/local/bin/sage-sage: line 300:  5596 Illegal instruction      (core dumped) sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

Note that the following modified version works fine:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: 1/(x^2-1^2), (-10, 10), ymin=-5, ymax=5)
```
