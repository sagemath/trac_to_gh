makes it *much* easier to move interacts to the library since you don't have to define every single thing you use from the sage library.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I'm a little surprised that there aren't circular import problems here, so this should definitely be tested.  If it works, it's a big win for making interacts easier to port to the library.

Marshall, can you test this and turn it into a real patch?
