I've been playing with the worksheet for a little while now and it looks really good.  My own interest in using Sage for differential geometry is more in the area of symbolic computations (if I never have to manipulate a Riemann tensor ever again I will be a happy man), but I think curves and surfaces should be developed too and would form an important selling point for Sage.

Some comments: 
 
* From personal experience, it turns out to be a bit of work to "sagify" a python class (make sure that it coerces properly, doctests pass, etc.) I could help with that.

* There is a differential forms class at #9650 that is being merged into Sage.  I see that the representation of tensors in your class is very similar to the internal representation of forms.  As a long term goal (i.e. not for this ticket) it would be good to have interoperability with this class and (future) classes for Riemannian geometry in Sage.

The interoperability between future classes in the differential geometry is one of the most important point in development. Therefore, it would be good to have like a coordination center of the differential geometric part of SAGE, but I do not know how to organize it. Any ideas?

Also, in my point of view, the natural way to work on differential geometry in SAGE is to start from elementary differential geometry (curves and surfaces), then Riemannian geometry, then connections in bundles, etc.

It may be useful to consider creating some classes for "generic manifolds" and then specialize them to curves and surfaces. This can be useful to ensure uniform interface in the future and have a possibility right from the start to put "generic methods" into appropriate places. (I am not sure which ones, but like `is_compact` or maybe chart access can be made general.)

I had a great time playing with this code during the weekend and I am really looking forward to the time where I'll be able to take a book on curves and surfaces and work through the examples using Sage.

to Joris
 
The work you did is really great. Thank you also for the reference to the page with instructions. I have just come back to Bogota, so I could not look in details in the code improvements you did. I will carefully study them and then comment in details. Anyway, it is incredible help.

Now concerning the remarks:

>Sometimes the terminology "vector" is used where "vector field" would be more appropriate.

Yes, sure, we will change this.

>It seems as if this class would benefit from having a small template for a generic tensor class. Right now, many of the member functions return tensors as lists (which is fine), but there are also member functions which take an optional argument to return only one component of that tensor. This code then needs to check whether the optional argument is valid, adding some complexity to the code. Maybe we could define a simple tensor class which just has `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` and then let this class deal with components, input checking, etc.

Also agree.  
> I think that some of the functions in the vector_functions module have Sage alternatives, which should be used instead.

It is interesting, I could not find these alternatives, maybe because I do not know Sage well enough. If such alternatives exist, surely we need to use them.

>We need to think on providing an interface to parametric_plot3d, so that these kind of surfaces can easily be plotted.

I also had this idea, for example for plotting vector fields along the surface (see examples in the worksheet). However, I decided to use Unix way: small programs from which the user organizes something like a pipe to get the result. The reason is that it is easier to tune small stones, than to handle big rocks :) May be I am wrong, we should think about this possibility: an interface to plotting routines.  

> Caching the result of computing the fundamental forms, the Christoffel symbols, etc. This would make subsequent calls to the components of these tensors much faster, at the expense of some memory.

Sometimes, it is needed to find one Christoffel symbol, or a coordinate of a metric tensor (we should take into account the fact that calculations in differential geometry may be very very long). So, from my point of view, it possible to use two approaches (as it was done in Maxima). If a user needs all the information on the surface in order to solve some problem, the class calculates everything (first and second fundamental forms, curvatures, etc) and caches it. But also user may say that he needs only one thing, then the class returns exactly the required object.   

>The numerical routines should be optimized for float operations using fast_float or similar. 

Completely agree, we should do it.

To Andrei:
Wiki, it is a good idea, thank you! I will look how to do it, and surely this is the decision.

>It may be useful to consider creating some classes for "generic manifolds" and then specialize them to curves and surfaces. This can be useful to ensure uniform interface in the future and have a possibility right from the start to put "generic methods" into appropriate places. 

Certainly, there are such methods, for example, find Christoffel symbols of a metric,  find a geodesic, etc. which can be included in the more general class of Riemannian manifold. 

I submitted a request to join the group Sage-devel, but there is no response up to now. When I manage to join, I will post the information in this group as well.

I've been a little busy over the last few days, but I made some changes to the patch which I wanted to show you.  The new patch is attached to this comment.

The most significant is that I think that the member functions such as `natural_frame`, `first_fundamental_form_coefficients`, `second_order_natural_frame`, etc. should always just return a dictionary/list with all of the components.  The current situation is that these functions take an optional argument, and when that argument is specified only that component is returned.  

1. By returning a dictionary/list we avoid having to check whether the index is in the appropriate range.  
2. We also avoid code duplication (now there is often the same code, once to compute all the coefficients at once and once to compute individual components);
3. It is slightly counter intuitive to have a function (say) `natural_frame` return a vector rather than a basis.  If the user is only interested in one component, they can still write 

```
  sage: surface = ParametrizedCurve3D(...)
  sage: f = surface.natural_frame()
  sage: print f[0]
```
1. For the functions like `natural_frame` that return a frame, it would be more in line with current Sage code (see for instance the `basis` member function for vector spaces) to return a full frame as a list.   

However, as I'm proposing a fairly large change, I wanted to ask your opinion before going ahead.  Just to see what would happen, though, I made the changes listed above and it doesn't break anything -- the code as-is doesn't rely on computing the individual components of all those tensors.

Joris, 

I really appreciate that you participate actively in the development of the package.
Thank you very much, I am sure that together we will go much faster and efficiently.
These days I also had a lot of work, but hope at the weekend I will have time to try new version of the package you submitted. 

One thing I should say concerning your idea: 
"The most significant is that I think that the member functions such as natural_frame, first_fundamental_form_coefficients, second_order_natural_frame, etc. should always just return a dictionary/list with all of the components. The current situation is that these functions take an optional argument, and when that argument is specified only that component is returned."
Certainly I agree that this change simplifies code and goes "along the Sage line".
However, my experience in calculations in differential geometry (by hand and using a computer programs), is that often the calculations are really hard (imagine that we deal with a surface whose equations are given by special functions or something else of this type rather than elementary surfaces like the ellipsoid, the catenoid, etc.
In addition, in my opinion, computer calculations are to be combined with some theoretical arguments, calculation by hand, etc. So, it is very real the situation when the user needs to calculate only one component of a tensor and does not need to spend time on the calculation of the whole thing. 
At the same time, another user may wish to have the complete information, because he needs it for some reasons. 
The way out of this contradiction is, I think, to have two algorithms within one package. One is to calculate everything and to cash it, and then use. 
Another is to calculate one thing on user's request (then in order to find other, e.g. components of a tensor, he will spend more time than if he would use the first algorithm, but it is his choice :). 

Maybe you have other solutions which are more efficient than this one. 

Anyway, at the weekend I plan to play with the improved version of the package you submitted here, and will comment on it. 

Again thank you, it is more interesting to work together!

Mikhail

Joris,

I carefully read the last version of the class you uploaded (the new version of patch_v2), and insert my comments. I uploaded this file, there are no changes in the code, only comments. 
I looked how it works, and see that the changes you did improved the class much, especially the speed of calculation. And, of course, the code you wrote is much more professional than mine, so I can learn from it how to do such things.
In part, I find very interesting how you deal the with calculation of first_fundamental_form, etc, and think that it is the best way to calculate the components of tensors, connection coefficients, and other objects of this type. 

I think that now we can do the following things:
1) apply cache_method throughout the class everywhere we can, in part, for calculating the connection coefficients.
2) rewrite the parallel transport method as you did for geodesics
3) improve the method for finding principal curvatures
4) test the class on a wider variety of surfaces

And after that I suppose we can submit the class to Sage.

Hi Mikhail,

Thanks for your comments.  I agree with the outline of the necessary work, and I've gone ahead removing the old version of the methods and checking whether the code still works with Sage 4.6 (it does).  I've also made a start on caching the remaining methods (I worked on `natural_frame`) and the numerical treatment of parallel transport.

With parallel transport, I noticed something weird: as a test, I asked the code to do parallel transport along a great circle on the sphere, and I found that the numerical equations blow up!  I can't see any theoretical reason why this should be a difficult numerical problem, and the code seems fine too.  So I'm a bit puzzled...

As for the remaining issues, I don't know how to deal with the assumption in the computation of the mean curvature, but I'll look at it again during the weekend.

I agree that it would be good to deal with a greater variety of surfaces.  I wanted to implement Costa's surface (just as a preliminary test), but I didn't know how to deal with the Weierstrass p-functions in the parametric representation...

Hi Joris,

The "blow up" was caused apparently by a small mistake in _create_pt_ode_system, see the comments in the parametric_surface3d.py. 
Also this problem appears if the curve goes out the coordinate system (see the worksheet parallel_translation).

Now I will try to do something on calculation of the principal curvatures.
Also, maybe I will manage to do the example of the surface you wrote about.

Mikhail

Yes!  You are quite right about the bug (which I must have introduced while making the code into a patch the first time).  I was worried about the fact that parallel transport did not seem to preserve lengths, but then I falsely convinced myself that was due to the fact that maybe the curves used weren't parametrized by arc length.  I'm quite glad to see that this is solved now.

The problem with the code that I wrote is the following: when writing

```
        C_1 = self.connection_coefficients()
        for coef in C_1:
            C_1[coef] = C_1[coef].subs({u1: curve[0], u2: curve[1]})
```
`C_1` will just be a reference to the connection coefficients dictionary, and not a genuine copy.  So when we change it on the next lines, we are in fact changing the global dictionary of connection coefficients.  Changing the first line to 

```
        C_1 = self.connection_coefficients().copy()
```
also fixes the problem.

I have deleted the old version of the code and uploaded a new version of the patch.  Apart from a few changes here and there, I think the code is in great shape!  If I have time this week, I will work on writing some doc tests for the new methods.

I noticed from the worksheet that your version of the code is in a .py file in your home directory -- are you familiar with applying patches through the hg version control system?  I'm just asking since this would be a good way of coordinating our work if we work on different areas in the file.

Are you sure?  In the code (the latest patch), it appears that the `connection_coefficients` return value is constructed as a new dictionary each time the function is called.

Hi Jason,

I think the problem is that when the method is cached, changing the return value will change the cached copy, and hence when the method is called again, this modified copy will be returned, e.g,  

```
from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method

class A:
	@cached_method
	def get_dict(self):
		return {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}


a = A()
d = a.get_dict()

print d 
d[3] = 'something else'
print a.get_dict()
```
prints

```
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'something else'}
```
instead of two copies of the same.

I don't really get why this would cause the problems in `_create_pt_ode_system`, but addressing it does seem to solve the problem...

Hi Joris,

I played a little this weekend with the class and find that it works sufficiently stable and fast (see the worksheet I upload). Also I added two methods: shape_operator_coefficients and shape operator: sometimes it is needed :) So I think that now it generally is ready for usage by other people. 
Now we need to clean the file from commentaries and change the documentation strings so that they correspond to the methods in their present state.
What do you think: have we almost done the job with parametrized surfaces?

So if I want to check this out, do I just apply the patch:

trac_10132_diff_geom_sage_doctests.patch   

?

Or are there other required pieces?

Thanks,
Marshall

Hi Marshall, 

Yes, this is the right version.  Keep in mind that half of the doctests still aren't updated though (but the functionality is there).

While going over the code, I had the following questions:

1.  Doctesting takes about 1 min. on my Macbook.   Is this acceptable, or too long?
2.  Now that we have a method to compute the shape operator, why not compute the principal curvatures and directions as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the shape operator?  The implementation would be simplified and made more robust this way.  I've added a method ``principal_directions_new`` to illustrate this.

I also made some small changes to some methods (e.g. to ``connection_coefficient``) to make the implementation more readable, but nothing major.

The biggest work will now be in polishing the HTML documentation.  If you do 

```sh
$ cd SAGE_ROOT
$ ./sage -b
$ ./sage -docbuild reference html -j
```
the docs should be built, and the output will be in ``SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/``.

Hi Joris,

Then I applied the patch trac_10132_differential_geometry_sage_v3.2.patch and made "./sage -b", this does not report any errors, the files appeared at their places, and it generally works, though there is a mistake in calculating second fundamental form coefficients, because of two methods of finding second order natural frame.
Then I applied the patch trac_10132_diff_geom_sage_doctests.patch, and got mistakes, something went wrong.
I think it may be because you in fact use some new version of patch. So,

1) can you, please, submit the version of patch you use now?
Just now I did not make any change in parametrized_surface3d, to avoid a situation, when we make changes in different files, and after that it will be hard to make the final version with all the changes.
2) if then I make some changes in the file parametrized_surface3d.py, how can I make the patch for sage? I mean the patch which can be understood by the method hg_sage.apply()?

Hi Mikhail,

Sorry for the late reply -- I too was at a conference, and then I had to grade the exams for my class.

As for the problems with the patch, I think this is due to the fact that you applied both patches simultaneously.  Normally, if you start from a clean Sage install, you can just apply  `trac_10132_diff_geom_sage_doctests.patch` and this should have all the changes and build without problems (tested in Sage 4.6).

In general, I find it easier to work with Mercurial queues (see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#being-more-efficient-mercurial-queues).  After setting up the queue system, you can then apply and unapply patches by simply typing `hg qpush` and `hg qpop`.  

Just as an illustration, after setting up hg, here is how I would apply the differential geometry patch: in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`, do

```
hg qnew [name that I want to use for myself]
patch -p1 [path to the patch]
```

This imports the patch. Doing `./sage -b` then rebuilds the system.  After making changes I would then do the following to create a new patch:

```
hg qrefresh
hg export tip > [path to the new patch]
```

While making changes, you can do `hg status` to see which files have been modified.  If you're not happy with the patch or if you want to put development aside while working on something else, you can do `hg qpop` to temporarily put the patch aside.  `hg qpush`` then restores the patch (but in each case do `./sage -b` to rebuild the system).

I hope this helps -- please let me know if you have further questions!

2) I agree that we can compute the principal curvatures and the principal directions via the shape operator, in fact you are right, in this way we can deal with the case of the equal principal curvatures.

There are two problems: in the file doc/references/index.rst it seems there is no line

In the file sage/all.py there is no line

However, I made the changes from the patch by hand, then ./sage -b and it works fine. I checked the worksheet on the ellipsoid, everything including geodesics, works well. 
So I will proceed to check everything carefully and to complete the work. After that I will submit the result :)

Hello,

That's nice to see some Riemannian geometry to come in ! Before I'm playing with the patch and be involved into details, I have some general preliminary remarks

0) The description of this patch (on this webpage) should contains few words about what you intend to developp. I wrote few lines of description that you can modify.

1) **patch errors**
* the patch trac_10123_final_allfiles_done.patch does not contain the modification of "setup.py" which is needed to take into account modification of Sage sources
* I get a minor error for patching index.rst in the doc with sage-4.6.2

2) **name logic**
* There is a directory sage/geometry/ which is the directory intended for... geometry. It would be better to put all Riemannian geometry inside.
* "riemann" is a very ambiguous name as there is the Riemaniann geometry which deals with manifolds with metric, Riemann surface which are complex curves, Riemann hypothesis, ... perhaps riemannian_manifolds (repository are always plural) is safer and more comprehensive.
* the vector (resp. matrix) manipulation for simplifications of coordinates should be put elsewhere because it has nothing to do with riemannian geometry. The ideal way to do is to implement a new class for vectors on symbolic ring (look at the repertory sage/modules). But that job is a patch in its own. The simplest way I see is that you move this file as sage/modules/vector_symbolic_ring.py and inside its preambule write a word about your needs (ie simplification of coordinates) and make an explicit link to your file. That way, when somebody else comes in to implement the class for vector on symbolic rings he will modify your functions on Riemannian manifolds accordingly.

3) **about a class for generic manifolds:** I do not think the class GenericManifold would be interesting. If anyway you intend to add it, it should be put in another file in another place. If you start such generic stuff, your ParametrizedSurface3D should derive from something like EmbeddedRiemannianManifold. And if so, you have to implement a class for morphisms between RiemannianManifolds... it will be painful !

4) In your file you mention "PatchOfCoordinates" without any reference to the corresponding file ! I think it would be very useful to use it right now in order to be able to have a parametrization defined on a restricted domain... In a soon future it can be used to write differential equations on the surface itself.

Bonjour Vincent,

Thanks a lot for your comments, which are very accurate and helpful, and thanks for acting as a reviewer!  Sorry also for the long delay in answering.

I agree with the suggestions that you made, and I am currently preparing a new version of the patch.  In particular, I agree that the symbolic vector functionality should be moved out of the geometry class.  This feels like a big change, however, so maybe this should have its own ticket?  Please let me know what you prefer.

I need a few more days to clean up the code, and I will post an updated patch shortly.

With best wishes,
Joris

I removed the simplification code for vectors and matrices, moved the files to a subfolder of `sage.geometry` and smoothed out some parts of the code.  Doctests seem to pass and the documentation builds cleanly.

I've simplified some of the methods and updated the documentation to be more verbose.  I think this addresses all of Vincent's suggestions: especially the vector simplification patches have made their way into Sage by now, and it turns out that we didn't need the matrix simplification routines, so I've simply removed them.  

As far as code and documentation goes, the patch is now fairly stable.  Comments welcome, and if anybody is willing to play around with the patch, that would be great!

I just found that sympy (which is a Sage spkg) has a module for tensor calculus in a geometric context :
http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.1/modules/galgebra/GA/GAsympy.html

I do not claim that it should be used in some places, I just put a reference for future reviews.

Hello,

Sorry for the (very) long delay between the first and the second review.

1) I was not able to build the documentation. Launching "sage -docbuild reference html" gives me an error saying that riemannian_manifols is not found (on sage-5.0.beta7). More precisely,  I get "WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/geometry/riemannian_manifolds/parametrized_surface3d"
Then the file for parametrized surfaces is not available in the reference manual. Does it work for you ?

2) In order to make it more user friendly I suggest to add some predefined surfaces that may be accessible like in the following example

```
sage: surfaces.Sphere(center=(0,0,0), radius=2))
...
```
A non exhaustive list of constructor would be: sphere, torus, cylinder, ellipsoid, revolution (for surface of revolution). This will simplify the whole documentation as the examples may be built from those constructor. You may take a look at graphs which allow such feature

```
sage: graphs.CycleGraph(4) 
Cycle graph: Graph on 4 vertices
```
Depending on your feeling, it's possible to put this in another ticket (that I can do).

3) You do use a lot of cached_method that are sometimes redundant. As an example first_fundamental_form_coefficients and _compute_first_fundamental_form_coefficient are two cached function. But the first one only calls the latter for different values. This remark also applies to second_fundamental_form_coefficients.

4) The most interesting part of your patch is the numerical integration for geodesic and parallel transport. But, you did not put any funny example! It would be interesting to have a plotted example of geodesic (on the sphere, ...) and parallel transport (along a loop on a cone, along two paths joinging the same points on the sphere, ...)

Anyway, the patch is very nice.
More to come,
Vincent

Hello,

I hope we will have this patch soonly integrated into Sage.


0) The patch does not apply anymore on sage-5.11.beta3 because conf.py for the documentation has been modified (the list is now automatically built). You can simply remove your modifications to that file. But your file is still not linked in the reference manual, modify the file 'doc/en/reference/geometry/index.rst' accordingly.


1) Many tests fail on my computer because of the random (?) order of terms in a symbolic expression. Here is an example

```
File "parametrized_surface3d.py", line 79, in sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds.parametrized_surface3d.ParametrizedSurface3D
Failed example:
    ellipsoid = ParametrizedSurface3D(ellipsoid_eq, coords, 'ellipsoid'); ellipsoid
Expected:
    Parametrized surface ('ellipsoid') with equation (cos(u1)*cos(u2), 2*sin(u1)*cos(u2), 3*sin(u2))
Got:
    Parametrized surface ('ellipsoid') with equation (cos(u1)*cos(u2), 2*cos(u2)*sin(u1), 3*sin(u2))
```


2) in all.py instead of using `import` you should use `lazy_import` as follows

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds.parametrized_surface3d', 'ParametrizedSurface3D')
lazy_import('sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds.surface3d_generators', 'surfaces')
```
The advantage is that it does not affect Sage startup time.


3) You use the old framework for errors (which will not be compatible with Python 3), just replace

```
raise ValueError, "my error message"
```
by

```
raise ValueError("my error message")
```


4) In the surface generator, because `self` is never invoked in the core of the method it is better to use the decorator `@`staticmethod (see [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#staticmethod)). You only need to replace

```
    def my_generator(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        # bla
```     
by

```     
    @staticmethod
    def my_generator(arg1, arg2, ...)
        # bla
```


5) Both attributes `index_list` and `index_list_3` are *never* modified by your program nor used very often. I think it would be better to remove them. For iteration, you can use 

```
sage: from itertools import product
sage: for i,j,k in product((1,2),repeat=3):
....:    print i,j,k
1 1 1
1 1 2
...
2 2 2
```
and for containance test

```
sage: t = (1,3,2)
sage: len(t) == 3 and all(i == 1 or i == 2 or i == 3 for i in t)
True
```


6) I was not able to build a point in the parametrization. Let say I use the torus surfaces.Torus(), how do I obtain the coordinates (in `R^3`) of the point with u=.3 and v=.5 ? It is possible through T.eq_callable but then the name is bad (I was obliged to read the code to find it!) and it has no documentation. In the same veine, given (u,v) and a vector x in `R^2` how do I get the corresponding tangent vector on the surface ?


7) Do you agree to add this example in the doc ?

```
sage: S = surfaces.Sphere()
sage: g1 = [c[-1] for c in S.geodesics_numerical((0,0),(1,0),(0,2*pi,100))]
sage: g2 = [c[-1] for c in S.geodesics_numerical((0,0),(cos(pi/3),sin(pi/3)),(0,2*pi,100))]
sage: g3 = [c[-1] for c in S.geodesics_numerical((0,0),(cos(2*pi/3),sin(2*pi/3)),(0,2*pi,100))]
sage: (S.plot(opacity=0.3) + line3d(g1,color='red') + line3d(g2,color='red') + line3d(g3,color='red')).show()
```
Actually it would be nice to also add some tangent vectors to that picture.

Hi Vincent, 

Thanks a lot for your swift and incisive comments, which have improved the code a lot! I've implemented all of them, but I noticed that #12737 breaks some of the doctests in this patch, and I'm currently updating the code to take that into account. I should have something ready by the end of the weekend, though.

I haven't included the files in 'geometry/index.rst' as that file seems to deal with combinatorial geometry mostly. Instead, I've linked from the front page of the documentation, and I've put an entry under 'geometry and topology'.

I think this is a consequence of some changes in the behavior of multivariate symbolic expressions: I used to have no problems like this for the 3 years that I've been testing this patch, but with a reasonably recent version of Sage I see the same problems that you notice.

I've added methods `point` and `tangent_vector`, which do what you suggested. Adding these methods also had the advantage of making the implementation somewhat clearer: I've now removed `eq_callable` (which was not very clear to begin with) and replaced its invocation with calls to the method `point()`.

This is a very nice and illustrative example; I've added it to the class documentation.

Some other changes that I've made include anticipating #12737, which removes `simplify_radical` from `simplify_full`. I found that we actually rely on `simplify_radical` a lot, among other things to get rid of expressions like `sqrt(x^2)/x' for `x > 0'. I've implemented a small helper function to call both simplification methods successively. For the rest, I've also made tons of little changes to the doctests.

Let me know if you need more information.

Hi,

Sorry for the long time between the reviews. I think that the patch is ready to go and has wait too much. The patch applies on 5.12.rc0 and test succeded.

I just leave further remarks for next improvement

1) I found that you use way too much cached_method (12 occurrences). Their usage is expensive precisely because they cache the result. It should be use only in time critical part of the code. I would suppress it from: rotation, _create_geodesic_ode_system.

2) the code here is in its most part compatible with sage-manifolds (#14865). There should be a merge at some point. Sage manifolds allows to have multiple charts and hence to have more embedded surfaces!

I also ask you to rebase the patch to a more recent version of Sage, as there is some fuzz when applying the patch.

This could very well be a bug in Tachyon, but it's strange that no other 3D plots fail doctests like this.

shows a lot of `nan` values, perhaps this is the problem.
