PIL fails to find optional (system) libraries on Linux systems where e.g. `/usr/lib64` is **not** a symbolic link to `/usr/lib`. This is the case on e.g. 64-bit Fedora, CentOS and openSUSE systems.

Well, neither this nor the ticket / spkg it is based on has a formal positive review yet, but I won't object to including it...

Are you ok with the "two-phase" `patch`? (Don't remove the GNU patch spkg from the alpha then!)

I would not do any of this on Solaris. The run-time linker should take the library from the correct directory, based on whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit. It would be 

`/lib/`isainfo -n`/`

where for all modern machines, `isainfo -n` will return either `sparcv9` or `amd64`

Is there some equivalent of `isainfo -n` which exists on Linux, and so one would not have code that is depends on the distribution?

And I wouldn't mess around with `SAGE64` and dumb flag files on operating systems that don't need it (which is solely for *your* and John P.'s convenience if you forget to set it on your preferred OSs).


I don't know what you mean by *"any of" this*, but:

*Does this change break anything on Solaris or other OSs?* No.

*Is this change a regression on Solaris or other OSs?* No.


So if you want to do similar on Solaris (e.g. adding `.../lib/64` dirs if appropriate), please read the (Python!) code, our [comment:ticket:9864:38 previous answers], and open another ticket for that.

I have no problems with that.  It's nice to see the `patch` package used like this!  As far as I know, there hasn't been a single problem with `patch`, so I don't plan to unmerge it.

Unfortunately<sup>TM</sup>, upstream might not consider this a problem, since (I think) usually PIL would find those libraries - if installed - where (a system-wide) Python was installed, though not necessarily (regarding the `lib64` issue).

> That being said, the band-aid of having a better hard-coded directory is probably the best we can do until upstream fixes their broken `setup.py`. 


The latest, 1.1.7, isn't much better.

(And I think they won't accept our `if SAGE_BINARY_BUILD = "yes"` fixes... ;-) )

It also has

```python
...
# Library pointers.
#
# Use None to look for the libraries in well-known library locations.
# Use a string to specify a single directory, for both the library and
# the include files.  Use a tuple to specify separate directories:
# (libpath, includepath).  Examples:
#
# JPEG_ROOT = "/home/libraries/jpeg-6b"
# TIFF_ROOT = "/opt/tiff/lib", "/opt/tiff/include"
#
# If you have "lib" and "include" directories under a common parent,
# you can use the "libinclude" helper:
#
# TIFF_ROOT = libinclude("/opt/tiff")

...

# Override settings

try:
    from setup_site import *
except ImportError:
    pass
```
so one could provide such a file giving the exact locations. One could even create it in `spkg-install`, and / or create symbolic links in `SAGE_LOCAL/{include,lib}`.


Btw, `isainfo` on Solaris only tells us what *the kernel* is built for or supports, not if Sage or Sage's Python was built 32- or 64-bit.

As an incremental step towards a working PIL, the bandaid in this patch is fine.

For the record, I tested that the jpeg plugin works with:

```
sage: import Image
sage: im = Image.open("image.jpg")
sage: print im.format, im.size
JPEG (1600, 900)
```
and 

```
[vbraun@localhost sage]$ ldd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PIL/_imaging.so | grep libjpeg
	libjpeg.so.62 => /usr/lib64/libjpeg.so.62 (0x00007fc3b38ea000)
```

Leif, we should still report it upstream. Yes they might not care that their package is broken on everything but Debian, but then they might and at least there will be a paper trail to this ticket. Since you wrote the patch, I think you should have the honours :-)
