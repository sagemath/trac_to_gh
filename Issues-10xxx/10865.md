The hash \"#\" followed by a space is Mercurial's magic pattern for delimiting a comment. For example:\n\n```\n[mvngu@sage sage-4.7.alpha4]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/10865/trac-10865_copyright-README.patch && hg qpush \nadding trac-10865_copyright-README.patch to series file\napplying trac-10865_copyright-README.patch\nnow at: trac-10865_copyright-README.patch\n[mvngu@sage sage-4.7.alpha4]$ hg tip\nchangeset:   10:1f2ac1797126\ntag:         qtip\ntag:         tip\ntag:         trac-10865_copyright-README.patch\ntag:         qbase\nuser:        Mariah Lenox <mariah.lenox@gmail.com>\ndate:        Tue Apr 12 14:43:13 2011 -0400\nsummary:     imported patch trac-10865_copyright-README.patch\n```\nThus the content for the \"summary:\" line should be\n\n```\nsummary:     Trac 10865: update copyright years to include 2011\n```\ninstead of\n\n```\nsummary:     imported patch trac-10865_copyright-README.patch\n```\nTo rectify the situation, simply remove the string \"# \".\n\n\n\n\n\n> I can give [attachment:trac-10865_copyright-doc.patch]\n> a positive review.

You have `sage/ext/mac-app/Sage-Info.plist` when I believe you mean `data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage-Info.plist`\n\n\nThe given path is wrong if you apply the patch from `SAGE_ROOT`. Note that `SAGE_ROOT` was recently put under revision control, whereas `data/extcode` has been under revision control for many years now. During that time, `data/extcode` was and still is its own Mercurial repository, separate from everything else that is under revision control. So to apply a patch to `data/extcode`, you would need to do\n\n```\n$ cd data/extcode\n```\nand then apply the patch.

# Trac 10865: update copyright years to include 2011
```
This would be interpreted by Mercurial as a comment on a patch file, and not as a commit message as you intended. The hash "#" followed by a space is Mercurial's magic pattern for delimiting a comment. For example:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.7.alpha4]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/10865/trac-10865_copyright-README.patch && hg qpush 
adding trac-10865_copyright-README.patch to series file
applying trac-10865_copyright-README.patch
now at: trac-10865_copyright-README.patch
[mvngu@sage sage-4.7.alpha4]$ hg tip
changeset:   10:1f2ac1797126
tag:         qtip
tag:         tip
tag:         trac-10865_copyright-README.patch

date:        Tue Apr 12 14:43:13 2011 -0400
summary:     imported patch trac-10865_copyright-README.patch
```
Thus the content for the "summary:" line should be

```
summary:     Trac 10865: update copyright years to include 2011
```
instead of

```
summary:     imported patch trac-10865_copyright-README.patch
```
To rectify the situation, simply remove the string "# ".

The given path is wrong if you apply the patch from `SAGE_ROOT`. Note that `SAGE_ROOT` was recently put under revision control, whereas `data/extcode` has been under revision control for many years now. During that time, `data/extcode` was and still is its own Mercurial repository, separate from everything else that is under revision control. So to apply a patch to `data/extcode`, you would need to do

```
$ cd data/extcode
```
and then apply the patch. Here's an illustration:
