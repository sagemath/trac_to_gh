```
There are already some functions in Sage dealing with the periods of a word, namely 

1. `is_primitive(self)`, tells whether self is an integral power of another smaller word;
2. `primitive(self)`, returns the smallest word `u` such that `self = u^n` and `n` is an integer;
3. `primitive_length(self)`, returns the length of the primitive of self.

However, the two following functions are useful and should be added:

1. `has_period(self, p)`, which returns True if `p` is a period of `self`;
2. `periods(self)`, returns all the periods of `self`.

I should upload a patch soon with those two functions.

Right. The line `NOTE:` should be replaced by `.. NOTE::` and the following paragraph should be indented.
