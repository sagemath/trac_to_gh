```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('2082a1')
sage: [P[0] for P in E.integral_points()]
[-11, -2, 4, 13]
```
but

```
sage: E.lift_x(507525709)
(507525709 : 11433453531221 : 1)
```
so we miss one point.  Note that this point is 13*P where P is the generator, and our code computes the bound to be 12.

John Cannon is sending me a complete list of integral points for all curves in the Cremona database, computed using Magma, using some recent enhancements.  Previously I had checked that Sage and Magma agreed to conductor 10000, so their enhancements must also fix bugs.

Here is a list of curves and integral x-coordinates not found by Sage, as provided by John Cannon.  It is not necessarily complete, but is a minimal set of test cases for any patch fixing this.
