I can define this function in a xterm or in a emacs buffer linked to the sage shell buffer.

I get an error when I type it in the *Sage Inferior* mode.

```
def test (n) :
  if n==2 :
    return 2
  else :
    return 3
```
In emacs I get the error around the "else :" line

```
------------------------------------------------
  File "<ipython console>", line 4
    se :
      ^^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage:     return 3

-----------------------------------------------------
  File "<ipython console>", line 1
SyntaxError: 'return' outside function (<ipython console>, line 1)
```

This error isn't in the sage*.el mode because I get the same problem in any shell buffer that I run with [Alt-x] shell [return] sage [return].

FWIW typing it in without indenting works:

```

sage: def test(n) :
....: if n==2 :
....: return 2
....: else :
....: return 3
....: 
sage: test(2)
2
```

But indenting it "manually" causes problems:

```
def test (n) :
....:   if n==2 :
....:     return 2
....:   else :
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 4
     se :
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

In a shell, the proper indentation is added automatically i.e. the transcript below resulted from typing exactly the same characters as the first:

```
sage: def test(n) :
....:     if n==2:
....:         return 2
....:     else:
....:         return 3
....:     
sage: test(3)
3
```

It's probably related to the TERM environment variable (set to "dumb" inside emacs), but I don't know where this is handled in Sage (probably ipython).

This can be done by adding to `main()` in `ipy_user_conf.py`:

```

    import os
    if os.environ['TERM'] == 'dumb':
        o.autoindent = 0
```

I plan to wait until after #12167 to fix this.
