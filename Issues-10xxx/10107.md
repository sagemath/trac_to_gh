This patch has `from sage.misc.misc import sage_wraps ` while the patch at #9907 moves `sage_wraps` from `sage.misc.misc` to `sage.misc.decorators`.

Yes, most of the patch is to deprecate using those functions from the top level before removing them.  Since this shared some functionality with preexisting code, the idea was to unify the code.
