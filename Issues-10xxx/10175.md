Just a couple comments:

* You need to raise the `NotImplementedError` on line 281, and there are a couple other points in the file where this same mistake is made.

* In the documentation of __mul__, you only allow multiplication by an integer.  But you can in fact multiply by other scalars that coerce into Gap: number field elements for example.

Other than that, I'll run the tests once I build a new copy of Sage on sage.math and fly to Boston.
