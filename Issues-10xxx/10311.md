The following looks like a bug to me, but feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.

```
sage: var('z')
sage: g1 = z^5 - (2 - I)*z^4 - (34 + 13*I)*z^3 + (22 - 51*I)*z^2 \
+ (53 - I)*z - 728 - 196*I == 0
sage:
sage: solve([g1], z)
[0 == z^5 + (I - 2)*z^4 - (13*I + 34)*z^3 - (51*I - 22)*z^2 -
(I - 53)*z - 196*I - 728]
sage:
sage: solve([g1, I == I], z)
[[z == (-4.00420663449 - 1.03443096055*I)], [z == (7.03872088238 +
1.11154206861*I)], [z == (1.40276621 - 2.70758376454*I)], [z == (
-3.78854832152 - 0.122376366114*I)], [z == (1.35126786363 +
1.7528490226*I)]]
sage:
sage: solve([g1, z == z], z)
[[z == (-4.00420663449 - 1.03443096055*I)], [z == (7.03872088238 +
1.11154206861*I)], [z == (1.40276621 - 2.70758376454*I)], [z == (
-3.78854832152 - 0.122376366114*I)], [z == (1.35126786363 +
1.7528490226*I)]]
```

I think the problem is that `solve()` refuses to solve equation systems with more variables than equations, even if some of the variables are already known.
