Consider two manifestly isomorphic graphs:

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0,1), (1,1)])
sage: G.vertices(), G.edges()
([0, 1], [(0, 1, None), (1, 1, None)])
sage: 
sage: G2 = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G2.add_edges([(0,2), (2,2)])
sage: G2.vertices(), G2.edges()
([0, 2], [(0, 2, None), (2, 2, None)])
sage: 
sage: G.is_isomorphic(G2), G2.is_isomorphic(G)
(False, False)
```

This occurs because the isomorphism comparison short-circuits because it notices that

```
sage: G.size()
2
sage: G2.size()
1
```

which is true because

```
sage: G.num_edges()
2
sage: G2.num_edges()
1
```

which I think happens because the following code in c_graph.pyx

```
            if self.loops(None):
                if self.multiple_edges(None):
                    for j in xrange(self.num_verts()):
                        if self.has_edge(j, j, None):
                            k += len(self.get_edge_label(j, j))
                else:
                    for j in xrange(self.num_verts()):
                        if self.has_edge(j, j, None):
                            k += 1
            i = (i - k) / 2
            return i + k
```

assumes that the vertex labels which show up in the edge list go from 0 to num_verts-1.  If I replace "for j in xrange(self.num_verts())" with "for j in self.iterator_verts(None)", things improve:

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0,1), (1,1)])
sage: G.vertices(), G.edges()
([0, 1], [(0, 1, None), (1, 1, None)])
sage: 
sage: G2 = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G2.add_edges([(0,2), (2,2)])
sage: G2.vertices(), G2.edges()
([0, 2], [(0, 2, None), (2, 2, None)])
sage: 
sage: G.size(), G.num_edges()
(2, 2)
sage: G2.size(), G2.num_edges()
(2, 2)
sage: 
sage: G.is_isomorphic(G2), G2.is_isomorphic(G)
(True, True)
```

If someone can verify the above analysis I can work up a patch (the above case appeared when I was writing tests for a prospective patch to fix #10812).

Hello !!

When I type your commands in 4.6.2.alpha3, I get :

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0,1), (1,1)])
sage: G.vertices(), G.edges()
([0, 1], [(0, 1, None), (1, 1, None)])
sage: G2 = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G2.add_edges([(0,2), (2,2)])
sage: G2.vertices(), G2.edges()
([0, 2], [(0, 2, None), (2, 2, None)])
sage: G.is_isomorphic(G2), G2.is_isomorphic(G)
(True, True)
```

I'm pretty sure I reviewed some patch about this very part of the code you're quoting, but unlike the one I mentionned in #10814 I can not find its number back. It was probably one of Robert's.

Anyway, the latest version of Sage and the one the developpers are working on usually corresponds to the latest post of sage-release.

... And Welome aboard `:-)`

Would it be inappropriate to add a doctest for the above problem to is_isomorphic anyway?
