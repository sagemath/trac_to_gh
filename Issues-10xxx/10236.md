The following two computations should yield the same answer. First with the modular symbols in sage

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: m = E.modular_symbol()
sage: m(1/7)
7/10 
sage: m(0)
1/5
```

and then using ec_lib :

```
sage: m = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=True)
sage: m(1/7)
6/5
sage: m(0)
1/5
```

That the actual value of [1/7] must be 7/10 is illustrated be the following

```
sage: ans = E.anlist(10^5)
sage: twopii = CC(2*pi*i)
sage: s = 0
sage: n = 1
sage: while n < 50000:
....:     s += ans[n]/n*exp(twopii*n/7)
....:     n += 1
sage: s.real()/E.period_lattice().basis()[0]
0.694799317284868
```

The fact that both values at 0 are equal show that it is unlikely that this is a problem with the scaling of the modular symbols.

---

Here is another bug. Maybe the same, maybe different. This one looks like being in scaling. But I am puzzled, because this example was used originally in the design of the scaling function.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('121b1')
sage: m = E.modular_symbol()
sage: m(1/7)
2
sage: m._scaling
-2
```

It should in fact be [1/7]+ = 1/2.

```
sage: ans = E.anlist(10^5)
sage: s = 0
sage: n = 1
sage: while n < 100000:
    s += ans[n]/n*exp(twopii*n/7)
    n += 1
....:     
sage: s.real()/E.period_lattice().basis()[0]
0.484665473298495
```

This was originally reported by Andrew Ohana.

One guess might be that I misinterpreted what the output of eclib is. I assumed that in line 553 in ell_modular_symbol.py that the output of 

```
sage: from sage.libs.cremona.newforms import ECModularSymbol
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')

```

meant that 2 pi i \int_{r}^{0} f(z) dz = m(r) * Omega
where f is the modular form and Omega = 1.2692 is the real period. Maybe this is not correct. Then the documentation in sage.libs.cremona.newforms.pyx should be improved.

This second patch, applied after the first one, will solve the both issues in the ticket description and revert back some errors introduced earlier.

The problem was a "/2" in a formula. I have absolutely no idea why I put that there. To check that the formula is now correct, I did the following::

```
sage: rs = flatten([[a/m for a in srange(1,m) if gcd(a,m)==1] for m in srange(2,20)])
sage: for E in cremona_curves([11..100]):
....:     m = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=False)
....:     me = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=True)
....:     for r in rs:
....:         if m(r) != me(r):
....:             print E.label(), r, m(r), me(r)
```

which gladly did not yield any output.

So these patches are ready for review.
