The is_planar method for graphs includes a set_embedding argument that saves the combinatorial embedding of the graph (if it's planar). In this example, it works properly:

sage: g = graphs.WheelGraph(6)
sage: g.is_planar(set_embedding=True)
True
sage: g.get_embedding()
{0: [1, 5, 4, 3, 2], 1: [2, 5, 0], 2: [0, 3, 1], 3: [0, 4, 2], 4: [0, 5, 3], 5: [0, 1, 4]}

However, is we apply this method to a graph with no edges, a problem arises:

sage: g = graphs.EmptyGraph()
sage: g.add_vertices(range(6))
sage: g.is_planar(set_embedding=True)

AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ers/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/public/share/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in is_planar(self, on_embedding, kuratowski, set_embedding, set_pos)
   2438                     self._pos = G._pos
   2439                 if set_embedding:
-> 2440                     self._embedding = G._embedding
   2441             return planar
   2442 

AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute '_embedding'

Once we add an edge to this graph, all is well:

sage: g.add_edge(0,1)
sage: sage: g.is_planar(set_embedding=True)
True
sage: g.get_embedding()
{0: [1], 1: [0], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: []}
