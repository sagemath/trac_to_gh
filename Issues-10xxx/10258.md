Nice!

There are some examples in the documentation that use malloc, for example `doc/en/numerical_sage/ctypes_examples.rst`. We should convert these to `sage_malloc` as well, probably in #10109.

You are right that some documentation uses `malloc`.  But that seems to be pure C code.  So changing `malloc` to `sage_malloc` would imply linking against `-Lcsage` and possibly adding some `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` machinery and possibly more complications...
