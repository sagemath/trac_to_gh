This is not just an issue with cyclotomic linear algebra.  I'm doing some computations of modular symbols spaces of weight 4 with trivial character, and just hit "no previous prime".  We need real 64-bit mod-p linear algebra to fix this issue.  We need more primes!

This turned out to be easier to resolve than it might have otherwise been, since Burcin Erocal and Martin Albrecht had improved matrices modn so they can now handle a modulus up to 2^23.  However, they hadn't adapted the chinese remainder theorem infrastructure to take this into account. 

I've written code that makes it so for dense linear algebra we have all the primes up to 2^23 at our disposal, instead of just the primes up to 46341.    There are more, bigger, and better primes up to 2^23:

```
sage: n = prod(prime_range(46431))
sage: len(str(n))                 
20025
sage: time n = prod(prime_range(2^23))
Time: CPU 0.90 s, Wall: 0.90 s
sage: len(str(n))
3641670

sage: prime_pi(2^23)
564163
sage: prime_pi(46431)
4797
sage: prime_pi(2^23)//prime_pi(46431)
117
```

The upshot is that in various contexts we can deal with answers with up to 3.5 million digits, instead of only 20,025 digits, which was pretty feeble.   Moreover, since the linear algebra is just as fast or faster, and we start with the biggest prime we can, certain linear algebra computations should be much faster with this new code. 

I did *not* fix anything for sparse matrices, except avoiding introducing a major bug (caught by doctests).  See #12679 for sparse matrices, as this should be another ticket.

Also, obviously, this fix is only a partial fix, and we'll someday have to deal with running out of primes on huge problems.  But it'll take around 150 times as long to ever reach such problems, for what it is worth.   

Note that it would probably be trivial to change the *old* matrix_modn_dense code to use 64-bit ints, hence support a modulus up to 2^31. However the new Erocal-Albrecht code can't go beyond 2^23.  So that code -- which they deprecated -- should probably be resurrected.  That's a project for later.

Looks good to me. The only comment I have is that the changes adding

```
cdef extern from "stdint.h": 
    ctypedef unsigned long uint_fast64_t 

cdef extern from "multi_modular.h": 
    ctypedef uint_fast64_t mod_int 
```

are unnecessary, declaring it as an unsigned long in Cython is sufficient.

I tested on 32-bit and it works, but *only* after making a 1-line change to the Linbox spkg (which isn't needed on 64-bit, evidently). 

I've posted the new linbox spkg here:

    http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/linbox-1.1.6.p8.spkg

So to apply this ticket:

1. Build new linbox: http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/linbox-1.1.6.p8.spkg
2. Apply the patch to the sage repo: trac_10281-sage-5.0-beta9.patch

William, do you want to make the change suggested by Robert? Personally, I would keep the extern statements for clearness (they obviously don't do any harm).

If you don't intend to, then I would set this to positive review, so that everything can be run on the build farm.

I did make the changes and updated the second patch.  I didn't bother with the beta2 patch, since that one will never get applied by the release manager.

Please do.  Thanks!

I have to point out that I was running some big modular symbols computations over cyclotomic fields and found some "not enough primes" issues even with this patch.  That's because we only get to use split primes.    So it will be very important to revive the old matrix_modn_dense code, but using a 64-bit int instead of 32-bit, so we get modulo up to `2^32` (instead of `2^23`).  (That is already #4968.)  I plan to do that this week or next week.     The current patch here is very good foundation for doing #4968 right.
