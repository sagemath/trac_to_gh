This is using sage-4.6.1.

It would be nice to have sage -coverage provide doctest statistics for .sage files the way it does for the .py and .pyx files in the sage library.  At the moment this does not work.

It is possible that all that's needed is a trivial change in the coverage script, but I have not checked that.

Apply trac_10674_coverage_for_dot_sage_files.patch to `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`

Keywords: **coverage script**
