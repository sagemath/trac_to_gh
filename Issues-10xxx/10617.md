With the ticket applied,

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = R.random_element(200)
sage: g = R.random_element(200)
sage: %time _ = f(g)
CPU times: user 4.19 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 4.35 s
Wall time: 4.37 s

We also note the change in runtime taken for evaluating a polynomial at an integer.  With a vanilla 4.6.0, 

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = R.random_element(degree=2048, x=2**1024)
sage: a = ZZ.random_element(x = 2**1024)
sage: %time _ = f(a)
CPU times: user 4.35 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 4.35 s
Wall time: 4.36 s
```

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
