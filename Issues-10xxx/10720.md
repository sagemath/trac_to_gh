There is a nth_root method defined on univariate polynomial (via Newton method)

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: ((1 + x - x^2)**5).nth_root(5)
-x^2 + x + 1
```
We provide a more general implementation in a new method `_nth_root_series` that compute the series expansion of the n-th root for univariate polynomials. Using it we implement straightforward `nth_root` for univariate (Laurent) power series.

This branch will not consider support for `extend=True` (see this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ijYyZ4IduF0)). When `extend=True` the method will simply raise a `NotImplementedError` while waiting for Puiseux series in Sage (see #4618).

On multi-variate polynomials there is also a `nth_root` method but which is implemented via factorization (sic)! The multivariate case should just call the univariate case with appropriate variable ordering. This will be dealt with in another ticket.

The nth-root of power series `y = x^n` is computed using
the Newton method for `y = x^-n`

```
x' = (1+1/n)*x - y*x^(n+1)/n
```

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^3
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^-3
sage: p.nth_root(-3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
```


With this patch `nth_root` works also for series on `ZZ`

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 4/3*t^2 + t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2*t + 3/4*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

there is a bug in `sqrt` in this case.

`nth_root` can be used to compute the square root of series which
currently `sqrt` does not support

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: p = 4 + t*x + t^2*y + O(t^3)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2 + 1/4*x*t + (-1/64*x^2 + 1/4*y)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p = 32*t^5 + x*t^6 + y*t^7 + O(t^8)
sage: p.nth_root(5)
2*t + 1/80*x*t^2 + (-1/6400*x^2 + 1/80*y)*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```

`nth-root` iteration formula is division-free, which is convenient in this
case; in this case `sqrt`  could call `nth_root`.


`nth_root` can be used in the multivariate series considered
in ticket #1956 .

With trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_3.patch nth_root is much faster for `n` large

```
sage: S.<t> = QQ[[]]
sage: p = t.exp(30)
sage: %time p1 = p.nth_root(1000)

with the previous version it takes 84s

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
With trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_4.patch 
nth_root and inversion become faster for series on
polynomial rings, when used together with
trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication-alternative.patch
from ticket #10480 (otherwise these functions perform as without the patch).

In the following benchmarks apply
trac_karatsuba_improvements.patch and
trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication-alternative.patch,
trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_2.patch and
trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_3.patch;
in (2) apply also the new patch

```
sage: N = 2
sage: R= PolynomialRing(QQ,N,'x')
sage: x = R.gens()
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: sx = sum(x)
sage: prec = 15
sage: p = (t.exp(prec)).subs({t:t*sx})
sage: %time p1 = p^-1
sage: %time p1 = p.nth_root(2)
```

Inversion benchmark:

```
N  prec  (1)    (2)
2  15    0.06   0.01
3  15    2.1    0.07
4  15    58     0.5
5  15    1440   3.4
```

Square root benchmark:

```
N  prec  (1)    (2)
2  15    0.15   0.03
3  15    5.2    0.31
4  15    161    3.3
```

The speedup is large because the terms with high degree in `t`
are large polynomials, due to the combinatorial
possibilities with several variables; using `_mul_` instead of _mul_trunc
several products involving these large polynomials are computed and
later truncated away.
