There is a nth_root method defined on univariate polynomial (via Newton method)

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: ((1 + x - x^2)**5).nth_root(5)
-x^2 + x + 1
```
We provide a more general implementation in a new method `_nth_root_series` that compute the series expansion of the n-th root for univariate polynomials. Using it we implement straightforward `nth_root` for univariate (Laurent) power series.

This branch will not consider support for `extend=True` (see this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ijYyZ4IduF0)). When `extend=True` the method will simply raise a `NotImplementedError` while waiting for Puiseux series in Sage (see #4618).

On multi-variate polynomials there is also a `nth_root` method but which is implemented via factorization (sic)! The multivariate case should just call the univariate case with appropriate variable ordering. This will be dealt with in another ticket.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The nth-root of power series `y = x^n` is computed using
the Newton method for `y = x^-n`

```
x' = (1+1/n)*x - y*x^(n+1)/n
```

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^3
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^-3
sage: p.nth_root(-3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
```


With this patch `nth_root` works also for series on `ZZ`

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 4/3*t^2 + t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2*t + 3/4*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

there is a bug in `sqrt` in this case.

`nth_root` can be used to compute the square root of series which
currently `sqrt` does not support

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: p = 4 + t*x + t^2*y + O(t^3)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2 + 1/4*x*t + (-1/64*x^2 + 1/4*y)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p = 32*t^5 + x*t^6 + y*t^7 + O(t^8)
sage: p.nth_root(5)
2*t + 1/80*x*t^2 + (-1/6400*x^2 + 1/80*y)*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```

`nth-root` iteration formula is division-free, which is convenient in this
case; in this case `sqrt`  could call `nth_root`.


`nth_root` can be used in the multivariate series considered
in ticket #1956 .

in (2) apply also the new patch

several products involving these large polynomials are computed and
