There is a nth_root method defined on univariate polynomial (via Newton method)

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: ((1 + x - x^2)**5).nth_root(5)
-x^2 + x + 1
```
We provide a more general implementation in a new method `_nth_root_series` that compute the series expansion of the n-th root for univariate polynomials. Using it we implement straightforward `nth_root` for univariate (Laurent) power series.

This branch will not consider support for `extend=True` (see this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ijYyZ4IduF0)). When `extend=True` the method will simply raise a `NotImplementedError` while waiting for Puiseux series in Sage (see #4618).

On multi-variate polynomials there is also a `nth_root` method but which is implemented via factorization (sic)! The multivariate case should just call the univariate case with appropriate variable ordering. This will be dealt with in another ticket.

<a id='comment:3'></a>The nth-root of power series `y = x^n` is computed using

With this patch `nth_root` works also for series on `ZZ`

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]

sage: p.nth_root(2)

2*t + 3/4*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

there is a bug in `sqrt` in this case.

`nth_root` can be used to compute the square root of series which
currently `sqrt` does not support

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: p = 4 + t*x + t^2*y + O(t^3)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2 + 1/4*x*t + (-1/64*x^2 + 1/4*y)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p = 32*t^5 + x*t^6 + y*t^7 + O(t^8)
sage: p.nth_root(5)
2*t + 1/80*x*t^2 + (-1/6400*x^2 + 1/80*y)*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```

`nth-root` iteration formula is division-free, which is convenient in this
case; in this case `sqrt`  could call `nth_root`.


`nth_root` can be used in the multivariate series considered
in ticket #1956 .

With trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_3.patch nth_root is much faster for `n` large

```

sage: p = t.exp(30)
sage: %time p1 = p.nth_root(1000)

<a id='comment:8'></a>With trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_4.patch 
nth_root and inversion become faster for series on
polynomial rings, when used together with
trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication-alternative.patch
from ticket #10480 (otherwise these functions perform as without the patch).

In the following benchmarks apply
trac_karatsuba_improvements.patch and
trac_10480_fast_PowerSeries_poly_multiplication-alternative.patch,
trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_2.patch and
trac_10720_power_series_nth_root_3.patch;
in (2) apply also the new patch

```
sage: N = 2
sage: R= PolynomialRing(QQ,N,'x')
sage: x = R.gens()
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: sx = sum(x)
sage: prec = 15
sage: p = (t.exp(prec)).subs({t:t*sx})
sage: %time p1 = p^-1
sage: %time p1 = p.nth_root(2)
```

Inversion benchmark:

```
N  prec  (1)    (2)
2  15    0.06   0.01
3  15    2.1    0.07
4  15    58     0.5
5  15    1440   3.4
```

Square root benchmark:

```
N  prec  (1)    (2)
2  15    0.15   0.03
3  15    5.2    0.31
4  15    161    3.3
```

The speedup is large because the terms with high degree in `t`
are large polynomials, due to the combinatorial
possibilities with several variables; using _mul_ instead of _mul_trunc
several products involving these large polynomials are computed and
later truncated away.

sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, default_prec=100)
sage: p = (1 + 2*x - x^4)**200
sage: %timeit p1 = p.nth_root(1000)

sage: %timeit p2 = (p.log()/1000).exp()

But the main advantage of the method proposed here is that it works in positive characteristic.
