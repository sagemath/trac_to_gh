There seems to be a bug in the Huffman build algorithm when given a frequency dictionary.

The following example results in a wrong encoding table: Let there be 10 symbols numbered 1,..,10 where number i occurs with probability i/55.
The Huffman table I end up with, manually running the algorithm is something like the following:

```
{ 1: '00000', 2: '00001', 3: '0001', 4: '1000', 5: '1001',
  6: '001', 7: '110', 8: '111', 9: '101', 10: '01' }
```

which has expected length 173/55.

The current Huffman-algorithm returns

```
{1: '1100', 2: '1101', 3: '1110', 4: '1111', 5: '000',
 6: '001', 7: '010', 8: '011', 9: '100', 10: '101'}
```

which has expected length 175/55.

This happens when Sage is fed with a dictionnary where it expects a string.

```
sage: freq = dict([(i,i) for i in range(1,11)])
sage: freq
{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10}

sage: Huffman(freq).encoding_table()
{1: '1100', 2: '1101', 3: '1110', 4: '1111', 5: '000', 6: '001', 7: '010', 8: '011', 9: '100', 10: '101'}

sage: Huffman(table = freq).encoding_table()
{1: '01110', 2: '01111', 3: '0110', 4: '1110', 5: '1111', 6: '010', 7: '100', 8: '101', 9: '110', 10: '00'}
sage: enc = Huffman(table = freq).encoding_table()
sage: sum(map(lambda (x,y): x*len(y),enc.items()))
173
```

This would take half a second to notice if only Sage was returning an error rather than work on a dictionary instead of a string. This patch should avoid this problem in the future `:-)`

Minor: the doctest says " Feeding a dictionary instead of a string:: ", but then feeds it a list of strings, not a dictionary.
And I don't know if this was intended, but the use of isinstance(string,str) rules out the use of unicode strings.

Ok, I see that I used the class in the wrong way :-)

Wouldn't it be more user-friendly to change the Huffman constructor to accept only one unnamed argument, and then treat it according to type, e.g:

```
def __init__(self, source):
  if isinstance(source, string):
     # init by string
  elif isinstance(source, dict):
     # init by dict
  else:
     # give the user an error
```

(Because of deprecation policy, I guess we would need to support the current interface in some way, which would make the code a bit messy, but that will only be for a year)

Hello !

Right. I just thought : "Let's feed it anything but a string"

> And I don't know if this was intended, but the use of isinstance(string,str) rules out the use of unicode strings.

I don't know what an unicode string is, and I will try to find it out immediately. How do you think we should filter it then ?

Hello !!

This is an updated patch in which string has been replaced by basename, and an unique argument is expected by the constructor.

This class being pretty new and not really advertised, perhaps we can do without backward compatibility for once ?.. `:-p`

I mean, this class is perhaps only useful to illustrate what the Huffman algorithm is (slow encoding in Python..), and updating a possibly uncompatible (if it exists somewhere in the world) should not take more than a few seconds `:-)`
