Reported by Mate Soos:

As of Sage 5.5, `Sequence`s of polynomials offers special methods:

```python
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = GF(2)[]
sage: F0 = Sequence(map(lambda f: f.lm(),[a,b,c,d]))
sage: F0.groebner_basis()
[a, b, c, d]
```

However, `Sequence`s of *boolean* polynomials lack these special methods:

```python
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: F0 = Sequence(map(lambda f: f.lm(),[a,b,c,d]))
sage: F0.groebner_basis()
...
AttributeError: 'Sequence_generic' object has no attribute 'groebner_basis'
```
