Python has the convention `x**0 = 1` even for `x=0`. Sage follows this convention in some cases, but raises an error in others. This patch generalizes Python's convention to `sage.structure.element.generic_power_c`, which includes number field elements and matrices. This fixes inconsistent behaviour for matrices and a bug for number fields (see examples below). See also [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/67e53f8e5d5061d2).

Example 1:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4+x+1)
sage: r = [ZZ,QQ,RR,CC,int,float,K]
sage: N = len(r)^2; N
49
sage: for a in r:
....:     for b in r:
....:         try:
....:             if a(0)^b(0) != 1:
....:                 (a,b,a(0)^b(0))
....:                 N = N - 1
....:         except (ArithmeticError, TypeError, AttributeError, RuntimeError) as e:

So in about half of these cases (25/49) we follow Python's convention `0^0=1` and the other half of the time we get an assortment of errors and `NaN`. This patch removes the 10 occurrences of `ArithmeticError` from the list. Other tickets can deal with the other cases.

Example 2:

```
sage: a = Matrix([[1,0],[0,0]]); a
[1 0]
[0 0]
b = Matrix([[0,0],[0,0]]); b
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: a^0
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: b^0
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```
Here Sage finds `a!=0`, and concludes `a^0 = a.parent()(1)`. Note that the lower right entry of `a^0` should be `0^0`, and is `1`.
Next, Sage finds `b==0`, and concludes that `b^0` is illegal. Both the upper left and lower right entry of `b` are the same as the lower right entry of `a`, so the behaviour of `a^0` and `b^0` in Sage is inconsistent: either both should yield an `ArithmeticError` or neither should.
The patch adopts Python's convention so that the output of `b^0` is the 2x2 identity matrix and this example becomes consistent.

Example 3:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3+x+1)
sage: K.relativize(1, 'c')
Number Field in c0 with defining polynomial x^3 + x + 1 over its base field
sage: K.relativize(0, 'c')
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```
This is explained by

```
sage: NumberField(x-1, 'a').power_basis()
[1]
sage: NumberField(x, 'a').power_basis()
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```
And it gets worse: a number field with defining polynomial `x` is part of the output of `K.subfields()`

```
sage: s = K.subfields()
sage: for i in [1,0]:
....:     K.relativize(s[i][1], 'c')
....: 
Number Field in c0 with defining polynomial x - a1 over its base field
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```
This last example is clearly a bug. An automatic consequence of generalizing Python's convention `0^0=1` is that this bug vanishes.

Interestingly, the patch adds no code.
