Relatively often on sage-support, users run into a problem since they mix symbolics and polynomials. Typically, they do

```
sage: z = var('z')
sage: P = QQ[z]
```
and expect that `z` is the generator of `P` - which is of course 
wrong and will soon mean trouble.

I find even worse that one can do

```
sage: QQ[x,gap,singular]
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, Gap, Singular over Rational Field
```
since the variable names are obtained from the string representation of the given objects.

It should be clear that the preferred way of constructing a polynomial (or quotient) ring together with its generators is

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
```

Hence, it is quite amazing that in the documentation one occasionally finds the "wrong" usage

```
sage: x,y,z = var('x y z')
sage: P = QQ[x,y,z]
```

I suggest to deprecate the possibility of providing the variable names by anything but strings (potentially plus an integer, like `PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)`).

With my patch, one has

```
sage: QQ[x,gap,singular]
/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.6/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage Version 4.6.1) Variable name 'x' should be a string, but we obtained <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>.

Just a question - are the changes in symbolics because before the variables might or might not have been strings?

Also, is there an easy way to show what the generator of `P` would have been in the "bad" old case?  I think that's useful to point out, if one is going to make the remarks in the first place.

> Just a question - are the changes in symbolics because before the variables might or might not have been strings?

As much as I know, the changes that I did in symbolics are indeed "replace a variable `v` by `repr(v)` when it is used to define a polynomial ring. 

> Also, is there an easy way to show what the generator of `P` would have been in the "bad" old case?  I think that's useful to point out, if one is going to make the remarks in the first place.  

I am not quite sure what you mean. By "remark", you probably mean

```
In earlier versions of Sage, the names have not necessarily been 
strings. Some users provided a symbolic variable instead of a string, 
and expected that this symbolic variable is the same as the generator 
of the resulting polynomial ring, which is of course not the case. 
This common mistake is now deprecated. 
```

So, you suggest to write something like this:

```
In earlier versions of Sage, the names have not necessarily been 
strings. Some users provided a symbolic variable instead of a string, 
and expected that this symbolic variable is the same as the generator 
of the resulting polynomial ring, which is of course not the case.

The following might be surpising for a user expecting the variable `x`
to be a polynomial::

    sage: P = QQ['x'] # here, some users wrote QQ[x], which is now deprecated
    sage: x == P(x)
    x == x
    sage: type(x == P(x))
    <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
    sage: parent(x+P(x)) == P
    False

```

I am not so convinced that the above text is good. Do you have a better suggesion?

I'm just saying that the "of course is not the case" is not at all "of course" to me.  Current behavior:

```
sage: P = QQ[x]
sage: P.gen()
x
sage: P.gen() == x
x == x
sage: bool(P.gen() == x)
True
sage: P.gen() is x
False
```
So unless you think to do the last thing, that is pretty confusing - they have identical representation methods.  Which is of course why you want to change this, and introduce the deprecation.

So maybe you could say 

```
... resulting polynomial ring.  However, this was not the case; the generator of a polynomial ring is always a polynomial type, not a symbolic expression, so although they have the same representation, they are not the same.  This explains the following warning:

Does that make any sense?

Umm... that might not happen for a little while.   I can do it, though.   But if I'm going to give it a formal review, I have to make sure I check that all those changes involving making things strings really catch what they are supposed to, and I don't have time to do that right now, and then make the reviewer patch, and I am slow on such things... sorry.

Also, I seem to recall there being some discussion about this on sage-devel.  It's enough of a change (particularly since there are doctests which use the old one) that it could inconvenience some heavy users to see the deprecation messages, so if you have a link to that discussion I'd be interested in reading through it.

Upon further reflection, I think that one would have to change a lot more of the doctests where `x` is used.  This is because even though changing things so that they use `SR['x']` instead of `SR[x]` is good, the same potential for confusion remains.   The very first example in the patch provides the opportunity for this:

```
sage: R = SR['x']
sage: f = R([1/sqrt(2), 1/(4*sqrt(2))])
sage: f
1/8*sqrt(2)*x + 1/2*sqrt(2)
sage: type(f)

sage: type(1/8*sqrt(2)*x + 1/2*sqrt(2))

sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(R.gen())
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_dense_field'>
```

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A11):
> Pardon my naivete, why not recreate the symbol as ring element (and discard the symbol) when the user, by using it in a polynomial context, expects it to behave as one?

The following two invocations cannot be distinguished by the code implementing polynomial ring constructions:

```
x,y,z=var('x,y,z'); R = Q[x,y,z]
```

```
R = Q[ SR('x'), SR('y'), SR('z')]
```
Hopefully you'll agree that in the second case there is no justification to try and reach into the global scope to rebind python names that happen to print as the corresponding strings `'x','y','z'`.

But thanks for bumping this ticket. Can we merge it?

Surely, all those `.orig` files are a mistake?

In various places in the library files, you manually call `R[repr(x)]` or `R[str(x)]`. Is that really needed? Maybe in some cases it is justified, but you need to convince me.

Then some details:

```
x, y = 'x', 'y'
```
is confusing, just use `'x'` and `'y'` instead of `x` and `y`.

Replace

```
R = PolynomialRing(GF(2)['x'])
```
by

```
R = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'x')
```

Change

```
from sage.misc.misc import deprecation
...
if do_something_deprecated():
    deprecation(..)
```
to

```
...
if do_something_deprecated():
    from sage.misc.misc import deprecation
    deprecation(..)
```

This example:

```
sage: R.<xx> = QuotientRing(QQ['x'], QQ['x'].ideal(x^2 + 1)); R
```
is still referring to a wild `x` for the ideal generator. The meaning of this code really depends on what `x` happens to be bound to before. I don't see another way than to write this code in multiple steps:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]; R.<xx> = QuotientRing(P, P.ideal(x^2 + 1)); R
```
In fact, if you put that on one line, it's hardly longer anyway. It might be better style to split it, though.

For jdemeyer's comments: search for "str(" in the git diff view. Your uses looked probable at first glance, but you might want to check the context.

From a somewhat quick look, it doesn't seem like it is doing so much what `normalize_names()` is doing. Yes, some of it is there, but it also needs to know of what the input is before proceeding.
