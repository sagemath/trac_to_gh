Here's my first take at adding support for pseudo differential operators.

The algebra of these operators are a convenient framework for the description of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP)hierarchy (this has to do with mathematical physics / integrable systems).

Depends on #10272.

Note: if you test this, or if you want to run sage -t -long, then you should probably also apply no_maxima.patch (which is a terrible hack). See the warning in the file's docstring.
