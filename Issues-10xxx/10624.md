Consider functions

```
def g1():
    r"""
    S \ E
    S \\ E
    S \\\ E
    S \\\\ E
    S \\\\\ E
    S \\\\\\ E
    S \\\\\\\ E
    """
    pass

def g2():
    r"""
    S \ E
    S \\ E
    S \\\ E
    S \\\\ E
    S \\\\\ E
    S \\\\\\ E
    S \\\\\\\ E    
    ``x``
    """
    pass
```
i.e. they have the same docstrings but the second one has a code block (the same happens with math blocks).

When I type g1? in the notebook, I get pretty much the docstring as it is written, except for a couple of extra blank lines on top. When I type g2?, I get

```
S E S E S \ E S \ E S \E S \E S \\ E x
```
on a single line. I don't think that the treatment of slashes should depend on the presence of extra blocks in the docstring.

While removing slashes may be done for "deLaTeXifying" purposes, it is actually done (at least partially) *before* LaTeX processing. The docstring of

```
def g3():
    r"""
    .. MATH::
        
        a \\ b

    .. MATH::
        
        c \\\ d
    """
    pass
```
in the notebook shows a and b on the same line while c and d on different. For HTML documentation the first block works as it should - a and b are on different lines.

This problem came up on #10479 in the math block of `NefPartition?`.

In Sage 5.4.beta1, g3 doesn't look as described here: a and b are on different lines, and the same for c and d. I'm not sure how the triple back slashes are supposed to end up anyway.

For g1 vs. g2: in the case of g2, the docstring appears to be Sphinx markup (because of the backquotes â€” see the function `is_sphinx_markup` in `devel/sagenb/sagenb/misc/sphinxify.py`), so the function `sphinxify` is run on it, so the slashes get modified. I'm not sure what output you expect in this case, by the way; new lines in documentation should not be respected unless they are in a code block.

OK, I think this is what has to be done.

1. `sagenb/sagenb/misc/support.py`

 ```
    if is_sphinx_markup(s):
        try:
            return sphinxify(s)
        except:
            pass
```
 There should be no `if`: try to sphinxify everything for uniform look. Since all functions are required to have examples now, this is happening anyway almost always.

2. `sagenb/sagenb/misc/sphinxiphy.py` 

 ```
    # This is needed for MathJax to work.
    docstring = docstring.replace('\\\\', '\\')
```
 Get rid of this - it interferes with multiline math, there is no explanation why this is needed and it seems to work just fine without. I also suspect this `MathJax` here is an automatic replacement for `jsMath`, which may have had some issues.

3. `SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/Sphinx-1.1.2-py2.7.egg/sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`

 ```
    app.add_config_value('mathjax_inline', [r'\(', r'\)'], 'html')
    app.add_config_value('mathjax_display', [r'\[', r'\]'], 'html')
```
 These are in the end and I think these parentheses have to go or the parsing should not refer to them at all. Otherwise math is wrapped twice: once in span/div with `class="math"` and inside them in parentheses, which I think should indicate math wrapping in "common text".

 I am not sure where this change has to happen and whether it is a bug in Sphinx or Sage.

If someone puts these ideas to actual patches or explains how to do it, I will greatly appreciate it.

I'll try to look into this and related tickets (like #13455) soon. By the way, another possible change: in sage/sage/misc/latex_macros.py, there is the line

```

I wonder if the `replace` part should be deleted.

It seems silly to have a test which is always true, why can't we remove `if` line but keep the `try` block to deal with the absence of Sphinx?

Just deleting wrappers feels wrong as it is likely to become a bug once "the real bug" is fixed... But I have no better solution and documentation has to look good now.

Will try to figure out reviewing on github!

The latest version on github now just deletes the function `is_sphinx_markup` altogether.

I don't think that our proposed changes to sagenb are a good idea anymore. Problems arise when looking at docstrings from other components of Sage; for example, if you do `r.lm?` in the notebook, before the patch [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/97), newlines are respected, so the examples look good. But after the patch, the whole docstring is treated as ReST markup, and so the newlines are ignored and the examples look bad.

So we should keep working on this (at the sagenb github site, not here), but we need to have a better solution about when to use Sphinx and when not to.
