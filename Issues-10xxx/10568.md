sage: set_verbose(2)

verbose 2 (_lmul_) scalar multiplying
verbose 2 (_lmul_) scalar multiplying finished (time = 0.033165)
1240 x 3720 sparse matrix over Rational Field (type 'print m.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: time 2*m

CPU times: user 15.93 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 15.97 s
Wall time: 16.46 s
1240 x 3720 sparse matrix over Rational Field
```

So the newer and faster `_lmul_` is there but for some reason it is not called.

```

Maarten,

Looks real good and is a good thing to get into Sage.  Seems like sparse matrices are often neglected.  I bet there is more like this to be done in other places.  I used just `10568-speedup-QQmatrix-lmul`, which I hope was the right file.  Some comments and suggestions follow.

Rob

* I like the HUGE doctest.  ;-)

* A doctest like the following might be a nice addition - it'd show a multiplier outside the base ring cooperating with the coercion model and doing the right thing.

    ```
    sage: F = FiniteField(3)
    sage: two = F(2)
    sage: A = matrix(ZZ, 3, range(30), sparse=True)
    sage: B = two*A; B
    [0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0]
    [2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2]
    [1 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1]
    sage: B.parent()
    Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 10 sparse matrices over Finite Field of size 3
  ```

* How about an `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` block in the docstring?  Even though these internal methods don't show in tab-completion, you can still view them in the notebook with formatting, so I think the consistent style is a good idea.

* If you name your files as `*.patch` then Trac gives a very nice red-green/leaving-entering view and my local patch viewer (kompare) will do tab-completion on the filename.  ;-)

* I'd imagine the release manager can clear out the two uploads you didn't want?

Yeah, I thought the HUGE doctest was nice to :). It at least shows what is different about this function compared to the function it overwrites. And it makes sure that if someone accidentally replaces this function by something not sparse that the doctest would never complete :).

I don't think the doctest you suggest is a good addition in this particular place, from the reference manual http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coercion.html:

```
If R is the base of S (as in the first example), simply implement
_rmul_ and/or _lmul_ on the Elements of S. In this case r * s gets
handled as s._rmul_(r) and s * r as s._lmul_(r). The argument to
_rmul_ and _lmul_ are guaranteed to be Elements of the base of S (with
coercion happening beforehand if necessary).
```
So the new code has noting to do with coercion. I really think that tests should be performed in the place where the relevant code is. Since there is no coercion happening in this low level `_lmul_` function this should not be tested here.

Input and output block are added and now with .patch extension :

Maarten,

I like my doctests to mash up as much of Sage as possible, and show how different things work together.  But you have a good argument.  And as an underscore method it's not that critical, anyway.

Trac Tip: once somebody comments on a ticket, they get email for life on that one, so no need to add such a person to the cc.

Passes all tests.  Nice contribution!

Rob
