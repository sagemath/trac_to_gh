Now that Pynac will support 'hold' of symbolic expressions, like

```
sage: tan(pi/12,hold=True)
tan(1/12*pi)
```
we might want a 'context' for this.
The ticket enables the following:

```
        sage: tan(1/12*pi)    
        -sqrt(3) + 2
        sage: with hold:
        ....:     tan(1/12*pi)
        ....:     
        tan(1/12*pi)
        
        sage: with hold:
        ....:     sin(0)
        ....:     cos(0)
        ....:     
        sin(0)
        cos(0)
        sage: hold.start()
        sage: sin(0)
        sin(0)
        sage: cos(0)
        cos(0)
        sage: hold.stop()
        sage: sin(0)
        0
```

```
sage: context('hold') # or whatever the usual syntax is for such things - Sage doesn't have any yet
sage: a = tan(pi/12)
sage: a
tan(pi/12)
```
as opposed to evaluating it.

You are going through Maxima because the `simplify...` functions do this. So improve these by replacing Maxima. It has nothing to do with the question of a global hold context.

I think the best strategy is to keep the old functionality but replace doctests in tutorials and introductory docstrings (another ticket). As there will be more such contexts a syntax for multiple settings like `with context(hold, eval_fp, simplify):` seems best.

Note however that the Python directive `with` interactively acts on its content all at once. That is,

```
sage: with hold:
....:     sin(0)
....:     cos(0)
....:     
sin(0)
cos(0)
```
Maybe we should provide `start()/stop()` so people can do

```
sage: mycontext1 = context(...)
sage: mycontext2 = context(...)
sage: with mycontext1:
........
sage: mycontext2.start()
...
sage: mycontext2.stop()
```
