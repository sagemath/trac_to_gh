Now that Pynac will support 'hold' of symbolic expressions, like

```
sage: tan(pi/12,hold=True)
tan(1/12*pi)
```
we might want a 'context' for this.
The ticket enables the following:

```
        sage: tan(1/12*pi)    
        -sqrt(3) + 2
        sage: with hold:
        ....:     tan(1/12*pi)
        ....:     
        tan(1/12*pi)
        
        sage: with hold:
        ....:     sin(0)
        ....:     cos(0)
        ....:     
        sin(0)
        cos(0)
        sage: hold.start()
        sage: sin(0)
        sin(0)
        sage: cos(0)
        cos(0)
        sage: hold.stop()
        sage: sin(0)
        0
```

No, because this is really a followup to another ticket.  I'll cc: Burcin in, though he probably already gets it given the component.  I imagine something like

```
sage: context('hold') # or whatever the usual syntax is for such things - Sage doesn't have any yet
sage: a = tan(pi/12)
sage: a
tan(pi/12)
```
as opposed to evaluating it.

But with such a construction it is not obvious how to simplify 't' without going through Maxima as suggested in [#10034](http://trac.sagemath.org/search/opensearch?q=ticket%3A10034)


```
sage: with hold: 
....:     t = tan(pi/2) 
....: 
sage: t tan(pi/12) 
sage: t.eval() #or t.unhold() or whatever 
-sqrt(3) + 2

You are going through Maxima because the `simplify...` functions do this. So improve these by replacing Maxima. It has nothing to do with the question of a global hold context.

The construction would look like:

```
sage: class hold_class:
....:     def __enter__(self): print('entered')
....:     def __exit__(self, *args): print('exited')
....:     
sage: hold = hold_class()
sage: with hold:
....:     x^2
....:     
entered
x^2
exited
```

sage: with hold:

Maybe we should provide `start()/stop()` so people can do

```
sage: mycontext1 = context(...)
sage: mycontext2 = context(...)
sage: with mycontext1:
........
sage: mycontext2.start()
...
sage: mycontext2.stop()
