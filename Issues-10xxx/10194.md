At Sage days 30, a long brainstorm seems to have finalized the design. Here is a excerpt from the documentation:

A *set factory* `F` is device, whose goal is to construct parent `P`
which models subsets of a big set `S`. Typically, the `P` s are constructed
within families obtained by putting a bunch of constraints `cons` on the
elements of the set `S`. In such a hierarchy of subsets, one needs to have a
fine and easy control on the elements construction. That is, one often needs
that `P` constructs elements in a subclass of its usual class for element. On
the contrary, one also often needs `P` to be a facade parent, meaning that `P`
construct element whose actual parent is not `P` itself.

The role of a set factory is twofold:

- *manage a database* of constructors for the different parents `P = F(cons)`
  depending on the various kinds of constraints `cons`. Note: currently there
  is no real support for that. We are gathering use case before fixing the
  interface.

- ensure that the elements `e = P(...)` created by the different parents
  follows a consistent policy concerning their *class and parent*.

The patch implement this idea while trying to leave as much as possible space 
for further improvement. In particular, I tried to specify the few possible 
things about constraints. I'm even not completely sure about `add_constraints`.
Please comment and review.

There is no patch at #10963. I don't think this can be meaningfully tagged as "needs review" when one of its dependencies doesn't exist yet.

As you can see on #10963, the patch is far for being inexistent as Simon and Christian started to review it. Of course it is on the Sage-Combinat queue. I need to ping Nicolas to have him finish it. Now, I don't see why having Nicolas's patch unfinished forbid me to have some feedback on this one. And asking for such a feedback seems to be a perfectly meaningful reason for putting "needs review"... The only reason I can see for not doing it is that it can trouble the patchbot.

With that, the tests pass up to to trivially failing doctests:

I have made a git branch, but it seems to be massively broken.

Some problems come from Sets().Facade() versus Sets().Facades() as explained before

Some other problems come from #14519

And some other problems I do not understand..
