At Sage days 30, a long brainstorm seems to have finalized the design. Here is a excerpt from the documentation:

A *set factory* `F` is device, whose goal is to construct parent `P`
which models subsets of a big set `S`. Typically, the `P` s are constructed
within families obtained by putting a bunch of constraints `cons` on the
elements of the set `S`. In such a hierarchy of subsets, one needs to have a
fine and easy control on the elements construction. That is, one often needs
that `P` constructs elements in a subclass of its usual class for element. On
the contrary, one also often needs `P` to be a facade parent, meaning that `P`
construct element whose actual parent is not `P` itself.

The role of a set factory is twofold:

- *manage a database* of constructors for the different parents `P = F(cons)`
  depending on the various kinds of constraints `cons`. Note: currently there
  is no real support for that. We are gathering use case before fixing the
  interface.

- ensure that the elements `e = P(...)` created by the different parents
  follows a consistent policy concerning their *class and parent*.

The patch implement this idea while trying to leave as much as possible space 
for further improvement. In particular, I tried to specify the few possible 
things about constraints. I'm even not completely sure about `add_constraints`.
Please comment and review.

As you can see on #10963, the patch is far for being inexistent as Simon and Christian started to review it. Of course it is on the Sage-Combinat queue. I need to ping Nicolas to have him finish it.

Ah, I see, it's about the glitch Sets().Facade() <-> Sets().Facades().

Since anyway the patch is up the queue, I suggest we finish commuting the two patches. Just use Sets().Facades() (we will need to keep the backward compatibility anyway).

With that, the tests pass up to to trivially failing doctests:

```
File "/opt/sage-5.0.beta11/devel/sage-combinat/sage/structureset_factories.py", line 644:
    sage: P2.category()
Expected:
    Join of Category of facade finite enumerated sets and Policy category with facade parent AllPairs
Got:
    Join of Category of finite enumerated sets and Policy category with facade parent AllPairs
**********************************************************************
File "/opt/sage-5.0.beta11/devel/sage-combinat/sage/structure/set_factories.py", line 972:
    sage: P.category()
Expected:
    Join of Category of facade finite enumerated sets and Policy category with facade parent AllPairs
Got:
    Join of Category of finite enumerated sets and Policy category with facade parent AllPairs
```

Cheers,

I have made a git branch, but it seems to be massively broken.

Some problems come from Sets().Facade() versus Sets().Facades() as explained before

Some other problems come from #14519

And some other problems I do not understand..

Was there any need for a merge ?
By the way, I usually do the merge in the other direction. This gives much smaller commits,
as you can see in the commit list.

No there wasn't, but my goal is to update trees to use factories and ultimately to do computation in operads. As you merged 6.7 in operads I also merged this one to avoid going back and forth. 

There is not diff before and after the merge so that you can review on the unmerged version.
