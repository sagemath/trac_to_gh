This ticket is a follw-up from #10236. In there certain changes from #9476 and #9247 were reverted back. Here is what has to be done to make modular symbols with negative sign available for computations with elliptic curves, e.g. p-adic L-series.

Currently eclib can compute the space of modular symbols of sign = -1, but ECModularSymbol in sage.libs.cremona.newforms.pyx can not use them yet to compute {0,r}-

Once this is there, one can modify sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_modular_symbols.py to allow sign = -1 in ModularSymbolECLIB. (Where one has to think a little bit about the normalization.) This would allow to switch in line 1098 of ell_rational_field.py and in line 131 of padic_lseries.py to make use_eclib=True to be default.

I was working on #20864 when I changed the plus symbols to be computed by eclib by default. I wondered if the negative could be added now? Sage normalises the negative ones correctly now. We only need some rational multiple from eclib.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I will make this ticket dependent on another which will upgrade the eclib version in Sage to one which will be released later today.  Two reasons: (1) I fixed a bug which sometimes caused the plus symbols to all be mutiplied by a factor >1 (in known examples, a factor of 2).  (2) I have added a facility to eclib to base symbols at infinity (oo) instead of 0, i.e. it computes the image of either {0,r} or {oo,r} for a given rational.

Example:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve("121b1")
sage: M=E.modular_symbol(1)
Warning : Could not normalize the modular symbols, maybe all further results will be multiplied by -1, 2 or -2.
sage: M(1/7)
-2
```
Here the error message is coming from Sage, not eclib.  And the correct value is 1 though the current eclib version returns 2.

```

This shows that sage's normalisation is correct and eclib has missed the sign.

<a id='comment:15'></a>At this stage, it goes back to John to figure out - if he wants - how to get the correct sign already in eclib.

In the long term, once #21046 is in, I can use the numerical ones to do a very quick and efficient scaling. So one could also wait.

The last modification I did was to highlight the above value in the doctest. There might be others that are wrong.

<a id='comment:17'></a>When I run eclib's own program (called ecnf) on this curve [0,-1,1,-10,-20] I find that {oo, 1/3} and {oo, -1/3} both map to (-3/5,-1), meaning that the plus symbol is -3/5 and the minus symbol is in both cases -1.  This must be a bug since (by definition) theminus symbol should have been negated.

Apologies.  This will require yet another fix to eclib, hence to #22077.  I'll work on that right away.

I did the changes here, but I ran into a very strange compilation error for newforms.pyx. Cython did not recognise "pair". I added an import, but then I got other compilation errors like 

```
_sp = self.nfs.plus_modular_symbol(_r, 0, int(base_at_infinity))
