This ticket is a follw-up from #10236. In there certain changes from #9476 and #9247 were reverted back. Here is what has to be done to make modular symbols with negative sign available for computations with elliptic curves, e.g. p-adic L-series.

Currently eclib can compute the space of modular symbols of sign = -1, but ECModularSymbol in sage.libs.cremona.newforms.pyx can not use them yet to compute {0,r}-

Once this is there, one can modify sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_modular_symbols.py to allow sign = -1 in ModularSymbolECLIB. (Where one has to think a little bit about the normalization.) This would allow to switch in line 1098 of ell_rational_field.py and in line 131 of padic_lseries.py to make use_eclib=True to be default.

The current eclib (eclib-20100711.spkg) has normalization problems in the "sign=-1" modular symbols, which I am currently working on fixing.  The Sage interface should perhaps wait until that is done.

Ping ?

I was working on #20864 when I changed the plus symbols to be computed by eclib by default. I wondered if the negative could be added now? Sage normalises the negative ones correctly now. We only need some rational multiple from eclib.

Implementing this just went up my to-do list, after hearing a lecture by Mazur on his experimental work with Rubin which makes heavy use of this modular symbol functionality.

I will make this ticket dependent on another which will upgrade the eclib version in Sage to one which will be released later today.  Two reasons: (1) I fixed a bug which sometimes caused the plus symbols to all be mutiplied by a factor >1 (in known examples, a factor of 2).  (2) I have added a facility to eclib to base symbols at infinity (oo) instead of 0, i.e. it computes the image of either {0,r} or {oo,r} for a given rational.

Example:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve("121b1")
sage: M=E.modular_symbol(1)
Warning : Could not normalize the modular symbols, maybe all further results will be multiplied by -1, 2 or -2.
sage: M(1/7)
-2
```
Here the error message is coming from Sage, not eclib.  And the correct value is 1 though the current eclib version returns 2.

I am working on this. I spotted a few misprints, but more seriously:

* This code also changes the normalization for modular symbols in sage. In particular, the warning for 121b1 is no longer there, despite the function returning the wrong result.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("121b1")
sage: m = E.modular_symbol(implementation="sage")
sage: m(1/7)
-1/2
sage: me = E.modular_symbol()
sage: me(1/7)
1/2
```

* The second thing is that there are more places which need to change taking eclib automatically for negative symbols. Like line 219 in padic_lseries.py

I found that eclib returns incorrect values currently. This is what causes all the test failures in sage.modular.pollack_stevens after my additional changes. Here is the example I am certain about:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: m = E.modular_symbol(-1,implementation="eclib")
sage: ms = E.modular_symbol(-1,implementation="sage")
sage: m(-1/3)
1/2
sage: ms(-1/3)
-1/2
sage: la = sum(E.an(n)/n*exp(2*RR.pi()*I*(-1/3)*n) for n in [1..100000]); la
-0.387171140749021 - 1.47418172900132*I
sage: E.period_lattice().basis()
(1.26920930427955, 0.634604652139777 + 1.45881661693850*I)
```

This shows that sage's normalisation is correct and eclib has missed the sign.

At this stage, it goes back to John to figure out - if he wants - how to get the correct sign already in eclib.

In the long term, once #21046 is in, I can use the numerical ones to do a very quick and efficient scaling. So one could also wait.

The last modification I did was to highlight the above value in the doctest. There might be others that are wrong.

John, I fear we are doing parallel work. Upload yours.

I did the changes here, but I ran into a very strange compilation error for newforms.pyx. Cython did not recognise "pair". I added an import, but then I got other compilation errors like 

```
_sp = self.nfs.plus_modular_symbol(_r, 0, int(base_at_infinity))
sage/libs/eclib/newforms.pyx:347:46: Call with wrong number of arguments (expected 1, got 3)
```
Honestly I don't understand. So if yours works, I am happy to ditch what I have done here.

Sorry I totally messed up on the other ticket, and this one will have to wait until I sort that out, which will have to be Friday.

Correction (next morning): #22077 is fine and back to "needs review" -- see the remarks there.  Nothing was messed up at all.  I'll now finish cleaning up this one.

So I think that the 3 top commits on the new branch u/cremona/10256new contain all previous work while being based on u/cremona/22077new which is itself based on 7.5.rc1.

If there are additional changes needed here, that's fine as long as they are based on this (and don't require more changes to eclib itself...)
