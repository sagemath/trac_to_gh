Some updates:
* See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cbcb1e1fa080c223) for an impending release on the app store of a first version of an iPhone app.
* See [here on the Android market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.sagemath.droid&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5zYWdlbWF0aC5kcm9pZCJd) for a beta of an Android app.
* See [t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInNhZ2Uua2V5Ym9hcmQubGEiXQ.. here](https://market.android.com/details?id=sage.keyboard.la&feature=search_result#?) for the Sunkyunkwan Univ. app for linear algebra.

My recommendation is that once these things (at least the first two) are stably addressed in official documentation, this ticket can be closed (similarly to how experimental packages are handled).  

Great work, guys!
