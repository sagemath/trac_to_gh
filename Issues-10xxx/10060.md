Currently, there is not any great graphing/scientific calculator available for Androids and iPhones (although iPhone has an okay one - http://www.iphone-calc.com/wp/).  This is a proposal to create an iPhone or Android app that is a front-end to Sage, so users can do stuff like 2D and 3D graphing, among other things.  The app will then pass the user's command to a remote Sage server for computing, and the user will be given the option of running shell mode or the more important calculator-like-UI mode.

* See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cbcb1e1fa080c223) for an impending release on the app store of a first version of an iPhone app.

My recommendation is that once these things (at least the first two) are stably addressed in official documentation, this ticket can be closed (similarly to how experimental packages are handled).  

Great work, guys!
