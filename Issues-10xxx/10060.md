* See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cbcb1e1fa080c223) for an impending release on the app store of a first version of an iPhone app.

My recommendation is that once these things (at least the first two) are stably addressed in official documentation, this ticket can be closed (similarly to how experimental packages are handled).  

Great work, guys!
