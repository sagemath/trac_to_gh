Currently, there is not any great graphing/scientific calculator available for Androids and iPhones (although iPhone has an okay one - http://www.iphone-calc.com/wp/).  This is a proposal to create an iPhone or Android app that is a front-end to Sage, so users can do stuff like 2D and 3D graphing, among other things.  The app will then pass the user's command to a remote Sage server for computing, and the user will be given the option of running shell mode or the more important calculator-like-UI mode.  The UI-mode will contain standard graphing and scientific keys, with the option of unhiding more features like statistics, etc.  A possible feature is having handwriting input recognition for math symbols.  The implication is that for general purposes, a portable Sage for mobile devices can really replace the TI-89 as the graphing/scientific calculator of choice, and can push Sage's name to further mainstream.  Considering how much processing power and storage capacity smartphones have nowadays, it might even be reasonable to have the Sage server be a local installation.

Some updates:
* See [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cbcb1e1fa080c223) for an impending release on the app store of a first version of an iPhone app.
* See [here on the Android market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.sagemath.droid&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5zYWdlbWF0aC5kcm9pZCJd) for a beta of an Android app.
* See [t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInNhZ2Uua2V5Ym9hcmQubGEiXQ.. here](https://market.android.com/details?id=sage.keyboard.la&feature=search_result#?) for the Sunkyunkwan Univ. app for linear algebra.

My recommendation is that once these things (at least the first two) are stably addressed in official documentation, this ticket can be closed (similarly to how experimental packages are handled).  

Great work, guys!
