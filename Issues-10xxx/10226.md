```
I rewrote the ATLAS spkg-install to
* allow customization of architectural defaults via the new `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH` environment variable.
* still build a reasonable library if the automatic tuning process fails to find accurate timings.
* `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path` now searches in `path/libatlas.so` instead of `path/lib/libatlas.so` so it works for people with atlas in `/lib64`, too.
* Threading is now enabled by default. Whats the point of trying to squeeze more performance out of modern processors if you run on one core only?

By default, ATLAS will now try twice to get timings, if that fails build with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast`, and if that fails with `SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base`.

From the new `SPKG.txt`:

```
The package can be configured via two environment variables:

 * SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=path
   If this environment variable is set, path/libatlas.so is used
   and ATLAS is not compiled.

 * SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=arch[,isaext1][,isaext2]...[,isaextN]
   The given architectural default and instruction set extensions are
   used instead of the empirical tuning. Available architectures are 

     POWER3, POWER4, POWER5, PPCG4, PPCG5, P5, P5MMX, PPRO, PII, PIII,
     PM, CoreSolo, CoreDuo, Core2Solo, Core2, Corei7, P4, P4E,
     Efficeon, K7, HAMMER, AMD64K10h, UNKNOWNx86, IA64Itan, IA64Itan2,
     USI, USII, USIII, USIV, UnknownUS, MIPSR1xK, MIPSICE9

   and instruction set extensions are 
   
     AltiVec, SSE3, SSE2, SSE1, 3DNow   

   In addition, you can also set

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast picks defaults for a modern (2-3 year old)
      CPU of your processor line, and 

    - SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base picks defaults that should work for a ~10
      year old CPU.

   For example, 

     SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=Corei7,SSE3,SSE2,SSE1

   would be appropriate for a Core i7 CPU.
```

I implemented the spkg-install script in python without relying on any external programs (except for make, of course). The configuration-detecting part is in the `configuration.py` module. For easier review I will attach the files to this ticket. The complete spkg is here:

This should fix #10051, #9385.

Is the `make_lapack_library()` function in `spkg-install` (originally from `make_correct_shared.sh`) necessary on Solaris? It was just bitrot on Linux...

IMHO, it would be good if we could remove the small amount of python that was in this package, we could start building this as soon as Fortran is built. This would allow us to start building ATLAS much earlier (before building Python). 

We really should update ATLAS too. 

I do wonder if such a large change is appropriate without updating ATLAS. It will make an update even more difficult. 

Given ATLAS takes longer than any other package to build on many systems, getting it building early, which means avoiding Python, would seem a good idea IMHO.

We seem to be using the most recent "stable" version, whatever stable means.  (I'm using the language from the Atlas website.)  It's over a year and a half old, though, with 25 unstable releases since then.  Should we try 3.9.25, released in early November?  Or is it too risky to try something labeled "unstable" by the developers?

ATLAS 3.8.3 is the latest stable release. The next release should come soon but until its out we should stick with 3.8.3

ATLAS is also very difficult to build and it would be a nightmare to rewrite the spkg-install in POSIX shell script. This is why I rewrote the mixture of shell script, Perl, and Python in pure Python. Python is actually very well suited to detect the architectural defaults necessary for building ATLAS.

I also take it from jhpalmieri's comment that "ld -V" exits with a non-zero exit code on t2 (where I don't have an account). I'll add a workaround later...

The next release should come soon but until its out we should stick with 3.8.3\n\nNormally I would agree with you, but Clint, who is the ATLAS developer, has advised us **not** to use the latest stable release, but instead use the development release. He has also said off list that he will not be making many changes to ATLAS due to other commitments. The Sage on gentoo project is using the latest ATLAS without issue\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f3fa4f8737437d7f/5528028cc0c16975?lnk=gst&q=atlas&hl=en#5528028cc0c16975\n\n\n> ATLAS is also very difficult to build and it would be a nightmare to rewrite the spkg-install in POSIX shell script.\n\nAs it is now, I agree. But there's an awful lot of junk in there. It is a non-trivial task, but really we should update ATLAS. \n\n> This is why I rewrote the mixture of shell script, Perl, and Python in pure Python. \n\n\nYes, but it seriously increases the time to to build Sage, as numerous packages have to be build before Python is built, but if \n\n* The small bit of Python in ATLAS is removed\n* The small bit of Python in the Fortran package is removed\n\nthen it will be possible to start the build of ATLAS much earlier. Currently, builds are often building ATLAS for a long time, with nothing else going on. \n\n> \n> I also take it from jhpalmieri's comment that \"ld -V\" exits with a non-zero exit code on t2 (where I don't have an account). I'll add a workaround later...\n\nI can create you an account on `t2.math`. \n\nTo answer John's point, no the passwords are not shared with t2, as the Linux based NIS is not working happily with the Sun NIS. It is possible to get around, but it is a non-trivial task. William asked someone to set it up, without mentioning this to me. The guy left the machine unusable. The only way was to log in on the console. I sorted that out, but have never looked at the NIS issues. \n\nApparenlty the latest ATLAS builds in under an hour on t2.math, compared to the 7 hours it takes now. But I think that is only as a 64-bit application, as I don't  think ATLAS has the 32-bit tuning parameters for t2.math. But I think sorting that out will be somewhat easier than with the current ATLAS, as the new ATLAS has the code to detect the T2+ processors on t2.math. \nDave",

> ATLAS 3.8.3 is the latest stable release. The next release should come soon but until its out we should stick with 3.8.3

Normally I would agree with you, but Clint, who is the ATLAS developer, has advised us **not** to use the latest stable release, but instead use the development release. He has also said off list that he will not be making many changes to ATLAS due to other commitments. The Sage on gentoo project is using the latest ATLAS without issue

https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f3fa4f8737437d7f/5528028cc0c16975?lnk=gst&q=atlas&hl=en#5528028cc0c16975


> ATLAS is also very difficult to build and it would be a nightmare to rewrite the spkg-install in POSIX shell script.

As it is now, I agree. But there's an awful lot of junk in there. It is a non-trivial task, but really we should update ATLAS. 

> This is why I rewrote the mixture of shell script, Perl, and Python in pure Python. 


Yes, but it seriously increases the time to to build Sage, as numerous packages have to be build before Python is built, but if 

* The small bit of Python in ATLAS is removed
* The small bit of Python in the Fortran package is removed

then it will be possible to start the build of ATLAS much earlier. Currently, builds are often building ATLAS for a long time, with nothing else going on.

I can create you an account on `t2.math`. 

To answer John's point, no the passwords are not shared with t2, as the Linux based NIS is not working happily with the Sun NIS. It is possible to get around, but it is a non-trivial task. William asked someone to set it up, without mentioning this to me. The guy left the machine unusable. The only way was to log in on the console. I sorted that out, but have never looked at the NIS issues. 

Apparenlty the latest ATLAS builds in under an hour on t2.math, compared to the 7 hours it takes now. But I think that is only as a 64-bit application, as I don't  think ATLAS has the 32-bit tuning parameters for t2.math. But I think sorting that out will be somewhat easier than with the current ATLAS, as the new ATLAS has the code to detect the T2+ processors on t2.math.

I aimed at **removing** the Python dependency of ATLAS. ;-)


I'm not in principle against using Python for installation scripts, but unless Python gets a prerequisite (or of course is required by the package or its prerequisites anyway)...

Maybe we somehow should support `SAGE_ALLOW_SYSTEM_PYTHON_FOR_BUILD`.

Hi,

I had problems compiling Sage-4.6 both on i7_860 and i7-740QM, whereas compilation on i7-950, Xeon-E5530, Quad-9550 ran smoothly. I use environment variables:

export MAKE='make -jN'

export SAGE64='yes'

export SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD='yes'

with N=number of cores (not hw threads).

Ok, so that didn't quite work out on the 860 and 740QM, I mean it took ages to compile, spending lots of time in Atlas. So I applied the p17 change, added the variables mentioned for i7, and I also as obliged to use the performance governor :

sudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance

Otherwise, even the p17 didn't detect the top frequency and only compiled with a flag indicating the lowest frequency available.

So now all my CPUs compile Sage in a reasonably coherent amount of time.

I'm still puzzled by the logic of making changes which:

* Make it much more difficult to speed up the Sage build process by removing the small amount of Python necessary to start the ATLAS build earlier.
* Implementing changes, some of which are unnecessary if ATLAS is updated. 

IMGHO, the two most logical things to do the the ATLAS package are:

1) Update the ATLAS version, which has support for many new CPUs and so allow a lot of the Sage-specfic CPU hacks to be removed. It also has the facility to use a generic set of tuning parameters.
2) Remove the few lines of Python, so ATLAS no longer depends on Python. Then the build of ATLAS can be started much earlier. This would speed up the Sage build, as ATLAS would be building for longer. ATLAS is ofgten the only item being built, so is a bottleneck. 

This patch seems a backward step to me.

Right now the build process is run by a Python script that calls a shell script that calls a Python script that mostly just runs shell commands and also a shell script that calls a Perl script.

Volker has now updated the spkg so that it does not get confused by "ld -V" on MacOSX (this is of course very minor).
It works on MacOSX 10.6 just fine.

I don't think Volker will forget about these two things, but just to make a note of it:

* the `time.sleep` doesn't work; `time` doesn't seem to be imported
* to insure that this will work with Python 2.4, you'll need to change the tuples to lists, since that version of Python strangely didn't support `.index()` on tuples.

I know it's a detail, but I would prefer the ATLAS `spkg-install` does NOT print the message

```
Finished installing ATLAS.
```

Simply because grepping logs for `'^Finished installing '` now gives

```
[...]
Finished installing python-2.6.4.p9.spkg
Finished installing fortran-20100629.spkg
Finished installing lapack-20071123.p2.spkg

Sorry the atlas spkg was an older version, and I accidentally dropped a couple of compile fixes. I've updated the spkg (same place) with the most recent version.

The OSX issue has been fixed previously. It also definitely works on t2. Is fulvia a supported platform? Sage refuses to compile there unless `SAGE_PORT` is set.

'fulvia' is a Solaris 10 x86 machine on Skynet. Sage builds on that fine. 

'hawk' is a Sun Ultra 27 running OpenSolaris and is my personal machine. 

The buildbot regularly builds Sage on both of these machines.

http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris has information about building on Solaris on SPARC. The main difference on x86 is that one must build binutils, to get the GNU assembler 'as', then configure gcc to use that assembler, rather than the Sun assembler. But use the Sun linker, as one does on SPARC.

Building on OpenSolaris is the same as on Solaris 10 x86 - just see what's done on skynet. 

The directory structure on 'hawk' of `/ATLAS32` is 

```
/ATLAS32/lib
/ATLAS32/include
```

That corresponds with the current behavior in Sage, where one sets `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` to be `/ATLAS32`. 

I don't know if we actually need the include files, in which case there may be an argument for making SAGE_ATLAS_LIB point to `/ATLAS32/lib` or `/ATLAS32/lib64` or `/usr/lib64/atlas` etc. I'm fairly sure one can delete the include files on a system-wide install of ATLAS and Sage will still build with just the ATLAS libraries.

It fails on OpenSolaris in 64-bit mode. I reports not all 4 libraries are present, though I'm not convinced all 4 were needed. Anyway, that might be an installation issue at this end with the 64-bit libraries, as I've not used them much. 

Here's the failure message:

I'm not convinced we need **any** shared libraries. I don't believe ATLAS builds any, and certainly Mathematica comes with libatlas.a, but no libatlas.so. 

Note there is no `liblapack.so`, yet this builds fine. 

On the 64-bit version,

but I must have omitted to copy `liblapack.a` there, which is why I had to build ATLAS from scratch, which takes about 15 minutes on this machine in 64-bit mode, but a few hours in 32-bit mode, since the ATLAS package does not have the right tuning parameters for 32-bit code. 

I've since copied the 64-bit liblapack.a to my global installation directory, so now the directory has 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/pre-release/64/sage-4.7.alpha1/local/lib$  ls /ATLAS64/lib

Documentation changes for SAGE_ATLAS_LIB are at #10666.

I haven't changed the os.popen2 call since a) its also in the sage library and b) its probably better to be backward than future compatible if we ever want to attempt to use the system python for executing spkg scripts. But then, I don't care too much about popen vs. subprocess and will be happy to rewrite it if you insist.

I'll reiterate the point that ATLAS takes a long time to build, which could be speeded up considerably if a couple of minor changes were made to the Fortran package to remove its unnecessary reliance on Python. If we build Fortran earlier, we could start the build of ATLAS much earlier, so reduce the time to build Sage. For much of the time building Sage, ATLAS is the only package being built. 

As such, I feel this change is a retrograde step. 

IMHO, the best approach for ATLAS would be to

* Update it to use the pre-release/alpha version, as advised by the ATLAS developer and has been used in Gentoo.
* Check what (if any) changes need to be made to ATLAS. I think the new ATLAS will address some of the issues this update attempts to solve. 
* Rewrite this package to use a POSIX shell commands
* Rewrite the Fortran package to avoid the very small amount of Python. 
* Change the deps file to remove the dependency of ATLAS on Python. 
 
That would allow ATLAS to be built before (or in parallel with Python), so speeding up the Sage build time. 

I feel these changes are a retrograde step.

If the version of ATLAS is updated, many if not all of the Sage defaults for different processors can be removed. I know many of them in Sage were available in the alpha releases ages ago. 

The buildbots on "hawk" and "t2.math" both  use a preinstalled version of ATLAS, so testing on those machine would have to be done with unsetting SAGE_ATLAS_LIB in the buildbot's configuration.

I built Sage-4.7 with my atlas-3.8.4.spkg on iras overnight and it worked fine. Looking at the log file, it seems like atlas just failed to get timings because of system load. 

I updated my atlas spkg to force the architecture to IA64Itan2/IA64Itan if the automatic tuning fails, this would give us two more shots at a successful build on Itanium and match the behaviour of the old atlas spkg (4 build attempts altogether).

Volker, I tried again with the old atlas-3.8.4 (i.e. the package which I originally said didn't work) and after 4 attempts at building Sage, it finally succeeded.

However, I think this is still a regression, because I did not get atlas build failures usually (even with SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD=yes).

I will need to do some more testing.

one more positive "review" (haven't read the actual patch). Had issues with Atlas building on fresh Sage on ubuntu 11.04 x86. Downloaded Volker's new spkg and put it in spkg/standard.

First 'make' run failed again for 'probe/aux' problem. Setting SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast made everything go smooth.
