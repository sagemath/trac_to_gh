On the skynet machine fulvia (SunOS 5.10 i86pc), we get some doctest failures in `sage/tests/cmdline.py` (added by #10300):

For the first, we need something analogous to the `readlink` command, for the second we simply need to increase the timeout.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
The line

```
readlink "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" | sed "s/sage-//"
```
from `sage-sage` can probably be replaced by:

```
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" && pwd -P | sed 's|.*/||; s|^sage-||'
```
which is a lot uglier, but at least it works on Linux, OS X 10.4, SunOS 5.10.

I will prepare a patch.

Another option would have been to use the readline system call, which is defined by POSIX

but not the command, where POSIX defines no such command.

Part of the timeout issue on fulvia is the long running background jobs. I'm not sure if the buildbot disables them (there's a README somewhere under /usr/local). But otherwise that machine will be dog slow. 

If anyone wants an account on *hawk* which is running a similar operating system to Solaris 10, but is a much faster machine, I don't mind giving them one. 

It takes about 3 seconds to start Sage on my 3.33 GHz Sun. I can't measure the time it takes to start Mathematica - at least not without using some function to measure it with ns grandularity. (OK, not quite ns, but the Mathematica 7 command line starts effectively instantly. The GUI takes about 5 seconds, which is in fact a bit longer than Sage).

Just for the record:

`SAGE_ROOT/sage` also uses `realpath` if `readlink` is not available / fails.

Don't know what systems (besides Linux) support that though.

Since we rely on Bash, `cd ... && pwd -P ...` is of course more "portable" (i.e., generic, and actually POSIX), and likely to be a couple of femtoseconds faster (unless `cd` takes too long ;-) ).

Note that there is a slight difference: `readlink` also reads dead links (deleted current Sage branches), while `cd` of course fails in that case.

Perhaps keep also the old line, e.g.

```sh
    (readlink "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" || 
      (cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" && pwd -P | sed 's|.*/||') ) \
    | sed 's|^sage-||'

The Skynet system `fulvia` doesn't have `readlink` nor `realpath`.

The error message sounds like a good idea, but I wouldn't automatically change branches.

OT: Does the caret (interpreted as mark-up) in Jeroen's reply to my code example (right before "Why?") also span multiple comments(!) for others?

For me, **all** text (including the headlines)  is typeset in superscript mode from there on.

I'll try to close the tag here: ^
