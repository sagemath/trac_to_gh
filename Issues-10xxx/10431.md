On the skynet machine fulvia (SunOS 5.10 i86pc), we get some doctest failures in `sage/tests/cmdline.py` (added by #10300):

For the first, we need something analogous to the `readlink` command, for the second we simply need to increase the timeout.

The line

```
readlink "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" | sed "s/sage-//"
```
from `sage-sage` can probably be replaced by:

```
cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" && pwd -P | sed 's|.*/||; s|^sage-||'
```
which is a lot uglier, but at least it works on Linux, OS X 10.4, SunOS 5.10.

I will prepare a patch.

Part of the timeout issue on fulvia is the long running background jobs. I'm not sure if the buildbot disables them (there's a README somewhere under /usr/local). But otherwise that machine will be dog slow. 

If anyone wants an account on *hawk* which is running a similar operating system to Solaris 10, but is a much faster machine, I don't mind giving them one. 

It takes about 3 seconds to start Sage on my 3.33 GHz Sun. I can't measure the time it takes to start Mathematica - at least not without using some function to measure it with ns grandularity. (OK, not quite ns, but the Mathematica 7 command line starts effectively instantly. The GUI takes about 5 seconds, which is in fact a bit longer than Sage).

Just for the record:

`SAGE_ROOT/sage` also uses `realpath` if `readlink` is not available / fails.

Don't know what systems (besides Linux) support that though.

Since we rely on Bash, `cd ... && pwd -P ...` is of course more "portable" (i.e., generic, and actually POSIX), and likely to be a couple of femtoseconds faster (unless `cd` takes too long ;-) ).

Note that there is a slight difference: `readlink` also reads dead links (deleted current Sage branches), while `cd` of course fails in that case.

Perhaps keep also the old line, e.g.

```sh
    (readlink "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" || 
      (cd "$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage" && pwd -P | sed 's|.*/||') ) \
    | sed 's|^sage-||'

The Skynet system `fulvia` doesn't have `readlink` nor `realpath`.

The error message sounds like a good idea, but I wouldn't automatically change branches.

OT: Does the caret (interpreted as mark-up) in Jeroen's reply to my code example (right before "Why?") also span multiple comments(!) for others?

For me, **all** text (including the headlines)  is typeset in superscript mode from there on.

I'll try to close the tag here: ^
