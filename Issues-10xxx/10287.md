This is part of the larger project at #7656. See [this thread](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/57890c6e134a5d45) for some background information.

The relevant module is

```
sage/misc/bitset.pxi
```

and the function concerned is `bitset_realloc()`. A memleak occurs when we have a bitset of positive size (or capacity) and then reallocate the size to be zero. To pick up the memleak, I first loaded Sage 4.6.1.alpha1 under valgrind and quit Sage without doing any computation. The resulting memleak summary is:

```
==26274== LEAK SUMMARY:
==26274==    definitely lost: 80 bytes in 3 blocks.
==26274==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 10 blocks.
==26274==      possibly lost: 562,324 bytes in 1,305 blocks.
==26274==    still reachable: 60,547,159 bytes in 41,676 blocks.
==26274==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
==26274== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==26274== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
```

I then applied the following patch to the Sage library, see [attachment:test.patch]:

I loaded Sage under valgrind again and performed the following computation:

```python
sage: from sage.misc.test import test
sage: test()
```

which resulted in the following memleak summary:

```
==16502== LEAK SUMMARY:
==16502==    definitely lost: 88 bytes in 4 blocks.
==16502==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 10 blocks.
==16502==      possibly lost: 563,732 bytes in 1,308 blocks.
==16502==    still reachable: 60,550,541 bytes in 41,691 blocks.

==16502== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==16502== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
```

Notice that despite the function `test()` explicitly freeing memory,
the report on "definitely lost" shows that we leaked an extra 8 bytes
(compare the 80 and 88 above in the first and second memleak
summaries, respectively). Finally, I applied the following patch to
the Sage library:

```diff

```

I loaded Sage under valgrind a third time and performed the following
computation, same as above:

```python
sage: from sage.misc.test import test
sage: test()
```

The corresponding memleak summary is:

```
==22029== LEAK SUMMARY:
==22029==    definitely lost: 80 bytes in 3 blocks.
==22029==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 10 blocks.
==22029==      possibly lost: 564,252 bytes in 1,309 blocks.
==22029==    still reachable: 60,550,168 bytes in 41,696 blocks.
==22029==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
==22029== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==22029== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
```

Notice that the summary for "definitely lost" now shows 80 bytes, the same as for the first memleak summary above. Thus the patch `memleak.patch` fixes the memleak in `sage.misc.bitset.bitset_realloc`.

+This is part of the larger project at #7656. See [this thread](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/57890c6e134a5d45) for some background information.
 
+The relevant module is
+
+```
+sage/misc/bitset.pxi
+```
+
+and the function concerned is `bitset_realloc()`. A memleak occurs when we have a bitset of positive size (or capacity) and then reallocate the size to be zero. To pick up the memleak, I first loaded Sage 4.6.1.alpha1 under valgrind and quit Sage without doing any computation. The resulting memleak summary is:
+
+```
+==26274== LEAK SUMMARY:
+==26274==    definitely lost: 80 bytes in 3 blocks.
+==26274==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 10 blocks.
+==26274==      possibly lost: 562,324 bytes in 1,305 blocks.
+==26274==    still reachable: 60,547,159 bytes in 41,676 blocks.
+==26274==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
+==26274== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
+==26274== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
+```
+
+I then applied the following patch to the Sage library, see [attachment:test.patch]:

+
+I loaded Sage under valgrind again and performed the following computation:
+
+```python
+sage: from sage.misc.test import test
+sage: test()
+```
+
+which resulted in the following memleak summary:
+
+```
+==16502== LEAK SUMMARY:
+==16502==    definitely lost: 88 bytes in 4 blocks.
+==16502==    indirectly lost: 240 bytes in 10 blocks.

+==16502== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
+==16502== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes
+```
+
+Notice that despite the function `test()` explicitly freeing memory,
+the report on "definitely lost" shows that we leaked an extra 8 bytes
+(compare the 80 and 88 above in the first and second memleak
+summaries, respectively). Finally, I applied the following patch to
+the Sage library:

+I loaded Sage under valgrind a third time and performed the following

+
+The corresponding memleak summary is:
