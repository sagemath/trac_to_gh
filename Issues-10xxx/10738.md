By preparing a suitable symlink, this lets a local attacker at least delete any user file:

```
cd "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}" || exit 2
TESTFILE=sage-testcc-$$.c

cat >$TESTFILE <<"E*O*F"
```
Is there any reason for not using mktemp?

Low priority because that is only called during compile time...

`mktemp` is not POSIX, so how (if at all) it is implemented on a platform is anyone's guess. I know it's implemented differently on Solaris to Linux, but it may well not exist on AIX, HP-UX or any other POSIX system. So let's forget about `mktemp` using such a command. 

I fail to see how one could use this script to delete a file that one could not delete with rm. The write would fail unless one had write access to the file one wished to delete. 

So unless I'm missing something, this has absolutely zero security risk. 

I've cc'ed a couple of others for their opinion.

Of the three options, the second seems the best to me.

Since it is not a compiler wrapper, I fail to see why it should be renamed to "compilerwrapper" I can think of better names than the current one, as it does not actually aim to test the compiler, but rather determine what compiler is in use. So whilst long-winded, perhaps "determine-c-compiler.sh" is more appropriate.
