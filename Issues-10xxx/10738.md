By preparing a suitable symlink, this lets a local attacker at least delete any user file:

```
cd "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}" || exit 2
TESTFILE=sage-testcc-$$.c

cat >$TESTFILE <<"E*O*F"
```
Is there any reason for not using mktemp?

Low priority because that is only called during compile time...

`mktemp` is not POSIX, so how (if at all) it is implemented on a platform is anyone's guess. I know it's implemented differently on Solaris to Linux, but it may well not exist on AIX, HP-UX or any other POSIX system. So let's forget about `mktemp` using such a command. 

I fail to see how one could use this script to delete a file that one could not delete with rm. The write would fail unless one had write access to the file one wished to delete. 

So unless I'm missing something, this has absolutely zero security risk. 

I've cc'ed a couple of others for their opinion.

   1. Gooduser runs `testcc.sh`
   2. Gooduser notices that `/home/gooduser/valuabledocument.tex` has been overwritten.

Gooduser could, of course, have always used rm to delete his documents but Naughtyuser does not have the permissions to delete another user's file.

Of the three options, the second seems the best to me.

Just to clarify, I think the best option would be to put the temporary file in $SAGE_LOCAL/spkg/build (which is writable at compile time). 

The scripts are used in a couple of spkg_install scripts, but it is not used much. The idea would be to use it more if a port to the Sun compiler was done.

Since it is not a compiler wrapper, I fail to see why it should be renamed to "compilerwrapper" I can think of better names than the current one, as it does not actually aim to test the compiler, but rather determine what compiler is in use. So whilst long-winded, perhaps "determine-c-compiler.sh" is more appropriate.
