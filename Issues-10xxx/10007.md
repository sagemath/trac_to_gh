When building a new parent P which has a structure of module, one can
currently can derive from CombinatorialFreeModule. It would be very
very good, when mathematically appropriate to be able to derive
instead from FreeModule, in order to benefit from its efficiency and
many functionalities.

This is currently not possible, because arithmetic creates new
elements whose class is FreeModuleElement_* instead of the derived
class for the elements of P (the parent remains P as desired):

```
sage: class Bla_parent(sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_generic):
....:         class Element(sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense):
....:             pass
....: 
sage: F = Bla_parent(QQ,6,6)
sage: F
<class '__main__.Bla_parent_with_category'>
sage: p = F.Element(F,(1,2,3,4,5,6))
sage: p
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
sage: p.__class__
<class '__main__.Element'>
sage: (p+p).__class__
<type 'sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense'>
```

This is long fixed. Probably due to the new coercion system.
