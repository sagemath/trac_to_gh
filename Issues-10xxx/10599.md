This is an example from sage-support that should work as is, but doesn't since 1/v[1] is an AlgebraicNumber.  

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: M = matrix(3,[1,-1,-1,-1,3,1,-1,1,3])
sage: v=M.eigenvalues()
sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==1/v[1], [x,-3,3], [y,-3,3],[z,-3,3])
```

Its not clear to me where the appropriate change should be made.
