This is an example from sage-support that should work as is, but doesn't since 1/v[1] is an AlgebraicNumber.  

```
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: M = matrix(3,[1,-1,-1,-1,3,1,-1,1,3])
sage: v=M.eigenvalues()
sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==1/v[1], [x,-3,3], [y,-3,3],[z,-3,3])
```

Its not clear to me where the appropriate change should be made.

**Assignee:** @jasongrout, @williamstein

**Keywords:** conversion, algebraicnumber, implicit_plot3d

This is all just fine, thank you.

However, *if* you have time, I noticed something weird that is pre-existing:

```diff
-    -  ``yrange`` - a 2-tuple (y_min, y_may) or a 3-tuple (y, y_min, y_may)
+    -  ``yrange`` -- a 2-tuple (y_min, y_may) or a 3-tuple (y, y_min, y_may)
 
-    -  ``zrange`` - a 2-tuple (z_min, z_maz) or a 3-tuple (z, z_min, z_maz)
+    -  ``zrange`` -- a 2-tuple (z_min, z_maz) or a 3-tuple (z, z_min, z_maz)
```
`y_may`, `z_maz`?  probably these should be `y_max`, `z_max` since it isn't `y_miy`,`z_miz`.  I guess we could open another ticket and fix it later, but that seems a bit excessive if you have this file and branch ready for edit/push.  Let me know what you think.
