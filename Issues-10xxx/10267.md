Add method for finite word that returns the balance of self. 

The balance of a word is the smallest number `q` such that self is `q`-balanced.

```
sage: w = Word('11112222')
sage: w.is_balanced(2)
False
sage: w.is_balanced(3)
False
sage: w.is_balanced(4)
True
sage: w.is_balanced(5)
True
sage: w.balance()
4
```
