Following the discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/631cd4e0a927d793?pli=1, it seemed like a good idea to speed up comparisons of integers with ints, because this often arises when using the preparser.  I also added shortcuts for python longs and floats because it seemed like a good idea.

Here's a major bug this introduces:

```
        822	            elif PyFloat_CheckExact(left): 
 	823	                c = -mpz_cmp_d((<Integer>right).value, PyFloat_AsDouble(right))
```

Note that you're comparing right to itself.

Another thought I had is that the tmp mpz could be put at the module scope and never mpz_clear'd.  This means a tiny leak, but it removes the mpz_init and mpz_clear completely, and replaces them with a single mpz_set, which could be a big savings in time, since memory allocation is so expensive. 

In fact, looking in integer.pyx I see this near the top:

```
cdef mpz_t mpz_tmp
mpz_init(mpz_tmp)
```
so just use that mpz_tmp that is sitting there, instead of making another one.

Thanks for catching that.  I don't know why my test -1.5r < 3 didn't crash horribly...

I've switched to using the mpz_tmp as you suggested.

On adding some more tests, I've discovered that this patch changes the behavior of comparison of large floats to sage integers.  Now we have

```
sage: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0r==1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
False
```
whereas it was True before.  Of course, before

```
sage: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.1r==1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
True
```

I think it's still worth using `mpz_cmp_d` because of the speed benefit; users should know to be careful with these kinds of floating point comparisons.  Do you agree?

It turns out that the line I flagged above as introducing a major bug, which roed fixed, in fact introduces an easy 1-liner way to segfault Sage:

```
sage: float('nan') > 1
Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
BOOM
```

See #12149.
