The problem seems to be the first numeric parameter. This will be easy to fix.

OK, now I see that the following has always been possible:

```
sage: T=QuaternionAlgebra(RR(3), RR(3))
sage: T
Quaternion Algebra (3.00000000000000, 3.00000000000000) with base ring Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

This looks good - some suggestions follow.  Let me know, and then I'll run tests.

1.  Maybe `is_RingElement` would be an improved test, as it would catch some things sooner and give a better error message?

```
sage: a=PermutationGroupElement([1,2,3])
sage: QuaternionAlgebra(a, a)
<snip>
AttributeError: 'SymmetricGroup_with_category' object has no attribute 'fraction_field'
sage: is_Element(a)
<snip>
True
sage: is_RingElement(a)
False
```

2.  I think that the error message could be more informative.  Probably be good to have a doctest that raises this error (you could use the permutation example above).

```
ValueError('input is not an element of a ring: {0}'.format(a))
```

3.  It might be good practice to preface your new tests with a sentence saying they check Trac #10601.

Simon,

Looks good and passes all long tests.  Can you make just one more edit?

```
# The following tests address the issues rased in trac ticket 10601

can go right up in the text preceding, that seems to be the custom - ie as part of the visible documentation (and "raised" needs a letter).  If you can do that, I'll just peek at the patch and we'll be done.  Thanks for your work on this.

No problem - there's a lot to keep track of, and that's what reviews are for.  (And I could have been more explicit about where to put the Trac number.)
