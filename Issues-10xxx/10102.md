I don't understand how any version of Sage with the patch [trac_9343-part2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9343/trac_9343-part2.patch.gz) from #9343 ever managed to compile, because `mod2` was changed to `sage_mod2` in the **include** file but not in the **src** file.

Looks good to me. I'm surprised that changing the .h file didn't trigger a re-compile of the clib, and any modules that directly depend on it.

I think the question is more: how did this code ever work without this patch?  I am sure that I've compiled and tested the sage-4.6-alphas from scratch many times...

I have made a follow-up ticket to clean up these files: #10103.  I don't plan to work on that for now, though.
