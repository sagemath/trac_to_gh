That's something different I think. In the reported bug a failing coercion is being reported while it should probably just be returning False.

Compare with:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<z> = ZZ[]
sage: z in R
False
```

vs

```
sage: R(z)
*kaboom*

Patch applies cleanly, and doctest passes both before and after application.

Running

```
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(256,'x')
sage: LR = [R.gen(i) for i in range(256)]
sage: S = PolynomialRing(GF(2),256,'y')
sage: S.gen(8) in LR
```
now returns false as expected.

Running

```
sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(256,'x')
sage: S = PolynomialRing(GF(2),256,'y')
sage: R(S.gen(8))
```
