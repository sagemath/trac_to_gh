# Issue 10345: OS architecture check for Sage bash script

Currently the Sage bash script on the Linux version (I can't speak for any others) does not check OS architecture upon execution. Although not necessary for running versions lower than the OS architecture, if it is higher it will not run. The bash script should verify the architecture and return an error if incorrect. It is relatively easy to fix, by appending the following lines to the bash script:


```
SAGE_VERSION="x86_64" #Replace with specific Sage architecture for that distribution
OS="`uname -m`" #Checks OS architecture
if [ "$OS" = "i386 (Or whatever OS equals on 32-bit machines)" ]; then
    echo "**************************************************************"
    echo " Error: Wrong OS architecture. Please download the 32-bit     "
    echo " version.                                                     "
    echo "**************************************************************"
    exit 1
