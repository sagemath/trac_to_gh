Following a request to test the following 3 lines of code on #8433

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
``` 

I did this on Sage 4.5.1 running on Solaris 10 and found no problems of excessive CPU time as reported at #8433. However, the quality of the output leaves a lot to be desired, and appears to show discontinuities which are not in the function. 

Attached are two images showing the output from Sage using

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
``` 

![](sage-plot3d-sinx-siny.png)

and Mathematica 7.0.1 using the following command

```
Plot3D[Sqrt[Sin[x] Sin[y]],{x,-2 Pi, 2 Pi},{y, - 2 Pi, 2 Pi}] 
```

Whilst Mathematica's output is obviously more asetically pleasing, with the false colour, the main problem with the Sage output is that it shows discontinuities which simply should not exist in the function being plotted.

It would be good if we could improve this. Jason Grout had some idea what the problem probably is.
