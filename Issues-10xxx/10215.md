Following a request to test the following 3 lines of code on #8433

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
``` 

I did this on Sage 4.5.1 running on Solaris 10 and found no problems of excessive CPU time as reported at #8433. However, the quality of the output leaves a lot to be desired, and appears to show discontinuities which are not in the function. 

Attached are two images showing the output from Sage using

```
y=var('y')
B=plot3d(sqrt(sin(x)*sin(y)),(x,-2*pi,2*pi),(y,-2*pi,2*pi),viewer='tachyon')
B.show()
```

and Mathematica 7.0.1 using the following command

```
Plot3D[Sqrt[Sin[x] Sin[y]],{x,-2 Pi, 2 Pi},{y, - 2 Pi, 2 Pi}] 
```

It would be good if we could improve this. Jason Grout had some idea what the problem probably is.

*I think the problem is that in Sage, we do not try to break up plotting triangles to find out the actual boundaries of a domain.
