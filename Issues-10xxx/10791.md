If a set of vectors has a linearly dependent subset, followed by a vector outside the span of that subset, then the presence of a zero vector in the orthogonal set causes division by a zero dot product.

There are various other improvements that can be made in this routine.

```

Patch summary:

* Original Gram-Schmidt has been adjusted to raise an error on linearly dependent input.

* Free module version of original Gram-Schmidt was used just one place, and it has been referenced directly, rather than through the matrix version.

* Matrix version is totally rewritten, building on QR factorizations as possible to get orthonormal bases.  Linearly dependent subsets should be handled properly now.  Return format has, by necessity, changed.

* The "noscale" helper method is reminiscent of the old code, but written in a column-oriented QR style.

Yes, I became aware of this many months ago.  However, I never know just what to be catching.  In other words, it would be nice to use a `__call___` method as a way to sanitize input, but I often have trouble figuring out just how the code will react when it fails (just what type of error will come back).

So which is preferable:

```
try:
   n = Integer(n_input)
except SomeError:
   raise ....
```

or

```
if not is_Integer(n_input):
    raise ...
else:
    n = Integer(n_input)
```

In the first case is it enough to just catch  `TypeError` and `ValueError`?

In the second case, I am often at a loss to decide which to use, in particular I once spent a very long time trying to determine if an input was a real number.

So my naked except is really an act of desperation.  Advice would be appreciated.

Rob

The naked except has been corrected to:

```
        try:
            F = R.fraction_field()
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError(<snipped>)
```

This had a positive review back at comment 5.  Since then it has received a documentation fix (double colons) and the fix on the except clause.  Those are the only changes since then.

I do not know what is up with the patchbot, as it seems totally dead at the moment.  In any event, it seems counter-productive to wait on it while it is still being developed.  This is passing all tests for me right now.

Turns out the IEEE specification includes a "negative zero."  Rounding and `.zero_at()` might do the trick.

Six such changes in the "negative zero" patch.  Successful with one instance where I converted a `-0.0` to `0.0`.

Jeroen - could you easily test/review this on the two failing machines?  If it works across three architectures, I'll then apply the same technique to #10795, #10837 with some confidence.

Thanks for your patience with this (exasperating) numerical work.

Jason, John, Jeroen - thanks for the attention to this, and the other outstanding linear algebra tickets.  I've been on an (extended) Sage vacation, but I think you are reeling me back in.  ;-)

This does need work.  Fix at #11544 prevents printing from having a side-effect that increases precision over QQbar.  I think this work predates that change.  So it does need work at the moment.

I am building a fresh alpha right now and will try to get on top of outstanding tickets later today.  It'd be great to get a few of thse into 4.8 if it is not too late - I'll be using this stuff in class in the spring with my Sage-enabled textbook and a few of us are working on this CRC linear algebra handbook chapter that will be doctestable.

Thanks,
Rob

Oh man, that was painful.  I am really rusty.  Use it or lose it.  But I'm back.

Patch fixes failing doctests over QQbar, mostly by checking small norms on matrices which should be the zero matrix.  A bit brutal, but we don't have `round()` and `zero_at()` for matrices over QQbar.  (Those'd be a nice additions, no?).

I got identical failures on Ubuntu.  Now passing all tests in matrix/matrix2.pyx.  My 4.8.alpha3 has some weirdness (Atlas segfaults), but I think this should be OK.

Thanks for the look, John and Jason.  Off to investigate a few other things.
