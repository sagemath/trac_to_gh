Because I think it should prompt on startup to add to `PATH`, provided of course that `sage` isn't already in `PATH`.  And of course there would also be a "Do not ask again" button.  I haven't gotten around to this yet, so if you think it's a bad idea then you can go ahead and review this.

I think that could be another ticket.  Especially since this will confuse people who don't know what a `PATH` is.

By the way, I use .profile to add things to the path.   Just sayin'.

Status:  I like this.  But I couldn't get it to work with the `~/bin` version.  Even after moving my .profile (confirmed in effect) and then creating the .bashrc with only the requested line, it didn't work.  Yes, I closed the terminal and opened a new one.  

Now, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  

So I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).

```	
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.
On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells
(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). 
This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. –
```

Otherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.

```
