It doesn't depend on #10555, but it does rely on 8473 (because of nib changes), so we should probably say (for the patchbot):

Because I think it should prompt on startup to add to `PATH`, provided of course that `sage` isn't already in `PATH`.  And of course there would also be a "Do not ask again" button.  I haven't gotten around to this yet, so if you think it's a bad idea then you can go ahead and review this.

I think that could be another ticket.  Especially since this will confuse people who don't know what a `PATH` is.

By the way, I use .profile to add things to the path.   Just sayin'.

That's part of why I haven't gotten to it yet.  I'm not sure how to clearly ask the question.  You're probably right that it's better to split this into a new ticket.  I was planning to do it, but it's harder than I thought (not technically, but design-wise).

Now, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  

So I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).

```	
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.
On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells
(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). 
This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. –
```

Otherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.

and similarly for `bin/sage`.

So let me be clear that the thing created works; it just doesn't work when you put it in .bashrc unless you go to some trouble, because Mac doesn't seem to respect that very much.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Ok, that seems like a good point.  That should be the case for the `rm` commands as well, though even though there was nothing to remove the commands still worked, but they did raise the message.  Maybe `rm` is different in that regard.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Okay, this works fine now, in all situations discussed above.

I'm wondering whether you might want to add a comment in the scripts patch about how to REMOVE this from one's path.  Just wondering.

Finally, is there a whole bunch of commented code in this?  The stuff about spotlight and 10.5 versus 10.6, etc., all inside `/* stuff */`?  Should that be removed, or at least should it be pointed out that this is a comment?

I haven't tested this on anything but Snow Leopard.  Probably we should (and it would be easy to do when #11026 is) but I seriously doubt there would be problems, since the main thing is the Unix command.

That's a good idea.  I've added a patch.

This was a different approach that I decided not to go with.  I thought the code might be useful, but you're right it shouldn't be there.
