Does this depend on #10555 and #8473?  Just checking.

Because I think it should prompt on startup to add to `PATH`, provided of course that `sage` isn't already in `PATH`.  And of course there would also be a "Do not ask again" button.  I haven't gotten around to this yet, so if you think it's a bad idea then you can go ahead and review this.

I think that could be another ticket.  Especially since this will confuse people who don't know what a `PATH` is.

By the way, I use .profile to add things to the path.   Just sayin'.

That's part of why I haven't gotten to it yet.  I'm not sure how to clearly ask the question.  You're probably right that it's better to split this into a new ticket.  I was planning to do it, but it's harder than I thought (not technically, but design-wise).

Yes, I closed the terminal and opened a new one.  \n\nNow, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  \n\nSo I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).\n\n```\t\nBy default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.\nOn every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells\n(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). \nThis is why \u201cput source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile\u201d is standard advice. \u2013\n```\n\nOtherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.",

Status:  I like this.  But I couldn't get it to work with the `~/bin` version.  Even after moving my .profile (confirmed in effect) and then creating the .bashrc with only the requested line, it didn't work.  Yes, I closed the terminal and opened a new one.  

Now, the soft link works, because `./bin/sage` works.  And the /usr/local/bin version works great.  So this is almost ready.  In some sense, it IS ready - when I change my .profile to include the requested line, it works!  

So I'd just say to change your advice.  See [this apple.stackexchange question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically).

```	
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell.
On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells
(only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). 
This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. –
```

Otherwise this is fine, modulo whatever problems in #11026 that would cause this to need rebasing if that were changed.

That's a good idea.  I've added a patch.
