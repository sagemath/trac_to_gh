```
Using several versions of Sage on several operating systems:

* 4.5.rc0 on OS X (bsd.math)
* 4.5.2 on Linux  (sage.math)
* sage-4.6.alpha3 on OpenSolaris (my machine hawk)

it is possible to crash Sage quite easily with:

```
sage: seed(1,2)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

```

Running under OpenSolaris with gdb, I see:


```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.alpha3$ ./sage -gdb

sage: seed(1,2)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

```

so it looks like the random number generator thats being seeded (or not as the case may be) is part of gmp, and not gsl or anywhere else in Sage that has random number generators. 

Plenty of other arguments to `seed()` can cause Sage to crash too.

I am surprised: Aren't those things supposed to be done in `__cinit__`, so that initialisation of the c-data is granted even if Python initialisation fails?\n\nAnyway, renaming `__init__` into `__cinit__` does not solve the problem.",

So, the latest sage-specific thing is `sage.misc.randstate.randstate.__dealloc__`, which does nothing but

```
         gmp_randclear(self.gmp_state)
```

`self.gmp_state` is initialised in `__init__`. I am surprised: Aren't those things supposed to be done in `__cinit__`, so that initialisation of the c-data is granted even if Python initialisation fails?

Anyway, renaming `__init__` into `__cinit__` does not solve the problem.

Yes, I got it!

The problem is as follows:

* `randstate.__init__` takes exactly one argument `seed` (beside `self`).
* You give it two arguments. Thus, `__init__` fails before being executed.
* After that, `__dealloc__` is called, but the c-data are not initialised, because `__init__` has not beeen executed.

I think the following is a clean solution:

* Add a `__cinit__` method that accepts *any* arguments (so that no error is raised before it is executed).
* Initialise c-data in `__cinit__`
* If calling `__init__` fails, then `__cinit__` has already been executed. Hence, `__dealloc__` works, and thus one just sees the due error, but no segfault.

Preparing a patch now!

The patch applies to 5.0.beta14 and does the trick for me (I tried a variety of bogus inputs).

I'm not sufficiently qualified to verify that Simon's dignosis is correct, though it looks pretty convincing.  I would be slightly happier if the error message did not refer to "__init__" since the user will not have typed that (probably), but that's a minor point.

So, +1 towards a positive review.

I didn't mean anything so complicated.  But I compared for example

```
sage: EllipticCurve([1])
...
ValueError: sequence of coefficients must have length 2 or 5
```
or

```
sage: ZZ(x)
...
TypeError: unable to convert x (=x) to an integer
```
which are similar in so far as they are reporting invalid input to a constructor.  It's not serious (and I certainly do not want to detract from the impressive work you did in tracking this down!).

These examples are totally different, actually. In your example, the functions or methods are called, and then *inside the function/method* the arguments are checked and an error is raised. In my example, Python tests whether the number of arguments is correct, which is not the case, and thus the error is raised *before the method is called*.

More differences:

When you do `EllipticCurve([1])` you are calling a function

```
sage: type(EllipticCurve)
<type 'function'>
```
and the function accepts anything between 1 and 3 arguments. Compare:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(1,2,3,4)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: EllipticCurve() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)
```

When you call `ZZ(x)`, then you are calling the `__call__` method of `ZZ`, which accepts any number of arguments:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(ZZ)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'x', '*args', '**kwds'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=(0,))
```

However, in my example, a class is called. So, that would be something like

```
sage: ZZ.__class__(x)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 0 positional arguments (1 given)
```
