With this patch, it is now possible to set solver-specific options, like a time limit or a ratio of approximation (if you do not want to compute the optimal value, but something 10% away from it)

Seems good so far. But in my sage version (4.7.1) the constructor of MixedIntegerLinearProgram does not use it when given as a backend, since get_solver in the Generic Backend requires a String or None. So we should change to something like 

!__init!__ ....

 if isinstance(solver,GenericBackend):   

  ...

else:

... 

or even better change GenericBackend.get_solver 

if solver is None:

...

elif isinstance(solver,GenericBackend):  

...

elif solver=="Coin":

...

But I may have overlooked something.

The lastest developper's version does not work for me. I have an build issue on ubuntu, so we have to postpone that one.

A short (hopefully better) description of the problem above:
The code online linked in trac is the latest developper's code, is't it?

When we create a new instance of a MixedIntegerLinearProgram (see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/browser/sage/numerical/mip.pyx#L200) like

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True)
```
**, **we call

```
get_solver(solver=solver, constraint_generation=constraint_generation)
```
Then **get_solver**(...) checks for a solver (e.g. CPLEX see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/browser/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx#L90), but the solver is required to be a string, not an instance of a solver.

Since MixedIntegerLinearProgram uses get_solver to obtain a solver, get_solver requires a string in the input, and the backend is hidden in the MixedIntegerLinearProgram, we will never be able to use the solver with special parameters in an instance of MixedIntegerLinearProgramm, e.g:

```
my_solver = get_solver(solver = "CPLEX") 
my_solver.solver_parameter("timelimit", 60)
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver=my_solver)
```
will fail. I do not see this addressed in the patch. 

But I may be mistaken?

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

I have overlooked that method. I am almost fine.

Some minor points in the documentation:

In mip.pyx:1357 you write 

"The solver parameters are by essence solver-specific, which means their meaning heavily depends on the solver used (it is GLPK by default)."

The priority is CPLEX, Coin, GLPK. I guess sage is released with GLPK. Thus it is still right, but we should clarify it or remove the statement about the default solver.

The import of example mip.pyx:1396 uses

```
from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver 
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
p.solver_parameter("timelimit", 60)
```
I think it has to be

```
from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
```

Patch updated ! I modified the sentence about the default solver, but the meaning is the same : "in case of doubt, you are using GLPK" `:-)`

And the MixedIntegerLinearProgram does not need to be imported first, it is always present when working in a Sage terminal.
