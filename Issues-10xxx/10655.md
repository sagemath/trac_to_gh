Pretty much all the optional tests in animate.py are fine to do if you possess ImageMagick and the convert command.  Some of them should really then save to a temp file (in the doctest).  

This ticket is to make sure that all of them have the actual keyword convert so that optional doctesting works, and to fix those temp files.  See #7981 for background.
