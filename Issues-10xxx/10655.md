Pretty much all the optional tests in animate.py are fine to do if you possess ImageMagick and the convert command.  Some of them should really then save to a temp file (in the doctest).  

This ticket is to make sure that all of them have the actual keyword convert so that optional doctesting works, and to fix those temp files.  See #7981 for background.

Umm, the second two doctests might be optional for some reason, but they don't require ImageMagick.  I just tested this by renaming `convert` so that

```
sage -t --only-optional=ImageMagick
```
failed, and those tests did not shows up as ones that failed.  If you look at [the code](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/9ab4ab6e12d0/sage/plot/animate.py#l291), too, it doesn't use anything except the initialization (which doesn't need convert) and `graphics_array`, which clearly doesn't either.

I don't know what you want to do with those, but at any rate this isn't the right solution.  Maybe instead put a little note that these don't require convert or something?

Also, please use a more descriptive commit message.
