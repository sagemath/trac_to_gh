Complex elliptic logs were implemented in #6390 following joint work by John Cremona and Thotsaphon Thongjunthug (as talked about by JC at SD23 in Leiden).  Now the final touches are being put to our joint paper, we found a small simplification to the algorithm, where the iteration now deals with pairs of complex numbers rather than triples.  There is no essential difference except very slightly simpler code, but it is desirable that the code should match the paper in which the algorithm is developed.

Patch up for review: depends on #8820 and #9931.

Note: this should not get a positive review until this example works properly (reported by WAS):

```
K.<w> = QuadraticField(2); K
  E = EllipticCurve([ 0, -1, 1, -3*w -4, 3*w + 4 ])
```
and both elliptic_logarithm and elliptic_exponential take a long time (i.e., don't finish while
I'm waiting).  Is this expected?  I don't understand the complexity, but I sort of thought they would
be nearly instant.

```
embs = K.embeddings(CC)
Lambda = E.period_lattice(embs[0]); Lambda
T = E.simon_two_descent()
P,Q = T[2]
Lambda.elliptic_logarithm(P,10)
```
[wait foreover?]

I have not yet checked that this behaviour still happens after the patch.

I have replaced the patch by one which now works for the reported problem example.  Essentially, I just made the elliptic_logarithm function use my new code in all cases, and adjusted some doctests slightly.
