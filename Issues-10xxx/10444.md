To be precise, make sure the documentation at 

```
sage: x.solve?
```
is available from 

```
sage: solve?
```
There are a lot of keywords people are missing out on.

This patch is based on 4.7.1.alpha2.

However, I see in the patch preview that for some reason there is extra whitespace, so I'll have to take care of that sometime.  For now, needs work for that reason.
