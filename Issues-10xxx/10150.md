This patch renames the add_constraint methods defined in the LP solver interfaces to add_linear_constraint, as Martin wisely requested it.

Apply first :

* #10043
* #10101
* #9698
* #9581

This long list of undeserved dependencies is here to prevent any higher-level patch from having to be rebased, as these patches tend to touch many files almost everywhere.
