FWIW (and for the record) I get slightly different behaviour on an ubuntu 12.04 vbox running on a core duo macbook with 5.1.beta0:


```

sage: for i in range(10):
....:     try:   
....:         print erf(45*10**i).n()
....:     except:
....:         print 'problem'
....:         
1.00000000000000
1.00000000000000
1.00000000000000
problem
problem
problem
problem
problem
problem
problem

```


where the problem is the same Pari (15) error in the ticket.  Pari should certainly be returning 1 here, although any error is certainly better than -1.89139086613300e232327576..

This is an upstream PARI bug.

Here is an example that is closer to (part of) the problem:

Consider `erf(10^i)` where `i=5,6,7`:

```
sage: pari(10**5).erfc()
5.23488067975405 E-4342944825
sage: RR(pari(10**5).erfc())
0.000000000000000
```

looks good!


```
sage: pari(10**6).erfc()
3.15934761259943 E-434294481910
sage: RR(pari(10**6).erfc())
5.64243263573681e124617551
```

there's a bug.

Then,

```
sage: pari(10**7).erfc()
3.70390595226759 E-43429448190333
sage: RR(pari(10**7).erfc())
0.000000000000000
```

looks good again ?!?

If the input is too large, there is an overflow in PARI (the exponent is too large for PARI to represent):

```
sage: pari(10**10).erfc()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/jonesbe/sage/sage-5.0/<ipython console> in <module>()

/Users/jonesbe/sage/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/pari/gen.so in sage.libs.pari.gen._pari_trap (sage/libs/pari/gen.c:49843)()

PariError:  (15)
```

and that's something we should probably address separately.

Might be worth noting that we get a more reasonable result by building a number from the string:


```

sage: pari(10**6).erfc()
3.15934761259943 E-434294481910
sage: RR(pari(10**6).erfc())
5.64243263573681e124617551
sage: RR(str(pari(10**6).erfc()))
0.000000000000000

```

The conversion PARI->RR is a different issue: #13033.
