# Issue 27435: Fix ZeroDivisionError of Polyhedron.center()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27672

Original creator: @kliem

CC:  embray jdemeyer

Keywords: polytopes, polyhedron, center


```
sage: P = Polyhedron().center()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: rational division by zero
```


I think the correct output here should be `None`.

This ticket can be closed, sorry.

I guess I should have really read the docstring.

It is pointed out there, that this will happen.
