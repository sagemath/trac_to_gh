# Issue 23116: Upgrade to gfan 0.6

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-07-02 14:00:15

CC:  dimpase fbissey

gfan 0.6 standalone builds nearly out of the box with clang-check, it is compiled with `-std=c++0x`, meaning no adaptations are necessary for C++11.

http://home.math.au.dk/jensen/software/gfan/gfan0.6.tar.gz

There is a patch at https://github.com/rwst/gfan06/commit/9065546313ed5cdebed005b176d4283d03136516
that fixes `max_align_t` compile errors.

This compiles cleanly with `std=c++11` but fails at least `sage -t --warn-long 42.1 src/sage/rings/polynomial/groebner_fan.py  # 9 doctests failed`

I think we should push more of our makefile changes "upstream". In a more diplomatic fashion if we want it to be picked up by the "real" upstream. But I definitely think we should make our makefile patch unnecessary.

In light of what is happening with `lcalc` in #23341, do `CXXFLAGS` from `spkg-install` get used during the compilation?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-07-02 23:19:53

https://github.com/rwst/gfan06/pull/1 is ready for review for the makefile. I could merge it directly but prefer to submit it to third party scrutiny first.

Yes, after I fixed the previous (0.5) Makefile patch, it couldn't work before because `CXXFLAGS_LOCAL` was set but not used. Note I'm using export in the spkg-install. I couldn't get other ways to work.

```

The last paragraph is output from a print command I inserted.

The second fail in rings follows from this.

All right, so you really see `-std=c++11` in your logs then? I couldn't ever get it to work in #23341 - still thinking about that.

The makefile says

```
# When compiling symmetrictraversal.cpp as any other file, it causes the program to crash in certain situations.
# (compiling with gcc version 4.7.2 and running gfan _tropicaltraverse on a starting cone for Grassmann3_7)
# Either this is a bug in the code or in the compiler. The bug disappears by compiling with -fno-guess-branch-probability
```

but clang doesn't support that, and gcc 4 is ancient...

That's a real pity, but I have to agree. Until we either find that we screwed up somewhere or that clang is the broken thing we'll have to stay with gcc if we want a release now.

Another data point, since rc0 or rc1 I get a SIGFPE when starting `sage -gdb`. I should hunt the exact commit before opening the ticket.

Comment by vbraun created at 2018-04-06 16:59:07

This is probably #25092

See also #25118: gfan fails when compiled with XCode 9.3 on OSX (depending upon CPU, it's OK on Xeons, but is broken on i5/i7)


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-04-11 17:47:54

How about adding `spkg-check` ? There is `make check` way to run tests.

By the way, check out #25118 - there is a fix for the OSX problem, I'm just not 100% sure it's totally safe to just drop that `delete` statement.

Changing status from new to needs_info.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-04-12 12:41:13

this adds spkg-check and the necessary change to the source to fail on failing tests.
Also, the port of #25118 patch for Xcode 6.3.

One problem to sort out: the test `0008PolynomialSetUnion` exhibits a sort of bug, due to output being unsorted, despite `sort` called on it. Does `sort` have another meaning while `spkg-check` is called?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-04-12 15:20:09

The testing bug is most probably in `src/app_test.cpp`, invoked via `./gfan _test` from the Makefile's `check` target, which generates these lines such as

```
...
Running command:"cat <testsuite/0008PolynomialSetUnion/input|./gfan _bases | ./gfan _polynomialsetunion |sort>testsuite/0008Polynomia
lSetUnion/outputNew"
Running command:"cat <testsuite/0009RenderStairCase/input|./gfan _bases --symmetry | ./gfan _renderstaircase -m -w6 -d16>testsuite/00
09RenderStairCase/outputNew"
...
```

and parses the output somehow (yes, in C++ !). I checked the intermediate results of this long chain of `|` for `0008PolynomialSetUnion`, they look OK.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2018-04-13 07:18:34

The testing bug is pretty weird. Basically, there is a C++ test driver, source in `src/app_test.cpp`, invoked via `./gfan _test`, which works on directories (say, `bla`) in `testsuite/`. Each directory contains text files `input`, `output`, `outputNew`, and `commaand`,  and does the following:

 1. reads the template from `command` in `testsuite/bla/`, which looks like `%s _bases | %s _polynomialsetunion |sort`,  

 2. replaces `%s` with `./gfan`, prepends the input by prepending `cat <testsuite/bla/input|`, and output by appending `>testsuite/outputNew`.

 3. executes the resulting chain of shell commands, like `cat <testsuite/bla/input|./gfan _bases | ./gfan _polynomialsetunion |sort>testsuite/bla/outputNew`, via `system()`

 4. compares `output` with `outputNew` for equality; if they are equal, test is successful, otherwise not.

----------------

Now, one of the tests fails, due to `sort` producing a weirdly ordered file: while the output should look like 

```
{
a...
...
b...
...
Q[a,b,c]
```

one gets the 1st line swapped with the last line, i.e.

```
Q[a,b,c]
a...
...
b...
...
{
```


Not all the tests call `sort`, the failing one happens to be the 1st one calling `sort`.

Worst of all, a repeat of the run of the testsuite produces no error, e.g. if I go to the working directory of the package build and run `make check` again, everything works. 

And this does not limit itself to one OS, I see this on Linux (Gentoo and Ubuntu 16.04) and on OSX.

---------------

I really don't know how to fix this properly, or even what possibly can cause this, other than a subtle `bash` (or whatever shell `system()` uses) bug or something like this. Possible ways out I see 

  1. calling testsuite twice in row (trying this in `spkg-check` now)

  2. replacing `./gfan _test` with a script; the input lines are already generated (sans a call to diff, which should not be hard to add)

  3. remove this test

  4. ???

I tried replacing `|sort>...` with `| LC_ALL=C sort>...`, to no avail. Should I instead export LC_ALL in `spkg-check` ?

removed  the link to https://github.com/rwst/gfan06/releases/download/0.6.p0/gfan-0.6.tar.bz2 from the ticket description, as we now use the upstream 0.6.2 (fixed this link too), and the corresponding comment:


Note also that there are two versions of the package `gfanlib` (0.6 and 0.6.2) with changes in 0.6.2 that could be applied equivalently to files in gfan0.6. However, the file names are different!---the prefix `gfanlib_` is replaced by `app_`.

Any idea what's wrong there?

This is with gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9).

Is it something to do with `-lpthread` vs `-pthread` ? It's the 1st time I see this, advice welcome.
