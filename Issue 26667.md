In your email, please also include information about:
- The operating system under which the crash happened: Linux, macOS, Windows,
  other, and which exact version (for example: Ubuntu 16.04.3, macOS 10.13.2,
  Windows 10 Pro), and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit;
macOS 10.12.6, 64-bit

- How Sage was installed: using pip or conda, from [GitHub](GitHub), as part of
  a Docker container, or other, providing more detail if possible;
downloaded sage-8.1-OSX_10.12.6-x86_64.dmg and sage-8.1-OSX_10.12.6-x86_64.app.dmg

- How to reproduce the crash: what exact sequence of instructions can one
  input to get the same crash? Ideally, find a minimal yet complete sequence
  of instructions that yields the crash.
just try to run the thing after download

And does it fail with more recent versions of Sage? Sage 8.1 is a year old.

yep tried everything from v8.1 to 8.4, for OSX 10.11.x and 10.13.x

the reason why I tried v8.1, is because that is the latest available download for OSX v10.12.6
