# Issue 14031: Implements antipode and counit in new_kschur.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14235

Original creator: zabrocki

Original creation time: 2013-03-06 13:06:24

Assignee: Mike Zabrocki

CC:  aschilling saliola chrisjamesberg

Keywords: symmetric functions, antipode

At t=1 the space where the k-Schur functions live is a Hopf algebra but the antipode and counit were never implemented because they were not required.  Ticket #14161 adds a test for the antipode that requires a counit method and so doc tests in new_kschur.py will fail unless these methods are implemented.

Not sure whether to call this a 'defect' or an 'enhancement'.  I am going with the latter.

I also am moving the `coproduct` method from the `ElementMethods` to the `ParentMethods`.

There is a typo here :

```
counit is the constant terms
```

should be

```
counit is the constant term
```

Hey Mike,

I've uploaded a review patch which makes some minor tweaks to the doc. If you're happy with the changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Thanks Travis for coming back to both of these patches.  They long fell off of my radar.
