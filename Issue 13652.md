Keywords: Steenrod algebra

The attached patch introduces a new method `top_class` that computes the highest dimensional basis element of a finite sub algebra of the Steenrod algebra:

   {{{#!python
     sage: SteenrodAlgebra(3,profile=((2,1),(2,2,2,2))).top_class()
     Q_0 Q_1 Q_2 Q_3 P(8,2)
     sage: SteenrodAlgebra(2,profile=(3,2,1),basis='pst').top_class()
     P^0_1 P^0_2 P^1_1 P^0_3 P^1_2 P^2_1
     sage: SteenrodAlgebra(7).top_class()
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     ValueError: the algebra is not finite dimensional
   }}}

I suppose it might be slightly better to define `AM` to just be `SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor', p=p)`: you just need to multiply in it, you don't need to use its profile function. If someone is working with many subalgebras at a single prime, then each call to your version of `AM` will create a new subalgebra, whereas each call to `SteenrodAlgebra(basis='milnor', p=p)` just will only create an instance of the Steenrod algebra the first time through.

Otherwise, this looks good to me.

I have changed the line as you suggested, but also added a cast to self at the end. This is intended to make sure that

```
A.top_class().parent() is A
```

although I don't know if that's important. Anyway, I have also added this as a doctest.

Thanks for looking into this, \\
