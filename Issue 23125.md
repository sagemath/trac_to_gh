Ah ah, sounds like upgraded pandocfilters from 1.3.0 to 1.4.2 fixes the issue.

I had a bunch of recent pandocfilters here and there (in conda envs or ~/.local); presumably one of them was overriding sage's one, which prevented me to reproduce the error.

I will now work on updating sage's pandocfilters spkg.

Vincent, in the mean time, could you upgrade by hand your pandocfilters with:

```
    sage -pip install --upgrade pandocfilters
```


and double check that this indeed fixes the problem for you?

In fact Volker had already put work on upgrading pandocfilters to 1.4.2 in #24484, as a piece of a large still in progress work. So I just had to fetch the diffs from there. I had to fix the checksums though. It should be a trivial merge in #24484 and unlikely to be an additional burden there; nevertheless I asked confirmation to Volker and we should wait for his feedback before getting this merged.
