It would be nice to have a file `repology.txt` for each "spkg",
with the package's name on [repology.org](https://repology.org)
and/or the url for getting information about this package there.

This would save time when adding package information for any
already supported or new distro.

If that sounds interesting, I can add that information.

Good idea. The package name is probably enough

Opened https://github.com/repology/repology-updater/issues/1118 to see if there is interest in adding the [SageMath](SageMath) distribution on repology
