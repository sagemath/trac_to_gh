# Issue 22288: Improper expressions from FriCAS interface

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Symbolic expressions coming from FriCAS are not translated into Sage expressions that can be numerically evaluated:

```
sage: integrate(((-1-3*x)^(-1/2)*(-1+3*x)^(-1/2)),x,algorithm='fricas')
-2/3*atan(1/3*(sqrt(3*x - 1)*sqrt(-3*x - 1) - 1)/x)
sage: _.subs(x==.1)
-2/3*atan(-6.51313067138982 + 3.89412863198815e-16*I)
sage: _.n()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5569

```

Already the second command should have evaluated to a floating point value.

Changing keywords from "" to "FriCAS".

A simpler way to see the bug:

```
sage: fricas(atan(x)).sage() == atan(x)
atan(x) == arctan(x)
```

I don't quite get what's happening.  Is there something wrong with my "a"?

```

I just learned:

```
sage: type(fricas(atan(x)).sage().operator())
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>

sage: type(atan(x).operator())
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_arctan'>

sage: type(fricas(sin(x)).sage().operator())
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'>
```

but I do not know where this `NewSymbolicFunction` thing comes from, and why it only appears for `atan`.

Comment by rws created at 2017-03-08 07:19:06

Interesting. It's the conversion via `SR(string)`.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-03-08 07:27:01

In `calculus/calculus.py:symbolic_expression_from_string()` the `arc` versions are recognized but not the `a` versions.


---

Comment by rws created at 2017-03-08 08:29:36

However if I put these into the global `_augmented` dict (as string/function pairs) the dict will be empty when doctesting via `sage -tp`. Can someone explain this to a Python amateur?

Comment by mantepse created at 2017-03-08 09:59:34

not sure whether the following is helpful:

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import symbol_table
sage: type(symbol_table["functions"]["sin"])
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_sin'>

sage: type(symbol_table["functions"]["asin"])
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>

sage: type(symbol_table["functions"]["arcsin"])
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_arcsin'>
```

Sorry, mistake: in a fresh session we have

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import symbol_table
sage: type(symbol_table["functions"]["asin"])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 type(symbol_table["functions"]["asin"])

KeyError: 'asin'
```

Is it possible that `SR("asin")`, `SR("atan")`, etc. actually are supposed to fail?

I don't know how the "conversion" machinery is supposed to work, but `symbol_table["fricas"]` does contain the correct translations.  For example:

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import symbol_table
sage: symbol_table["fricas"]["asin"]
arcsin

sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_arcsin'>
```


Also, it does seem to be a problem with the fricas interface:

```
sage: type(maxima("asin(x)").sage().operator())
<class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_arcsin'>
sage: type(fricas("asin(x)").sage().operator())
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'>
```


In fact, `maxima_abstract.py:_sage_` contains (skipping the docstring)

```
    def _sage_(self):
        """
        ...
        """
        import sage.calculus.calculus as calculus
        return calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string(self.name(),
                maxima=self.parent())
```

which looks more plausible than the `fricas.py` counterpart (which I wrote...):

```
        from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
        s = unparsed_InputForm
        replacements = [('pi()', 'pi '),
                        ('::Symbol', ' ')]
        for old, new in replacements:
            s = s.replace(old, new)
        try:
            return SR(s)
        except TypeError:
            raise NotImplementedError("The translation of the FriCAS Expression %s to sage is not yet implemented." %s)
```

I'm now pretty much convinced that it is wrongdoing of the FriCAS interface.  An essential step in `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string` is to replace all known functions with their sage equivalent, using `symbol_table`.

So, we should do the following: rewrite `fricas._sage_expression`, which currently takes the `unparsed InputForm` of a FriCAS `Expression Integer` or `OrderedCompletion Expression Integer` object as follows:

* input should be the `InputForm`, instead of the `unparsed InputForm`, which is essentially a nested list of the form `(function arg1 arg2 ...)` (lisp syntax)
* replace function by its sage equivalent, and recurse.

I am unlikely to do that.

Comment by rws created at 2017-03-08 14:16:18

I think your analysis didn't consider the fact that `return SR(s)` in `fricas.py` calls `symbolic_expression_from_string` and therefore `symbolic_expression_from_string` would be the code to fix.


---

Comment by mantepse created at 2017-03-08 14:23:38

Yes, but it shouldn't.  `symbolic_expression_from_string` hopes for expressions in terms of the dictionary `symbol_table["functions"]`, not `symbol_table["fricas"]`.  I didn't know about `symbol_table` when I coded the interface.

This looks great!  I added a test checking that we can use it to compute numerical values, which is probably the most interesting part of the fix.

Unfortunately, I have to recompile almost from scratch.  I'll set it to positive review afterwards.

(most of the `#optional - fricas` tests will fail here, because I made a mistake in #22501, which is fixed in #23782)
