# Issue 19368: Cython hook for extension module metadata

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-11-20 09:25:26

Add a patch to Cython with a cleaner interface for processing the module metadata, such that we no longer need to monkeypatch Cython's `create_extension_list()`.
