The following code fail:


```
sage: K.<xi> = NumberField(x^3-3)
sage: v_fin = tuple(K.primes_above(3))[0]
sage: abs_val(K, v_fin, K(0))
```


It should return 0.

I set this to needs review as it seems it is done, so the patchbots can check it.

The other way to do this would be to ensure that `p^(-Infinity)` returns 0 in some way, but I don't suppose that really matters.

Returning `0` gives an `int` which is of the wrong type, so please change it to `return R.zero()` instead. Moreover, a blank line is needed after `TESTS::` and please remove the trailing whitespace in the line above that. Also enter your full name in the authors field.

I am not too familiar with the theory, so it would be good if someone can confirm this is mathematically correct.
