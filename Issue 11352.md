NP at all.

yes, thanks.

> * I think 'dependence' is the more conventional math noun: 'algebraic independence' and 'algebraic dependence'.


Okay, convinced :)

> * Yes, it would be better to return the entire elimination ideal (did it now), which is what i meant to do initially but got sidetracked into making a tailored version for my bigger project.


Positive review.

I used Sage 4.7 to make the patch. I took your advice and upgraded to sage-4.7.1.alpha2 and retested the patch. The two erroneous lines disappeared. The new patch is up.

Thanks.
