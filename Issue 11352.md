# Issue 11352: Function to test for algebraic dependence of polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11524

Original creator: araichev

Original creation time: 2011-06-21 00:30:49

Assignee: AlexGhitza

CC:  malb

Keywords: algebraic dependence polynomials

Added a function to sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py to return an irreducible annihilating polynomial for the polynomials in `self`, if those polynomials are algebraically dependent. Otherwise it returns 0.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

* Shouldn't `self` be ``self``, i.e. not typeset as mathematics?
 * It would be good to show what the algebraic dependency is, i.e. what the polynomial means, by evaluating it in the doctest. 
 * "NOTES:" should ".. note::" IIRC
 * it would be nice to have a more verbatim commit message, such that reading the logs makes sense
 * wouldn't it be better to return *all* elements of the elimination ideal?

erm, the first line should read: ``self`` and ```self```.

Oh, and isn't it "algebraic dependency"?

Thanks for your help, Martin. I'm a newbie developer, so please bear with me. I incorporated your corrections. 

* I evaluated the annihilating polynomials at ``self`` in the doctest to get 0. Is that what you mean?
* I think 'dependence' is the more conventional math noun: 'algebraic independence' and 'algebraic dependence'.
* Yes, it would be better to return the entire elimination ideal (did it now), which is what i meant to do initially but got sidetracked into making a tailored version for my bigger project.

NP at all.

yes, thanks.

Okay, convinced :)

Positive review.

Your patch has two erroneous lines on top:

```
Detected SAGE64 flag
Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode
```


Please let me know which version of Sage you used to make this patch.  Could you try upgrading to [sage-4.7.1.alpha2](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.7.1.alpha2/), export the patch again and let me know whether the issue persists (it should be fixed)?  In any case, the patch needs to be updated.

Hi jdemeyer:

I used Sage 4.7 to make the patch. I took your advice and upgraded to sage-4.7.1.alpha2 and retested the patch. The two erroneous lines disappeared. The new patch is up.

Thanks.
