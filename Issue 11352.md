Keywords: algebraic dependence polynomials

Added a function to sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py to return an irreducible annihilating polynomial for the polynomials in `self`, if those polynomials are algebraically dependent. Otherwise it returns 0.

yes, thanks.

Okay, convinced :)

Hi jdemeyer:

I used Sage 4.7 to make the patch. I took your advice and upgraded to sage-4.7.1.alpha2 and retested the patch. The two erroneous lines disappeared. The new patch is up.

Thanks.
