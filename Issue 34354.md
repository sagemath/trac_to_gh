At line 3557, the substituted polynomial becomes 0 correctly. But then it goes on "try_symbolic". Why?

Yes. But as I analyzed the bug, there is no problem with Singular. So I suggest to close #34417 as a duplicate, and let us focus on fixing the problem in comment:3.

I don't know why you say there is no problem with singular. As pointed out in ticket:34417#comment:1, the problem seems to arise in `singular_polynomial_call`.

You are right.

But there still seems to be a different issue with `.subs()`. I am investigating.
