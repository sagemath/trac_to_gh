# Issue 3096: [with patch, needs review] Fix documentation rebuild issues for Sage 3.0.1.final

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3096

Assignee: failure

As usual at the end of a release cycle we have to fix some LaTeX issues from the docstring. The upcoming patch fixes the issues for 3.0.1.rc0 for me.

Cheers,

Michael
