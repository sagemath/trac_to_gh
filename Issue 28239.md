with Sage 8.8:

```
sage: R.<y> = QQ[]
sage: T.<z> = R.quotient(y+1)
sage: u = T(91/131)
sage: w = T(-1)
sage: w.norm()
-1
```

How can it be the norm of a polynomial can be negative?

The terminology may be confusing, and the docstring is wrong, but sage is working correctly in this example.

In the theory of finite-dimensional algebras over a field F (including the theory of extension fields), the "norm" of an element is the determinant of the F-linear transformation that is given by multiplication on the right by a. This determinant can certainly be negative. (I don't know why it is called the "norm", but this terminology is absolutely standard in this area of algebra.)

I will upload a PR to fix the docstring, which erroneously says that the norm of a is the *norm* (rather than the *determinant*) of the linear transformation. (I am only changing one word in a docstring, so I don't think the patchbots will find anything to complain about.)
