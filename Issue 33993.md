I did a few edits to reduce the number of compilation errors. However I cannot do more yet as for several variables, I don't know what's the goal of the variables, what it should contain (e.g., array A), it's expected size (e.g., `root_size` is used as a 2 dimensional array but was defined as one dimensional array. The second dimension must be initialized).

So please add more useful comments. May be some variables should be vectors and not arrays, etc.

- The commits contains file `	src/sage/graphs/edge_connectivity.pyx copy` which should not be here.
- may be you should not build your ticket with the data from #34123. We can figure out later how to merge the modifications.
- I don't understand method `G_minus_A`. If I understand well, it does nothing

The good news is that you are able to compile ;)
