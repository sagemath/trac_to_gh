This ticket stands for micro optimizations for small permutation groups. The rationale is to handle the situation where we have a billion of combinatorial objects and need to run through their automorphism groups most of which are trivial or let say, <= 100 elements. An even more concrete application is given by the [admcycles MR 14](https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/merge_requests/14) where there is a tentative to use graph automorphisms from Sage instead of an handmade implementation. It turns out that this is slowing down a lot! For example

```
sage: from admcycles.admcycles import Hyperell
sage: %time H = Hyperell(3)
```

takes 13.5 sec on master but with MR 14 takes 17.4 sec.

The profiling points to
- the constructor `__init__` of `PermutationGroupElement`
- the `.subgroup` method of `PermutationGroupElement`
- the product `p1 * p2` when `p1` is a symmetric group element and `p2` is a permutation group on the same domain
- `__iter__` for `PermutationGroupElement` (that currently involves computing a strong generating scheme)

I agree with Frédéric that adding a whole bunch of `# py2` and `# py3` tags is not a good solution. I am assuming this comes from this change:

```diff
-        return self.iteration(algorithm="SGS")
+        if len(self._gens) == 1:
+            return self._iteration_monogen()
+        elif self.cardinality() <= 100:
+            return self.iteration(algorithm="BFS")
+        else:
+            return self.iteration(algorithm="SGS")
```

and the `BFS` option calls `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, which has consistency problems on Python3 IIRC. So we have to solve that bigger problem first.

I have some other comments:

I don't see the point of going to cycles just to convert back here:

```
return grp.element_class(self.to_cycles(singletons=False), grp, check=False)
```

I know this was already done, but it seems useless as the `PermutationGroupElement` stores things internally as a list in essentially the same way.

I would probably Cythonize `from_cycles`.

Is there a reason why `_set_identity` and `_set_list_images` are `cpdef` and not just `cdef` (which is faster when being called by C code)? By being `cpdef`, they also need doctests.

I don't think that the enumeration order is relevant here. This is convenient for doctests and only shows the weakness of them.
