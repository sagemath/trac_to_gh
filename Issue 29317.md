This is normal functioning of `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` macro.

`matpermanent` is used to detect that `libpari` is at least verision 2.11. First, an attempt is made to link without `-lpari`, adn it fails. The next attempt (line 2107), `-lpari` is added, and test passes.

Thanks for the quick fix.

I started test runs a minute ago: [https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/85835472](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/85835472).
