# Issue 19512: reduced_word_graph on a Coxeter group element fails due to DiGraph ducktyping

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19749

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2015-12-19 07:18:31

CC:  sage-combinat tscrim jipilab ncohen

Keywords: sage-combinat, duck typing, coxeter groups, graphs

See the doctest in the attached branch for one example that is failing.

I have made a few other edits like this, changing a `DiGraph` invocation to one with an explicit `format` parameter. I think we should eventually get them all (except for those where user freedom is intended, but I doubt we want that very often). Unfortunately I don't have the time to go through the whole library with this.

Not sure why you added me in Cc, but what you do is probably the right thing. The Graph constructor is too smart for its own good, and while it can detect its input in most situations there are, as always, corner-cases. I wouldn't be too worried about dictionary inputs, though. Usually they are interpreted right, and a problem with them would raise an exception rather than do silently something you do not expect.
