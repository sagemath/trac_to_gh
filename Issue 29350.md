Me neither. I see two doctest failures:

```
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx", line 2287, in sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend.print_ranges
Failed example:
    p.print_ranges()

    glp_print_ranges: optimal basic solution required
    1
Got:
    1
```

and

```

Failed example:
    res = p.solve()
