I asked on the Homebrew Discourse about opening an issue
for fixing the Homebrew recipe for GLPK:

Anyone else see singular segfaults with this on homebrew? https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/624792671

I do not see those segfaults on my end, using Homebrew's GLPK.

Me neither. I see two doctest failures:

```
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx", line 2287, in sage.numerical.backends.glpk_backend.GLPKBackend.print_ranges
Failed example:
    p.print_ranges()
Expected:
    glp_print_ranges: optimal basic solution required
    1
Got:
    1
```

and

```
File "src/sage/libs/glpk/error.pyx", line 100, in sage.libs.glpk.error.setup_glpk_error_handler
Failed example:
    res = p.solve()
Expected:
          0: obj = ...
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```
