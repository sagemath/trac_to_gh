I am a little puzzles with this implementation. What is a complex reflection group for you?

By definition, it is a subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections. For me, you implement subgroups of the group of colored permutations where the sums of the colors satisfy a certain divisibility.

Also, what about the exceptional complex reflection groups? Shouldn't an class called `ComplexReflectionGroup` be able to initiate any complex reflection group?

typo: `The convenion`

also there is a "degrees" in the doc of codegrees

Otherwise looks good
