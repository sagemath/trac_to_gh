# Issue 25875: Implement finite complex reflection groups G(m,p,n) as permutation groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26112

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2018-08-23 05:53:37

CC:  stumpc5

Keywords: complex reflection group

We can use an m-copy folding of S<sub>n</sub> plus a connector to obtain G(m,1,n) and then an embedding of G(m,p,n) into G(m,1,n) to construct these groups as permutation groups.

Whoops, forgot to change that. Fixed.

I am a little puzzles with this implementation. What is a complex reflection group for you?

By definition, it is a subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections. For me, you implement subgroups of the group of colored permutations where the sums of the colors satisfy a certain divisibility.

Also, what about the exceptional complex reflection groups? Shouldn't an class called `ComplexReflectionGroup` be able to initiate any complex reflection group?

I made it so the API for `ComplexReflectionGroup` explicitly declares it will one day be able to handle an exceptional CRG, but currently raises a `NotImplementedError`.

typo: `The convenion`

also there is a "degrees" in the doc of codegrees

Otherwise looks good
