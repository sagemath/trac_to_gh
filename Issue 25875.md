Keywords: complex reflection group

We can use an m-copy folding of S<sub>n</sub> plus a connector to obtain G(m,1,n) and then an embedding of G(m,p,n) into G(m,1,n) to construct these groups as permutation groups.

I am a little puzzles with this implementation. What is a complex reflection group for you?

By definition, it is a subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections. For me, you implement subgroups of the group of colored permutations where the sums of the colors satisfy a certain divisibility.

Also, what about the exceptional complex reflection groups? Shouldn't an class called `ComplexReflectionGroup` be able to initiate any complex reflection group?

typo: `The convenion`

also there is a "degrees" in the doc of codegrees

Otherwise looks good
