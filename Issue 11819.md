Ahem, what if Sage doesn't start?  Then we get no date...

So you could either do something like

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sage --version | sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;s/[ |]\+$//p'`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```

or, directly,

```sh
echo "[`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`]" \
     "`sed -n -e '/Version/s/^[ |]\+//;/Version/s/[ |]\+$//p' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/sage-banner`." \
    | tee -a "$SAGE_ROOT"/start.log

spkg/pipestatus "sage -c \"print 'Yes, Sage starts.'\" 2>&1" "tee -a '$SAGE_ROOT'/start.log"
```

(`sage --version` is currently broken w.r.t. the removal, so you could actually move the `sed` command to `sage-sage`.)

or use `sage --python -c 'your favourite Python code'` for printing the date and Sage's version (**without** importing `sage.*`).

It is, but note that also `sage/__init__.py` is executed when you import `sage.version`.

This is not a problem right now, but may become one if Sage's import mechanics change (which is work in progress).  You could perhaps modify `PYTHONPATH` and `import version`, but I haven't tried that yet<sup>*</sup>.  Maybe run Sage's Python directly then (instead of `./sage --python ...`).

Well, if you prepend `$SAGE_ROOT/` (which isn't necessary, since we've `cd`'ed to it), then you have to quote `$version` (with double quotes). ;-)

Actually only depends on *one part* (the one to `sage-starts`) *of one patch* ([attachment:ticket:11926:11926_sage_starts.patch]) at #11926.

`sage-starts` could by the way be more robust, i.e., it shouldn't print the following if the current working directory just happens to not be `$SAGE_ROOT`, and `SAGE_ROOT` isn't set.

```sh
$ bin/sage-starts 

Testing that Sage starts...

explaining the problem and send the log file

```


(Also note the logfile's name / location.  The log just contains the time stamp, and left-over files are likely to pollute repositories; only the root repository ignores `*.log` files.

Otherwise **positive review**, since that's not really related to the purpose of this ticket.  Feel free to fix it here (or elsewhere) though.


----

<sup>*</sup> We may add this to the Installation Guide (that one shouldn't put `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/` into `PATH`), but IMHO most scripts there should do the "usual" sanity check, i.e. for example test whether `SAGE_LOCAL` is defined, since most (or at least many) depend on the Sage environment being already set up.

I had exactly the same in mind, although I would just print: *"This script has to be run from the SAGE_ROOT directory or with SAGE_ROOT properly set."*

```

Although we could be a bit more clever and move the test up, i.e.


```sh
if [[ -x "$SAGE_ROOT"/spkg/pipestatus ]]; then
    cd "$SAGE_ROOT"
elif [[ ! -x spkg/pipestatus ]]; then
    # Complain that either SAGE_ROOT isn't set properly (if it's non-empty)
    # or that we're [presumably] in the wrong directory (otherwise).
    exit 1
fi
```
