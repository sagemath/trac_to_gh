CC:  @vbraun

Keywords: libgap

If inside the gap console we type:


```
gap> PrintTo("somefilename","foo");
```

we get the expected result: the file somenamefile is created if it does not exists, and the text "foo" is written to it.

But if we try to do it through libgap:

```
sage: libgap.PrintTo('somefile',"foo")
```

the file is created, but nothing is written to it.

This prevents some gap packages (the ones that communicate with external binaries through temporary files) to work under libgap.
