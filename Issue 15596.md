# Issue 15596: libgap cannot write to temporary files.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15833

Original creator: mmarco

Original creation time: 2014-02-18 15:00:20

CC:  vbraun

Keywords: libgap

If inside the gap console we type:


```
gap> PrintTo("somefilename","foo");
```

we get the expected result: the file somenamefile is created if it does not exists, and the text "foo" is written to it.

But if we try to do it through libgap:

```
sage: libgap.PrintTo('somefile',"foo")
```

the file is created, but nothing is written to it.

This prevents some gap packages (the ones that communicate with external binaries through temporary files) to work under libgap.

This is fixed in the libgap-4.7.4 upgrade #15873. I propose to close this ticket as duplicate.
