David - you are far too fast for me.  I was going to try to clean up my mess.  So I'll review the fix instead.  

On sage-5.0.beta5 these patches both apply and the tests in sage/matrix all pass.  Documentation builds without errors and the `is_normal()` section of `matrix_double_dense.html` looks fine.

I'll run full tests in a minute and then flip to positive review.

Using the sage-5.0.beta10-gcc tarball from #12369, I get a doctest failure on OS X Lion:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/GCC-no-check/sage-5.0.beta10-gcc/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx", line 2843:
    sage: B.is_normal(algorithm='naive', tol=1.0e-34)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
```

If I run this by hand, then even

```
    sage: B.is_normal(algorithm='naive', tol=1.0e-300)
```

returns True.  The matrix `B`:

```
sage: B

If I run `B.is_normal(algorithm='orthonormal', tol=1.0e-16)`, I get `False`.  With `tol=1.0e-15`, I get `True`.

Thanks, John.  Maybe this test is just too clever.  ;-)  It is trying to get a "wrong" answer by using a tolerance that is too strict.  With what I know now about variability across OS'es, I would probably not attempt such a thing again.  We could,

(a) Back it all out and make a fix, or

(b) Make a corrective ticket.

A fix could be

(i) Ditch the test, or

(ii) Keep it in spirit, but switch to the orthonormal version.

Any thoughts on the best way to proceed?

Rob

Hi Rob,

I prefer options (b) (definitely: no need to back this out for a failure on one platform) and (i) (not as definitely: do you think having a test like this is important? I can't tell...).  If you want option (ii), it might be annoying to make sure it passes on all of the different supported architectures.

Thanks, John.

I like (b)(i) as well.  I don't think the test adds much in the way of "software assurance" and was meant to be "educational" for the newbie.  So it shouldn't be missed.   I'll see if I can get to it tonight.
