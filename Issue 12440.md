# Issue 12440: Fix is_unit() in padics so that it is mathematically correct

Keywords: padics is_unit

Consider the following code:

```
sage: R = Qp(5,5)
sage: S.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(R,3)
sage: f=5+x
sage: f**(-1)
5^-1 + O(5^4) + (4*5^-2 + 4*5^-1 + 4 + 4*5 + 4*5^2 + O(5^3))*x + (5^-3 + O(5^2))*x^2 + O(x^3)
sage: f.is_unit()
False
```


This does not make mathematical sense, and the reason for this behavior is that is_unit() in `p`-adics does not return whether a given element can be inverted in its parent ring. Instead, it returns whether the element has valuation zero. Since the function is_unit() is used in generic algorithms (for instance when trying to invert a power series) it should return what its name promises.

I attach a patch with corrected output and doctests.

I think you need to add an explanation in the docstring of `is_unit` explaining why the change has been made, and pointing at the `is_padic_unit` function as a replacement for the old behavior.  Other than that, the patch looks fine in principle, though I need to run the doctests.
