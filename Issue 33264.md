Keywords: spherical harmonics

After #33117, Sage's spherical harmonics agree with those of SymPy, SciPy, Mathematica and Wikipedia. But for odd order m, they contain `sqrt(sin(theta)^2)` terms, which should be simplified to `sin(theta)`, given that the colatitude angle `theta` lies in [0,pi] and hence fulfills `sin(theta)>=0`.
For instance, in Sage 9.6.beta5, we have

```
sage: theta, phi = var('theta phi')
sage: spherical_harmonic(1, 1, theta, phi)
-1/4*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(sin(theta)^2)*e^(I*phi)/sqrt(pi)
```

whereas SymPy version has `sin(theta)` instead of `sqrt(sin(theta)^2)`:

```
sage: from sympy import Ynm
sage: Ynm(1, 1, theta, phi).expand(func=True) 
-sqrt(6)*exp(I*phi)*sin(theta)/(4*sqrt(pi))
```

Here is the fix. Note that I have added some doctests to `_evalf_`, which, strickly speaking, do not pertain to the current ticket. Actually they should have been implemented in the preceding ticket, #33117, for they check the consistency between `_eval_` (implementing the new formulas with the Condon-Shortley phase) and `_evalf_` (where spherical harmonics are evaluated via `mpmath`).
