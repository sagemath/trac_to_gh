You set `mon = R.monomial(*e)` but are not using it!

The test `F != 0` would better be avoided (it triggers a coercion). If applicable, simply use `if not F.is_zero()`.

`return` is not a function but a keyword. As everywhere else in Sage, prefer `return X` to `return(X)`.

Thanks for looking at this. While I was making the changes, it occurred to me that I should early exit if I know there are no invariants of that degree. This exposed a problem with the molien series precision. Fixed those and added an example.

You might want to:
 - add specification to the polynomial ring expected (the number of variables is dimension)
 - check these specifications. Right now, the error is a bit cryptic

```
sage: G = MatrixGroup(SymmetricGroup(5))
sage: R = QQ['x,y']
sage: G.invariants_of_degree(3, R=R)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: tuple key must have same length as ngens
```

That is cryptic. I was relying on the check in Reynolds operator, but I forgot that the creation of the monomial would fail first.

Check/error message added.

typo: `the resultaing invariant`

You claim that the base field might be extended but there is no such example.

I would rather replace `Compute` by `Return` in the one-line description of the doc.
