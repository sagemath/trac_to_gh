Assignee: tscrim

CC:  vbraun dimpase

Keywords: group morphism

We currently have the following:

```
sage: G = groups.matrix.SO(3, 3)
sage: H = groups.matrix.GL(3, 3)
sage: phi = G.hom([H(x) for x in G.gens()])
sage: phi(G.one()).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 3
```

The result of the morphism should be in the codomain `H`.
