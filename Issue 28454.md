I updated Xcode and the build still succeeds. On one of the machines where building was failing, I deleted and reinstalled a bunch of homebrew stuff, and it made no difference. So now I have two machines failing, one succeeding. What can I do to help track this down?

IMHO its a giant pita that homebrew installs stuff in /usr/local, that is where you put stuff that is supposed to be picked up when you compile third-party stuff. Essentially turning each homebrew system into a distinct snowflake. I don't see how we can support that.

Does it build if you rename /usr/local?

Also, are we always talking about gcc? We don't build gcc by default on OSX anyways. The only really pressing issue is building gfortran, since Xcode doesn't come with a fortran compiler.

Good point about gfortran. It builds on the two machines that I can access right now, although gcc fails on one of them. I don't really want to move /usr/local or do similar manipulations, because I don't want to break too many things.
