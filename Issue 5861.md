# Issue 5861: [with patch, needs review] Remove cocoa, four_ti_2, reduce and template interfaces since they do not work/are broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5861

The interfaces 

 * reduce
 * four_ti_2
 * cocoa

never worked. The template has also been useless, so get rid of them.

Cheers,

Michael
