`sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearFunctionsParent` claims to be in the category of vector spaces with basis, but:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram().linear_functions_parent()
sage: p.basis()
AttributeError: 'sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearFunctionsParent_class' object has no attribute '_indices'
```
