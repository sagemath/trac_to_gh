As I have said before, don't use `six.moves.range` in Cython files. It slows down everything.

Note that I am not using this iterator, only as the name of a type.

What else do you propose to get rid of this single XRangeType ?

Does XRangeType still work in cython with python3 ?

Replying to [comment:3 chapoton]:

Whatever you do, without any exceptions: do not use `six.moves.range` in Cython.

Then maybe one should check that it has not yet happened..

And you do not propose another solution..

Just use `xrange` instead of `types.XRangeType`.
