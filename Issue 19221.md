# Issue 19221: Fix Homset for highest weight crystal to crystal morphism

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19458

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-10-22 15:42:29

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat bsalisbury1

We currently have this

```
sage: Binf = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['A',2])
sage: Bi = crystals.elementary.Elementary(Binf.cartan_type(), 1)
sage: tens = Bi.tensor(Binf)
sage: Hom(Binf, tens)
Set of Morphisms from ...
```

but we should create a generic _crystal_ homset, not set morphisms.
