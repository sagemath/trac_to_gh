```

Also could you remove a few of the blanklines after the `subresultants` before `composed_op` just to make it a bit more standardized?

Once these are done/ignored, you can set a positive review.

No, that isn't the problem (this is done in many places in Sage, plus I like the space to differentiate it from other output and to match what Sage does). Actually it comes from:

```
multi_polynomial_element.subresultants
```

missing an `EXAMPLES::`.

Also, one other trivial change in 2 files:

```diff
-subresultants(self, other, variable= None):
+subresultants(self, other, variable=None):
```
