# Issue 22923: Add a library of common helper functions for use in spkg-install

This idea has come up before but not been implemented.  My implementation simply adds a collection of shell functions with names prefixed by `sdh_` for Sage distribution helpers (this is somewhat inspired by, but much simpler than, the `dh_` programs from the `debhelper` package in Debian).

These functions are exported by `sage-spkg`, and so are immediately usable by any `spkg-build`, `spkg-install`, or similar scripts executed from `sage-spkg` (these are still not required to be shell scripts, but as most are having such a library is convenient).

One piece of boilerplate I replaced with a function is the check in most `spkg-install`s for `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  A downside to this is that if the script is run outside the correct environment, then rather than getting a useful error message we just get that `sdh_check_vars` is undefined.  I have two thoughts on this:

1) In general these scripts shouldn't be run directly in the first place.  In the case that they are (such as testing) the person developing the package should have some awareness of the fact that these scripts are being run from `sage-spkg` and assume `sage-env` has been sourced.

2) Most of the time these scripts are run, it's after they've been copied to a temporary build directory for the package.  If nothing else, `sage-spkg` could create a wrapper around these scripts that automatically sets some default assumptions (such as sourcing `sage-env` and the new `sage-dist-helpers`).

In general, though, I think having a library of helper functions will be a big improvement to the consistency and legibility of theses scripts.  

This ticket also updates the `spkg-install` for `patch` for demonstration purposes only.  I don't intend with this to go on a mass rewriting of install scripts, but having this will be helpful for some other work (e.g. #22509, #22510).

    echo >&2 "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"

is to abort when the variable is not defined. A plain `sdh_check_common_vars` does not do that. At least replace it by `sdh_check_common_vars || exit $?` or something like that.

Yes, I already added something like that in #22509, but it might be worth pulling into a separate ticket.  I just added it there because it became increasingly useful.

I see why I'm confused. This needs to be rebased on the final version of #23179.  I don't know why you removed the dependency.  I think it's useful to have listed in the ticket even if the dependency has been completed.

If you intend that `spkg-install` can be run *without* `sage-spkg` (I assume that was part of the intention of #23179), the following should be done in `spkg-install` instead of `sage-spkg`:

```
# Export package information for use from within the scripts.
export PKG_NAME PKG_BASE PKG_VER
```

These could be handled analogously to `SAGE_ROOT` with the values hard-coded in the generated `spkg-install` file.
