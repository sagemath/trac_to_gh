the last remaining problem was the lack of `GC_INIT()` call in the library (something that is apparently not needed on Linux, but the docs
say that that some platforms might need it...)

With https://github.com/miguelmarco/libhomfly/pull/11
it is all fixed, also on the current Sage's GC version on OSX.

One little detail about `GC_INIT()`: it is not needed on the current Boehm GC master at https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc, but is needed on few releases (7.4 and 7.6), as well as on the current Sage's version of GC.

No it builds with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, and all the relevant Sage tests pass, too, on OSX 10.12 as well as on Linux.
