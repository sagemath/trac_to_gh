The options that are available are not documented. See http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot_field.html and see this output:

```
sage: p = plot_vector_field((x, y), (x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), headlength=10, headwidth=10)
sage: p._objects
[PlotField defined by a 20 x 20 vector grid]
sage: P = p._objects[0]
sage: P._allowed_options()
{'color': 'The color of the arrows',
 'headaxislength': 'head length at shaft intersection, default is 4.5',
 'headlength': 'head length as multiple of shaft width, default is 5',
 'headwidth': 'Head width as multiple of shaft width, default is 3',
 'pivot': 'Where the arrow should be placed in relation to the point (tail, middle, tip)',
 'plot_points': 'How many points to use for plotting precision',
 'zorder': 'The layer level in which to draw'}
```
