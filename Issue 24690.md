Among the changed behavior some of them are weird (and perhaps not desirable)

It may be better to wait for the existing arb-related tickets to be merged, in case the upgrade causes doctest failures there...


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2018-03-08 11:11:46

And this is annoying

```
sage: RBF([-infinity,infinity])
nan
```

Could you add them as dependencies?

Yes, but I also wouldn't want to block this ticket if nobody is interested in reviewing the other ones. In any case, the tickets I have in mind are #24314, #24816, #24717, #24626.

Coming late to the party, pynac-0.7.17 (#24838) depends on this because a fix is included.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2018-05-01 19:33:34

Why is #24575 a dependency? That seems to have nothing to do with arb.

Replying to [comment:11 jdemeyer]:

Somehow it does. The Makefile of arb is making use of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and #24575 aimed to change that...

Dependencies are merged now. Anyone working on this?

```

sage -t --warn-long 52.8 src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 52.8 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_complex_arb.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```

Please someone go ahead. I can't work on this until end of June.

One of the remaining doctest failures come from the following.

There is a regression, before:

```
sage: sin(1/RBF(0))*0
0
```

after:

```
sage: sin(1/RBF(0))*0
nan
```

Replying to [comment:19 chapoton]:

That's because of

```
sage: 1/RBF(0)
nan
```

which was infinite before.

Indeed. But what is the semantic of "nan" ? Should we expect `sin(nan)` to be `[+/- 1]` ?

> Should we expect `sin(nan)` to be `[+/- 1]` ?

No. And I think that's more or less the point of the change: sin(1/x) ∈ [-1,1] for all real x close to zero, but returning a finite ball could give the impression that sin(1/x) is analytic at zero (since, for complex balls, finite result ⇒ analytic).

In any case, the resulting enclosure is correct (if coarser than before), and if upstream decided to make that change, I think we should follow along.

FWIW, `nan`/`NaN` always leads to collapse of the expression tree.

I don't think this is a new issue, but I took the occasion to fix it.

`make ptestlong` gives me two failures:

```
File "src/sage/functions/other.py", line 1418, in sage.functions.other.Function_factorial._eval_
Failed example:
    factorial(RBF(2)**64)
Expected:
    [+/- 2.30e+347382171305201370464]
Got:
    [+/- 2.30e+347382171326740403407]

File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_complex_ball_dense.pyx", line 637, in sage.matrix.matrix_complex_ball_dense.Matrix_complex_ball_dense.charpoly
Failed example:
    mat.charpoly(algorithm="hessenberg")
Expected:
    x^5 + ([-1.8 +/- 0.0445])*x^4 + ([0.3 +/- 0.0833])*x^3
    + ([+/- 0.0164])*x^2 + ([+/- 6.01e-4])*x + [+/- 6.97e-6]
Got:
    x^5 + ([-1.8 +/- 0.0445])*x^4 + ([0.3 +/- 0.0828])*x^3 + ([+/- 0.0163])*x^2 + ([+/- 5.95e-4])*x + [+/- 6.83e-6]
```


In the first one, using Stirling's formula confirms the regression:

```
sage: (log(sqrt(2*pi*2^64),10) + log(2^64/e,10)*2^64).n()
3.47382171305201e20
```

If you mark the first test above "known bug", and fix the second then it's positive review from me.

It is not a bug, even if the enclosure is a bit less tight as it used to... I think we should just change the expected output.

ok, I just did that
