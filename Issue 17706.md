Keywords: modular forms hecke triangle

- Subspaces were based on submodule instead of submodule_with_basis,
  so coordinate vectors didn't necessarily correspond to the supplied basis

- Consider denom_factor in rationalize_series

- More general and more robust interpretation of input for rationalize_series and construct_*form

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17943
