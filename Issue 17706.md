# Issue 17706: Bugfixes for modform_hecketriangle: coordinate vectors of subspaces, rationalize_series

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17943

Original creator: jj

Original creation time: 2015-03-12 23:46:30

Keywords: modular forms hecke triangle

- Subspaces were based on submodule instead of submodule_with_basis,
  so coordinate vectors didn't necessarily correspond to the supplied basis

- Consider denom_factor in rationalize_series

- More general and more robust interpretation of input for rationalize_series and construct_*form

There seem to have been changes in sage (with laurent series?) that make things fail now... :(
