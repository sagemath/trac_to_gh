# Issue 25244: Broken link in documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25481

Original creator: @BruceWestbury

Original creation time: 2018-05-31 12:48:16

The link to the first reference on LLT symmetric functions does not work

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/sf/llt.html

The correct link is arxiv:q-alg/9512031

If I knew how to correct the documentation I would do so.

Are you familiar with git ? Have you read the developer guide ?

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/

Short instructions: 

#(1) clone the git repo (git clone)

#(2) modify the file and commit (git commit -a)

#(3) push the git branch here (git push trac HEAD:u/gh-BruceWestbury/branchname)

OK. I don't know which file to modify.

the documentation is build from the source files in src/sage, in this case : 

```
src/sage/combinat/sf/llt.py
```
