In order to do have the generators print like other variables in Sage. So we'd have the following:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x','y','z'], prefix='', bracket=False, string_quotes=False)
sage: C.an_element()
2*x + 2*y + 3*z
```

Thus it matches polynomial rings and other variables in Sage and gives a cleaner output.

Shouldn't

```
sage: M.<a,b,c>=CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ)
```

work too?

+1 on the feature, thanks! I am not super convinced by the option name, but did not manage to come up with something better. Ideas anyone?

This definitely would make sense! Given this is not directly related, this can go in a separate ticket at Travis's convenience.

For the most part, it's handling a `names` argument and I'm currently doing this at the level of the Lie algebra in #14901 (similar for indexed free monoid/group). However this probably is best (and more uniform) to do this in `IndexedGenerators`. This is now #17039, which I will do later today.
