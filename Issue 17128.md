CC:  tscrim vbraun gouezel

It tries to use some MSVCRT thread functions instead of Cygwin's ones and fails at link time because of undefined references.
(And later on numpy fails to build because of the same undefined references.)

I'm unable to build ATLAS with this branch on the latest `develop` + #15015 (after running a `make distclean`). I've attached the build log and I was compiling on a single thread with Win 8 on a Intel quad-core. I also ran a rebase and still got the same error - it stems from a permission denied error in part of ATLAS's source code. Is this an issue with my setup?

The problematic files have suspicious timestamps:

```
...atlconf_misc.c: Timestamp out of range; substituting 2514-05-29 18:53:03.999999999
...atlconf_misc.c' has modification time 15759751875 s in the future
```

and end up with permission errors:

```
...atlconf_misc.c: Permission denied
```

Can you have a closer look at these files in the build directory?

But this has nothing to do with the patch here.
Maybe with our repackaged ATLAS tarball, but that was not changed here.

My stat output looks similar, I'll quickly attach the (start of the) log of the ongoing build.

I am confused: I compiled with SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast, and it compiles fine with and without the patch. Build time multiplied by 10 compared to SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=base, so the flag is taken into account, but it seems from CPU use that the build was using only one core (on a CPU with 4 cores). The build was started with ./sage -f atlas, what else should I do to build it multithreaded and trigger the bug?

Just look in the log and see at the end if it built a shared lib or not.
To detect if not, you can look for "undefined ref".
Or just post your logs here and I'll tell!

I looked at the proper place in my logs. Compilation with SAGE_ATLAS_ARCH=fast
- with the patch, the library is correctly built
- without the patch, it is not built

So, the patch works for me. No problem such as Travis'.
