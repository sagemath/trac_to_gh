As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26950/range-xrange-and-ellipsis-iteration/): `xsrange` claims to return an iterator while it does not provide a `.next()` method when called with Python ints or longs:



```
sage: xsrange(int(42)).next()
AttributeError: 'xrange' object has no attribute 'next'
```


This is because in those cases, it returns an `xrange` object (which is only an iterable).

Hello,

Why `xsrange` should have a `next` method?

```
sage: next(xrange(10))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: xrange object is not an iterator
```

I think that we should keep compatibility between `xsrange` and `xrange`.

This:

```
``.next()`` or a ``.__next__()`` method
```

should be replaced by

```
``.__next__()`` method
```

But even then, I find it a bit confusing that you talk about a `__next__` method and then show two tests not explicitly involving `__next__`
