This is not some general issue where sum fails on all inputs with lower bound != 0, 1.  For example, this is fine:


```
sage: var('n,k')
(n, k)
sage: sum(k, k, 1, n)  
1/2*n^2 + 1/2*n
sage: sum(k, k, 2, n)  
1/2*n^2 + 1/2*n - 1
```


Starting at 2, I guess this should be the answer:

```
sage: (sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, n) - sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, 1))
(n^2 + n)*2^(n - 2) - n
```


The answer seems fine for starting at 3,4, by the way:

```
sage: a = (sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, n) - sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, 2))
sage: b = sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 3, n)
sage: bool(a==b)
True
sage: a = (sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, n) - sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 1, 3))
sage: b = sum (binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 4, n)
sage: bool(a==b)
True
```


This is probably a serious bug in Maxima, since the real work is done by the function

```
sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.sr_sum
```

which just calls maxima in some complicated way.

I am raising the priority since this is a subtle and very serious mathematically incorrect result.   Also, somebody needs to isolate this to a pure-maxima session exhibiting the bug (if it is in maxima!) and report upstream.  I tried for a minute and failed.

It is fixed. (What's a big deal of having access to maxima 5.26? It compiles with ECL supplied with Sage 4.8):

Thus, we need to update maxima spkg to 5.26.

By the way, I never understood why sum() is hardcoded this way in Sage. Sometimes I'd rather use Python's sum(), but I don't know how to do this.

This is off-topic but a good question. It shows people don't think of checking the [python documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/__builtin__.html) for something like this, so perhaps a more prominent pointer is necessary

Here is the evidence (`a` is the matrix from the `matrix/matrix2.pyx`, line 10369,  test, `b` is the exact matrix). The following is with the new spkg: 

```
sage: b=matrix([[1,pi],[100,1/100]])

sage: (a.exp()-b.exp()).norm()

The same computation on Sage 4.8 gives `(a.exp()-b.exp()).norm()` equal to `0.373383533611`

The failure in calculus/desolvers.py is what kept me from upgrading straight to 5.26 (I settled for 5.24 instead).

OK, this will need to be sorted out, and few other things. I am preparing the patch for most other, "trivial", failures, and will post it shortly.

Thanks for preparing the spkg, Dima! My problem was probably that I didn't rebuild ecl first. It works very well now. I think I found the culprit for the desolve problem:

```

(%o6) [(log((2*sqrt(4/x^2)*x^2*sqrt((4*y^4+4*x^2*y^2)/x^2)+8*y^2+4*x^2)/x^2)
        -sqrt(4/x^2)*x*asinh(2*y^2/(x*sqrt(4*y^2)))
        -sqrt(4/x^2)*x*asinh(2*y/sqrt(4*x^2))+sqrt(4/x^2)*x^2)

```

so the problem is that we set "domain: complex" and apparently the behaviour of something there has changed. The assumptions x>0 and y>0 imply that x,y are real (and maxima's assume facility agrees with that), but as we are well aware, assumptions don't get used everywhere. At the very least, it seems that assumptions on variables do not affect all the things that "domain: complex" affects.

This ought to be fixed by that complex/real domain thing described above by nbruin, but I don't know where this should be done.

Should we provide an option to do "domain: real" on the fly?
I don't know the details of the maxima interface, but I imagine this is doable...

It gives deslove() one more optional parameter `domain`, which takes care of this new discrepancy with this ODE.

As far as the Sage patch is concerned, it would be nice to limit the length of code lines to 79 characters.

For example, in sage/symbolic/relation.py you corrected the output but put everything on one line, which is not very readable in 80 char terminals.

The error in f.nintegal() should definitely raise an Error. Letting it output of tuple of reals is wrong. I'll try to locate where this should take place if you have no time or no idea.

oops, OK, I somehow had trouble splitting lines, and thought that the doctests framework doesn't quite allow this.
What is the syntax? Will it just ignore '\n', anywhere ?

Are you saying that this "error code"=6 is a new addition in Maxima, and is not properly handled by the Sage interface?

I think that you can more or less split where there is a space.

You can just copy what used to be done for the previous examples.

I'm not sure that this is new, but:

* Sage used to return a ValueError so I guess that it used to catch a Maxima error and translate it
* So it seems that Maxima's behavior has changed even though the "6" case used to be there, maybe a Maxima expert could tell us why this was decided. Anyhow, your fix might be the right one then...

A last comment, in your modification to desolve() you modify the domain var of Maxima.

So if I use domain=real with your code, then all of Maxima will use domain=real afterwards.

Maybe we'd better set back domain to whatever it was worth before at the end of the computation.

Anyway, isn't there something in Maxima which "knows" that a variable is real after such assumptions ?

If I understand correctly, Maxima and assumptions play weakly together.  They are ignored in a lot of "dummy variable" contexts like solving and integration.  So maybe here too.

Interestingly, our GSL numerical ODE solvers seem to only have real domains (see [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1156/ode_solver-unable-to-convert-to-float), I can't verify this independently), so maybe we could instead just *always* change to `domain:real` for ODE and then convert back when done... these are all hacks, but some hacks are better than others.

For the assumptions, we don't necessarily need maxima to recognize them. If the user tells us that `x>0`, then we should be able to set `domain: real` whether or not maxima is going to use that information.

In simplification, I gather that maxima doesn't really know about real/complex. The docs simply say,


```
Option variable: domain

    Default value: real

    When domain is set to complex, sqrt (x^2) will remain sqrt (x^2) instead of returning abs(x).
```


They used to add,


```
The notion of a "domain" of simplification is still in its infancy, and controls little more than this at the moment. 
```


I think we should leave the default `complex` to be on the safe side. We could strictly improve some things by checking the assumptions, though. There are a few easy cases that we should be able to handle safely:

1. assume(`x`, 'real')
2. assume(`x` > constant)
3. assume(`x` > `y`) (where `y` is known to be real by similar reasoning)
4. et cetera

If all variables in an expression are determined to be real, we can set `domain: real` before asking maxima to do anything with it.

It's just a little weak in its deductions:

```
(%i1) domain: complex;
(%o1)                               complex
(%i2) display2d: false;
(%o2) false

(%i4) assume(x>0);
(%o4) [x > 0]
(%i5) sqrt(x^2);
(%o5) x
(%i6) sqrt(4/x^2);
(%o6) sqrt(4/x^2)
(%i7) domain:real;
(%o7) real
(%i8) sqrt(4/x^2);
(%o8) 2/x
```

It is ingrained now that the calculus maxima runs with `domain: complex`, so if you want to temporarily switch to `domain: real`, you should switch back afterwards. In principle this could play havoc with multiple threads, but maxima is not threadsafe anyway and our signal management isn't compatible with ECL's ideas of dealing with threads either. So, if in `desolve` (conditional on domain="real") we just do:

```
P("load('contrib_ode)")
...
try:
    P("domain: real")
    soln = P(cmd)
finally:
    P("domain: complex")
```

we should be fine (the "try ... finally" should guard that we end up with `domain: complex`). I don't think performance is a concern if we're doing a "load" every time anyway!.

> ideas of dealing with threads either. So, if in `desolve` (conditional on domain="real") we just do: ` P("load('contrib_ode)") ... try: P("domain: real") soln = P(cmd) finally: P("domain: complex") ` we should be fine (the "try ... finally" should guard that we end up with `domain: complex`). I don't think performance is a concern if we're doing a "load" every time anyway!.^^

That's the kind of solution I would propose.

As far as the Maxima instance is concerned, you get it through the ._maxima_().parent() call in nintegral(...) and it happens to be the unique library instance of Maxima (which is currently used for all the calculus stuff). In particular, a call to nintegral should not modify its settings.

To refine Nils answer, Id say that in try we set domain to the option passed and in "finally" we should restore the previous value of domain which could be "real"rather than "complex" if the user decided to change it globally.

To get the previous value something like str(P('domain').strip(' ') would do at the Sage level although this is kind of dirty (and surely slow)

please review the revised patch. I have fixed the formatting problems and removed the `domain` parameter (which I added in the previous version of the patch) from `desolve().`

Instead, I simply call `sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain:real')`
and `sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain:complex')` in the docstest.
This works just as well.

I would rather follow Nils approach and at least include a try/finally statement in cas an error is raised.

Doing so, we're sure not to let the domain set to real after leaving the function because of an error.

Then, you'd better use "P" already present in the code rather than sage.calculus.calculs.maxima so that you're sure to use the same maxima as the one that will be used for solving the equation. Currently it's equivalent, but if something else changes in the future, such a choice will make everything easier.

Finally, on my side, I'd really prefer first to use the option approach you already implemented, and then to bakup the previous value of domain and set it back in the finally statement (rather than setting it to complex all the time).*

If you want to do it more cleanly, you can use


```
def desolve(..., domain='real')
    ...
    olddomain=P.get('domain')
    P.set('domain',domain)
    ...
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        P.set('domain',olddomain)
    ...

```

rather than P('domain :'+str)

And the error handling at the end of nintegral should definitely be reworked.

For example the test "if 'quad_qags' in str(v)" is useless now that Maxima behavior has changed.

Moreover, I'm not sure the "ERROR in srt(err)" can ever be reached now (was it before???).

I could not locate the commit corresponding to this change although I tried a little hard. Maxima source tree is a little obscure for me. This commit should be mentionned in the doc and would help to answer the two above remarks about error handling. Some expert of Maxima is needed for that.

A last question is to know what we do when nintegral returns an error code.

Do we let the situation as is? Or do we raise an error. I would agrre that this should be treated in another ticket, but I also don't think there is a better choice to make. Some discussion should happen.

It fixes the doctest in the same way that deleting the doctest fixes the doctest.

All we have to do to fix *this* ticket is backport simplify_sum.mac:


```
sage: maxima.version()                
'5.24.0'
sage: n,k = var('n,k')                
sage: sum(binomial(n,k)*k^2, k, 2, n) 
1/4*(n^2 + n)*2^n - n
```


If we're going to upgrade maxima after that, we should do it properly, i.e. no regressions.

I saw that commit but I must admit I do not understand whether that actually modified the behavior of Maxima and slatec or not.

My point here is that we should get rid of the now useless lines of  code and if possible document it properly either in the file itself or  in SPKG.txt with a pointer to the corresponding Maxima commit and some  explanation.

Deciding whether the current behavior of letting the user know that  an error occurred through the last value of the tuple (as maxima does)  which is already document, or whether we should actually look at that  value in Sage itself and raise an actual Error accordingly can be done  later (or not, I'll personally live with it as it is).

I really cannot imagine a scenario when one would run several instances of maxima in a totally uncoordinated way. If such a major change was ever to happen, surely a facility to execute a series of maxima commands in a given maxima instance would be available, and could be used then.

That's a good point, regardless. As I said, when working on the previous patch I overlooked a way to set domain by another call to maxima.

As far as I can check, the newly returned solution is valid:

```
sage: y=function('y',x)
sage: sol=(log((2*sqrt(4/x^2)*x^2*sqrt((4*y^4+4*x^2*y^2)/x^2)+8*y^2+4*x^2)/x^2)
....:         -sqrt(4/x^2)*x*asinh(2*y^2/(x*sqrt(4*y^2)))
....:         -sqrt(4/x^2)*x*asinh(2*y/sqrt(4*x^2))+sqrt(4/x^2)*x^2)/(sqrt(4/x^2)*x)
sage: var('DY')
DY
sage: eqn=sol.diff(x).subs_expr(diff(y,x)==DY)
sage: dydx=-eqn.coefficient(DY,0)/eqn.coefficient(DY,1)
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: E=x*dydx-x*sqrt(y^2+x^2)-y
sage: E.factor()
0
```

so I don't think we need to consider maxima 5.26's response a regression in this respect. It is simply returning a different solution than 5.24 did when `domain: complex` is in effect.

About the multiplie maxima instance, there is indeed only one library instance and I don't think that will change in the near future.

But one can instantiate pexpect interfaces (one or multiple one).

So if I'm a little bizarre and want to use such an interface, I'd like it to behave as much as possible as the library one (e.g. doing something like de_max = maxima(de) and then calling desolve on de_max, in that case we'll get a pexpect interface by the parent() call)..

Of course desole is not really implemented to work in that case and in fact it does not seem to do very well right now (it just returns different kinds of NotImplementedError telling that Maxima failed).

As a consequence we might also think of getting rid of the _maxima_() and parent() call and explicitely only use sage.calculus.calculus.maxima instead.

In that case I'll be completely happy with the use of sage.calculus.calculus.maxima for setting the domain.

Setting the domain can be domain with a simple call to set('domain','xxx') as mentioned above.

But I just discovered that we (I?) messed up something when building the library interface.

With the pexpect interface (be sure to actually start it with maxima.start()), one can use maxima.domain directly. This does not work with the library interface.

Of course we can also add a new method on top of that as well.

You're also confusing me now :)

I really do not like and understand how trac treats newline stuff, whence my maybe confusing message above. I'll try to format that one better.

I'll also says a lot a lot of trivialities, but it's to be sure that we all agree on what we want or do not want.

Fisrt, sage.calculus.calculus.maxima('domain: real') does work as intended indeed.

If you think this is not public enough we can add a new method "set_domain" in MaximaAbstract class which does the same thing:


```
def set_domain(self, domain):
    r"""
    Sets the working domain of this Maxima instance to `domain`.
    """
    self('domain : "+domain)

```

or equivalently


```
def set_domain(self, domain):
    r"""
    Sets the working domain of this Maxima instance to `domain`.
    """
    self.set('domain', domain)

```

with some basic doctesting.

In that form I doubt this is really much more useful than calling sage.calculus.calculus.maxima(...).

Maybe you meant a function declared at the top level of sage.calculus.calculus which does the same ?

It's maybe a little more meaningful.

What I meant about the Maxima Library interface bug is that we should be able to access the "domain" variable of Maxima directly as an attribute of the Sage object, so that one could replace the above method by


```
def set_domain(self, domain):
    ...
    self.domain = domain

```

or if its a function in sage.calculus.calculus :


```
def set_domain(domain):
    r"""
    Sets the domain of the Maxima instance used by Sage for calculus to `domain`
    """"
    maxima.domain = domain

```

This works for the pexpect interface but is broken for the library interface.

Indeed, if you read [this thread](http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2008/012975.html) it seems that in maxima 5.16.2 they decided to return the expression in case of error in evaluation and that this decision was reversed, so now they're just reporting the error codes as computed by quadpack. Those error codes are documented in the `sage.calculus.calculus.nintegral` docstring, so probably the lines

```
    #This is just a work around until there is a response to
    #http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2008/012975.html
    if 'quad_qags' in str(v):
        raise ValueError, "Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral to that precision"
```

could just be removed. A workaround is not necessary anymore. If we prefer to raise errors rather than rely on checking error codes, we could do

```
    errorcode_dict = {
        1 : 'too many sub-intervals were done',
        2 : 'excessive roundoff error detected',
        3 : 'extremely bad integrand behavior occurs',
        4 : 'failed to converge',
        5 :  'integral is probably divergent or slowly convergent',
        6 : 'invalid input'} #this def can go outside function
    cond=int(v[3])
    if cond in errorcode_dict:
        raise RuntimeError("Maxima (via quadpack) reports an error:'%s'"%error_code_dict(cond)
    else:
        return float(v[0]), float(v[1]), Integer(v[2]), Integer(v[3])
```

However, once you start changing things like that, we should perhaps change the return value format (or make it a parameter 'raise_errors_rather_than_return_error_codes').

I read in Nils' latest comment that there are no useless lines to remove, right? Regarding the documentation, how about adding
the following to the patch:

```

Im currently looking at Maxima's code and am not yet convinced of what changed in the last version.

There' indeed the possibility that an error get raised by Maxima (handler ... error stuff) if some values cannot be converted to floats float-or-lose stuff).

In this case Maxima returns the partially evaluated expression.

But that does not explain why Maxima now returns (0,0,0,6) rather than the old unevaluated expression for integrating x with a crazy expression. I'm currently looking at dqags.lisp but did not find anything meaningful yet.

In particular, it also makes me wonder whether the message of the Sage error (for the "workaround", but also for the earlier try/catch stuff) is meaningful.

Will it ever be related to precision problems ? because Maxima seems not to complain any more.

and as I said earlier, returning Error ourselves when when detect that the last value of the tuple and as Nils proposes to do, seems a good idea to me, but should be done later. I'd just like to actually reflect what Maxima tells at the Sage level even though the end user still has to check this last value for a moment.

OK, this poking around in maxima's source is really quite unproductive, but I think I have located the source of the change in behaviour. With maxima 5.26, observe:

```
sage: x.nintegrate(x,0,1,1e-14)
(0.0, 0.0, 0, 6)
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: ecl_eval("(setf f2cl-lib::*stop-signals-error-p* T)")
<ECL: T>
sage: x.nintegrate(x,0,1,1e-14)
ValueError: Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral to that precision
```

whereas with maxima 5.23.2 we have the opposite:

```
sage: x.nintegrate(x,0,1,1e-14)
ValueError: Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral to that precision
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: ecl_eval("(setf f2cl-lib::*stop-signals-error-p* T)")
<ECL: T>
sage: x.nintegrate(x,0,1,1e-14)
(0.0, 0.0, 0, 6)
```

I think [this commit](http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=commitdiff;h=9067349233cc217786983b07c23a2b78cf7d27bc) is responsible]:

```
 (defun stop (&optional arg)
   (when arg
     (format cl::*error-output* "~A~%" arg))
-  (unless *stop-signals-error-p*
+  (when *stop-signals-error-p*
     (cerror "Continue anyway" "STOP reached")))
```

In later commits, the following is added:

```
+;;; Revision 1.116  2011/02/20 20:51:04  rtoy
+;;; Oops.  STOP should signal an error if *STOP-SIGNALS-ERROR-P* is

```

so I think the maxima 5.26 behaviour is as intended. I think you can give Dima's patch a positive review now. Everything is explained and any improvements should be handled on future tickets.

No, you already noted yourself that a failure to convert to float can trigger this:

```
sage: var('n')
sage: x.nintegrate(x,0,n)
...
--> 712         raise ValueError, "Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral to that precision"
...
ValueError: Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral to that precision
```

that's why I said before that this check is necessary.

As soon as we agree on this last point, I'll be happy to provide a  reviewer patch fixing some formatting problems (spaces at end of lines  and stuff like that) and give the ticket a positive review.

To be clear about the domain stuff, I don't think we really need an  additional "public" method to set it, fixing the maxima library  interface so that sage.calculus.calculus.maxima.domain works as intended  (ie can be read and assigned directly) seems enough for me.

Yes, you're right. Agreed. In fact, I expect that any precision problems will always be reported via the error code, so they will *never* come out as an error or an unevaluated call. This only happened before because fortan's "STOP" raised an error, which it doesn't do now anymore.

That also makes me think that the body should be

```
    v = ex._maxima_().quad_qags(x, a, b,
                                epsrel=desired_relative_error,

    #If an error gets raised during evaluation, maxima just returns the unevaluated expression
    #we raise an error instead
    if 'quad_qags' in str(v):
        raise ValueError, "Maxima (via quadpack) cannot compute the integral"
    return float(v[0]), float(v[1]), Integer(v[2]), Integer(v[3])
```

i.e., just let `quad_qags` raise its own errors instead of masking it with a blanket error message. Presently we are not aware of any error that would get raised under normal operation in there anyway, so we would want to know what went wrong.

I'm in the process of fixing some formatting issues (from my point of view) in Sage source tree and in the SPKG itself.

Two remarks:

- I bumped the version number to 5.26.0.p0 because we use a patch on top of 5.26.0

- there is no spk-check although maxima provides a test suite.

I quickly looked for a good reason why there is no such file and could not yet locate one.

Therefore, I'm currently testing "make check" and I got one failure in rtest8 related to some quad_qawf not getting evaluated (this smells like an integration issue like above).

This gives me 1 test failed out of 9,121 in 360 secs (and it does not return an error at the console level...)

Can someone reproduce that failure with SPKG_CHECK=yes and the updated spkg at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/maxima-5.26.0.p0.spkg

Sorry, there is a "sage" missing between flori and maxima...

So it is http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/maxima-5.26.0.p0.spkg

Correct; the Maxima list is always full of minor failures in their (very large, I believe) test suite.  This shouldn't necessarily hold up positive review, because it is quite dependent on the Lisp, if I recall from reading those messages.

Ok, I'll split the addition of the spkg-check.

Nils, could you have a look at my "reviewer" patch (that I'll upload in a minute for the sage tree, you can already look at the mercurial log for the spkg, ignoring the last commit for the spkg-check).

I got rid of a lot of "useless" spaces, jsut want to be sure every one is happy with that.

I usually do not do it, especially so many lines at a time, but my reviewer patch was all about removing some white spaces reintroduced by Dima, and split some overlongish lines (that's another tricky choice, I can leave with long lines, but it's much more readable in a terminal without them and according to our coding guidelines we should stick  to 79 chars at max...).

So I chose to suppress them this time.

IIRC there was a discussion some time ago on sae-devel about make a one time huge patch for suppressing spaces but some people, especially among sage-combinat, raised the problem that it would break patch queues and that we should rather ensure that no such new lines where added and fix for previous spaces made locally.

I hope my choice won't break anything.

Anyway, good that this ticket is finally positively reviewed.

I'll provide a patch asap of course, that's basically trailing whitespaces (e.g. last lines of your patch) in your lines and too long lines (e.g. first line of your patch) and wrong indentation for some doc (e.g. first line of your patch).

It's just that the current patch do not apply on 4.8 and as compiling atlas on my computer takes ages and installing properly atlas on my debian seems broken...

More seriously, you also removed the lines 

"Also, there are limits to the precision to which Maxima can compute..."

I agree that we do not raise an error anymore, but Maxima can still not compute up to that precision.

You also left the stuff about waiting for an answer on Maxima's list, but IIRC there has been an answer there, so what is done is not really a workaround, but rather a decision from Sage developpers.

Last questions (I hope):

About the lines patched in wester.py, why did you add a semi-colon after "n=var('n')" ?

And what do you mean exactly by "Maxima 5.26 does not do "just" simpify() here." (sic)?

That now Maxima cannot simplify this expression when it is only told that Re(x) >0 and Re(y)>0 and that we have to call simplify_exp() instead ?

I just check that this is indeed the case now and was not with Maxima's 5.24.0.p0 (ok this could be simply deduced from the doctest changes).

Is this a decision from Maxima's developers or a bug introduced recently? if the former holds a pointer to where the change was made would be welcome; if the latter holds, this should be reported upstream.

I guess that this is related to the domain stuff, because setting domain back to real answer right away.

And it's strange that the assumptions is not needed anymore.

In fact looking into the simplify_exp code shows that maxima.eval('domain: real$') is called before calling the radcan method which actually  simplifies the expression.

In particular, this might actually be a Maxima regression.

I agree that this is a Maxima regression. First maxima could verify an equality given sufficient information, and now it can't. Assuming everything in sight is real is not the same as assuming some real parts are positive (although who knows what awful bug had as a side-effect this particular equality got verified).

If you look in the history of `simp.lisp` you'll see there is some recent probably relevant work there, so I think reporting this issue might have a chance of getting it fixed (and will certainly be appreciated). 

We are at the mercy of Maxima for these issues. Our alternatives are:
- not upgrade and live with existing bugs
- live with the regression
- fix and patch maxima
I think in this case, Option 2 is the practical one. Option 3 is obviously the best (both for Maxima and for Sage) but doesn't solve anything _now_.

As soon as Dima has commented, back to positive review!
