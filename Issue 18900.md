CC:  @mezzarobba

Use the recently implemented `inverse_series_trunc` for polynomials (#19005) to inverse power series.

We also fix the following bug

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x-1).inverse_series_trunc(10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: constant term -1 is not a unit
```

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19137
