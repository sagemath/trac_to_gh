Many people install a sage binary and want to do some development on *python* only code, but they can't because "sage -b" laughs in their face.  Fix this.

For the hacker, this can be accomplished with two changes:


```
d-69-91-158-223:sage Starx$ cd local/bin/
d-69-91-158-223:bin Starx$ hg diff
diff --git a/sage-build b/sage-build
--- a/sage-build
+++ b/sage-build
`@``@` -36,7 +36,7 `@``@`
       if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
 	  echo "ERROR: There was an error building c_lib."
 	  echo ""
-	  exit 1
+	  #exit 1
       fi
       cd "$CUR"
```


and


```
d-69-91-158-223:sage Starx$ pwd
/Users/Starx/sage/devel/sage
d-69-91-158-223:sage Starx$ hg diff
diff --git a/setup.py b/setup.py
--- a/setup.py
+++ b/setup.py
`@``@` -94,6 +94,7 `@``@`
 
 sage.ext.gen_interpreters.rebuild(SAGE_DEVEL + '/sage/sage/ext/interpreters')
 ext_modules = ext_modules + sage.ext.gen_interpreters.modules
+ext_modules = []

```


The second one completely turns off Cython during "sage -b".
