Big -1 on the (current) doctests as it is one more thing to update each time we add something to the respective catalog. I'm essentially in favor of removing them altogether. If you really want a doctest, then you're better checking if, e.g., `'absolute_import' in dir(crystals)`. I feel such a doctest, which is not there for all catalogs, is just going to create extra headaches.

It would! But I have no idea how to implement it.

Maybe it's not so simple after all.  It seems there's nothing like that currently in Sage, and scant documentation on how to customize tab-completion in IPython (though it does appear to be possible).  Maybe something worth working on (another possibility is that if we provide our own SageModule class, as I've been meaning to do anyways, we can customize `__dir__` for modules in Sage).

In the meantime, this is just limited to some "catalog" modules where it matters most so that's fine.
