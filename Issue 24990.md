I rebase the implementation to 9.1.beta5 and insert a dependency to ticket #29266 which fixes a bug of #26421, since the latter one cause one of the doctest to fail.


Note, that the following doctests of the present ticket already worked under the previous stable release 8.1:


```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 8.1, Release Date: 2017-12-07                     │
│ Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        │
│ Type "help()" for help.                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: S.<t> = QQ[]
sage: R.<x> = S[]
sage: f = t*x
sage: f.is_irreducible()
False
sage: f = t*x + (t+1)
sage: f.is_irreducible()
True
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = 2*x
sage: f.is_irreducible()
False
sage: f = 2*x + 3
sage: f.is_irreducible()
True
sage:
```



Therefore, they don't make clear what is improved by the corresponding implementation. I would replace these doctests by examples which don't work without the implementation of the ticket.
