Keywords: differentiable manifold, tensor field, vector field, differential form

This ticket implements tensor fields (among which vector fields and differential forms) on differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #18783 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). As in #18783, the topological field K over which the differentiable manifold is defined is generic (with sufficient structure to define differentiability, e.g. a complete metric field), although in most applications, K=**R** or K=**C**.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:

1/ Parent classes:
- `VectorFieldModule`: module of vector fields on a differentiable manifold
- `VectorFieldFreeModule`: free module of vector fields on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldModule`: module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldFreeModule`: free module of tensor fields of a given type (k,l) on a parallelizable
  differentiable manifold
- `DiffFormModule`: module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a differentiable
  manifold
- `DiffFormFreeModule`: free module of differential forms of a given degree p (p-forms) on a
  parallelizable differentiable manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldGroup`: general linear group of the module of vector fields on a differentiable
  manifold
- `AutomorphismFieldParalGroup`: general linear group of the free module of vector fields on a 
  parallelizable differentiable manifold

2/ Element classes:

- `TensorField`: tensor field on a differentiable manifold
  - `VectorField`: vector field on a differentiable manifold
  - `DiffForm`: p-form on differentiable manifold
  - `AutomorphismField`: field of tangent-space automorphisms on a differentiable manifold
- `TensorFieldParal`: tensor field on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `VectorFieldParal`: vector field on a parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `DiffFormParal`: p-form on parallelizable differentiable manifold
  - `AutomorphismFieldParal`: field of tangent-space automorphisms on a parallelizable differentiable
    manifold

3/ Other classes:

- `VectorFrame`: vector frame on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordFrame`: coordinate vector frame on a differentiable manifold
- `CoFrame`: coframe (frame of 1-forms) on a differentiable manifold
  - `CoordCoFrame`: coordinate coframe on a differentiable manifold

    "body": "Okay, here's the first round. Overall, the code looks okay, but I haven't check things in detail yet. I've made my way through most of the doc; there are likely some other doc fixes that I will need to do, but I've done a fair bit of clean-up. However, there are some issues:\n\n- To run the tests on `tensorfield.py` takes ~172 seconds (that is after marking a bunch of them as `# long time`). This is too long IMO, and we need to either find a way to speed things up or simplify the tests somehow (smaller manifolds perhaps?) so they don't take so long. One or two non-trivial top-level examples are good. For the doctests, it just needs to be small examples showing the functionality. For any more complicated examples needed to do a more complete test should either be relatively small (in terms of number of lines) and be marked as `# long time` or you need to have a separate file with the complete examples where most (all?) tests are marked as `# long time`.\n\n- I'm not sure about importing `xder` into the global namespace. `exterior_derivative` I am okay with since it is explicit, but `xder` is not a descriptive name IMO. If you want it, then you can import it in your `init.sage` file (in the `~/.sage` folder).\n\n- I added some long versions of each of the names. It is good to at least have the long name. I actually changed `exterior_der` to `exterior_derivative`.

Okay, here's the first round. Overall, the code looks okay, but I haven't check things in detail yet. I've made my way through most of the doc; there are likely some other doc fixes that I will need to do, but I've done a fair bit of clean-up. However, there are some issues:

- To run the tests on `tensorfield.py` takes ~172 seconds (that is after marking a bunch of them as `# long time`). This is too long IMO, and we need to either find a way to speed things up or simplify the tests somehow (smaller manifolds perhaps?) so they don't take so long. One or two non-trivial top-level examples are good. For the doctests, it just needs to be small examples showing the functionality. For any more complicated examples needed to do a more complete test should either be relatively small (in terms of number of lines) and be marked as `# long time` or you need to have a separate file with the complete examples where most (all?) tests are marked as `# long time`.

- I'm not sure about importing `xder` into the global namespace. `exterior_derivative` I am okay with since it is explicit, but `xder` is not a descriptive name IMO. If you want it, then you can import it in your `init.sage` file (in the `~/.sage` folder).

- I added some long versions of each of the names. It is good to at least have the long name. I actually changed `exterior_der` to `exterior_derivative`. I am not opposed to having an alias to `xder` though.

We currently have no `differential` function, just its shorten `diff`, which is the Sage equivalent for `derivative`.

This is what the `init.sage` is for. It is called every time Sage is loaded. I feel that one import to setup an environment with a convenience function is very little to ask. IMO, it is not good for the entry point `Manifold` to have side effects.

What about the SageMathCloud? It's certainly technically possible to define some `init.sage` there, but one has to open a terminal and edit a file, etc.

Also a drawback of `init.sage` is that your worksheets cannot easily be shared with somebody else, or made publicly available for repeating the calculation.

What about `Manifold.import_convenience_functions(verbose=True)` or something like this? It could 
(i) put functions like `xder` in the global namespace and (ii) print out the list of such functions if `verbose` is `True`.

For SMC worksheets, you can easily have the setup in an `%auto` block.

That is no different than doing a usual import. I guess a question that I have is how many such functions do you think there will eventually be?

> - To run the tests on `tensorfield.py` takes ~172 seconds (that is after marking a bunch of them as `# long time`). This is too long IMO, and we need to either find a way to speed things up or simplify the tests somehow (smaller manifolds perhaps?) so they don't take so long. One or two non-trivial top-level examples are good. For the doctests, it just needs to be small examples showing the functionality. For any more complicated examples needed to do a more complete test should either be relatively small (in terms of number of lines) and be marked as `# long time` or you need to have a separate file with the complete examples where most (all?) tests are marked as `# long time`.

By selecting simpler examples, the last commit decreases by a factor ~2 the doctest time of `tensorfield.py`. It's difficult to go below this because the manifold dimension is already at its minimum (for a non-parallelizable manifold): it is 2 for all tests.

`xder` is no longer in the global namespace. I've also suppressed `exterior_derivative`, but maybe we can restore the latter, as you suggest.

In the same spirit, I have renamed `lie_der` to `lie_derivative` and set `lie_der` as an alias to it.

Actually `_rmul_` is already implemented in tensor fields and handles the scalar action. The current `__mul__` handles mostly the tensor product. Since this is an external operation (w.r.t. the parent module), I am not sure that it can be changed to some single underscore method within the coercion framework. Note that we already had `__mul__` for handling tensor products in ` sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor`.

Thank you very much for your review and the changes in the code!

I've committed a few minor changes: besides fixing some documentation error (missing blank line),
- this reverts to the previous version of comparison to zero in `TensorField.__eq__`: indeed the following code in commit 7cf4ff4 

```
 if other == 0:
     return self.is_zero()
 elif other in ZZ:
     return False
```

  could return True for `a == b` with `a` being a zero vector, say, and `b` being a zero 2-form. We do not want this behavior, do we? We should only allow for the possibility to write `a == 0` as a shortcut for `a.is_zero()`.

I'm okay with your changes modulo the straight revert to this `isinstance(other, (int, Integer))`. What if `other = QQ.zero()`? A better check (if slightly more in terms of time) is `other in ZZ`:

```
sage: vector([0,0,0]) == 0

False
