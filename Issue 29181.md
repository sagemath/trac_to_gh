> From what I understand this is a problem that only occurs when one has python3 from Xcode. This doesn't ship certify and never will (at least Apple doesn't have any intentions). So it is really difficult to establish an ssl connection with that.

That's a correct description for macOS. But the problem also appears on Linux distributions if one does not install ca-certificates, or those are outdated.

> Do you have successfully tested this ticket?

Yes, I have been using this as part of #29417 since end of March. 

> Do I understand correctly that the problem occurring could be theoretically fixed by manually downloading the correct packages into the upstream folder? (Yes this is not a good approach for testing environments.)

That's correct for the macOS tests using `tox local`. For the Linux tests with `tox docker` note that `/upstream` is in `.gitignore` (therefore in `.dockerignore`) and is therefore not provided to the container.

> Also this flag would never be needed for a normal user as long as the sage mirrors don't use ssl?

That's right, normal users would not use the `upstream_url` at all; it is a feature for developers only.
