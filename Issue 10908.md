The $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-update script should allow upgrading between alphas.

There should be a way to tell it to avoid pointless merges between released alphas and their equivalent, build-milestone alphas inside newer alphas, for those of us who don't want or need anything to be merged. Since alphas are currently released based on the previous stable release rather than the previous alpha, there could be an option (maybe even a default) to strip the old alpha's branch from the stable version after installing the new alpha. There is a general procedure I currently follow to move all my patches from old alphas to new alphas which could be automated as well.

I marked this as a defect as I think it seems reasonable to expect `sage -upgrade` to be able to do stuff like this (or at least be usable for upgrading between alphas), but if you disagree, feel free to change it to a feature request.

Given the change to git, I think this should probably be closed.

Changing to git did not make this go away, oddly.  However, [this recent commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/1f274351a18de73d96eb67052fe49b2765de54ea) by vbraun does fix the issue, as far as I can tell.
