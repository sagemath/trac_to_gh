It would be worth making sure this really is a change we need to make.  Can the original reporter explain why one is more appropriate than the other in terms of Sphinx doc for [topic](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#topic) and [rubric](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#rubric)?  Just to make sure :)

Removing the "beginner" tag from old tickets. Some could be returned to beginner-friendly status by adding a comment about what needs to be done. Some others might be easy for an experienced developer to finish.

All occurrences of "topic" in `src/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py` were changed to "rubric" long ago.  (Git blame says it was in 2011 and 2012.)  So there is no longer an issue here.

Changing status from needs_info to positive_review.

Two instances of `topic` were changed to `rubric` in #12645.

Two instances of `RUBRIC` were introduced in #11935.

Are both `rubric` and `RUBRIC` ok? Should we homogenize?

Changing priority from minor to trivial.

Changing type from defect to enhancement.

Yes, you are right, so this PR homogenizes to `RUBRIC:`.  A quick search of the src directory found 98 occurrences of `rubric:` (in 25 files) and 116 occurrences of `RUBRIC:` (in 44 files), but this seemed to be the only file that had both.  (Also, I think that all of the other occurrences of `<keyword>::` in this file are all caps.)  Thanks for the suggestion.

Thanks for the review!

The Sphinx documentation has the "rubric" directive in lowercase:

- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html

Not sure if we have a different tradition.

That can be a different ticket anyway
given the numerous occurrences across our sources.
