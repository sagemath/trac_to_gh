Can you use `sage.misc.temporary_file.tmp_filename` for temporary files? Hardcoding a file in a publicly-writeable directory is almost always a security hole:

```
  sage: p.solver_parameter("LogFile", "/tmp/logfile.log")   # optional - Gurobi 
```

Hmmmmm... It's really just a doctest, and nothing is actually written there. I don't even have to put a path that makes sense.

If you just want a nonsensical path then use something like `/dev/null`. The examples should demonstrate best practices, not how to shoot yourself into your foot if you follow them.
