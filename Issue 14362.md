Can you use `sage.misc.temporary_file.tmp_filename` for temporary files? Hardcoding a file in a publicly-writeable directory is almost always a security hole:

```
  sage: p.solver_parameter("LogFile", "/tmp/logfile.log")   # optional - Gurobi 
```

Hmmmmm... It's really just a doctest, and nothing is actually written there. I don't even have to put a path that makes sense.

If you just want a nonsensical path then use something like `/dev/null`. The examples should demonstrate best practices, not how to shoot yourself into your foot if you follow them.

`O_o`

I am totally free to write something to "/tmp/log" on my own computer, am I ? I often do that ! `O_o`

Thats fine if you do it on your own personal computer, but if you do it on a multiuser system then some sneaky guy might have created a symlink `/tmp/log` -> `/home/ncohen/important_file` before you write to it....

Oh. I hadn't thought of that `O_o`

Fixed !

Looks good to me

I noticed that #12973 is languishing, maybe you want to pick that one up? ;-)

What the hell is wrong with #12973 ? Looks like I set my name as the author but I was not the one who wrote the original patch. Even though both files have been uploaded by me `O_o`

Looks like I did some modifications to the author's patch, then uploaded a short reviewer's patch. I just set the names right, and checked that it still applies on the current dev version. If you have a couple of minutes to waste, would you be willing to give it a final check ? Looks like this patch would have been forgotten forever if not for you `^^;`
