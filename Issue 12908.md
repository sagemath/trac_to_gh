The PDF documentation doesn't build:

```
! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \K

l.18156 absolute Galois group of $\K
                                    $. As $n$ varies
?
! Emergency stop.
<recently read> \K

Fixed. The PDF and HTML documentation build now.

I've also fixed the typos in the comments pointed out by Tony in his review.
