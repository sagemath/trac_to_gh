I am glad to see this, because there are several open tickets on these topics. Other tickets I noticed that seem to fit the description and I hope will be included in the organization: #29431, #29422, #29346, #29336, #29309, #27934, #27564, #27540, #27506.

You are right, some of them must be finalized, some other closed.

For #27564, we may implement a Tree class like `BipartiteGraph` and to add it specific methods. This could help organizing methods.
