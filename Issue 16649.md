The code looks good to me.  Here are just a few remarks about the documentation (sorry that this is longer than the documentation itself...):
- The first line should be a short description of what the function does.
- The usual format for documenting argument lists has `--` instead of `:`, e.g.

```
- ``x`` -- prime ideal factorization
```

- A typo: `elementbb` -> `element b`
- Use single backquotes around formulae so they are LaTeXed in the HTML and PDF documentation, and use LaTeX macros like `\ge` instead of `>=`.
- Maybe it is useful to mention the ambient number field somewhere...
