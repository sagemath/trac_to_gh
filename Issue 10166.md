# Issue 10166: three new methods in Poset

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: poset

1) I need the distributive lattice of order ideals of a poset:


```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().order_ideals_lattice() 
```


2) I need the poset of join irreducibles of a lattice:


```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().join_irreducibles_poset()
```


3) The Coxeter tranformation of a poset is a matrix, defined using the order matrix and its inverse, which is useful in the study of the derived category attached to the poset.


```
sage: Posets.PentagonPoset().coxeter_transformation()
```


My procedure for the distributive lattice seems to be broken right now. N. Thiery has a procedure for the poset of join irreducibles. I have a working procedure for the Coxeter transformation.

Hello !

Could you rebase your patch on the current release ? It fails to apply on rc1. After that, I think the review should go fast `:-)`
