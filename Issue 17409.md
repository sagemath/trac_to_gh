# Issue 17409: Documentation and default of Graph.show(method="js")

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17646

It has been reported [1] that the default behaviour of `show(method="js")` was not the same as `show()` when it comes to displaying the vertex labels.

This branch fixes it, and simplifies the doc.

That's an easy patch that is perfectly working (functionality and doc).
Thanks Nathann.
