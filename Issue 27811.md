# Issue 27811: fix gap workspace name on Python3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28048

Keywords: python3 gap

hash of strings on Python3 depends on the session. As a consequence, when used with Python3 a gap workspace is created at each session and populates `DOT_SAGE/.gap` with a new workspace at each session. The ticket fixes the name by using `hashlib` instead.
