# Issue 12060: Simple Server API - Interrupt Behavior

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mmanashirov

Original creation time: 2011-12-24 22:52:08

Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

I'm not sure if this is working as intended but in its current form the interrupt command interrupts the entire worksheet with no option to interrupt a particular cell. This can be a problem if you have a steady stream of computations on the queue and you only need to interrupt one of them. I suggest that the interrupt command accept an optional cell argument to indicate that a specific cell is to be interrupted; otherwise interrupt the worksheet to remain consistent with the current behavior.

Suggested changes to interrupt behavior.

Attachment

The `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb` that is shipped with current versions of Sage is no longer under development. It has been superseded by the so-called Flask notebook, which has been rewritten during 2011 to use Flask as its webapp backend. Development is currently being migrated from Google Code to GitHub: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb

While it is not shipped with Sage, the Flask notebook can be installed into Sage with some effort (see instructions at http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/ ). This has been done on, for example, http://sagenb.org/ .

So it is probably more worthwhile for you to hack on the Flask notebook. Unfortunately the code you are patching is [marked as broken](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/sagenb/simple/twist.py#L8), so a lot more work would be required, it seems.

Sorry about this not being self-evident from the documentation / other sources...

Oh, I should also mention that the development discussion mailing list for sagenb is http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook .

Thanks for the update, kini.

If the simple server API ever gets ported to the Flask version, I hope this issue and #9785 are taken into account so that the same mistakes are not repeated. Otherwise, I have found the simple server API to be quite useful.

I think the simple server has been superseded by the [Sage cell server](https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell).

I don't know whether the sage cell server truly supersedes the simple server API. I've never used the latter but according to the docstring it is for interacting with a Sage _session_ oven HTTP. Isn't the sage cell server just running isolated computations in every cell?

Hmm.  In which case I'm not sure what to do with all these simple server tickets (#10027, #12232 here, #13154, #9785, #9275, possibly #6624).  The reality is (according to what I understand) this API hasn't worked for a long time well, and doesn't work at all with the current notebook.  So I feel like these tickets are unlikely to ever be worked on in their current state - note that #11409 would even remove these files completely.  I don't know... what do you think?

On a related note, I've used `linked:true` in the cell server to sort of emulate a session... but that's not the same, I agree.

Maybe someone will feel like resurrecting the simple server API at some point. Maybe make a new ticket for that, and have all these simple server tickets depend on it. (?)

Hmm.  But would that really be a Sage ticket at that point?  #11409 removes the `devel/sage/sage/server/simple` directory (among others).

I feel like it could be worth polling sage-devel/sage-notebook on how to deal with this.  I hate having clusters of tickets around that won't really get worked on in their current form.

wrt sage tickets vs sagenb tickets, I feel like sagenb might be reabsorbed into sage at some point. People split it off as a separate project so they could rapidly redo it in Flask, but development has really trailed off since that big push in 2011, and Sage is switching to git anyway so sagenb doesn't need to be a separate project to take advantage of DVCS nimbleness. Plus now there's cloud.sagemath.org and the ipython notebook so in the future sagenb might be fighting a war on two fronts (as a multi-user UI and a single-user UI respectively) to stay relevant as a project. Just my impression of the situation, which could of course be completely wrong. I'm not paying much attention to the Sage world recently...

Anyway, another option is just to say the simple server API has been removed and mark all these tickets as invalid.

Okay, I'm going to open a thread that hopefully people will actually comment on.  See [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/11oPFsETf9U).

Based on the lackluster conversation there, I'm closing these tickets.  However, they and their attachments should stay here in case such functionality does ever get reinstated - I wish that a couple other people had helped port it, but unfortunately not.

Also, note that at least some of the code still is in sagenb/simple/twist.py and likely will stay there, so the opportunity is still there to "port" it.
