I'm not sure if this is working as intended but in its current form the interrupt command interrupts the entire worksheet with no option to interrupt a particular cell. This can be a problem if you have a steady stream of computations on the queue and you only need to interrupt one of them. I suggest that the interrupt command accept an optional cell argument to indicate that a specific cell is to be interrupted; otherwise interrupt the worksheet to remain consistent with the current behavior.

The `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb` that is shipped with current versions of Sage is no longer under development. It has been superseded by the so-called Flask notebook, which has been rewritten during 2011 to use Flask as its webapp backend. Development is currently being migrated from Google Code to GitHub: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb

While it is not shipped with Sage, the Flask notebook can be installed into Sage with some effort (see instructions at http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/ ). This has been done on, for example, http://sagenb.org/ .

So it is probably more worthwhile for you to hack on the Flask notebook. Unfortunately the code you are patching is [marked as broken](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/sagenb/simple/twist.py#L8), so a lot more work would be required, it seems.

Sorry about this not being self-evident from the documentation / other sources...

Thanks for the update, kini.

If the simple server API ever gets ported to the Flask version, I hope this issue and #9785 are taken into account so that the same mistakes are not repeated. Otherwise, I have found the simple server API to be quite useful.

I feel like it could be worth polling sage-devel/sage-notebook on how to deal with this.  I hate having clusters of tickets around that won't really get worked on in their current form.
