The script `src/bin/math-readline` (from #16703) puts the terminal in a bad state (due to #20173).

I don't actually have Mathematica installed, so I'm just shooting in the dark here. Please test!

By the way, I cannot reproduce nor explain John's problem. So I'm not claiming to fix that, only the terminal issue.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2017-06-01 19:57:26

This seems to solve one of my problems, which is that the issue with `math-readline` was causing a doctest to time out, and since the doctest now uses `math` instead of `math-readline`, the doctest seems to work better. It's hard to know for sure since it was an intermittent problem, but with the current branch and a heavily loaded system, I had no timeouts in many attempts for `src/doctest/external.py`. When I reverted the change so as to run Mathematica using math-readline, I immediately got a timeout.

Summarizing: since I don't have mathematica installed, I really only care about the timeout in the doctest. The math-readline script may still be broken, but I don't care. Now people with mathematica need to test this.

Changing mathematica pexpect from `math-readline` to `math` breaks the pexpect interface -- it undoes the work that was done in #16703.

Neither [comment:8] nor #16703 explains how the Mathematica breaks, what goes wrong?

It's really hard to fix a problem when you don't even know what the problem is.

With `math`, `mathematica('1+2')` hangs indefinitely.
IIRC, the reason is that there are no prompts, and consequently pexpect hangs.

If so, how would the `math-readline` script fix that? That script is not writing prompts.

I feel like the patch at #16703 is a bad work-around for the Mathematica issue that #16703 fixes.

Anyway, there is not much that I can do with Mathematica being closed source...

Without investigating further, I think that Mathematica is trying to be helpful and does not write prompts in "non-interactive" situations.
I do not know the precise mechanism. The math-readline script seems to trick Mathematica into interactive mode.

I agree with both.

The strange thing is that `pexpect` is really supposed to be exactly like an interactive session. As far as the application is concerned, there should be no difference between a `pexpect` session or, say, an `xterm` or SSH session.

I have investigated further and have implemented two solutions, which can be selected by `use_pipe=False` or `True`. In either mode, the `math-readline` script is no longer used by the `Mathematica` pexpect interface (except for `mathematica_console`). See comments in `mathematica.py` for more info. 

Eliminating the use of a helper script also makes it more convenient to work with a remote Mathematica server and is also slightly faster. I have tested with Mathematica 11 on Mac OS X, both locally and with `server=localhost`. 

This could use some testing on different platforms and with different Mathematica versions.

testing on Linux with Mathematica 9.0, I get a timeout:

```
sage -tp --long --optional=database_gap,gap_packages,mpir,python2,mathematica,sage src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py 
...

sage: P = mathematica('Plot[Sin[x],{x,-2Pi,4Pi}]')   # optional - mathematica ## line 919 ##
sage: P._rich_repr_(dm)                              # optional - mathematica ## line 920 ##

sage -t --long --warn-long 73.2 src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py  # Timed out

```


this might have to do with the fact that I do it in `screen`, as apparently it gets stuck while trying to display stuff.

Comment by dimpase created at 2017-06-14 15:36:49

On the other hand, if I run tests as in comment:18 in a "normal" terminal, they work just fine. Thus I don't know whether or not this is a problem---I'm inclined to say that it's OK. Or perhaps one should tag this test like:

```
sage: P._rich_repr_(dm)    # optional - mathematica,goodconsole
```

and add a comment saying that this is to prevent a hang if running in `screen`.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2017-06-15 16:33:05

This is very strange. I can't reproduce this in "screen" here on Mac OS X. What happens if you run these commands interactively in a screen session on your Linux box?
Here I see:

```
sage: P._rich_repr_(dm)
OutputImagePng container
```

In a screen session, this just hangs. (`P.show()` hands too)

In terminal, it works---there is a "flashing" movement going through the display, as if it quickly pops something out and closes it.
And `P.show()` displays the graph. Don't know, it might be something to do with X11 in general, or X11 specifics on this particular host.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2017-06-16 17:05:58

Is the `DISPLAY` variable set in your screen session?
Could you check if this problem goes away if you unset `DISPLAY` first?
In my opinion, the doctests should never do anything using X11.

same behaviour.

I don't really know why this happens, but it has to do with Mathematica
interaction, apparently. If I instead do

```
P=plot(sin(x))
P._rich_repr_(dm)
```

then it does work, outputting `OutputImagePng container`, as expected.

These seem relevant:
 - https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/5026/generating-figures-over-remote-connection-using-terminal
 - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/qILC4ZCEvKk

Essentially, these doctests should be marked "on Linux, need DISPLAY"...

OK, I've invented an `optional` tag for this. Can't test whether more doctests in this file need this markup as I don't have a Mathematica license on Linux.

Here is a solution.

But there may be a much simpler solution for this whole problem addressed in #16703, #20173 that may have been overlooked - namely to use `math -rawterm` (http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/UsingATextBasedInterface.html.en).
(Not tried yet.)

Now here's the solution using `math -rawterm`. Much simpler and seems to work well. Needs review.

I am trying this out with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Mathematica 11.1.0, and I am running into some problems with `mathematica_console()`. The first is that I am not seeing my input in the console:

```
sage: mathematica_console()
Mathematica 11.1.0 Kernel for Linux x86 (64-bit)
Copyright 1988-2017 Wolfram Research, Inc.

In[1]:= 
Out[1]= 4
```

The second is once I quit Sage, it no longer restores the echo of my terminal (i.e., I have to manually type in `stty echo` before it is back to normal). Similarly if I immediately go into, e.g., `gap_console()`. Although within Sage I still get the echo, but I am guessing that has more to do with iPython than with stty. I also removed the additional argument to `command`, but that had no effect. Instead, what solved it was passing `readline=False` to `mathematica_console`, but I don't understand enough to figure out what is going on. At the very least, this should not be the default behavior.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2017-11-01 05:18:55

The input issue seems to have been caused by #20173. This is what is meant in the description here by "puts the terminal in a bad state".


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-11-01 05:37:55

I see. I thought this ticket was suppose to fix that? Or was #20173 supposed to be reverted as part of this ticket?

Edit - No, it has been removed; I just didn't look at my diff correctly.

I'm not Dima, but I wish I was. :D I'm assuming you were talking to me.

I didn't think I would need to re-run `make` since it was a modification to a script in `bin`. After doing a `make` and trying again it worked.

I agree that it works fairly well. There are some issues with hitting `<tab>` (as I am too well-trained in tab-completion to not do it) and then backspacing, but that can be a follow-up ticket if it even is on our end.

Apologies, I misread who was the commenter in comment 37.
Travis, thanks for reviewing!

In a follow-up ticket, one could change the default of `mathematica_console` to `readline=False`, because all modern mathematica versions support line editing already. I didn't want to do this change in the same ticket.
