# Issue 24953: Some documentation improvements for LLL

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25190

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2018-04-17 13:47:04

Keywords: LLL

The documentation of `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.LLL` mentions an incorrect default value for the `delta` parameter.  This ticket fixes this and makes some other improvements to the documentation of this method and the similar `BKZ` method.
