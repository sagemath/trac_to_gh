`cygwin-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/983346777?check_suite_focus=true) `maplotlib` build fails:

```
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-ixb64a6o/setupext.py", line 461, in add_numpy_flags
        import numpy as np
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py", line 143, in <module>
        from . import lib
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/__init__.py", line 25, in <module>
        from .index_tricks import *
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/index_tricks.py", line 11, in <module>
        import numpy.matrixlib as matrixlib
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/matrixlib/__init__.py", line 4, in <module>
        from .defmatrix import *
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/matrixlib/defmatrix.py", line 11, in <module>
        from numpy.linalg import matrix_power
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/linalg/__init__.py", line 73, in <module>
        from .linalg import *
      File "/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/linalg/linalg.py", line 33, in <module>
        from numpy.linalg import lapack_lite, _umath_linalg
    ImportError: No such file or directory
```

also `scipy` fails with the same error.

`r` system package is not used because prereq `curl` is not accepted:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG curl...
checking for curl 7.22... /usr/bin/curl
checking for gawk... (cached) gawk
checking for curl-config... /usr/bin/curl-config
checking for the version of libcurl... 7.71.1
checking for libcurl >= version 7.22... yes
checking whether libcurl is usable... no
checking whether programs linking to libcurl can be executed... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG curl
```


and then building `r` also fails:

```

Hi Erik, do you have time to look into this ticket?

This looks like a good start so far and your analysis of how to detect openblas makes sense.  I'll look into it when I get back to my Windows machine.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

It looks like one of the first things that needs to be fixed is properly detecting the system curl on Cygwin.  I remember having trouble with this before.  I thought I looked into it at one point, and I think even fixed it somehow, but now I don't remember for sure, or why the fix hasn't made it into Sage if indeed I did fix it...

No, libcurl is detected correctly, see https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2070658581

Ok, great.  I just mentioned it since one of your earlier comments on this thread said as much.  But that was also several months ago.  I could have sworn it was working now.
