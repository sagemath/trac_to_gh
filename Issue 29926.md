`cygwin-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/983346777?check_suite_focus=true) `maplotlib` build fails:

```

        from numpy.linalg import lapack_lite, _umath_linalg
    ImportError: No such file or directory
```

also `scipy` fails with the same error.

`r` system package is not used because prereq `curl` is not accepted:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG curl...
checking for curl 7.22... /usr/bin/curl
checking for gawk... (cached) gawk
checking for curl-config... /usr/bin/curl-config

checking whether libcurl is usable... no
checking whether programs linking to libcurl can be executed... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG curl
```


and then building `r` also fails:

```

This looks like a good start so far and your analysis of how to detect openblas makes sense.  I'll look into it when I get back to my Windows machine.
