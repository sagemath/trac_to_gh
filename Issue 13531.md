Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  @fchapoton

Keywords: coefficient repr

Currently, we have

```
sage: alpha,beta,gamma=FreeAlgebra(ZZ,3,'alpha,beta,gamma').gens()
sage: latex(alpha-beta)
\alpha + \left(-1\right)\beta
```


This patch turns this into

```
sage: alpha,beta,gamma=FreeAlgebra(ZZ,3,'alpha,beta,gamma').gens()
sage: latex(alpha-beta)
\alpha - \beta
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13735

This is very right. And I think you're right that the patch should not only handle one particular case (which I was catching in a completely different context).

I will look into that...

Hi!

Scratching my own itch, I've changed the code for repr_lincomb to properly handle negative coefficients as well as zero. It required one change to how coeff_repr works which may cause problems. I've included testcases for repr_lincomb. 

Is there a way how can I test the rest of sage only for this specific change? I don't want to run all the numerical test which take quite a while on my machine.

To see if your patch causes problems somewhere, you cannot do much that running the complete doctests...

sage:  A2 = WeylCharacterRing(['A',2], base_ring = R, style="coroots")
