# Issue 20229: Can't multiply continued fractions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20466

There has been some reimplementation on here, so maybe this is no longer true, but [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33131/coercion-on-continued-fractions/) anyway points out

```
sage: x = continued_fraction(pi)
sage: y = 3*x
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'sage.rings.continued_fraction.ContinuedFraction_real'>'
```

Changing keywords from "" to "continued_fraction".

maybe we can close as duplicate ?

Why would you? #19120 does not implement the full gosper algorithm for `(a xy + b x + cy + d) / (e xy + f x + g y + h)` but only `(ax + b) / (cx + d)`.

Though that could work for `3*x`.

indeed. Y a un algo pour multiplier deux fractions continues quelconques ?
