Implement a function to compute the periodic points of a given period of a projective/affine morphism. Should have the option to return only the minimal points of a given period.

- title: no affine

- spaces around =

- Fields, PolynomialRing imports at top of file
 - Fields should be Fields() in if (same for projective_homset)

- clean-up dsecription of periodic_points

- use set_verbose(None) instead of -1

- QQbar import at top of file

- both True and False example for periodic points

- Here is an interesting example:


```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f=H([x^2 - 21/16*z^2,y^2-2*z^2,z^2])
f.periodic_points(1)
```



- This example fails:


```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QuadraticField(5,'t'),2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f=H([x^2 - 21/16*z^2,y^2-z^2,z^2])
f.periodic_points(2, True)
```


Some of the points returned are fixed points. It is probably from how .remove() is functioning

- A couple more examples, using number fields would be good too.

A couple issues here. The new examples are good, but you need to fix the spacing. Also, while the new version of the .remove() should give expected results, it would be better to use a loop that simply worked backwards and removed them as you went.

range(len(points),-1,-1)

Just a couple things here.  The new removal does now get the correct points returned, so that's good.

However, there is now a doctest failure in algebraic_scheme.py. I assume this is because it is calling the dimension 0 version instead of enumeration and so is getting the points in a different order.


```
File "src/sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py", line 1461, in sage.schemes.generic.algebraic_scheme.AlgebraicScheme_subscheme.rational_points
Failed example:
    X.rational_points(3)
Expected:
    [(-1 : 1), (1 : 1)]
Got:
    [(1 : 1), (-1 : 1)]
```



Also, I missed this last time, but the call


```
X.defining_ideal().dimension()
```


is a groebner basis calculation. There two places where you call it just a couple lines apart. You should only call it once and store the value.

The enumerate functions sort their lists of points before returning, so I added sorting for the dimension zero cases. I updated the output in the examples for periodic_points to match the new sorted lists.

The functionality is fine, but what is this


```
from pickle import INST
```


on the first line of projective_homset.py?

I'm not sure. I think it has something to do with testing pickles, but I don't know much about that. It's defined in misc/explain_pickle.py, and the only place in the sage directory that the import is present is projective_homset. Everything appears to run fine without it; do you think it would be okay to remove it? It might just be remnants from testing that was done before.

I was asking since it looks like you added it in the e1299ee commit. It doesn't seem to be used in the file. If you did not add it for a particular purpose, then I would remove it.

Oops, I didn't notice that it was added in an earlier commit. I don't think it was intentional.

oops, I thought I'd checked the docs, but apparently not. They build now with the latest fix.
