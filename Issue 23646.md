While fixing some other metaclass issues, I stumbled on this:

```
In [2]: from sage.misc.inherit_comparison import InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass

In [20]: InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass.__new__(InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-20-32ba2e866e5e> in <module>()
----> 1 InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass.__new__(InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass)

TypeError: sage.misc.inherit_comparison.InheritComparisonMetaclass.__new__(InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass) is not safe, use sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__new__()
```
