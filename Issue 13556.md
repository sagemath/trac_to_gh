Assignee: @aghitza

Keywords: interval, polynomial, multivariate

Some multiplications in multivariate polynomial rings over RIF or CIF are wrong:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(RIF,2)
sage: RIF(-2,1)*x
0
```



## More tests


```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(RIF,2)
sage: RIF(-2,1)          # OK
0.?e1
sage: RIF(-2,1)*x        # Wrong
0
sage: RIF(-2,1)*x == 0   # Wrong
True
sage: cmp(RIF(-2,1)*x,0) # Wrong
0
sage: RIF(2,5)*x         # OK
1.?e1*x
sage: RIF(2,5)*x == 0    # OK
False
```


## Code digging

The problem comes from the coercion:

```
sage: R(RIF(-2,1))
0
sage: R(RIF(-2,1)) == 0
True
```


This in turn comes from the creation (in `__init__` of class `MPolynomial_polydict` in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element`) of a PolyDict object (defined in `sage.rings.polynomial.polydict`) with the option `remove_zero == True`.


```
from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict import PolyDict
sage: PolyDict({(0,0):1}, remove_zero=True) # OK
PolyDict with representation {(0, 0): 1}
sage: PolyDict({(0,0):0}, remove_zero=True) # OK
PolyDict with representation {}
sage: PolyDict({(0,0):RIF(-1,1)}, remove_zero=True) # Wrong
PolyDict with representation {}
```


To check if x is 0, PolyDict uses the test `x != 0`, which actually checks for disjointness in interval field:


```
sage: RIF(-2,1) != 0
False
```



## Possible correction

This bug might be corrected by replacing in PolyDict the tests `x != zero` by one of:
- `cmp(x,0) != zero`
- `not x.is_zero()`
- `not x == zero`
