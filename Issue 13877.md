# Issue 13877: Solve bug in BraidGroup

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mmarco

Original creation time: 2013-02-07 18:56:56

BraidGroup checks that the number of generators is bigger or equal than 2. It should be 1 (two strands, one generator). So, now the braid group on two strands can't be created.

This patch solves it. (It is just a one line change):

Could you add a doctest showing this is fixed and a comment on that about about why it should be `n < 1` instead of `n < 2` as the error message (correctly) indicates (such as `# n now is the number of generators`)? Once that is done, set this to needs_review.

Thanks,

Travis

There's also a doctest failure (due to capitalization). Also, for the doctest, could you make it some form of:

```
Check that :trac:`14081` is fixed::

    sage: BraidGroup(2)
    Braid group on 2 strands
    sage: BraidGroup(('a',))
    Braid group on 2 strands
```

Thanks.
