Follow-up on #20462:

- Why does a `MIPVariable` only have `set_max`, but no `get_max`? 

- Why does `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.set_max` delegate to a `MIPVariable` method of the same name, when  other `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` methods such as `set_integer` etc. just do everything directly, and no corresponding `MIPVariable` methods exist?

- Actually these things should properly be referred to as `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` rather than `min` and `max`. Some deprecation fun to be had.

- Why is there no way to query the values of the components of the `_default_mipvariable`?
