# Issue 12577: Raise algebras/free_algebra.py coverage to 100%

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: JStarx

Original creation time: 2012-03-26 06:44:23

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: FreeAlgebra, doctest

The attached patch adds a doctest to `_coerce_map_from_`, which was the only function missing one.

In the list of things coercing into a free algebra, you have

```
        398	        - Polynomial rings in the same variables over a base with a coercion 
 	399	          map into self.base_ring() 
```

This is false: a polynomial ring (in which the variables commute) does not, and should not, coerce into a free algebra (in which they don't). Did you mean "*free algebras* in the same variables..."?

```
sage: F = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, 3, 'x,y,z')
sage: G = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 3, 'x,y,z')
sage: F.has_coerce_map_from(G)
False
```

I just copied what was in the comments into the docstring, but you're right it's incorrect.  I've fixed the docstring and the comments now.
