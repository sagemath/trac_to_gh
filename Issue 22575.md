CC:  @kiwifb @embray

sometimes LDFLAGS must come first, but in gfan's makefile LDFLAGS are put last. This makes it impossible to build on FreeBSD without extra hack, such as redefining CXX to include LDFLAGS.

We clean this mess up by making use of special variables (CDD-related) in its makefile, and remove LDFLAGS hack from spkg-install.

Does this work OK on OSX and Cygwin?

I don't see why not. Your new patch is more invasive than the previous one for no visible reason (to me)

```
-ifeq ($(cddpath),)
-CDD_LINKOPTIONS = -L/usr/local -lcddgmp
+CDD_LINKOPTIONS = -L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib -lcddgmp -lgmp -lm
 CDD_INCLUDEOPTIONS =
-else
-CDD_LINKOPTIONS = $(cddpath)/lib/libcddgmp.a
-CDD_INCLUDEOPTIONS = -I $(cddpath)/include
-endif
```

Why do you need the above? The malformed is not a big problem. I guess a bigger problem is if the variable `LIBRARY_PATH` is not used with clang on freeBSD. But then I would expect you to have trouble in other places.

Well, if you mean to say that I should leave the `else` part, which is never triggered under Sage, intact, I certainly can do this. (Although I see no harm in removing things which are not used).

Apart from the `if/else` thing (as I said, I can leave it in), this is done to clean up the flags a bit; presently that
`-L/usr/local -lcddgmp` is worked around in `spkg-install`, basically by appending the correct `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib -lcddgmp -lgmp -lm` to `LDFLAGS` (the latter are appended in the makefile). I cannot keep doing this, I really need `LDFLAGS` in front, for this to work.

Besides, needless to say, if you really happen to have `libcddgmp` in `/usr/local/`, all the bets are off, you might end up with a linker error, or worse.

I could have plugged `LDFLAGS` into the 1st position into the right line of of the makefile, and leave the rest as it is, but this is ugly IMHO.

OK, but the only thing you really need to do is remove `-L/usr/local` the rest is under control. Adding `-lgmp` is not useful as it is already provided by `GMP_LINKOPTIONS`.

I merely move adding `-lm`, needed on other systems, not only FreeBSD, from `spkg-install` to the makefile directly. 

```
-# set LDFLAGS with proper flags to link against gmp/mpir and cddlib
-LDFLAGS="-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib -lcddgmp -lgmp -lm $LDFLAGS"
```

There are several way to skin a cat as they say, I go for either minimal or complete revamp - which would feel nice here. Quite a number of things have moved since the original `spkg-install` making it easier to be minimalistic.

I'll do a branch...
