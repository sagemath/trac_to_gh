Implement a full-featured texture map for 3d plots.  This should support colormaps, but also mapping opacity, ambient, specular, shininess, etc.

Colormaps were first implemented in #12212, but this implementation does not easily extend to more general texture maps.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18525

Made some progress on this, but have to put it down for a little while now.  There are probably errors in the current code.
