Amen to that.

Technically, this ticket does not break doctests. It just reports doctests which were already broken. And of course you can run `sage -t --optional=sage` as before (all doctests will pass), the same way that you can run `sage -t --optional=<your_packages>` in the latest beta to see all broken doctests.

I cannot fix all broken doctests of all optional packages in Sage, and I doubt that anybody can. If you set this ticket to `needs_work` until this is done you will just kill the ticket, and achieve nothing. If this ticket is merged, we will at last see the bugs that we missed until now, and fix them progressively. We cannot keep hiding bugs, and pretend that they do not exist just because we never run the optional doctests.

That might be in the scope of this ticket.

On the other hand: Detecting failing tests (so that they can be marked) would require running `make ptest` on a Sage installation with all optional packages. Or perhaps even one Sage installation for each subset of optional packages, since I could imagine that optional package A makes tests fail that work fine if additionally optional package B is installed.

I believe very strongly that no ticket should be merged if it is known to make `make ptestlong` fail on systems where it used to pass. I am willing to shoot the messenger if needed, that's why `# known  bug` exists.

That's what I'm worried about.\n\n\nMy hope is that it will only last momentarily. That whoever sees broken doctests will fix them, and that eventually we will fix those bugs instead of hiding them.\n\nThe only guys who run doctests (well, except bots) are developers. They are assumed to know that a beta release is \"experimental\" to some extent (big red warning on our website, and when you run sage).\n\nThen there is the advertisement: we should probably wait for a beta0 release to merge this ticket (it can be reviewed before `:-P`), and when we do add a message (on sage-release, and why not in sage-banner) explaining a bit what happens.

My hope is that it will only last momentarily. That whoever sees broken doctests will fix them, and that eventually we will fix those bugs instead of hiding them.

The only guys who run doctests (well, except bots) are developers. They are assumed to know that a beta release is "experimental" to some extent (big red warning on our website, and when you run sage).

Then there is the advertisement: we should probably wait for a beta0 release to merge this ticket (it can be reviewed before `:-P`), and when we do add a message (on sage-release, and why not in sage-banner) explaining a bit what happens. A "fix-optional-doctests" release, so that less persons have to wonder why doctests break all of a sudden. And help us fix them.

Even worse. Now you just killed all experimental packages. I think there should be a place in Sage for things that are known to be broken but that people still care about.

Actually, a good compromise for this ticket might be: test only *optional* packages, move the known-broken packages (like `4ti2`) to experimental.

If you want, you can create tickets for each of these broken packages and advertise them on sage-devel. If people care, they can fix the package and move it back to optional. If people don't care, there is nothing lost either.

Experimental packages are *advertised* as broken [1]. Why would you expect them to pass tests? Addtionally, doctests can be removed if we need to. We can do that during the release cycle that will merge this branch.

+1, this is the difference between optional and experimental packages, and we keep the best of both points of views. I will add : "propose a way to test all installed (experimental) packages as well".

You claimed yourself that "The only guys who run doctests (well, except bots) are developers", hence if we want to advertize those bugs to users, this is not the appropriate way, we should write stopgaps instead.

Another precision: one advantage of 'installed' over 'installed_optional' and 'installed_experimental' is that it is currently impossible to get (without internet access) the list of all optional/experimental packages.

What can be listed 'locally':
- All installed packages
- All new-style packages filtered by type (standard/optional)

Thus, I can only write a branch which test all new-style optional packages (there are no experimental new-style packages). If an old-style spkg is installed, I have no way to 'detect' its category.

It can be either 'installed' or 'new-style optional'.

Valgrind can have relatively system-dependent output, or so I've been led to believe.

That's true, but you can still give your opinion after seeing the commit. I am currently testing this ticket. It's easier for me to fix bugs right away instead of first explaining the problem on the ticket and then waiting for you to fix it before I can continue testing.

> and as a result I am forced to agree with whatever you do here if I want my code to pass.

You're not forced to agree with anything. I you don't agree, you tell me or you change it. No problem.

> you consider anything related to this ticket as a dependency of it
* About #18124 and #18563: those are needed because otherwise all doctests would not pass.
* About #18559: I added that as a dependency only after it got positive_review (and you're the author so I assume you agree with that ticket), so it won't slow down this ticket.

> This, without reviewing this ticket's main dependency: #18456.

It seems that there are already other reviewers on that ticket. In any case, it's not because I help you with this ticket, that I should be forced to review its dependencies.

Right, except would the user actually know that the solution to the failure was upgrading?  In principle we don't want a sage-release or other email to come in unless there is an actual failure.  If this gives a clear message to that effect (upgrade package so-and-so) then it's no problem.

I disagree, because this means that the (old) default behavior of not getting doctest failures will be replaced (possibly) by lots of perhaps-very-confusing doctest errors, with this branch.

But I don't have any specific ideas on how to solve the problem, just wondering how it is/will be dealt with.

Disagree already.  There are lots of places it warns people to run doctests to check that Sage works, and likewise there are a number of optional packages that people "just need".

The only reason I think it belongs on this ticket is because this ticket would expose the problem.  I would say it would do so rather dramatically except I don't have any evidence for it.  But again, here is what I anticipate:

1. User occasionally runs doctests because is told it's a good idea to make sure their Sage works.
2. User updates Sage but not some package they use, because that wasn't announced somewhere they saw it (git logs are not announcements)
3. User runs doctests and gets mysterious failures that seem to be related to updating Sage, but are actually related to not updating package.
4. User sends email to sage-devel or sage-release or sage-support or ask.sagemath or whatever.
5. Someone whose time is better spent on real bugs has to figure out what the heck happened.

Without this ticket, that is much less likely to happen, since the person would have to be running optional doctests - and I would agree that such a person is not so likely to be a beginner.  But that's not what would happen here.

Anyway, if two people (e.g. you and Jeroen) feel like it's not worth dealing with here (and it probably would be a big change) I won't complain further, except to say "I told you so" if it happens and to be very happy if it turns out it doesn't.  I did want to make sure it got raised, though.

Detecting whether "the local version of a package" is the latest available can be done easily from the output of `sage-list-package` (see #18456).

If what you want is to automatically detect, in doctests or when running Sage, that some errors are caused by an old version of a package, then it is a more complicated problem and you could help make this conversation more constructive by describing a specific behaviour that you would like. It is my belief that it is also, in this case, unrelated to this ticket.

We can know the version of any installed packaged, be it new or old. See output of `sage -installed` in #18456. Detecting this is not a problem.

> The only reason I think it belongs on this ticket is because this ticket would expose the problem.


This ticket cannot fix all the pre-existing bugs that it exposes. If everybody comes and say "this bug existed before, you must fix it or your code will not pass" I will give up very quickly.

> 1. User occasionally runs doctests because is told it's a good idea to make sure their Sage works.


Jeroen made sure that all tests will pass. So that's not a problem.

> 1. User updates Sage but not some package they use, because that wasn't announced somewhere they saw it (git logs are not announcements)


For new-style packages this is already done automatically.

> 1. User runs doctests and gets mysterious failures that seem to be related to updating Sage, but are actually related to not updating package.


Again, only happens for old-style packages. Convert them to new-style to avoid this problem.

That is not what I was asking about, however.

On a related note (certainly not to be dealt with here) would there be something that would auto test optional *interfaces*, which are also marked with `# optional`?  Like Maple or Mma. That would be very useful for keeping those interfaces up-to-date.

Auto-upgrading optional packages is, I assure you, totally unrelated from adding some keyword to "--optional" automatically when running doctests.

Hmm.  I think not all of these are exactly optional.

Also, the individual commands it runs look like

This seems to work very nicely in that way.  I think this is certainly doing what I was hoping for.

On the other hand, it allows tests only on `python2` or `python3`, that might be actually useful. And `scons` was made optional just because the Python 3 porting people asked for that. I would just live with this, it's not really a problem anyway. It's only shown in the beginning of the doctest log.

The "Failed example" shows `# optional - gambit`. Is that not clear enough?

An interesting thing that comes up with #18637's fixes is that I don't think the `internet` optional doctests were tested in my run.  It that something that your changes (or something) could also automatically assess?  Those tests constantly are breaking, and it would be wonderful if that could be done here.

However, I recognize that may be orthogonal enough (or difficult enough) to not bother with here, and instead better to deal with elsewhere.

Actually, for reasons I really don't understand, my previous code with `urllib2` gave me a ton of segfaults when doctesting Sage (?!). In fact I was getting segfaults just from inserting the lines

```
import urllib2
urllib2.urlopen('http://sagemath.org/')
```
without the line `options.optional.add('internet')`. I must be doing something wrong, but I don't know what.

Optional packages that are outside of sage (like graphviz and mathematica) are currently not detected as tags. With mathematica 10.0 and sage 6.8.beta3 and graphviz and this ticket I get:

```
$ sage -t src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

but

```
sage -t --optional=mathematica src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py  # 50 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Similarly, less tests are done because the tag graphviz is not detected:

```
$ sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph_latex.py

sage -t src/sage/graphs/graph_latex.py

compared to

```
