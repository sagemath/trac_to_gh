Added missing imports in src/sage/modular/overconvergent/genus0.py and src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/constructor.py. Hopefully this passes patchbot now; the rest of the changes looked good to me.

Thanks for fixing this!

The remaining failure, from `src/sage/rings/integer.pyx`, is not from this ticket. It is fixed in #32737.

`pyflakes` detects that the import `from sage.rings.ring import EuclideanDomain, Field` in `generic_nodes.py` can probably be removed now.

Merged #32665 to resolve merge conflict.

If we are touching this line anyway, we might as well add the second space before `#`:

```diff
+        elif isinstance(base, sage.rings.abc.pAdicField): # change base to Qpbar
```


Once done, you can put it on positive review on my behalf.
