I suppose the documentation should mention dependence on yasm.
(The version on the yasm's website appears to be 1.3, same as on a couple of Linux
machines I checked, so that's matter of doing `apt-get install yasm` or something like this. Although on `arando` buildbot it's 1.2, not 1.3, and so something would have to be done to such older systems).

Dima, do we need yasm 1.3 to compile MPIR 3.0.0? Building MPIR on arando would fail?

Bull writes in no uncertain terms that you need the latest version of yasm.
As 1.2 is almost 6 years old, I imagine that on new CPUs there could be problems, as the  code for the CPU won't compile.

arando has old CPU, more that 6 years old in fact, and I just checked that there MPIR compiles and passes all its checks (with system's gcc 6.2 and yasm 1.2).

That was the only sane thing to do... so Sage needs to ship it separately or we make it a build dependency.

I would say as is indeed too old.
The problematic file is:
* https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/blob/master/mpn/x86_64/skylake/avx/addmul_1.asm
using adcx/adox instructions.
These were added in a post july 2012 as release:
* https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=e2e1fcde622f2f6cedfd7fb6615aa6e136f21dec
And debian wheezy ships binutils 2.22 which is pre-2012:
* https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/

So can we ignore this very outdated OS?
It's a Debian old stable, so quite very old...

Hum, I did not actually test on a debian 7 seven, I just looked at what GNU as version is provided there and thought I ound the issue.
So several possibilities:
* I'm stupid,
* the check for as version I implemented is wrong,
* the issue is somewhere else.

The easiest way to solve this would be to get access to the machine...
I downloaded a bunch of qemu debian 7 images but the pc I mostly work on does not have internet access and these images come wihtout gnu as :/

You are probably right. It is not a correct way to ascertain that `CC` is `gcc`, you'd have to look at `$CC -v` or similar. Considering the only other possibility is `clang`  during toolchain building on OS X and that

```
Mirage:~ fbissey$ as --version | head -1 | awk 'NF>1{print $NF}'
(clang-802.0.42)
```

won't be caught by your `case` statement, I think we can just scrap the `$CC=GCC` bit.

Yes it is.
One of the former developer prefered ATT syntax over intel (or the other way around) and that was not very well supported by gas at that time, don't know the current situation.
Moreover yasm provides better windows support with stack dark magic unwinding feature.

Files are treated by yasm or gas depending on their extension (as or asm).
