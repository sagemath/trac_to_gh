# Issue 11668: sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.collect_common_factors has no documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2011-09-23 19:25:10

Assignee: mvngu

The collect_common_factors method has an example, but no other documentation. It is not obvious from the documentation what the method is supposed to do.

Changing keywords from "" to "symbolic, beginner".

Here is a git branch with a little bit more documentation for this method.

I have also taken the opportunity to put raise statement into python3 format, and to use the trac role to add links to the tickets.

I'd put the comment about `LOG_TEN_TWO_PLUS_EPSILON` before its definition rather than below. The rest looks fine to me.

Conflict, please merge in latest beta

Sorry, but I do not see any conflit with 6.2.beta3. Is there any 6.2.beta4 ?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-05 14:20:36

No, not yet. Conflict is then probably due to the pynac update #15198. The easiest solution will be to try again when beta4 is out.

In case it may be of use, I rebased Frédéric's branch on top of https://github.com/vbraun/sage.git/develop and uploaded the result under `u/mmezzarobba/11840-collect_common_factors`.

Wait, this change will also conflict with #15892, which probably should go in first.

Please merge in 6.2.beta4

Merges fine with 6.2beta5. Docs compile and look good. I have uploaded a reviewer's patch at `public/11840`. If you like it, set positive. If not, set `Branch:` to your branch again and set positive.
