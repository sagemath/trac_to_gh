Using the flattening morphism from #21106 we can divide more polynomials!

Looks fine to me. All test pan out.

Note that fixing the quo_rem resolves the issue in #21100. So I've included a commit with that example to test that issue. We can then close that ticket as resolved or whatever is appropriate.

If you're fine with the example, this can be marked positive-review.
