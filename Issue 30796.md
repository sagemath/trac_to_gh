Magma implements a command called `IsEasySnAn` to cheaply detect whether an irreducible polynomial of degree `n` over the rational has Galois group containing the alternating group on `n` letters. I believe this is based on a method of Davenport-Smith ("Fast recognition of alternating and symmetric Galois groups"). I propose to implement the same in Sage.

I should perhaps emphasize that the point here is to make the command blindingly fast. One important aspect of this is using distinct-degree factorization, rather than full factorization, of the reduction of the polynomial modulo a prime. This is not currently available in Sage, but FLINT does provide it and so it would be easy enough to expose.

IMO, the name of the method is difficult to understand unless you look at the doc. I would propose renaming it `is_easy_sn_an` -> `galois_group_sn_an_fast` or something similar. Otherwise LGTM.
