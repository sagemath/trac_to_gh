# Issue 30796: Fast check for alternating/symmetric Galois groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31033

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2020-12-09 21:26:27

Keywords: Galois group

Magma implements a command called `IsEasySnAn` to cheaply detect whether an irreducible polynomial of degree `n` over the rational has Galois group containing the alternating group on `n` letters. I believe this is based on a method of Davenport-Smith ("Fast recognition of alternating and symmetric Galois groups"). I propose to implement the same in Sage.

I should perhaps emphasize that the point here is to make the command blindingly fast. One important aspect of this is using distinct-degree factorization, rather than full factorization, of the reduction of the polynomial modulo a prime. This is not currently available in Sage, but FLINT does provide it and so it would be easy enough to expose.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Modulo the use of distinct-degree factorization (which should probably be its own ticket), here is an implementation of the Davenport-Smith method.

Not yet using distinct-degree factorization, but maybe that should be a subsequent ticket.

IMO, the name of the method is difficult to understand unless you look at the doc. I would propose renaming it `is_easy_sn_an` -> `galois_group_sn_an_fast` or something similar. Otherwise LGTM.

Another possibility is being very explicit `galois_group_davenport_smith_test`.

I went with the explicit option.
