I see that the resulting graphs are created via 


```
         G = BipartiteGraph(s[:-1], format='graph6')

You are right. Not easy when `n1` and `n2` are somewhere in the `options` string...

I'm not particularly proud of my solution of parsing the auxiliary output, but it's working for as long as the user don't pass option -q (which suppress the auxiliary output).

More of a nitpick: I think `(-s, -a)` and, e.g., `">M"` should be code-formatted.

I agree that it is not that elegant, but it seems to work. If issues arise down the road, we can fix them then.

Whether or not you include my above nitpick, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I'm not sure to understand what you asked for... I changed to `(``-s``, ``-a``)`.

I prefer to avoid mentioning `">M"`. It can effectively be used to count graphs, but it's not documented and does not even appear in the source code of `genbg`.

Yes, thatâ€™s right: code formatting is ````.

Those kind of things were included in the doc though. Anyways, not so important.

```
$ nauty-genbg 5 28
>E genbg: must have n1=1..24, n1+n2=1..32

Should these restrictions be checked by the interface and an appropriate error be raised?
