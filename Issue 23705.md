# Issue 23705: Fix category for subcrystals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23942

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-09-29 19:30:23

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling bsalisbury1

Keywords: crystals

This should not raise an error:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['A',2])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=3, category=HighestWeightCrystals())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: 'HighestWeightCrystals_with_category' object is not iterable
```

The category is not passed to the parent `subcrystal` call:

```
sage: x = B.module_generator()
sage: S = x.subcrystal(max_depth=3, category=HighestWeightCrystals())
sage: S.category()
Category of finite crystals
```
