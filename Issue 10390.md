Keywords: ideal discrete logarithm

It's often useful to be able to solve the discrete logarithm problem for the multiplicative group of a number field modulo an (integral) ideal. Pari's function "ideallog" does this, but it uses a choice of generators which are chosen in an arbitrary and non-deterministic way.

The aim of this patch is to make it possible to compute discrete logs with respect to a user-specified set of generators. This is a prerequisite for my work with Jared Weinstein on local components of modular forms.

My only comment is that it might be worth caching the hermite forms computed here, if you're computing with respect to the same generators often.
