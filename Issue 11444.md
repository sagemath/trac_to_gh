Setting this to "needs review" since the MPIR 2.1.3.p4 from #8664 got positive review again, though so far only by a single reviewer.

The current packages are mainly meant for **testing the new upstream releases**, hopefully on a variety of platforms supported by Sage; some improvements or changes to Sage's part will most probably follow.

It would just be nice to *relatively early* know whether any of them (more important, MPIR 2.4.0) causes any problems on one of our platforms. (MPIR 2.5.0 is scheduled for September 1st, which isn't that far...)

The following can be removed now:

```
# The Yasm build uses PYTHON from the environment to find python, so unset
# it since the setting from 'spkg/standard/newest_version' confuses it:
unset PYTHON
# This can be removed once #10492 has been merged, which turns the "package
# version" environment variables into solely `make` variables, such that the
# (shell) environment does no longer get polluted.
```

Also: do you feel like adding a work-around for #12765:

```
# Work around a bug in GCC 4.7.0 on ia64:
# http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48496
if [ "`uname -m`" = ia64 ] && [ "`testcc.sh $CC`" = GCC ] ; then
    if $CC -dumpversion | grep >/dev/null '^4\.7\.0$' ; then
        echo >&2 "Warning: Working around bug in gcc 4.7.0"
        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O0"
    fi
fi
```

After sage-5.0.beta12 is released, I plan to test this spkg on the buildbots.

Attachment [mpir-2.1.3.p9-2.4.0.p1.diff](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11616/mpir-2.1.3.p9-2.4.0.p1.diff) by @nexttime created at 2012-04-05 15:39:32

I've uploaded a second, p2 spkg with further fixes, also incorporating [the] changes from / for

* #11844 (potential race condition in `yasm` build),
* #12765 (build error on Linux ia64 (Itanium) with GCC 4.7.0, which is a GCC bug),
* #12782 (build MPIR without C++ interface [and without static libraries] when bootstrapping the GCC spkg),
* `configure` error with the GCC spkg on MacOS X (on a Core i7 with AVX), as [reported on sage-release](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/e2a87c73dc1625f2/59f691883df94e7f#59f691883df94e7f).

See the changelog entries in the description and the attached diffs for details and further changes.




The p2 is still somewhat preliminary (subject to further testing), although *I don't expect*<sup>TM</sup> further changes to be necessary, despite that haven't committed the changes yet.

Why don't you simply remove lines 179--189 regarding PYTHON?  I don't think it serves any purpose anymore.  Also, it shouldn't be needed for upgrades since `PYTHON` is only set by the old `spkg/install` and `spkg/install` is always immediately upgraded.

It does, because occasionally people (try to) install newer MPIR spkgs into older (e.g. 4.8) Sage installations.  And doesn't hurt anyway, just makes Sage more robust.

It does hurt at least a little simply because it makes `spkg-install` and `SPKG.txt` larger than needed.  I would remove it (but I'm not setting the ticket to needs_work for this).

Of course.  But regarding such, I wouldn't have opened dozens of tickets and touched as many spkgs for the "newer autotools `--libdir` issue"; a single symbolic link from `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` to `./lib` would have sufficed, as we don't mix 32- and 64-bit builds anyway.

I don't think it's asking for trouble, but see the *Special !Update/Build Instructions* / TODO.

I so far was just too lazy, and -- more important -- didn't want to remove Dave's messages and comments... ;-)

It would have been better if you made a p3, and not deleted my diff with the changes of my p2.

I agree with some, but not all of your changes:

* There's no need to remove the conditional unsetting of `PYTHON`, as I already argued above.

* I wouldn't add a patch for the `.asm` files, but instead "patch" them (with `sed`) on the fly.  Otherwise this just blows up the Mercurial repository, and hopefully upstream will fix this in the next release.  (MPIR 2.5.2 was originally scheduled for about one or two weeks ago.)

* Reading `CC` and `CFLAGS` *from system-wide `gmp.h` files* is also for informational purposes.  Using the strings from that header (and not MPIR's `Makefile`, which btw. could contain tabs as well) is the safer way, as these definitions are documented and **supposed** to be (easily read out and) used by other programs.  (The [structure of the] `Makefile` is subject to change without notice.)
  You should also check whether reading the `CFLAGS` from the `Makefile` apparently succeeded. 

* I don't know why you removed the `-march=native` stuff; I does in general make sense, especially since (at least the version in Sage -- also regarding how long it takes to get a "new" version in) will not always properly detect the CPU, i.e., will choose a more generic target CPU [family] than `-march=native` does.

* I'm pretty sure we still need a work-around for newer CPUs (and GCCs) on MacOS X, slightly different to what I previously added to the p2, at least to avoid strange error messages.

This can very well happen if e.g. the compiler defaults to some target CPU / instruction set the assembler doesn't fully support, and `CFLAGS` restrict the architecture.  Same for `CFLAGS` working around some brokenness of the compiler.

Anyway, this would probably \"blow up\" the Mercurial repository more than my .asm patch ;-)\n\n>  There's no need to remove the conditional unsetting of `PYTHON`, as I already argued above.\n\nI really don't see the need for the `PYTHON` stuff.  If somebody just installs this spkg with \"`./sage -i`\", then `PYTHON` will not be set.  `PYTHON` will only be set if this spkg is installed through `spkg/install`.  I cannot think of a plausable scenario where this would happen.\n\n>  I wouldn't add a patch for the `.asm` files, but instead \"patch\" them (with `sed`) on the fly.  Otherwise this just blows up the Mercurial repository\n\nThe patch isn't that large, so it's not going to \"blow up\" the Mercurial repository.  Besides, I don't want to worry about the portability of the find/sed commands that I'm using.\n\n>  Reading `CC` and `CFLAGS` *from system-wide `gmp.h` files* is also for informational purposes.\n\nWho reads log files anyway?\n\n> Using the strings from that header (and not MPIR's `Makefile`, which btw. could contain tabs as well) is the safer way, as these definitions are documented and **supposed** to be (easily read out and) used by other programs.  (The [structure of the] `Makefile` is subject to change without notice.)\n\nAgreed that it's subject to change without notice, but at least we'll notice if it changes.  Reading them from Makefile is absolutely the easiest way.\n\n> You should also check whether reading the `CFLAGS` from the `Makefile` apparently succeeded. \n\nThis is harder to do.  In theory, `CFLAGS` could be empty.  Moreover, it looks quite unlikely to me that reading `CC` would succeed but reading `CFLAGS` would fail.\n\n>  I don't know why you removed the `-march=native` stuff;\n\nI removed it because it wasn't used!  Reading the CC and CFLAGS from MPIR should always succeed now (as far as I can tell), so the code using `-march=native` would never be reached.\n\n> I does in general make sense, especially since (at least the version in Sage -- also regarding how long it takes to get a \"new\" version in) will not always properly detect the CPU, i.e., will choose a more generic target CPU [family] than `-march=native` does.\n\nPerhaps always using `-march=native` does make sense, but that's outside the scope of this ticket.\n\n>  It's not necessary to move the work-around for GCC 4.7.x on ia64, as we don't support Itanium on anything but Linux.\n\nSo what?  Why *a priori* restrict it to Linux?\n\n> Moreover, using the odd `testcc.sh` script fails if `$CC` contains more than one word\n\nAgreed, `$CC` should be quoted.\n\n> using shell pattern matching is not only more efficient\n\nSeriously?

Since your changes weren't committed, I thought it was open to changes.  Anyway, this would probably "blow up" the Mercurial repository more than my .asm patch ;-)

>  There's no need to remove the conditional unsetting of `PYTHON`, as I already argued above.

I really don't see the need for the `PYTHON` stuff.  If somebody just installs this spkg with "`./sage -i`", then `PYTHON` will not be set.  `PYTHON` will only be set if this spkg is installed through `spkg/install`.  I cannot think of a plausable scenario where this would happen.

>  I wouldn't add a patch for the `.asm` files, but instead "patch" them (with `sed`) on the fly.  Otherwise this just blows up the Mercurial repository

The patch isn't that large, so it's not going to "blow up" the Mercurial repository.  Besides, I don't want to worry about the portability of the find/sed commands that I'm using.

>  Reading `CC` and `CFLAGS` *from system-wide `gmp.h` files* is also for informational purposes.

Who reads log files anyway?

> Using the strings from that header (and not MPIR's `Makefile`, which btw. could contain tabs as well) is the safer way, as these definitions are documented and **supposed** to be (easily read out and) used by other programs.  (The [structure of the] `Makefile` is subject to change without notice.)

Agreed that it's subject to change without notice, but at least we'll notice if it changes.  Reading them from Makefile is absolutely the easiest way.

> You should also check whether reading the `CFLAGS` from the `Makefile` apparently succeeded. 

This is harder to do.  In theory, `CFLAGS` could be empty.  Moreover, it looks quite unlikely to me that reading `CC` would succeed but reading `CFLAGS` would fail.

>  I don't know why you removed the `-march=native` stuff;

I removed it because it wasn't used!  Reading the CC and CFLAGS from MPIR should always succeed now (as far as I can tell), so the code using `-march=native` would never be reached.

> I does in general make sense, especially since (at least the version in Sage -- also regarding how long it takes to get a "new" version in) will not always properly detect the CPU, i.e., will choose a more generic target CPU [family] than `-march=native` does.

Perhaps always using `-march=native` does make sense, but that's outside the scope of this ticket.

>  It's not necessary to move the work-around for GCC 4.7.x on ia64, as we don't support Itanium on anything but Linux.

So what?  Why *a priori* restrict it to Linux?

> Moreover, using the odd `testcc.sh` script fails if `$CC` contains more than one word

Agreed, `$CC` should be quoted.

Seriously?  You're worrying about efficientcy of shell scripts?

I find my code quite readable.

Let's see what users report...  It doesn't make sense to me to add a complicated workaround for a corner case which doesn't occur in practice.

The raw patch alone is 32 KB.  If one makes changes to other people's code, one should always make a diff; that's what reviewer patches are for.  I also wanted to make further changes.  Apart from that, it's confusing to have different spkgs with the same patch level at different locations.

Is it?  You use almost the same `sed` commands.  And it's more error-prone; just imagine we have

```make
CFLAGS = -foo -bar # This is a comment.
```
Then `mpir_cflags` would certainly not be empty, but ... (Likewise for `CC`.)  Even the usage of one or more tabs can break your code.

See above.  A tab character is sufficient, a comment leads to weird errors later.

> I removed it because it wasn't used!  Reading the CC and CFLAGS from MPIR should always succeed now (as far as I can tell), so the code using `-march=native` would never be reached.

That was true for my p2 (provided `upstream_cflags` weren't empty), and was subject to change, as I didn't notice that in the first place.  And as you mentioned, MPIR's `CFLAGS` may not contain processor-specific flags.  Different compilers might use / need different flags, and the code was open for extensions regarding that.

I didn't know you were porting MacOS to Itanium (a dead architecture btw.)...

Perhaps rather change `testcc.sh`, although

```sh
if $CC -E -x c /dev/null -dM 2>&1 | grep __GNUC__ >/dev/null; then
    # It's GCC.
    ...
fi
```
does it, and is much simpler.

You mean like e.g.

```sh
if [ -n "$AS" -a "$AS" != "as" ]; then ...
```
instead of

```sh
if [[ $AS != as ]]; then ...
```
or

```sh
    arg=`echo "$arg" | sed \
        -e 's/^-\(compatibility_version\)/-dylib_\1/' \
        -e 's/^-\(current_version\)/-dylib_\1/' \
        -e 's/^-\(install_name\)/-dylib_\1/' \
```
instead of

```sh
    case "$arg" in
        -compatibility_version) arg=-dylib_compatibility_version;;
        -current_version)       arg=-dylib_current_version;;
        -install_name)          arg=-dylib_install_name
    esac

Well, it's certainly a corner case (btw. like most of the regularly occuring MacOS trouble ;-) ), but it did happen, so I added a test to catch it, give an appropriate message, and work around it.

This is all true, but the point is that MPIR (actually, automake) doesn't put those comments, nor do they use TABs.  We cannot predict how `Makefile` will look like in the future, but we also cannot predict how `gmp.h` or `mpir.h` will look like in the future.  I think it is very unlikely that a future MPIR will break my script in a way that nobody notices.

> Is it?  But removing the code *is* in its scope?

The removed code wasn't used.  Feel free to make a new MPIR spkg to re-enable `-march=native`.  Even better: fix the upstream code to add `march=native` if supported.

Justin Walker reported success on OS X 10.7 with my previous .p2 spkg (essentially equal to the current .p3).  The relevant part of the log:

I restored the `unset PYTHON` part.

I also added a check for `-mpower*` flags in spkg-install, as MPIR adds `-mpowerpc` on 32-bit PowerPC systems (at least on Skynet silius in 32-bit mode).

The spkg is still in the same location, needs review.

This doesn't make sense at all.  Why do you refuse to use the documented, supposed (and hence safest) way (or location) to get the flags from?  (And it's in no way more complicated than what you currently do.  You could of course also run the preprocessor on `gmp.h`, but that's IMHO slight overkill.)

The structure and/or contents of the generated Makefiles is likely to change with other versions of autotools, probably without intent of the MPIR developers.

In any case, you should have just changed the `get_upstream_selected_cflags()` function, instead of removing it.

---

You should also add `-mno-power*` to `get_processor_specific_cflags()`, since at least a user might use such.

The other changes are reasonable, so I'm ok with the spkg modulo the useless changes w.r.t. extracting `CFLAGS` (and as already mentioned, I'd just change the `.asm` files on the fly, not add a large patch which is under revision control for that*).

Don't know whether we should `cat` the whole `config.log` in case `configure` failed in the first place; I'd just print its full filename (and we don't have to "rename" it), like we do in some other spkgs.


[* The "autotools way" would by the way be to check whether m4 bails out on `define(,1)`, and only if that's the case, modify the offending source files.]

Well, printing the path to `config.log` in case the first `configure` run failed is certainly a minor issue (although adding it is a minor change which wouldn't need large-scale testing as well).

Volker said he was waiting for the changes to be committed, and I haven't looked at the latest spkg (w.r.t. usual spkg sanity checks) myself, otherwise I would have set it to positive review already.

So I just don't know whether you were planning to make some further changes, and/or commit them.

FWIW, the current(?) p3 spkg (md5sum `45bd5544cfa568e1d7752f335495c336`) looks technically sane to me (except that the changes aren't committed yet).

Replying to [comment:69 vbraun]:
> I think this ticket shows that there is a need for a better management of C(XX)FLAGS in Sage. Ideally via some shell script that is part of Sage, so that not every spkg has to reinvent the wheel. The whole approach of parsing the install of another spkg to recreate its CFLAGS is just wrong [...]


See #12890 for a partial reply.




W.r.t. "parsing the install of another spkg":

No spkg does this.  Some use preprocessor variables defined in other [s]pkgs' C headers, some use Python files of another, or use Python's `Makefile` settings through distutils, some even link to another's library and call functions for that purpose, others e.g. use `pkgconfig`.  Whether MPFR's, MPC's and GMP-ECM's (upstream) behaviour is *appropriate for Sage* has already been discussed elsewhere.

The specific problem with MPIR (similar to those with MPFR etc.) simply is that it by default doesn't allow to **add** or override *some* `CFLAGS`.  Therefore we have to cheat it by feeding it with its own, slightly modified flags after doing a "dry" build (i.e., running `configure` once just to see what flags it otherwise would use).


What Jeroen calls "good `CFLAGS`" are basically `-march=...`(-related) parameters.  Also depending on MPIR's age (especially within Sage), these aren't always optimal.  Further, most of MPIR is implemented in assembly language, where `CFLAGS` are almost completely irrelevant.
