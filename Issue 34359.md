Please do not modify stream.py right now, this might hold up the long chain of tickets fixing really evil bugs, culminating in #34552.

In `dev_tools.py`, it is unclear why you do not replace object in the following line

```
    for obj in itertools.chain.from_iterable(expand_comma_separated_names(object)
                                             for object in objects):
```

(although I admit it is unclear to me, why you replace object at all)

once done, we will be able to check that nobody uses the obsolete syntax `class C(object):` anymore.
