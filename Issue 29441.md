This should be your problem: In `OreFunctionField._element_constructor_`, you need to change

```diff
-self.Element(self, *args, **kwds)
+self.element_class(self, *args, **kwds)
```

This also needs to be changed for `OrePolynomialRing._element_constructor_`:

```diff
-C = self.Element
+C = self.element_class
```


One other thing: the `extend_to_fraction_field` needs doctests.

There were already doctests. But I've added one more.
