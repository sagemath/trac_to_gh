There will always be a need for this until it happens. We had another ticket opened for it in #29119. Setuptools can only badly pretend to be autotools, and pip will never be able to handle non-python dependencies. It's being cleverly faked in #29039, wherein we download a copy of sage-the-distribution and run its autotools build system to create a python file to be used by sagelib to... avoid just using autotools in sagelib. But one can imagine a world without the extra step.

That said, everyone is working on that, and no one is working on this, so there's not much point in keeping it open.
