# Issue 19966: LPCleanDictionary - floating-point helper class for interactive simplex method

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20203

Original creator: mkoeppe

This module provides a "clean" dictionary view on a dictionary with
floating-point numbers.  Cleaning means to change almost-zeros to exact
zeros, allowing the Interactive Simplex Method to recognize primal and
dual feasibility and to avoid pivoting on zero pivot elements.

(Split out from the larger ticket #18804.)

To be done:

- Tests should be based on normal dictionaries, not the backend dictionaries from #18804
- Perhaps have InteractiveLPProblem use LPCleanDictionary automatically when field is inexact

Needs more work. The interface has changed and it is now necessary to implement methods `row_coefficients`, `column_coefficients` instead of `leaving_coefficients`, `entering_coefficients`. Also need to use these new methods in the `dictionary()` method. And it needs an `__eq__` method.

It is not developed further in #18804 which points to https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-interactive-mip.
