This module provides a "clean" dictionary view on a dictionary with
floating-point numbers.  Cleaning means to change almost-zeros to exact
zeros, allowing the Interactive Simplex Method to recognize primal and
dual feasibility and to avoid pivoting on zero pivot elements.

(Split out from the larger ticket #18804.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20203

Needs more work. The interface has changed and it is now necessary to implement methods `row_coefficients`, `column_coefficients` instead of `leaving_coefficients`, `entering_coefficients`. Also need to use these new methods in the `dictionary()` method. And it needs an `__eq__` method.
