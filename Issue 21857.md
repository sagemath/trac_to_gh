Untested hypothesis: the "Discovering !Python/Cython source code" part below is run **before** auto-generating the sources, which is the wrong order:

```
print("Discovering Python/Cython source code....")
t = time.time()
from sage_setup.find import find_python_sources
python_packages, python_modules = find_python_sources(
    SAGE_SRC, ['sage', 'sage_setup'])
```


The auto-generated files might not be discovered this way, leading to those files being considered for cleaning.

Here are some experiments regarding the reproductibility on my system (Ubuntu 16.04):
- the error seems systematic: i.e. running `MAKE="make -j8" make` in a new fresh git clone yields the same error; then running `make` finishes the build without any error
- to determine whether this due to the parallel build, I ran simply `make` in another fresh git clone: then the build crashes due to another error: the `psutil` one  reported in #22098

As for the parallel build, running `make` a second time leads to a successful build.
In other words, `make && make` works, while a single `make` fails...

It's not "Generating Interpreter Sources", it's "Generating auto-generated sources". So both the comment and the `print` statement are wrong in this regard.

Amusing considering I copied pasted the original `print` statement from Erik. I can see it was more general before #21613.

OK for the stopgap status. If Erik, think it can be done better he is welcome to do it, but it is the last blocker for 7.5 so getting things out is important. New commit coming soon.
