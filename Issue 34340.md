# Issue 34340: Fix warning messages, "-undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34577

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-09-23 21:38:15

We suppressed these warning messages in doctesting in #34533, but they also appear when building many parts of the Sage library. We should fix them.

A few comments:

- `git grep "dynamic_lookup"` didn't reveal much: we are not explicitly introducing the flag `--undefined dynamic_lookup`.
- If I search the log files for the warning, it seems to come up in Python-related packages. This is the list I see:

```
argon2_cffi-20.1.0.log
cffi-1.15.0.log
cvxopt-1.3.0.log
cypari-2.1.2.log
cysignals-1.11.2.log
cython-0.29.32.p1.log
fonttools-4.28.4.log
fpylll-0.5.7.log
gmpy2-2.1.1.log
iml-1.0.4p2.p2.log
kiwisolver-1.3.2.log
lrcalc_python-2.1.log
markupsafe-2.1.1.log
matplotlib-3.5.2.log
memory_allocator-0.1.3.log
numpy-1.22.4.log
pillow-9.0.1.log
pplpy-0.8.6.log
primecountpy-0.1.0.log
pyrsistent-0.18.1.log
pyzmq-23.2.0.log
rpy2-3.3.6.log
sagelib-9.7.log
scipy-1.8.1.log
tornado-6.1.log
```

 Python may be setting this flag. I thought I had read somewhere that Python packages were supposed to use this flag on OS X, but now I can't find it.
- [Emacs developers](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=57849) are also seeing this warning, in case their discussion sheds light for anyone else (it didn't for me).

I don't know if the right thing to do is to eliminate the flag `--undefined dynamic_lookup`, but it does seem to be set by Python. If I force Sage to build its own Python, then I get

```
% grep -I -l -R "undefined.*dynamic_lookup" venv/
venv//lib/python3.10/distutils/tests/test_unixccompiler.py
venv//lib/python3.10/distutils/spawn.py
venv//lib/python3.10/_sysconfigdata__darwin_darwin.py
venv//lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools/command/build_ext.py
venv//lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools/_distutils/util.py
venv//lib/python3.10/config-3.10-darwin/Makefile
```

and many of those look potentially relevant. Presumably the system-version of Python has something similar.

I will repair #33680 in the next minutes.
To avoid future conflicts, I suggest to add #33680 as a dependency of the current ticket.
