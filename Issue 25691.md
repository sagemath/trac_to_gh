Adding three posets to the poset catalog. One will generate the permutation pattern containment poset for all permutations up to a given size n. One will create an interval in the pattern containment poset given two permutations. One will create the occurence poset, which is similar to an interval in the pattern containment poset, except a designated occurence of the bottom element within the top element must be preserved (as in 'The Mobius Function of the Permutation Pattern Poset' by Steingrimmsson and Tenner).
