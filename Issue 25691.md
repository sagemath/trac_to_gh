# Issue 25691: Implement Permutation Pattern Posets

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kdilks

Original creation time: 2018-07-25 20:25:55

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: sagedays@ICERM

Adding three posets to the poset catalog. One will generate the permutation pattern containment poset for all permutations up to a given size n. One will create an interval in the pattern containment poset given two permutations. One will create the occurence poset, which is similar to an interval in the pattern containment poset, except a designated occurence of the bottom element within the top element must be preserved (as in 'The Mobius Function of the Permutation Pattern Poset' by Steingrimmsson and Tenner).

Currently have code to make these that works in the notebook, in the process of cleaning up and adding doctests before pushing a branch to trac.

Still need to clean up the docstrings a little (and add references), make sure I have sufficiently robust examples and tests of corner cases. Optimization/suggestions for the code itself currently welcome.

The table of contents/index/whatever for the poset_examples file is not creating links, but I can't see what's still broken and causing that to happen.

Spent way too long trying to figure out why the table of contents wasn't building with hyperlinks after my changes...before finding out the current version doesn't build with hyperlinks, either.

Hmm...strange. Well, here are a few tweaks. If my changes are good, then positive review.

Ping? Green bot (morally).

Been trying to get machines to build Sage without errors to check things, but I was ok with the changes from reading the diff.

The patchbot has done the checks IMO. (Feel free to send me an email with your Sage build issues.)

Before this gets positive: "occurrence" is spelled with two "r"s, whatever the math literature says :)

Mildly important since it appears in the name of a method.
