# Issue 22603: make tachyon properly handle LDFLAGS

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22840

this is very similar to #22812. Tachyon does not place LDFLAGS
in the right place in the makefile, making building fail on FreeBSD; this branch fixes this.

Follow up at #22860.

This broke the build on Cygwin after all (no problem--you had sought my input on this and I wasn't able to check it earlier, but now I can confirm...)

(To be clear, it's specifically linking of lcalc that broke; tachyon seems fine.)

On Cygwin, `$(LDFLAGS)` needs to come after `$(OBJECTS)`.  Would it break things on FreeBSD if we split the baby and duplicated `$(LDFLAGS)` on both sides of `$(OBJECTS)`? :)

does #22860 fix it on Cygwin?

lcalc build also seems to have broken on Linux as well, so it's not just Cygwin.

Oops--I didn't see #22860.  That will probably fix it, but I'll test.  Thanks.
