# Issue 21690: Unify and improve ModularSymbols_ambient.modular_symbols_of_level()

Keywords: modular symbols

The implementations of `modular_symbols_of_level` in various subclasses of `ModularSymbols_ambient` are very similar, but impose different conditions on the input (no condition for `Gamma0` and `Gamma1`; too strict for `GammaH`, see #21798).  This ticket does the following:
- move these methods, for spaces of modular symbols for congruence subgroups of type `Gamma0`, `Gamma1` and `GammaH`, to one method in `ModularSymbols_ambient`
- permit the level to be given as a congruence subgroup instead of an integer
- in any case, impose the condition that the old group contains the new group or vice versa.
The corresponding method for modular symbols with character is unchanged and overrides the one introduced here, since it operates with characters instead of the groups themselves.
