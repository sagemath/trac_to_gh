Overall this make target is problematic and it would be best to clean it up more thoroughly.

- It not only cleans (as the name of the target suggests) but actually uninstalls sagelib (in a rather brutal way)
- This is the same defect as noted in #21775 (make distclean: Don't delete $SAGE_ROOT/local)
- Also, it refers to `local` directly instead of using SAGE_LOCAL (which can be configured using `--prefix`)
- The latter is important for #29536 - make docker images from [GitHub](GitHub) CI workflow and regular Sage Docker images interoperable

Replying to [comment:11 chapoton]:
> looks good, but I cannot test

Some [GitLab](GitLab) pipelines are running and complete, e.g.
this one https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac/-/pipelines/221142937
for #30925


The pipeline for the current ticket is in the queue:
https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac/-/pipelines/221294945

I have no idea how many people are using these, and what it takes to test functionality of the current ticket there.
