As reported on asksage [1], the function `Graph.treewidth` can return incorrect tree decompositions.

The computations are actually done right (the width returned is correct), but my attempts to "simplify" the tree while it is being built simplified.. a bit too much.

The way it is done now is a bit more correct, though a tad more ressource-consuming. Nothing important, as the post-processing is infiinitely cheaper than the actual solving anyway.

Sorry about that.

I just rebased the patch over the latest beta and added a commit to fix that.

It is a rather good news, by the way: it means that the decompositions are smaller than previously.
