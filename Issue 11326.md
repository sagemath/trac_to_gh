See the attached PDF for an example of a class that has no `_latex_`. All commands are repeated twice, one with Sage-4.7 and the second one with the patch applied.

It is possible that user classes will not have customized latex method and there are some standard classes that use their string representation. If this representation includes multiple lines, the result in most cases is not very good and sometimes quite horrible, making it unpleasant to use the notebook in typeset mode. The patch aims to fix this situation and clean up latex module along the way.

Overall, this looks pretty good, but it could use some work.  Here are some comments.

- in html.py, the comments "We work around a limitation of jsmath (it can't typeset '\texttt')::" should be deleted, since those doctests don't involve texttt anymore.  (Do we even need to do the replacement `s.replace('\\texttt','\\hbox')` now, or can that code be deleted?)

- in latex.py, for bool_function and None_function, "\mathrm{%s}" is preferable to "{\rm %s}".  Actually, I think we can just return "\mathrm{%s}" always, regardless of notebook vs. command line distinctions.  Do you know why we had two versions for bool_function before?  It looks okay to me without the mbox...

- Finally, the output in one of the doctests,

```

```

 looks like bad latex: the "&lt;" inside of the \verb environment shouldn't be typeset correctly, but it actually seems to work.  I wonder why...

When we switch to MathJax (#9774), we'll have to redo some of this.

Thanks for the comments!

I don't know why there are differences for different modes, this is the first time I am working with these modules. I agree that the fewer are differences the better and will also remove the extra space.

Here is the reason for extra string conversion:

```
sage: s = "asdf fs"
sage: l = latex(s)
sage: print l
sage: print latex(l)
sage: print latex(str(l))
\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|
\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|
\verb"\verb|asdf|\phantom{x}\verb|fs|"
```

As I understand, the idea is that when user types `latex(x)` in the notebook, then (s)he wants to see the actual LaTeX code. So it will be wrapped the second time and displayed.

Regarding `&lt;` - it is not produced in normal LaTeX but can happen only in jsMath. For some reason it parses `<` even inside verb and the old solution was to insert extra spaces (which somehow prevents it from this mistake), but this alters the output and looks especially bad on typesetting things like `>=`. Replacing it with HTML code seems to work, I don't know why and I don't really care - once it is fixed upstream, we will see a doctest break and can remove this workaround. (Hopefully we can also get rid of phantoms eventually, but in MathJax the problem was still present two weeks ago.

Hi John, would you mind explaining to me how does your code work? I am not very familiar with regular expressions.

Also, how did you notice the new patch? It kind of annoys me that trac does not send messages when there are new patches attached to the tickets, so I usually leave some comment to trigger it. This time I was waiting since I didn't yet run tests on the whole library to see if anything got broke ;-)

I happened to take a look at the ticket, so I saw the new patch; mine is based on that one.

The documentation for regular expressions in Python is [here](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html).  In the code

```
if s.find('\\verb') != -1: 
    import re 
    s = re.sub("\\\\verb(.)(.*?)\\1", "\\2", s) 
    s = s.replace("\\phantom{x}", " ") 
```

the second and third lines are the ones involving regular expressions.  Line 3 is a search-and-replace command: it searches the argument s for a pattern `\verb` followed by a single character (that's the `.`), and putting that character in parentheses allows you to refer to it later as `\1`.  Then there are any number of characters (that's the `.*?`, also enclosed in parentheses, so you can refer to it later as `\2`), followed by whatever the first character was (that's the `\\1`).  It replaces all of this with the string in the second set of parentheses, `\2`.

There is one subtlety in this: the standard way to refer to any string of characters is `.*`, but the problem here is that in a string like

```
\verb|a|, \verb|b|
```

if we used `.*`, then the string \2 would match "a|, \verb|b" -- everything between the first "|" and the last "|": by default, regular expression matches use the longest match possible.  Using `.*?` instead of `.*` tells it to match the shortest string possible instead, so it does two replacements: first \2 matches "a", and then it matches "b", turning this into

```
a, b
```
