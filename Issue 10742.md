This makes sage-4.6.1 not build on ARM ; here is a patch that makes it build.

This makes sage-4.6.2 also not build on ARM ; the same patch works.

it looks quite harmless for non-ARM machines, so this can be included, IMHO. I can't test this on an ARM, though.

This patch looks geared towards atlas-3.9.32 does it apply to the current version in sage? And there should be a spkg.

Oops, my bad:â€“(
 I haven't noticed the wrong Atlas version.

The newly-released 4.7.1 still ships with an atlas which doesn't compile on ARM, so I came to check where that report stands ; is it sure that a fixed spkg will find its way into sage-4.7.2 ?

There are numerous problems with the atlas 3.9.xx series (it causes some strange behaviors in iml and linbox at least). As it stands we won't be using it for 4.7.2.

If you want to provide a patch against atlas-3.8.4, we could try to include that in 4.7.2 relatively quickly.

I'm still compiling sage 4.7.1 and it will probably wait until monday before I'm able to provide a cleaner patch than the one I currently use, but I'll work on one.

This patch to the atlas in 4.7.1 makes it possible to compile on ARM

<sup>^</sup> The patch described above is visibly clean, since it only modifies the code on ARM platforms

Thanks for the patch. I'll try to make a new spkg based on it so it can be included in 4.7.2.

The singular in 4.8, 3.8.4.p1, compiles correctly on ARM : please close that report as obsolete, invalid or some such.
