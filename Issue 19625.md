# Issue 19625: matrix.zero(15)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19862

Original creator: ncohen

This syntax is possible for `matrix.ones`, for `matrix.identity` (and others) but not for `matrix.zero`. More: the code is there to manage it, but there is no default for the value of `n`. This branch just adds it, with a doctest.
