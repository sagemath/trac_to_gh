# Issue 30623: SageMath-9.2 does not start with Jupyter on macOS 10.15.7

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30860

Keywords: openssl

Hi,

After upgrading from SageMath-9.1 to SageMath-9.2, 

./sage -n jupyter fails

 ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ssl'

The Jupyter notebook requires ssl, even if you do not use
https. Install the openssl development packages in your system and
then rebuild Python (sage -f python3).

I have tried to install openssl..1.1.1g (not_installed) but it has failed :

> [openssl-1.1.1g] Undefined symbols for
> architecture x86_64: ....
> [openssl-1.1.1g] ld: symbol(s) not
> found for architecture x86_64
> [openssl-1.1.1g] clang: error: linker
> command failed with exit code 1 (use
> -v to see invocation)

Does anyone know how to fix this ?

Thank you

Nota Bene : I may be using the wrong place to report this problem but I do know the right place to report it

Same issue when recompiling sage from sage-9.2.tar.gz

./configure --enable-openssl=yes

make

[patch-2.7.5] ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
