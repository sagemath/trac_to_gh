Keywords: discriminant beginner

Integer polynomials do not define a method `disc()`, yet rational polynomials do.


```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x^2+4
sage: f.discriminant()
-16
sage: f.disc()
AttributeError

sage: g=f.change_ring(QQ)
sage: g.disc()
-16
```


Adding `disc()` to the respective file for integer polynomials.
