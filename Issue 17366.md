# Issue 17366: disc() inconsistent for rational and integer polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17603

Original creator: boerner

Original creation time: 2015-01-08 15:47:15

CC:  saraedum

Keywords: discriminant beginner

Integer polynomials do not define a method `disc()`, yet rational polynomials do.


```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: f=x^2+4
sage: f.discriminant()
-16
sage: f.disc()
AttributeError

sage: g=f.change_ring(QQ)
sage: g.disc()
-16
```


Adding `disc()` to the respective file for integer polynomials.

There seem to be no commits on your branch, could you check that again?

`sage -br` currently fails.

```python
sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx:1082:13: Expected '(', found '='
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
Cython.Compiler.Errors.CompileError: sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx
```

the `def` in `def disc = discriminant` isn't needed, cf. polynomial_rational_flint.pyx.

And I have to apologize for the mess I made above. Got lost between two `screen` tabs...

Sorry, I forgot to check that the doc also builds.. well, fixed the issue now (and also linked the respective doctest to this ticket).
