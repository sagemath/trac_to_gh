As reported by Georgi Guninski:


```
sage: F=graphs.PathGraph(3);
sage: S='S';F.add_vertex(S);
sage: F.add_edges([(S,0)]);
sage: F2=Graph(F);
sage: F2.subdivide_edges(list(F2.edges(labels=False)),2);
sage: F2.degree()
[2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 5]
```


after relabel:

```
sage: F=graphs.PathGraph(3);
sage: S='S';
sage: F.add_vertex(S);
sage: F.add_edges([(S,0)]);
sage: F2=Graph(F);
sage: F2.relabel();
sage: F2.subdivide_edges(list(F2.edges(labels=False)),2);
sage: F2.degree()
[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```


This bug, as very often, happened because I am an idiot.
