Instead of putting more into the `bin/sage` script, wouldn't it make sense to actually extract all building and testing related code to tox? So instead of `sage -b` (`sage -t`) you run `tox build` (`tox test` respectively). This would leave the `sage` script only with the functionality that a user needs to *run* sage.

(also I don't see any advantages of `sage -tox pycodestyle` over `tox pycodestyle`)

Some projects are indeed using tox also for building, but I think I would like to keep it for testing only. At least for now - we can't make too many changes at the same time so that our developer community is not overwhelmed.

`sage -coverage` and `sage -startuptime`, however, should definitely become tox environments.

> (also I don't see any advantages of `sage -tox pycodestyle` over `tox pycodestyle`)

The difference is that `sage -tox` would also work with `src/tox.ini` when called from SAGE_ROOT. (There's another tox.ini in SAGE_ROOT for a different purpose - testing of the sage distribution.)

And it can give a hint to install tox when it is not available.

Looks good to me.

The only point where I'm not sure is whether the src/tox.ini file is really needed, or if it can be combined with the tox.ini in the root directory. Similarly, I'm not sure if sage -tox should always be relative to the tox config in the src folder.

Yes, I have been debating this with myself actually, but in the end I think it is important to keep src/tox.ini simple and readable -- the portability testing stuff in the root can be overwhelming to developers.

> Similarly, I'm not sure if sage -tox should always be relative to the tox config in the src folder.  

The purpose of this is to make it easy to run the tests on user code -- in the same way  that `sage -t` is often used.

not sure I  understand the errors from `pycodestyle` and  `startuptime` - do I have everything set up right?

Is it possible to do only, say, `pycodestyle` part?

---------

`pycodestyle` output kind of makes sense (except that `unknown option 'description' ignored` thing)

does `startuptime` only work for modules? (e.g. `sage/graphs/`) ?
