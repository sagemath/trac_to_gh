PARI just made a prerelease for version 2.9.2. When it is released, we should use this version in Sage. This will likely fix #22279.

I'm not sure but this might also fix #22635 if that gets incorporated into the final release.

The fix to #22633 is still held up for some reason, even though it has nothing directly to do with the concerns about emscripten.

#22633 will certainly not be fixed in 2.9.2 because my `PROT_NONE` patches are not in 2.9.2 either.

Okay, I thought that might be the case since there was still some question about it.

Apparently `prot_none_4.patch` is accepted upstream (seems to be `d42061c`). Are you sure it will be in a stable release?

1. This ticket here does not deal with `prot_none_4.patch` so why does it matter?

2. I cannot read the mind of the PARI developers, but I guess it will be in PARI 2.10

`prot_none_4.patch` included with commit `343f241` is part of the branch.

Of course not. But you can care about the future of your patches and ask to have it backported in stable releases.

It is always a mess to attribute commit to dependencies... how am I supposed to deal with that?

Now, waiting for the testsuite...

I don't know what you are seeing. There is only one commit and it does not involve `prot_none_4.patch`.

There are two commits on `u/jdemeyer/upgrade_pari_to_version_2_9_2` on top of 8.0.beta1

Right. I understand what you mean now. I usually look at the branch on Trac and that shows only one commit.

Anyway, this review is only about https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=543c4a1889f21b35483b0bf45e7dbcdb6ce25582
