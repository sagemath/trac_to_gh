# Issue 30763: Provide macOS app again

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31000

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-12-03 22:06:38

CC:  slelievre kcrisman dunfield

Keywords: macOS, app

This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.

Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

This actually works!  No small feat.  Tested on High Sierra - very painless installation, jsmol and threejs work, very basic math goes fine in Jupyter and command line.  Not even any warnings from Apple, again no small feat.  Obviously not as fully featured as the previous app, but given that sagenb is now dead and many of the other features may not have been used as much, definitely much preferable to not having anything for Mac users of this type.  Kudos!

Of course, the next question is whether eventually that project from the manifolds folks should be put into the Sage repo proper or not.  I guess that is more of a question for Matthias and those spearheading the modular install - for instance, would/should an eventual reprised Mac app include packages that in principle exist on a modern Mac, such as Python 3 or git - or should one rely on being able to install command line tools?  (My vote would be for having one that requires zero command line available as an option, as that was very useful in many circumstances, especially for beginners, but I assume I don't get a say since I no longer can actively develop at this time.)
