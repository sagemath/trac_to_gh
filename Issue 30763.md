Keywords: macOS, app

This ticket is to track reviving the macOS app.

Possibly as an independent project.

One model is [Gap.app](https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/),
a standalone app for GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe,
downloadable either bundled with GAP, or by itself
to make it work with an existing GAP installation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31000
