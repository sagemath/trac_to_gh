As discussed on #15105, Debian splits the GAP installation into `lib` and `share`. 
We could do the same.

This should be done upstream and not just in Sage.

The problem here is that the upstream's milestone for this to happen is apparently "Ice age in Hell"...

If upstream doesn't care, why should Sage care? If you move away from upstream's install system, there should be a reason for that. And "just because Debian does it" is not sufficient reason IMHO.

Do you think they would accept a pull request to make the installation more sane?

Either before or after the heat death of the universe ;-)

Sanitizing the gap directory structure is likely to break some GAP third-party packages that expect said layout...
