In this patch the nth-root of power series `y = x^n` is introduced using
the Newton method for `y = x^-n`

```
x' = (1+1/n)*x - y*x^(n+1)/n               (1)
```



```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^3
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^-3
sage: p.nth_root(-3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
```


The iterations are division-free;
in the case `n=2` one can compare this division-free iteration
with the iteration used in the Newton method for `sqrt`

```
x' = (x +y/x)/2                            (2)
```



`nth_root` can be used to compute the square root of series which
currently `sqrt` does not support

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: p = 1 + x*t + (x^2+y^2)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p1 = p.nth_root(2); p1
1 + 1/2*x*t + (3/8*x^2 + 1/2*y^2)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p1^2
1 + x*t + (x^2 + y^2)*t^2 + O(t^3)
```


In particular it can be used in the multivariate series considered
in ticket #1956 .

The nth-root of power series `y = x^n` is computed using
the Newton method for `y = x^-n`


```
x' = (1+1/n)*x - y*x^(n+1)/n
```



```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^3
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = (1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4))^-3
sage: p.nth_root(-3)
1 + 2*t + 5*t^2 + 7*t^3 + O(t^4)
```



With this patch `nth_root` works also for series on `ZZ`


```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: p = 1 + 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
1 + 2*t^2 + 3/2*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(3)
1 + 4/3*t^2 + t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p = 4*t^2 + 3*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2*t + 3/4*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p.sqrt(2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```


there is a bug in `sqrt` in this case.

`nth_root` can be used to compute the square root of series which
currently `sqrt` does not support

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<t> = R[[]]
sage: p = 4 + t*x + t^2*y + O(t^3)
sage: p.nth_root(2)
2 + 1/4*x*t + (-1/64*x^2 + 1/4*y)*t^2 + O(t^3)
sage: p = 32*t^5 + x*t^6 + y*t^7 + O(t^8)
sage: p.nth_root(5)
2*t + 1/80*x*t^2 + (-1/6400*x^2 + 1/80*y)*t^3 + O(t^4)
sage: p.sqrt()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular' object has no attribute 'sqrt'
```


`nth-root` iteration formula is division-free, which is convenient in this
case; in this case `sqrt`  could call `nth_root`.


`nth_root` can be used in the multivariate series considered
in ticket #1956 .

The speedup is large because the terms with high degree in `t`
are large polynomials, due to the combinatorial
possibilities with several variables; using _mul_ instead of _mul_trunc
several products involving these large polynomials are computed and
later truncated away.
