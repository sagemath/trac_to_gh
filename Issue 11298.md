Ah, I see above that FF works.

Well, I don't know if this is a browser-specific  bug, or if there is a real bug that FF is being lenient on.  If the latter, we should still fix our codebase, for sure.

#11343 (the 3-months old part of the discussion there) is quite informative about the browser-specific reasons for this.
As you see, #11343 disables new registrations using `@`, while still allowing the existing ones to work.
So you merged #11343 into the flask version, right? Then I would like to put this ticket on the wish-list, and be done with it for the time being.

Hi Karl-Dieter,

The 1st part of the diff is irrelevant, because it is the diff of the file obtained from the 2nd file, by some kind of preprocessing, called minification,  improving the performance (something akin to .pyc vs .py files in Python). 

Jason, by the way, what is the reason to distribute the 1st file, shouldn't it be created at installation time?

For the purposes of testing, the 1st file can be replaced with the 2nd at no loss.

You can take the diff, and apply it using good old patch tool, too.

You can test with the old sagenb,  by installing the new sagenb and applying the patch via git, then replacing the tiny_mce you have in the old sagenb with this new one, that is, the whole devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/tiny_mce/

Or, even easier, unpack the new sagenb spkg, and apply the patch manually, then  replace the tiny_mce you have in the old sagenb with this new one, that is, the whole devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/tiny_mce/
