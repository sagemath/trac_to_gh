# Issue 22805: Seealso-block for is_constructible_by_doublings()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This patch will add "stronger properties" -line to seealso-block of is_constructible_by_doublings(). Not very nice, but I can't invent better way. Ideas are welcome.

What about "not"-implications? If a lattice _is_ simple, it _is not_ doubling constructible. How to say that, or to say nothing?

How about "necessary" and/or "sufficient" properties?

Sorry, I didn't understand.

Actually, those don't quite work...maybe "negative properties" or "contrapositive properties"?

Like this? I guess this could be a good phrasing.

Arghs, again something wrong with git... Anyways, you can see the idea.

I do not understand what this means..

I guess this depends on the implications, if it is only one direction or both. It might not be worthwhile to come up with a name for something like "weaker but opposite", but "contrapositive" is definitely not correct in that case. For that, maybe "obstruction properties"? We might also be overengineering this and should just have a generic "related properties".

"Related properties" has slightly different meaning.

Of course we logically have no "yes"- and "no"-properties: we could have `is_nonmodular` that would imply `is_nondistributive` etc.

"Excluding properties"?

incompatible properties ?

To me it sounds weird. I would understood it in function parameters, like in `Posets.RandomLattice(3, properties=['complemented'])`.
