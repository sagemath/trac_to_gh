CC:  @a-andre

Keywords: python3

In Py2 `filter()` returns a list, while in Py3 `filter()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.ifilter()` does in Py2).

The tool 2to3 wraps `filter()` usages with a call to `list()`.


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import filter` and to check where a wrapping with `list()` is required.

There are 53 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

`2to3` does even better as its documentation [2to3 filter](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/2to3.html#2to3fixer-filter) suggests:

"Wraps filter() usage in a list call."

Often it changes the code as indicated by [filter()](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#filter):


"Note that `filter(function, iterable)` is equivalent to `[item for item in iterable if function(item)]` if function is not `None` and `[item for item in iterable if item]` if function is `None`."

This is more readable and more pythonic as a combination of `filter` and `lamda`.
And it allows sometimes further improvements!

Hi,
please change `==None` back to `is None` in `src/sage/combinat/k_tableau.py`.

Could you check that the indentions are correct, e.g. in `src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py`:

```
match_list = [s for s in match_list if re.search(extra, s[1],
                                  re.MULTILINE | flags)]
```

should be

```
match_list = [s for s in match_list if re.search(extra, s[1],
                                                 re.MULTILINE | flags)]
```
