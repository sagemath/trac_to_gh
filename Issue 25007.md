By the way, I would be interested in having a reasonable "is_congruence_uniform" method.

And if you have some time, would you please try #24994 ?

Do you mean `is_uniform` or `is_constuctible_by_doublings`?

> And if you have some time, would you please try #24994 ?

I can try, but never before looked at IPython code.
