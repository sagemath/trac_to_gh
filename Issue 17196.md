Since the coordinates of the points are lifted, the current equality check fails to detect equality over quotient rings. The comparisons need to be done in the base ring.


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(Zmod(10),1)
p1=P(1/3,1)
p2=P.point([1,3],False)
p1==p2
```

The fix has the coordinate of the points in the base ring. This was true for fields but not for rings (the coordinates of quotient rings were lifted). Now it is consistent and this fixes the equality comparison as well.
