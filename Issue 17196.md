# Issue 17196: projective point equality fails for quoteitn base rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17433

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2014-12-02 21:16:14

Assignee: bhutz

Since the coordinates of the points are lifted, the current equality check fails to detect equality over quotient rings. The comparisons need to be done in the base ring.


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(Zmod(10),1)
p1=P(1/3,1)
p2=P.point([1,3],False)
p1==p2
```

The fix has the coordinate of the points in the base ring. This was true for fields but not for rings (the coordinates of quotient rings were lifted). Now it is consistent and this fixes the equality comparison as well.

Looked over the code, everything ran clean on my end

**Ping** Plus a rebase is needed.

I thought I did a bad job on the merge since it still wasn't merging with the master. So I backed up one commit and redid the merge. I did resolve what I thought was the conflict in projective_point.py both times...

ok. I think I finally have the merge working. I had to split it slightly into two commits.

No merge problems (sometimes trac can be fickle). Also I allowed myself to do some trivial whitespace changes.
