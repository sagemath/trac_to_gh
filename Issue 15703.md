So we can do things like this:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['A',3,1], [[2,2],[1,1],[1,1]])
sage: elt = RC(partition_list=[[3,1], [3], [1]])
sage: elt

-3[ ][ ][ ]-3
-1[ ]-1

1[ ][ ][ ]1

-1[ ]-1

sage: RiggedConfigurations.global_options(display="horizontal", convention="french")
sage: elt
-1[ ]-1         1[ ][ ][ ]1   -1[ ]-1
-3[ ][ ][ ]-3
```
