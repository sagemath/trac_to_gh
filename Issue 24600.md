Keywords: days93

Following #22572, we can improve the output of the pretty print:


```
    sage: Nice_repr = TCube.repr_pretty_Hrepresentation(separator='\n')
sage: print(Nice_repr)
1 >= x0
1 >= x1
3*x1 + 7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x2
x0 + 1 >= 0
x1 + 1 >= 0
3*x0 + 7 >= 3*x1 + 3*x2
3*x0 + 3*x1 + 7 >= 3*x2
3*x0 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x1
3*x0 + 3*x1 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 0
x2 + 1 >= 0
1 >= x2
3*x1 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x0
3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x1
7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x1 + 3*x2
```

Once the tutorial is merged in #22572, we should change the "tips" page accordingly...

There was one doctest failing and a bit whitespace left. Other than that I think this is good to go. Set it on positive review on my behalf if you agree!

The last bot test looks good. I'm setting it to positive review.

Two trivial failures; see patchbot for details:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 49.3 src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/geometry/tips.rst  # 2 doctests failed
```

Should now work...

There are two pyflakes warnings about the usage of `QQ` and `RDF`.

Question: if they are used in doctests, that's not necessary to import them, correct?

If so, I'd just remove them...

Please do. What is imported in a file and what used in doctests, which is the global namespace, are essentially independent. Once you remove them, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Sounds good! I just wanted to make sure...

There is a follow-up ticket #26141 concerning the code quality.
