Keywords: days93

Following #22572, we can improve the output of the pretty print:


```
    sage: Nice_repr = TCube.repr_pretty_Hrepresentation(separator='\n')
sage: print(Nice_repr)
1 >= x0
1 >= x1
3*x1 + 7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x2
x0 + 1 >= 0
x1 + 1 >= 0
3*x0 + 7 >= 3*x1 + 3*x2
3*x0 + 3*x1 + 7 >= 3*x2
3*x0 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x1
3*x0 + 3*x1 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 0
x2 + 1 >= 0
1 >= x2
3*x1 + 3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x0
3*x2 + 7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x1
7 >= 3*x0 + 3*x1 + 3*x2
```
