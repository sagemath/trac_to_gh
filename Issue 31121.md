(from #31132)

gentoo appears to use this flag, which is redundant but harmless.

```


and after either `./configure` or `./configure --with-system-python3=yes` I have

```
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++ -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed conftest.dir/temp.linux-x86_64-3.9/conftest.o -L/usr/lib64 -o conftest.dir/lib.linux-x86_64-3.9/config_check_distutils_cxx.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
        LDFLAGS = "-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L."
configure:32030: result: no, this is a misconfigured Python whose sysconfig compiler/linker flags contain -I or -L options, which may cause wrong versions of libraries to leak into the build of Python packages - see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31132; to use it anyway, use ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3
```

Did you run `./bootstrap`?

Replying to [comment:5 mkoeppe]:
> Did you run `./bootstrap`?
That was it.

```
configure:39140: result: python3-3.9.1:                               using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```

Thanks
