# Issue 30197: Factorization over C doesn't work

```
a,b=var("a,b")
(a^2-2*I*a*b-b^2).factor()
((a-I*b)^2).expand()
```

outputs

```
a^2 - 2*I*a*b - b^2
a^2 - 2*I*a*b - b^2
```

So "factor" doesn't work correctly in this case.

Note that

```
sage: (a^2-2*I*a*b-b^2)._fricas_().factor().sage()                              
(I*a + b)^2
sage: (a^2-2*I*a*b-b^2)._giac_().factor().sage()                                
(a - I*b)^2
```
