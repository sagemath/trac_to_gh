Mainly because the constructor of matrices changed

```
      File "sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx", line 304, in sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense.__init__ (build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.c:4524)
        def __init__(self, parent, entries=None, *, bint copy=False, bint coerce=False, bint mutable=True):
    TypeError: __init__() takes at most 2 positional arguments (4 given)
```

See [quasar short log](https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/Ubuntu/16.04/x86_64/4.4.0-116-generic/quasar/2018-03-11%2011:19:34?short)

I guess that's the change in matrix initialisation introduced by Jeroen. But hasn't that been tested with optional matrix backends?

I just did :-) One problem is that on the previous beta, there was a constant failure on patchbots (#24918). Hence the patchbot quasar (running with all optional packages) was off. Until everybody agrees that each beta must pass with all optional packages you will have to wait (see [how much do we support optional packages](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/oDJS-7R0qzE) and #23832).

Sorry for that...

This is actually fixed in #24742. Should I create a separate fix for just this issue or does anybody plan to review #24742?

Better to have a fix in an independent ticket (this one). #24742 is likely to take more time.

Changing component from packages: optional to linear algebra.

Actually #24918 is not merged in the new beta so that the patchbots are still useless.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Interestingly, this failure is caused by the combination of two merged tickets, each of which individually passed the testsuite. This is just to say that even a perfect patchbot cannot catch everything.

If I understand correctly, you added your commit on 11th of March, but the patchbot gets errors on 12th of March.

However, both tests failures that I see are in `test(interacts.statistics.coin)`, which apparently is unrelated with this ticket. And the commit looks good to me.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.
