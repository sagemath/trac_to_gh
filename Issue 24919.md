I'm just starting to use Trac, and I'm not sure if my github-linked account is setup right.

I think I just pushed a git patch to fix this defect, but I expected to see some kind of notification here and haven't.

I got an error message during the push "remote: error: hook declined to update"

If you don't have the patch, please let me know.

When you do a reviewer patch, someone else needs to review your patch.

In this case, a blank line is missing in the formatting of the doctest,
and the wording could be improved.

Instead of

```
        See :trac:`25156`::
            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```

we should have

```
        Check that :trac:`25156` is fixed::

            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```

(note the blank line after `::` and before the start of the doctest block).
