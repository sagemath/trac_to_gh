# Issue 24919: multivariate power series rings don't always format latex properly

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @BrentBaccala

Original creation time: 2018-04-12 18:30:55

Keywords: latex, multivariate power series

Multivariate power series ring elements don't use latex formatting for infinite precision objects.



```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: R.<x,y> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
sage: element = 1 + y^10
sage: latex(element)
1 + y^10
sage: 

```


Notice the lack of braces around the number 10.

I'm just starting to use Trac, and I'm not sure if my github-linked account is setup right.

I think I just pushed a git patch to fix this defect, but I expected to see some kind of notification here and haven't.

I got an error message during the push "remote: error: hook declined to update"

If you don't have the patch, please let me know.

It seems your patch did not make it to Sage's trac server. There
might be clues in the sage-devel discussion from last February:

OK, I think I pushed the patch, but didn't set the branch on the ticket.

Right. If that's enough to fix the issue, you should set the ticket to 'needs_review'.

Needs review.  OK.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

You also need to put your full name in the "Authors" field.
(Once done, check it carefully to make sure it has no typos!)

Changing keywords from "latex, multivariate power series" to "latex, multivariate power series, beginner".

This would be an ideal ticket for a beginner developer to review, for
instance one of our Google-summer-of-code internship applicants.

Add a doc test illustrating fix, and add trac number

When you do a reviewer patch, someone else needs to review your patch.

In this case, a blank line is missing in the formatting of the doctest,
and the wording could be improved.

Instead of

```
        See :trac:`25156`::
            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```

we should have

```
        Check that :trac:`25156` is fixed::

            sage: R.<x1,y1> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, ('x', 'y'))
```

(note the blank line after `::` and before the start of the doctest block).
