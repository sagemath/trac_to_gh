The type of return value of some functions (`polylog`, `zeta`) is inconsistent:

```
sage: zeta(1)
Infinity
sage: zeta(1.)
+infinity
sage: polylog(1,1)
Infinity
sage: polylog(1.,1.)
+infinity
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

Polylog uses zeta here, so it's mainly because of `RR(1).zeta()` not being converted in `symbolic/function.pyx` or the `RR` functions not using the `InfinityRing` elements.

The problematic output is rather for the last lines, ie symbolic input, which should produce symbolic output. It does, by wrapping FP infinity into SR. It would be better if that would rather produce the infinity from the ring.
