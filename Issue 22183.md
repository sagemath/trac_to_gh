Changing keywords from "polytope, geometry" to "polytope, geometry, days84".

Sould this be merged in #20875 ?

Hmm. At the beginning, I listed some tickets there, this is true. Then, after looking at the description of #20875, I thought that the tickets I put were not directly in the description.

I planned to extend this list and to limit it to new methods implementations.

No big opinion, I simply thought to make this ticket a specific meta-ticket.

I've made some improvements to lattice polytopes recently, e.g. #22309 if you care to include it here as well.

Great! Thanks for the pointer!

Added 3 more tickets, a bunch of other optimizations and clean ups is almost ready but may take me a couple weeks to polish and post.

Managed polishing today and will stop until some kind reviewer will take a look, sorry for hijacking the ticket - I just now noticed that it is about new features ;-)

Don't worry it is good to keep track of open tickets!

I cleaned the tickets that are now solved.

Removed another batch of tickets.

I did some cleaning after the SageDays100 and version 8.9.beta7.

(See https://wiki.sagemath.org/OptiPolyGeom for a history)

Cleaned up the tickets that got merged in sage 8.9

Cleaned-up from 9.0. See https://wiki.sagemath.org/OptiPolyGeom for more details.

Cleaned some 9.1 tickets.

Thanks for cleaning.

Would someone be interested in writing a high-level section on polyhedral stuff for https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.1?

I did that. Anyone revision or improvement is welcome.

Very good revival (there used to be longer release notes... centuries ago)!

I'll have a look at what Jonathan did and add a few things. Perhaps it would be worth doing it for 9.0, for the sake of completeness and encouragement for people to do it too!

Yes, I think this would be valuable too.

Done. As before revision and/or improvements are welcome. Now the release note for 9.0 are almost only about polyhedral geometry, but at least they don't look as sad anymore. And maybe people get the idea that if there are that many changes just in polyhedral geometry than a lot of work has been done.
