Hmm. At the beginning, I listed some tickets there, this is true. Then, after looking at the description of #20875, I thought that the tickets I put were not directly in the description.

I planned to extend this list and to limit it to new methods implementations.

No big opinion, I simply thought to make this ticket a specific meta-ticket.

Very good revival (there used to be longer release notes... centuries ago)!

I'll have a look at what Jonathan did and add a few things. Perhaps it would be worth doing it for 9.0, for the sake of completeness and encouragement for people to do it too!
