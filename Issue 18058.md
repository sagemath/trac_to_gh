One bigger thing is that it seems like the description of the `SemistandardTableaux(6, max_entry=7).random_element()` was cutoff. Some smaller things:

- Instead of code formatting, use the link: `:class:`SemistandardTableau``.
- The `\t` is interpreted by python/sphinx as a tab character. To work around this, make the string a so-called "raw" string, start the docstring by `r"""`.
- The first sentence should be declarative: `Return` instead of `Returns`.
- In python, you don't need the parenthesis here: `while (randpos >= tot):`.
- Make `max_entry` in code formatting: ```max_entry```.
- Link to references by adding a trailing underscore: `[Krat99]_`.
- Could you make sure there's no trailing whitespace?

Looks good otherwise. Thanks.

I rebased on the latest beta and made some trivial changes, so I'm setting this to positive review. Thanks for implementing this.
