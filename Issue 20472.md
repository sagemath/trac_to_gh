according to the patchbot testing of #20668,

there remains a handful of problems in the documentation concerning
python(3 compatibility for print. Let us correct all of them,
except for one file in the tests for the French book.

I can look this. Btw, what is "2009 MBP"? Google founds MacBook Pro, is it that?

This is OK. You can set _positive_review_.

If you want, you can also remove `# long time (22s on 2009 MBP)`. It took 0,00 seconds on Optiplex 7010. CORRECTION: The timing was from cached result, and `# long time` is still needed.

ok, thanks Jori. I will leave the "long time" for the moment.

I can confirm the faster time on my laptop (~3 seconds), but it was long enough that IMO it should remain  `# long time`. (We've come a long way in 6 years :P)
