The doctest framework itself should not depend on matplotlib.

I'd find it very good if one could use the SageMath doctest framework with as few prerequisites as possible. So, if this branch makes it so that sympy and matplotlib are not required to run doctests, I am +1!

On the other hand: Both sympy and matplotlib are standard packages, and I don't see what harm would be done if Sage requires two of its standard packages to run tests.

There is harm if the **Sage doctesting framework** requires two of **Sage's** standard packages to run tests because the Sage doctesting framework is used for non-Sage tests too in #18514.

This ticket is not about p_group_cohomology. I don't think that the Sage doctesting framework should require all standard Sage packages.
