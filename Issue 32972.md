This is what I mean:

```diff
-        try:
-            Eq([xx, yy])
-        except Exception:
-            raise RuntimeError(f"Bug : Point ({xx, yy}) does not lie on the curve ")
+        assert Eq.defining_polynomial()(xx,yy,1) == 0, f"bug: point ({xx, yy}) does not lie on the curve {Eq}"
```

It's really no big deal.
