Keywords: Hyperelliptic curve

Mestre's algorithm for constructing hyperelliptic curves has been implemented see tickect #6341 but it only works for generic curve.


```
    .. TODO::
    
        Mestre's algorithm only works for generic curves of genus two, so an other algorithm is needed for those curves with extra automorphism
        
        sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(x^6+1)
        sage: HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants(C.igusa_clebsch_invariants()) # todo: not implemented
