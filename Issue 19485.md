# Issue 19485: Lee O'Sullivan interpolation algorithm for Guruswami-Sudan decoder

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19722

Original creator: dlucas

CC:  jsrn

This ticket introduces a new, faster algorithm for the interpolation step of the Guruswami-Sudan list decoder proposed in #19666, called Lee O'Sullivan algorithm.

The code proposed here relies extensively on the code written by Johan Nielsen in [codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib/). He wrote all the algorithms and mathematical content.

I pushed the patch, this ticket is now open for review. I modified the description because it also relies on #16896

Same thing that in #19666, I added myself as a reviewer because I read Johan's code while porting it, but I of course need someone to review my documentation and tests.

I pushed my branch again which it's been deleted, but now there is some conflict with the latest beta. I change this ticket to needs work until I fix this.

Hi, I've looked through the code and it looks good. I made a number of minor modifications directly. The most major are:

1. Rename "weight" to "shift". This is the standard nomenclature in computer algebra.
2. Remove support for fractional shifts in the helper methods of `utils.py`. This is not needed for Lee and O'Sullivan, and it simplifies those helpers a lot.

Apart from that, I just simplified a few things, renamed some things and reformulated some docs. I also elaborated some doc strings here and there, where I found that further details might be nice for the user.

I'm currently recompiling after `make distclean` and I will re-test and re-check documentation after that.

Fixed some last things wrt. documentation. All tests in `sage/coding` and all `src/doc` pass, and I'm testing the rest of the library now.

If you can agree to my changes, feel free to set the ticket to "positive review".
