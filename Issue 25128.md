More precisely, you need to choose between:

- Write a complete matrix class whose "backend" would be a NTL c++ class. You would have to inherit from `sage.matrix.matrix_dense.Matrix_dense`. A good example is provided with `Matrix_integer_dense` that wraps FLINT.

- Add some options to the methods of the current matrix classes to call NTL when appropriate. To that purpose, you have to convert the datastructure when needed. Some examples are also provided with `Matrix_integer_dense` that uses `iml` or `linbox`.

It is not clear to me why you need a Python wrapper to call a C++ NTL function. Converting a Sage matrix into a NTL `mat_ZZ_p` could be done without Python wrapper. At #24544 you can have a look at `sage/libs/linbox/conversion.pxd` that perform conversions `linbox C++ types <-> Sage types` without any intermediate Python wrapper. It saves a lot of code that boils down to

```
cdef class my_wrapping_class:
    def my_method(self):
        return self.wrapped_object.my_method()
```

If you want to call NTL functions, just provide these conversions.

The wrapper that is provided in the branch would be useful if it provided an alternative implementation of matrices (see also [comment:5] and [comment:7]). Matrices do accept an implementation keyword and one can imagine an implementation using NTL

```
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2, implementation='gap')
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_gap)
```


But these two purposes are mostly disjoint and I am inclined to think that you are interested in the first situation.

Yes thats a fair assesment, I suppose I thought it would be most helpful to lay a little groundwork for the latter purpose while doing the former. I would like to look into the alternative approach you suggest when I have some time as it does sound better, but that probably wont happen immediately.

Ok so over at #25366 I have tried to do as you suggest without adding any new classes, it was a fun exercise in permuting code until everything works... If you wouldn't mind checking it out and seeing how it compares to what you had in mind (the code at least, I'll fix all the style, the fact it says linbox still etc. once it seems the code is acceptable) that would be really helpful!

Instead of specifying the dependencies in the extension as

```
    Extension('sage.libs.ntl.ntl_mat_ZZ_p',
              sources = ["sage/libs/ntl/ntl_mat_ZZ_p.pyx"],
              libraries = ["ntl", "gmp", "m"],
              language='c++'),
```

it is prefered to put them in the `.pxd` file via distutils directive (to be put on top of the file)

```
# distutils: libraries = ntl gmp m
```

This way, any Cython file that includes the given pxd will be compiled with the appropriate linking.

The same applies to `language` and you could have a look at the various `pxd` files in `sage/libs`.
