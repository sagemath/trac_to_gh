`cygwin-minimal`, stage-ii-a and stage-ii-c still time out (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/641053384); more rebalancing should be done in the next release cycle. I stop for this ticket and 9.1. 

Uploading and downloading of our large sage-local artifacts is somewhat brittle, a game of chance: For example, in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/641209977 (`cygwin-standard`), stage-iii :

```

In the same run, for https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/641394549 (`cygwin-standard-python2`), the upload of stage-iii succeeded,
and stage-iv-a ... stage-iv-d downloaded it successfully. 
- stage-iv-a (`make ptest`, https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/641394549) terminates, with a number of doctest errors and timeouts:

  Looks like the giac interface is broken. 

- stage-iv-b builds a few optional packages; I have noted build failures in some separate tickets.

- stage-iv-c builds `cbc`, `sage_numerical_backends_coin` successfully.

- stage-iv-d (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/641394565) builds a long list of optional packages, times out;  I have noted build failures in some separate tickets.
