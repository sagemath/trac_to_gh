Does sage not support any sort of installation, either of the packages or the software itself with brew in macOS? If not, I suggest that we try and implement one, the same way it is trying to be achieved with pip

Trac tickets are usually more focused than this. It would be better to ask questions like this on the Google group sage-devel, and then open tickets based on the response. Many of Sage's packages can be installed via brew, and there are tickets that deal with this: either use trac's search feature or search the Google group sage-trac.

#29104 added information to Sage what homebrew packages are available (see files named `homebrew.txt` in the subdirectories of `build/pkgs/`).

If you want to help with homebrew packaging of Sage, that's great; the starting point would be Sage packages that have a `spkg-configure.m4` but no `homebrew.txt`.

Alright, I'll keep that in mind! Its just that I have seen tickets where there are such feature requests or where there is a demand for a particular tech, and there was plenty of collaboration there, so I thought it would be appropriate to open a ticket on the same.
Thanks for the heads-up!

It has been possible to install the SageMath macOS app
via a Homebrew "cask" for a while:

```bash
brew cask install sagemath
```

(not sure it has been updated for the new app by Marc Culler).

Some dependencies and optional package available via Homebrew "taps":

- GAP via the [GAP tap](https://github.com/gap-system/homebrew-gap)
- cddlib, cohomcalg, csdp, factory, fflas-ffpack,
  fourtitwo, frobby, gfan, givaro, lrs, macaulay2, mathic,
  mathicgb, memtailor, mpsolve, normaliz, openblas, topcom
  via the [Macaulay2 tap](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap),
  thanks to work by Mahrud Sayrafi,
  see [brew formulas](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/tree/main/Formula)
  (though different choices than Sage with respect to multithreading
  can [cause problems](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/issues/68))

There are probably others I'm not aware of.

Should we define a tox configuration to test building Sage
with GAP, cddlib, cohomcalg, csdp, factory, fflas-ffpack,
fourtitwo, frobby, gfan, givaro, lrs, macaulay2, mathic,
mathicgb, memtailor, mpsolve, normaliz, openblas, topcom
installed via the GAP and Macaulay2 Homebrew taps?
