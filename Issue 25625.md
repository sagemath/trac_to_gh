I'm currently having issues with this update for nix[1]. I will try to see if I can reproduce those issues with sage-the distribution.

With nix I get the following error building sagelib:


```

```


Which sounds more like an eclib error than just a changed interface. Might have something to do with eclibs changelog entry[2]

> Reorganised all include files so each may be included by itself.

Specifically the file in question (`types.h`) gained some preprocessor instructions that are probably relevant[3].
