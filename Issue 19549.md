```

Up to now I was able with sage7.0.beta1 to do without problems: 
make distclean
make
make giac
env SAGE_CHECK=yes make giacpy
on a 64bit debian system.

Can you precise if you got segfaults during the built of giacpy or during sage tests or with something at runtime?

My first priority was getting the list of "bad" packages. Now that is done, so I'll inform you about `giacpy`.
