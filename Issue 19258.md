This was a bad bug as it looped forever.

Overall it looks good to me, but you should add something like

```
Check that :trac:`19495` is fixed::
```

before the test so that anyone who wonders why this test is there, they can refer to this ticket.

You also need a blank line between the text and the tests, and to de-indent the text by one block:

```diff
-        Check that :trac:`19495` is fixed::
+    Check that :trac:`19495` is fixed::
+
         sage: dg = DiGraph(); dg.add_vertex(0); S = ClusterSeed(dg); S
```
