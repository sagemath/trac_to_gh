Seems ok with the canvas3d viewer (in sagenb):

```
sage: u,v = var('u,v')
sage: def cf(u,v): return sin(u+v/2)**2
sage: P = parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u)+cos(v), sin(v)),
....: (u,0,2*pi), (v,-pi,pi), color=(cf,colormaps.PiYG), plot_points=[60,60])
sage: P.show(viewer='canvas3d')
```

Needs to be tested in other kinds of notebooks.

Ok also in jupyter notebook. Remains to check in cloud (not that easy).
