# Issue 16761: Documentation conflict on is_graded()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16998

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2014-09-17 08:51:03

Documentation for `is_graded()` on `posets.py` says "Note that every graded poset is ranked, but the converse is not true.", whereas `hasse_diagram.py` says "A poset is *graded* if it admits a rank function."

Somebody knowing area should check this.

Actually it seems that `is_graded()` is not called at all. I guess it should be deprecated.

Some time ago (maybe 2 years), we (a few Sage-Combinat people) agreed on the following definitions:

A poset is *graded* if all maximal chains have the same length.

A poset is *ranked* if it admits a rank function.
A *rank function* f is a integer valued function on the vertices of a (finite) poset P such that
* f(p) = 0 if p is a minimal element in P, and
* f(q) = f(p)+1 if p \prec q is a cover relation in P.

That's good. It has been done on `posets.py`, but `hasse_diagram.py` still contains older(?) definition. Hence it needs correcting.

You are welcome to do so -- I'll be reviewing it then...

Ok, ok... Here it is.

Why did you decide to deprecate it rather than checking whether the Hasse diagram is graded?

What if somebody has really used `is_graded()` directly on hasse diagram, expecting it to say `True` if the hasse diagram is ranked? Of course nobody should do that, but instead use poset.

And on sage-devel list we discuss about moving code away from `hasse_diagram.py`.

Okay, sounds reasonable... could you leave one sentence in the documentation saying what this function returns?
