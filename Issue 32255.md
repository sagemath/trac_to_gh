# Issue 32255: sage-pip-install: Try installing without --no-deps first

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32492

We currently use `pip install` with the option `--no-deps` - which suppresses installation of runtime dependencies, as we rely on our own dependency management.

In order to make package upgrades (which might change dependencies) more robust, we change this to first attempt an install without `--no-deps`. Since we still use `--no-index`, it will not actually install from PyPI but fail with an error.
We then issue a warning (for developers) but fall back to the install with `--no-deps` (for robustness for users).

This doesn't quite work as intended. Weirdly, `pip` is ignoring the installed packages if it does not also have access to a package index (we use `--no-index` and also poison proxy variables, so it does not use PyPI).

This version works for me. It makes use of the previously built wheels that are kept in `$SAGE_VENV/var/lib/sage/wheels/`

This seems to work as advertised. Is there room at some point for a pickier build process that actually produces errors when this kind of thing comes up? (Something that could be used by buildbots or developers working new packages but not the default.)

A related question: how do we convince people to actually check for these warnings?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-09-17 18:35:01

I think there's room for escalation in a follow-up ticket, but I think it's safer to first bring it to wider testing by developers in the current form.

I've opened #32529 for this.

I tested this with `ipykernel`. It does indeed print a warning about a missing dependency, and it's not too hard to see from the log file that it's `debugpy`.
