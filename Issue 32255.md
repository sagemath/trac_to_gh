CC:  dimpase slabbe jhpalmieri

We currently use `pip install` with the option `--no-deps` - which suppresses installation of runtime dependencies, as we rely on our own dependency management.

In order to make package upgrades (which might change dependencies) more robust, we change this to first attempt an install without `--no-deps`. Since we still use `--no-index`, it will not actually install from PyPI but fail with an error.
We then issue a warning (for developers) but fall back to the install with `--no-deps` (for robustness for users).
