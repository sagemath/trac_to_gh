# Issue 33157: correct docs for running notebook on a specific port

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33394

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2022-02-21 08:56:50

What's given in `src/bin/sage-notebook` in this regard:

```
      sage -n default port=1234
      sage -n -- port=1234      # equivalent
      sage -n port=1234         # ERROR: invalid notebook name
```

is obsolete and wrong. Correct syntax is

```
      sage -n --port=1234
```

(the option name is `--port`, as expected)
