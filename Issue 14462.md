Reported by darij on http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7477 :

Feature suggestion, if not already implemented: a method to test if a given weight function is generic, i. e., has exactly one maximizing basis. Of course, this is easy thanks to the exchange graph, as one only needs to find a maximizing basis and then check that all its exchange neighbours have strictly smaller weight. This function is useful to some Hopf-algebraic constructions.

Thank you! May I ask a couple questions before I look deeper into the code?

- What is the difference between the two functions?

- What exactly is `X` used for? I assume the answer somehow depends on `X`. Is it just restricting the matroid to `X`?

Hi Darij,

We decided to avoid the suggestion given in the ticket, because it would require checking if up to $r(|E|$-r)$ additional sets were independent. (This could have been reduced, by only checking exchanges where the two elements had the same weight.) Our strategy was whenever we decided not to put an element $e$ into our basis $B$, we checked if would have been allowed to put it in if we had done so as soon as possible. In the case where we were not passed a weight function, this amounts to checking whether or not $\{e\}$ is independent. If we were passed a weight function, we check if the set smres is independent, where smres is all the things in res which have strictly more weight than $e$ together with $e$.

Essentially what I did was to copy the code for max_weight_independent() and modify it to see if it through out something that could have been kept in some application of the greedy algorithm. Other than declaring smres and changing the return statements to give booleans, I added the code following code to the case where I wanted to discard $e$. The only difference between is_max_weight_independent_generic() and is_max_weight_coindependent_generic() is that 'rank' was replaced with 'corank' in both places.

I agree that $X$ is just restricting the matroid to $X$.


                smres=res
                if weights is None:
                    if self._rank(set([e]))>0:
                        return False
                    else:
                        for f in res:
                            if weights(e)==weights(f):
                                smres.discard(f)
                smres.add(e)
                if self._rank(smres) > len(smres)-1:
                    return False


Cheers,
Tara

I've made some changes (NB: branch change!), particularly documenting one of the undocumented codepaths (namely, passing a dictionary for `weight`). However, it exposed a bug: The algorithm assumes `weight` to be a function.

My suggestion here would be to change the way dictionaries are handled. Rather than doing the `try/except`s, I'd check whether `weight` is a dictionary, and then define a function `weight_fun` to send each `e` to `weight[e]`. Otherwise, I'd just set `weight_fun = weight`. All other uses of `weight` in the code should then be replaced by `weight_fun`. Does this sound reasonable to you? (I haven't done any speed comparisons or other tests, so this might not actually be a good idea.)

Also, the algorithm looks nice and clean. I haven't proven it yet. Is it easy or should I know something it follows from?

The algorithm follows from the idea that whenever we apply the greedy algorithm, we get a maximal basis, and we can get each maximal basis by using the greedy algorithm. A maximal weighted basis `B` is unique if and only if for every `e\in E(M)-B`, we have `e` is in the closure of `{b\in B|w(b)>w(e)}`. In other words, `B` is unique, if when using the greedy algorithm, we never were able to choose an element of `E(M)-B`.

We don't need an array for `smres` in the weights is None case. I had originally put both cases in one for loop, until I realized that that was gross, and I didn't notice, when I changed it, that `smres` is now pointless in that case.

I mean that I'd expect

M.is_max_weight_coindependent_generic

to return the output of

M.dual().is_max_weight_independent_generic

I see it. The problem is that the user input variable "weights" is used down the line, as opposed to the object created in the try/except blocks. The list `wt` is not so useful, so I would probably define something that's guaranteed to be a function, like so:


```
if callable(weights):
    wts = weights
else:
    wts = lambda x: weights[x]
```

Then use wts instead of weights down the line.

For the record, to test a file, run (from the top `sage` directory):


```
./sage -t src/sage/matroids/matroid.pyx
```

The reason that `wt` is currently useful, is that it is used to sort the elements in decreasing order of weight. I'm not sure how to do that with only a function `wts`. I tried adding the function wts, but I ended up having it not compile. I'll look at it again tomorrow.

It won't compile when I have the line 

```
wts = lambda x: weights[x]
```


It will, however, compile when I have

```
if callable(weights):
                wts = weights
            else:
                return True
```


So for some reason, that I don't understand, we're not allowed to use lambda in this way. Functions in other places in the file use lambda inside a function call, and I don't see a difference in the syntax that we are using. I have also tried using
`def wts(x) : return weights[x]`.

> Oh! But then you should not be claiming that the two methods are doing the same thing. I changed the methods to achieve precisely this effect.

When I execute the following code, using the current version, I get `True` and then `False`. We should expect `True` in both cases, because `{3,4}` is the only maximum weighted basis of `M`. 

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import setprint 
M=matroids.Uniform(2,5) 
wt={0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 2}
M.is_max_weight_independent_generic(weights=wt)
M.dual().is_max_weight_coindependent_generic(weights=wt)
```


However, when I change those two lines back, I get `True` for both outputs. Furthermore, the code in `is_max_weight_coindependent_generic` looking the same as `is_max_weight_independent_generic`, excepting that `rank` is changed to `corank` makes intuitive sense to me.
