# Issue 27816: Adding length of a propositonal formula function in the Logic Module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28053

Original creator: @Medha210699

Original creation time: 2019-06-25 12:07:14

Keywords: logic, symbolics, propositional formula

This function first properly parenthesizes the given formula, then returns its length. 
Useful for proofs by induction on the length of a propositional formula.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: f.length()
3
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: g.length()
5
```


Note: This function will first parenthesize f to (a) and g to (a|b)

Changing priority from major to minor.

This patch defines the `__len__()` attribute of a Boolean formula to be the length of the formula. So `len(f)` is the length of the formula `f`. This is the number of operators plus the number of variables (counting multiplicity). Parentheses and spaces in the formula are ignored.

```
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: len(f)
1
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: len(g)
3
```

LGTM. I updated to description to match the implementation.

Thanks for the review and for correcting the description. However, I made a further correction to the description because `f.length()` does not work -- it needs to be `len(f)`.

Followup ticket: I opened #32148 to change `len(f)` to `f.length()`.
