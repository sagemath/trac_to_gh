Is this supposed to solve a particular problem, or is it general cleanup?

It fixes a problem when **sagemath-standard** is installed in a user-defined venv. In this case, before this ticket, the installed `sage` script would actually end up running `sage` from `SAGE_ROOT/venv`. 

We ran into this in #29865. The distribution **sagemath-objects**, as of #29865, also installs the `sage` script, and it had this behavior.

As this is merged with #29865, we can set the status when we do so for #29865. Is this okay?
