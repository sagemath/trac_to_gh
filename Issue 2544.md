From CRAIG:

```
So I think I'm ready for this to get merged. I've played around with
just about all of the code, and I looked through the last 2-3 files
that I hadn't looked at much since Tucson. I can't say that I read
every line of everything, of course, but I feel pretty comfortable
with the code overall. There are lots of things I want to start
working on, of course, but none of them are defects -- they're all
enhancements.

I went ahead and reformatted one or two things, and added some long
doctests to the top of homspace.py. I feel like adding a 387th patch
to the ticket is silly, since you'll probably also have one or two
small touch-ups, so you'll probably just re-roll the bundle. I'm
attaching the patch to this email.

As long as you feel like the code you didn't write seems reasonable
enough, I feel like this is ready to get merged.
```



I've posted a new abvar.hg patch, which is the one that should be applied.

I am seeing one doctest failure:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py        
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.0.alpha1/tmp/abvar.py", line 276:
    sage: cmp(J0(37), 5)
Expected:
    1
Got:
    -1
**********************************************************************
```


IIRC this compares just memory posititions, so it ought to be #random.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

DONE (william) 2: dual of A when A is maximal
DONE (william) images of abelian varieties and groups under morphisms. (2 hours)
DONE (william) intersections of finite groups
12:00am - 5am + airport:

plan for:
trim the paper
doctests
optimization
bug hunting

(craig) 2: norm equations (clean up patch) (1 hour)
5: minimal isogeny degree (3 hours)
intersection pairing.

(william) 3: dual isogeny when A,B both maximal
Todo on Tuesday, March 18

DONE (craig) 2: disc(End(A))
DONE (craig) 2: degeneracy maps
DONE (craig) 1: fix hecke operators

DONE (robert) 1: complementary isogeny (invert matrix and clear denom)
DONE (william) 2: quotient by abelian subvariety
DONE (william) 2: kernels of morphisms
DONE (william) 2: projection (only when 'maximal')

   <type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)
   ...
   <type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'Newform' object has no attribute '_compute'
DONE (william) This is completely wrong (the modabvar function on modular symbols assumes it's ambient!):
   sage: m = ModularSymbols(37)[1]
   sage: m.modular_abelian_variety()
   Jacobian of the modular curve associated to the congruence subgroup Gamma0(37)
DONE (william) Move functions out of abvar_modsym_factor into abvar and delete that file.

Todo on Monday, March 17

(craig) Compute End(A):
for simple AfAf (DONE)
in general.
disc of it.
