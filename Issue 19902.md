# Issue 19902: implement trigonometric symmetry simplifications

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20139

This will bring Sage to its knees:

```
assert sin(104*pi/105) == sin(pi/105)
```

because sin symmetry is not implemented and so the `__nonzero__` proof machinery is started which uses `QQbar` on algebraic numbers of high degree.

Sympy immediately verifies the equation because it does:

```
>>> sin(104*pi/105)
   ⎛ π ⎞
sin⎜───⎟
   ⎝105⎠
```

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This works in develop and is tested in `Function_sin` so can be closed.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
