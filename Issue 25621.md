Got confirmation from Odile that this patch works.

If possible I'd like to get this in 8.3 actually, but admittedly adding a patch to MPIR is a big rebuild, and it also affects only a few rare machines and has an easy workaround e.g. building MPIR with `--build=skylake` or some other earlier architecture.

I am much more split on this ticket (than the one that only affects Cygwin) as it could have more unintended side-effects. I am slightly on the side of waiting until 8.4 and having this go through beta cycles. If we get posts on sage-devel, you have at least seen the error and know the workaround. Plus this will only affect people building it from source on these rare machines, so the chances of someone being afflicted are marginal.
