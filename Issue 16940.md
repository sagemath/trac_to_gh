# Issue 16940: Latex function for sparse PolynomialRing is not sparsely implemented

Keywords: sparse polynomial

When pretty-printing a sparse polynomial, the latex function seems to run in linear time and memory on the size of the greatest exponent:



```
sage: F = GF(59)
sage: PF = PolynomialRing(F, 'x', sparse=True)
sage: x,=PF.gens()
sage: str(x^(10^12) + x)
x^1000000000000 + x
sage: latex(x^(10^12) + x)
<BOOM: MemoryError>
```
