These are gcc specific functions and shouldn't be used when compiling with clang. mpfr upstream hasn't checked clang-5 and over, stopping at clang-4.0.1.

Building clang/clang-runtime on Gentoo with "-default-compiler-rt" and "-compiler-rt -sanitize" fixes the problem as it now uses bits of gcc to provide those functions.
I think it is a bug somewhere in the clang install as those symbols (which are not requested by mpfr) shouldn't be generated when using clang's compiler-rt.

I think the problem is in how the compiler generates object code. There is nothing in the configuration of mpfr that indicates that soft-float math will be selected. The logs are not different either. So I think the behavior is linked to the use of `-mtune=` and `-march=`.

I see this while trying to build mpc on openbsd 6.4.

```
$ nm -D local/lib/libmpfr.so.6.1 | grep floatunditf
         U __floatunditf
```

and then mpc ./configure bails out without recongnising mpfr:

needless to say, mpfr's selftests fail with this error too.
The workaround (found [here](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2018/02/05/msg026238.html)) is to configure mpfr with `--disable-float128` flag, at least in the openbsd case.
