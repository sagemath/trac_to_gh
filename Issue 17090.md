# Issue 17090: Simplify computation of values of Dirichlet characters

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17327

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2014-11-12 18:59:36

Keywords: Dirichlet characters

The code for the method `DirichletCharacter.values()` is rather complicated.  It can be simplified using some features introduced in the dependencies of this ticket.

Unfortunately the current version gives a 50% slowdown (from 3 seconds to 4.5 seconds) for the following command:

```
sage: %timeit -n 1 -r 1 -c [[chi.values() for chi in DirichletGroup(n)]
....:                       for n in xrange(1, 100)]
```

This seems to be caused by an overdose of Python `map` and `lambda` constructions.
