Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in w over Rational Field
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'w', 1)
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in w over Rational Field
```


The best way would just be to call `PolynomialRing` in the constructor of `LaurentPolynomialRing`.

You should issue a warning saying this behavior has changed since, IIRC, the univariate polynomials have more functionality than multivariate.

I wonder what the `prepend_string` was originally used for...the comment about it is not so enlightening.

I should not. The previous version was wrongly writing `univariate` when it was `multivariate` with one variable...

```diff
-        if self._n == 1:
-            return "Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in %s over %s"%(self._R.variable_name(), self._R.base_ring())
-        else:
-            return "Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in %s over %s"%(", ".join(self._R.variable_names()), self._R.base_ring())

Yes, I agree. I should have checked the type before saying anything too.

Changes LGTM. This seems like a much needed cleanup.

That's also my fault that the description was unclear (I realized it while I was cleaning).

Thank for the review!
