Triggers one doctest failure. Damn.

Maybe one needs to implement `__ne__` ?

Since there were no tests for checking the inequalities, I think we are okay in assuming that was never really used (i.e., the total ordering was more artificial because of the `__cmp__` definition). While I am slightly worried someone is using it in an essential way, not enough to keep this from setting this to a positive review to continue the march to Python3.
