```diff

If I use `_basis_key`, I get this:

```
sage: d = lie_algebras.VirasoroAlgebra(QQ)
sage: d._basis_key(3)
3
sage: d._basis_key('c')
'c'
```

As a result, sorting doesn't work between them in Python 3. The `_sorting_key` attribute as I've defined it uses the *function* `_basis_key` in that file, which converts `c` to `+Infinity`.
