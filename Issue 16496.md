Actually Gentoo is still at 0.11 but if the patchbot is OK with it I have no problem with it. In our experience 0.10 is toxic but no other release is.

Since we are holding this I thought of something. Does the bot report doctests failures? I now remember that in sage-on-gentoo we had a small issue with a docutils upgrade:
https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/197
I had to add a couple of empty `__init__.py` to suppress some warnings appearing in doctests.

I ran this ticket + #16736 on the buildbot and there were no failures. I just didn't want to wait with beta8. Really, both tickets are ready and it just takes somebody to click on positive review.

I'll have to check if the files have been added since then, then. Or may be it was docutils 0.9. Looking at the other ticket.

Let me put that ticket back to needs_work: the added patch is unneeded in sphinx 1.2.2.

I also add a dep on #16396, which is precisely about going up to sphinx 1.2, hence making the patch obsolete.

Hopefully, I removed the sphinx patches and if successful it should be ready for review.

I am putting this as positive review any trouble will be caught by the bot when it is back on.

I tried to compile&ptestlong the u/vbraun/docutils_0_12 branch, and got a lot of failing doctests... I don't have much time to dig through but it looks like a problem with some kind of graph database... Is it an unrelated breakage?

Cannot say without seeing any output really.

I found the time to have a look : it looks like the failing tests have something to do with fetching graphs from some kind of SQLite database, as I have errors stating that there is no table named 'graph_data' everywhere ; so it looks like it's unrelated.

Good news : I started from master, merged the branch, recompiled everything, retested: all tests pass! So count me in for a positive review :-)
