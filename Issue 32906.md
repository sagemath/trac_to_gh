Is `qhull` installed properly? The only thing I can think of otherwise is that the compilation line includes path to the venv but not to `$SAGE_LOCAL/include` where the library should be found.

Replying to [comment:3 gh-kliem]:
> https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/gTNMEVbzb6M/m/aZCzjiXMAQAJ
From there:

```
configure:38313: checking for qhull
configure:38331: found /usr/bin/qhull
configure:38343: result: /usr/bin/qhull
configure:38359: checking is qhull's version good enough?
configure:38482: will use system package and not install SPKG qhull
```


Looks like `build/pkgs/qhull/spkg-configure.m4` is missing the "else" branch in AX_COMPARE_VERSION
