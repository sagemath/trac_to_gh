That this is about looking at the Documentation for PolyBoRi, I'd like to suggest the following for a start(based on the typeset documentation you linked to): 

General Observation: Please use `\langle` and `\rangle` to typeset < and > respectively. We might also want care for the plurality whenever relevant: like EXAMPLES. 

Specifics (I am commenting on the present state, and I would like some docstrings to be more descriptive): 

1. In the introduction, the {0,1} is being codified while it should be really typeset.
Example  
2. "that is the ideals `J` satisfying `I \subset J \subset P`" -- `P` is an undefined piece of notation; Also, we really want `\subseteq`. 
BooleConstant 
3. The function `has_constant_part()` has the word "for" repeated twice. And, the BooleConstant(1) bit needs to be codified. 
4. `is_constant` docstring sounds slightly awkard grammatically. 
5. `variables()`: "and" is a typo, I guess. 
BooleSet
6. `diff`: Use `\setminus` may be? 
7. `intersect`: "union" is really intersection. 
BooleanSetIterator 
8. `iterindex()`: indices is misspelt. 
BooleanMonomialIterator
9. codify StopIteration. 
10. `gen`: codify self 
BooleanMonomialVariableIterator
11. codify StopIteration
BooleanPolynomial 
12. `is_one`: codify self. 
23. `is_univariate`: codify self. 
34. `lex_lead()`: The term "lexicographical term ordering" sounds unfamiliar to me. Is "term" a part of the common usage? 
BooleanPolynomialRing
15. The class description relies on the INPUT section, perhaps not a good idea. The default value for `order` (lex) needs to be codified. 
26. `clone`: Indentation issue and also codify ring.clone... 

37. etc... [What I mean is, I'd get back with more comments, perhaps at a level not as superficial as the ones here. I know these are minor, but for a start...] 

There are some part where we could illustrate the necessary conditions in the Examples. I'll  go through more carefully to point out such cases.

I won't be getting around to fixing these in the next few days, so if you provide a patch I can look at it once I have a bit of free time.
