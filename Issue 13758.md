At #13849 Michael suggested to encourage Sage users more to look at the PolyBoRi (lowlevel) docs.

See http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/scratch/sage-5.5/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.html for typeset documentation.

Hm,  fine with that. But shouldn't you update your email adress?

Okay, I've dropped it completely.

That this is about looking at the Documentation for PolyBoRi, I'd like to suggest the following for a start(based on the typeset documentation you linked to): 

General Observation: Please use `\langle` and `\rangle` to typeset < and > respectively. We might also want care for the plurality whenever relevant: like EXAMPLES. 

Specifics (I am commenting on the present state, and I would like some docstrings to be more descriptive): 

1. In the introduction, the {0,1} is being codified while it should be really typeset.
Example  
2. "that is the ideals `J` satisfying `I \subset J \subset P`" -- `P` is an undefined piece of notation; Also, we really want `\subseteq`. 
BooleConstant 
3. The function `has_constant_part()` has the word "for" repeated twice. And, the BooleConstant(1) bit needs to be codified. 
4. `is_constant` docstring sounds slightly awkard grammatically. 
5. `variables()`: "and" is a typo, I guess. 
BooleSet
6. `diff`: Use `\setminus` may be? 
7. `intersect`: "union" is really intersection. 
BooleanSetIterator 
8. `iterindex()`: indices is misspelt. 
BooleanMonomialIterator
9. codify StopIteration. 
10. `gen`: codify self 
BooleanMonomialVariableIterator
11. codify StopIteration
BooleanPolynomial 
12. `is_one`: codify self. 
13. `is_univariate`: codify self. 
14. `lex_lead()`: The term "lexicographical term ordering" sounds unfamiliar to me. Is "term" a part of the common usage? 
BooleanPolynomialRing
15. The class description relies on the INPUT section, perhaps not a good idea. The default value for `order` (lex) needs to be codified. 
16. `clone`: Indentation issue and also codify ring.clone... 

17. etc... [What I mean is, I'd get back with more comments, perhaps at a level not as superficial as the ones here. I know these are minor, but for a start...] 

There are some part where we could illustrate the necessary conditions in the Examples. I'll  go through more carefully to point out such cases.

I won't be getting around to fixing these in the next few days, so if you provide a patch I can look at it once I have a bit of free time.
