I've made a new spkg for SageTeX. It now has a proper Mercurial repository layout, improved spkg-check, documentation about TeXShop, and more examples.

The spkg is available from http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.0.2.spkg.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5840

Okay, there's a yet newer version that I'd prefer get reviewed -- it has a "pause/unpause" feature that the author of TeXShop requested. The new spkg is: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.1.1.spkg. Changing this back to "needs review"...sorry Jason. :)

This looks great.  The one nitpicky detail that needs to be fixed (and then this is a positive review) is that the changelog inside of SPKG.txt does not mention the update to 2.1.1.  When that is fixed, change this to positive review.

Great work!

I updated SPKG.txt as requested. It feels slightly illicit to change my own ticket to "positive review", but Jason said so... :)

AFAIK it's supposed to be in the optional repository, but there were issues with spkgs there disappearing. In IRC, mabshoff has said that he wouldn't update or add new spkgs to the optional repo until someone figured out why spkgs were disappearing and fixed the problem.
