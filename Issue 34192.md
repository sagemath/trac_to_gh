It seems that gforge is gone at INRIA. On the other hand:

```
build/pkgs/ecm/SPKG.rst:-  ecm-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr (requires subscription)
build/pkgs/gf2x/SPKG.rst:Website: http://gf2x.gforge.inria.fr/
build/pkgs/mpc/SPKG.rst:   mpc-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr
build/pkgs/mpfi/SPKG.rst:The MPFI website is located at http://mpfi.gforge.inria.fr/
build/pkgs/mpfi/SPKG.rst:mpfi-users@lists.gforge.inria.fr
src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst:`Calcul mathematique avec Sage <http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr>`_.
src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py:         http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/
src/sage/interfaces/ecm.py:http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr for more about GMP-ECM.
src/sage/interfaces/ecm.py:        See http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr
src/sage/libs/libecm.pyx:See http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/ for more about GMP-ECM.
src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/README:freely available from http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/english.html
```


So it seems to me that these are either Paul `@`zimmerma projects (should one use links on https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/ instead?) and a sagebook - where is the online version now?

Thanks. What's the correct contact email for ECM? 

And what should be `...` in `mpc-discuss`@`…` and `mpfi-discuss`@`…`  ?

The emails show as "`@`..." only if not logged in to Trac.

Once logged in to Trac they appear in full.

All good, sorry for noise.
