CC:  kcrisman vdelecroix

This ticket rephrases the 'deprecation' section of the developer's manual to list the different types of deprecation and the tools that we have to deal with them.

It also adds superseded.py to the reference manual. Quite surprisingly, it was never included.

The name of the old function is missing in

```

```


The last example is not very good, it does not explain where to put `deprecation`. In the first line of the function ?
