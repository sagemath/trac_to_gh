This ticket rephrases the 'deprecation' section of the developer's manual to list the different types of deprecation and the tools that we have to deal with them.

It also adds superseded.py to the reference manual. Quite surprisingly, it was never included.

The name of the old function is missing in

```
my_old_function = deprecated_function_alias()
```


The last example is not very good, it does not explain where to put `deprecation`. In the first line of the function ?

Helloooooooooooo !

I rephrased it a bit... What do you think?

I also rebased the former commit on top of the latest beta.

Why is there

```

+Functions and classes

```

in `superseded.py` ?

Oh. Well, because otherwise the module's doc is immediately followed by the auto-generated documentation for the classes/functions contained in the object. I find it prettier like this, but if you object it can be removed.

oops, one second. Could you add the missing trac roles in superseded.py, please.

Then put back to pos rev
