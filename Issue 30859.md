Should I remove "sqrt_poly", which is no longer used anywhere ?

Isn't it recommended to have only one import per line ? Also, one import has parenthesis and not the other.

```diff
+from .torsion_subgroup import RationalTorsionSubgroup, QQbarTorsionSubgroup
+from .finite_subgroup import (FiniteSubgroup_lattice, FiniteSubgroup, TorsionPoint)
```


Shouldn't we split the long strings in raise statements over several lines ?
