CC:  @nathanncohen

A poset is chain if |V|-1=|E|, no vertex has out-degree >1 and no vertex has in-degree >1. Hence after #16984 code block


```
seen_0 = False
for d in self.out_degree():
    if d == 1:
        pass
    elif d == 0:
        if seen_0:
            return False
         seen_0 = True
     else:
         return False
```


can be shortened to be just


```
if any(d>1 for d in self.out_degree()):
    return False
```

Hellooooo !

I agree with everything in your patch but added a small commit at public/17002 to rewrite `is_chain` more compactly.

If you see no problem with that, please change this ticket's branch and set it to `positive_review`. Oh, and fill the "author" field too.

Thanks for this patch !

Nathann
