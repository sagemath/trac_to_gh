# Issue 27745: Lattes map for projective space fails to coerce base ring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27982

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2019-06-13 13:57:35

Keywords: SI2019

The following fails


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(GF(37),1)
E=EllipticCurve([1,1])
f=P.Lattes_map(E,2)
```


since E is defined over QQ and P is defined over GF(37). We should try to coerce to the base ring of projective space.
