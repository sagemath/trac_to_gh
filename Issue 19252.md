From the documentation,

> Maeder’s Owl (pretty but can’t find an internet reference):
> sage: u, v = var('u,v')sage: fx = v *cos(u) - 0.5* v2 * cos(2* u)sage: fy = -v *sin(u) - 0.5* v2 * sin(2* u)sage: fz = 4 *v1.5 * cos(3 *u / 2) / 3sage: parametric_plot3d([fx, fy, fz], (u, -2*pi, 2*pi), (v, 0, 1),plot_points = [90,90], frame=False, color="purple")Graphics3d Object
