Keywords: hold

It would be nice to have the output of

```
(x^3).diff(x, hold=True)
```

look like

```
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}x^3 $$
```

I agree this would be a nice addition; thanks for addressing this. Here are some comments.

In `src/sage/functions/other.py`:
- Something like `(x).diff(x*x, hold=True)` returns `diff(x, x^2)` instead of an error. Note also that `latex((x).diff(x*x, hold=True))` causes a segfault.
- The error message `wrong argument in diff` could be made more helpful; perhaps something like `all arguments to diff must be symbols or numerical values`. This should be tested as well.
- The LaTeX output should include parentheses around the expression (probably with `\left` and `\right`), otherwise something like `latex((x^3+y).diff(x,2,y,2, hold=True))` returns `{\frac{\partial^{4}}{{\partial x^2}{\partial y^2}} x^{3} + y}` which is incorrect.

In `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`:
- the `hold` parameter should be added to the docstring of `derivative`. I also noticed a typo in the first line of the docstring as well: `this expressions` -> `this expression`.
