CC:  fredrik.johansson vdelecroix mmezzarobba

this used to work in Sage 9.0:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
[+/- 4.01]
```

but does not work any more in Sage 9.3:

```
sage: RealBallField(2)(abs(exp(1)+I))
...
TypeError: unable to convert abs(e + I) to a RealBall
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32003

On CoCalc, this works in 9.1, but not in 9.2.  Since #18036 seems to have been merged in 9.3, I don't think it is the issue.

Likely #28517 (or its dependencies) then. If that's indeed the case, it used to work, yes, but for wrong reasons and thanks to code that produced catastrophically wrong results in other cases...

That would work, yes. And I agree that it would be nice to make `RBF(abs(...))` work too...
