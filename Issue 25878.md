# Issue 25878: docbuild: static files are copied instead of symlinked

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26115

At some point in the past, the `_static` directories in the generated HTML documentation were symlinks to a single master `_static` directory. Now it seems that the files are copied, leading to a huge explosion in size of the built documentation (more than 10GB).

See also #25111 and #25089. Do symlinks work on all of our supported platforms (Cygwin, in particular)?

See also [this post on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ETDQq4hOhuw/6hYAGwnjAQAJ), which gives another reason why the built documentation may take up a lot of room. (This is not to say that this ticket is invalid, just that there are at least two causes for the issue, both of which should be addressed.)
