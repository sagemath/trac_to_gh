Let's go to something avoid `six` in `permutation.py`:

```diff
         if k > len(self):
             return 0
-        incr_iterator = itertools.ifilter( lambda pos: all( pos[i] < pos[i+1]
-                                                            for i in range(k-1) ),
-                                           itertools.combinations(self, k) )
-        return sum(1 for _ in incr_iterator)
+        return sum(1 for pos in itertools.combinations(self, k)
+                   if all(pos[i] < pos[i+1] for i in range(k-1)))
```

and in `tutorial.py`:

```diff
-    sage: list(itertools.ifilter(lambda z: z.has_pattern([1,2]),
-    ....:                        Permutations(3)))
+    sage: [z for z in Permutations(3) if z.has_pattern([1,2])]
```

Also I think it might be good to either outright remove the `ifilter` (and `imap`) in `tutorial-comprehensions.rst` or put a note saying they are no longer supported in Python 3 and to avoid using them because Sage will eventually switch to Python 3.
