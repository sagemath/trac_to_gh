CC:  @embray @kiwifb @isuruf

these are very straightforward, basically just doing dependencies and version checks. 

`m4ri(e)` are quite stable, and it appears impossibe to distinguish the present version of `m4rie` from the older one. We just rely on the version of `m4ri`, it's dependence, which thankfully has pkg-config support.

with a macro to check dependencies that I wrote and used on these examples. Please review.

If it's only used within `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` it can probably use the `SPKG_NAME` macro.  But I think it's maybe a bit cleaner actually to keep it more independent.

Already working on this ticket I made an error involving the 1st parameter of `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`, as I copy-pasted it and didn't adjust is :-)

As we should eventually rewrite already done 20 or 30 spkg-configure.4 files using this macro, it's better to minimise the number of places one can make this sort of error...
