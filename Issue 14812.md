# Issue 14812: Some topological graph constructors

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15049

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2013-08-16 09:34:11

Some graphs which were missing in #9136. And I don't want to miss another occasion to say that I hate topological graphs. Theirs embeddings are the ugliest things on earth. Nobody should study topological graphs. It has to be bad for karma.

Anyway... And we are almost done with the graphs from #9136 (short of Tutte's fragment, which I doubt to be of any use independent from Tutte's graph which this patch implements). Another patch on Snarks will follow, today or tomorrow.

there are some problems in the web links in
* Horton
* Markstrom
* Sousellier

By the way, it seems that we do not have a is_hypohamiltonian method yet.

I just updated the branch by merging the patch with 5.12.beta1, though the link toward the Markstrom graph was okay on my side `O_o`

Oh, and ... yeah, we don't have a `is_hypohamiltonian` method yet, but as the only way I know to code it is to call `is_hamiltonian` n+1 times, I'm not that eager to write it unless I really need it for small instances `:-P`

for markstrom, the link is ok, but I have tried to see the doc in the notebook, and it was wrongly formatted

HMmmmmm... The.... Ahem.
Notebook....
Does not run anymore on my version of Sage `O_o`

there is the same kind of problem in the notebook with 

graphs.GrotzschGraph?

(namely the doc is not shown in a formatted way)

I suspect that the ö of Grötsch and of Markström may be involved.

Hmmmmm... I can't run the notebook on my git version of Sage, and my mercurial version of Sage works fine with the Grotsch graph.

This being said, if it comes from weird accents I guess that it counts as a notebook bug. Could you try writing a function in the notebook which uses a weird accent, and get its documentation next to see if it works ?

indeed, this happens also with the function

```
def pomme(x):
    """
    return the famous function pömme (`See there <http://www.pomme.com/>`_)
    
    EXAMPLES::
        
        sage: pomme(4)
        5
    """
    return x+1
```

and it works when replacing the ö by o. Should I open a ticket ?

there is a typo "Wikpedia" in Sousselier doc


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2013-08-27 15:15:16

Updated ! And yep, I think you should open a ticket but I have no idea where.. I don't even think that the notebook is actually part of Sage `O_o`

P.S. : I rewrote the last commit, I did not add a new one.
