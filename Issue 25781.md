Using a staging directory for package install can introduce race conditions. For example, when installing a Python package, the package is installed first and then the `egg-info` directory is installed. The latter is what `pkg_resources` uses to consider a package "installed".

If the `egg-info` directory is copied to `site-packages` before the actual Python package, then this can happen for example:

```
Installing alabaster-0.7.10
Installing package alabaster using pip2

    ImportError: No module named utils
```
What you see here is that `setuptools_scm` is used by `pkg_resources` even though the package `setuptools_scm` has not fully been installed.

I just had this happen trying to rebuild the Windows patchbot, which broke again, for some reason.

While I believe this is a more general problem in principle, it's happening specifically because installing `setuptools_scm` can alter the behavior of pip (in particular, it installs some `setuptools.file_finder` entrypoints).

Just as one possible idea, what about this?

Technically, what I called `$(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)`, could just be spelled "setuptools_scm", since there's already a direct dependency sequence of `setuptools -> pip -> setuptools_scm`.  But I like that having a `PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN` variable makes this relationship to other packages explicit, and can be modified in one place.

I don't understand the branch: it looks like `pip` need not be installed before all of the packages that (without the branch) have it as a dependency. In any case, with a Python 3 build, I get

```
No record that 'setuptools_scm' was ever installed; skipping uninstall
Installing setuptools_scm-1.15.6
your setuptools is too old (<12)

Perhaps `pip` should not have `$(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)` as a dependency.

I'm a professional software engineer and you are not my employer or my mentor--you don't have to tell me how to do my job.  Obviously I tested it, being that it's a fairly non-trivial change.

With respect, this is extremely condescending and unnecessary.  I'm a professional software engineer and you are not my employer or my mentor--you don't have to tell me how to do my job.  Obviously I tested it, being that it's a fairly non-trivial change.  I see what the problem is about pip and I'm not sure why I didn't hit on it, though I only would have if I were fully rebuilding from scratch (I believe, instead, I was doing some `./sage -f` calls that were designed to trigger the race condition).
