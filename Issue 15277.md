Hey! 

I am trying to learn git by trying to make a change to this patch.

So far I did 


```
git trac checkout 15514

which apparently created a new branch but I don't see it. Do you happen to know where can I access that branch so that I can actually push some changes here?

Excellent ! Well, it all looks good except your optimization for the objective function.

1) Really, you are solving a NP-Hard problem and you are saving on a list ? `:-P`

2) Actually, this code is slower than the previous one:


```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)
sage: %timeit sum(b[x] for x in range(1000))
10 loops, best of 3: 77.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit p.sum(b[x] for x in range(1000))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 ms per loop
```


This is because a "sum of LP variables" is a "linearfunction" object, and that adding to it another LP variable creates a second linearfunction object, which is mostly a copy of the previous one. Thus, `b[0]+b[1]+....+b[n]` creates `n` linearfunction objects and has a quadratic complexity.

That's why `p.sum` was created: as p.sum is dedicated to linearfunctions, it handles the, in the best way, without creating useless intermediate objects.

Nathann

P.S. : If you fix this in a third commit, you will haev commits which undo what the previous commits do. It is actually possibly, using git, to merge them all into one (called "squash" in git slang).

Two ways:

1) Look at "git rebase -i"

2) If you run "git reset HEAD~1", the last commit is "destroyed" and the changes it contains become "unstaged" chages. This, together with "git commit --amend" is another way to merge the commits.

I think its still fair to do such optimisations. They may come handy for say graphs of order ~100 and high degree. But if its not an actually improvement then ofc you're right and and my bad for not checking it!

Oooh, I was really wondering why we're using p.sum...

Hello !

> I think its still fair to do such optimisations. They may come handy for say graphs of order ~100 and high degree. But if its not an actually improvement then ofc you're right and and my bad for not checking it!

Ahahah. Well, in that case with the cost of adding all constraints to the LP this objective function may only be 1% of the total. And I am not talking of solving the actual thing ! `:-P`

> Oooh, I was really wondering why we're using p.sum...

Plus it is hard to advertise, as "sum" works. I even cheat a bit by using "sum" when I do a talk about that `^^;`

It seems to be the same as before. And there is this comment about Petersen's graph which is not followed by an example.
