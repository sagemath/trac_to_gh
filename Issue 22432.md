# Issue 22432: Three.js: add aspect_ratio multipliers to text3d

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The multipliers entered using the `aspect_ratio` keyword are currently not applied to the positions of `text3d` objects. This is a simple fix that can be tested with the graphics object


```
sum([text3d('%.1f'%n, (cos(n),sin(n),n), viewer='threejs') for n in [0,0.2,..,8]])
```


because the viewer has  automatic scaling in the z-direction that is not applied to the spiral of numbers.

Keep in mind that changes to the non-Python template require `make` even with `git trac try`
