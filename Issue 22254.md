The `lidia` optional package improves `latte_int` performances, but it needs to be installed when `latte_int` get compiled. Through it is not strictly necessary to compile `latte_int`, i propose to add it as a (build-time) dependency.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22491
