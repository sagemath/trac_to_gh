saclib tarfile downloads as saclib2.2.7... (no `-` after `saclib`).
It's best to change the line in `checksums.ini` to take account of this, I think.

IMHO it's rather some crap happening on the server of USNA, not on trac.

In fact, I tried modifying as I proposed:

```
--- a/build/pkgs/saclib/checksums.ini
+++ b/build/pkgs/saclib/checksums.ini
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-tarball=saclib-VERSION.tar.gz

 md5=e834693dd428caf1b15bd87b260f7825
 cksum=549883117
```

and it works, so there is no harm in using the URL without `-`.
If you can get it in then it's positive review. :-)
