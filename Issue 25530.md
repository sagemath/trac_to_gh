saclib tarfile downloads as saclib2.2.7... (no `-` after `saclib`).
It's best to change the line in `checksums.ini` to take account of this, I think.

There seems to be a symlink (or some kind of redirection) between `saclib2.2.7` and `saclib-2.2.7`, the following works:


```
wget â€‹https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/qepcad/INSTALL/saclib-2.2.7.tar.gz
```

to this link, my wget just says "Scheme missing" and bails out.

Me too ! Apparently, trac server does some funny encoding stuff that prevents copy/paste to work correctly (no idea why), but it works otherwise (for example you can try first to copy the line in a text file).

Otherwise this looks good to me.

IMHO it's rather some crap happening on the server of USNA, not on trac.

In fact, I tried modifying as I proposed:

```
--- a/build/pkgs/saclib/checksums.ini
+++ b/build/pkgs/saclib/checksums.ini
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-tarball=saclib-VERSION.tar.gz
+tarball=saclibVERSION.tar.gz
 sha1=c82597e094d771f7d63e77c3c104ba7ab56c16ea
 md5=e834693dd428caf1b15bd87b260f7825
 cksum=549883117
```

and it works, so there is no harm in using the URL without `-`.
If you can get it in then it's positive review. :-)
