# Issue 14966: error in LLL method with delta=1

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15203

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2013-09-17 13:50:10

Keywords: fpLLL

Acording to the documentation, the method LLL for integer matrices allows the parameter delta to take a value <=1, however, for delta=1 the method always fail. It did not failed with previous version of sage.


```
sage: m=random_matrix(ZZ,2,2)
sage: m.LLL(delta=1)
...
RuntimeError: fpLLL returned -1 != 0
```


Either the documentation should be updated or the code should be fixed.

It's a documentation error, delta must be < 1 for polynomial time.

delta must be < 1 for polynomial time. But not for finishing or not. Apparently, fplll does not allow delta=1, while NTL does. I have updated the documentation.
