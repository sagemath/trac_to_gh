This is not correct, I think.

```
+        .. SEEALSO:: :meth:`is_complemented()`
```

Ther should be no () at the end.

There are 7683 `:meth:` links in `src/sage`, and 242 of those has `()` at the end. So it is not an error, but of course an inconsistency.

Should we keep this one like it is, and later run a mass change to those parentheses?

I do not like mass changes at all. And I will probably not give a positive review if you keep the () here. :)

?? `git merge develop` to beta6 did not show anything.

The conflict will be with the next beta (with one of the tickets that Volker has merged since 8.0.b6). You need to wait.

OK. Back to _needs_work_.

Note to myself: if #22745 gets closed, add also crosslinks from it to other `is_*` -functions.
