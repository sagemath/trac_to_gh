# Issue 24341: Sage Interact Quickstart - dead link.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24578

Original creator: daholzfeind

CC:  dkrenn

Keywords: documentation, interact, url

The Sage Interact page ([http://interact.sagemath.org/](http://interact.sagemath.org/)) seems to be offline. I even can't find an alternative destination of this site, so i decided to remove it from the doc.

It does exist in the Wayback Machine ... but yes it is dead.   However, there is now [the UTMOST Sage Cell Repository](http://utmost-sage-cell.org) which fulfills a similar role, which could be linked to for now.

Done. But there are just two interact examples [http://utmost-sage-cell.org/interacts](http://utmost-sage-cell.org/interacts).

The patchbot should work fine now. There where some build-fails 'cause i had checked out my old work branch from master.
