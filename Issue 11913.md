Attached patch improves the documentation, but unfortunately it does not fix the docbuild warning.

Have you tried the raw mode? That fixed a similar problem mentioned in #9608.

Yep, without raw mode the backslash will wreak havoc...

True, but I'm still wondering why it works with Python 2.6 but not with Python 2.7.

Yeah, that is weird... [this](http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals) is where it shows up, but `\f` has been one of these for quite a while... because I always have to do `\\frac` when using labels in plots :)
