This is bad:

```
M = mandelbrot_interact
...adjust various attributes of M...
return M
```


The problem is that you are changing and returning a unique global object. Instead of having

```
@interact.widget
def mandelbrot_interact(...
```

it would be better to just define `mandelbrot_interact` as an ordinary function and call `interact.widget()` inside the `mandelbrot_plot` function. That way, you end up with non-unique widgets.

Can you explain the `<CSI-2K>` appearing in the doctests? I feel uncomfortable accepting that without knowing where it comes from.

I had 8.2rc4, and with `git trac checkout...` of this ticket I got 8.2beta8. So should I try to merge this to newest beta/rc version?
