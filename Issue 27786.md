Both patches affect only the build, so should be OK for distros.

Saying this ticket apply [PR#14582](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14582) is inaccurate because there is only one of the two commits of this PR in 
`python38.patch`. [4b957fd](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14582/commits/4b957fde34c869e40d010d2ec871d3d219e59ee2) is present but not [d94433](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14582/commits/d94433a2ca047d06fc3d7d01aee8bff5b2cf4820). Is it intended ?

Since [d94433](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/14582/commits/d94433a2ca047d06fc3d7d01aee8bff5b2cf4820) has nothing to do with python3.8 compatibility i set this ticket to positive review.
