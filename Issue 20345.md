Is there a reason for duplicating the functionality of `repr_lincomb` of `sage.misc.misc` with `repr_from_monomials`?

IIRC, it had to do with the spacing. The `repr_from_monomials` was more of a clone of how polynomial rings printed their elements (of which, they do not currently outsource to a separate function), which had more spacing than `repr_lincomb`.

From looking at the code, your fix looks good. However I want to try to see if I can do some slight cleanup so it is easier to read before I set it to a positive review. (I will need a few days to do so.)

I have pushed some changes in which I changed the logic to use `join` and (in my personal opinion) more understandable. If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review (with also adding your name to the authors field).
