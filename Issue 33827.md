I would expect this to fail because n^{i√3/2} cannot be represented in the growth group. It does fail if I restrict the growth group to `MonomialGrowthGroup.factory(RBF, 'n')`.

```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import *
....: BGG = cartesian_product([MonomialGrowthGroup.factory(RBF, 'n'), ExponentialGrowthGroup.factory(CBF, 'n')])
....: BAsy = AsymptoticRing(BGG, RBF)
sage: BAsy(n^(QQbar(-1)^(1/3)))
1.000000000000000*n^([0.500000000000000 +/- 1.95e-16])
```
