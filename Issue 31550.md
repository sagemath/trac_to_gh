CC:  @cheuberg @dkrenn

Alternative input arguments for the method `kRegularSequenceSpace.from_recurrence` should be implemented. Input `coeffs`, `M`, `m`, `initial_values` and `offset` should suffice.

Follow-up of #27940. See also meta ticket #21202.

I did a brief review of this ticket:

1. I had the strong feeling that it should be possible to also specify everything by keyword arguments. I find this in applications of the methods usually better readable as parameters are named. See the new commit.

3. We should consider using keyword arguements (now as we have them) for inputs like

```
RP(1, 0, {(0, 0): 1, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1}, {0: 0, 1: 1})
```

  to make this example better understandable by a reader (what is what).

. `M, m, coeffs, initial_values` in `__call__` could simplfy be called something like `recurrence` and be passed on by `.parameters(*recurrence)` as it is not needed to inspect the individual parameters independently. However, the current form makes it more explicit. (I have a slight preference for the former; opinions?)

4. I've only did some kind of a shallow review of `parse_direct_arguments`, in particular the doctests; seem fine so far from this point; code LGTM

Apart from these comments; changes LGTM.

Fine for me, the new commit LGTM.

You mean in the documentation of `from_recurrence`, right? (Because for the mentioned example `RP(...)` above you have already added the alternative with keyword arguments in your last commit.)

I see your point, but I don't really have an opinion on that.

I reviewed this ticket. Two new comments:

5. `parse_direct_arguments`, example: `var('n')` and `function('f')` can be removed.

6. `parse_direct_arguments`: I suggest to test for non-integer elements in `coeffs_keys` before checking for their size.

I may not understand comment 3 (as there is an example like that already for `RP`), but I suggest to formulate the example in `from_recurrence` with keyword arguments only.

Concerning the unnumbered comment: I prefer the current version such that checking for parameter names is done in one central location and not delegated to the subroutines.
