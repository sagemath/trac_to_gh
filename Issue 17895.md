I propose to implement the method "is_new", to decide if a Tamari interval
is  "new" (not in a proper facet of the associahedra) or not.

Changing keywords from "" to "Tamari, trees".

`possible_cut_shapes` sounds a bit vague. Maybe `single_edge_cut_shapes`? I am used (from the Hopf algebra side) to cuts intersecting several edges (or none at all).

LaTeX error: `1 leq i \ leq m+1`.

Can you add a section number to your `[ChapTamari08]_` reference?

Thank you. I've reviewed the binary tree method, which unfortunately is all I can review. But the rest should be really easy hopefully...
