I don't think tab spacing is a bug, see [absolute_generator ](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/number_fields/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.html#sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_absolute.absolute_generator) docstring, it basically tries to fit in line.

You're right; it's because of the use of `text-align: justify` for the paragraph in the docs' CSS.  Kind of ugly in this case, but not a bug as you say.  I thought maybe it was caused by some spurious tabs in the source code.
