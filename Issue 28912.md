# Issue 28912: Optional package sirocco broken on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29149

Keywords: sirocco cygwin

The package builds, but sagelib fails to link to it.  The problem seems to be a `__declspec(dllimport)` issue, so it's probably easily fixed.

This fixes the original problem described in this ticket.  It also depends on #29167 for sirocco to build properly on Cygwin without errors.

Is this fixed by #29284 (upgrade SPKG to 2.0.2)?
