# Issue 18421: Skipped doctests in graph_plot.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18658

As reported at [1], some doctests from graph_plot are skipped. This is because of a replacement that is being done in the '__doc__' variable of this file.

Hopefully, it also goes the other way around: if you introduce wrong doctests, `sage.doctest.sources` will (possibly) detect it.
