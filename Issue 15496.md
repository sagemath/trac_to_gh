# Issue 15496: substitution in symbolic function fails with latex_name

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2014-01-26 11:08:52

Keywords: substitute, function, solve, latex_name

The following substitution does not work:

```
sage: function('f', latex_name = 'blub')
f
sage: eq = solve((ln(f(x))==x).diff(x), f(x))[0]
sage: eq
f(x) == D[0](f)(x)
sage: eq.subs(f(x) == 42)
f(x) == D[0](f)(x)
```

Note that

```
sage: bool(eq.lhs() == f(x))
True
sage: id(eq.lhs()), id(f(x))
(119698064, 119698064)
```


When removing `latex_name`, everything works fine:

```
sage: function('f')
f
sage: eq = solve((ln(f(x))==x).diff(x), f(x))[0]
sage: eq.subs(f(x) == 42)
42 == D[0](f)(x)
```

Still there in 6.6.

Note that #6480 will change the r.h.s. too.
