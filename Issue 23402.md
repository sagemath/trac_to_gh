```
sage: pol = GF(3)['x']['y'].one()

sage: pol.roots()
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.ideal.Ideal_1poly_field'> to an integer

sage: pol.roots(multiplicities=False)
...
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
```

Bugs fixed. In order of appearance in the description:

1. Does not appear in version 8.9b7
2. Fixed by introducing special cases for constant and null polynomials
3. The call `p.roots(...)` at line 1755 of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py` had problematic parameters

Please doctest the error

```
+            if l < 0:
+                raise ArithmeticError("roots of 0 are not defined")
```
