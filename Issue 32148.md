CC:  @trevorkarn

Keywords: Bergman, Augmented-Bergman, Simplicial-Complex

The Bergman complex is the order complex of the lattice of flats of a matroid with the minimal and maximal element removed.

The augmented Bergman complex is a simplicial complex derived from a matroid, initially introduced by Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot and Wang.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32385

I also think it would be good to include a really small example that illustrates the naming of the elements ("L..." and "R...").

Related to this, in this code:

```
+                    for elt in chain:
+                        for c in cache:
+                            if elt == c:
+                                face.append(f'R{c}')
```

so do I understand correctly that `elt` and `c` are equal but do not necessarily have the same print representation?

I think the point here is that `c` is an element before taking the disjoint union, and so in order to add it to the disjoint union DM, we want to represent that same element by `Rc` so we go from the element in the cone of the Bergman complex to the element in the augmented Bergman complex.

I hope the rewritten code clarifies this distinction.
