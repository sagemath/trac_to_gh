# Issue 16660: use pip for some optional/experimental python packages

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Instead of using the home made `sage-spkg` for unpatched Python packages it would be simpler/better to use pip (no worries about upgrades, etc). As examples, we have the following optional packages that can be used to test the switch
 - beautiful soup 
 - pyopenssl
 - pyqtx
 - pyzmq

I guess the simplest would be to make `pip` a standard package and create the command `sage -pip`.

Then for each of the listed package in the description, the `sage-spkg` script will just raises an error explaining the new procedure

```
The packages XYZ is now handled with pip (a package manager for Python).
To install it, just do
   $ sage -pip install XYZ [extra_options]
For further informations, refer to the documentation at
http://pip.readthedocs.org
```


Another option is to redirect `sage-spkg` input to `pip` if everything else failed but I do not like that so much.

#20218 offers a middle ground--it keeps `spkg-install` (in particular since at least some packages need a little more work before it can run `pip`).  But for most Python packages the sole function of `spkg-install` is to cd into its source and run `pip`.

I think having a proper `spkg-install` script for each package, even if it's trivial, is ultimately simpler and less confusing than having different build/install paths for different kinds of packages that meet a very specific set up conditions.  Better that all packages have an `spkg-install` documenting "this is how you install this package", and not require a priori knowledge that some arbitrary package happens to be a Python module distribution.

We have `pip` packages now.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
