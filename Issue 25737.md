This one silly fix took this module from 67 doctests failing to 100% passing on my python3 branch.

Patchbot shows a lot of elliptic function methods and other things that may be related failing.

That's quite a coincidence but I don't think it's related.  I believe those failures are due to a bug in uninstalling/reinstalling the sympow package.  I encountered the same recently myself.  I will run the tests locally just to be sure though.

Yeah, I was able to confirm that these tests pass locally, but breaking the `sympow` executable breaks them.  This is due to #25856, but not this ticket.

I also just ran the tests on my machine with no problems.
