Looks good to me. Maybe you could add two seealso between the two Blanusa snarks (so that one can find the other if one reads the doc of one) ?

Otherwise, you can set a positive review.

Hmmmmmmmmm `O_o`

I just rebased this ticket on beta0 and added a patch for your comments (plus two broken links I found). All the other patches you see are just what got merged in beta0 `O_o`

Needs review again `^^;`

If you just want to see what is contained in this branch (whose last commit is 0a4240c) without seeing what is included in beta0 (whose commit is 3735dfd) you can do 

```
git log 0a4240c ^3735dfd --oneline
```


If you also want to ignore what was contained in the dependency #15049 (whose last commit was 3025cca) you can do 

```
~/sage$ git log 0a4240c ^3735dfd ^3025cca --oneline
0a4240c trac #15054: reviewer's comments
b622f3d trac #15054: rebase on 6.1.beta0
c75aeda Fixing a stupid mistake
63d241d Blanusa Snarks graph constructors
72fe3a8 Watkins Snark graph constructor
dc00a5f Szekeres Snark Graph constructor
f688702 Tietze Graph constructor
```


Hoping that it helps `^^;`
