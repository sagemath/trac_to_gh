Looks good to me. Maybe you could add two seealso between the two Blanusa snarks (so that one can find the other if one reads the doc of one) ?

Otherwise, you can set a positive review.

If you just want to see what is contained in this branch (whose last commit is 0a4240c) without seeing what is included in beta0 (whose commit is 3735dfd) you can do 

```
git log 0a4240c ^3735dfd --oneline
```


If you also want to ignore what was contained in the dependency #15049 (whose last commit was 3025cca) you can do 

```
~/sage$ git log 0a4240c ^3735dfd ^3025cca --oneline
0a4240c trac #15054: reviewer's comments
b622f3d trac #15054: rebase on 6.1.beta0

Hoping that it helps `^^;`
