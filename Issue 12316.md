# Issue 12316: Make sage-make_devel_packages not fail if there is nothing to commit

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12488

Assignee: leif

When doing `hg commit` but there is nothing to commit, the exit status is 1.  Since this isn't a failure, we should allow this in `sage-make_devel_packages`.
