Reported by Mike Witt on sage-support:


```
sage: latex(t)
\left(2 I\right) \, \pi n x + \left(-2 I\right) \, \pi n
```


`+ (-2 I )` looks really ugly.

sage: latex(t)
2 i \, \pi n x - 2 i \, \pi n
```


attachment:trac_9394-leading_minus.patch contains the doctest changes. The fixes in the printing of rational functions (for #9834) are also included in this patch.

The pynac package includes patches for #9834, #9878, #9879, #9881, #9900 as well as this ticket. See the ticket description of #9901 for the list (and order) of patches associated to the new version.
