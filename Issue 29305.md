# Issue 29305: spkg-configure.m4 for pynac

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29542

Original creator: @thierry-FreeBSD

Keywords: spkg-configure pynac

This ticket adds an spkg-configure.m4 for pynac, in order to use it from a system package if possible (see #27330).

Remark: it works as-is when pynac has been built without giac, i.e. if --without-giac has been set (when giac is installed, pynac finds and uses it by default). And if pynac has been built against giac, src/module_list.py must be patched.

See also #30534	- Repackage pynac as a pip-installable package (then no spkg-configure would be needed)

This is not ready. The `spkg-configure.m4` would need to check that `pynac` works with the configured `PYTHON_FOR_VENV`; and the system `pynac` cannot be used at all if we build our own `python3`.

I'd rather go in the direction of #30534
