The current openssl package doesn't build on OS X Lion. Here is an spkg which does; it also updates openssl from 1.0.1a to 1.0.1c:

The previous version of openssl had no Mercurial repository (!), so I created one, then made the changes relevant to this ticket.  I'm attaching the diff showing those changes. This also adds an spkg-check script.

OS X Lion: builds and passes tests
sage.math: builds but fails tests
cleo: builds but fails tests
taurus: builds but fails tests
silius: builds but fails tests

mark, hawk: the build fails, but it did with the old version also.

I don't have the time to track down the test failures right now. I'm guessing that they would have happened with the old spkg as well, but I haven't actually tried that. For OS X, I don't have access to any non-Lion machines.

etc., probably ok, but [the developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#section-spkg-install) has

not that I want to hold up #11080 at all.

Also, I really didn't understand the very long discussion about licensing at #11080 at all - but I assume that this will be an *optional* spkg, only needed if one's computer doesn't have openssl dev "headers" and wants to build from scratch and/or use the OpenID logins?

OpenSSL would be *required* both to build and run Sage.  The spkg is optional only in the sense that you don't need it if the operating system provides it.  Since OpenSSL is truly *required* for Sage, it's dubious that Sage is obeying the GPL, but IANAL.

Right, I just meant that under ordinary circumstances this spkg would not be required.

This actually takes a while to build, I'm a little surprised... did it overwrite my existing openssl headers, by the way?  Hopefully that wouldn't be a problem :(

Built ok on OS X 10.6 Intel and OS X 10.4 PPC.  I did not run self-tests, pursuant to John's comment above and since it's an optional spkg.

So I guess it's ok that `-fno-common:-arch ppc` and friends are still in there, since it worked?  I notice that in the `"darwin64-x86_64-cc"` line, all references to `arch` were removed...

What is the status here?  John tested the Solaris patch from Jeroen.  If Jeroen tested on Lion, then this should be mostly okay, possibly except my comment about `arch` and slight changing of the spkg-install (probably pointless).

Full disclosure; the PPC one still was using the Apple gcc, because I hadn't had access to it for a while (no keyboard) and it's still building the latest beta.  So maybe that's a false alarm, though I have no reason to suspect not - I can try again whenever that finishes if it's really important.  But the 10.6 was with Sage 5.1.beta3, so that should have the Sage-provided gcc in use.

So no worries about the other `arch` locations?  Jeroen, have you been able to test on a Lion machine?  I can't.
