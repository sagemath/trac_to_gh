In 6.3.beta5 we have

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[ 4, -2,  4,  2],
....:                 [-2, 10, -2, -7],
....:                 [ 4, -2,  8,  4],
....:                 [ 2, -7,  4,  7]])
sage: A.indefinite_factorization()
(
[   1    0    0    0]              
[-1/2    1    0    0]              
[   1    0    1    0]              
[ 1/2 -2/3  1/2    1], (4, 9, 4, 1)
)
sage: A
[ 4 -2  4  2]
[-2 10 -2 -7]
[ 4 -2  8  4]
[ 2 -7  4  7]

sage: B = matrix(QQ, [[ 4, -2,  4,  2],
....:                 [-2, 10, -2, -7],
....:                 [ 4, -2,  8,  4],
....:                 [ 2, -7,  4,  7]])
sage: B.set_immutable()
sage: B.indefinite_factorization()
(
[   1    0    0    0]              
[-1/2    1    0    0]              
[   1    0    1    0]              
[ 1/2 -2/3  1/2    1], (4, 9, 4, 1)
)
sage: B
[   1    0    0    0]
[-1/2    1    0    0]
[   1    0    1    0]
[ 1/2 -2/3  1/2    1]
```


Actually the problem stems from the output of `change_ring()`:

```
sage: A.change_ring(QQ) is A
False
sage: B.change_ring(QQ) is B
True
```
