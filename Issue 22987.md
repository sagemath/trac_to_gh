# Issue 22987: wrong symbolic comparison of log

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23224

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2017-06-12 15:56:12

CC:  rws mforets

Namely

```
sage: bool(log(8)- 3*log(2))
True
sage: bool(log(8)==3*log(2))
False
```

Can we hope to enhance this somehow ?

Factorization in `GiNaC::log_eval`, why not.
