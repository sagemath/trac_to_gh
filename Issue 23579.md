Implement the action of left multiplication on scheme points by matrices. In other words, make the following type of example work


```
sage: P = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
sage: Q = P(1)
sage: m = matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [1,1,0,1])
sage: m*Q
```

Previous status change was because 23813 had a very small error message change. Should be otherwise the same.
