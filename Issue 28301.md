As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/48058/stack-overflow-in-boolean-test/):


```
sage: x, y = var('x, y')
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: assume(y>0)
sage: bool(y*(x-y)==0)
```


leads to (on my computer 8.9.rc1):


```
;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also kwown as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;
```


or (as reported, on 8.8)


```
RuntimeError: ECL says: C-STACK overflow at size 1048576. Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```


Exchanging `x` and `y` works correctly:


```
sage: x, y = var('x, y')
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: assume(y>0)
sage: bool(x*(y-x)==0)
False
```

In maxima:

replicates the crash. That's sufficient to report upstream. Perhaps they can fix it.

The original problem seems fixed by #30063 :

```
sage: x, y = var('x, y') 
....: assume(x>0) 
....: assume(y>0) 
....: bool(y*(x-y)==0)                                                          
False

Testing it properly might be a bit tricky, tough...

This is why i am waiting #30063 to be merged to add a doctest.

This is a Maxima bug, it was reported and fixed upstream. I do not have the skill to inspect further within Maxima source code, so this doctest is the best i can provide, and it corresponds to the reported bug. If someone could provide more doctests to surround the original problem more securely, i am all for it.
