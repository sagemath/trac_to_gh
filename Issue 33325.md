```
H=Graph({0:[1,2,3], 4:[0,2], 6:[1,2,3,4,5]})
H.weighted(True)
H.weighted_adjacency_matrix()
```

should give something useful, but instead is an inexplicable error message

```
TypeError: NoneType takes no arguments
```

This happens whether or not this graph is said to be weighted.  There should be an error catch for a useful message.

It's not the only undesirable behavior of methods using `weighted`.

```

This said, I'm not sure which is the best solution here. Should we first check edge weights (with/without using a base ring) ? force to pass a weight function ? Something else ?

Replying to [comment:7 David Coudert]:
> `'a'` can be a label, but not a weight. So far we always consider weights as numbers that you can use for instance to compute a shortest path or a minimum weight spanning tree. 

sure, but we're talking about the adjacency matrix with the edge labels put at their respective places. These labels may be e.g. polynomials, or complex numbers - objects on which there is no natural order to speak about. Why would one want to forbid such matrices? E.g. in linear algebra one naturally may represent sparse matrices as graphs.
