# Issue 33325: Bad error message for weighted adjacency matrix

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33562

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2022-03-25 14:27:16


```
H=Graph({0:[1,2,3], 4:[0,2], 6:[1,2,3,4,5]})
H.weighted(True)
H.weighted_adjacency_matrix()
```

should give something useful, but instead is an inexplicable error message

```
TypeError: NoneType takes no arguments
```

This happens whether or not this graph is said to be weighted.  There should be an error catch for a useful message.

It's not the only undesirable behavior of methods using `weighted`.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 1)])
sage: G.weighted_adjacency_matrix()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: NoneType takes no arguments
sage: G.weighted_adjacency_matrix(base_ring=ZZ)
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: G = Graph([(0, 1, '12')])
sage: G.weighted_adjacency_matrix(base_ring=ZZ)
[ 0 12]
[12  0]
```

This said, I'm not sure which is the best solution here. Should we first check edge weights (with/without using a base ring) ? force to pass a weight function ? Something else ?

I added a check of edge weights. Let me know if this is what you expect.

Why can't `'a'` be a weight?

IMHO whatever values we have on edges may be weights.

`'a'` can be a label, but not a weight. So far we always consider weights as numbers that you can use for instance to compute a shortest path or a minimum weight spanning tree.

Replying to [comment:7 David Coudert]:
> `'a'` can be a label, but not a weight. So far we always consider weights as numbers that you can use for instance to compute a shortest path or a minimum weight spanning tree. 

sure, but we're talking about the adjacency matrix with the edge labels put at their respective places. These labels may be e.g. polynomials, or complex numbers - objects on which there is no natural order to speak about. Why would one want to forbid such matrices? E.g. in linear algebra one naturally may represent sparse matrices as graphs.

Here is an alternative solution that catches `None` and proposes to set a `default_weight`. This should answer the issue raised in this ticket and let users manipulate different types of labels.
Note however that `'a'` is not accepted by the matrix constructor.

OK, rebased over the latest beta. Looks good.

By the way, edge weights are allowed to be ring elements, e.g. `SR`, or polynomial rings. So it's OK as far as I am concerned - but of course doing any kind of e.g. shortest path computation (anything that assumes that weights are comparable with `<`) on such graphs makes little sense.
