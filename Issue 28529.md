Keywords: cones, incidence matrix

This ticket implements the incidence matrix for cones. This method is used to simplify getting the face lattice.

Columns correspond to facets, rows to rays. So there is no extra row for the vertex.

As a follow up, one can then obtain the combinatorial polyhedron of a cone.
