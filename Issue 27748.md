# Issue 27748: Dynatomic polynomial fails to coerce base ring

Keywords: SI2019

The following fails:

R.<c> = QQ[]
Pc.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(R, 1)
f = DynamicalSystem([xˆ2 + c*yˆ2, yˆ2], domain=Pc)
new_fixed=2
m = matrix(FractionField(f.base_ring()), 2, 2,[(new_fixed - 1)/new_fixed, 0, -1/new_fixed, 1])
F=f.conjugate(m)
F.dehomogenize(1).dynatomic_polynomial(2)

You'll need documentation on that function before it can be marked positive, but we can test functionality.

The documentation is there now. It just needs review.
