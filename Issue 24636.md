* Added some extra tests for new method, namely:
    - consistency of decomposition - recomposition
    - consistency of grafting_tree - from_grafting_tree
    - tests on statistics for the rise-contact involution
* Added some refs for grafting_tree and decomposition - recomposition
* Changed [PCh2013] to [ChP2015] so that it links to the complete paper and not the FPSAC extended abstract

I am happy with the ticket. I checked all the methods which refereed to my recent paper and they do what they're supposed to. I didn't check the "modern" methods referring to Baptist's paper but I trust you on that.

I also checked the documentation and tested the file.

As we are both set as authors, do we need another reviewer? Or can we give it a "positive review" if we're both happy?

Anyway, I let you have a look at my small changes.

Merci. Pas besoin d'autre rapporteurs. On attend juste le feu vert du patchbot.
