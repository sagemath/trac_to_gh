Keywords: copy, tensorfields, sections

Currently, we have


```python
        resu = self._new_instance()
        for dom, rst in self._restrictions.items():
            resu._restrictions[dom] = rst.copy()
        resu.set_name(name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
        resu._is_zero = self._is_zero
        return resu
```


where `resu.set_name(name=name, latex_name=latex_name)` loops over all restrictions again. This can be reduced to just one loop by passing `name` and `latex_name` to the restriction's copy-method.
