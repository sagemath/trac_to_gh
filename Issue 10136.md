We should have a clean interface to various transformations one might want to perform on symbolic expressions. For example,

```
sage: rewrite(exp(x), "exp2sincos")
-I*sin(I*x) + cos(I*x)
sage: rewrite(exp(-I*x), "exp2sincos")
-I*sin(x) + cos(x)
sage: rewrite(exp(a+I*b), "exp2trig")
(sinh(a) + cosh(a))*(I*sin(b) + cos(b))
sage: rewrite((e^x)^2-e^(-2*x)+e^(-4*x)+(e^x)^4, 'exp2sinhcosh')
2*sinh(2*x) + 2*cosh(4*x)
```

The design of this interface is being fleshed out in

I think the first tangible step would be to provide a `x.rewrite()` with the same interface as SymPy's, calling SymPy. Later this can be adapted. However, I think the SymPy way is quite a good start.
