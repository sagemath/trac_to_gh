# Issue 19687: Automaton: Add Reversal

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19924

Original creator: mcognetta

Original creation time: 2016-01-21 00:43:09

Keywords: Finite State Machines, Closure Properties, Automata

Deterministic Finite Automata are closed under reversal. The FiniteStateMachine class has several closure operations implemented that the Automaton class inherits, but not reversal. This patch would add the reversal closure operation to the Automaton class.
