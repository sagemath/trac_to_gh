There will be a libtool release soon: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2014-10/msg00000.html

Regardless, I think we should work around this by setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 10.9. By the time 10.11 rolls out we'll be in better shape to push this out to upstream projects.

For the record, all testsuites pass except the following

```
SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES=!python,!zeromq,!pari,!gsl,!flint,!m4rie,!iml
```

The iml one is taken care of in #16706, I believe.

Looks good to me, builds on OS X 10.10 Yosemite.

On OS X *10.9*, flint and m4rie still fail their test suites with this ticket. (I assume that Python does also, but I never check that one. Same with iml.) pari passes. zeromq passes with the change from #17212 applied.

Of course this ticket shouldn't change anything with OS X 10.9. The failures for flint and m4rie probably come from #17169.
