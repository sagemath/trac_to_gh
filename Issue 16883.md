In sage-5.12, the following takes a bit over a second:

```
sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^8 - 20*x^6 + 104*x^4 - 40*x^2 + 1156)
sage: %time K.galois_group().ramification_breaks(K.primes_above(2)[0])
CPU times: user 0.57 s, sys: 0.18 s, total: 0.75 s
Wall time: 1.32 s
{1, 3, 5}
```


In sage-6.3, it takes about 50s:

```
sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^8 - 20*x^6 + 104*x^4 - 40*x^2 + 1156)
sage: %time K.galois_group().ramification_breaks(K.primes_above(2)[0])
CPU times: user 50.1 s, sys: 440 ms, total: 50.5 s
Wall time: 51 s
{1, 3, 5}
```

In Sage-9.0.beta6:

```
sage: %time K.galois_group().ramification_breaks(K.primes_above(2)[0])
CPU times: user 423 ms, sys: 8.12 ms, total: 431 ms
Wall time: 430 ms
{1, 3, 5}
```

Agreed. This seems to be fast in 9.0.b9.
