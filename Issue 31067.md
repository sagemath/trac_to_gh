Editor temp/auto-save files can cause errors when building sagelib:

```
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "/Users/yzh/sagecopies/sage/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/setup.py", line 76, in <module> python_packages, python_modules, cython_modules = find_python_sources( 
File "/Users/yzh/sagecopies/sage/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/sage_setup/find.py", line 167, in find_python_sources if is_in_distributions(filename): 
File "/Users/yzh/sagecopies/sage/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/sage_setup/find.py", line 158, in is_in_distributions distribution = read_distribution(os.path.join(dirpath, filename)) 
File "/Users/yzh/sagecopies/sage/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/sage_setup/find.py", line 45, in read_distribution with open_source_file(src_file, error_handling='ignore') as fh: 
File "/Users/yzh/sagecopies/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/Cython/Utils.py", line 254, in open_source_file raise FileNotFoundError(source_filename) FileNotFoundError: sage/numerical/backends/.#interactivelp_backend.pyx 
************************************************************************ 
Error building the Sage library
```


We modify `sage_setup.find` so that typical patterns of auto-save files are ignored.
