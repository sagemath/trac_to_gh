This is from GiNaC:

```
sage: w0=SR.wild(0); w1=SR.wild(1); w2=SR.wild(2)
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0+w1))
sage: (sqrt(c+x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0+w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
ssage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w0 * sqrt(w0*w1))  # no output: fail
sage: (sqrt(c*x)*x).match(w1 * sqrt(w0*w1))
{$0: c, $1: x}
```


Matching practically works if wildcards are not repeated. This means it's unusable for serious work.

It should be noted that GiNaC's match() also does not differentiate between regular and sequence variables, they behave as regular in nonassociative functions, but as sequence in sums and products. This means that `(a+b).match(a+b+w0)` will match with `w0:0`. This can no longer be changed as it's established by now. It however complicates real commutative matching (if done right) by a great deal.

In contrast Mathematica differentiates between `f[a + b + u_] := u` where `f` does not match `a+b`, and `f[a + b + u___] := u` with `f[a + b] = Sequence[]`.
