# Issue 32162: Add sqlite3 to sqlite/distros/cygwin.txt

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32399

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2021-08-19 12:08:57

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: sqlite, distros

The file `sqlite/distros/cygwin.txt`
has `libsqlite3-devel` but not `sqlite3`.

Without `sqlite3`, three doctests fail
in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py`:


```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/tests/cmdline.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 586, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    out.startswith("3.")
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 588, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    err
Expected:
    ''
Got:
    '/home/sage/sage/src/bin/sage: line 667: exec: sqlite3: not found\n'
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 590, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    ret
Expected:
    0
Got:
    127
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   3 of 221 in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
    [220 tests, 3 failures, ... s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Note `sqlite` is a standard spkg.

does the parser understand such multiline input here?


---

Comment by slelievre created at 2021-08-23 09:21:38

Many `build/pkgs/*/distros/*.txt` files
are multiline, so I'm pretty sure yes.

OK, fine.
