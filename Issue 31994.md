# Issue 31994: Upgrade pcre to pcre2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32231

Our "pcre" package exists only as a dependency of R as far as I can tell, and has been replaced by pcre2 (https://www.pcre.org/) both upstream and within R. We should use the newer library instead.
