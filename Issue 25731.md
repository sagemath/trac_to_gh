# Issue 25731: Mark random hyperelliptic_finit_field failure as known

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25968

Keywords: random_fail

Since a fix for #25790 hasn't emerged in time for the release, we should at least mark the failure as known.

Should any more tests be marked as known bugs?

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This change is intended for the 8.3 release. If it is not applied, users might

- expect this to work
- experience test failures
- spend time debugging this
- report this repeatedly

Since it only disables one doctest, it cannot cause any new failures.

Well that train has departed. If you want to avoid this in the future make sure tickts are reviewed well in advance of a release.

Oh I didn't see the release email. But what's the point of the Blocker label if it doesn't actually block anything? I thought that was exactly to make sure somebody reviews this before the release. Maybe that somebody would decide that its not important enough, but we should at the very least review it and remove the blocker label before a release.

At the very least the blocker label gets it to the attention of the release manager, who will make an executive decision if neccessary. And in this particular case I thought its better to forge ahead than wait longer.

I don't want to start another process discussion here, but for the record:

I think it would be a better policy in these cases to first notify those involved in the ticket ("I don't think this should block the release"). Then give it at least a day for discussion. If agreement can't be reached, bring it to a vote on sage-devel.

I'm happy to set positive_review on this if it will help on some platform, but could you mention on what platform(s) you see this issue?  I've been trying to reproduce it on my ubuntu machine and I can't see any test failures.

It used to reliably happen on my NixOS (linux) laptop. At the same time it wouldn't happen on my desktop with the exact same dependencies and in the same sandbox.

I just tried reproducing it with 8.4.beta6 on my laptop and I cannot. So maybe it is fixed, maybe the conditions triggering it have changed a bit.

I'm proposing to close it as invalid/wontfix then.

That's alright with me, since its impossible to determine for now if the bug is still there or not

No harm in re-opening tickets if/when it comes up again.
