Oh I didn't see the release email. But what's the point of the Blocker label if it doesn't actually block anything? I thought that was exactly to make sure somebody reviews this before the release. Maybe that somebody would decide that its not important enough, but we should at the very least review it and remove the blocker label before a release.
