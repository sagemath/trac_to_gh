Oh I didn't see the release email. But what's the point of the Blocker label if it doesn't actually block anything? I thought that was exactly to make sure somebody reviews this before the release. Maybe that somebody would decide that its not important enough, but we should at the very least review it and remove the blocker label before a release.

I don't want to start another process discussion here, but for the record:

I think it would be a better policy in these cases to first notify those involved in the ticket ("I don't think this should block the release"). Then give it at least a day for discussion. If agreement can't be reached, bring it to a vote on sage-devel.

It used to reliably happen on my NixOS (linux) laptop. At the same time it wouldn't happen on my desktop with the exact same dependencies and in the same sandbox.

I just tried reproducing it with 8.4.beta6 on my laptop and I cannot. So maybe it is fixed, maybe the conditions triggering it have changed a bit.
