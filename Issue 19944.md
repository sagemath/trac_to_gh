Keywords: IMA-PolyGeom

This is a follow-up on #17830 and #18819.

#17830 made this possible:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3)))
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
True
```

But if one uses `number_field_elements_from_algebraics`, one gets only non-embedded number field elements:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K, cbrt2, hom = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3)))
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
False            # (an perhaps an error in Python 3?)
```

This ticket adds an option `embedded` to create embedded number field elements.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K, cbrt2, hom = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(AA.polynomial_root(x^3-2, RIF(0,3)), embedded=True)
sage: 6064/4813 < cbrt2 < 90325/71691
True
```

Okay. I added some tests and now it seems to work.

With the current commit, I have one failing doctest for which I do not know what to do:

```
File "qqbar.py", line 2098, in sage.rings.qqbar.number_field_elements_from_algebraics
Failed example:
    number_field_elements_from_algebraics(rt2c)
Expected:
    (Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 + 2*y^2 + 4, 1/2*a^3, Ring morphism:
        From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 + 2*y^2 + 4
        To:   Algebraic Field
        Defn: a |--> -0.7071067811865475? - 1.224744871391589?*I)
Got:
    (Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2, a, Ring morphism:
       From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2
       To:   Algebraic Real Field
       Defn: a |--> 1.414213562373095?)
```

This is in the tests section and the explanation given is exactly a situation that we have to outsmart when we want to be able to accept cyclotomic fields elements to be parsed to real embedded number fields.

It seems to me that the proposed code improves the situation as Sage now recognize that it is a real number... I can not see a reason right now to go against that. Am I missing something?

Some quick comments. It is considered a bad practice to have bare `except:` statements. It is probably sufficient to catch `ValueError` and `TypeError`. Also, the standard doc format for `INPUT:` would be

```
    - ``numbers`` -- a number or list of numbers

    - ``minimal`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to minimize the
      degree of the extension

    - ``same_field`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); see below

    - ``embedded`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to make the
      :func:`NumberField` embedded

    - ``prec`` -- integer (default: ``53``); the number of bit of precision for
      the embedding
```

Note that with your current branch, the replacement of the `RR(elt)` by `RIF(elt)` works.

The reason you get the infinite recursion is somewhere in the number field coercion (conversion?)( code, it is trying to construct a complex number, which then tries to create the `RR`, but it cannot do that, so it tried to construct a number field element, and hence the cycle. Or something like that. The reason it normally doesn't cycle is because it separately knows how to get the the information it needs (if it even falls into this cycle). I don't completely understand the mechanism, but this is what the traceback is suggesting to me.

Note that #15114 is for removing this coercion, but is currently blocked by more or less the same issues with comparisons between elements of different parents that need to be solved for the Python 3 transition.

Just as a summary here are things that need to be done (maybe some of them are already done):

- you may want to patch `as_number_field_element()` too,
- don't forget to add tests covering the case where some or all of the elements are rationals or elements of quadratic extensions (rationals, quadratic number field elements and higher-degree number field elements don't have exactly the same interface...) 
- Fix doctest in File "qqbar.py", line 2098, in sage.rings.qqbar.number_field_elements_from_algebraics
- `as_number_field_element` needs to pass on its new arguments, and corresponding doctests should be added. 
- Fix Comment 34 and Comment 36.
