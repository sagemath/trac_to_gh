CC:  @defeo

Many functions in `src/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` are just manual copies of auto-generated code. Remove those functions, but keep the doctests in `src/sage/libs/pari/tests.py`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20219

There was no doctest for `vecmin`, `vecmax`, `elltaniyama`, `bnfcertify`, `bnfunit`, `idealval`, `nfsubfields`,  .Would it be possible to provide one to check that the methods exist?

The methods `idealintersection`, ` reverse`, `order`, ` listinsert`, `listput` were simply removed. You should provide deprecation and test it.

Finally, could you change the doctest

```
     sage: var('x')
     x
     sage: pari(x).ceil()
     x
```

to

```
    sage: pari(SR.var('x')).ceil()

I don't see the point. We provide the functions exposed by PARI/GP. If these functions are used in Sage library code, there is an implicit test that they work. If they are not used, I don't see why it's our business to check that PARI/GP has a `vecmin()` function for example.

`idealintersection` and `reverse` are tested in `tests.py`. The last three indeed disappeared.
