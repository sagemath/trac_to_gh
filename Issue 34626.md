# Issue 34626: construct QuadraticForm from polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34863

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-12-19 15:25:59

`QuadraticForm` objects have a `.polynomial()` method to return the quadratic form represented as a multivariate polynomial, but the converse is not currently available. This patch adds it.

```
+        Construct a :class:`BinaryQF` from a bivariate polynomial
+        with integer coefficients. Converse of :meth:`polynomial`.
```


I think that should be "inverse"

Other than that, LGTM.

Thanks! Changed the word and setting to positive review under the assumption that that's what your comment:4 meant.
