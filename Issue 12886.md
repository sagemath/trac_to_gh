Thanks! Here's a reviewer patch.

For future reference, if you have a long string literal which you want to split into pieces, you can do it by just placing the strings next to each other separated by whitespace:


```python
>>> "a" "b" == "ab"
True
```


This is actually more efficient than writing `"a" + "b"`, because it is parsed directly as `"ab"`, whereas with `"a" + "b"`, Python first creates two string objects `"a"` and `"b"`, and then concatenates them together into a new string object `"ab"`, which essentially causes two useless objects to be created.

I decreased the indentation of some lines in the doctest by two spaces because later, once David Roe's work at #12415 fixes #10458, the `...` can be replaced with `....:` (two characters more) without making the indent excessively wide.

By the way, why

```
edge_list = [] 
for u, v in edges: 
   edge_list.append((int(u),int(v))) 

   g = graph.Graph(edge_list, pos={}) 
```

and not 

```
   g = graph.Graph([(int(u),int(v)) for u,v in edges], pos={})

The latter is not only shorter and more readable, but faster, too...

```python

for u, v in edges:

g = graph.Graph(edge_list, pos={})

If the last line had been indented like Dima said it would be much, much worse :P

An even faster way is probably the following:


```python
g = graph.Graph(((int(u), int(v)) for u,v in edges), pos={})
```


And we shouldn't need `pos={}` in order to use `_circle_embedding()` and `_line_embedding()` either.

Good catch, Dima - not sure why I missed that...
