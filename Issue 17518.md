I have it running in an LXC container: root on host, root inside, server user, worker user, all give 0022 umask. The system is Debian Wheezy with some backports (like new kernel).

Not really, since all this happens serially. The client computes something (which might include saving graphics), then sends a message to the server that it is finished.

> Just out of curiosity, do you two have restrictive umasks?
No, the reason the graphics file ends up with `0600` permission is the fact that it is created as temporary file. And temporary files have `0600` permissions by default.
