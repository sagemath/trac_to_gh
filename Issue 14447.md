# Issue 14447: Patch numpy so that scipy correctly detects ATLAS on FreeBSD

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14651

Original creator: jpflori

Keywords: numpy scipy atlas spkg freebsd

Scipy uses files from Numpy to detect ATLAS.
On FreeBSD, Numpy looks for ATLAS files with _r prefix and other strange names, sot it fails to correctly detect it, with Sage's ATLAS and FreeBSD's ATLAS.
