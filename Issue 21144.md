1. The argument `category` is never used.

2. `gens` is never `None`.

3. We can get rid of `_ngens_` which appears only in `_populate_generators_` but is never actually called.

Could move the entire logic into that branch `Parent`. `_populate_generators_` is only called there and never overriden/used elsewhere?

I would prefer keeping all the generators stuff into one place (for now `CategoryObject`). Starting splitting it between `CategoryObject` and `Parent` will make it harder for #21380.

Can we stick to just the contents of this ticket? We can still move it later.
