Here's an spkg updating jmol to 11.8.6 (we currently have 11.6.something).

Hrm, with this spkg in 4.1.2.alpha1 there seems to be no  lighting on the top of the surface. I'll attach a screenshot.

Jonathan: I notice lighting like this in the jmol from #11503 as well.  Do you know what the problem is?

This ticket is about an spkg, but we are doing all we can to now add #11503, which is a further update.  So let's mark this ticket invalid now.

By the way, #9232 has a fix for lighting, which I am looking at right now.
