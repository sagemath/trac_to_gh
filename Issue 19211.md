One thing that might be slightly controversial is that I construct an explicit ordering of elements used after the echelonization. However, this is needed to be stored in the submodule because if the ordering of the ambient changes (which it can by the `set_order` method), this could break the triangularity of the `lift` map. This also allowed me to construct submodules of infinite-dimensional modules.

So doctests were failing elsewhere because `_support_order` was also an attribute used by the submodules. So I refactored the method to now be called `_compute_support_order`. I also found some other issues with `to/from_vector` not being consistent in their parameters. Doctests that were failing now pass.
