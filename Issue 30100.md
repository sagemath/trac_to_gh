# Issue 30100: Graphs: obtain distance-regular graphs from generalised quadrangles

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30337

Original creator: @Ivo-Maffei

Original creation time: 2020-08-11 17:32:53

CC:  dimpase

Added code that constructs distance-regular graphs from generalised quadrangles with spread.
Also added a function that checks whether an distance-regular graph can be built using the method above.

I still got Memory Error in the longest bilinear forms graphs test, 
so here is an optimisation that reduces memory consumption by packing matrices into `int`, with it all tests pass.

Is this conversion to integers needed for the other forms graphs?

it certainly lowers memory consumption, but I would not worry too much about it.
There are much better ways to handle this, as implemented in GAP package GRAPE.

Does that really test a code path that cannot be tested in <1s?


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-08-29 08:30:44

I cannot reproduce the error.

All my code do is calling `Graph(edges, format='list_of_edges')`.
The `edges` list is **long** (6652854) but I believe the code path (i.e. the full stack of function calls) should not differ from `Graph([(0,1)], format='list_of_edges')`.

I can change the doctest to importing `BilinearFormsGraph` directly from `sage.graphs.generators.distance_regular` if this solves the issue, but I don't know how to test it myself.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-29 09:34:23

I agree with Volker (vbraun) that this doctest takes way too long.
Mark it `not tested` and add `graphs.BilinearFormsGraph(3,4,2)` instead - this takes <3 sec.

Please run

```
./sage -tp --long --verbose src/sage/graphs/generators/distance_regular.pyx
```

to see what tests are the longest. This file is still by far the slowest to test in `sage/graphs/`,
3 times as long as anything else there.
`GrassmannGraph(2, 6, 3)` and `DoubleGrassmannGraph(3, 2)` are the two slowest ones (>30 sec each on my oldish X1 Carbon Lenovo, and they aren't even tagged `long time`!), but there are more.

I marked everything that took more than 1s as long.

I think one should change the default value for --warn-long (it is usually 2 min) if 30s are long.

Comment by vbraun created at 2020-08-30 08:40:07

The buildbot limits the available memory to encourage writing efficient unit tests, hence the MemoryError

let's wait for the next beta/rc, to lessen the rebase work.

I'm having issues with beta11 not starting for an import error on libgsl.23.dylib
Has this issue been brought up yet or am I the only one?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-02 10:13:41

How do you get `gsl` in your installation? Does it come from the system/Homebrew/conda, or do you build it?


---

Comment by @Ivo-Maffei created at 2020-09-02 10:21:43

It is in sage/local/lib/.
I can send you the crash report, if you wish


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-09-02 10:30:45

gsl has been updated in just merged #29483.
Perhaps you need to run `./sage -f gsl && make build`
