# Issue 17621: "should never launch viewer in embedded mode"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17858

Get this error from 

```
L = [plot(k*x,(x,-1,1)) for k in [1..3]];G = graphics_array(L);G.show(figsize=[5,3])
```

See http://ask.sagemath.org/question/25923/runtimeerror-should-never-launch-viewer-in-embedded-mode/

Probably fallout from the earlier display hook changes.

But I guess this will be corrected in the next beta.
