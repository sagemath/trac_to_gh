In sage I have discovered 2 ways to assign weight to edges :
either by edge labels
or by using a weight function as used by shortest_path function().

Currently networkx_graph() is adding weights to networkx graph graph as its edge labels. To unify the pattern of edge weights in Sage,this method should also have weight_function() variable to be passed. It would be required if we were to use implementations of networkx algorithms in weighted graphs.



Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27496

Any suggestions whether this would be the best thing or should I try something else? 

Note:
ticket:27480 is dependent on this ticket so as Page Rank algorithm to work in case of weighted graphs.
