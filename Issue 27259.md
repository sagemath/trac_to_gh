# Issue 27259: Addition of weight_function in networkx_graph() method

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27496

In sage I have discovered 2 ways to assign weight to edges :
either by edge labels
or by using a weight function as used by shortest_path function().

Currently networkx_graph() is adding weights to networkx graph graph as its edge labels. To unify the pattern of edge weights in Sage,this method should also have weight_function() variable to be passed. It would be required if we were to use implementations of networkx algorithms in weighted graphs.

Any suggestions whether this would be the best thing or should I try something else? 

Note:
ticket:27480 is dependent on this ticket so as Page Rank algorithm to work in case of weighted graphs.

I have added the support for weight function and I have merged this branch on top of ticket:27491 to avoid any conflict.

You should add a doctest.

I have marked the dependency to #27491

LGTM.

I have changed the milestone to 8.8 as this ticket will not be included in .rc released.
