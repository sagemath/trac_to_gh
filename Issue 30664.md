# Issue 30664: sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename: Fix for MULTIARCH

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30901

Original creator: @tobiasdiez

Original creation time: 2020-11-12 09:58:47

CC:  @tobiasdiez fbissey thansen embray dimpase

On distributions that use the multiarch installation scheme, python provides the `MULTIARCH` sysconfig variable. 

We modify `sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename` to use it.
(Currently it tries to use `MULTILIB` which does not exist.)
Moreover, I took the opportunity to refactor the code in the `_get_shared_lib_filename` method to use `pathlib`.

(extracted from #30371)

Why does it change the code for Cygwin? Beyond the scope of the ticket.

And why does it change the doctest to `pattern = "*/lib*Singular-*.so"`? My guess is that this is untested.

Thanks for the review!

I had to change the Cygwin code as it previously took the last match of `search_directories`, but on the other OS it was the first match. Thus, in order to unify the code I had to change the order. Please view this as part of "Moreover, I took the opportunity to refactor the code in the _get_shared_lib_filename method to use pathlib.".

For the doctest change, the method returns the following path on my system: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsingular-Singular-4.1.1.so`. This is because of the `resolve()` statement, which follows symlinks. I had to add `resolve()` since otherwise the singular library doesn't initialize correctly.

If you want to make changes to the Cygwin code, then you'll have to test it on Cygwin as well. We have a severe shortage of Cygwin developers/testers and we cannot just replace tested code by untested code.

That make sense, I was under the impression that you also have CI for cygwin.

I have tested the code manually during development. After `sudo touch /usr/bin/cygSingular-test.dll` the following script


```
import sysconfig
import sys
from sage.env import _get_shared_lib_path

print(sysconfig.get_config_var('BINDIR'))

sys.platform = 'cygwin'
print(_get_shared_lib_path("Singular"))

```


returns, as expected,


```
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/cygSingular-test.dll
```

GH Actions cygwin build is very flaky, as it has to be done in stages due to time limits.
We need a dedicated Cygwin runner (GH Actions supports selfhosted runners) to improve it, so that it can be done in one go, I think.

I think the error handling in `src/sage/libs/singular/singular.pyx` should not be removed because `SINGULAR_SO` can be set via `sage_conf` and hence in this case it is not guaranteed by the new code in `sage.env` that the file exists

There were two existence checks in `singular.pyx`. The current version still contains `if not SINGULAR_SO or not os.path.exists(SINGULAR_SO)`.

By the way, I didn't change the variables to `Path`. That was the case in a previous version, but for the sage of keeping the changes confined I've removed it again.

Thanks for pointing this out. But then I think the renaming of `_get_shared_lib_filename` to `_get_shared_lib_path` also should not be done.

Also, please let's get rid of the helper function `_get_sage_local`.

The Cygwin tests are now a bit more robust and although it did not run through completely because of an unrelated problem, it seems OK.

But it's the complete path (as a string) that is returned, and not just the name of the file (relative to some folder).

OK, fine
