Needs a rebase. Also, if you could move the references to the master list.

Thank you. I know this is probably bikeshedding, but I feel like the missing inputs should raise a `ValueError` instead of a `TypeError` because the value is missing. However, I don't have a strong opinion, so no matter which you think is better, you can set a positive review on my behalf once you also break this long line:

Python uses `TypeError` whenever a function is called with the wrong arguments. By analogy I'm raising `TypeError` here.

Ah, right. Thanks.

If you could just break that one long line, then positive review.
