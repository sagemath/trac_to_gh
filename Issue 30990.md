(from #31132)

This python3 (3.8.2) is not able to build extension modules because it emits `-arch arm64 -arch x86_64` unless `ARCHFLAGS` is set explicitly

```
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m sysconfig |grep '\bCFLAGS ='
	CFLAGS = "-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -iwithsysroot/System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/PrivateHeaders -iwithsysroot/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers -arch arm64 -arch x86_64"

	CFLAGS = "-Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -Wunreachable-code -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -iwithsysroot/System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/PrivateHeaders -iwithsysroot/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers  -arch x86_64 "

In this ticket, we set `ARCHFLAGS` during this configure step...

No, sorry for the false report. Having run `./bootstrap`, and with `local/bin/python3` a symlink pointing to `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/python3`, the build has now failed twice: `Pillow` and `cython` have both failed to build.

Yes. I replaced the old `config.log`, since that was a result of my error, not a problem with this ticket.

What I find a bit confusing is the following:

We do not test, whether setting `ARCHFLAGS=""` was necesarry in order to build this test extension during configure

Why do we expect that in real life situations (when actually compiling python extensions for sage) `ARCHFLAGS=""` is not a requirement anymore?

```

This does not work for me with OS X Big Sur, though: many packages (cython, pynac, gmpy2, psutil, pillow, kiwisolver, cffi) fail to build with the error "clang: error: the clang compiler does not support '-march=native'".

Hold on, I have to run `./bootstrap` and try again.

Confirmed, these packages all fail after

```
make distclean && ./bootstrap && ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 && make -k
```

Some results have been coming in:

- `local-homebrew-macos-11.0-xcode-11.7-{minimal,standard}`: Homebrew complains that xcode is too old

Still waiting for the tests with other xcode versions (12.2, 12.3, 12.4). No failures so far.

Note all runs are on `x86_64` - we do not have test infrastructor for `macos-arm64` yet.

ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.14.6)

which is probably because the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET for /usr/bin/python3 is set to 10.14.6 which doesn't match what Homebrew sets. It's easy enough to eliminate the warnings by setting MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 before doing all the testing.
