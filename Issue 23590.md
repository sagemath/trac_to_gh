#14825 introduced an iterator for p-adic expansions, which is capable of calculating the `n`th term in the expansion quickly using division (rather than computing all of the digits up to that point):

```
sage: R = Zp(5, 1000000)
sage: a = R.random_element()
sage: E = a.expansion()
sage: E[876543]
4
```

The same functionality should be available when using a balanced expansion:

```
sage: E = a.expansion(lift_mode='smallest')
sage: E[876543] # did not terminate
```
