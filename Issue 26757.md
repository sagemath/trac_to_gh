The graph6 strings `Cr` and `C]` indeed corresponds to graphs on 4 vertices (isomorphic but not equal)

```
sage: G1 = Graph("Cr")
sage: G2 = Graph("C]")
sage: G1 == G2
False
sage: G1.is_isomorphic(G2) and G2.is_isomorphic(G1)
True
```

Still on [SageMath](SageMath) 8.6.beta0 the canonical labeling is `Cr`

```
sage: G1.canonical_label() == G1 and G2.canonical_label() == G1
True
```

Hence the code in the doctest should have been added `Cr` in the database and not `C]` as it is currently written.

see #26800

This ticket is a duplicate of #26920 which I open about 2 weeks ago. I suggest to close #26920 since the one here seems more alive.

See #25399 for another recent ticket fixing doctests failures related to bliss.

Replying to [comment:4 chapoton]:
> see #26800

The failure in this ticket is not Python 3 related. Both Sage and bliss provides canonical labelings but different ones.

Comment by embray created at 2019-01-02 15:43:43

Being that bliss is an optional package, should this be a blocker?  I'm not sure what the latest consensus is on that (being that there is an unfortunate lack--for some reason--of buildbots that test optional packages).  It doesn't seem to be a particularly substantive failure either.

Changing keywords from "" to "graph, database".


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-01-02 18:07:12

The canonical label of a graph depends on the algorithm used to compute it. See the note in the documentation of `canonical_label`: Make sure you always compare canonical forms obtained by the same algorithm.

So a simple fix is to force `algorithm='sage'` in the doctest.
