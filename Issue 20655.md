It finds my Fink installation (though I removed it from PATH for building Sage) -- should this be disabled?
It does not find Perl -- should I install it in Fink or should we have a Perl package in Sage as a prerequisite?

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-06-27 16:55:42

this might be a mismatch between the code emitted by quite new gcc and old assembler, which is unable to compile this into binary. There were a number of such OSX-only reports recently, check the sage-develop...


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-06-27 16:57:16

yeah, try to move Fink totally to some /opt/blah place and try again...


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-06-27 17:10:16

OK. After hiding Fink, I get:

```
[polymake-3.0r1] checking fink installation ... The Fink package system is a mandatory prerequisite to build and use polymake under MacOS.
[polymake-3.0r1] Please refer to http://www.polymake.org/doku.php/mac for details and installation instructions.
[polymake-3.0r1] If you already have Fink installed at a non-standard location, please specify it using option --with-fink
```


I'll start again with a fresh install of Fink and install some perl there.

I will first try to install polymake from source outside of Sage -- this already fails on my machine; I have asked in the Polymake forum for help.

Vincent: I think the right package to use in Sage would be the "minimal" package which picks up cdd, lrs, nauty from the Sage distribution.

See #20894 for a first step towards an OS X build

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-06-28 01:03:38

I solved the problem on Mac OS X with the following patch for Polymake, which gets rid of various "-arch" options. The "-arch" options caused the above errors "register %rbp is only available in 64-bit mode" etc.

Can you make a package with this?  I tried to test it by creating the right patch directory and changing the spkg-install for applying patches but I tend to always make a mess of that.  Anyway, having done that, it did get quite a bit further (including #20894) though I did get some warnings e.g.

```
[polymake-3.0r1] bundled extension group ... disabled because of unsatisfied prerequisite: lrs
```

But anyway it is making vastly more progress than before, so please bundle this up and with any luck I can help give positive review (I'm assuming it will take a little longer than I want to stay up now to finish!).  Great, great work.

Yes, I also get a few of those, but the polymake install goes through after that. Details of the 'bundled extensions' can be found in the package build directory (`$SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build/polymake-3.0r1/src/build.darwin.x86_64/bundled.log`):


```
Configuration of the following bundled extensions failed, proceeding without them.
If you really need them, please carefully read the following explanations,
take the suggested actions, and repeat the configuration.

---- bliss ----

Could not compile a test program checking for bliss library.
The most probable reasons are that the library is installed at a non-standard location,
is not configured to build a shared module, or missing at all.
The complete error log follows:

Please install the library and specify its location using --with-bliss option, if needed.
Please remember to enable shared modules when configuring the bliss library!

If you are running a Debian system and now see some missing GMP functions in the error message,
then you've got an old broken bliss package;  please upgrade it to the latest version.

```


I don't know what bliss is but I tried to install it -- but it gave me an error. Reported on #20871.


```
---- lrs ----

Could not compile a test program checking for lrs library.
The most probable reasons are that the library is installed at a non-standard location,
is not configured to build a shared module, or missing at all.
The complete error log follows:

I do have lrslib installed. This needs investigating.

---- singular ----

I think singular is standard, but there seems to be no `libsingular-config`.



```

Could not compile a test program checking for SoPlex.
Please make sure SoPlex was compiled with 'GMP=true' and 'SHARED=true'
and specify its location using --with-soplex=PATH.

OK, yes, we don't have SoPlex. This is part of the SCIP Optimization Suite. (#10879)

Apparently it needs the shared library. This is #20886.

They might. I do have them installed on my Linux system. From the log, it is impossible to tell how polymake configure script actually finds bliss. I have one from the system and one in Sage. And with the very same version

```
$ bliss -version
bliss version 0.72
$ sage -sh -c "bliss -version"
bliss version 0.72
```

Oh yeah, fair enough!

I would say that having a sensible message when installing this package that says "here is what you will miss out on" would be worthwhile, but this shouldn't hold up getting this in so people have at least some polymake functionality.

Not really. #20894 adds the one missing bit that is not standard on OS X and which is "tricky to install".

For now on we can just mark them as `# not tested` or `# bug`. Anyway the `polymake.py` file is completely broken and should be replaced by something that works (like pypolymake).

<joke>Is featureful a word?  I prefer OED to Wiktionary :)</joke>

That's too bad about the bliss package on Sage.  How easy is it to install some of those non-Sage package things on OS X?   (I'm  not planning to test this, just asking in case that will be useful to users.)

Also,

```
+Also this old-style Sage package can be installed for a more
+featureful Polymake installation:
+ sage -p qhull
+
+Software that would need to be installed manually (no Sage package
+ available) for a more featureful Polymake installation:
+ azove,
+ porta,
+ vinci,
+ SplitsTree4,
+ bliss 
```

Should this information be in a place beyond the SPKG.txt, which after all no one except developers will read?  (And then could be put in a md or rst format...)  Sorry for the interloping.

It depends. Ideally we should probably have Sage packages -- this is now task ticket #20977.

Well, 

```
sage -info polymake
```

would display this information. 

I guess it would make sense to generate some documentation from it automatically. I'm not sure if the existence of packages is advertised anywhere except in the source tree. I always just try "sage -i PACKAGENAME" and when it starts looking for old-style stuff, I hit C-c.

I don't know. There is no inverse for `cpan -i`, so it's unclear how to check.

According to https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=517:

 Currently polymake does not have any provisions for finding the nauty package outside own source code. I'd suggest you use the complete source tarball of polymake instead of the "minimal" one; you can disable undesired extensions via configuration like this: --without-jreality.

This should be trivial to patch... I don't think we want a megatarball.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-07-15 15:07:26

The "minimal tarball" that we use omits not only the nauty sources, but also polymake's interface to it (see https://github.com/mkoeppe/polymake/tree/sage-package/bundled/nauty) 
So it's not just a matter of patching someone's configure scripts.

It appears that a polymake install can only use bliss OR nauty. So I think I'll ignore nauty for now and fix bliss instead (#20901).

No. It works without error on my machine (Mac OS X).

The thing is that the above did not interrupt the build (still waiting for the end of compilation...). I discovered them by grepping my install.log. I will tell what is happening with bliss, cdd, lrs and ppl interfaces inside polymake.

As it is an experimental package we should get it into early sage-7.4 beta for more feedback!

OK, I was able to reproduce this on an Ubuntu box. One of my patches for Mac OS X is to blame. Working on it.

Branch has now merged the bliss ticket (#20901).

#21175 (Set ARCHFLAGS environment variable - for Perl modules) would make polymake's `spkg-install` simpler.

It's now working on Ubuntu (and still on Mac OS X), please test.

Better. Build without any error and

```
polytope > show_unconfigured;
vinci.rules
  ...
azove.rules
  ...
splitstree.rules
  ...
latte.rules
  ...
topcom.rules
  ...
porta.rules
  ...
common::property_viewer.rules
common::povray.rules
  ...
common::geomview.rules
  ...
To enable an interface:  reconfigure("RULEFILE");
```

However, after switching back to the develop branch doing `sage -b` gives me

```
/opt/sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/graphs/bliss.cpp:317:20fatal error: graph.hh: No such file or directory
```

Yes, that's normal. Need to keep #20901 in your branch if you have installed the bliss package from #20901.

It works well on top of 7.4.beta0. Setting to positive review in order to be easily available for testing.

For those who really know this stuff, on a related note: http://ask.sagemath.org/question/34457/why-cant-i-compute-the-ehrhart-polynomial-of-a-polytope/?answer=34458#post-id-34458 so hopefully it will be more obvious soon what to do for this type of user.

People [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/wgoeFgYzgZw/Yihv5VCFBgAJ) that building Singular with polymake (not this one, a systemwide one) installed leads to a problem. This ought to be investigated.
