Hi David. I'm CCing you because you reviewed #12461. Maybe you can review this ticket (and #13255, #13258) as well. Thanks.

As opposed to #13258, this one has a lot of whitespace removal, including some which is definitely gratuitous and could cause unnecessary rebasing.  Can you post a patch like this but without the whitespace changes?  My comment about Python 3 at #13255 stands too, but is less important.

Okay, this is okay.  Hopefully it won't cause too much trouble.  I almost feel like it's a good opportunity to actually doctest all these many potential raised errors like

```
sage: k,n = var('k,n')
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_sum(k * binomial(n, k), k, k, n)
ValueError: summation limits must not depend on the summation variable
```

but that would be beyond this ticket.  Feel free to do it!
