Two methods in schemes/generic/homset.py contain a comparison 'R == Z' instead of 'R == ZZ'. 

Both methods don't have any doctests.

Apparently this was introduced in [changeset:15345:08d4a1aad8b5].

About the doctests, could you provide some example which triggers the bug? We could probably use that for the doctest.

See also #11526.

I changed the #11526 patch to also fix the typo in the projective case.

Replying to [comment:6 saraedum]:

Oops. Should have read what was written in the ticket. Setting an author here doesn't make much sense.

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.1.beta0:

```
patching file sage/schemes/generic/homset.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 159
Hunk #2 FAILED at 218
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/schemes/generic/homset.py.rej
```
