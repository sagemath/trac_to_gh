Three more corrections needed at the same places:

+            triangle. This method is generaly faster than standard matrix
```

associated in

```
-              Cartier. We return wheher this associtated divisor is nef.
+              Cartier. We return whether this associtated divisor is nef.
```


Capital F for Fourier in

```
-    Solves sytem of inequalities using Maxima and fourier elimination
+    Solves system of inequalities using Maxima and fourier elimination
```

Once done, you can set to positive review
