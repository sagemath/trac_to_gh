Implementation of k-regular sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-regular_sequence).

---
**Roadmap:**
- basic:
  - #21295: recognizable series and the minimization algorithm
  - #21203: basic element and parent for k-regular sequences
- arithmetic:
  - enable coercions and functorial constructions
  - #21318: scalar multiplication
  - #21318: addition/subtraction
  - #21325: subsequences, shift
  - #21325: forward/backward differences, partial summation
  - conversion of automatic sequences to formal series via Christol's theorem and vice versa
  - #21319: hashing, equality testing, TestSuite
- #21204: guessing k-regular sequences from the first few values
- getting k-regular sequences from given recurrence relations:
  - #27940: basic methods, with symbolic equations as input
  - #32198, #31787: alternative input parameters (without symbolic ring)
  - #32921: deal with inhomogeneities
- #22964: boundedness
- other:
  - #21343: deal with mu[0]*right != right in k-regular sequences
- related tickets:
  - #21205: bounds for the joint spectral radius

Please, try to not add one more class for sequences. There are already
- lazy lists in `sage.misc.lazy_list`
- words in `sage.combinat.words`
- C finite sequence in `sage.rings.cfinite_sequence`
- paths of directed graphs in `quivers.paths.pyx`
Would be nice to unify them at some point.

None of the below does what k-regular sequence do, so how to accomplish working with k-regular sequences by not adding another class? ;)

To make it clear: A k-regular sequence is a very concrete object with rules how to manipulate them. I am **not** intending to add a kind of **metaclass** for sequences.

> There are already
> - lazy lists in `sage.misc.lazy_list`


Are more like a data structure behind; do not fit into the parent/element scheme of [SageMath](SageMath).

> - words in `sage.combinat.words`


Of course, generalizing words sufficiently, then more or less every sequence is a word. k-regular sequences have values in ZZ or QQ or something else. Moreover, they have a kind of rich arithmetic structure, which has to be implemented.

> - C finite sequence in `sage.rings.cfinite_sequence`


This is probably closest to k-regular sequences, but in some sense, k-regular sequence are more general, in some sense, they are orthogonal to C-finite sequences. Thus this cannot be used very well.

> - paths of directed graphs in `quivers.paths.pyx`


Never seen before, but for sure something different.

> Would be nice to unify them at some point.


I completely agree. Any ideas how to accomplish this? The category framework might help...
