Starting with v61, setuptools (experimentally) support pyproject.toml for configuration, see https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1688. Moreover, setup.cfg will eventually be deprecated so it's a good idea to migrate from cfg to toml.

Migration can probably be done using https://ini2toml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html.
