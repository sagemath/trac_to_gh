As per #30596#comment:4, #30596 leads to some missing symbols in linking on Gentoo with gcc-10.

The first consequence of it, is failing to build the documentation:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from sage_setup.docbuild import main

```


Only 3 symbols from `bitset_intrinsics.h` are missing

```
ldd -r /dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_8/build/lib/sage/data_structures/bitset.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so | grep _bit

undefined symbol: _bitset_isempty       (/dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_8/build/lib/sage/data_structures/bitset.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)

```

Declaring those three inline functions as `static` fix the problem. This probably implies that the `inline` keyword semantic from C99+ is involved.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

`@`tscrim would you be so good as to check that it doesn't create problems for you?

My changes are only the last commit of course.

Ok, I think I understand now.

This helped me:

http://gudok.xyz/inline/

It seems that there are three solutions to this:

- declare the function as `static`, as you did
- add a file `bitset_intrinsics.c` and declare the functions in there `extern inline ...`; I don't know how well this plays with cython
- go for C++ and should be fine

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-09-28 07:22:46

Yes, that would sum it up. And I think that option 2 would be problematic but I wouldn't know before trying for real. I hadn't thought about going full C++ (because I hate C++) but that would be a viable option.

But then all of the functions should be made static, shouldn't they.

This problem will also show up, when you compile a debug version, because then nothing will be inlined and nothing will work anymore.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-09-28 07:47:31

At the moment, I don't see a need of going C++. It might arise at some point however, in particular because C++ supports templates. So far, I'm handling the templates via fused types in cython, that also works.

I must say, I am still wondering why just those 3. But if we are both in agreement that they should all be made static then I'll do that. I hadn't thought of doing a debug version but yes it should be more revealing.

This issue also appears on Gentoo with gcc9. An incremental build of vanilla from `9.2.beta13` -> `9.2.beta14` without this branch gives

```

This branch does allow the html-docs to build.

Changing priority from critical to blocker.
