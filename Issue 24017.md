CC:  simonking nthiery

`Parent.is_coercion_cached` and `Parent.is_conversion_cached` are:
- not documented
- trivial (`return domain in self._coerce_from_hash`)
- useless for most users
- appear nowhere in the code excepted in two doctests

I propose to get rid of them.

Overall, I agree, but `self._coerce_from_hash` is not public nor Python accessible. So you could not simply replace the call in unital algebras. So I think we should document them and make them hidden functions.

I agree with that suggestion. I.e., do not remove it completely, but hide and document it.
