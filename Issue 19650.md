CC:  akoutsianas

Keywords: S-unit equation

Angelos Koutsianas has written code to solve general 3-term S-unit equations over Q, i.e. to find all solutions to x+y=1 where x,y are rationals supported on the primes in a given finite set S.  This is based on de Weger's thesis.

The code is currently being tested, and will be made into a new branch here.

I think we need to added the new file S_unit_equation.py to the reference manual, and I will try to do that.  Also, the file aith.py was moved and I am not sure that the reference manual has been adjusted correctly.

The docstrings now look OK, though perhaps not all functions are explained adequately (and the specific reference should be checked as I was not sure which were to Smart and which to  de Weger).  I am finished with this code for now.
