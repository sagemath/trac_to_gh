Two questions that sound overly critical, but are really just out of curiosity:
* Curious why you ported these forward right now; the current release manager has been skeptical of changes hitting many files that are mainly cosmetic (like whitespace), since it means a lot of rebasing for others (or can, anyway) - not that these won't be very needed eventually, but we aren't switching to Python 3 anytime soon.
* Why not also move to the new string formatting syntax for these (ones only)?  The "percent" style wouldn't work in Python 3 either, so the job is sort of half done.

I had a look at the patch "trac 13255: replace some deprecated python functions in sage/misc".

There are about 51 affected modules. 4 of them have a new line `from __future__ import print_function`. 

But there are also modules with the new function `print()` but no `from __future__`. An example is `/src/sage/misc/attached_files.py`.

How can this work?

In these cases it's still the print statement and not the function that is used. The parentheses are ignored like in

```
sage: a = (5)
sage: a
5
```

so in most cases you can write
`print("some string")` instead of `print "some string"` without using `from __future__`

Yes, meanwhile I have also discovered it while working on ticket:15989.

But apparently the tool 2to3 fix_print (or futurize fix_print_with_import) does not detect this case and wraps another pair of parenthesis around it.

Maybe we should not add `from __future__ import print_function` but just make sure that the print statement has those extra parenthesis?

I will mention this in ticket:15989.

In my opinion we should use `from __future__ import print_function` if necessary. It's a simple way to get python 2 and python 3 compatible `print`.

Looks good to and all doctests pass.

`from __future__ import print_function` is apparently only added when trailing "," are converted to `end=" "`.

Currently I would suggest NOT to wrap the print parameters with parenthesis in //doctests// as this might be handled be a new version of the preparser (see also ticket:15989).

BTW: I hope the changes to the `raise` statements will not interfere to much with ticket:15990.

I tested the change OK.

While I went through the patch I did some polishing and added it to a reviewer patch.


If you agree with my branch, you can set this to positive review. Otherwise set your latest patch to positive review.

The majority of changes simplify `"{0}{1}{2}"` to `"{}{}{}"`. Since Python 2.7 (and Python 3.1) the positional argument specifiers can be omitted [Format strings](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/string.html#formatstrings).
