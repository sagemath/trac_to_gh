Is this a new header that need installing?

No, the fix is trivial:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/symbolic/ginac.pxd b/src/sage/symbolic/ginac.pxd

```


But I am looking for other instances of the same problem.

There is a different unrelated issue:

```

This C++ code is compiled as C because the `cython()` command ignores the `# distutils: language=c++` on top of `ginac.pxd`

Maybe we should use distutils to implement `cython()`?

That's a little bit over my head because I am unfamiliar with the code but the idea sounds OK.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-06-30 09:31:43

Oh wait that's not building, that's from sage itself. There is definitely room for improvement in that code.

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-06-30 09:48:19

I think this fixes all instances of include files outside of `sage/ext` which were included in `.pxd` files without a full path.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-06-30 09:59:06

I think you got everything.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-07-02 09:25:44

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-07-02 09:25:44

Somehow I missed the `need_review` bit.

Replying to [comment:3 jdemeyer]:
> Maybe we should use distutils to implement `cython()`?

Actually, we do use `distutils`. I think the problem is really the "preparsing" that Sage does with the input of `cython()`.

Well, actually there is one more instance at #18833 (where the header file is just removed).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-07-02 11:17:38

Well that's lucky it is being removed.
