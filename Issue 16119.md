Please don't set tickets to positive review that you don't want merged

This is my mistake. I am very sorry.
(this is some rest of the old mercurial workflow)

Ok. I rebased on the new #16295 at public/16295.

Please Nathann have a quick look.

Comment by ncohen created at 2014-06-12 13:39:04

What did you rebase ? For me public/16295 is equal to u/ncohen16295.

My mistake... it is not anymore. The git rebase does not move the current branch to another position.

Still the same for me. BTW don't use "rebase" (it rewrites the history) but merge !

It is not. If you fetch public/16356 the last commit is 7475474b531df3ef96d218e93045d24d254cff3c being different from the one here. So the rebase just worked.

Why on earth would you rebase the whole branch ? It will make all commits incompatible !

Actually it is just the rebase of one commit. You prefer to have a merge and keep this commit unchanged ?

....

If you rebase this commit, then all patches above have to be updated.

And basically all design branches in `needs_review` are above this one at the moment.

Anyway there is no need to merge this branch with the updated #16295, because there are no merge conflicts. And the tests pass.
