CC:  @vbraun @jdemeyer @embray

By removing the del of imports in sage/all*.py

To be done in a beta containing all the previous tickets on print.

This will depend on an update of sagenb.

To be postponed by another ticket cleaning the last traces of py2 print.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20668

We should only do this if we also change the Sage command line to use Python 3 `print()` syntax. Doctests and the command line should be consistent.

But this is obviously the goal. Why did you change the title of the ticket ?

Any reason for that change?

Well, the switch to python3 will happen once the code is entirely compatible, and this is not for tomorrow, given that **not so many people** actively work on the problem.

Besides, we are not going to force python2 users to use python3-sage. So this ticket is useful only for its branch, that allows from time to time to see that somebody has once again re-introduced a python2 print somewhere.

Volker, what do you mean exactly, please ? Do we just need to add one single line 

```
from __future__ import print_function
```

in the code of the file `src/sage/doctest/sources.py`
or is there something more subtle to do ? ( I have no idea of what is a "virtual doctest")
