A few details:

1. Replace `print(x);print(y);` by

```
print(x)
print(y)
```


2. I dislike `print((x, y))`. I suggest: for single-line doctest outputs, just use `(x, y)` instead of `print((x, y))`. For multi-line doctest outputs, I would use `print("{} : {}".format(x, y))` (and keep the doctest output as it was). That makes it more clear to read the output.

In these blocks, remove the `\n` which creates an additional empty line (it doesn't matter for the doctest because it ignores whitespace):

```
        sage: for p in P:
        ....:     print(p)
        ....:     print("\n* * *")
```
