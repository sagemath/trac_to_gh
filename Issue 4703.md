Assignee: tba

Basically added a description of making tcl/tk work in Sage as in http://wiki.sagemath.org/faq#HowtogetSage.27sPythontorecognizemysystem.27sTcl.2BAC8-Tkinstall.3F
following descriptions of William Stein and several others on sage-support (see thread titled "sage and tkinter?").
Seems to compile fine.
