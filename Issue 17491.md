As documented in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_mpfi.html#sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement.max, `max(I,J)` does not do the correct thing for real intervals, and `I.max(J)` has to be used instead.

When computing the infinity norm of a vector of real intervals, the wrong version of `max` gets used, though:


```
sage: x = RIF(1,2)
sage: y = RIF(0,4)
sage: print "Wrong max: ", max(x,y).endpoints()
Wrong max:  (1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
sage: print "Correct max: ", x.max(y).endpoints()
Correct max:  (1.00000000000000, 4.00000000000000)
sage: 
sage: v = vector([x,y])
sage: print "Computed infinity norm: ", v.norm(Infinity).endpoints()
Computed infinity norm:  (1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
```

Random thought: would it be possible to alter the behaviour of `max(x,y)`, to have it do the right thing or at least return error? It's a Python built-in, so I suspect the answer is "no, or we would have done it long ago".

If the behaviour of max cannot be changed, 
can it be forbidden in sage (e.g. by preparsing or whatever)
to use pythons max()?
