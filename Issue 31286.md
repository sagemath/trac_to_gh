After #31278, which removed heavy dependencies from `widgetsnbextension` (which is a dependency of `ipywidgets`), we have to add some (lighter) dependencies to `ipywidgets`.

https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/setup.cfg#L35
lists:

```
install_requires =
  ipykernel>=4.5.1
  ipython>=6.1.0
  traitlets>=4.3.1
  nbformat>=4.2.0
  widgetsnbextension~=4.0a0
  jupyterlab_widgets~=2.0a0
```
These are not reflected in our `dependency` file.

So far this has not caused a build failure, but it is possible that one could appear in heavily parallelized builds.

The missing dependency is visible in the testsuite run for optional package `p_group_cohomology` in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2145415988

```
