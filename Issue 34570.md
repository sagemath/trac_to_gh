# Issue 34570: Add Construction of Hadamard matrices up to order 664

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34807

Original creator: @MatteoCati

Original creation time: 2022-11-29 09:30:29

CC:  dimpase

With #34690, all the Hadamard matrices of order <=288 have been added. The next task is to implement matrices of order up to 664 (668 is the first order for which no construction is known). This will require implementing https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82189436.pdf, as well as adding some more data for the constructions that are already present.

Wow! That's impressive! Could you say a bit what's in that almost 3000 lines you add here?

- I've implemented Spence construction in `hadamard_matrix.py`. This uses the supplementary difference sets created by `supplementary_difference_set` in `difference_faimilies.py`. In the same file, the relative difference sets used by Spence to construct supplementary difference sets are created by the function `relative_difference_set`.
- In `t_sequences.py`, I've added some new T-sequences. These are constructed from base sequences using the function `T_sequences_construction_from_base_sequences` (this function was already present, but was being used only for the case when p=1). Also, base sequences are constructed from Turyn type sequences using the (new) function `base_sequences_construction` (I've also added the function `is_base_sequences_tuple`, to check that the construction is correct). Turyn type sequences are stored directly in `turyn_type_sequences_smallcases`.
- Lastly, I've added in `difference_family.py` the function `skew_supplementary_difference_set` which creates skew SDS (as described by  Djokovic in https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/10/ocr-ajc-v10-p259.pdf), which are used by `GS_skew_hadamard_smallcases` in `hadamard_matrix.py` to  create new skew Hadamard matrices.

Also, note that the older commits (up until bd025a2e87389b9b7f5573049ad62cdd087e2bf0) are coming from ticket #34690.

Does this mean that we also have new (for Sage) orders for skew Hadamard matrices?

Yes, I've added skew Hadamard matrices of order 268, 412, 452, 508, 604, 628, 652, 724, 964.

nice. 

How about bringing Sage up to date w.r.t. skew Hadamard matrices too?
I actually don't know what the 1st unknown order is in this case (something that's probably mentioned in the literature, I didn't try too hard to find this),
but I noticed that Sage does not know about orders 76, 100, and 116, whereas examples are known, see e.g.

Okay, I will open a new ticket (#34848).
