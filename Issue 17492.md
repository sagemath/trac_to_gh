#5569 implements Weil restriction (restriction of scalars) for ideals. This will extend that to affine schemes and also points and morphisms of affine schemes.

Note that when I implemented this I noticed that the original implementation for ideals was inconsistently ordering the coordinates. In particular it labelled `a^2x2 + ax1 + ax0` and then created the coordinates (x2,x1,x0) in the ring k[x0,x1,x2]. This caused issues for morphisms, so I made this consistent: i.e. coordinates (x0,x1,x2). I also allowed for weil restrictions of relative number fields (to the base field) instead of just absolute number fields. These are the only two changes to the original implementation.

Outside of the merge issue, in the affine point folder, the weil restriction function should be calling min_poly and not absolute_minpoly, otherwise it won't work for relative field extensions, (also put a better relative field extension example)

Went through and did some sanity checking, ran a long test just to be sure, looks clean, setting to positive review
