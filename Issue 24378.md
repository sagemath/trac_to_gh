While it is not a big thing, you do not seem to be using `libGAP_IS_MACFLOAT`, so I don't think we need to link to it from Sage (i.e., remove it from `gap_includes.pxd`).

Indeed it is not used. But I think that more support of libgap functions is good. Somebody might want to use it from Cython. I don't quite understand what you mean by "link it from Sage" as it is a simple declaration.

I am very mildly worried about depending on things we don't use that might result in more maintenance on our side down the road. However, that will not hold up a positive review from me.
