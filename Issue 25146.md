I'm not entirely sure that `banner` is unused. I can see that being actually used somewhere as `from sage.all import banner`. Although deprecating it cannot hurt.

The rest should be no problem.

Sage did actually have some proto-database functionality but that never really went very far.

I'm not sure that `desolve` should move; similarly with the various types of matrices.  In a lot of contexts you really want the absolutely easiest dumb-sounding command, and extra object-oriented stuff can be confusing there.

That said, most of these probably indeed are a bit specific for top-level.  Seems like the kind of thing to put on sage-devel and allow people to ask for things to be separately discussed if necessary: see e.g. [consent agendas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent#Consent_Agenda).

This is not a strong opinion. I just made up a list by quickly looking at `dir()`. Concerning the two names you mention:

- what is `alarm` useful for for a Sage user that does not know how to import it?
- `column_matrix` is accessible via `matrix.column` and I believe it is easier (if properly advertised) to use the second version

Removing from the global namespace is different from removing.

In what way is the global namespace "confusing"? Is it hard for python to find the bindings? (no because python dictionaries should basically have access time independent of the size of the dictionary)

Is the problem that browsing the global namespace gives too long a list? It may just be the case that browsing the global namespace is not such a great strategy to learn about a computer algebra system.

Indeed, nobody cares about this.

I agree that methods like:

- `all_max_clique`, `clique_number`, `max_clique` should be methods of `Graph` only.

Questions: 
- how to know where a method is defined ? For instance, when typing `random_DAG?` I don't get the source file of the method but of `LazyImport`.
- Is there an easy way to know where a method is used ? I'm usually relying on grep which might not be the smartest way.

I almost exclusively use sage through the emacs interface (in fact, I don't even really know the ipython interface), and having a cleaner top level namespace might be quite helpful there.  I have, apart from aesthetics, two reasons:

* the list of suggestions becomes shorter, so when looking for something, I have less to read or search through, and thus better chances not to miss the needle in the haystack,

* tab completion has a better chance of working, that is, I have fewer characters to type to get completion.

However, I must say that things are not terribly bad currently.  So in case of doubt, I'd leave a particular item in the global name space.

I think `alarm()` is useful for general users, so long as we advertise it.  I actually thought that it did come up in some of the user documentation, though it appears not.  It is, however, used in a number of doctests.

`alarm()` is an easy way for a user to set a timeout for a long-running computation without having to manually Ctrl-C, and can even be more responsive.  For example:


```
sage: try:
....:     alarm(5)
....:     print('computing some optimization that might diverge...')
....:     import time; time.sleep(10)
....:     print('done')
....: except AlarmInterrupt:
....:     print('calculation took too long')
....:     
....:     
computing some optimization that might diverge...
calculation took too long
```


(as an aside, there is currently a bug when using a bare `alarm()` call in the IPython REPL without explictly catching the `AlarmInterrupt`, but it works fine as in the example above.  I thought I had an issue opened for that but I can't seem to find it...

What about developer-specific commands? When I look at `misc.all`, I see (among others):

- `benchmark`, `Profiler`, `logstr`, `cputime`, `walltime`, `set_edit_template`, the pickling stuff, `trace`, `fortran`?, everything from `sage.misc.package`

Other questionable commands from `misc.all`:

- `banner` (already mentioned above), `newton_method_sizes`, `map_threaded`

I don't actually know if any of these are useful. They're not useful to me, but I don't know how to judge whether they're useful enough to anyone else to keep in the global namespace.

I don't know why any of the pickling stuff is in the global namespace, but it has uses scattered throughout the Sage library, so some people view it as useful or important.
