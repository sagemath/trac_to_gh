# Issue 14327: Gurobi is not built anymore because of a typo !

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2013-05-04 22:36:20

Assignee: ncohen

Looks like the value of `SAGE_INC` used to end with a '/', and that changed. As a result the Gurobi backend is not built anymore !

And the winner is:

#14393 ("Clean up module_list.py to enforce and normalize the use of SAGE_INC over" )


```diff
diff --git a/module_list.py b/module_list.py
--- a/module_list.py
+++ b/module_list.py
`@``@` -6,8 +6,6 `@``@`
 from sage.env import *
 
 SAGE_INC = os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, 'include')
-# this is needed until someone fixes the usage of SAGE_INC in this file
-SAGE_INC += '/'

Well, at least gurobi was the only one missing. Of course it could only have happened to optional spkg !

Thanks for the review ! `:-)`

Never mind.  Just one more indication we should test optional spkgs more regularly, e.g. when a release candidate gets out.
