Dear developers. 

I am working on the log-normal model of Bacry et.al and I was looking at your function. 

At line 317 here : https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/finance/fractal.pyx

you att a term to the ACV if ell*i > T. However if I am not wrong on the paper of Bacry you have to add a term up to T : ell*i <= T. 

Best regards, 
SC
