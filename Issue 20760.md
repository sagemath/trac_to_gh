Keywords: Matrix-F5 algorithm, Gröbner bases, tropical Gröbner bases, p-adic computation

This ticket provides a first toy implementation of the Matrix-F5 algorithm to compute Gröbner bases.

Many variants of this algorithm are available:
* The classical one (see https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00974810).
* An adaptation for more stable computation of p-adic Gröbner bases (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5464).
* Various adaptations to the computation of tropical Gröbner bases (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6675).

Doctests are provided.

Hello, and welcome !

Could you provide a git branch for your code ? some intructions are here: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html

About the documentation: you need to indent the examples as follows:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: 1+1 == 2
    True
```

with 4 spaces.

And also both INPUT: and OUTPUT: must be followed by a blank line.

* do not use <> but !=
* use python3 syntax for print (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-compatible%20code)
* remove commented print lines
* There are some tests of `if len(something)>0` that could be replaced by `if something`
* missing first line : `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`
* The documentation of a function should start by a one-line description, then an empty line, then the rest of the doc.
* every function must be doctested, but `def sym_pol(n):` is not
