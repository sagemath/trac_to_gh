# Issue 33033: Difference between a formula and an image in ​Contour Plots

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33270

Original creator: @umedoblock

Original creation time: 2022-02-01 19:04:32

I tried to run some EXAMPLEs in [Contour Plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/contour_plot.html)

## environment

```
macOS Monterey
Version 12.1
```



```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

# example in [Contour Plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/contour_plot.html)

# tiny mistake(minus or plus)
## made

```
sage: f(x, y)=x^2-y^2
 BAD             ^
```

![](ticket:1:x.png)

## correct

```
sage: f(x, y)=x^2+y^2
  OK             ^
```

Ok, this is an error in the documentation code indeed. Are you planning to work on it?

It works under codes.

```
sage: f(x, y)=x^2+y^2                                                           
sage: contour_plot(f, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3), colorbar=True)                        
```

Changing priority from major to minor.

Yes, the image in the documentation is generated by a hidden line of code. You can see the sign error [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/439907fd9a15f7abff7b000e9845806099a6d329/src/sage/plot/contour_plot.py#L675-L684).

Changing keywords from "" to "beginner".

Changing component from graphics to documentation.

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2022-02-02 19:07:31

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

Thanks gh-mwageringel.

I have no idea about a hidden line of code.

It's auto generated.

And I'm not planning to work on it.
