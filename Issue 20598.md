I made some changes to this ticket:

- I simplified the output message of `_repr_` and `_latex_`. I also noticed other encoders in `linear_code.py` were outputting `Encoder blah for the Code blah`, while Sage convention is to write `Encoder blah for Code blah`. I fixed this as well.

- I renamed `rank_profile_column_indices` into `systematic_positions`, and utterly simplified its implementation.

- I also added details on the encoding, and what we call "systematic form" to the class docstring.

This is still open for review.

As this ticket introduces a new generic encoder, I merged in #20840 and made the appropriate changes.
It now depends on #20840 and is still open for review (and I'm done pushing changes now `;)`)

As `LinearCodeParityCheckEncoder` and `LinearCodeSystematicEncoder` were actually doing the same thing, I modified the latter so it now uses a parity check matrix when computing a generator matrix if it is the default encoder. I also deprecated the former.
I also merged in latest version of #20840 and fixed conflicts.

This is open for review.

In `AbstractLinearCode.generator_matrix_systematic`, shouldn't the method call `AbstractLinearCode.encoder` in order to use a possible cached systematic encoder?

Also, perhaps this ticket is as good a place as any to rename that method into `systematic_generator_matrix` and deprecate the old name.

Best,
Johan

Good job with the patch. I made a few improvements to the doc. I also added a
check to avoid infinite recursion in case the user made a class with the systematic encoder as default encoder but forgot to override parity check matrix.

If you can accept my changes, please set the ticket to positive review.
Best,
Johan
