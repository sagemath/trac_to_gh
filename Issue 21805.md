Does this change just disable the animation? 
I'd have expected something on the Python end of it too.

I mean, `animate` is set to `false` and remains so, and several pieces in the code
are conditional on its value. I'd imagine that it ought to be under the user control whether to animate or not. What is the point, can't you just remove these that are only executed for `animate==true`, and make the rest unconditional? 

I also really do not understand how the examples touched by this change are relevant for Sage. OK, these are examples how to render something in javascript. So?
