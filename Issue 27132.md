# Issue 27132: LaurentPolynomialRing over non-integral domains

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27369

It would be nice if the following worked as expected:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(Zmod(9))
...
ValueError: base ring must be an integral domain
```


This does work with `PolynomialRing` instead of `LaurentPolynomialRing`.
