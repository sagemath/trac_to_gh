# Issue 16211: Genus 1 Jacobi forms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mraum

Original creation time: 2014-06-05 16:44:23

Implement Jacobi forms with lattice index as in [Raum, Computing Genus 1 Jacobi Forms]. This is related to #15758, but does not depend on it. This allows to also compute vector valued modular forms for Weyl representations attached to discriminant forms.

There is one failing doctest

```
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/jacobi/higherrank_dimension.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/modular/jacobi/higherrank_dimension.py", line 61, in sage.modular.jacobi.higherrank_dimension.jacobi_dimension
Failed example:
    assert all( len(_classical_jacobi_forms_as_weak_jacobi_forms(k, m)) == jacobi_dimension(k, matrix([This is the Trac macro *2 * m* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#2 * m-macro))) for k in range(8, 16) for m in range(1, 10) ) 
```

I have made a commit that includes the doc into sage standard doc (I had to correct a sphinx error)
