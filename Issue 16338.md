Typos: `N_no_V` should be `N_to_V`, though I guess it's never used.  In the documentation of `_simple_model`, "Let `a` be a generator of `M/L` and let `a` be a generator of `L/K(x)`" shouldn't both be `a`s.  Otherwise, it looks good once doctests pass.

Sorry. It seems that I merged the wrong branch into this. I went back to the version that had the positive review.
