I am guessing that ideally we want to use the variable `MAXIMA` rather than those `maxima` and `maxima-sage` from the patch. It could be interesting as I could replace 

```
	# run maxima with ecl
	sed -i "s:'maxima :'maxima -l ecl :g" \
		sage/interfaces/maxima.py \
		sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py
```

with a variable assignment in sage-on-gentoo.

`maxima.py` is already using `MAXIMA` that leaves us with touching `maxima_abstract.py` and a couple of things to help sage-on-debian pass its doctests out of the box.

Not sure how to proceed with `bin/sage` as it is not reading that configuration file, nor should it.

OK, that's another issue, I don't like how sage-config is installed as a separate package but this is kind of orthogonal.
