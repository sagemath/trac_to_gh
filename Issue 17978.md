Before

```
sage: L.<a> = QuadraticField(-7)
sage: b = a - 13/7
sage: timeit("hash(b)")
625 loops, best of 3: 54 Âµs per loop
```

After

```
sage: L.<a> = QuadraticField(-7)
sage: b = a - 13/7
sage: timeit("hash(b)")
625 loops, best of 3: 97.7 ns per loop
```

... looks like a x500 speed up :-)

No idea. But it make sense. It was the previous implementation. I did not want to break anything.

On the other hand, it does not take the parent into account and 'sqrt(2) + 3/2' and 'sqrt(3) + 3/2' would have the same hash.

What do you think?

Hello,

Can you tell where this `42082631` comes from? Also, is it true that `mpz_pythonhash(self.b)` is zero when `self.b` is 0 ? It must hold if you want the hash of this element and the hash defined on Q to match.

This is to avoid conflicts for small values of `a` and `b`. It avoids conflicts between `a=1, b=-1` and `a=b=0`.

Yes. This is the same algorithm as Python hash for `int/long`.
