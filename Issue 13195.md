Typo: semidrirect instead of semidirect.

Another minor nitpick: Please don't add empty lines at the end of docstring or at the beginning of the function body. Python style is to use empty lines as sparingly as possible (see PEP8).

Typo and doctest corrected in the review patch.

There remains to add doctest for the nonImplemented Method.

Sorry for forgetting about this patch. It appears that doctests have been added for both nonImplemented methods. Is it now up to me to determine if this patch should receive a positive review?

I've been lurking on this ticket for a while so I figured I could put in some effort :) It looks good now, positive review.

The reviewer patch needs a proper commit message.

oops, sorry. Here is the new review patch, with added commit message

You should *replace* the commit message, not add to it. I.e. remove the second line

```
[mq]: trac_13367_review_fc.patch
```

Jeroen, did you merge the first patch only ?

Maybe you mean that you have merged both this patch and the review patch ? Then it would be ok, of course..

Yes, both are merged.
