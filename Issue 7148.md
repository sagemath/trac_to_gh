# Issue 7148: [with patch, needs review] tutorial: try to clarify the 'rings' section

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7148

The section in the tutorial on rings can be confusing to people who aren't familiar with them, and since this precedes the material on matrices (for example), people wanting to know how to solve linear equations might be thrown off.  This patch attempts to remedy this, at least partially.

I had to update the patch to take care of a change from #7007.
