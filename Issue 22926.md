The `PowerSeriesRing_generic` is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, so we do not want to override the (very fast) `WithEqualityById.__eq__`. Annoying `LaurentSeriesRing_generic` is not and instead implements its own custom cache! This is now #23183 and then we can simply remove the `__cmp__` here like we will do for `PowerSeriesRing_generic`.
