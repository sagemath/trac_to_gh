The SymPy-->Sage interface is theoretically tested in SymPy's `sympy/external/tests/test_sage.py` but practically it does not happen in the SymPy repo even if the file is changed, because of Travis limitations (a Sage installation is needed). The file header states:

```
# Execute this test inside Sage, e.g. with:
# sage -python bin/test sympy/external/tests/test_sage.py
#
# This file can be tested by Sage itself by:
# sage -t sympy/external/tests/test_sage.py
# and if all tests pass, it should be copied (verbatim) to Sage, so that it is
# automatically doctested by Sage.  Note that this second method imports the
# version of SymPy in Sage, whereas the -python method imports the local version
# of SymPy (both use the local version of the tests, however).
```

In the present version the file fails two doctests so these should be fixed in SymPy. This ticket should then add the patch to the Sage SymPy install and change the SymPy install script to automatically copy the file into Sage's `tests/` directory.

Wait a minute, this testsuite is actually installed anyway in `site-packages/sympy`?

So instead of copying that file, why not run the standard doctester on it?

```
sage: from sympy.external.tests import test_sage
sage: import doctest
sage: doctest.testmod(test_sage)
```

This is using the standard Python doctest framework, so the tests should be written with `>>>` instead of `sage:` and the tests should be put in real docstrings. A string somewhere in the middle of a `.py` file isn't a docstring.

Yes, it is.

Probably not "full Sage", or do you? It is possible to add `$(SAGERUNTIME)` to `build/pkgs/sympy/dependencies` if you require Sage. But that is not "full Sage", just a minimal Sage.

In any case, the solution from [comment:6] is simpler.

The Sage doctest framework needs to determine whether to load the file to be doctested or not. If the file to be tested is part of a package (as opposed to a stand-alone script), then it is never loaded. If `--force-lib` is given, it is also not loaded.

In this case, `--force-lib` is not needed because the file `test_sage.py` is part of a package.
