I don't agree with `Untitled.ipynb`: that's just one possible filename of a Jupyter notebook. It only works if you make at most 1 notebook.

Jupyter auto-saves the notebook under `Untitled.ipynb` when you create the notebook, you cannot avoid it even if you don't want it. That makes is pretty annoying and prone to accidentally check it in. Are we ever going to intentionally check in Untitled.ipynb? If not then its better to ignore.
