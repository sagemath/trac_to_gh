# Issue 22931: is_irreducible can be implemented on the parent as _is_irreducible_univariate_polynomial

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Just like `.factor` can call `._factor_univariate_polynomial`, `.is_irreducible` should be able to call `._is_irreducible_univariate_polynomial`.

Looks good to me, and the patchbot checks out (both the coverage complaint and the doctests failures are phantoms).  See #23202 as a followup.
