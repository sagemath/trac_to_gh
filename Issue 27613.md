Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27850

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2019-05-19 12:13:25

Zero is not necessary here:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(2)); _.<Y> = K[]
sage: F.<y> = K.extension(Y)
sage: p, = F.places_infinite()
sage: p.prime_ideal().gens_two()
(1/x, 0)
```
