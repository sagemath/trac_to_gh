Currently, if a `Feature` is keyed to an `spkg`, a `FeatureNotPresentError` recommends to use `sage -i` to install the package.

When `SAGE_ROOT` (or `sage_bootstrap`) is available, we can do better: We can recommend equivalent system packages.

IMHO it's better to put "noise" here - you can edit later on - than on a list with a much larger readership.

Anyhow, changing Python needs a big rebuild (of everything depending on Python), so the error looks unsurprising.

Many docstrings are starting with `"""` instead of `r"""`. Maybe that's the issue?

I did few tests, I get:

```
sage: from sage.features import package_systems
sage: package_systems()
[Feature('debian'), Feature('sage_spkg'), Feature('pip')]
```


So this looks good:

```
sage: from sage.features import PackageSystem
sage: PackageSystem('condaa').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('condaa', False)
sage: PackageSystem('conda').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('conda', False)
sage: PackageSystem('debian').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('debian', True)
```


It seems one needs to avoid `PackageSystem('sage_spkg')`:


```
sage: from sage.features import SagePackageSystem
sage: A = PackageSystem('sage_spkg')
sage: B = SagePackageSystem()
sage: A
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: B
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: A.is_present()        # expecting True
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', False)
sage: B.is_present()
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', True)
```


Similarly, 

```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').is_present()   # I was expecting True here
FeatureTestResult('pip', False)
```


The following looks good:


```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: from sage.features import PipPackageSystem
sage: PipPackageSystem().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('pip', True)
sage: PipPackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: SagePackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:\n  !sage -i jupyterlab'
```


The following does not look good (or maybe it is?):


```
sage: PackageSystem('debian').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'No equivalent system packages for debian are known to Sage.'
```

I didn't implement delegation to the correct class by name -- note that also `Feature` does not do that even though the default repr seems to suggest unique representation behavior of this kind:
