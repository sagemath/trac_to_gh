The various Cython files (`.pyx`, `.pxd`, `.pxi`) from the Sage library should be *installed* in `site-packages`. In fact, we already do this for `.pxd` and `.pxi` files.

Tickets #21480 and #24681 discuss reasons why we should do that: it allows displaying the traceback of Cython source files without accessing `SAGE_SRC`, which is a good thing for distributions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24690

Actually I'm not sure that's exactly it.  I think that what's happening is that any patchbots that tested this ticket now have the `.pyx` files installed into their `site-packages`, but when they switch branches again to test older tickets, it's not deleting those `.pyx` files (after all, the old branches don't know what they should be there in the first place) so those patchbots are failing.

I suppose there's not much we can do about that other than be aware of the problem, and eventually it will normalize...
