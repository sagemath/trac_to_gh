# Issue 17592: Discrepancy between sage -bdist and sage-bdist

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: Snark

Original creation time: 2015-02-22 16:35:38

I used to make a bdist by typing "./sage -bdist VER", which is still how it's documented. But in fact, that line ends up calling the sage-bdist script, whose argument isn't a version, but the name of a temporary directory!

The two scripts don't agree with one another ; I'll propose a patch when I find the time.

Uh... why is that bug still in needs_review?! Apparently the commit is already in 6.6.beta3, and git blame says it's my fault :-P

Please close that bug as fixed, thanks!
