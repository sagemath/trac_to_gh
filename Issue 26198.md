# Issue 26198: polytopes.simplex: Add base_ring keyword, allow exact computation with project=True

This enables setting up a regular simplex with `project=True` in algebraic reals

```
            sage: s3 = polytopes.simplex(3, project=True, base_ring=AA)
            sage: s3.volume() == sqrt(3+1) / factorial(3)
            True
```

Why not just do

```diff
-    base_ring = kwds.pop('base_ring', None)
-    if base_ring is None:
-        base_ring = RDF
+    base_ring = kwds.pop('base_ring', RDF)
```

Otherwise LGTM.

`simplex` passes through base_ring=None and delegates default handling to `project_points` in this way.

Replying to [comment:4 mkoeppe]:

Ah, I see. Can you add a comment in the code explaining this so someone (like me) is not tempted to do the change I suggested in comment:3? Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
