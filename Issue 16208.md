load and attach are used without parentheses in src/doc/en/tutorial/programming.rst but current releases of sage seem to need them.

I didn't realize until now that the ticket was still set to "new". In the future, you should set the ticket to "needs review" so that someone can come by and have a look. If it stays at "new", then the usual assumption is that there are no patches waiting for review.

Wait for the next beta release. Once the release happens, you can upgrade Sage and check that the fix is in. To upgrade Sage, just do the following

```
$ git checkout --track origin/develop -b develop
$ ./sage -upgrade develop
```
You can check for beta releases at [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-release).

You can always check out your own branch, so it is not really in "no man's land".

```
$ git checkout origin/develop -b develop # if you don't already have it

```

That said, the beta releases of Sage come out roughly every two weeks. The last one came out on June 4, so we are in the middle of the period between two releases.
