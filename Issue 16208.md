# Issue 16208: load and attach need parentheses

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: sanvila

Original creation time: 2014-06-05 10:36:52

load and attach are used without parentheses in src/doc/en/tutorial/programming.rst but current releases of sage seem to need them.

Will attach a trivial patch to this trac report.

Hello `@`sanvilla, looks like this is your first patch! Welcome to the Sage development process. We have actually moved on to a git based workflow. Do you think you can provide a git based patch?

If you are interested in providing a git based patch, you can start from here: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/git_trac.html

_Edit_ Feel free to ask for help! You can either ask here or at [sage-devel google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel).

Yes, I can try. I already knew that there was a way to associate git branches and trac reports, but didn't know the way. Thanks a lot for the hint.

Hello `@`ppurka. I managed to upload the tiny change as a git branch. Hope this helps.

This is very good. I was searching the docs, and it seems there are several additional places where "load" and "attach" are used. Can you fix them too? The list is here (based on sage-6.3.beta2). The output is in the form of `<filename>:<line number>:  <expression>`

```

Ok. Will do.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

I think that's all.

BTW: Now this trac report has two git commits, but I assume this documentation bug will be fixed by a single commit in sage master git. Is there a way I can merge those commits into a single one to ease the work of sage developers?

That's great! Many thanks. :-)

No, please don't try doing so. In this ticket it probably doesn't make much of a difference if we combine commits or not. In general, it is better to not combine them. Then we can follow the sequence of changes in the ticket.

The second reason for not combining the patches is that once you make something public, it is better not to change that. Someone else will have checked out your changes, and if you overwrite it then it will mess up their git.

I didn't realize until now that the ticket was still set to "new". In the future, you should set the ticket to "needs review" so that someone can come by and have a look. If it stays at "new", then the usual assumption is that there are no patches waiting for review.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Comment by ppurka created at 2014-06-06 16:11:48

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Thanks a lot.

Yes, I know that git commits should not be modified once they are distributed publically. I was thinking more about creating a new "final" git branch with a different name. Suppose it's not really something to worry about.

Following your hint, I've just set #15006 to "needs review" as well (this is a completely unrelated report, but I realized it should be easy to fix and posted a git branch there as well).

Resolution: fixed

How can I check that this is indeed fixed?

Wait for the next beta release. Once the release happens, you can upgrade Sage and check that the fix is in. To upgrade Sage, just do the following

```
$ git checkout --track origin/develop -b develop
$ ./sage -upgrade develop
```

You can check for beta releases at [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-release).

In other words: I can't right now and the fix is in limbo (aka "no man's land").

I don't like this. In Debian we close bugs when a new upload is available in unstable.
I wish every open source / free software project would do the same.

Comment by ppurka created at 2014-06-10 13:19:38

You can always check out your own branch, so it is not really in "no man's land".

```
$ git checkout origin/develop -b develop # if you don't already have it
$ git trac checkout 16445 # if you have git-trac-command installed
```


That said, the beta releases of Sage come out roughly every two weeks. The last one came out on June 4, so we are in the middle of the period between two releases.
