CC:  @jdemeyer @tscrim @fchapoton

This patch adds a dual function of `is_sectionally_complemented`.

Actually this is an example of a more verbose way to write `SEEALSO`-blocks.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22377

Somebody should test the function itself, even when the real reason is demonstrating seealso-block. Test code:


```
set_random_seed(42)
for i in range(100):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(randint(0, 30), 0.99)
    if L.is_cosectionally_complemented() != L.dual().is_sectionally_complemented():
        print("Bug 1")
        break
else:
    print("No bug 1")
for i in range(100):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(randint(0, 30), 0.99)
    a, b = L.is_cosectionally_complemented(certificate=True)
    if not a:
        L_ = LatticePoset(L.subposet(L.interval(b[0], L.top())))
        if L_.is_complemented():
            print("Bug 2")
            break            
else:
    print("No bug 2")
```

Travis, Frédéric: Comment on this more verbose seealso-block? Just to make sure before I go to make more changes.
