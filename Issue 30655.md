We implement Hessenberg algorithm (with choice of pivot) for computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix with coefficients in a complete discrete valuation ring/field.

A minor doc thing: In `hessenbergize_cdvf()`:

```diff
-NOTE::
+.. NOTE::
```

Also, is it guaranteed that `scalar` is in the correct parent? I am slightly worried about the `inv = ~pivot` going outside of the ring.

Thanks. It's fixed.

I think it is OK because the function `hessenbergize_cdvf` is only called with a matrix defined over a field. I added a sentence in the doctest to underline this point.

Once you push that last commit (seems like you only pushed the merge), then you can set a positive review.
