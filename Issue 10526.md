Original creator: wjp

Original creation time: 2011-01-10 03:37:38

Assignee: jason, was

`sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.echelon_form()` says


```
       .. note::

           The result is *not* cached.
```


However, the code has


```
        key = 'hnf-%s-%s'%(include_zero_rows,transformation)
        ans = self.fetch(key)
        if ans is not None: return ans
```
