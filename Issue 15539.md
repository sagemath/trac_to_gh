# Issue 15539: Fix formatting for tick marks that are latexed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15776

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-02-02 02:35:23

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3479/).


```
plot(1-4*x^2,.49999,.50001,tick_formatter=.00001.n(digits=7))
```

triggers the "if getting something in SR for a formatter then make sure both LaTeX" branch of the `Graphics.matplotlib` code and somehow that breaks with errors like

```

ValueError: 
\text{\texttt{{-}8e{-}05}}
^
Unknown symbol: \ttext (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
```

so that mpl, in trying to typeset `-8e^-5` somehow decides to prepend yet another text thing on it.
