CC:  @tscrim

Keywords: Laurent polynomials

A bit of unfinished business from #29512:

```
sage: P.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 1)
sage: u = x - 1
sage: v = u.toric_substitute((-1,), (-1,), 1)
sage: v
0
sage: v.is_zero()
False
```

The issue can be seen here:

```
sage: v.dict() # Should be empty, but isn't
{(0,): 0}
```
