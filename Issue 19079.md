# Issue 19079: compute asymptotic expansion to some rational directly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19316

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-09-30 08:30:03

CC:  behackl cheuberg

Currently we have

```
sage: A.<y> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='y^ZZ', coefficient_ring=QQ)
sage: (y^2 + O(y))^(1/2)  # not tested
y + O(1)
```

It is not tested, since the current implementation rewrites it to `exp(log(...))` which is not possible in `A`. There is a workaround:

```
sage: B.<z> = AsymptoticRing(growth_group='z^QQ * log(z)^QQ', coefficient_ring=QQ)
sage: (z^2 + O(z))^(1/2)
z + O(1)
```


The aim of this ticket is to make such things possible directly.

Merged #20000 due to a merge conflict (both tickets introduce a new method at the same position of the file).

My comments on #19423 also apply here.

I reviewed your code, merged latest version of #19423 and adapted to use `main_term_relative_error`. This now needs review.

LGTM, merged in #19423 again and removed two code lines (were already commented out), which were used for testing purposes.

I think that while merging the latest version of #19423, you inadvertently reverted commit [1b44d48](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=1b44d4819443cf28ef3811a11f5406494731b9c2) `Trac #19423: change ZeroDivisionError message`.
