In #30181, the class `ModuleElementWithMutability` was introduced. Unfortunately, this class is not compatible with the wrapper in `sage.structure.Mutability.require_mutable` and `sage.structure.Mutability.require_immutable` respectively due to different attribute names.

Furthermore, I suggest to improve the error message for the decorator in accordance to the method `_require_mutable`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31194

You would also need to change the corresponding attribute in `element.pxd`:

```diff

     cpdef bint is_immutable(self)

I had to adapt the doctest in `free_module_element.py`.

`simplicial_complex.py` had a small bug with the attribute treatment which I fixed.

So I don't think you should change the API for the `_v1` functions in the free module code. You should either create new `_v2` versions or just negate a bunch of the values. This will be better for backwards compatibility.

Other than that, the patchbot is happy.
