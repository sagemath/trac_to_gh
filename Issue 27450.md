As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

No, not yet. I still have to figure out a way to do the D<sub>4</sub><sup>(3)</sup> crystal. Although I am tempted to just cut it off, but I haven't found the time to think about it yet...
