# Issue 12636: Optimize ClassCallMetaClass using Cython

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12808

Original creator: hivert

Original creation time: 2012-04-04 15:23:29

Assignee: jason

CC:  nthiery simonking

Keywords: classcall UniqueRepresentation

When a class `C` is an instance of `ClasscallMetaclass`, then for any constructor call, the system currently looks for `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` in `C`. This adds quite an overhead and this could be cached, assuming no one modifies `C` (which seems reasonable). Improving this speeds up, in particular, all call to the constructor of a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, eg. many parents, all categories...

Before

```
sage: %timeit ZZ in Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 1.13 µs per loop
```

After the preliminary patch

```
sage: %timeit ZZ in Rings()
625 loops, best of 3: 448 ns per loops
```

I'm finishing the patch, I've added a large optimization for the other branch
where there is no `__classcall__`

Here are the results in the basis case (no `__classcall__`)::

```
sage: class Rien(object):
...       pass
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
sage: class NOCALL(object):
...      __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
...      pass

Standard Python class:

sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.7 ms per loop

Currently:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 15.9 ms per loop

Cython version:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 3.59 ms per loop

Cython optimized version:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.76 ms per loop
```

So I'm 5% only slower than normal class.

Here are the results in the basis case (no `__classcall__`)::

```
sage: class CALL(object):
...       __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
...       @staticmethod
...       def __classcall_private__(cls, arg):
...           arg = arg + arg
...           return arg

Currently:

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 8.7 ms per loop

Cython version:

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.33 ms per loop

Cython optimized version (no mesurable difference from the preceding):

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
```

Here I'm twice as fast as before.

I'm cleanup the patch (doctests) an will post it shortly.

Sorry, I can not do any serious work (reviewing), as I am in the middle of holidays. But it looks promising!

Hi Florent!

I know the patch is preliminary, but here are two comments:

In the new file classcall_metaclass_cy.pyx, it is not explained what `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` do, and when to implement which. Actually, I have never used `__classcall_private__` myself.

In the old python version of classcall_metaclass, you move `__call__` to `__call__disable`. Why do you not completely remove the slow Python call method?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-20 07:18:53

Also, why not going all the way and remove the python version completely? Or at least: Why not cythonizing (and caching?) the `__contains__` method?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-20 07:55:16

Or ideally, one could try to provide a generalised metaclass framework in Sage. Namely, one could think of having different small metaclasses, each providing a particular feature. For example:

 * We have `NestedMetaclass`.
 * We already have `__classcall__` (perhaps resulting in a unique parent structure or in a dynamic class).
 * At #11794, I suggest a metaclass that provides a fast cached hash.
 * Just "brainstorming": Perhaps it would be a useful feature for debugging to print which Python methods are called of a particular instance. I could imagine a metaclass that could be used to _temporarily_ switch that feature on.

And if we have different "small" metaclasses then it would be useful to combine them. But that's a problem for Python: If A, B and C have different metaclasses, you can not simply have a class definition like

```
    class D(A,B,C): pass
```


This is (I guess) why `ClasscallMetaclass` inherits from `NestedMetaclass`. But Ticket #11794 provides examples for a different and more skalable solution: _Make metaclasses dynamic!_

So, what I mean by a generalised metaclass framework in Sage is:
 * Implement a base class `SageMetaclass`, from which all metaclasses (such as `NestedMetaclass` and `ClasscallMetaclass` and `FastHashMetaclass`) are derived.
 * Make it so that if A, B, C are classes with different metaclasses (all derived from `SageMetaclass`) can be used as base classes for a new class. In that way, the features provided by metaclasses could be freely combined.

But I guess that's a topic for a different ticket...


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-20 08:06:47

PS: If that works, one could also get rid of the `DynamicClasscallMetaclass`, which seems like a hack that became necessary since one can not freely combine base classes with different metaclasses.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for all those remarks and sorry for not having finished this one as fast as I wanted.

Replying to [comment:5 SimonKing]:

Obviously. Please see my patch on sage combinat's queue which already adresses all those remarks. I'm currently doing intensive timing to be sure that we have the fastest way.

Yes it is. We discussed last week with Nicolas of switching the inheritance
order here. That is using only `NestedMetaclass` for Categories. I still have
to check that this doesn't break pickling of Parent with a nested Element.

+1 for this and for keeping it for a different ticket.

Hi Simon,

I just uploaded an updated patch. I still have to lauch the tests (but I've to run for a train now) and to check the documentation. The code together with the timings should hopefully be the final version here.
I'll put the needs review after the tests and doc rereading.

Thanks for your remarks.

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 08:46:24

Could it be that the patch was created by something like "hg remove sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.py" followed by "hg add sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.pyx"?

I am no mercurial expert, but I was told that one should better use "hg rename sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.py sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.pyx".


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 08:58:04

While we are at it: Shouldn't we also try whether changing unique_representation.py into unique_representation.pyx yields a speedup (but not changing "class" into "cdef class", I guess that won't work)?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 09:16:39

I have created an alternative patch (using hg rename). It is smaller than the original patch, but should result in identical code. So, either of the patches could be used, but I guess the smaller patch is easier to read (because one sees more easily the additional differences between classcall_metaclass.py and classcall_metaclass.pyx)

Apply trac_12808-classcall_speedup2.patch


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 12:25:04

Good news: All doctests pass.

I am astonished that the C-level way of calling `type.__call__` is so much faster. That suggests to cythonise sage.structure.dynamic_class as well, so that dynamic classes are created more quickly! Shall this be done on a different ticket?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 18:08:11

Probably the dynamic class cythonisation should be on a different ticket. However, it seems that the change to cython will not be so difficult: I simply renamed dynamic_class.py into dynamic_class.pyx (and added two lines to module_list.py), and the test suite seems to pass (most of it is already finished). And then, one can apply your trick with `type.__call__`.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-22 19:04:50

I see that you added `_included_private_doc_`. Could you elaborate on it? I just searched the sources for that name, but it does not occur anywhere except in your patch. So, what does it do?

Thanks for trying this out! It's cool that it works.

Now, do you mind postponing to a later ticket after #11935? I am doing a couple small changes to dynamic_class in my upcoming reviewer's patch (hopefuly tomorrow).

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-23 09:40:32

Note that there is a conflict with #12215, so, either of the patches needs to be rebased. But I guess we first see what patch will be reviewed first...

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-23 09:55:01

Some further questions (in addition to my question about the rôle of _included_private_doc_):

Why is `__all__ = ['ClasscallType', 'ClasscallMetaclass', 'typecall', 'timeCall']` added? Isn't importing also possible without that? Or is it needed to make `from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import *` work?

Why is there a two-step cythonisation? I mean, why is there a cdef class `ClasscallType` implementing the special methods, and then `ClasscallMetaclass` defined by double inheritance from `ClasscallType` and `NestedClassMetaclass`? Wouldn't it be better/easier/faster to cdef `NestedClassMetaclass` as well, and then cdef `ClasscallMetaclass` directly, without having the `ClasscallType`?

I guess the typecall function will be useful in other modules (e.g., when cythonising dynamic_class). But it only is def. Shouldn't it rather be `cdef inline`?

Concerning the timing tools provided in the module: Is there still no "central" location for all aspects of timing? I thought there were occasional discussions on sage-devel about a benchmark/timing framework.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for your in depth review.

> Some further questions (in addition to my question about the rôle of _included_private_doc_):

This is a tentative inclusion of the doc of the special methods (see
[this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b1cf6b2243bba673?hl=en) on sage devel.

> Why is `__all__ = ['ClasscallType', 'ClasscallMetaclass', 'typecall', 'timeCall']` added? Isn't importing also possible without that? Or is it needed to make `from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import *` work?

I just want to hide the few class I wrote here for timing (CRef, C2, C3,
C2C). With this line, they are neither imported with import *, nor documented.

There is this discussion about cleaning up the way metaclass are defined and
used in Sage. I just wanted to keep features separate. Should we decide to
merge or rewrite the metaclass architecture, I'd rather to keep this for a
different ticket.

You mean `cpdef inline` (we may want to call it from Python) ? I had the
impression from C that this inline doesn't do anything if the function is
defined in a different module. More precisely, in C/C++ inline only work if
the function is defined in `.h` instead of `.c`. Does Cython do
anything for that ?

Not that I know of.

I forgot: thanks for creating a new patch. I didn't use rename because at some point of my experiment, I was having the two files `*.py` and `*_c.pyx` with the `*.py` importing the other. Then I copied the documentation from `*.py` to `*_c.pyx` until the `*.py` becomes nearly empty. At the end, I renamed the `*_c.pyx` into the `*.pyx` and removed the `*.py`. 

How did you manage to get a patch using rename at the end ?

So, it is not for making something importable, but for _excluding_ something from automatic import? Cool!

You mean the [sage-combinat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/ae09de5a608525e5) thread I started?

> I just wanted to keep features separate.

Well, I actually think cythoning `NestedClassMetaclass` is _less_ intrusive than your patch.

Compare: You have to _add_ a new cdef class `ClasscallType` and change the inheritance of `ClasscallMetaclass`. I suggest to change `NestedClassMetaclass` into a cdef class, keep the inheritance of `ClasscallMetaclass`, and avoid the addition of `ClasscallType`.

I think I will test it...

> You mean `cpdef inline` (we may want to call it from Python) ?

Yes, I forgot the letter "p".

I expected it to be inlined, if it is defined cpdef inline in the pxd file, and then cimported into another cython file. But I don't know if that is really done, actually.

Manually. Namely: Apply your patch, copy the touched/new files to a temporary directory, remove your patch, `hg qnew`, then `hg rename`, then move the copy of your file over to the file that has just been created by `hg rename`, and then `hg qrefresh`.

Except that at some point Nicolas suggested to keep NestedClassMetaclass for
Categories... The truth is that I've currently no idea on the good way
metaclass should be organized in Sage. So I tried to avoid any interface
changes. I was even surprised that the Cythonizing work so well without
breaking anything in Sage. Now If you think there is a better/faster
way. Please give it a try.

I'll look at the compiled result.

Oups ! Sorry I forgot to click "submit changes". Simon, your patch is broken. It is missing `classcall_metaclass.pxd` and as a consequence make Sage segfault as startup. I just added the file compared to your patch.

Aha! So, I forgot `hg add` at some point.

It is relatively easy to change nested_class.py into nested_class.pyx (though not totally trivial). But I was not able to change `NestedClassMetaclass` into a cdef class.

Apparently, the problem is that during initialisation of a cdef class (derived from type, at least) the name and the module of that class are not known yet. Hence, a crash in nested_pickle, which is called during initialisation. However, if one determines name and module in a different way and passes it directly to nested_pickle, then there is a different crash, and here I don't understand what is wrong, yet.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-24 07:30:02

I notice that the crash seems to be related with importing the nested class examples in the nested_class module. Perhaps one needs to avoid any application of nested classes in the nested_class module, and move the examples to a different module?

Nope, doesn't work.

So, currently, it seems (easily) possible to change nested_class.py into nested_class.pyx (even so that all tests pass), but impossible to change `class NestedClassMetaclass` into `cdef class NestedClassMetaclass`. Hence, probably your approach is the way to go: Introduce a new cdef class, implement fast cython methods there, and then let `ClasscallMetaclass` double inherit from the new cdef class and from `NestedClassMetaclass`.

I still think that a meta-metaclass could do the same job automatically (namely: We implement various cdef classes, and the meta-metaclass combines them and turns them into a metaclass). But that is clearly a different topic.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-24 10:19:52

It seems that indeed it is impossible to use a cdef class as metaclass - see the example that I gave at [cython-users](http://groups.google.com/group/cython-users/browse_thread/thread/f1f7f004ee06aaad).

Hence, I guess your indirect solution (namely to define fast methods in a cdef class `ClasscallType` and then derive from it a usual Python class `ClasscallMetaclass`) is probably the only feasible.

Indeed! It seems that changing `NestedClassMetaclass` into a cdef class with the help of your trick works fine.

By the way, the `__init__` of nested classes does nothing more than calling `nested_pickle`, but this does nothing more than to call `modify_for_nested_pickle`. That should thus be simplified, and perhaps even cpdef'd!

Also, when `nested_pickle` calls `modify_for_nested_pickle`, it always looks up `sys.modules[...]` - thus, why not store `sys.modules` in a `cdef dict` variable?!

I only touched the nested classes, not `ClasscallMetaclass`, and the test suite isn't completed yet, but most seems to pass.

What next? As I have pointed out, it seems more straight forward to cdef both `NestedClassMetaclass` and its subclass `ClasscallMetaclass` directly, not via an additional `ClasscallType`. How should it be organised?

Variant 1: I produce a patch that does the changes in nested_class, and includes most of the changes from your patch (but not `ClasscallType`). Then I post it here, and we cross-review.

Variant 2: I review your patch from here, and do my changes (which would revert your changes in the bases of `ClasscallMetaclass`) on a different ticket.

What do you prefer?

Hi Simon,

Does this give a large speed-up ? I would guess that the dict search is the
bottleneck, but without serious profiling one cannot be sure.

Sure ! ClasscallType was for me a step before doing more in depth change in
the Metaclass infrastructure. I was quite scared to do those in depth change
in Sage/Python and feared a lot of hard to debug segfaults. So I did the check
by very small steps changing the less possible Sage files. Fortunately, it
went quite smooth. I planned to keep the rest of the metaclass infrastructure
for another patch but if you think you cdefing NestedClassMetaclass is easily
done, we can do both at once an thus the need of ClasscallType vanishes.

As you wish ! I most probably wont be working on that ticket anymore, unless
for addressing some reviewer remark or to help you if you need. The two
variants are equal to me and you can consider yourself the owner of that
ticker if you wish. We just need to have some clean review. So if you go for
variant 2, I think you first need to positive review my change, and then
revamp them and I will review you additions.

So please shoot as you prefer ;-)

Let's test:

```


Conclusion: Assigning `sys.modules` to a Python variable brings a speed-up of 1/3, and assigning it to a Cython variable brings a speed-up of 5/6. So, the speed-up obtained from Cython is indeed huge.

Yes, it is easily done - *if* one knows what to cimport. How did you find out?

"Easy" means that one can really just change def into cdef. And in addition to that, I tried to call some frequently used routine directly, in order to avoid a calling overhead, and also I cpdefined that routine.

My preference is to do it on one ticket (the common topic being "cdefine `ClasscallMetaclass`", which of course also involves cdefining `NestedClassMetaclass`).

Concerning clean review: I would provide a patch that is to be applied before your patch (dealing with nested classes) and another one to be applied after your patch (refactoring the bases of classcall metaclass).

Hence, we can easily cross-review, which is considered to be "clean".

Cool ! So my intuition where wrong. This is something I don't feel very
comfortable with Python. When I try to predict which part of the code should
be optimized I'm too often wrong. I remember being much better at that in
MuPAD. I have the impression that Python is not very predictable, but maybe
it's just me. I guess I need to optimize more code.

They is an example (writen by Robert I think) in Parent. Googling "Cython
subclassing builtin" gives some good examples:

- http://wiki.cython.org/FAQ/cdef_derive
- http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/extension_types.html#external-extension-types
- http://www.mail-archive.com/cython-dev`@`codespeak.net/msg04857.html

I guess I was lucky too !

No weird segfault and hardcore debugging. This is easy enough ! Cool !

Excellent. I'm waiting for your input. I'll have time to review it at Sage
Days 38 if not before.

We suggested the following approaches towards getting fast metaclasses.

 * You suggested: "Let a metaclass be a Python class that gets fast methods from a Cython class"
 * I suggested: "Implement the metaclass directly in Cython" (you showed how it works)

Here, I study the question whether we should expect a significant speed difference in the two approaches.

Let the following be put in a pyx file that we attach to a Sage session:

```
cdef class T1:
    def __call__(self, x):
        return x

cdef class T2:
    def __hash__(self):
        return 123

cdef class T3:
    def __add__(self, x):
        return self

cdef class T4:
    def test(self, x):
        return x
```


Hence, we have Cython classes, the first three of them providing typical "magical" methods, the fourth a custom method. In the Sage session, we derive a Python class from the four classes, and, to make it more "realistic", we give a second base.

```
sage: C1 = type("C1",(T1,Parent),{})
sage: C2 = type("C2",(T2,Parent),{})
sage: C3 = type("C3",(T3,Parent),{})
sage: C4 = type("C4",(T4,Parent),{})
```


C1,...,C4 correspond to metaclasses implemented as you suggest, T1,...,T4 as I suggest.

It could be that in future we want to have meta-metaclasses, which would allow to mix the metaclasses. Hence, I am also considering new classes derived from C1,...,C4 resp. from T1,...,T4:

```
sage: Cdirect = type("Cdirect",(T1,T2,T3,T4,Parent),{})
sage: Cindirect = type("Cindirect",(C1,C2,C3,C4),{})       
```

Let us create instances of each class:

```
sage: c1 = C1()
sage: c2 = C2()
sage: c3 = C3()
sage: c4 = C4()
sage: t1 = T1()
sage: t2 = T2() 
sage: t3 = T3()
sage: t4 = T4()
sage: ci = Cindirect()
sage: cd = Cdirect()  
```


Now for the timings. First, the call method:

```
sage: timeit("a = c1(3)", number=300000)    
300000 loops, best of 3: 280 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t1(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 277 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 279 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 278 ns per loop
```


Next, the hash:

```
sage: timeit("a = hash(c2)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 87.6 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(t2)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 85.9 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(ci)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 83.6 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(cd)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 99.7 ns per loop
```


Arithmetics:

```
sage: timeit("a = c3+c3", number=300000)   
300000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t3+t3", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 83 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci+ci", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 77.8 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd+cd", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 77.4 ns per loop
```


And a non-magical method:

```
sage: timeit("a = c4.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 327 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t4.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 285 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 444 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 364 ns per loop
```


Summary:

For the magical methods, there is no significant speed difference between our suggestions (with exception of addition, but that result looks strange, and I don't really believe it). This would even hold if (in future) we would consider to create metaclasses "dynamically" (i.e., in the same way as I have created `Cindirect` and `Cdirect` above).

It only pays off to _directly_ implement stuff in Cython, if non-magical methods are concerned. But I doubt that we want non-magical methods for metaclasses.

So, the decision between our suggestions must rely on different reasons: Which one is simpler and easier to maintain? The plus of my suggestion is that it is direct, i.e., there are less layers of indirection. The plus of your suggestion is that it works without creating an extension type for builtin types.

After a break, I will attach my two patches, and then the discussion can start...

Make ClasscallMetaclass an extension type of type


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-25 16:08:28

I have attached my two patches. Your patch and my patch actually turn out to be independent.

Purpose of my first patch: Make `NestedClassMetaclass` an extension type of type, and avoid some calling overhead during its creation.

Purpose of my second patch: Make `ClasscallMetclass` an extension type as well, directly derived from `NestedClassMetaclass`.

*__Timings__*

With *sage-5.1.notebook unpatched*, I get for Florent's examples

```
sage: class Rien(object):
....:     pass
....:
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
sage: class NOCALL(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     pass
....:
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.74 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 16.7 ms per loop
sage: class CALL(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def __classcall_private__(cls, arg):
....:         arg = arg + arg
....:         return arg
....:
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 9.05 ms per loop
```

Here is something with `__classcall__` instead of `__classcall_private__`, and in a way that has less overhead than `arg+arg`:

```
sage: class NewCall(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def __classcall__(cls, C):
....:         return C
....:
sage: C = ZZ.__class__
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 878 ns per loop
```

And finally a "nested class" example:

```
sage: from sage.misc.nested_class import NestedClassMetaclass
sage: def test_nest():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = NestedClassMetaclass
....:         class B:
....:             pass
....:
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 33.1 µs per loop
```


Now, the same examples with my first patch:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.76 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 18.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 10.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 µs per loop
```


Now, with your patch only:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.77 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 889 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 32.8 µs per loop
```


Thus, our patches treat orthogonal aspects. Now, the first two patches together:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.78 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 895 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 µs per loop
```


And with all three patches:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.75 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2.08 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.44 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 897 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 µs per loop
```


__CONCLUSION__

My first patch does improve the time spent for the creation of a nested class. Your patch improves a lot of things for classcall metaclass. My second patch makes (I think) the inheritance a bit clearer, but it does not provide a speed-up. The reason is explained in my previous post.

Hi Simon,

Thanks a lot for this in depth timing measurement !

Excellent !

I fully agree that it is clearer. There may be however some speed penalty with
getting rid of `ClasscallType` if we need at some point to construct a lot
of classes which need the classcall trick but without nested classes. I don't
know if this usecase is realistic at all. Do you have any idea on this
question ? I don't even know if the current dynamic class allows it. Anyway,
there won't be any overhead from the point of view of the instances creation
and, manipulation but there may be when creating the *classes*
themselves. Therefore I think we should measure the relative price of creating
*classes* which `ClasscallType` vs `ClasscallMetaclass`. I'll
investigate this while reviewing your patch.

So my current opinion is: we should do the timing while we can easily do
it. Then if nothing is measurable with the current Sage usage, but measurable
with some weird one, we should remove `ClasscallType` (any unused code and
moreover confusing code shouldn't remain) keeping somewhere a note saying that
if the weird usecase appear (which I don't really believe) we should separate
`ClasscallType` vs `ClasscallMetaclass`.

Cheers,

Florent

Dear Florent,

Replying to [comment:42 hivert]:

> of classes which need the classcall trick but without nested classes.

Well, the problem is as I have explained in the sage-combinat-devel thread. Some classes would actually not use more than the `__call__` method (so, morally, `ClasscallMetaclass` should only do this one thing), while some would only need nesting or another `__init__` (so, `NestedClassMetaclass` should only do this one thing), and others only need a custom `__reduce__` method (so, `DynamicMetaclass` should only to this one thing).

However, in typical applications, we want to construct a class that simultaneously derives from classes with different metaclasses. That is only possible if we have metaclasses that combine different features. Hence, `ClasscallMetaclass` inherits from `NestedClassMetaclass` (although it often does not need nesting), and there is an additional `DynamicClasscallMetaclass`, just to cope with dynamic classes that have a classcall.

I'd really like to have these combined metaclasses created automatically, hence, using a meta-metaclass.

Concerning time penalty: As I have demonstrated above, there is no time penalty for special methods of a class C that are inherited from different Cython classes - even if the inheritance is indirect. A speed penalty only seems to occur, if one has an _indirect_ inheritance of _non-magical_ methods.

Hence, if C is actually used as a metaclass, I would expect that both approaches (defining the fast magical methods in `ClasscallType` and other auxiliar types or directly in `ClasscallMetaclass` and other metaclasses) are equal, speed-wise.

> I don't
> know if this usecase is realistic at all.

See above: There _is_ need for combined metaclasses, even though in some applications a pure one-trick metaclass would be enough.

> Anyway,

Well, the timings that I presented were for a class C, and I measured some methods (e.g. `__call__`) of its instances. However, I think the same observations will hold if C actually is a _meta_class, and we would measure `__call__` etc. of its instances (which are classes).

But of course the time for creating (not just for calling) the instances matters as well.

Cheers,

Simon

Replying to [comment:43 SimonKing]:

In my previous posts, I have demonstrated that some "magical" methods are equally fast for a cdef class and for a python class that inherits from the cdef class. See `__call__`, `__hash__` and `__add__`. I only found a speed penalty for inherited non-magical methods.

However, the creation of instances is indeed A LOT faster for cdef classes than for Python classes. Recall the definition of T1, ..., T4, C1, ..., C4, Cdirect and Cindirect. We get

```
sage: timeit("a = T1()", number=300000)      
300000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = T2()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = T3()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = T4()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = C1()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 16.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a = C2()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 17 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a = C3()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 17.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a = C4()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 17 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a = Cdirect()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 18.8 µs per loop
sage: timeit("a = Cindirect()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 20.1 µs per loop
```


According to these timings, I would expect that the creation of classes with an actual cdef metaclass (as with my second patch) is faster than the creation of classes with a Python metaclass that inherits from a cdef class (like `ClasscallType`). Let's test:

```
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
....: def test_creation():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  
....:         @staticmethod
....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):
....:             return x
....: """)    
```


Without patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 41.7 µs per loop
```


With your patch only:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.8 µs per loop
```


With the first two patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 µs per loop
```


With all three patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000) 
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 µs per loop
```


And when cimporting the metaclass (which of course only works with all three patches):

```
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass cimport ClasscallMetaclass
....: def test_creation():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  
....:         @staticmethod
....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):
....:             return x
....: """)    
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.2 µs per loop
```


In other words: It seems that directly cdefining the metaclasses is not only clearer than the use of `ClasscallType`, but it is indeed a little (but not much) faster.

Comment by hivert created at 2012-04-26 12:40:52

Hi Simon,

Thanks again for those very precise timing measures. I'm sorry I wasn't
completely clear on the timing I wanted to have. Here is what I hope is a
clearer explanation:

There is a common usage of `ClasscallMetaclass` and
`__classcall_private__` for elements in order to delegate the creation to
the parent. For example, the call

```
sage: PerfectMatching([(1,2),(3,4)])
PerfectMatching [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```

actually create the parent:

```
sage: P4 = PerfectMatchings(4); P4
Set of perfect matchings of {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

And calls

```
sage: P4([(1,2),(3,4)])
PerfectMatching [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```

This is done by a classcall trick. There isn't currently a lot of this trick
in Sage library but many more are coming from the Sage-combinat queue.

Now I don't see any element class having a nested class. So in an ideal world,
we'd like to have `PerfectMatching` in `ClasscallMetaclass` but not in
`NestedClassMetaclass`. From your timings, I clearly see that being in
`NestedClassMetaclass` doesn't impact creation of the element, but I was
wondering how it impact the creation of the class `element_class`
itself. As I said, I don't currently see any usecase where we will create a
lot of `element_class` but who knows...

So here are the timings:

```
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallType
sage: from sage.structure.element import Element

sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 25.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 31 µs per loop
```

With your patch cdefing `NestedclassMetaclass`, there is a slight overhead
in being in `NestedClassMetaclass`:

```
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 36.9 µs per loop
```

The overhead is quite similar when `NestedclassMetaclass` is not cdef:

```
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 37.2 µs per loop
```

Now this case is not very realistic since there are no methods in the new
class. Let's put some by getting a realistic dictionary:

```
sage: dct = dict(PerfectMatching.__dict__)
sage: len(dct)
24
```

With a cdef `NestedclassMetaclass`

```
sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 27 µs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 31.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 48.9 µs per loop
```

Without a cdef `NestedclassMetaclass`

```
sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 28.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 32.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 50.6 µs per loop

As a conclusion in some realistic usecases: the slowdown for having
`ClasscallMetaclass` systematically inheriting from
`NestedclassMetaclass`, that is no `ClasscallType` is 48.9 µs vs 31.7
µs. This is non negligible (after all calling the
`modify_for_nested_pickle` indeed has a cost) but much less that I
expected. Since I see no realistic usage in creating a lot of such classes, I
think I'm Ok with your second patch. I'd like to have Nicolas opinion on that,
since he is the one that raised this question.

I'm reviewing your two patches (after having lunch).

Good example! That's exactly along the lines of the [sage-combinat thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/ae09de5a608525e5) I started: We have common use cases in which we want to combine the nested class feature with the classcall feature, and thus someone has decided to make classcall inherit from nested class, although there are examples in which this is not needed.

Instead, one could either create a pure classcall metaclass on the one hand, and a combined `ClasscallNestedClassMetaclass` on the other hand: This is similar to the `DynamicClasscallMetaclass`, which is a combined class for `DynamicMetaclass` and `ClasscallMetaclass`. Of course, having "pure" `ClasscallMetaclass`, `NestedClassMetaclass` and `DynamicMetaclass`, we would need to create four combined metaclasses to cover all potential use cases.

Or: We could have a meta-metaclass that creates the combined metaclasses automatically...

That said: I think we should focus here on making things faster while preserving the existing scheme. The meta-metaclass thingy (or the explicit creation of metaclasses that combine some "pure" metaclasses) should be done on a different ticket, if at all.

I forgot: Since your patch looks fine to me (independent on whether we eventually decide to cdef `ClasscallMetaclass` directly) and since all tests pass and the documentation looks fine, I give your part of the work a positive review.

Ok ! For your part I've a question: is there any reason why do you call
`sys_module` in `nested_pickle` whereas you call `sys.module` in
`NestedClassMetaclass.__init__` ?

Otherwise things looks good !

Thanks for spotting it! I have updated the nested_class patch.

Apply trac_12808-classcall_speedup-fh.patch trac_12808_nested_class_cython.patch trac_12808-classcall_cdef.patch

Then it's a positive review for me !

I also created #12886 as a followup.

Thanks Simon.

Sorry ! I forgot to remove Simon's question. It's decided.

There is a trivial conflict between this ticket and #12215 (in unique_representation.py). Which one should go first?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2012-04-30 10:47:38

I guess this one should go in first,: After all, #12215 has not been reviewed, yet.

Ok. May I let you handle the rebase?
