Keywords: tableaux, sage-combinat, mutability

Tableaux in Sage are mutable objects, at least indirectly:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1,2],[2]])
sage: t0 = T[0]
sage: t0[1] = 3 
sage: T
[[1, 3], [2]]
```

This in itself is probably not a bug, although not the kind of behavior I like either (what exactly is sped up by mutability of tableaux?). But there are things which probably are bugs given this behavior:

1. Tableaux are hashed by reference:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1,2],[2]])
sage: hash(T)
-7723024261707595164
sage: T[0][1] = 4
sage: hash(T)
-7723024261707595164
```


2. Line 311 of `sage/combinat/tableau.py` says:

```
            # Since we are (suppose to be) immutable, we can share the underlying data
```

But we are not immutable. This comment line is supposed to provide justification for initializing the tableau as a `CombinatorialObject`, but the docstring of `CombinatorialObject` says that "CombinatorialObjects are shallowly immutable, and the intention is that they are semantically immutable". The latter is not satisfied for tableaux.

If we want tableaux to be mutable, why wrap them inside such a class? If we want them to be immutable, wouldn't it be right to encode them as CombinatorialObjects of CombinatorialObjects? Or is the speed cost for this too steep? And, finally, what is it that CombinatorialObject does that tuple does not?

And, on a related note, does Sage provide a class for immutable dictionaries? (I'm still hell-bent on implementing arbitrary-shaped tableaux.)

3. Mutating tableaux poisons type judgments (or what passes for type judgments in Sage):

```
sage: T = StandardTableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: T[0][1] = 2
sage: isinstance(T, StandardTableau)
True
```


4. There is some action at a distance (although fortunately rare):

```
sage: T = SkewTableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: S = T.to_tableau()  # Tableau(S) doesn't work, wondering if it should?
sage: S
[[1, 2], [3]]
sage: T
[[1, 2], [3]]
sage: T[0][1] = 5
sage: S
[[1, 5], [3]]
sage: T
[[1, 5], [3]]
```


5. How would I define Loday's Hopf algebra of tableaux if tableaux are mutable?

This is definitely an issue. My first thought is to convert all of the sublists (rows) of the tableaux as tuples and upon calling `_repr_`, convert them back to lists. I'll think more about this today.

Any results? I'm also in favor in tuples. Do you think there will be a speed regression to this? It seems to me that we are not making any use of the deep mutability of tableaux, so I wouldn't expect that to happen.

Sorry, I let this one drop off my radar. Here's the block that we should look at IMO (lines 315-318 in `tableau.py`)

```python
# CombinatorialObject verifies that t is a list
# We must verify t is a list of lists
if not all(isinstance(row, list) for row in t):
    raise ValueError("A tableau must be a list of lists.")
```

The first part of the comment is bogus, `CombinatorialObject` verifies that `t` acts like a list:

```
sage: CombinatorialObject((1,2,3))
[1, 2, 3]
```

and from it's doc:

```
- ``l`` -- a list or any object that can be convert to a list by ``list``
```

The part we need to look it is should we just do something like `t = map(tuple, t)` for the tableau input and let that error out?

Overall, there will be speed regression in the printing of tableaux. Here's what I would do for the `_repr_()`:

```python
def _repr_(self):
    return repr(map(list, self._list))
```

and here are some sample timings:

```
sage: L = [(1,2)]*5
sage: %timeit repr(L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.5 us per loop
sage: %timeit repr(map(list, L))
10000 loops, best of 3: 17.2 us per loop
sage: L = [(1,2)]*20
sage: %timeit repr(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.7 us per loop
sage: %timeit repr(map(list, L))
10000 loops, best of 3: 62 us per loop
sage: L = [(1,2,3,4)]*100
sage: %timeit repr(L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 332 us per loop
sage: %timeit repr(map(list, L))
1000 loops, best of 3: 401 us per loop
```

So it's about 10-20% slowdown.
(FYI `repr(L)` seems to be ever so slightly faster than `L.__repr__()`.)
So perhaps we should make them all `CombinatorialObject` instead of `tuple`...?

The other option to this would be having `__getitem__()` and the like return tuples or copies of the lists. I'm worried this might also result in a slowdown in code that is called significantly more often.

For point 2., that shared data comment is about creating a tableau from another tableau. I use `Family` when I want immutable dictionaries, although I would still use a list of list (type) approach to arbitrary shaped tableaux.

`t = map(tuple, t)` sounds like a good idea to me. The immutability of the outer list is handled by `CombinatorialObject`, so we only need to care about the inner ones.

Is `_repr_` slowdown important? That is, is `_repr_` used in any non-IO contexts such as hashing and caching? (I know it sometimes is; the question whether it is here.)

Is `_repr_` the only thing that gets slowed down if we replace the (inner) lists by tuples? I'd say it should be, because any method on tableaux that needs to mess around with rows as lists currently needs to clone them before doing so, and experiments tell me that `t[:]` is considerably faster when `t` is a tuple than when `t` is a list:

```
sage: g = tuple(range(15))
sage: %timeit g[:]
10000000 loops, best of 3: 73.4 ns per loop
sage: g = range(15)

sage: g = tuple(range(3))

sage: g = range(3)
sage: %timeit g[:]

This might and not might be related, but do you have any idea where the slowdowns in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14711#comment:107 come from?

`@`Nicolas: Thank you. Can you remind me how `ClonableList` differs from `CombinatorialObject`? Does it allow mutation at clone time?

Currently tableaux can have non-integer entries, and this is both useful and used (e.g. for skew tableaux). So I'm not convinced of switching to C ints.

```
        if self._hash is None:

So the `__repr__` is not used, but rather the list is taken into a string and the latter is hashed. I assume this won't take any longer with tuples? Or am I looking at the wrong hash function?

One is that `ClonableList` is cythonized

> Currently tableaux can have non-integer entries, and this is both useful and used (e.g. for skew tableaux). So I'm not convinced of switching to C ints.

I would not switch to C ints since we I believe the crystals of tableaux are filled with wrappers around ints. In either case, it is very conceivable to me that we would want non C ints as entries.

The `__str__()` ends up calling the `__repr__()`, and then the resulting string is hashed since we can't just hash lists. For tuples, we can just call `hash(self._list)`.

*shrugs* Actually those parents aren't being recreated on startup, I misremembered / misread Simon's comment. It's about when running all tests. There might be some dependency cycle (perhaps directly in the morphism, but maybe not) which creates a tableau (and hence `Tableaux()`) that becomes completely weakly referenced with #14711 and so it gets garbage collected. *shrugs* IDK, it would require some detailed searching and analysis.

This is a bit ugly at the moment:


```
sage: t = Tableau([[1,2],[3]])
sage: list(t)
[(1, 2), (3,)]
sage: t.to_list()
[[1, 2], [3]]
```


The first calls the iterator, while the second returns an actual copy with the tuples converted to lists.
