# Issue 11234: improve plot documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Here are some improvements to the plot documentation, specifically with the linestyle.  It also works around a possible bug in matplotlib in setting up the drawstyle of a line (so I marked this defect).

No, I don't think so.  It does directly answer a question someone had from PREP, though, and provides an illustrating example (plotting the points of a line without connecting them)

matplotlib is insanely awesome.

```
sage: plot(sin,-5,5,linestyle='',marker='$\spadesuit$', markeredgecolor='red',markerfacecolor='green')
```

Love this.

Did you report the possible bug upstream?  Of course it wasn't even there before to be seen (in the doc).  This does fix the problem.

Interesting that you say it answer the PREP question (which it does) - I would have just told someone to use points(list) rather than line(list).  But this is still good to add to the doc in plot.py, which is all most people will look at.

This looks great - positive review.

Whoops - except for the commit message.

Our points command needs to be drastically improved.  It doesn't take hardly any options right now.

I'll try to fix the commit message soon.

I think this should suffice.

Apply [attachment:trac-11406-plot-docs-right-commit-message.patch].
