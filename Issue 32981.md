Looks good! Just two small suggestions.

- This appears to make it a tiny bit faster:

```diff
-        rem = self.parent().zero()
+        cdef Polynomial rem = self.parent().zero()
```


- While we're at it, we could also fix this (to catch `p=0`):

```diff
-        if p.degree() == 0:
-            raise ArithmeticError("The polynomial, p, must have positive degree.")
+        if p.is_constant():
+            raise ArithmeticError("The polynomial, p, must be non-constant.")
```
