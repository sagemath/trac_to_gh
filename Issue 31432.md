Keywords: homology, cohomology

In this ticket, we equip the category of chain complexes with a method `homology` yielding the associated homology. The corresponding homology functor will use this method. We furthermore establish a new category of cochain complexes.

This happens in view of ÄŒech cohomology, Morse homology and de Rham cohomology on manifolds.

Comments and opinions are as always welcome.

`chain_complex` doesn't make a distinction between chain and cochain complexes. Probably because it also allows multigrading.

Should we remove the category of cochain complexes then? I mean, in a broad sense, cochain complexes can be seen as generalized chain complexes, no?

Btw, is it customary to add a mathematical description in the category section?

There is no difference as the degree of the chain map is part of the data of a chain complex. I agree that it is good to *not* have a category of cochain complexes.

You can add a very brief description to the category, but nobody really reads that part IMO.

Rather than raise a `NotImplementedError`, it is better if you mark them as ``@`abstract_method`.

`_apply_functor_to_morphism` is missing doctests.

I would not change the title doc of `chain_complex.py`. It is possible that non-bounded chain complexes are added to that file eventually.

Should we allow `HomologyFunctor` to have a default of `n=None` so it returns the entire homology?

This is a more of a question for John. When I think of cohomology, I think there should be some extra ring structure. If the degree of the differential is negative, can we generally assume there is a ring structure on the homology or is this something special based on the construction?

That is because we don't have any examples to apply here, or do we?

Well, that can be done if that finally happens, no?

Have you checked my last commits? I already dropped most things you are referring to.

Instead of `homology_raw`, I have introduced two methods: `lift_from_homology` and `reduce_to_homology` which lifts an homology class to a representative and reduces a cycle to its homology class respectively. These can be overwritten depending on the implementation.

As for renaming: I really don't care. I just think that it is way smoother if the title fits the content. What I meant: you can change it back as soon as the implementation has been generalized, at which point the documentation needs to be refactored anyway.

Okay, I understand what you are trying to do. I didn't realize you were changing your approach with your last commit. It might be a slight abuse to have a functor for all `n`, but I think it should be fine.

> As for renaming: I really don't care. I just think that it is way smoother if the title fits the content. What I meant: you can change it back as soon as the implementation has been generalized, at which point the documentation needs to be refactored anyway.

I am still a -1 on changing the title docstring of `chain_complex.py`. That file is for chain complexes. Just because we happen to have only bounded ones implemented doesn't mean we need to limit it right now.

Yes, I think it is.

Some comments:

Doctest failure:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/homology/hochschild_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed

I would use `_n` instead of `__n` as we don't need the name mangling.

A useful construction is `Cat.or_subcategory(input_cat)`, which automatically returns `Cat` when `input_cat=None`.

I still don't think this is what we should use. For example, assume that the class represents an object in the category of groups. Now I want to inherit from this class and turn it into a ring. Passing `Rings()` to the initialization would then cause an error:


```
sage: Groups().or_subcategory(Rings())

   1879             return category
   1880 
ValueError: Subcategory of `Category of groups` required; got `Category of rings
```


Even with `join=True` we get an undesired result:


```
sage: Groups().or_subcategory(Rings(), join=True)
Category of inverse rings
```


What we really want to do is overwrite the category in that case.

That error is telling you that you are doing something mathematically nonsensical. A ring is not a (multiplicative) group because it doesn't have inverses. Thus, your example gives even more reason you want to use it.

Right, Sage distinguishes between multiplicative and additive groups. Probably a bad example. The same error would occur for additive groups though, except that `join=True` gives what we want. But I am not sure whether we always want to join categories and never make it possible to overwrite them for inheritance purposes.

I am sure you can somehow construct another example that leads to something undesirable. Besides, there must be a reason why `or_subcategory` is literally never used for that purpose.

I'd appreciate an additional opinion here. Matthias?

It does not result in an error:

```
sage: from sage.categories.additive_groups import AdditiveGroups
sage: AdditiveGroups().or_subcategory(Rings())
Category of rings
```


> But I am not sure whether we always want to join categories and never make it possible to overwrite them for inheritance purposes.

I don't understand. Join categories are used all over the place in Sage. When creating a new category, we often (maybe even typically) build it as a join or a subcategory thereof.

> I am sure you can somehow construct another example that leads to something undesirable.

If you do, then you are exposing a bug in the category hierarchy.

> Besides, there must be a reason why `or_subcategory` is literally never used for that purpose.

This is used in many places in Sage:

```

Mh, you are right, it works. But according to the documentation this input should be invalid, too:


```
or_subcategory(category=None, join=False)
Return category or self if category is None.

INPUT:

    category â€“ a sub category of self, tuple/list thereof, or None

    join â€“ a boolean (default: False)
```


In that case, the documentation should be revised.
