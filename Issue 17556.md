This doctest tests against a wrong result, the resulting curve must have a quadratic part:

```
            sage: f = piecewise([[(-1,1),1]])                             ## example 2
            sage: g = piecewise([[(0,3),x]])
            sage: f.convolution(g)
            Piecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(-1, 1), 0], [(1, 2), -3/2*x], [(2, 4), -3/2*x]]
```

The ticket is for documentary reasons because a new piecewise code is being worked on in #14801.

See also #12123 (possibly the same?) Actually, the fix should be pretty easy once one understands the code, but I gave up [comment:5:ticket:12123 here].

Changing priority from major to minor.

Works in the new `piecewise` from #14801. 
Dup of #12123, which is why I'm setting this to "dup/needs review"

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
