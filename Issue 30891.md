```markdown
Currently, cffi 1.14.3 fails to build with homebrew python 3.9 on
Mac OSX Big Sur, see the comments in [https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/1rJF7CzEksY](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/1rJF7CzEksY).
This error has been fixed in cffi 1.14.4.  As per usual you can configure with

./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url

to download from pypi.
```
