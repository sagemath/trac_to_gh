This is the second ticket for my Google Summer of Code project (the first was #23257: Plotting the Mandelbrot set). I have added the `external_ray` function to the `Complex Dynamics` folder.

I haven't had a chance to do much testing yet. So far it appears to work well in the notebook, but I need to do a thorough code review. Here is at least one error:


```
sage: external_ray(3/7,D=70)
ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
```

if you zoom in, it looks like something is going wrong with the later Newton's methods

```
sage: external_ray(3/7,D=60, image_width=0.1, x_center=-1.75)
```


here are a few minor things I picked out:

- need to input check 0<=  ray <=1

- need to wrap the long lines (90 characters is the typical limit)

- add a ray color example

- change the first long example to a decimal

- in warning:
  - typo 'specify the which'

- you shouldn't need to keywords for the mandelbrot set here.

It would be cleaner to default image to None. Then after you .pop image you check if 'is None' and if true mandelbrot_plot. If you use .get() instead of .pop() you can pass kwds directly to mandelbrot_plot.

- you can just say, theta = list(theta) instead of 

```
    if type(theta) != list:
        theta = [theta]
```


- put something in the doc about: if the ray doesn't reach the boundary increase D, if the ray looks jagged increase S. Has a speed penalty

Just one very minor comment

In the description of the input `R` there is an extra word or something. Also, I'd add the comment similar to the other parameters that if R is too small Newton's method may not converge to the correct ray.
