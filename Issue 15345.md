Does the ticket author need to update the `checksum.ini` (via the script) and `package-version.txt` (plus possibly add a changelog to `SPKG.txt`) when doing the version bump, or will that be done by the release manager?

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-12-25 01:02:58

Yes: author does checksum.ini, package-version.txt

No: changelog in SPKG.txt is deprecated

I also had to update the checksum for the libgap spkg. If it works for you, then its a positive review.

Looks like the generator ordering changed again for various gap objects.

Note that conjugacy classes of `SymmetricGroup(8)` now need the table of marks (`database_gap`), the bound was a little bit higher in previous versions. This is not too surprising since Gap rewrote their conjugacy class code. I've simplified examples to `SymmetricGroup(7)`, going to 8 doesn't really test anything that 7 doesn't already cover.

I agree. Tests pass for me too, so positive review.

The segfault also occurs with vanilla gap-4.7.2. Reported upstream at http://tracker.gap-system.org/issues/461
