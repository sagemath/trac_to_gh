Keywords: memleak, elliptic curves

Using the following piece of code makes the memory footprint of sage 
 grow indefinitely: 


sage: K = GF(1<<50,'t') 
 sage: j = K.random_element() 
 sage: while 1: 
 ....:    E = EllipticCurve(j=j) 
 ....:    del E 
 ....: 


This seems to be less dramatic with finite fields of char != 2 and 
inexistant for ZZ and QQ.

However this makes big computations involving different elliptic curves quite inpractical.

Calling gc.collect() just after the creation prevents the memory problem.

But it does not if called later.

increasing when I run the code in the ticket description.

I just retested it and it seems to fix the memleak for me:

no increase in memory footprint after 30 minutes.

Which code did you run ?

The one in the tickect description or the one on sage-support post ?

Because there are other memleaks involved when using EllipticCurve class.

See #11495 and #11521 for example.

I used the code in the ticket description.

I will try again.

I must have forgotten to do 'sage -b' when I tried before.  Apologies
for the noise.

This time when I applied the patch (and did 'sage -b') the code in the
ticket description ran for 30 CPU minutes without an increase in memory.
I also did 'make testlong' and all tests passed.

Positive review!
