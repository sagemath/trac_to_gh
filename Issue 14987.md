Now works as advertised for toric varieties obtained from complete fans!  Does this patch apply to affine fans as well?  (I tried the example of a fan obtained from the first quadrant in the plane, and got an accurate list of points, though the use of colons in that setting is weird.)

We could use this to update #14891, which was only implemented for non-singular toric varieties.

Its supposed to give the correct answer for all fans. If it doesn't then its a bug.

I already incorporated it with #14891, for example `X.point_set().cardinality()` will use the formula if the variety is smooth and enumerate the points otherwise.

We should add a documentation example where the fan is not complete.  The blowup of a point, where the fan has two cones, one from [(1,0),(1,1)] and one from [(0,1),(1,1)] would be a nice choice: in that setting, you can see a projective line when the coordinate corresponding to (1,1) is 0.

This code throws errors when the toric variety has torus factors (that is, when the rays of the fan do not span the vector space associated with N).  For example:

V = ToricVariety(Fan([Cone([(1,0)])]))

VF = V.change_ring(GF(3))

list(VF.point_set())

yields:

ValueError: there must be 2 coordinates! Got only 1: (0,)

This behaviour does not really surprise me.  When a toric variety has torus factors, the choice of homogeneous coordinates is non-canonical.  I assume homogeneous coordinates are not implemented in Sage for such a variety.

We have the "virtual rays" of the fan to keep track of an arbitrary (but fixed) choice of coordinates on the torus factor. Its just a matter of hooking them up correctly. 

Adding another example is fine with me, can do that tomorrow.
