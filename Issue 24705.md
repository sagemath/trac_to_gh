Move the root finding code of polynomial ring over SR from the generic method `roots` in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` to the specialized `_roots_univariate_polynomial` that has to be put directly in the base ring `SR` (code in `symbolic/ring.pyx`).

There must be some fuzziness on if SR is the base ring, or the ring argument of roots().

I am not sure we want to support the `ring` argument when different from `None`/`SR`. Do you? If so, you should add proper examples.

BTW, in the doctest `(x^2 + x + 1).roots(SR)` the `SR` should not be needed.

`_roots_univariate_polynomial` is a method of the base ring not of the polynomial. That being said, the code in `radical_expression` would better be changed to

```diff
- roots = poly.roots(SR, multiplicities=False)
+ roots = poly.change_ring(SR).roots(multiplicities=False)
```

Is nearly as slow, despite being more correct. I tried converting to SR, or calling `_symbolic_` on the poly but it's even slower. If these are Flint polys, I could put code in Pynac for fast conversion.

Conversion from ZZ can already be improved

```
sage: a = ZZ(23)
sage: %timeit SR(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.51 µs per loop
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 218 ns per loop
```

which is basically the same x15 ratio as in

```
sage: p = polygen(ZZ)^2 + 1
sage: %timeit p.change_ring(SR)
1000 loops, best of 3: 322 µs per loop
sage: %timeit p.change_ring(RR)
100000 loops, best of 3: 12.9 µs per loop
```

These are different operations. You seem to confuse polynomials with coefficients in SR like `SR['x'].gen()^2 + 1` and the corresponding element of SR `SR.var('x')^2 + 1`.

If you have a polynomial `p`, the operations `SR(p)` and `p.change_ring(SR)` are different. In the second case, you change the ring of the coefficients. Not the fact that it is a Sage polynomial.

The biggest part (230µs) of these 300µs is spent in `Expression.__nonzero__` disproving `x^2 + 1 == 0`. So again, it's calling the wrong function when comparing an expression with zero, that leads to performance issues.

I have no problems with that, but can't contribute much.

You can at least give your opinion. "My" solution consists in removing three lines of code in `SymbolicRing._coerce_map_from_`
