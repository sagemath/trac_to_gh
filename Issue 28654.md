This ticket fixes the broken ascii and unicode art of symbolic series by implementing the appropriate conversions to Sympy (which are called by the generic character art methods of symbolic expressions).

Before:

```
sage: unicode_art(exp(x).series(x, 4))
(1, +, 1*x, +, 1/2*x², +, 1/6*x³, +, Order(x⁴⁾)
sage: unicode_art(exp(x).series(x==1, 3))
((e), +, (e)*(x, -, 1), +, (1/2*e)*(x, -, 1)², +, Order((x, -, 1)³⁾)
```


After:

```
sage: unicode_art(exp(x).series(x, 4))
         2    3
        x    x     ⎛ 4⎞
1 + x + ── + ── + O⎝x ⎠
        2    6
sage: unicode_art(exp(x).series(x==1, 3))
                         2
                ℯ⋅(x - 1)     ⎛       3       ⎞
ℯ + ℯ⋅(x - 1) + ────────── + O⎝(x - 1) ; x → 1⎠
                    2
```


Extra care is taken to allow series expansions at non-zero positions as above, as Sympy's function `O` takes slightly different arguments than Sage's `Order`.
