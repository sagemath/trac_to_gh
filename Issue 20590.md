Number fields currently have "partial unique representation": they are created by a `UniqueFactory`, but can still compare equal without being identical.  The goal of this ticket is to make number fields inherit from `WithEqualityById`, so that they fully satisfy unique representation: the conditions of being identical, being equal and having the same defining data are all equivalent.

Nice!

A very minor point: It took me a while to understand what you meant by “This allows the UniqueFactory to distinguish embeddings into different fields with "the same" image of the generator“: perhaps something like “...with images of the generator that compare equal” would be clearer.
