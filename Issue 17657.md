That's nice!

However, when I click on the right button to get the jsmol menu, I cannot access to submenus (e.g. zoom). This is with Sage 6.6.rc0.
Also, there was a small conflict in src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py when merging into Sage 6.6.rc0 (`instance.install_spec()` --> `instance._install_spec()` and `instance.symlink_resources()` --> `instance._symlink_resources()`)

I don't think the menu is possible. In the current ipython notebook, everything must be embedded in the cell output. But jsmol has no interface to pass the menu in, it insists on loading it in a separate request.

OK I see. Anyway, it is already very nice to have interactive 3D plots in the ipython notebook. Thank you for this work!

Wish I had noticed earlier you had another instance of `os.environ[IPYTHONDIR]` in there before it was positively reviewed. Expect a follow up ticket normalizing it to `get_ipython_dir`.
