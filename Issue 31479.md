LGTM except you lost the doctest for `MPolynomial._integer_`. Once you add one, you can set a positive review.

Thanks for spotting that. My goal was actually to *remove* the `_integer_` method (done in e40555a). I copied over the tests in `_scalar_conversion` (779b1ad).

Once the patchbot comes back green, positive review.

I suspect (but have not checked) that #32078 was caused by the changes here.
