The classes `RingHomset_generic` and `RingHomset_quo_ring` in `sage.rings.homset` still have a custom `__call__()` method and an old-style `_coerce_impl()`.  The goal of this ticket is to merge these into a simpler `_element_constructor_()` method.  This is a prerequisite for #28869.

Note on the changed doctest in `sage.categories.modules_with_basis`: `pAdicWeightSpace` is one of the few remaining parents that do not use the new coercion model.  There are a few more (Hecke algebras, lazy power series rings), but these cannot be used in this doctest because their element are not hashable.

Note that `element_class` is now `RingHomomorphism` (not a dynamically created subclass) since the latter is a Cython class, so the types that can be returned (`RingHomomorphism_{im_gens,cover,from_base}`) are indeed subclasses of it.

While looking into this I did come across something that looks like a bug:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Q = R.quo(x - 1)
sage: H = R.Hom(Q)
sage: h = R.hom(Q)
sage: h in H
False
sage: h.parent() == H
False
```

This already happens without this branch, so I suggest fixing this in a separate ticket.
