CC:  jdemeyer ncohen

In order to skip too long doctests we introduce time indications to `long time` flag like

```
sage: (2**2000 + 31).is_prime()  # long time: 1h
```

The allowed units are: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days).

We also modify the `--long` option of `sage -t` to allow skipping too long default (with a default at 10 sec).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19519

That is what I wanted but I do not know how to make an option that at the same time is valid with or without a value. I don't think that is even possible since the following is a valid syntax

```
sage -t --maxtime 1s test.py
```

In the above example, you can not distinguish between the value of your option and an argument of the command line.

The only way would be to always wait for an argument to `--long`. What do you think?

Hellooooooo !

What is the default behaviour of `--long` ? Run *all* long tests while ignoring their length? Or will `--long` become an alias for `--long 2s` or something?

THaaaaaaanks,

The patch says "If set to `True` it will  be set to 10 seconds."

Btw, I think that http://sage.sis.uta.fi/documentation/developer/doctesting.html#testing-a-module should contain a link 
to http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-tests , or maybe the whole paragraph should be moved?

This ticket seems to be stalled. Are we still making this?

Somehow "30 seconds" sound odd, when we have no reference machine. With years to pass this means that "long" tests will take less than a second but will not be tested.
