From https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35623/memory-leak-when-doing-anf-of-boolean-functions/ :

```
sage: import gc

....: for i in range(1,51):

These objects leak.

The problem is that upon creation:

```
    B=BooleanPolynomialRing(3,"x")
```

the code

```
    self._monom_monoid = BooleanMonomialMonoid(self)
```

is executed. A `BooleanMonomialMonoid` is `UniqueRepresentation`, so `B` goes as a key into a global `WeakValueDictionary`, with value the monoid `M`. So `B` will not be garbage collected while `M` exists (the strong reference in the global dict will only be erased on the weakvalue callback upon M's deallocation)

But `B` stores a reference to `M` in `B._nomom_monoid`, so `M` will not be deallocated until `B` is deallocated. Hence, the memory leak.

Possible strategies:
- Remove `UniqueRepresentation` from `BooleanMonomialMonoid`. I don't think there are any drawback from this solution.
- remove the strong reference `B._nomom_monoid` and instead rely on the `UniqueRepresention` property to reconstruct the thing every time. I suspect this will slow things down.
- change the construction parameters of `BooleanMonomialMonoid` to be just strings etc. and not refer to `B` at all. This is easy to get wrong.

By the way, the code from the asksage question referred to unovers the following additional bug, which made the memory leak noticeable.

`sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanPolynomialRing` is not `UniqueRepresentation` and instead relies on `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor.BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` to get uniqueness. 

In 
`sage.crypto.boolean_function.BooleanFunction.algebraic_normal_form`
the class is called directly, so we end up with many equal-but-not-identical rings (which is not a problem in its own right)

It seems that removing the `UniqueRepresentation` only makes the pickling problems reappear, so if we can find a different solution for the pickling problem we might be good to go.

So if we remove the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior from the `BooleanMonomialMonoid`, we would probably have to manually implement some form of pickling.

Actually, from a quick glance through the code, I don't see a point to having `BooleanMonomialMonoid`, we are not really using that it is a parent. We essentially just need the element class and we can mimic what we do for usual polynomials, have `monomials()` return elements in the polynomial ring. It's more work to fix, but I think the net result will be much cleaner and simpler code.

Small stylistic corrections in convert_to_pE:
1. "definig" should be "defining".
2. ``p = cE.get_pc()`` should be ```p = cE.get_pc()```
3. I think that English prefers "vice versa" over "viceversa", unlike Italian or Spanish.

In lift_to_polynomial() and lift_to_polynomial_rational_reconstruction() "poly" seems weird. Maybe just "Compute a lift to a polynomial ring `R` using rational reconstruction."
Also "recontruction" should be "reconstruction", and ``self`` should be ```self``` in few places.

In both gcd() methods the default value for the algorithm keyword should come first:

```
    - ``pari`` - use pari routines.
    - ``modular`` - (default) modular algorithm using NTL.
```


In Polynomial_absolute_number_field_dense at

```
raise ValueError("unknown algorithm %s" % (algorithm))
```

The string format should be `(algorithm, )`.

After discussing with Travis again, we decided that it's best not to remove `BooleanMonomialMonoid`, as it looks like its often used implicitly in the code.

Instead we decided to do the following:
* `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` should create the `BooleanMonomialMonoid` and pass a reference of this object to `BooleanPolynomialRing.__init__` (replacing the `n` and `names` arguments).
* `BooleanPolynomialRing` stores this reference, instead of creating the `BooleanMonomialMonoid` itself.
* Delete the reference to `BooleanPolynomialRing` from `BooleanMonomialMonoid` and thus rewrite all lines where this reference is used.
* To clean things up, move the caching done in `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` to `BooleanPolynomialRing.__init__`.
