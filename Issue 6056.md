New HISTORY.txt file is up at 



http://www.sagemath.org/src/announce/HISTORY.txt



It includes releases up to and including Sage 4.0.1. Since I'll be updating this file, my working draft is available at



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/doc/changelog/HISTORY.txt



I think this ticket can be closed now. There's no need to merge any patch. All one has to do is make sure that the above links aren't broken.

I'll be updating `HISTORY.txt` after each release. I think this ticket can be closed now, since there's no patch to apply.

I'm changing this to positive review so the release manager(s) would pick it up and close it as appropriate.
