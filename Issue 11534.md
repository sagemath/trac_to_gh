I cannot test whether the spkg actually builds on that platform, otherwise positive review for the spkg (i.e., it's "clean" and the change doesn't affect any other platform).

Although I'd change the following comment in `spkg-install`:

```sh
        *) # e.g. ppc64
```


(And the subsequent `if [ "$UNAME" = ... ]; then ...` aren't very nice. I'd use `case "$UNAME" in ...` or at least `elif ...` instead, as mentioned on earlier tickets.)

P.S., for the record:

This:

An appropriate error message in case `cp` failed would be better. The exit codes of other `cp` commands aren't checked either.

Please note that #11504 has had a p4 ready for review for weeks (and might I note for a rather more important platform than PPC Linux).  All that one needs is a review that the spkg is actually correctly formed and works on a non-Cygwin box; it has already been reviewed to install Tachyon correctly on Cygwin.  

So I'm putting #11504 as a dependency.  If you want to use BDFL privileges, I won't complain too much, but it would probably be easier just to unpack #11504's spkg and review it quick :)

I agree with Leif that this needs work for fixing the comment about ppc64, which apparently does now work :)   I don't know about the "please complain on sage-devel" comment, either; that could be more precise.  

I do think that the "not very nice" things Leif mentioned can be left to another ticket, though.

Agreed, with the exception of the `exit 0` regardless of whether the installation (the final `cp`) succeeded or not.

I guess the spkg needs work for Darwin, too, (on a follow-up) anyway, because of

```sh
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" ]; then
    #make macosx-thr
    # The threaded version of the 0.98 beta doesn't work on OS X.
    if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
        echo "Building 64 bit MaxOSX"
        $MAKE macosx-64
    else
        $MAKE macosx
    fi
    finished
fi
```

(The mentioned beta version is of years ago. I also did not know *MaxOSX*.)

Haven't looked at #11504 yet; will try to review it [as is] if I find the time... ;)

New p5 spkg based on Karl-Dieter's p4 from #11504 is up (see ticket's descriptions).

Took a bit longer because I had to check and fix another Cygwin issue.

Given the ringing endorsement of PPC Linux by the author, I'm inclined to trust him :)

<rant>
Sometime I'm going to still try to install Linux on an old eMac, and then we'll have another machine... Maybe once my home computer falls too far behind.  It already can't use the latest Flash, latest this, latest that - SO annoying, because there is nothing wrong with it, just companies that think it's not worth it to support older equipment.  You can bet there are still people who make parts for seven-year-old cars!

Builds and installs without problems, so in some sense the goal of #11504 is already fulfilled.    `ls -l local/bin` confirms that the new binary is the new Tachyon.  

But now we are more ambitious!  We want it to actually *work*.  And [it does](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/tachyonpic2.png)!  The Tachyon interface test also works appropriately.

So positive review for anything I am qualified to comment on or care about.

I'm happy with a positive review... ;)

(And I guess you, too, since now you shouldn't have to delete the DS_Store files from your superseded p4.)

For follow-up Tachyon tickets:

Should check which parts of the upstream docs are really needed; I noticed at least one (fairly small) compressed tarball with HTML files below `src/`.
