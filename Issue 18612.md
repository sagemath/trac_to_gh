sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import EnumeratedSetFromIterator

Free module generated by {0, 1, -1, 2, -2, ...} over Integer Ring

sage: C.basis().category()
Category of enumerated sets
sage: U.basis().category()
Category of finite enumerated sets

But clearly the basis of `U` is not finite.

Source of this problem is that the tensor product uses a `sage.combinat.combinat.MapCombinatorialClass` for the cartesian product, and the `LazyFamily` constructor assumed all `CombinatorialClass` objects to be finite. An extra check for `is_finite` has been added in this case. The check is caught since `is_finite` might not be implemented.

Note that it's important not to treat the negative answer of `is_finite` as affirmation that the class is actually infinite; whether the set is finite or not might just not be known, or to expansive to check.

Hello,

1. Why a special care for `CombinatorialClass` is even needed at all? The following would be much simpler

```
category = EnumeratedSets()
if set in Sets().Finite() or isinstance(set, (list,tuple)):
    category = category.Finite()
elif set in Sets().Infinite():
    category = category.Infinite()
```


2. Your documentation lines are too long.

Vincent

The bug illustrated by the example in the ticket description is still present in 9.7.beta8

The underlying implementation has changed. `CombinatorialClass` is no longer involved. The bug is now in `sage.misc.mrange._is_finite` (used by `sage.combinat.cartesian_product`):

```
sage: from sage.misc.mrange import _is_finite
sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import EnumeratedSetFromIterator
sage: EnumeratedSetFromIterator(ZZ).category()
Category of facade enumerated sets
sage: _is_finite(EnumeratedSetFromIterator(ZZ))
True
