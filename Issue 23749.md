I successfully tested a few orders using the following magma code:


```
K<a> := QuadraticField(-23);
O := sub< MaximalOrder(K) | 240 >;
print PicardNumber(O);
// 288

K<a> := QuadraticField(-3);
O := sub< MaximalOrder(K) | 6 >;
print PicardNumber(O);
// 3
```

PARI/GP actually computes class numbers for all quadratic orders. So I would rather implement this as simply a call to `pari.qfbclassno(D)`.

I replaced the formula with a call to `pari.qfbclassno` (thanks for pointing that function out!). I added some examples for real and imaginary non-maximal quadratic orders, and changed the error message accordingly.

Looks good to me.
