This ticket keeps track of any capabilities that were in sagenb that for whatever reason are not in Jupyter.  Note that it is a metaticket, and not all tickets from it may end up being resolved.  If you open a ticket for one of these, please add the link in the description.

See #25837 for a list and background, as well as [this wiki page](https://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook).

Open tickets:

* #26101 - Inline view isn't as good as sagenb was
* #25015 - introspection could be improved in Jupyter
* #29888 - automatic_names in Jupyter
No ticket yet:

* Missing TinyMCE or other rich text editor (see [comment:44:ticket:25837 this comment])
* jsmol doesn't seem to work (see [this upstream](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1872) and [comment:45:ticket:25837 this comment]) so exporting images is difficult
