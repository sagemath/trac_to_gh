# Issue 29652: Metaticket for any Jupyter improvements for things that were in sagenb

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29889

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2020-06-17 18:17:55

CC:  slelievre

This ticket keeps track of any capabilities that were in sagenb that for whatever reason are not in Jupyter.  Note that it is a metaticket, and not all tickets from it may end up being resolved.  If you open a ticket for one of these, please add the link in the description.

See #25837 for a list and background, as well as [this wiki page](https://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook).

Open tickets:

* #26101 - Inline view isn't as good as sagenb was
* #25015 - introspection could be improved in Jupyter
* #29888 - automatic_names in Jupyter
No ticket yet:

* Missing TinyMCE or other rich text editor (see [comment:44:ticket:25837 this comment])
* jsmol doesn't seem to work (see [this upstream](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1872) and [comment:45:ticket:25837 this comment]) so exporting images is difficult

IMHO, the jsmol menu defect is not a major issue since there is context menu in threejs (the default 3D viewer since Sage 9.0) that allows to export the 3D view to png from the Jupyter notebook. Moreover, 3D animations with threejs are in preparation: #29194.

Best to add a notice to that wiki page to indicate that it should not be edited any more

Agreed.  I really have to sign off for the day, perhaps you can put a warning at the top?

Changing keywords from "" to "jupyter, sagenb".

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
