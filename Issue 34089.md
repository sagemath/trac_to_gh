The documentation of `an_affine_basis()` is now incorrect as it doesn't need to be a polytope (<rant>this is why I prefer ``self`` instead of "this/the foo"</rant>). The main thing is the one-line description, but I would include the details about unbounded polyhedra in the "main" doc rather than just with the example. Otherwise LGTM.
