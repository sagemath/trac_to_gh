Keywords: interface, Regina, topology, triangulation

[Regina](http://regina.sourceforge.net/) is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists. It focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations, normal surfaces, and angle structures.

Other highlights of Regina include census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition. Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface. 

It would be nice to have an interface in Sage.

There are some instructions I wrote for installing Regina in Sage at the bottom of this page [http://regina.sourceforge.net/buildtips.html](http://regina.sourceforge.net/buildtips.html).  They are somewhat involved since Regina has a number of dependencies not currently part of Sage (boost, cmake, popt, libxml).  These are easy to install, but especially on OS X where Sage lives in it's own little world, my experience is that you have to install them (with the exception, I think, of cmake) into SAGE_LOCAL for this to work.  Also, I recommend not doing make test initially because that requires another dependency and doesn't always work even then.  

I did make a test spkg for the previous release which you can find at [http://snappy.computop.org/temp/regina-4.95.spkg](http://snappy.computop.org/temp/regina-4.95.spkg), but unfortunately it only worked on about half the platforms I tested it on.  In particular, it failed to build on the VM that is Sage-on-Windows.

Changing component from interfaces to interfaces: optional.

Matthias Goerner has posted a package on PyPI that installs Regina, with its standard Python interface, into Sage.  To get it, just do:



```
sage -pip install sageRegina
```

So what you're saying is we need now is simple bindings in the Sage code since we can just make Regina a pip package.

Correct.

#31456 only adds the package, but not an interface
