[Regina](http://regina.sourceforge.net/) is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists. It focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations, normal surfaces, and angle structures.

Other highlights of Regina include census enumeration, combinatorial recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition. Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings and a low-level C++ programming interface. 

It would be nice to have an interface in Sage.

    "body": "There are some instructions I wrote for installing Regina in Sage at the bottom of this page [http://regina.sourceforge.net/buildtips.html](http://regina.sourceforge.net/buildtips.html).  They are somewhat involved since Regina has a number of dependencies not currently part of Sage (boost, cmake, popt, libxml).  These are easy to install, but especially on OS X where Sage lives in it's own little world, my experience is that you have to install them (with the exception, I think, of cmake) into SAGE_LOCAL for this to work.
