Proving mathematical correctness is not completely trivial: if one rewrites it as `exp( exponent*log(1+x))`, this is no problem. And expanding these exponential function and logarithms leads to some monomials in `x` and `exponent`. The error is `O((exponent + exponent<sup>K)*x</sup>K)` if `K` is the number of exact summands in the binomial series. Both of these error terms actually occur in the binomial expansion, so everything is fine.

Added a minor commit (one comma removed); the rest is fine.
