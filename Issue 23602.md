It looks okay to me. To be honest, the title "Partition Refinement" doesn't mean much to me, and the opening paragraph of the "Canonical augmentation" page is rather opaque, plus there are no helpful examples. So while I don't mind adding these pages to the reference manual, I lament their general state and I don't think they really contribute much. (None of this is the fault of the branch here.)

I agree. I also have no idea what `partn_ref` is about...

At least I made it a separate section so it's easy to ignore.
