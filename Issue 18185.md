# Issue 18185: Documentation bug for binary quadratic form action

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The documentation of `matrix_action_left` and `matrix_action_right` for binary quadratic forms are reversed.


```
sage: Q = BinaryQF([1,2,3]); Q
x^2 + 2*x*y + 3*y^2
sage: A = matrix(QQ,2,2,[1,2,3,4])
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Q(x+2*y,3*x+4*y)
34*x^2 + 96*x*y + 68*y^2
sage: Q.matrix_action_left(A)
17*x^2 + 74*x*y + 81*y^2
sage: Q.matrix_action_left?
...
Here the action of the matrix `M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d
\end{pmatrix}` on the form `Q(x, y)` produces the form `Q(ax+by,
cx+dy)`.
...
```
