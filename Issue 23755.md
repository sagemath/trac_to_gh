Keywords: maxima, symbolics, interfaces

Short story : Sage's `solve()`, which uses Maxima's `solve()` doesn't solve some systems solvable by Maxima's `solve` when used standalone.

See the long story and an example in [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/cGpJmhps3lI) sage-support post.

The prime suspects are the initializations we use to set Maxima up for use with sage. I already tried to set `domain` to `real` (which is the default when Maxima is used standalone, whereas we use `complex` with Sage), to no avail.

Did you try with the latest Maxima (5.41)?

(It's probably time to upgrade Sage's Maxima anyway...)

Nope : I have only 5.40 (as packaged by Debian), and Debian is late packaging 5.41...

But my point is that **our**  Maxima (5.39), invoked from the command line, is able to get a solution. The problem lies in our way to call Maxima's `solve()` from a Sage session.

Indeed. Isq that complicated ? I saw a message announcing an (your ?) intention to package it, but didn't saw a related ticket (I didn't look specifically for that, so I may have missed it).
