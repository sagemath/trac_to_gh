I assume I can close the duplicates #11833 and #11834.




The commit message isn't very meaningful, and should contain the ticket number, i.e. start with either "`#11835`" or "`Trac 11835:`".

Also, the filenames of patches attached to tickets should start with e.g. "`trac_11835-`", i.e., also have the ticket number in it.




In case your code is already ready to get reviewed, please also change the ticket's status to "needs review".

Minor changes to the class TernaryQF documentation and TernaryQF.xi

1.  the `polynomial` method should take a set of names as an argument:

```
def polynomial(self,names='x,y,z'):
    """..."""
    x,y,z = polygens(ZZ,names)
    return self._a * ...
```

  1.  the methods `_automorphisms_reduced` and `_border` are written rather opaquely -- why do they do what you claim?  Please include a reference, a proof, or something to indicate why they work.
  1.  typos / spelling errors: Auxiliar -> Auxillary, Ups->Oops, "it's discriminant"->"its discriminant", symmetrys->symmetries, "doesn't divides"->"doesn't divide"

_[trac_11835-TernaryQF_flat_review.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/11835/trac_11835-TernaryQF_flat_review.patch)_ contains the suggested changes.  One thing we need is a license block.  I can't add that, since Gustavo owns the copyright.  Gustavo, please add a copyright block conforming to http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files, or at the least, post a comment giving us permission to distribute this code under GPL2+.

Just for the record, you can also use the trac mark-up

```
[attachment:trac_11835-TernaryQF_flat_review.patch]
```

for such, which adds the download button: [attachment:trac_11835-TernaryQF_flat_review.patch]

Likewise, in Italics: _[attachment:trac_11835-TernaryQF_flat_review.patch]_ (same enclosed in `_ ... _`)

Works for me

Never use

```
except:
```

but catch specific exceptions instead. If you must use a catch-all, use

```
except StandardError:
```

[attachment:trac_11835-TernaryQF_4.patch] needs a proper commit message (alternatively, simply change the first patch and remove the fourth).

Implement a new class for ternary quadratic forms with integer coefficients

Ready, changed the first patch and removed the fourth.

What was the rationale for adding

```
from __builtin__ import max
```


That seems unneeded and also slower than using plain `max()`.
