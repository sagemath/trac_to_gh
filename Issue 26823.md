In order to debug crashes with cypari2 (#26442), I added some checks to cypari2. But these checks are now failing because `sig_on()` is regularly used badly inside Sage.

In particular, this branch removes code inside `sig_on()` which can potentially cause Python garbage collection.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27060

Could you say a little bit more about why these `sig_on()` are not correct?  Is it because they're releasing the GIL inappropriately?
