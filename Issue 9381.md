# Issue 9381: libm4ri not respecting SAGE_FAT_BINARY

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mariah

Original creation time: 2010-06-29 20:01:18

Assignee: Mariah Lenox

libm4ri is not respecting SAGE_FAT_BINARY
on x86-Linux, specifically sse3 if available
will be used.

A mercurial patch is attached which when
SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes", comments out the
configure test for sse3 - so configure reports
that sse3 does not exist on the machine.

* It appears your patch modified the configure script that is auto-generated by autoconf?

* It would be best to somehow change the m4ri configure.ac (?) so that you can tell it to not use sse.  This would be good to get upstreamed into m4ri.    I've emailed the developers of m4ri about this ticket, and hope they can address it.

Hi, upstream here

I think we should add an option to M4RI to not check for SSE instead. I can provide an updated M4RI later this week or next week the latest.

cf.#9475 (thus I'd say we can close this ticket as a duplicate)
