# Issue 18233: Implement the path model for B infinity

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-05-22 07:11:08

Keywords: crystals

Using the elementary crystals `B_i`, we can iterate the following crystal morphism `B(oo) \to B_i \otimes B(oo)` to obtain a crystal model for `B(oo)`. This ticket implements this model by using the fact that one only requires a finite list.

I'm not completely happy with the current implementation as it creates a lot of generally unnecessary factors and the print representation isn't great. However I'm thinking these would be for followup tickets, one which makes the printing of the elementary crystals more verbose, the other for a consolidated version for the crystal B<sub>I</sub> in the notation in the documentation.

Hi Travis,

I pushed some changes to the documentation.  If you are okay with them (and see no either new or missed mistakes), then you may set this to positive review on my behalf.

Best,
Ben
