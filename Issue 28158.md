}
```

The underlying bug is in `trace_polynomial`:

```
sage: Q[t] = t
sage: u  = t^4 + 3*t^2 + 1
sage: u.trace_polynomial() ## First answer should be t^2+1
(t^2 + t + 1, 1, 1)
```

The code is currently accessing the leading coefficient without checking the degree; the corner case that triggers this bug is when the expected "leading" coefficient is zero, and so the wrong coefficient is accessed instead.
