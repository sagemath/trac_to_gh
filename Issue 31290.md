Polymake is available on a number of systems (https://repology.org/project/polymake/versions) and also on Homebrew via a custom tap: https://polymake.org/doku.php/download/start#binary_releases

We add system package info and `spkg-configure.m4`

> With polymake from Andreas's tap, need to do `export PERL5LIB="/usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-thread-multi-2level:/usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5"` (this is done in the `polymake` script but we use the callable library through jupymake)

Setting this globally unfortunately breaks autotools (`aclocal`) from homebrew:

```
Usage: DynaLoader::dl_find_symbol(libhandle, symbolname) at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/darwin-thread-multi-2level/XSLoader.pm line 89.
Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/File/Path.pm line 6.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/Cellar/polymake/4.3_1/libexec/perl5/lib/perl5/File/Path.pm line 6.
Compilation failed in require at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 33.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/bin/aclocal line 33.
```

Too bad that `polymake-config` does not advertise the necessary Perl library path...

fails to recognize polymake on Fedora 34 with polymake package installed, due to
`-Werror=format-security` in `g++` call from `./configure`.

And `Werror` gets there from `polymake-config --cflags` call.

```
USE="cdd flint normaliz libpolymake lrs nauty ppl singular" emerge --ask polymake
```

doesn't work, there is a problem with `lrs` (and Sage installs `polymake` with `lrs`)
Apparently, it's known to Sage, as `spkg-install.in` has a comment:

```
# Since polymake v3.4, it does not find our lrs installation if we do not provide --with-lrs explicitly.
```


Once this is fixed in Gentoo (sorry, I don't grok its ebuilds), `distros/gentoo.txt` should be provided (with appropriate `[..]` options?).

They don't "fail," portage tells you to pick one because you have to pick one =P

If one is a significantly better choice than the other, we would normally enable that one by default, but I don't know enough about polymake to say that either is better.

What's wrong with lrs?

`perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` does not make sense in `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` because it is a dummy script package -- we provide no spkg-install for it.

However, I don't get why you need this extra hack, rather than the result of `perl_mongodb/spkg-configure.m4`, which could be added into `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`, and which duly reports

```
perl_mongodb-none:                           no suitable system package; optional
```

These perl module packages aren't so dummy after all.

Good, then `spkg-configure.m4` (= the scope of this ticket) does its job correctly.
