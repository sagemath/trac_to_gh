Yes, several others with `interpolation="clough"` take hundreds of seconds. I'll give you more details later today.

The easiest speed up is to replace `clough` by `linear` but plot will actually lose in "quality". `clough` gives very nice and smooth plots. I think `nn` may have been caching an intermediate step that speeds things considerably when a lot of points are involved.

These are the slow tests from running `./sage -tp --long --warn-long 10 src/sage/plot`. I'm not saying that all these are because of the matplotlib upgrade.

OK.

Replying to [comment:3 jdemeyer]:
> These are the slow tests from running `./sage -tp --long --warn-long 10 src/sage/plot`. I'm not saying that all these are because of the matplotlib upgrade.

Probably not the upgrade, just tachyon being slow.

> {{{

That warrants examination in whatever case. 4s in 2011 to 49s in 2018 with probably newer hardware.

> {{{

Uncertain.

Those two are prime suspect as they both use `clough` in the second case because it is the default.

Nothing involving MPL directly, this is probably something else. That's certainly a long test.

How old is your hardware that's what I get locally

```

For normal plots you can iterate over the elements, which is usually a reasonably detailed textual representation 

```
sage: g1 = plot([x*exp(-n*x^2)/.4 for n in [1..3]], (0, 2), color='blue', aspect_ratio=.8)
sage: list(g1)
[Line defined by 210 points,
 Line defined by 221 points,
 Line defined by 219 points]
```

There is no similar solution for 3d plots afair.

Reducing the output resolution of tachyon would be fine with me; we don't test anything by raytracing big images instead of small ones except possibly for our patience.
