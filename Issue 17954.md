# Issue 17954: Automaton: representation string wrong for Automata with 1 state

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18191

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-04-14 15:08:11

Keywords: sd67


```
sage: A = Automaton()
sage: A.add_state(42)
42
sage: A
Automaton with 1 states
```

The last line is wrong and should be "...with 1 state".

Changing keywords from "sd67" to "sd67, beginner".

Also made the same correction for Transducer and FiniteStateMachine in addition to Automaton.

Hello,

While you are at it, this is also wrong

```
sage: FiniteStateMachine()
Finite state machine with 0 states
```

It should rather be `Empty finite state machine`.

Hello,

For the future: the commit message should not be that long. It must start with a one-line description (~70 characters). Possibly you can add some more comments after a line break. Something like

```
"0 states" -> "empty" for Finite State Machine

We change the method _repr_ for Automaton, Finite State Machine and
Transducer to be more friendly when there is no state.
```
