# Issue 24562: Raising NotImplemented

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24799

`open_extrep_url` in `src/sage/combinat/designs/ext_rep.py` raises NotImplemented, but I think it should be NotImplementedError. Also one in `src/sage/combinat/matrices/latin.py` seems wrong.

Someone wiht more knowledge of Python should verify this.
