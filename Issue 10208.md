See the attached patch.  I don't think the fix can be doctested, but here are some timings on `sage-4.6.1.alpha0`:

BEFORE THE PATCH:

```
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 431 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(10000)')
25 loops, best of 3: 35.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(1000000)')
5 loops, best of 3: 6.42 s per loop
```


AFTER THE PATCH:

```
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 304 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(10000)')
25 loops, best of 3: 28.9 ms per loop
sage: timeit('f = delta_qexp(1000000)')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.73 s per loop
```
