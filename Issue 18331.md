# Issue 18331: wrong expansion of (x+sqrt(2)*x)^2)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18568

This bug was recently fixed in GiNaC:

```
sage: ((x+sqrt(2)*x)^2).expand()
2*sqrt(2)*x^2 + 2*x^2 + x^2
```


This ticket will wait for Pynac to catch up and add a Sage doctest for the case.
