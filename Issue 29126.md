This is a follow-up on #28788, which implemented the current version of the "Build status for each package" displayed at the end of configure.

For an optional package that is not installed already, it displays a message like the following:

```
e_antic-0.1.5: does not support check for system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-e_antic" to install
```

In this ticket, we change the message if the package has been configured to be installed or uninstalled.

Related but not a dependency:
 #29113 - Reimplement `sage -i SPKG` for optional/experimental packages as `configure --enable-SPKG && make build`
