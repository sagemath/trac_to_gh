CC:  pfili @enderwannabe @bhutz

The method for number fields iterates over the points of bounded height for each coordinate. This includes all the appropriate points, but includes some other points that are larger than the specified bound.


```
B=3
K.<v>=QuadraticField(3)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
for Q in P.points_of_bounded_height(bound=B):
    if exp(Q.global_height()) > B+0.001:
        print(Q,exp(Q.global_height()))
```

The simplest fix here is probably to check the height before yielding the point. This is not efficient, but would yield correct results, since every correct point does occur in this method.

If I don't hear another suggestion before I have time to fix this, I'll implement that (hopefully in the next week or two).

It might be worth it to implement a temporary fix in the mean time.

I think you are right. Taking a look at the point `(v : v : 1)`, we have

``` 
sage: X(P([v,v,1])).global_height() - log((RR(5^(1/3))))
1.11022302462516e-16
```

I think the right fix here is not to just check inequality, but to also check that the difference between the bounds is less than `tolerance`? Taking a look at the documentation for the points of bounded height function on number fields, it seems to yield all points that are within the tolerance, so maybe we should too.

I think the error in `projective_homset.py` isn't actually an error - before the fix we were yielding points with height above the bound.
