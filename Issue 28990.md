Keywords: threejs text text3d

Attempting to plot a single piece of text using the three.js viewer results in an empty scene (besides the coordinate frame):


```
text3d("Hello world!", (1, 2, 3))
```


Inspecting the javascript in the generated HTML file, the `texts` array is empty: `var texts = []`

Adding any other Graphics3d object (even an empty one) to it fixes the problem:


```
from sage.plot.plot3d.base import Graphics3d
text3d("Hello world!", (1, 2, 3)) + Graphics3d()
```


I encountered this in my Ubuntu install based on 9.1.beta3 while working on #29194. I also tried it on my Windows install which is still 8.9, and the bug is present there as well.

I believe it's because [rich_repr_threejs](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx#L401) is expecting the text to always be 2 levels deep after flattening: the `for` loop grabs the 1st level, and the `hasattr(p.all[0], 'string')` is looking at the 2nd level. For a single piece of text, it's only 1 level deep (below a `TransformGroup`). But when added to another `Graphics3d` object it becomes 2 levels deep (that `TransformGroup` is now below a `Graphics3dGroup`).

A similar bug can be produced going in the opposite direction (too many levels):


```
sage: t1 = text3d("t1", (0,0,1))
sage: t2 = text3d("t2", (0,1,0))
sage: t3 = text3d("t3", (1,0,0))
sage: g12 = t1 + t2
sage: g12 = g12.translate(-1,-1,-1)
sage: g123 = g12 + t3
sage: show(g123)
```


In this case, only "t3" gets displayed since its text is 2 levels deep but the text nodes for "t1" and "t2" are now 3 levels deep (`Graphics3dGroup` -> `TransformGroup` -> `TransformGroup` -> `Text`).

I think `_rich_repr_threejs` may need to be modified to walk the tree of groups/transforms to find points/lines/texts instead of relying on flattening.

I ran into a closely related issue earlier today due to the presence of a `TransformGroup`:


```
def revolved(phi):
    return parametric_plot3d([x, 0, sqrt(x)], (x, 0, 1)).rotateZ(phi)
show(revolved(0))
```


...works as expected and just shows a single curve, but...


```
show(revolved(0) + revolved(pi))
```


...produces a single 3D arrow instead of the expected two curves. 

After flattening, each `Line` is under a `TransformGroup`, and both of those are under a single `Graphics3dGroup`. Thus, both lines fall into the case where `hasattr(p, '_trans')` and `hasattr(p.all[0], 'points')` are both `True`, resulting in an arrow.

Hi Paul. Do you mind if I take a shot at fixing this? I wanted to check with you first to make sure there's no duplicated effort.

I'll second that! Many thanks, Travis.

I got Sage up and running on a new 32-bit VM, and I was able to verify that your branch builds and that the test case in question now passes on both my 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

I'll keep 32-bit in mind in any future Sage work I do.
