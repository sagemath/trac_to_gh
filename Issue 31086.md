# Issue 31086: Make self-diffeomorphisms default

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31323

Currently, if you construct a diffeomorphism from a manifold to itself, you have to specify the manifold as the codmain. With the changes in this ticket, this is no longer necessary and we assume that the user want's to specify a self-diffeomorphism if no codomain is given.

Seems very reasonable and is in line with `Hom`. LGTM.

Thanks for this improvement!

Side comment: when you open a ticket like this, could you please add it to the metaticket #30525 ? This helps keeping track on what's going on, especially to prepare the [release tours](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/) and the [changelogs](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/changelog.html). I've just done it for this ticket, as well as for #31322. 
Moreover the `Cc` field of Track is not 100% reliable (recently I've not been notified about some ticket while my username was added in `Cc`; such an issue has been already reported by others in the past).
