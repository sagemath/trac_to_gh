# Issue 20960: Poset documentation polishing: Graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-08-09 19:39:48

CC:  kdilks â€‹darij

Check documentation for poset functions that returns a (di)graph.

This patch removes `wrapped`-parameter from `hasse_diagram()`, as it did nothing. Changes are minor things, just unifying some wording, moving examples that are clearly tests to tests-block etc.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141, #19360, #19435.

Kevin, I am continuing this serie. Compiling now, so not ready for review yet.

Darij: An example in `frank_network` contains numbers 12, -13, 14 and 16. Is there some reason for that?

Kevin, maybe you can check this; we can check come back to `frank_network` later.

...polynomials next... this serie seems to take a year or two.

ok, let it be. Even if I do not see the point of changing all the doctests..

Are you able to run the doctests? After applying this ticket, I was able to run doctests for unchanged files and `lattices.py`, but when I tried to test `posets.py` it just hangs until I force quit, where it shows it was using 0 CPU time. Currently upgrading from 7.4beta1 to 7.3beta3 to see if that makes a difference.

hum, one patchbot is happy with the doctests, so I did not double check.

There was a problem indeed about some test in posets.py in 7.4.beta(1-2), that has been solved in 7.4.b3

Alright, I just finished updating to 7.4b3 and it does work now.

Thanks!

I am gradually checking `posets.py`, and trying to make meaningful examples in the process. Next will be polynomials; for example `order_polynomial()` should use `as_ideals=False` when calling `order_ideals_lattice()` and so on.
