Check documentation for poset functions that returns a (di)graph.

This patch removes `wrapped`-parameter from `hasse_diagram()`, as it did nothing. Changes are minor things, just unifying some wording, moving examples that are clearly tests to tests-block etc.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141, #19360, #19435.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21197

Darij: An example in `frank_network` contains numbers 12, -13, 14 and 16. Is there some reason for that?

Are you able to run the doctests? After applying this ticket, I was able to run doctests for unchanged files and `lattices.py`, but when I tried to test `posets.py` it just hangs until I force quit, where it shows it was using 0 CPU time. Currently upgrading from 7.4beta1 to 7.3beta3 to see if that makes a difference.
