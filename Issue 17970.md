The following is slow compared to what it should be

```
sage: a = libgap.E(  2^11 * 3^4 * 5^3 )
sage: %time a.ComplexConjugate()
CPU times: user 648 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 648 ms
Wall time: 647 ms
E(20736000)^3455999+E(20736000)^17279999
```


This problem appeared during the implementation of a wrapper for the universal cyclotomic field in #18152 (see in particular [comment:23](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18152#comment:23)).
