Keywords: laurent series

The following code:

```python
R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
f = LaurentSeries(R, x).add_bigoh(7)
print(f(x))
```

crashes on sage version 8.0 with the exception:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./mfe.sage.py", line 9, in <module>
    print(f(x))
  File "sage/rings/laurent_series_ring_element.pyx", line 1426, in sage.rings.laurent_series_ring_element.LaurentSeries.__call__ (/build/sagemath/src/sage-8.0/src/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/laurent_series_ring_element.c:16230)
  File "sage/rings/power_series_pari.pyx", line 420, in sage.rings.power_series_pari.PowerSeries_pari.__call__ (/build/sagemath/src/sage-8.0/src/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/power_series_pari.c:7038)
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'parent'
```


Line 1426 of `sage/rings/laurent_series_ring_element.pyx` contains the following call:

```python
        return self.__u(x)*(x[0]**self.__n)
```


In the failing case, the variable `x` is a 1-tuple containing a ring element. However, the called method `PowerSeries_pari.__call__` in `sage/rings/power_series_pari.pyx` expects a ring element instead of a tuple.

The proposed patch decomposes the tuple before passing it to the underlying power series implementation.
