It looks like the only significant change - packaging wise - is that the patch `dont_print_Longstepwillbeused.patch` is included. The main reason for the bump seems to be purely linked to the fact that the copyright was transferred to the FSF.

It remain to be seen if the removed functionality is used in sage at all.

The soname stayed the same with a small library version change from 40.3.0 to 40.3.1. Which means no change of interface. So it should just be a drop in replacement without needing recompilation.
