In #23160 I added an initial library of helper functions for use in `spkg-build/install`, but neglected to documented them for now (the thinking at the time was that I might like to add a few more of these functions before documenting them).

However, for the sake of #22509 it makes sense to start converting most/all packages to using these, and to also promote their use to maintainers of existing and new packages, so to do that they must be documented in the developer manual.

I'm experimenting now with a Sphinx directive to read function documentation from the shell script.  Will update once I have something working.
