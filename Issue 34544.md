But again, a line break would mean we have a blank line. If what they meant was any type of whitespace, then it would be zero.

Having exactly one line break means

```
Something\n
<blankline><EOF>

Otherwise there would be zero for

Something<EOF>

> I am quite confused by this.

Yes.

- `Text\n`, then EOF -- good.
- `Text`, then EOF -- ungood - non-terminated line at EOF.
- `Text\n\n`, then EOF -- ungood - empty line before EOF.
- `Text\n \n`, then EOF -- ungood - line with trailing space.
- `Text\n `, then EOF -- plus ungood - line with trailing space, non-terminated.

I would suggest not to make style changes like this:

```
-      if a == id_anyon:
-          if x == b and y == d:
-              return 1
-          else:
-              return 0
+    if a == id_anyon:
+        return 1 if x == b and y == d else 0
```

I don't think it's universally agreed that this would be an improvement. Personally, I never use `if-else` expressions and I find them harder to read.
