# Issue 29457: conflict between lazy attribute and abstract method tester

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29694

This ticket fixes a test suite failure that occurs when a lazy attribute raises a `NotImplementedError`.


```
sage: class NotAbstract(SageObject):
....:     @lazy_attribute
....:     def bla(self):
....:         raise NotImplementedError("not implemented")
sage: NotAbstract()._test_not_implemented_methods()
...
AssertionError: Not implemented method: bla
```


The method `_test_not_implemented_methods` should only fail when an `AbstractMethod` is not implemented.
