I think the reason might be that with Sage 7.2.beta0 the numpy.matrix is not recognized as a numpy type:


```
sage: import numpy
sage: n = numpy.matrix([[1,2],[3,4]],float)
sage: from sage.structure.coerce import is_numpy_type
sage: is_numpy_type(type(n))
False
```


The code in `is_numpy_type` checks whether the `tp_name` field of its argument begins with "numpy."; in this case the `tp_name` is just "`matrix`". Maybe we should check `type(n).__module__` instead, since the official doc 
   https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_name
says that "dynamically allocated types" should not contain the module name in the `tp_type`. 


```
sage: n = numpy.matrix([[1,2],[3,4]],float)
sage: type(n).__module__
'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix'
sage: n = numpy.array([[1,2],[3,4]],float)
sage: type(n).__module__
'numpy'
```

I currently do not know how to code this check in cython, though.

The matrix constructor has been slightly changed:

* it uses a new function "might_be_numpy_array" to test for numpy array/matrix objects before actually importing numpy. This way the function "is_numpy_type" (which is geared towards numpy scalar types) can remain as fast as it was. The new function currently checks for the presence of the "newbyteorder" method.

* the conversion from numpy array/matrix to python lists now uses the numpy "tolist" method. The old code no longer worked for numpy.matrix objects (only numpy.array).
