The file `sage/tests/all.py` is imported into the global namespace, and it contains

```
from sage.modular.modsym.tests import Test as modsym
from sage.tests.arxiv_0812_2725 import *
```

There is no need for these imports, so remove them.

I am very tempted to outright remove them, but there is that part of me that says we should deprecate no matter what (when it is not a bug). I leave the final decision on that up to you, but I think it is fine to not deprecate as this does not seem to have a meaningful use being imported (perhaps I am wrong).

I can't quite imagine a serious use, but I guess our policy is that they should be deprecated. How do you deprecate an import? Convert to `lazy_import`? I'm not having much luck with that, but maybe I'll try again tomorrow.
