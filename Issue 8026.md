This is a basically a duplicate of #8024, thought #8024 says a Fortran compiler, rather than gfortran. Since you consider this critical, I'll change priority of #8024. (I'm working on it anyway, and will have something before the end of the day).

This is in any case solved by #8052 which is currently awaiting review
