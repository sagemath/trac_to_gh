CC:  simonking @fchapoton @rwst

In 'SageMath version 8.1.beta0, Release Date: 2017-07-29' I have the following behaviour, (at least with FriCAS 1.2.5)

```
def elementary(k, j):
    """
    sage: f = fricas.guessRat([elementary(5,j) for j in range(15)])[0]; f

                                 11520

    """
    return stirling_number1(j+1, j+1-k)
```

Note the bad indentation in the second line and the weird quotation mark in the third.

Fixing #22525 would probably fix this, too.

Moreover, there is no change in the code of `fricas.py` between sage 7.5.beta3 and 8.0.beta12, which is the first version I have on my computer where the bug appears.

I have no idea what could have changed - I'm afraid I need to bisect.

commit 5082c96e79a15b34779a0c9b0b43d652cdade31c
Author: Simon King <simon.king@uni-jena.de>
Date:   Tue Mar 14 14:53:36 2017 +0100

    Use single underscore _repr_ in interfaces, add more documentation concerning eval and get
```

introduced this change in #22501:

```
+    def _repr_(self):
+        """
+        Default implementation of a helper method for string representation.
...
+        """
+        P = self.parent()
+        try:
+            if self._get_using_file:

+        except AttributeError:
+            return self.parent().get(self._name).strip()
```


I think the strip should go away.  The other solution is to override it in `fricas.py`, but I really cannot think of a situation where we really want the `strip`.  Output will often be ascii-art in interfaces, and this is a default implementation.

yes, I just looked at it, and have a branch that only adds some testcases - I would set it to positive review there and make this one a dependency.  Or would you prefer it the other way round?
