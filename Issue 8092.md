From the main notebook help page:

   The file `$HOME/.sage/init.sage` is attached on startup if it exists.

But the file is not `attach`ed --- try evaluating `attached_files()`.  This is a follow-up to #7514.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/856f02edb25e8781#), [sage-notebook](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/320d494175d46012).
