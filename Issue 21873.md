there are several optional packages that either render Sage broken,
or give a lot of wrong results. Examples:

* python3

* modular_decomposition

downgrading them to experimental would at least give more warnings
to potential users.

It gives wrong results on many inputs. Moreover it is abandoned by the original upstream author(s).
See e.g. [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/Iha5__c_h44/cMrV6D6u1igJ).
The [latest](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/p7j1uZlmGII/w8Gj9WH1CAAJ) example. 

There is also a stopgap, and I think #17950 should have made it experimental already.
