there are several optional packages that either render Sage broken,
or give a lot of wrong results. Examples:

* python3

* modular_decomposition

downgrading them to experimental would at least give more warnings
to potential users.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22110

It gives wrong results on many inputs. Moreover it is abandoned by the original upstream author(s).
See e.g. [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/Iha5__c_h44/cMrV6D6u1igJ).
The [latest](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/p7j1uZlmGII/w8Gj9WH1CAAJ) example. 

There is also a stopgap, and I think #17950 should have made it experimental already.

PS. There is no implementation available to hook up (neither Java nor Perl
implementations are useful for us). Would make a good student/GSoC project, I suppose...

Personally, I think the stopgap is a sufficient solution. But I'm not against the downgrade to experimental.

Let me just check if it still builds properly...
