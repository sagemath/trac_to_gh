I'm working on polynomial interpolation at the moment, and these are starting to hurt. Most of them have workarounds, but there don't seem to be any for the expressions involving derivatives.

I've also tried with subs() and the like, but one step at a time.


```
from sage.all import *


# 1. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f', x)
g = function('g', x)
p = f
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Outputs "f(x)"



# 2. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(x)
print p.substitute_function(f(x), g(x)) # Outputs "f(x)"



# 3. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(x)
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Outputs "g(x)"



# 4. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(1)
print p.substitute_function(f(1), g(1)) # Outputs "f(1)"



# 5. Works.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(1)
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Outputs "g(1)"



# 6. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f', x)
g = function('g', x)
p = f.diff()
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Outputs "D[0](f)(x)"



# 7. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f', x)
g = function('g', x)
p = f.diff()
print p.substitute_function(f(x), g(x)) # Outputs "D[0](f)(x)"



# 8. Works.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(x).diff()
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Outputs "D[0](g)(x)"



# 9. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(x).diff()(1)
print p.substitute_function(f(x).diff(), g(x).diff()) # Outputs "D[0](f)(1)"



# 10. Fails.
x = var('x')
f = function('f')
g = function('g')
p = f(x).diff()(1)
print p.substitute_function(f, g) # Crashes.
```

It looks like I accidentally duped #6480 here.
