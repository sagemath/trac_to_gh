Issue created by migration from Trac.

Motivation: on my Ubuntu box, upgraded recently to 16.04, compiling
freetype 2.6 fails due to a glitch in libtool (see log; similar to
https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile/issues/132). The glitch disappears
with freetype 2.6.1, presumably thanks to an update of libtool.

Upgrading freetype to 2.6.1 in Sage should not hurt, and while we are
at it, we may as well upgrade to the latest version.

It's my first package upgrade; so I hope I did it right ...
