The fixes from #6848 have not been included in `sagenb.misc.sageinspect`. This ports them to SageNB

I think that #7316 is the same issue, but the patch is here, so we should close the other one as a duplicate.

Please close this ticket as a duplicate. #7316 fixes the doctests, which I have neglected to fix.
