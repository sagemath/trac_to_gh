This ticket removes some old deprecation warnings. It also changes the depth of the combinat doc index.

Hey Nathann,

Two things first off:

* Ticket #14464 removes the deprecated copy mehtods from `yang_baxter_graph.py`.

* I would not remove the `element_class` method until `CombintorialClass` has been fully removed (I've been working on getting this done, but there are some entanglements I've been trying to work out. Also, you'll notice the function is not actually deprecated).

I'll continue the review once these are changed.

Thanks,

Travis

Hellooooooooo !!

Oh. Right !

Ahem. Just being stupid `v_v`

Done ! And thank you for doing the dirty job of dealing with `CombinatorialClass` `:-/`

Hey Nathann,

I've talked it over with Nicolas and I'm still working on a draft of the restructuring of the combinat doc folder. There are some tests with doc-linking that I'm having to do as well to get it to a state we want. I also have gotten distracted by some mathematics and some other patches. This will absolutely be done by the Sage Days in Orsay.

Best,

Travis

? Well, it is all very nice but how is that related with this patch ? It's small, it removes code and changes the doc's depth `O_o`

Hey Nathann,

I do not like the result of decreasing the combinatorics doc's depth. The principle is to improve the readability of the combinatorics documentation, and that is what the review patch aims to do. Plus it was something I was already working on. If you want to remove the old deprecations, we can do that now, but I do not want the doc's depth to simply decrease. I believe this makes it more difficult to look through the reference manual (for things not sitting at the combinatorics level, ex. symmetric functions, crystals).

Best,

Travis

Yo !

Oh. Ok.

It really is a mess right now, you know..

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/index.html

Which review patch are you talking about ?

> Plus it was something I was already working on. 

Well.  Yeah, but it's not done yet...

> If you want to remove the old deprecations, we can do that now

Cool, let's do it then !

> , but I do not want the doc's depth to simply decrease. I believe this makes it more difficult to look through the reference manual (for things not sitting at the combinatorics level, ex. symmetric functions, crystals).

Well, symmetric functions and crystal would both have an entry in the reduced listing. And as there would be fewer entries one would have an actually chance to see them.

The other point is that reducing the depth would have made people take care of the doc instead of putting anything there randomly to be used with "Ctrl + f".

But if you work on this right now and if you say that the patch will be ready soon, after all.. It has been like that for so long ! 

I just updated the patch, which now does not change the depth of the combinat doc page. It still changes the depth of the posets page, but you can check there http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/posets.html that only "Classes and functions" would be removed.

Hey Nathann,

Since the re-organizing is not that close to being done (at least by what I believe your definition of close is), I'm setting this to positive review. I will create a new ticket for the reorganization of the combinatorics doc and get that posted to trac as soon as it's done.

Thanks,

Travis

Thaaaaaaaaaaanks ! I will look at your other patch too, I also want this combinat doc index to become readable eventually `:-P`
