The symptom is the error at the line `cd leon make` coming from a `Makefile` in `guava` package.

```
make[3]: Entering directory '/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/gap/gap-4.8.3/pkg/guava-3.13/src'
gcc  -O2 -L/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib  -o leonconv leonconv.c
cd leon make
/bin/sh: line 0: cd: too many arguments
make[3]: *** [Makefile:14: all] Error 1
```

See also the corresponding gentoo [github thread](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/447).

On a system I see this error, `/bin/sh` is a link to `bash`.

The build system is a right mess. 

```
SRCDIR  = ./src/leon
CJSRCDIR= ./src/ctjhai
BINDIR = bin/$(GAPARCH)
#GAP_PATH=../..
#PKG_PATH=.
#SRCDISTFILE=guava

targets: default

default: bindir minimum-weight leonconv desauto install

# this target creates a bin-directory
bindir:
	if test ! -d $(BINDIR);  then mkdir -p $(BINDIR);  fi

minimum-weight: $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf2.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf3.o $(CJSRCDIR)/popcount.o
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight \
$(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf2.o \
$(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf3.o $(CJSRCDIR)/popcount.o -lm

leonconv: 
	cd ./src; $(MAKE) CC="$(CC)" CPPFLAGS="$(CPPFLAGS)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)";

desauto: 
	cd $(SRCDIR); autoreconf --install --force || true ; ./configure; $(MAKE) CC="$(CC)" CPPFLAGS="$(CPPFLAGS)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)";
```

so the `desauto` target will produce a makefile in `src/leon` and run make. In effect that little bit in `src/Makefile` would be "useful" if the `desauto` target was run before `leonconv`. As it is, it indeed does nothing.

Which version of `bash` are you using?

With

I'm on bash 4.4.5(1) (according to manpages of bash, the args of cd after dir are ignored). If I merely use the branch I still cannot build, I need to run configure in src/leon first. I need to check that this can be replaced by adding

Considering the cruft, I would suggest more invasive changes upstream. `src/Makefile` is really full of unused stuff beside that line. Once it is done the target dependencies in the top makefile could be pushed to the `install` target only. And finally could we get rid of running `autoreconf` (note the artful way things are handled on line 29 of `Makefile.in` so that absence of `autoreconf` or its failure is not a problem - and because there is an automake statement in `src/leon/configure.ac` and no `Makefile.am`, `autoreconf` will fail if run).

I don't care.

For Sage for now, why not do the minimal change which is needed to fix the problem with bash 4.4? We can leave further changes for the future, after discussing with upstream.
