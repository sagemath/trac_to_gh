The Sage functions
* `gamma_inc_lower`
* `beta`
* `erfi`
* `elliptic_pi`
* `elliptic_e` (incomplete of 2nd kind, the interface `CBF(...).elliptic_e` actually corresponds to `elliptic_ec`
* `hurwitz_zeta`

could be computed using arb but the interface is missing.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24641

an initial wrapping of `beta(a,b)` added on #32851, with a caveat (see TODO).

Basically, `RBF(beta(a,b))` does not work, but `RBF(a).beta(b)` does.
