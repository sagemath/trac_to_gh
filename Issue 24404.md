The Sage functions
 * `gamma_inc_lower`
 * `beta`
 * `erfi`
 * `elliptic_pi`
 * `elliptic_e` (incomplete of 2nd kind, the interface `CBF(...).elliptic_e` actually corresponds to `elliptic_ec`
 * `hurwitz_zeta`

could be computed using arb but the interface is missing.

Changing keywords from "" to "arblib, CBF, RBF, ComplexBallField, RealBallField".

an initial wrapping of `beta(a,b)` added on #32851, with a caveat (see TODO).

Basically, `RBF(beta(a,b))` does not work, but `RBF(a).beta(b)` does.
