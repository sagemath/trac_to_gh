I don't know why the deprecation warning mentions #5716. It was #5997. But that's still 5 years ago.

Oh. Weird.

Well, either way I can only pray that there is nothing in the developper's manual about deprecating deprecation warnings when the ticket number is wrong `:-p`

This actually came up in the ask.sagemath questions about using lib gap recently, so good work.
