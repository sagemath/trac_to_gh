```
             sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a1')
             sage: E.point_search(5, verbose=False)
-            [(-1 : 1 : 1), (-3/4 : 7/8 : 1)]
+            [(-1 : 1 : 1), (0 : 0 : 1)]

You are using `auto_paridecl` and let me propose a citation from you

```
Vincent:
> The branch is a proposal to have an autogenerated
> cypari2/auto_paridecl.pxi that will be included in cypari2/paridecl.pxd.

Jeroen:
I would keep these two independent. Keep the old paridecl.pxd and
use the new auto_paridecl.pxd only for the auto-generated code.
```

That functions returns a set of generators of the points which were found. Both answers are correct: they are both a basis of the set of rational points.

I have to, because `paridecl.pxd` is not up-to-date. So, with the current cypari2 version, this is the only way.

Anyway, I'm fine with continuing this discussion for cypari2. But I don't think that this ticket should be blocked by that.
