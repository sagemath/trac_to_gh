Tests with FLINT 2.8.0-rc2 on #31525 show no errors (with the `arb` patch included).
So it looks like with this ticket here we will be ready for systems shipping FLINT 2.8.x.

The actual upgrade in #31525 will need more work and can be delayed to Sage 9.5.

Normally adding a patch requires a revision bump.
