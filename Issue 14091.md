# Issue 14091: Singular 3-1-5 fails to build on Solaris with GCC 4.7.x

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14295

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2013-03-18 13:08:48

Assignee: tbd

CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: ambiguous floor log10 SunOS bigintmat.cc

This is because on Solaris, a couple of C math functions get overloaded in C++ (and Solaris' math headers put them into the global namespace).

New Singular 3-1-5.p5 spkg coming up soon.

Changing keywords from "ambiguous floor log10 SunOS bigintmat.cc" to "ambiguous floor log10 SunOS bigintmat.cc spkg".

In Singular 3-1-6 (cf. #14333), there's now even one more instance of this (but in `bigintmat.cc`, too).

Although I hate Singular's trac:

Will be fixed in some future Singular release (> 3-1-6).
