Keywords: ambiguous floor log10 SunOS bigintmat.cc

This is because on Solaris, a couple of C math functions get overloaded in C++ (and Solaris' math headers put them into the global namespace).

New Singular 3-1-5.p5 spkg coming up soon.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14295
