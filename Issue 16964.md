CC:  saraedum simonking tscrim mjo

Consider this example:

```python
class A():
    def __init__(self, m):
        self._m = m
        
    @cached_method
    def m(self):
        return self._m
        
class B(A):
    def m(self):
        return A.m(self)
```

The method `m` for the class `B` overrides the method inherited from `A`, but the caching interferes with this. I'm not sure why. As a result, `B(3).m()` doesn't work.

Note that any fix should also allow for this kind of example, and also for when the new method is cached as well:

```python
class A():
    def __init__(self, m):
        self._m = m
        
    @cached_method
    def m(self):
        return self._m
        
class C(A):
    def m(self, flag=False): # signature has changed
        return A.m(self)
```

I have not looked into it in much detail, but the problem could be that `sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCallerNoArgs.__get__` does not handle the case `inst==None` correctly. It works if you don't try to get the unbound `A.m` but a bound version such as `super(B,self).m`. It seems that `A` needs to be a new-style class for this to work though:

```
sage: class A(object):                                                              
    def __init__(self, m):                                                          
        self._m = m                                                                 
    @cached_method
    def m(self):
        return self._m
....:     
sage: class B(A):                                                                   
    def m(self):
        return super(B,self).m()
....:     
sage: B(3).m()                                                                      
3
sage: class C(A):
        def m(self, flag=False): # signature has changed
                return super(C,self).m()
....:     
sage: C(3).m()
3
sage: C(3).m(True)

```


Maybe `__get__` should raise an error if `inst is None` and tell the user to do something like the above?

In a more complicated example (which arose in #16508), trying `super(B,self).m()` didn't work. I will try to construct a small example of what was going on there.

I think the issue here is that both cached methods would occupy the same slot of the instance's dict. Have you tried setting the `name` parameter of ``@`cached_method(name=…)` for one of the two?
