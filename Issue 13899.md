Implement a wrapper for tables/matrices which are indexed by arbitrary sage objects. For example, this would allow for things like

```
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: CharacterTable( DihedralGroup(4) ).display()
            Character table of Dihedral group of order 8 as a permutation group
            -------------------
               | 1a 2a 2b 4a 2a
            ---|---------------
            X0 |  1  1  1  1  1
            X1 |  1 -1 -1  1  1
            X2 |  1 -1  1 -1  1
            X3 |  1  1 -1 -1  1
            X4 |  2  0  0  0 -2
