# Issue 16540: Track pyx files in citation modules/ reorganize it

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16777

Original creator: mraum

cProfile does not track c-calls.  Google performance tools do so, hand have been wrapped up recently.  This integrates the gperftools into sage.misc.citation, reorganizes code for future development, and fixes one issue with globals. Concerning the latter, Cython was used wrongly, in as far as it's globals() are incorrect in the currenct version. The inspect module is the right way to go, guaranteed to work in future versions as well.

I removed dependence on #16778 by directly loading the profiling output.

Signal 27 = SIGTTOU? Maybe there is a signal handler race?

Also, Nathan told me that pprof sometimes dies because we don't stop profiling under certain circumstances. Might be related, though I don't know how...

I can reproduce this when letting sage -t citation.py run 100 times. I tried redirecting stdout and stderr, but this didn't fix the problem. Any ideas on how to solve this?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-08-12 12:12:31

Pprof probably mucks with the signals. Assuming that it temporarily changes the signal mask, there would be a window where SIGTTOU would come from a subprocess. Just redirecting stdin/out doesn't change the fact that there is flow control. One might try to disable TOSTOP but I think that'll just leave the race open for other signals. IMHO a better solution would be to (re-)compile Sage with Cython profiling turned on and then use CProfiler.

Comment by mraum created at 2014-08-13 06:52:05

I'm happy to change the code so that we don't use gperftools. But I don't think I have the legitimation to change global compilation parameters. I even don't know what to change so that cProfile will include pyx files.

Can you, Volker, deal with the compilation. I'll make necessary changes to the citation system in a separate ticket, if required.

While this seems subject of ongoing discussion, I have already pushed separate changes -- BibTeX facilities -- to #16854.

I have made a small commit, to change a few lines to the new docstyle continuation using `....:`

This implements the approach that was suggested by Volker, reasoning that branch prediction will avoid slow down in critical (e.g. Cython or C) code. The test suite runs, on my computer, 1.3% slower. I have also tested a more critical part, sage/rings, which runs 2.8% slower.

See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/xoPszCcMtns/Y5UYdOr-WVsJ for a discussion. As a remark, I want to say also here: If we want to have citations (which I strongly believe is a question of publication ethics), either we need the profiling approach (which does not interoperate well with the Sage ecosystem) or we have to accept a minor slow down.

Is anybody still interested in this ticket? Note that the ticket description no longer reflects the code.
