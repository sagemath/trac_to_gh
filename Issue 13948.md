# Issue 13948: Add sig_on_count() check check

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14152

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-02-20 21:59:56

Assignee: mvngu

We should add a check to check that the doctesting framework correctly checks the value of `_signals.sig_on_count`. We should also keep it in check by setting it to zero, because a non-zero value is a blank cheque for the doctester to fail every subsequent `sig_on_count()` check.
