Incredibly nitpicking thing:

```diff
+from . coerce_maps cimport (NamedConvertMap, DefaultConvertMap,
+        DefaultConvertMap_unique, CallableConvertMap)
```

The space after the `.` looks strange, but I guess that is not a syntax error (a bit to my surprise). Feel free to set a positive review if you don't care or on my behalf if tweaked.
