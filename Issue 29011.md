# Issue 29011: Index notation for tensors should allow for unicode characters

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29248

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2020-02-26 20:34:13

CC:  @lbrunswic egourgoulhon tscrim @mjungmath

Keywords: tensor, indices

In Sage 9.0, we have:

```
sage: E.<x,y> = EuclideanSpace()
sage: t = E.tensor_field(1, 1, [[x, 1], [0, y]])
sage: t['^μ_μ']
...
ValueError: index conventions not satisfied
```

Now, after the Python 3 switch, any unicode character should be accepted, see [this discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/NUWoWB7i8tw/ZMKZ7N0uCAAJ). This is especially pertinent for tensor indices, since Greek letters are often used to denote them.
