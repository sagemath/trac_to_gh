# Issue 28943: Fix bug in EdgesView

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29180

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-02-11 15:27:54

In the `__eq__` method of `EdgesView`, we forgot to check that both `EdgesView` contains the same number of edges. Consequently, we can get:

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: E = graphs.EmptyGraph()
sage: G.edges() == E.edges()
True
```


Thanks to Benoit Prigent for reporting it.
