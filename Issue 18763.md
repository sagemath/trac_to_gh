This ticket collects tickets necessary to replace Maxima `solve` with a state-of-the-art SMT-solver. The interface will be the open SMT-LIB 2.0 and so there is a wide choice of packages of which Z3 certainly is the best at the moment.

Actually I overestimated the capabilities of SMT-solvers. While nice for proving unsat/sat they have no ready-made functionality for complex numbers and Z3 does not return the full solution set but example values that satisy the assertions. But maybe I do not understand how to get this(?).

SMT is quantifier elimination with booleans. Here one really needs quantifier elimination in other, more complicated, 1st order theories (pardon the logic terminology).
While algorithms are known how to do quantifier elimination with complex and reals (assuming the only functions involved are polynomials, otherwise it's harder, or even algorithmically unsolvable), there are not really any off the shelf OSS for this.
(Sage includes `qepcad` to do this over reals, but it's not so easy to use and very slow).
