We currently have

```
sage: function('f');
sage: diff(f(x,x),x)
D[0](f)(x, x) + D[1](f)(x, x)
```

which is fine. It's even valid Python syntax. However, we do not have a definition for D available that allows this to serve as input. It's easy to define, though.

The relevant code is

```
from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
class Dclass(object):
    def __init__(self,L=None):
        if L is None:
            self.L=[]
        else:
            self.L=L
    def __getitem__(self,index):
        if isinstance(index,tuple):
            index=list(index)
        elif not(isinstance(index,list)):
            index=[index]
        return Dclass(self.L+index)
    def __call__(self,arg):
        return FDerivativeOperator(arg,self.L)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "D"+str(self.L)
D=Dclass()
```

It's a little more substantial than just a one-liner, so it probably deserves to live somewhere in the library.

Whether this binding to `D` should be in the top-level namespace is another question. Maybe? `D` isn't defined there presently. If we don't put it there, it should live in an easily importable place. Once this ticket is done, something along the lines of

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import D
sage: function('f');
sage: D[0,1](f)(x,x)
D[0, 1](f)(x, x)
sage: D[0,0](f)(x)
diff(f(x), x, x)
sage: D[0](sin)(x)
cos(x)
```

should work.
