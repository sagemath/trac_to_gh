SignalError: Illegal instruction

**********************************************************************

Oops, Sage crashed. We do our best to make it stable, but...

A crash report was automatically generated with the following information:
  - A verbatim copy of the crash traceback.
  - A copy of your input history during this session.
  - Data on your current Sage configuration.

It was left in the file named:
        '/home/Matthias Koeppe/.sage/ipython-5.0.0/Sage_crash_report.txt'
If you can email this file to the developers, the information in it will help
them in understanding and correcting the problem.

You can mail it to: sage-support at sage-support@googlegroups.com
with the subject 'Sage Crash Report'.

If you want to do it now, the following command will work (under Unix):
mail -s 'Sage Crash Report' sage-support@googlegroups.com < /home/Matthias Koeppe/.sage/ipython-5.0.0/Sage_crash_report.txt

In your email, please also include information about:
- The operating system under which the crash happened: Linux, macOS, Windows,
  other, and which exact version (for example: Ubuntu 16.04.3, macOS 10.13.2,
  Windows 10 Pro), and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit;
- How Sage was installed: using pip or conda, from GitHub, as part of
  a Docker container, or other, providing more detail if possible;
- How to reproduce the crash: what exact sequence of instructions can one
  input to get the same crash? Ideally, find a minimal yet complete sequence
  of instructions that yields the crash.

From `NTL/doc/tour-win.html`:

152 Configuration flags.

154 <p>
155 
156 Also in directory "<tt>include/NTL</tt>" is a file called "<tt>config.h</tt>".
157 You can edit this file to override some of NTL's default options
158 for basic configuration and performance.
159 Again, the defaults should be good for
160 Windows with MSVC++.
```


In `config.h` there is a couple of flags that needs to be set by hand apparently.

But one might even define those things as environment variables and this might be passed through??

What makes me thing that it might be AVX512 related, is that we haven't encountered this before. Github workflows is the only place where I encountered processors capable of AVX512.

I think `--cpu-baseline=MIN` should also be good-enough to run on the vast, vast majority of machines that are modern enough to even be capable of running Sage.

> Erik, in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/s_inhvSxLp8/m/Vtb35oYcAgAJ you say you have fixed it in the windows binary build --- what's the solution?

The issue on the NTL side was fixed: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/53

The solution was to not use the NTL package from Cygwin and custom compile it instead.

I also brought the issue up with the package maintainer: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2020-December/247196.html

He has released a new version of the package to address it: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2020-December/247205.html

He still rebuilt it, with my perhaps fault suggestion of including `CXXFLAGS=-mavx`, which others have rightfully pointed out will still make it less portable, though I think that's how I built it as well.

He released another new NTL package in January but I'm not sure whether or not it changes anything about this: https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2021-January/247439.html

The NTL fix definitely worked for some, but others are still reporting segfaults in plotting, so I think that has to do either with OpenBLAS or Numpy, but I haven't been able to gather enough details: https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/57

Do we know anything about the CPU architecture of the machines these builds are being run on?  I looked through the logs but didn't find anything.  It might be helpful to add a `cat /proc/cpuinfo` somewhere.

Thanks for looking into this -- I really need your expertise here! 

I run rebasing at the end of `.github/workflows/extract-sage-local.sh` - to make sure that the downloaded stages that have been built in parallel can work together.

If you want to do a full rebase in this step it can't be called from a shell script run with /bin/bash.  The script either needs to be run with dash, or as a separate command with dash.
