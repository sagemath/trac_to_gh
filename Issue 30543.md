Why did this include a whole entire duplicate of `setup.py`?

The duplication was done in #30779, a dependency of this ticket. This is preparing for Tobias Diez's work for editable installs (`setup.py develop`) in #30371 out of `src/` and the work in #29705 regarding modularization, which is taking place in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src`. At some point they will be reconciled again, but for the time being it simplifies development to keep the two copies separate.
