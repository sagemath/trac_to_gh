Seems like it. Unfortunately I won’t be back to my desktop for another week (due to travel) to push the changes. I can do it then, but there were 3 changes:

1. Add `tensor_algebra` under the free algebras.
2. Remove a stray `’` from the quantum Clifford in the algebras catalog.
3. Give the correct module or class for the alternating central extension in the catalog.

looks good, found one typo in tensor_algebra:

```
Return the empty word, which indexes of 1 of this algebra.
```

should be

```
Return the empty word, which indexes the 1 of this algebra.
```

After fixing that, you can set to positive
