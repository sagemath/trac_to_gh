Seems like it. Unfortunately I won’t be back to my desktop for another week (due to travel) to push the changes. I can do it then, but there were 3 changes:

1. Add `tensor_algebra` under the free algebras.
2. Remove a stray `’` from the quantum Clifford in the algebras catalog.
3. Give the correct module or class for the alternating central extension in the catalog.
