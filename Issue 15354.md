sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
sage: sum([T(1), T(1), T(2)])
0
sage: T.sum([T(1), T(1), T(2)])

I'm not sure if this is caused by #15163 and I don't have time to check :/

I don't think so, and here's what I believe to be why. The first one starts at 0, which is then converted into a tropical 0, and then summed. The second starts at `T.zero()` (which is not [a tropical] 0 but `+infinity`). I don't think we'd ever find a way to fix this, so the best we could hope for is a very big warning message.

Could you write that BIG WARNING MESSAGE along with a warning to not trust existing code unless it has been checked for tropical safety? (There's also the ``TT(0)`` and ``TT(1)`` issue.) Thanks a lot.
