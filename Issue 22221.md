It worries me a lot that Thebe upstream did not show any activity since May 2016 (for example, a trivial pull request from June 2016 was not merged). Is the project dead?

I am not much surprised: it's likely that, once JupyterLab is out, Thebe will become just a thin library on top of it. So I can see the lack of motivation for doing just light maintenance on it.
But of course if it's completely broken and nothing happens, that's not good.
