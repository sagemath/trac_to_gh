It worries me a lot that Thebe upstream did not show any activity since May 2016 (for example, a trivial pull request from June 2016 was not merged). Is the project dead?

I am not much surprised: it's likely that, once JupyterLab is out, Thebe will become just a thin library on top of it. So I can see the lack of motivation for doing just light maintenance on it.
But of course if it's completely broken and nothing happens, that's not good.

Just saw this, you disabled XSRF protection on a potentially internet facing service that allows for arbitrary code execution. This needs to be fixed asap...
