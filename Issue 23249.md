I looked at this from a functionality perspective as opposed to looking through the algorithm line by line.

All of the examples I was able to come up with behaved as expected, so I just have a few minor issues

- 2 doc test failures

```
sage -t --warn-long 72.0 rings/laurent_series_ring.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 72.0 rings/padics/tests.py  # 1 doctest failed
```


- in a couple places you say

```
if `d_i` denotes the `(i,i)` entry of `D`
```

I think you means `D` to be `S`

- extra word

```
'it is possible to do not'
```


- in several places you say 'also possible for rectangular matrices' where you mean 'nonrectangular'

- in two different places for echelon form you state it as find the Smith normal form instead of the echelon form

```
to determine the Smith normal form
```


- is there a reason to assign

```
    else:
        left = right = None
```

they don't seem to be used later.

- incorrect word


```
integer this of this
```

should be 'integer ring of this'

Thanks for your comments.

I fixed the wording.
The failing doctests were due to the fact that, in the case of a matrix M defined over a complete discrete valuation *field* K, my function `echelon_form()` did not compute the row-echelon from of M over K but over its ring of integers (i.e. the transformation matrix has coefficients in the ring of integers and is invertible over it). I then changed the name for `integral_echelon_from()`.

NB: Some of your comments are related to ticket #23450. Maybe you should look at this one as well.

The computation of transformation matrices, I think.

Moreover, for matrices over Qp, it makes sense to have an option for computing the echelon form over Zp (that is, without renormalizing the pivots) in order to save precision. But I don't think that it's implemented in this ticket.

- `smith_form` calls the method `_matrix_smith_form` of the base ring; concretely, this method is implemented in the class `sage.rings.padics.local_generic.LocalGeneric`

I followed the third approach: I put everything in the category and put the code in a separate `pyx` file. So far, most of the code is written in pure python; maybe we should move to cython at some point.

There is some code duplication due to the fact that we have separate categories for discrete valuation rings and fields but not a common category for both.

Anyway, everything is supposed over all types of p-adics as well as over power series and Laurent series rings. Moreover, with the general machinery already provided by sage, this is enough to manipulate free modules over those rings, including then lattices in finite dimensional p-adic vector spaces.

I fixed the doctest failures, except the one in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py` because I can't understand the relation with this ticket. Any idea?

Oh, it's just because I removed the function `__contains__` in `sage.rings.power_series_ring`.

However, this function didn't work as expected. Typically, we had:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[[]]
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: K(t) in R
False
```


Falling back to the generic implementation of `__contains__`, this problem disappears but an element in `Z/2Z[This is the Trac macro *u* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#u-macro)` is considered as belonging to `Z[This is the Trac macro *u* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#u-macro)`. It's certainly not mathematically correct but the same holds for polynomials. So I'm not sure if it's better to fix the bug (I don't expect this to be easy) or the doctest.

I think this is just a consequence of Sage's longstanding definition of containment.  It's analogous to

```
sage: mod(3, 7) in ZZ

So I would say that restoring the generic behavior for containment is correct.
