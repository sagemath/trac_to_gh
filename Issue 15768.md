As reported by Marc in #15978, `iterator_edges` wastes a lot of time. Computationally, returning all edges of a graph currently works this way:


```
for each edge E of the graph: # Okay, linear time
    <Something equivalent to checking that E is an edge> # Totally useless
    return E

```


This can be solved by creating a function that is somehow between 
- Returning all neighbors of a vertex (which is not sufficient to find the edges incident to this vertex)
- Work directly with the data structure, i.e. a binary tree

This function is named `out_neighbors_BTNode_unsafe` and does what some part of the code already did, before throwing the information away. It builds the list of `BTNodes` describing the [neighbors of/edges incident to] a vertex, from which all that we need can be deduced.

As a result, the useless computations reported above can be removed.

Hi Nathann,

Some old timings

```
sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: timeit('for e in g.edge_iterator(): pass')
5 loops, best of 3: 684 ms per loop
```

Some new timings

```
sage: g=graphs.RandomGNP(1500,.4)
sage: timeit('for e in g.edge_iterator(): pass')
5 loops, best of 3: 317 ms per loop
```

This is definitely cool!

Question for further optimization: why in the `SparseGraphBackend` the methods `iterator_edges`, `iterator_in_edges` and `iterator_out_edges` do not use the `out_neighbors_unsafe`/`in_neighbors_unsafe` of `SparseGraph` with an array `int * neighbors` allocated once for all to the maximum of the degrees? That would avoid as many "malloc"+"list creation" as there are number of vertices in the call.

Hi Nathann,

I update the branch to sage.6.2.rc0 and implement what I said. There is still one `sage_malloc` that can be avoided in `out_neighbors_BTNode_unsafe` (it is documented in a `TODO` bloc). The timings are a bit better with this new implementation. Please have a look.

My commit is mainly documentation, and the code is copy/paste of the very same 10 lines... so I do not agree with "You wrote a lot of code". Did you read it or ran

```
if [ $(git log -p -1|grep ^[\+-]|wc -l) -ge 300 ];
   then echo "This f******g patch is toooooooo long";
fi
```

But for sure I agree that there are some design discussions to have. The follow up is in #16220.

More seriously, there are many malformations in the documentation (especially the INPUT/OUTPUT blocks). They concern cdef functions so as soon as only the reference manual is concerned everything is fine.

Good enough for positive review.

Well, by just reading it I did not get immediately that it was only copy/paste. And it is code that should be looked at carefully. Don't worry, in the Graph realm it is not because something is settled "in a different ticket" that it is buried forever.

Yepyep. I'll go there next, though I believe I still have some answers to give you on other tickets.
