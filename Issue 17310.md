The attempt to create a symbolic function that prints with a name that is also used by a reserved GiNaC function results in unexpected behaviour when evaluating. The following should output `x^2` but completely bypasses `AFunction.eval`:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
sage: class AFunction(BuiltinFunction):
....:       def __init__(self, name, exp=1):
....:           self.exponent=exp
....:           BuiltinFunction.__init__(self, name, nargs=1)
....:       def _eval_(self, arg):
....:               return arg**self.exponent
sage: p2 = AFunction('exp', 2)
sage: p2(x)
e^x
```
If the name is however e.g. `p2` then `AFunction.eval` gets called as expected. Compare the above with

```
...
sage: p2 = AFunction('p2', 2)
sage: p2(x)
x^2
```
This prevents creation of `BuiltinFunction`s as wrapper for functions reserved by Pynac with the same name like `factorial` (#17489), and forces every change into Pynac.

I came to this from #17489 when I tried to create a symbolic `factorial` function without usage of `GinacFunction`, which wreaks havoc when expression conversion to/from e.g. Maxima is involved.

I don't understand the problem, what's wrong?

If the name is e.g. `p2` `AFunction.eval` gets called, but not with name equal to a function provided with GiNaC. Compare the above with

```
...
sage: p2 = AFunction('p2', 2)
sage: p2(x)
x^2
