Although the 32-bit SPARC version of Sage passes all doc tests, there are still issues on 32-bit versions of Solaris/OpenSolaris on x86 hardware. This ticket summaries lists only failures on 32-bit builds, versions on x86 processors. 

64-bit versions have far more failures, and will need another ticket to address them.

I discovered the GFAN issues were a mistake on my part, so #9736 was closed as invalid, and those doctest failures can be ignored.
