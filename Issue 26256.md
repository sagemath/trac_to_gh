The PARI "clone" functionality is pretty close to what `deepcopy_to_python_heap()` does. Since it's handling PARI objects anyway, it makes sense to use the PARI `gclone()` functionality too.

That is what cypari2 will do starting from version 2.0, so for consistency `element_pari_ffelt` should do that too.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26493

Replying to [comment:9 pbruin]:
> It does seem to imply that `copy` will make a new Python object containing a reference to the same PARI object

Exactly. But finite field elements are immutable (you cannot change them in-place, neither in PARI nor in Sage), so that should not be a problem.
