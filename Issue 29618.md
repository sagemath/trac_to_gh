# Issue 29618: sagelib setup.py: Fix dependencies on header files of packages gmp, ntl

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29855

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-06-14 05:30:18

CC:  mjo @kliem fbissey dimpase jhpalmieri

These header file locations (for use in Cython dependencies only) are currently hardcoded as living in `SAGE_INC`, which is no longer true.

This is a step toward #29711, and also preparation for #29847 because it removes use of `sage.env.SAGE_INC`.

This ticket is only the last commit? Or should I look at more commits?

Hum, you even said so in an earlier. Must be post lunch fatigue :)

LGTM this is much cleaner and much more appropriate.

I really have the feeling that you are breaking sage apart to rebuild it. And I am not complaining.

I hadn't spotted that! So, they need to be dictionaries?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-24 01:42:20

the values of that dictionary must be lists.

I feel especially stupid to have missed the syntax the first time so I think it should be fair for someone else to check.
