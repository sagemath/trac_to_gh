Slightly differently, after

```
export MAKE="make -j16"
export V=0
```

The command `./sage -br` fails with the same error:

```
/bin/sh: @cd: command not found
```

Unsetting `V` eliminates the problem.

This is on [SageMath](SageMath) 9.6.rc1.

The fix works for me. I would like `@`gh-GMS103 to test it, too.
