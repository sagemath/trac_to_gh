We have the following bug:


```
sage: P = QQ[x]
sage: P in Modules(QQ)
True
sage: P in Modules(P)
False
sage: Modules(P)(P)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError:
```


but on the other hand


```
sage: P^1 in Modules(P)
True
```


works.

Something to document rather than to fix, if you ask me.

Similarly, a field is not in the category of vector spaces
even though it is a vector space over itself.

I don't consider this to be a bug, but a consequence of how we often secretly equate things in mathematics. `QQ` doesn't know it is a 1-dimensional module because it doesn't know how to do linear algebra (albeit it is trivial). So I also believe it should be documented and does not need a fix.

It seems like you just need to be a little more careful with what objects you are working with if you want it to be a module morphism (rather than an action).

But that doesn't answer my question how I can define a morphism (i.e. module homomorphism) from a ring to a module over the same ring. This must be somehow possible in Sage.

Fine, this works with `QQ` when you convert it into a vector space via `QQ^1` but this trick *doesn't* work for e.g. scalar fields anymore.

As far as I know, you can't, unfortunately. And I don't think there is a need to change anything or add this features. The only thing I need is a module homomorphism starting/ending from/to the scalar field algebra. It's really annoying that this is not working...

making each ring a module over itself.

If you want a more hack way around it, you can modify the `__contains__` for the modules.

That sounds more like a problem with the implementation of scalar fields because the free module code should work with any field as linear algebra works over any field. Note that `QQ^1` is just syntactic sugar for `FreeModule(QQ, 1)`.

I have another idea. I think, we need a `__pow__` method for general parents that delegate to `_pow_` in the categories. So far, the method `_pow_int` in `categories.fields` has no purpose at all.

Then we deal with the coercion via `self**1`.

The reason is that for example


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: A = M.scalar_field_algebra()
sage: FreeModule(A, 1)
```


won't work otherwise. Rings that do not inherit from `ring.pyx` don't admit the necessary methods. Perhaps it is a better idea to move all those methods to the category...?

As for perma-nailing, that wasn't my idea. It happens everywhere in the code.

There are good solutions for that: Rather than `Modules(QQ)` use `Modules(Fields())`. The base ring can be obtained from the object itself anyway, so it doesn't need to be stored on its category.

This has caused real computational failures in CRT-based computations (there are a lot of finite fields ...), so this is not some theoretical problem.\n\nIt may well be that subsequent developers were not aware of the real issues addressed in #15801 and, inspired by a desire for mathematical precision, have reintroduced automatic instantiation of parametrized categories.

One should indeed try to avoid instantiating instanced of parametrized categories (such as categories that have a base ring and/or dimensions) because they can lead to unbounded memory use over time.

See #15801. There are good solutions for that: Rather than `Modules(QQ)` use `Modules(Fields())`. The base ring can be obtained from the object itself anyway, so it doesn't need to be stored on its category. Note that objects can have their category "refined", so `Modules(QQ)` can still be instantiated if absolutely wanted by the user, and then an object can be made to have that category. The system shouldn't instantiate those categories uninvited, though. This has caused real computational failures in CRT-based computations (there are a lot of finite fields ...), so this is not some theoretical problem.

It may well be that subsequent developers were not aware of the real issues addressed in #15801 and, inspired by a desire for mathematical precision, have reintroduced automatic instantiation of parametrized categories. These are bugs that should be corrected.

Then add these methods to make it work as it suggests an incomplete implementation.

Then import it from those locations because if we decide to stop nailing it in, then we only have to change it in one place and then fix the errors in all of the files. Do not nail anything more than what already is done. Just because it is done elsewhere does not make it a good practice.

Either way: the category `Rings` must be refactored then. If a ring must have these methods, this must be stated in the category, e.g. via abstract methods or halfway implementations. See #31722.

That can be done in #31722.

If I recall correctly, categories are fundamentally immortal once they participate in the dynamic classes that are derived from them (isn't this always?) The category hierarchy is just too involved to be reliably fully dynamic (in the sense that parts of it can be removed and garbage collected).

I suspect that this might be rather fundamental: once you participate in Python's MRO inheritance mechanism, you'd probably already get permanently nailed there. Python is definitely not designed with a non-monotonously growing class hierarchy in mind, so I expect that the caching and storing strategies put in place to implement it, prevent decreases (by "accidental design" I expect -- as a consequence of other design decisions made; not as an intentional design goal)

This was implicitly acknowledged in #15801.

We suffer from similar effects in the coercion network and the conversion caching: it's just very hard to keep a graph in such a way that you can efficiently find paths and force path independence of other properties along these paths (the coercion maps; unambiguous inheritance) and still allow for nodes to vanish from the graph as well - in particular if you'd like independence to hold through time (at least limited to a run) as well.
