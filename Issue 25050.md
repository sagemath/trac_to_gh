It looks like computing multivariate gcds over ℤ is (now?) supported by Singular: no need to perform a costly reduction to polynomials over ℚ.

Works as advertised and also seems to be supported according to the Singular docs: https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-3/sing_304.htm). Positive review.

See #25313 for an analogous change to `_floordiv_`.
