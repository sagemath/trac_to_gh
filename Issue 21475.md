Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2016-10-15 21:39:52

E.g. resizing a terminal while file is attached crashes with

```
  File "/mnt/disk/home/release/Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/inputhook.py", line 34, in sage_inputhook
    r, w, e = select.select([f], [], [], TIMEOUT)
select.error: (4, 'Interrupted system call')
```
