# Issue 33189: add more details on conda-based installations of Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33426

Original creator: dimpase

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#sec-installation-conda

assumes knowledge about Conda. In fact, we have enough details
on https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda, but the link to it is only given
at the bottom of https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#sec-installation-conda, and only in context of "Instructions for using Conda for [SageMath](SageMath) development"

This should be fixed, and some parts of wiki copied there.

We should also mention the sagemath-forge Conda channel
whose base environment has Sage.

Changing keywords from "" to "conda".

I don't know about it - can you add it somewhere - maybe on the wiki?

I also like the way scipy is doing it with having a very brief
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickerstart_conda.html#quickerstart-conda
quickstart, and a more detailed explanation
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickstart_ubuntu.html#quickstart-ubuntu

The link on the index page still goes to the wiki, which should be probably changed now that the relevant instructions are migrated. https://516701dbc7dd9738fb9d77ee3ac210c3919c8cb3--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/index.html

Thanks, I've put this on the list of things to do in #33088 as a follow-up.
