Keywords: conda

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#sec-installation-conda

assumes knowledge about Conda. In fact, we have enough details
on https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda, but the link to it is only given
at the bottom of https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#sec-installation-conda, and only in context of "Instructions for using Conda for [SageMath](SageMath) development"

This should be fixed, and some parts of wiki copied there.

Also add how to update the conda environment later:
`conda env update --file src/environment.yml --prune`
