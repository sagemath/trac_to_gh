Currently, the class `FormalPolyhedraModule` does not check the dimensions of the inputted polyhedra. For example:


```
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.modules.formal_polyhedra_module import FormalPolyhedraModule
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(1)
sage: Q = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: R = polytopes.hypercube(3)
sage: M = FormalPolyhedraModule(QQ,2,[P, Q, R]); M
Free module generated by {A 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices, A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices, A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices} over Rational Field
```


Want: The construction should return an error when trying to use polyhedra not fitting the ambient dimension.
