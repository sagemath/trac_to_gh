On some systems, Debian for example, we see this failure with Python 3:

```
Failed example:

I installed a Debian virtual machine, and now I can see this error.

This problem does not seem related to the particular doctest: if I remove lots of other doctests from that file but keep this one, the error goes away. If I instead keep the file intact and add some print statements, the error is printed as this line is executed:

```
return PermutationGroup(H)
```

`PermutationGroup` has nothing to do with flint, I think.

Any ideas how to debug this?

Well, actually it is reported as failed in

Is this the "reference patchbot" for Python 3 Sage? If yes, then the table of #28298 must be updated.

Would it help to file an issue or a pull request at https://github.com/wbhart/flint2. There are numerous locations in the `trunk` branch where code had been added of the type

```
flint_print("...");
fflush(stdout);
```

Then again adding a `fflush` to `memory_manager.c` may be too trivial a change prior to a major release.

Replying to [comment:26 jhpalmieri]:
> I created a [pull request](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/585),

The FLINT repo is active, and has
[a roadmap for FLINT 2.6.0](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/517),
itself part of
[the Oscar roadmap](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl/issues/1),
so there are reasons to hope.
