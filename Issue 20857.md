Split out from the larger ticket #10879. This ticket just adds an spkg, not the Cython interface.

"SCIP is currently one of the fastest non-commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. It is also a framework for Constraint Integer Programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows total control of the solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of the solver." -- http://scip.zib.de/

Features interesting to Sage:

* SCIP is pretty fast for Mixed Integer Programming
* SCIP is a Constraint Integer Programming solver and allows non-linear constraints
* SCIP's source code is available
* SoPlex (the LP solver which is part of scipoptsuite) has an exact mode which is said to be working well
* A beta version of SCIP can do exact MIP: http://scip.zib.de/#exact using qsopt_ex (see also #18766)

However, the SCIP license prevents us from redistributing the SCIP source code:
http://scip.zib.de/#license

To build a SCIP for Sage do:

* pull from this ticket
* download the SCIP Optimisation Suite from http://scip.zib.de/download.php?fname=scipoptsuite-3.2.1.tgz
* put tarfile scipoptsuite-3.2.1.tgz in `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`
* `sage -f scipoptsuite`


Follow-up: #21003: Add SCIP backend using PySCIPOpt

Besides this, if the package has successfully been built on Linux and OS X, that is sufficient for me to have positive_review.

Matthias, have you asked SCIP whether or not we could host the tarball on our mirrors and/or have Sage have some kind of automatic download of the tarball (but not hosted on our mirrors)?

OK, done.

OK, could you take a look at #21151, which I have marked as a dependency - it's a minor update to TOPCOM so that it still installs when  scipoptsuite has been installed.

We can't even set it up so that running `sage -i scipoptsuite` automatically goes through and does the download?

As per http://listserv.zib.de/pipermail/scip/2015-July/002448.html :
  Q: Users could "download and install" this copy by running "sage -i scip"
 
  A: In this case you would have to ensure that people notice and acknowledge that
  they use SCIP under the Academic License, which excludes any commercial
  usage.

So some kind of license display and acknowledgement prompt could be done. I don't want to work on this, though. If you want to add this, please make a follow-up ticket.

SCIPoptsuite itself is a "distribution", consisting of SoPlex, SCIP, and other packages, whose tar.gz files are included in the tarball of SCIPoptsuite. (Not all of these packages have a separate upstream download.)

The patches are relative to the `scip` subdirectory that is created after unpacking the included SCIP tar.gz. They are generated from a git repository of SCIP.
