For small posets: after, one gets

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 623 µs, sys: 7 µs, total: 630 µs
Wall time: 634 µs
```

and before, one got

```
sage: sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
....: sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
....: sage: %time H.lequal_matrix()
....: 
CPU times: user 328 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 328 µs
Wall time: 332 µs
```

so there is a loss here.

For larger posets, there is a gain. This needs to be investigated.

So there is now a small progress in that case.

Thanks, Travis. Did you make any timings, just to be sure ? I am slightly uncertain whether this is a general speedup of posets.

I noticed some mild speedups across the board:

Before:

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 1.23 ms, sys: 158 µs, total: 1.39 ms
Wall time: 1.28 ms

sage: P = posets.CoxeterGroupAbsoluteOrderPoset(CoxeterGroup(['B',4]))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 65.2 ms, sys: 4.05 ms, total: 69.2 ms
Wall time: 64 ms

sage: P = posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset(6)
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 966 ms, sys: 36.3 ms, total: 1 s
Wall time: 981 ms
```

After:

```
sage: P = posets.NoncrossingPartitions(SymmetricGroup(4))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 1.11 ms, sys: 105 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 1.05 ms

sage: P = posets.CoxeterGroupAbsoluteOrderPoset(CoxeterGroup(['B',4]))
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time _ = H.lequal_matrix()
CPU times: user 67.4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 67.4 ms
Wall time: 63.8 ms

sage: P = posets.SymmetricGroupBruhatOrderPoset(6)
