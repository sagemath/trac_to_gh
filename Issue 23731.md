This meta ticket keeps track of all the tickets related to IntegralLattice development.
Here a lattice is a ZZ-Module L isomorphic to ZZ^n, equipped with a non-degenerate, symmetric bilinear form L x L --> ZZ.

- #23576 bug in vector matrix multiplication for free module elements
- #23699 base class for torsion quadratic modules
- #23958 allow the inner product to take value in rings different from the base ring.
- #23955 bug in the Genus class
- #23916 print a genus using the Conway Sloane symbols
- #23376 bug in genera equality testing
- #23915 use the `inner_product_matrix` to compare ambient spaces
- #23634 a class for `IntegralLattice`es
- #22720 bug in `annihilator()` for the trivial abelian group
- #23944 QQ/ZZ, QQ/2ZZ or QQ/nZZ as abelian groups.
