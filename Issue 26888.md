Fix failing doctests with Python3 in `apex_vertices`, `coloring` and `matching`.


```
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 2057, in sage.graphs.graph.Graph.apex_vertices
Failed example:
    G.apex_vertices()
Expected:
    ['x', (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1)]
Got:
    ['x', (1, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2)]
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 4158, in sage.graphs.graph.Graph.coloring
Failed example:
    P = G.coloring(algorithm="DLX"); P
Expected:
    [[1, 2, 3], [0, 5, 6], [4]]
Got:
    [[0, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [4]]
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 4458, in sage.graphs.graph.Graph.?
Failed example:
    g.matching(algorithm="LP")
Expected:
    [(2, 3, -5), (0, 1, 0)]
Got:
    [(0, 1, 0), (2, 3, -5)]
