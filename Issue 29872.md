Our interfaces should still work if Sage finds them installed separately.

Macaulay2 and its interface certainly are maintained, not sure about Kash.

I added a link to the kash web page (http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/kash.html), but that page says it hasn't been changed since 2008. So I'm not very confident that it will work, and the top of our file `interfaces/kash.py` says "It is not enough to just have KASH installed on your computer", whatever that means.
