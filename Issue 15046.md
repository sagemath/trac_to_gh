Keywords: posets, rowmotion, sage-combinat, panyushev, order-ideals, categories

This patch adds documentation to some rowmotion-related methods in `sage/categories/posets.py` and `sage/categories/finite_posets.py` and introduces new methods which return iterators over single rowmotion / Panyushev complementation / toggle orbits instead of computing *all* orbits at once and returning them as lists. This allows experimenting with big posets (at least if one can find a way to more or less randomly sample order ideals or antichains).

Helloooooooooooooooooooooo !!

I read this patch and even though I am not from the field I feel that it could get in. I  only have some small remarks to make :

* Could the Poset class need a `.is_antichain(vertices=[...])` method to check if this set of vertices induces an antichain ? You have a `.is_chain()` method, but it does not take any argument.
* ```panyushev_complement``` should be `:meth:`panyushev_complement``
* isn't "generated by the antichain `antichain`, represented by its generating antichain" slightly redundant ? `:-P`
* With my first reading, I understood ``toggling_orbit_iter`` would take a set and a list of points, and return the toggle of the set with the first point, then this new set toggled with the second point, then this new set with the third point, ... I does not make much sense it is true, especially with ``stop=True``, but if you think somebody from the field could make the same mistake perhaps it could be made clearer `:-)`

Hi Nathannnnn and thanks for the comments!

Replying to [comment:2 ncohen]:
> * Could the Poset class need a `.is_antichain(vertices=[...])` method to check if this set of vertices induces an antichain ? You have a `.is_chain()` method, but it does not take any argument.

Probably, but I am not sure about adding such methods. `.is_chain` would have to then be given two meanings, which people might not be happy about.

> * ```panyushev_complement``` should be `:meth:`panyushev_complement``

Done.

> * isn't "generated by the antichain `antichain`, represented by its generating antichain" slightly redundant ? `:-P`

I think I've improved this sentence now.

> * With my first reading, I understood ``toggling_orbit_iter`` would take a set and a list of points, and return the toggle of the set with the first point, then this new set toggled with the second point, then this new set with the third point, ... I does not make much sense it is true, especially with ``stop=True``, but if you think somebody from the field could make the same mistake perhaps it could be made clearer `:-)`

Good point -- added a warning!

Since I forgot to qnew, I've made the changes in my old patch rather than adding a new patch. I hope this is fine, and I'll just update the old patch and upload the new changes as a txt file.

Well, the meaning of `is_chain` stays the same when used without argument, and a feature is added. Better than creating a `is_chain_subset` method to do the very same, and if people often check whether a set is a chain or an antichain, it can be useful.

Right. Now that I think of it, though, it can be implemented better :
* Check that an ordered list is indeed a chain : only `n-1` comparisons
* Check that a set is indeed a chain : quicksort using `n log(n)` comparisons, then check if the (ordered) result makes sense with `n-1` comparisons.

Anyway, if this function is useful at some point it can still be implemented in a `.is_chain` method with a `vertices=[...]` argument (possibly equal to `None` to mean "self") and a `ordered=True` parameter for this second problem `:-D`

Hellooooo again !

Hmmmm... I don't get why you needed this hack, actually. What's wrong with the following ?

`sorted_o = sorted(o, cmp=self.lt)`

If the set is a chain then it behaves exactly as a quicksort, and otherwise `.lt` will answer "no" from time to time -- but who cares, you will find this out in the terminal check :

`all(self.lt(x[i],x[i+1]) for i in range(len(o))-1)`

And I still believe that this would be better in side of `Poset.is_chain()` `:-P`

Aaaaaaand Nicolas did not think that it would be a problem but well... That's up to you `:-P`

I don't think `self.lt` returns the right format for `sorted`. It seems that the `cmp` keyword of `sorted` wants a total -1,0,1-valued function, not a boolean one. See how this prints the same list twice:

```
P = Poset({i: divisors(i) for i in divisors(24)})
print sorted(list(P), cmp=P.lt)
print sorted(list(P), cmp=P.gt)
```


And either way, I don't know how `sorted` would react if `cmp` fails to be antisymmetric, i. e., if there are two distinct elements which compare as equal or each smaller than the other. I'd hope the result would still be sorted, but who knows? Why is there no good doc for `sorted`??

      checks whether the vertices of ``verts`` are totally ordered in 
      the poset. If ``ordered`` is set to ``False`` (default), checks 
      whether these vertices are totally ordered with the ordering 
      given by the list ``verts``

Replying to [comment:10 darij]:
> I don't think `self.lt` returns the right format for `sorted`. It seems that the `cmp` keyword of `sorted` wants a total -1,0,1-valued function, not a boolean one. See how this prints the same list twice:

The recommended way is to use `sorted(...,key=...)` where `key` should map the sequence elements into a totally ordered set (for instance, the integers). This provides a concise way of the decorate-sort-undecorate pattern, or *Schwartzian transform*, which is generally more efficient than sorting with a likely expensive custom sort function.

The `cmp` keyword is actually removed in Python 3. See `functools.cmp_to_key` to convert a legitimate `cmp` function into a value suitable for `key`.

Thanks, Nathann and Nils, for your comments. I've decided to provide two implementations for `is_chain`, one using sorting when the poset is finite (in which case, as Nils suggests, I'll use a `key` attribute), one by checking all pairs of possible relations when the poset is not assumed finite.

I'm still reluctant to make this part of the existing `is_chain` method. One reason is that the existing `is_chain` exists only for finite posets, so I'd have to move it from `sage/combinat/posets.py` to `sage/categories/posets.py` and give it some stupid error behavior when the poset is not finite.

I'm carrying this over into a new ticket: #15322. Please disregard the additions-dg.patch I posted here, as it is buggy.
