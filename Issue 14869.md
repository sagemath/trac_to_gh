I'd like to be able to do the following from within the directory of a spkg:

```
sage --spkg .   # current directory
```

but that doesn't work properly (it would create a file `..spkg`).

Therefore, I propose that

```
sage --spkg DIR
```

first does a `cd DIR/..` and then creates the package from there.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15106
