# Issue 14869: Allow sage --spkg from a different directory

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I'd like to be able to do the following from within the directory of a spkg:

```
sage --spkg .   # current directory
```

but that doesn't work properly (it would create a file `..spkg`).

Therefore, I propose that

```
sage --spkg DIR
```

first does a `cd DIR/..` and then creates the package from there.

Should be closed since sage-pkg is obsolete.
