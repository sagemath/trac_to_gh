CC:  @fchapoton @slel

Keywords: beginner, typo

Let us fix mistaken cases of doubled words in the documentation.

Find a lot of doubled words (some legitimate, some typos) with:

```
$ WORDS="a an for from if in is it of over that the then to we"
$ for word in $WORDS ; do git grep " $word $word " . ; done
```


Some (not all) instances of "a an" or "an a" also need fixing:

```
$ git grep " a an" .
$ git grep " an a" .
```

I think this would be a good one to use in a tutorial on contributing to Sage in a couple weeks, so I can supervise fixing this there if no one is already working on it.
