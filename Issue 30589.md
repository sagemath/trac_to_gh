# Issue 30589: Fix doubled word typos

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30826

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2020-10-25 13:50:45

CC:  chapoton slelievre

Keywords: beginner, typo

Let us fix mistaken cases of doubled words in the documentation.

Find a lot of doubled words (some legitimate, some typos) with:

```
$ WORDS="a an for from if in is it of over that the then to we"
$ for word in $WORDS ; do git grep " $word $word " . ; done
```


Some (not all) instances of "a an" or "an a" also need fixing:

```
$ git grep " a an" .
$ git grep " an a" .
```

I think this would be a good one to use in a tutorial on contributing to Sage in a couple weeks, so I can supervise fixing this there if no one is already working on it.

Thanks for fixing these mistakes.  However, in the following three cases, "that that" should _not_ have been changed to "that". If you do not want to revert these changes, you could instead change "that that" to "that this".

Also, although it is not within the scope of this ticket, would you be willing to make an additional grammatical correction? In the following snippet, "This modules wraps a C code" should be changed to "This module wraps C code"

Sure, I can update those. I don't really like the "that that" construction even if it is grammatically correct, so I found alternatives for most of them. Let me know if you think I mangled the meaning in any of them.

The fixes to "that that" are fine. However, in the other grammatical correction, please change "modules" to "module". (It needs to be singular, not plural.)
