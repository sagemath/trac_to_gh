We use `_circle_embedding` whenever possible in `sage.graphs.generators.smallgraphs` instead of local computation of positions. The embedding are preserved.

We could also change `_circle_embedding(list(range(...)))` to `_circle_embedding(range(...))`, but it might be best to do it in another ticket.
