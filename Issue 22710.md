I only found one: "creating a elements" -> "creating an elements", which already have an error. Something else?

For example, it should be `a Euclidean` as the initial sound is not one of the standard vowel sounds. Yes, English has many exceptions, but in this case, it is because it is much more natural to say `a` instead of `an`. (This is always a good guiding principle for which to use.)

There is also an error here `for an another submodule` (removing the `an` in this case).

OK, then it not meaningful for me to do this. I mark this as *wontfix*.

Currently there is 20 times "an Euclidean" and 6 times "a Euclidean", so even numbers don't help me.

I have a better idea.

I make a list of words used with both 'a' and 'an' article and put it to web page. Then some native english speaker selects those that should have 'a' and put that list on web. Then I make the patch, and we just ignore those lines where an error is translated to another error.
