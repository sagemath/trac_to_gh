This needs to be manually checked, some instances should be corrected by hand.

I only found one: "creating a elements" -> "creating an elements", which already have an error. Something else?

For example, it should be `a Euclidean` as the initial sound is not one of the standard vowel sounds. Yes, English has many exceptions, but in this case, it is because it is much more natural to say `a` instead of `an`. (This is always a good guiding principle for which to use.)

There is also an error here `for an another submodule` (removing the `an` in this case).

OK, then it not meaningful for me to do this. I mark this as _wontfix_.

Currently there is 20 times "an Euclidean" and 6 times "a Euclidean", so even numbers don't help me.

No, I think it is always a good thing to try and improve the documentation. Do you think you could easily modify your script to fix the Euclidean issue?

I have a better idea.

I make a list of words used with both 'a' and 'an' article and put it to web page. Then some native english speaker selects those that should have 'a' and put that list on web. Then I make the patch, and we just ignore those lines where an error is translated to another error.

The list would be something like 100..300 words I guess. It should be quite easy for a native speaker to read.

This was faster than I think: http://www.sis.uta.fi/~jm58660/a-an.txt

Any volunteers on this? Should not be that big job to do.

I think at this point the best thing to do is just change all `an Euclidean` to `a Euclidean` and positively review this ticket (and fixing the one grammatical error noted in comment:4). I don't think we are quite at the point in time where we should do this systematically, i.e., there are more important things for us to spend time on.

As you wish.

(But it is not a big job, if someone later wants to do the categorization of "a" vs. "an" words.)

Thanks I'm just feeling a little lazy about doing this... Please don't hold that against me. :P

You are already doing much more for Sage than I am.

Thanks for review.
