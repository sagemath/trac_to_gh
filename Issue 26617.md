# Issue 26617: Test for certificates in finite posets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26854

An error reported in #26847 shows that tests in `src/sage/tests/finite_poset.py` do not check that `.some_function(certificate=True)` returns a pair and `.some_function(certificate=True)[0]` is always equal to `.some_function()`

How to do this automatically and be py3-compatible? With


```
'certificate' in inspect.getargspec(LatticePoset().is_subdirectly_reducible).args
```


I can see that there is a certificate-option, but "Python 3.5+ recommends inspect.signature()."

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage:  sage_getargspec(LatticePoset().is_subdirectly_reducible).args
['self', 'certificate']
```

Replying to [comment:2 chapoton]:

Thanks, that was fast. So the code can be something like


```
from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
props = ['is_distributive', 'is_self_dual', 'is_modular']
L = posets.RandomLattice(10, 0.99)
for p in props:
    f = attrcall(p)
    if 'certificate' in sage_getargspec(getattr(L, p)).args:
        if attrcall(p)(L) != attrcall(p, certificate=True)(L)[0]:
            print("Oh no!")
```

As an example of bugs to be found with this: #26857.

Nice way to handle `is_doubling_constructible` and other currently handled by `test_attrcall` is needed.

Untested code for lattices.

More to be done for general posets.

This should now be ready to review, as all dependencies have been solved.

I think pyflakes spotted an error:

```
+src/sage/tests/finite_poset.py:16: dictionary key 'doubling_interval' repeated with different values
+src/sage/tests/finite_poset.py:17: dictionary key 'doubling_interval' repeated with different values
```

That is both not in these changes and not a reason to block a positive review.
