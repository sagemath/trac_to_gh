How to do this automatically and be py3-compatible? With


```
'certificate' in inspect.getargspec(LatticePoset().is_subdirectly_reducible).args
```


I can see that there is a certificate-option, but "Python 3.5+ recommends inspect.signature()."

Thanks, that was fast. So the code can be something like


```
from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
props = ['is_distributive', 'is_self_dual', 'is_modular']
L = posets.RandomLattice(10, 0.99)
for p in props:
    f = attrcall(p)
    if 'certificate' in sage_getargspec(getattr(L, p)).args:
        if attrcall(p)(L) != attrcall(p, certificate=True)(L)[0]:
            print("Oh no!")
```
