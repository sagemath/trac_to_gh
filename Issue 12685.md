The file `sage/plot/plot.py` is getting huge.  One consequence is that doctesting this file (without `--long`) takes double the time of any other file.  One obvious thing to do is to move the `Graphics` class to a new file.

Shouldn't it be necessary to issue a deprecation warning for at least a few Sage releases before we change the location of something?  If I understand correctly, this patch will break all uses of `sage.plot.plot.Graphics`.  To me, this seems like a bad idea for 5.0.

For example, `graphs/graph_generators.py` and `shemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py`.

I'm switching this to "needs info", and someone can overrule me if there is good reason to skip the deprecation process for this ticket.

Yes ! There is an option "--warn-links" to docbuild recently added by #9128.

I'm still a little nervous about such a big change (I know it's not really big in that sense, but it does make a large change to where things are located) in an rc.  I bet some outside links to the Sage doc will break, and the biggest problem is that all those helpful `show` options, which are only documented there, are now not in the same place as `plot`.    Although in principle redistributing like this is good and we should aim to fix timeouts, it does seem that this ticket was created in response to a somewhat contrived problem (timeout on busy systems).  Presumably someone can always make a system busy enough that Sage doctests will time out.  I'm just not sure that the last release candidate is the place for something that should be used "in practice" at least a little while.

I don't have time to come up with any other solutions, and if Ben checked things out and `DOCTEST_MODE` and `EMBEDDED_MODE` and so forth still work (and whatever other constants like DPI there are) without trouble in the same ways as before, then I guess that's okay.  But it does seems like (said the person who has never done a release, nor has the skills to do one) that we should have had a Sage 4.9 a few betas ago so this kind of thing wouldn't have happened...

It sounds to me as though we should give this a positive review so that it can go into a prerelease and get lots of testing, get lots of people looking at it. (I would suggest the same for #11616, to make it easy to test it on different platforms.)

I agree with `@`jhpalmieri. I've looked over the patch again and the reviewer patch. This gets a positive review from me. I'm running a patchbot to check the doctests again. It's pending.

It is not a "contrived problem".  It is a real issue happening in practice.

If somebody comes up with a different solution to these timeouts, that's fine for me.  I just think that the timeouts should be fixed in sage-5.0 and splitting `plot.py` seemed a reasonable solution.
