Missing closing double-backtick, and maybe spell out "minus":

```
- at most 64-``number_of_vertices
+ at most 64 minus ``number_of_vertices``
```


Missing blank line between

```
    TESTS::
```

and the test block it introduces.

may be it's time to update the link to nauty to https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it

also, some pep8 comments

```diff
-        if number_of_sets+number_of_vertices > 64:
+        if number_of_sets + number_of_vertices > 64:
```



```diff
-        sp = subprocess.Popen(nautyprefix+"genbgL {0}".format(nauty_input), shell=True,
+        sp = subprocess.Popen(nautyprefix + "genbgL {0}".format(nauty_input), shell=True,
```

I checked that both uniroma and ANU urls are mentioned in SPKG-install.txt
And, by the way, please review the nauty update ticket #26891
