# Issue 10533: poor labelling of notebook button

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10586

Original creator: gbe

Original creation time: 2011-01-11 01:46:01

Currently, to add or remove collaborators from a worksheet, one presses a button labelled "Invite Collaborators."

Since the same button is pressed when adding ``or'' removing, it should be labelled something like "Update Collaborator List."

ancient ticket about deprecated sagenb, can we close ?

To my mind, deprecated does not mean not supported. Ticket proposing new features for the notebook could be closed. But until the sage notebook is not officially supported anymore, it makes sense to keep these issue open. I know it is pointless but more politically correct.

Can we automatically convert them all to github/sagenb issues?

43.19? Why is there a rush to close them now?

Yes. github has an API for that

https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#create-an-issue

Is it worth the trouble?

I don't know if it's worth the trouble, but the SageNB developers (if there are any left) should be making decisions about which issues to keep alive.

Whoops, I was perhaps politically incorrect last night when I closed a huge swath of notebook tickets assigned to me.  The last commit to github/sagenb was in december 2019, so it's apparently not quite dead.

More to the point, _no one_ should be closing tickets related to anything without at least two people involved, one way or another.  Even for things like this.

Also, most of them do have "upstream" issues that I created some time ago - though as John says, how many people have time to work on fixing them is unclear.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
