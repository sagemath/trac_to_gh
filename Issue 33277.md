# Issue 33277: RealIntervalFieldElement.min and max ignores NaN

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33514

Original creator: mgoerner

The min isn't well-defined in the following cases, but we get NaN. Similarly for max:


```
>>> a = RIF('NaN')
>>> b = RIF(1)
>>> a.min(b)
1
>>> b.min(a)
1
```

RTFM

in the doc:

```
   Note that calls involving NaNs try to return a number when
   possible. This is consistent with IEEE-754-2008 but may be
   surprising.

      sage: RIF('nan').min(2, 1)
      1
      sage: RIF(-1/3).min(RIF('nan'))
      -0.3333333333333334?
      sage: RIF('nan').min(RIF('nan'))
      [.. NaN ..]
```
