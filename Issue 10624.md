(these would be implicit doctests I suppose)

Related to this: the documentation of `get_nf` seems to be more detailed than that of `nf_get_pol`. In particular, the documentation of `nf_get_pol` doesn't say that only nfinit, bnfinit and bnrinit are allowed (which I think it should). A doctest showing the error message for an rnfinit object would be useful.

I think doctests showing that these functions work for bnfinit and rnfinit would be good too.

Hi Jeroen,

Did you ever test your new code for converting PARI relative number field elements to Sage relative number field elements?

I get this (on 4.6.2.alpha3 regardless of whether I apply your patch):

```
sage: p = pari("Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)"); p
0
```

Clearly "0" is incorrect. This seems to be a bug introduced by the PARI upgrade:

```
                    GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.4.3 (alpha)
(13:18) gp > Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)
%1 = 0
(13:19) gp > Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)==0
%2 = 1
```


```
                  GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.3.4 (released)
(13:16) gp > Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)
%1 = Mod(Mod(x, x^2 - y), y^3 + 17)
(13:20) gp > Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)==0
%2 = 0
```

I can't test your patch this way:

```
sage: y = PolynomialRing(QQ,'y').gen()
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(y^3+17)
sage: x = PolynomialRing(K,'x').gen()
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2-a)
sage: p = pari("Mod(Mod(x, x^2-y), y^3+17)")
sage: L(p)
0
sage: p.sage()
0
sage: p.sage().parent()
Integer Ring
```

It is possible that I am using PARI in the wrong way here. Regardless of that, your patch should contain an example of converting PARI relative number field elements to Sage relative number field elements.

Whether or not "0" is correct, I believe you are doing things the wrong way.  The following is a proper example of a PARI relative number field element::

```
Mod(Mod(y, y^3 + 17)*x + Mod(1, y^3 + 17), x^2 - y)
```


Here, K is the field over QQ defined by `y^3 + 17` and L is the extension defined by `x^2 - y`.

There is an example in my patch in `sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx`, line 3316.  But it might be a good idea to expand this.

Replying to [comment:7 jdemeyer]:
> The following is a proper example of a PARI relative number field element::
> {{{

> }}}

Of course, sorry about that.

I don't know how much work it is, but as you are adding extra examples anyway, perhaps you could fix this:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-5)
sage: p = pari("Mod(x,x^2+7)")
sage: K(p)
a
sage: K(p)^2
-5
sage: p^2
Mod(-7, x^2 + 7)
```

The same issue is there with your code:

```
sage: y = PolynomialRing(QQ,'y').gen()
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(y^3+17)
sage: x = PolynomialRing(K,'x').gen()
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2-a)
sage: q = pari("Mod(Mod(y, y^3 + 19)*x + Mod(1, y^3 + 23), x^2 - y + 1)")
sage: L(q)
a*b
```

I think K(p) and L(q) should raise errors.

> There is an example in my patch in `sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx`, line 3316.  But it might be a good idea to expand this.

Great! I'd say

* at least one example with the completely written out correct form of PARI, in case idiots like me swap the moduli around again.

* at least one example with the incorrect moduli that raises an error (like my examples in this comment).

* at least one example in the documentation of the `__init__` method of `NumberFieldElement` (because that is where your new code is).

Done for absolute elements.  For relative elements, the checking is impossible because it should be done by PARI's `rnfeltreltoabs()`, but it's not.

I decided not to do this, because it would lead to duplication and also because there isn't a single example of relative number fields in `NumberFieldElement.__init__()`.

I've added the new patch, but I still need to doctest it (also together with #2329).
