Fix the Python 3 doctest failures in `combinat/root_systems/weyl_characters.py`. The failures all come down to sorting. The more complicated problem is the method `fusion_labels` which relies on sorted output when it shouldn't.

It would be clearer if the second test here makes use of the sorted basis instead of sorting the highest weights, assuming assigning labels in the third test takes those weights into account.

```
        sage: sorted(B22.basis(), key=str)
        [B22(0,0), B22(0,1), B22(0,2), B22(1,0), B22(1,1), B22(2,0)]
        sage: sorted([x.highest_weight() for x in B22.basis()], key=str)
        [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1/2, 1/2), (2, 0), (3/2, 1/2)]
        sage: B22.fusion_labels(['1','X','Y1','Y2','Xp','Z'])
```


Also, I am wondering whether the more fundamental problem is that `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` used for the basis does not give consistent results.

```
sage: S = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([1000], lambda a: [a//2, a//3]); S
A recursively enumerated set (breadth first search)
sage: str(list(S))  # py3
'[1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, 111, 37, 83, 125, 55, 41, 12, 18, 27, 62, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20, 31, 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 0, 5, 7]'
sage: str(list(S))  # py2
'[1000, 500, 333, 250, 166, 111, 37, 83, 125, 55, 41, 18, 27, 12, 62, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20, 31, 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 0, 5, 7]'
```

If the successor function gives consistent results, the breadth-first search should be unique, should it not?

I can only reproduce this if I check out the branch and fail to run `make` or `./sage -b` before running tests. Can you double check that you really get this failure?

Should we delay the changes here until #27967 is resolved, or do these and then perhaps have to change then again depending on #27967 and/or other changes to `RecursiveEnumeratedSet`?
