With Sage 9.5.rc3:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(71^2), [5,5])
sage: phi = E.isogeny(E.lift_x(0))
sage: E1 = E.change_weierstrass_model(9,8,7,6)
sage: phi = phi * E1.isomorphism_to(E)
sage: P = E1.lift_x(1)
sage: P in phi.domain()
True
sage: phi(P)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ...

~/prg/sage/src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py in _call_(self, P)
   1182             outP = (tempX, tempY)
   1183
-> 1184         return self.__E2(outP)
   1185
   1186     def __getitem__(self, i):

# ...

TypeError: Coordinates [46, 3*z2 + 44, 1] do not define a point on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 5*x + 5 over Finite Field in z2 of size 71^2
```


The reason is the following code in `EllipticCurveIsogeny.__compute_via_velu()`:

```
        a1 = self.__E1.a1()
        a3 = self.__E1.a3()
```

Here, `.__E1` is the same as `.domain()`, but the Vélu formulas compute the "inner" isogeny. Thus, these should be the `a1,a3` constants of the pre-isomorphism codomain.

That's great, just what I was suggesting.
