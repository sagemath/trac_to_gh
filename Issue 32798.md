The error is because the preceding call to `rsa()` generates a key with `p=q` when using this seed.

Instead of


```
....:     p = next_prime(ZZ.random_element(2**(bits//2 +1)),
....:                    proof=proof)
....:     q = next_prime(ZZ.random_element(2**(bits//2 +1)),
....:                    proof=proof)
```


we should be able to do


```
....:     p = q = ZZ.zero()
....:     while (p == q):
....:         p = next_prime(ZZ.random_element(2**(bits//2 +1)),
....:                        proof=proof)
....:         q = next_prime(ZZ.random_element(2**(bits//2 +1)),
....:                        proof=proof)
```


(we really only need to regenerate `q`, but this is nice and symmetric.)

But for these tests to serve their intended purpose we'll need William (hint hint) to pick a solution so that it can be incorporated into the book (https://github.com/williamstein/ent) as well.
