Add the function to TOC.

Also, how is this defined for the empty lattice?

Maybe SEEALSO-links can be added later. At least being distributive is stronger property that this.

TOC and SEEALSO done. But I have no idea what should be the answer for the empty lattice.

I have decided to use the same ticket for adding also another method. I promise I will stop here.

I mark this as positive review.

The reference should go to the master bib file, but that can be corrected later.

(Canceling, as the were another commit in writing this...)

Seems to be OK. An example where an element is left modular but not modular would be nice, but that can be added later.
