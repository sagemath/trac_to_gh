# Issue 33882: src/bin/sage-env: Export CXXCPP

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34119

`src/bin/sage-env` exports `CXX` (from the `configure` values - #32436).

We export `CXXCPP` as well to avoid an issue with the meson build system - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16536#issuecomment-1175419747, which will make the workaround added in #34081, removing `-std` flags from `CXX`, unnecessary.

I thought this would make the workaround added in #34081, removing `-std` flags from `CXX`, unnecessary. But configure sets `CXXCPP="g++ -std=gnu++11 -E"`, so `meson` would still have the same problem
