Keywords: clang, libc++

Presently linbox assumes that clang and libc++ only come on OSX,
and breakes such a configuration by forcing low-level libstdc++-only features (see #12426, comment 109)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21977

I corrected the bit about `std::_Bit_reference` at the top of `field/gf2.h` and there is another similar problem at the end of the same file

```
[linbox-1.4.2] ../../linbox/field/gf2.h:1010:10: fatal error: 'bits/stl_bvector.h' file not found
[linbox-1.4.2] #include <bits/stl_bvector.h>
[linbox-1.4.2]          ^
[linbox-1.4.2] 1 error generated.
```

The code is 

```
#if __cplusplus >= 201103L
#if defined( __APPLE__) && defined(__clang__)
#include <__bit_reference>
#else
#include <bits/stl_bvector.h>
#endif /* __clang__ */
```

You shouldn't use headers under `bits` directly, they are implementation dependent. Is it hard to understand?
