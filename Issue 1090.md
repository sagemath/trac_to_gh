MoinMoin 1.6 is still beta as of this posting, but it has an awesome feature where you can control access to pages hierarchically. So if you have your wiki going, and you want everything under wiki.blah.org/Private to only appear to a few specific users, then you only need to modify the page Private. Right now, you'd have to do every single page individually.

I'm wondering how long MoinMoin typically takes to go from beta to release.
