SageMath ships a patched Python which adds a warning if `.` is on the path and deemed insecure, see https://bugs.python.org/issue16202 and #13579.

This patch is not going to be part of Python anytime soon and afaik no distribution other than Sage-the-distribution is shipping this patch.

For packagers it is annoying to work around the doctests that expect this Python patch to be applied. Also it means that for Sage development we cannot swap out SageMath's Python with one coming from our (Linux) distribution. But long-term we want to be able to replace more SPKGs with distribution packages. (I know that embray is working on that.)

I would like to discuss this issue here. From my point of view, we should not expect this patch to be applied in doctesting and in Sage in general. (Actually, I don't think we should apply this patch at all and just behave like vanilla Python does but that's probably too controversial.)

I would like to hear some arguments here and come up with something that is going to make packagers happy because I believe that's really what we should be striving for. We might want a vote on sage-devel in the end but that remains to be seen.

I hope I am not creating a duplicate with this ticket (I might have tried to do something like that before...)

See #25358 for a related ticket.

Your description sounds like a duplicate of #25358, but if I read the title correctly you want to go further and also remove all other patches? I agree with that in principle, but it will be hard.

We currently apply two patches to python that I added just for sage. One is a bug that has since been fixed upstream and will not be necessary once there is a new release: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/6118

The other fixes [This is the Trac macro ** that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (https://bugs.python.org/issue27177)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-macro), which was fixed but never backported. I have not found any way to work around this patch since we need `re` to work with sage integers but `re` is not (at least not easily) monkey-patchable.

Yes, I should have been more clear about that. I want to do something about the patches that won't make it into upstream Python 2 because these will also never make it into the majority of distributions. I wasn't aware of the "re" one.

So, something like `# optional: sage-the-distribution`. That would work for packagers I guess.

I wonder whether that Python patch could not be monkey-patched in Sage somehow and then everybody would be happy? (We can of course add it for the doctesting as was done in #25358 but that does not solve the general problem of running Sage in an insecure location.)

I'd be fine with dropping or keeping the patch, as long as the doctests don't depend on it.

The `re` one is hard. I think it is technically possible to monkey patch re, but it does require selling the soul of your firstborn since it is a builtin: https://gist.github.com/mahmoudimus/295200

Other than that we could try to push upstream for a backport once again. Their reasoning is that the fix actually adds a feature instead of fixing a bug and only bugfixes are backported.

We would have to be very careful with that, too many differences could make sage-on-distro a second class citizen. Also it would probably be tempting to take the easy way out and "fix" problems by disabling tests on distro instead of fixing the underlying issue. On very limited cases like this it would probably be fine.

I think it's not really important in a math context. I think we could change the few doctests where we actually access a match with a Sage Integer to use named groups instead; and explain why that might be a better idea in the doctest.

I don't think that I've ever used `re` in Sage. I think it's not really important in a math context. I think we could change the few doctests where we actually access a match with a Sage Integer to use named groups instead; and explain why that might be a better idea in the doctest. However, I have not had a look at these tests yet.

Okay

> I think it's not really important in a math context. 

First, I hope you're not just generalizing from your own experience: that is a dangerous thing to do. Second, it is used in the Sage library, for example for argument parsing or LaTeX stuff. And therefore, third, Sage is not just a math context; people use it for other things, such as developing Sage.

I'm an experienced Sage user, but using `m.group(int(0))` was not obvious. If we just remove support for Sage integers in the `group` method, we will end up with some confused users.

So a strong -1 for removing this patch.

I want to remove reliance on this patch from the Sage library so things work without it and change the doctests that rely on it/change them to #optional: python3.

That is going in the direction of "distribution of second class citizen", with a feature (not a small one in my opinion) only working/tested on sage-the-distribution. I don't think removing a test for a valid use case is a good idea. At least I see value in that test for the nix package.

In this case, I don't actually see this problem. We would be testing this for Python 3 at least which is where we are going to anyway. (We could of course add an additional test for `optional: sage-the-distribution`.)

I might be wrong but I can't see that we could get the re patch into Debian or Conda (and I wouldn't even propose to try.)

I think python3 is still going to take some time.

Well, I am using python 3.7 and 3.8 from the dsitro in sage-on-gentoo, without needing additional patches. Prior to the move to python3 I needed to provide a patched python 2.7 for sage-on-gentoo.

Not anymore.
