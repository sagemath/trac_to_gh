CC:  kcrisman jdemeyer yomcat

Singular fails with the most recent version of Xcode (downloaded 12 March 2014), with the error

```
ld: symbol dyld_stub_binding_helper not found, normally in crt1.o/dylib1.o/bundle1.o for architecture x86_64
fatal error: libtool: internal link edit command failed
```

One fix is to remove the line

```
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
```

from `spkg-install`, and use the value of `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from `sage-env`. This needs testing on a variety of OS X machines.

By the way, do I need to bump the package version number if I'm only changing `spkg-install`?

you need to bump the version to force a recompilation. No need to bump it if it fixes a problem building on a particular architecture as you wouldn't have been able to build that version on that computer previously.

Why do we set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` at all, isn't that only required for building portable binaries (i.e. if SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`)? 

We don't have a 10.4 buildbot at this point (Jeroen's box doesn't have git).

Good question, and I don't know the answer. I seem to recall problems building Python without doing this. I don't know about Singular; I'm not even sure when this part of `spkg-install` first appeared.

By the way, the cliquer `spkg-install` file has a similar line (with 10.3 instead of 10.4), but until that starts causing problems, we should probably leave it alone.

The tarball includes git but the buildbot uses git directly to get the sources and changesets. So it is a requirement for running the buildbot slave.
