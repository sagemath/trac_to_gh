This is a follow-up ticket to #5428.

See the discussion there, I'll attach a preliminary patch (untested) for the "root cause". However, this change will break many doctests (see #5428). These are easy to fix, but make necessary a much larger patch (touching more than a dozen files) than the preliminary one.
