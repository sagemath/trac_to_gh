Keywords: LazyPowerSeries aorder approximate order

Hi,

I found a bug in the LazyPowerSeries class of package combinat.
There is mistake in the computing of the approximate order of a serie.
A demonstration of the bug :

```
sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: B = R([0,0,0,1,0])
sage: B.aorder
0
sage: B.coefficients(10)
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
sage: B.aorder
1
```


Here, a patch :

Bienvenue Ã  bord !

Your patch does not looks good: it contains three times the same thing. It is necessary to make it again in a more clean way.

It is not clear to me what the expected result should be in the example given above. Which answer is correct and which one is not ?

Apart from that, it would be good to add a test to check that the error is corrected. Something like

```
One checks that :trac:`14685` is solved::

    sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
```

and then the appropriate example.

Hello,

the corrected behaviour should be added **to the code**, in the documentation at the start of the function.

Your patch still looks strange. How do you make it ?

You should

```
1) cd to the directory sage-5.9/devel/sage-main/
2) create a patch with hg qnew trac_xxxxx_name_of_the_patch.patch
3) edit the sources
4) put the changes into the patch by hg qrefresh (then either go to step 3 or step 5)
5) edit the header of the patch by hg qrefresh -e
6) export the patch by hg export tip > filename (for example $HOME/trac_xxxxx_name_of_the_patch.patch)
7) put this exported file in trac
```

Hi!

Thanks for working on the lazy power series code; it needs some love.

Just one thing to be careful with; I haven't looked in detail in your code, so maybe it takes care of this already:

The method might be passed as argument a lazy power series implemented by a function f(n) which returns always 0; or some non zero coefficient but only for n very large. In such a case we don't want to run forever: this is about computing an approximation of the order, and often, knowing that the order is at least 1 or at least 2 is sufficient for the purpose (initializing the recurrence for computing series defined recursively). 

Of course, there are case where we do want the exact order, even at the price of running for a long time.

Its possible that the interface needs a bit of cleaning up so that the distinction between approximate order and order would be well exposed (and by the way maybe this should really be called valuation rather than order).

for chapoton :

I made the patch with a **diff -Naur ** but I will fix this.
Thank you for the detailed method.

for nthiery :

I am not sure to understand what you said :
currently the computing of the approximate order cost is amortized on every request for a serie's term (and it's a little cost). Normally, the order should be known when the approximate order reaches him.

The patch keeps this behavior.
This was your question ?

Moreover, the current version do not compute the right order too :
 {{{
 sage: R = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
 sage: B = R([0,0,0,1,0])
 sage: B.order
 Unknown series order
 sage: B.coefficients(10)
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 sage: B.aorder
 0   #instead of 3
 }}}

This is also set to be replaced soon; see #31651.
