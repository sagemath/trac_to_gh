We are now at Sage 9.0.beta6, so it may be time to prepare the update of documentation examples in order to have them in 9.0...

Eric, I was hoping to get #28672 included in this update, but since that is taking some time here you go. Perhaps we can get another update in before the final release.

Thank you! (sorry for pushing you but since having `threejs` as the default viewer will be one of the major changes for the end user in Sage 9.0, I thought it was important to have an up-to-date documentation). I will have a look at the updated examples tomorrow.

Indeed.
