I can't test this again now (lest my computer become unusable for another full day while binary-pkg does its magic) but the change looks good.  If Volker agrees you should set it to positive review.  I don't think anyone who is building bdists of Sage on an older Mac will be expecting the same level of prettiness as on an up-to-date one :)
