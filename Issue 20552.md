>  I think you can just remove $(TARGET)/.DS_store from the non_app_files: target in src/mac-app/Makefile and then build it on 10.7 -without the nice arrangement of the icons and background image :(

> I am not sure how you can tell binary_pkg to pick up that change. I would commit that change to a local repository and point binary_pkg's sage_yaml to that local repository.

And I can't quite figure out the right syntax on that, it seems to not be picking up the right branch.

The createDSStore I wrote is pure python and should be self-contained without any other dependencies than the system's python.
What does "python --version" report on your 10.7 system, Karl?

Its pretty clear that there is a an incompatibility with old OSX that breaks the struct parsing. Can't we just skip the createDSStore script if the version is <= 10.7?

From comment 3, I gather we close this ticket with my change which makes building under 10.7 with binary_pkg possible again - even though the icons won't be arranged and have a background image for .app.dmg built under 10.7.

I can't test this again now (lest my computer become unusable for another full day while binary-pkg does its magic) but the change looks good.  If Volker agrees you should set it to positive review.  I don't think anyone who is building bdists of Sage on an older Mac will be expecting the same level of prettiness as on an up-to-date one :)

Apparently this no longer applies given our updates of late.  I still have no problem with a version of this that applies.  Unfortunately I can't test it any longer, not having access to an older Mac any more.
