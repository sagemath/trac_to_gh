With the optional package `cbc` installed (and no other optional package):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/designs/orthogonal_arrays_build_recursive.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/digraph.py  # Bad exit: 127

sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/vertex_separation.pyx  # Timed out

The problems seem related to memory running out (#23748).
