Creating a Weyl group with the option `implementation="permutation"` is much faster, but unfortunately the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials are not computed correctly. Debugging this led to the discovery that the side of a descent is implemented inconsistently in the `bruhat_lower_covers` Element method of Coxeter groups. The culprit is the `has_descent` method that has different default sides that occurs in the code for this method.


```
sage: W = WeylGroup("A2",prefix="s")
sage: [s1,s2]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: (s1*s2).has_descent(1)
False
sage: 
sage: W = WeylGroup("A2",prefix="s",implementation="permutation")
sage: [s1,s2]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: (s1*s2).has_descent(1)
True
```


The patch fixes Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials by mandating `side="right"` where needed but doesn't address the underlying inconsistency.

So there is already a patch to fix this problem. It would be good if it can get merged.

I would not mind merging this portion first. Although we probably should do the same fix for the upper Bruhat covers.
