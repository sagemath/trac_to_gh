If no variable name is provided, Sage tries to compute
a pseudo-Conway polynomial to use as the modulus.

The [finite field constructor documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/finite_rings/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_constructor.html) warns:

> Note that the computation of pseudo-Conway polynomials
> is expensive when the degree is large and highly composite.
> If a variable name is specified then a random polynomial
> is used instead, which will be much faster to find.

To use a random irreducible polynomial as the modulus,
specify a variable name.


```
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: timeit("F = GF(p^6, 'a')")
5 loops, best of 3: 35.6 ms per loop
```

I think this is from #17569 (Allow creating
finite fields without a variable name).

I would tend to agree that a faster default
would better serve the casual user.

Let advanced users add keyword arguments
for specific time-consuming behaviours.

I think a change for very large primes is wise, but I think it's convenient that the following works, which would fail if we made the change suggested here:


```
sage: k = GF(4)
sage: l = GF(8)
sage: x = k.gen() + l.gen(); x
z6^5 + z6^4 + z6^3 + z6 + 1
sage: x.parent()
Finite Field in z6 of size 2^6
```


Here are some alternative suggestions to just always using random polynomials

* Use a cutoff depending on p: current behavior below the cutoff and random polynomial above the cutoff
* Print a warning (with an explanation of how to get different behavior) whenever an expensive computation is going to start

The main blocking step turns out to be factoring `p^n - 1`.
Luckily #31686 helps a lot:


```python
sage: p = 135066410865995223349603927
sage: %time F = GF(p^6, 'a')
CPU times: user 93.6 ms, sys: 1.8 ms, total: 95.4 ms
Wall time: 174 ms
sage: %time F = GF(p^6)
CPU times: user 1.48 s, sys: 7.48 ms, total: 1.49 s
Wall time: 1.91 s
```
