I have commented at the upstream Issue, but I would not call this a bug.  The build system  causes all the code to be compiled with a certain macro defined (namely NTL_ALL), and the code will not build without that flag being defined, but the build system does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined anyway!

It's at least a *documentation* bug (it's not true that `NTL_ALL` is the default).

> The build system...


Which "build system" are you talking about and why do you claim that "the build system does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined"

I meant the auto tools stuff.



does not allow any way for that macro not to be defined"

There is no option to Configure which affects it.

First of all, tt's clear that all `eclib` interface code should be in one place, not split in `sage.libs.mwrank` and `sage.libs.cremona`.

Do you prefer to change both to `sage.libs.eclib`?
