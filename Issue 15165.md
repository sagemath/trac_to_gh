Just to check if I understand correctly, is the situation as follows?
1. PARI's `eint1()` had potentially large errors both for a single argument and for the vector version;
2. the single argument version is fixed upstream;
3. for the vector version `y = eint1(x, n)` with `n > 15`, the entries `y[i]` with `i >= 15` can still have large errors;
4. the patch fixes (1) by backporting the upstream fix (2), and fixes (3) by increasing the precision depending on *n*.
A small observation about where to look for the cause of (3): it could be related to the fact that `mpveceint1()` (in `basemath/trans3.c`) apparently computes the `y[i]` with `i >= 15` via a recursive formula going from `i = n` downwards.  I guess any detailed discussion of this should continue on the `pari-dev` mailing list.

You're mostly right, except that the vector version is also much better in the PARI git version. That algorithm was completely rewritten and I also backported that.

I found the extra number of bits needed experimentally.

I see, this new implementation was not in Karim Belabas's recent patch, but was written by Henri Cohen and was already in PARI 2.6.1, before #15299 existed.

Looks good, works as documented, and the new doctests appear to be very thorough and as good as you can possibly get, apart from proving the error bound from the PARI source code.

Just a trivial reviewer patch to fix the reference to Cohen (even though you didn't touch this): the page number of Prop. 5.6.12 in my edition is different, so I just removed the page number.

Exactly. The errors bounds that I get are a combination of reading the PARI source code and experiments, they are not proven.
