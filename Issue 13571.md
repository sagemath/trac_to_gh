Having loops is always a bad idea. Loops should be forbidden. Multiedges too. Labels too.

By the way, it was my mistake I know I wrote these lines `:-/`

There's a print left in that I think must have been for debugging.

It looks good to me and all doctests pass (except one that fails with the patch).  Should it have a doctest though?  I have included a patch adding one.  Other than that I give it a positive review.
