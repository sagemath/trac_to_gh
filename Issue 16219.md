Keywords: elliptic curve base change

The function descend_to which was implemented in #9384 is incorrect.  The twisting parameter d in L* is only defined modulo (L*)^2 and one has to determine whether there is a representative which lies in K*, which the implementation does not do, so some "positive" results are missed.  I will post an example of this.  The heart of the problem being solved here is to determine whether (given that j(E) is in K of course) the twisting parameter in L*/(L*)^2 is in the image of K*/(K*)^2 or not, and the implementation ignores this.  (For j=0 or 1728 the principle is the same with squares replced by 6th or 4th powers respectively.)

I can see how to fix this for number fields (one can restrict from K*/(K*)^2 to a finite K(S,2) for an easily determined set S of primes) or for finite fields, but it may not be possible to have this implemented for arbitrary fields, which will cause a problem with the patching.

I remember looking at the Selmer group code some time ago (and again just now) and getting the impression that the group *K*(*S*, *m*) returned by `selmer_group(S, m)` is the one fitting in a natural exact sequence (warning: unicode experiment ahead)

1 ⟶ O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub><sup>×</sup>/O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub><sup>×*m*</sup> ⟶ *K*(*S*, *m*) ⟶ Cl<sub>*K,S*</sub>[*m*] ⟶ 0.

(I.e., I think *K*(*S*, *m*) should be canonically isomorphic to the flat cohomology group H<sup>1</sup>(O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub>, ***μ**<sub>m</sub>*).  This can be replaced by étale cohomology if *S* contains all places dividing *m*, and in that case I also think that the above H<sup>1</sup>, and *K*(*S*, *m*), should be isomorphic to H<sup>1</sup>(Gal(*K<sup>S</sup>*/*K*), ***μ**<sub>m</sub>*) with *K<sup>S</sup>* the maximal extension of *K* that is unramified outside *S*.)

Is the above exact sequence correct, and should it perhaps be mentioned in the documentation?  And is there a comparable exact sequence for the "true" Selmer group consisting of the elements giving unramified extensions of *K*?

That second answer was actually the wrong "correction" I pushed and then retracted.  It should be `[1, 4, -1, -4]` (as in comment:17); in fact 16 is a fourth power, hence represents the trivial element of the Selmer group.  The Selmer group is isomorphic to *C*<sub>2</sub> x *C*<sub>2</sub> (since both the units modulo 4-th powers and the 4-torsion in the class group are cyclic of order 2.)

I think the problem is the line

```
f = lambda o: m if o is Infinity else o.gcd(m)
```

where you will somehow need to take the orders of elements of the class group into account.

...done.  I added an optional parameter "orders" to the selmer_group method, default False gives the old behavious, if True also outputs a list of the orders of the generators, which are all equal to m when m is prime, but not necesarily otherwise.  Added doctests for this.  Now the iterator uses this instead of the old formula, which was wrong.

Note that this change will be superceded after #16496 when there is a proper class for these Selmer groups.  And also that the correctness of the current selmer_group function relies on the direct product fact alluded to in earlier comments!
