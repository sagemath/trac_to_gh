Keywords: elliptic curve base change

The function descend_to which was implemented in #9384 is incorrect.  The twisting parameter d in L* is only defined modulo (L*)^2 and one has to determine whether there is a representative which lies in K*, which the implementation does not do, so some "positive" results are missed.  I will post an example of this.  The heart of the problem being solved here is to determine whether (given that j(E) is in K of course) the twisting parameter in L*/(L*)^2 is in the image of K*/(K*)^2 or not, and the implementation ignores this.  (For j=0 or 1728 the principle is the same with squares replced by 6th or 4th powers respectively.)

I can see how to fix this for number fields (one can restrict from K*/(K*)^2 to a finite K(S,2) for an easily determined set S of primes) or for finite fields, but it may not be possible to have this implemented for arbitrary fields, which will cause a problem with the patching.

I remember looking at the Selmer group code some time ago (and again just now) and getting the impression that the group *K*(*S*, *m*) returned by `selmer_group(S, m)` is the one fitting in a natural exact sequence (warning: unicode experiment ahead)

1 ⟶ O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub><sup>×</sup>/O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub><sup>×*m*</sup> ⟶ *K*(*S*, *m*) ⟶ Cl<sub>*K,S*</sub>[*m*] ⟶ 0.

(I.e., I think *K*(*S*, *m*) should be canonically isomorphic to the flat cohomology group H<sup>1</sup>(O<sub>*K*,*S*</sub>, ***μ**<sub>m</sub>*).  This can be replaced by étale cohomology if *S* contains all places dividing *m*, and in that case I also think that the above H<sup>1</sup>, and *K*(*S*, *m*), should be isomorphic to H<sup>1</sup>(Gal(*K<sup>S</sup>*/*K*), ***μ**<sub>m</sub>*) with *K<sup>S</sup>* the maximal extension of *K* that is unramified outside *S*.)

Is the above exact sequence correct, and should it perhaps be mentioned in the documentation?  And is there a comparable exact sequence for the "true" Selmer group consisting of the elements giving unramified extensions of *K*?

That second answer was actually the wrong "correction" I pushed and then retracted.  It should be `[1, 4, -1, -4]` (as in comment:17); in fact 16 is a fourth power, hence represents the trivial element of the Selmer group.  The Selmer group is isomorphic to *C*<sub>2</sub> x *C*<sub>2</sub> (since both the units modulo 4-th powers and the 4-torsion in the class group are cyclic of order 2.)

I think the problem is the line

```
f = lambda o: m if o is Infinity else o.gcd(m)
```

where you will somehow need to take the orders of elements of the class group into account.

...done.  I added an optional parameter "orders" to the selmer_group method, default False gives the old behavious, if True also outputs a list of the orders of the generators, which are all equal to m when m is prime, but not necesarily otherwise.  Added doctests for this.  Now the iterator uses this instead of the old formula, which was wrong.  I thought that this was simpler than trying to recover the orders from the list of generators, since it is information we have to hand when constructing the list of generators.

For consistency I did the same for the special versions over QQ, though the bug did not apply here.  At the same time I noticed that over QQ when -1 is a generator it was put last while over number fields the units are always first, so I changed that (and the associated doctests) too.

Note that this change will be superceded after #16496 when there is a proper class for these Selmer groups.  And also that the correctness of the current selmer_group function relies on the direct product fact alluded to in earlier comments!
