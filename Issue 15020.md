Looks good and all tests pass.

Some of these tests need `# long time` and the last two take too long and should be disabled, even for `# long time`:

Changing status from needs_work to needs_review.

I added long time markers and removed the last test (Mike, I tried lower degrees in 

```
G31 = SymQ3.AffineGrothendieckPolynomial([3,1], 8)
```

but then the answers are wrong.

I don't think that we need the last example because we have other tests which at least verify the code works.

Tests pass in 20.7 s and 75.3 s with --long.
