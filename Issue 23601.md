Keywords: curve, manifold

- In method `solve` of class `IntegratedCurve`, the step of integration needs to be evaluated numerically (using `numerical_approx`) before calling any algorithm, in order to allow it to be an expression such as `pi`.
- In method `solve`, when using Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm ('bsimp'), method `ode_solve` was called in a wrong way.
- 'Bulirsch' was misspelled in documentation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23838

I feel like the fact that the corresponding `solve` function does not numerically evaluate such expressions is a bug that deserves its own ticket and (independent) fix. Subsequently, I would remove those changes that work around it.

I cannot comment on the second point, so someone else will have to review that.

The changes look good to me and I agree with comment:3. 

Besides, in the documentation of `IntegratedCurve.solve`, shouldn't it be mentioned that the default method (corresponding to `method=None`) is `rk4_maxima`?
