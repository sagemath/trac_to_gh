Logging in Sage doesn't work at all:

```
sage: log_text()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-732188d3c286> in <module>()
----> 1 log_text()

/home/itaibn-nobackup/sage/devel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/log.pyc in __init__(self, dir, debug, viewer)
     93         self._dir = dir
     94         self._filename = os.path.join(dir, self._filename())
---> 95         self._output = __IPYTHON__.output_hist
     96         self._input  = __IPYTHON__.input_hist_raw
     97         self._text = ''

AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'output_hist'
```

This is because the module `misc.log` uses the variable `__IPYTHON__`, which meant something different in older versions of IPython.
