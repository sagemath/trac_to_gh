CC:  @videlec

There is currently no `all` option for the .nth_root() method of algebraic numbers:


```
sage: a = QQbar(-1)
sage: a.nth_root(3)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
sage: a.nth_root(3, all=True)
...
TypeError: nth_root() got an unexpected keyword argument 'all'
```


while such an option exists for other representations of complex numbers:


```
sage: a = CDF(-1)
sage: sage: a.nth_root(3)
0.5000000000000001 + 0.8660254037844386*I
sage: sage: a.nth_root(3, all=True)
[0.5000000000000001 + 0.8660254037844386*I,
 -1.0 + 3.4393603416671414e-16*I,
 0.49999999999999933 - 0.8660254037844389*I]
```


The aim of this ticket is to provide one.

I did not remove it, i moved it into a `WARNING` section, after the `INPUT` section since it only makes sense when the input has `all=`False``.
