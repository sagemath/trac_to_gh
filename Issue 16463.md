Very minor, but could you can it to use `format`:

```python
return "``_`}, {`".format(Category._latex_(self),
                                  latex(self._left_base_ring),
                                  latex(self._right_base_ring))
```

Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf. If you don't want to change this, then you can just set a positive review as well. Thanks.
