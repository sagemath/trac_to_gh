# Issue 15253: improve documentation of projective dynatomic polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15490

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2013-12-06 17:09:13

Assignee: w.wu

There are two current issues. There is a typo: `n` instead of `period`.

Also, it would be nice to verify that the roots are actually giving preperiodic points of the correct period as a doctest.

Line 553-556 are duplicated and should be removed.

Line 539, 557 need a space around the =.

Since there are two attachments you should add an 'apply' block to the description.

ok. I think I got it right the second time. These changes now look fine to me and pass on my system.
