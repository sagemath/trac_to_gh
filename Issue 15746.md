From the Python docs (http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html):

//Changed in version 2.6: The double-underscore attributes !__closure!__, !__code!__, !__defaults!__, and !__globals!__ were introduced as aliases for the corresponding func_* attributes for forwards compatibility with Python 3.//

!__dict!__, !__doc!__ and !__name!__ were already available earlier.

Looking at the code with `hasattr` it should probably be manually refactored, keeping in mind that the `__XX__` are always available as alias for the `func_XX`.

Would you agree?

Actually this looks like a bug fix -- the previous version wouldn't work on Python functions/methods defined in Cython code (well they really just duck-type Python functions), since Cython doesn't include the `func_*` aliases.

The doctests just need updating to reflect the bug fix.

Actually, nevermind. This is supposed to be stripped, but there are now two instances of this line information, and only one is getting stripped. I should have a patch soon to fix it.

It seems that the 'func_doc' was being used to separate cython functions from python functions.

My questions (as still being pretty new to Sage): 
* Is it OK to build and test as above?
* When is it necessary to do `make clean; make lib-clean; make` instead of `./sage -b`?

Replying to [comment:14 wluebbe]:
> I did a rebase on develop to test with a fresh 6.2.beta6.

In general, you should probably merge in the latest beta rather than rebase (this is a change from how sage use to do things to match standard git practices). That said, extra merges are unnecessary, so you should try to avoid making merges unless there is a merge conflict or an issue is only popping up on a more recent version of sage.

> My questions (as still being pretty new to Sage): 
> * Is it OK to build and test as above?

Yes, although part of a review is to look at the changes in the code and make sure you agree with them.

> * When is it necessary to do `make clean; make lib-clean; make` instead of `./sage -b`?

Use `make` if there have been upgraded packages in the distribution (so between most betas/releases), you can use `./sage -b` if the only changes between the last time you built have been to the sage library (useful if you are working on a feature branch that only touches the sage library).
