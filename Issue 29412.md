# Issue 29412: spkg-configure.m4 for zn_poly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29649

Original creator: @thierry-FreeBSD

Original creation time: 2020-05-04 20:52:01

CC:  mjo fbissey mkoeppe isuruf

Keywords: zn_poly; spkg-configure; system packages

This ticket adds an spkg-configure.m4 for zn_poly, in order to use it from a system package if possible (see #27330).

Nothing special with this one: Sage builds without any problem with this system package.

Also, there's an upgrade ticket for zn_poly at #28959 that needs attention
