Assignee: @aghitza

CC:  @nexttime

It was discovered in #11575 that PolyBoRi's build system  does not export all relevant environment variables to the build environment.

The PolyBoRi spkg already treats the following:
`CC CXX SAGESOFLAGS PYTHONHOME SAGE_LOCAL`

Yet, the following standard environment variables are not utilized in PolyBoRi's build process:
`CFLAGS CXXFLAGS CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS ABI CPP`

The following environment variables should be exported to PolyBoRi's build environment:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH LD_RUN_PATH DYLD_RUN_PATH`

There are two kind of environment variables. 
First, there are `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH` (used by gcc} and similar ones. Those just have to be imported to the build environment, for instance by the following patch to PolyBoRi's `SConstruct` file:

It turned out that the build (and partially "Configure", by not finding the GD and M4RI libraries) was broken for me just because **`LIBRARY_PATH`** was missing in the environment set up by (or for) `SConstruct`.

So using

```python
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ, options = opts, tools = tools,                                                             
                  toolpath = '.')
```

(in `SConstruct`) would work for me, as well as just adding `LIBRARY_PATH` to the "exported" environment variables.

Another option is to add all the directories from `LIBRARY_PATH` to `LIBPATH` (in `custom.py`):

```python
if os.environ.has_key("LIBRARY_PATH"): 
    LIBPATH += os.environ["LIBRARY_PATH"].split(os.pathsep)
```


(Cf. [comment:ticket:11575:131 this comment] at #11575.)




It's in general of course not bad to export (and/or make use of) other standard environment variables, like `CFLAGS` etc., too, as mentioned in the ticket's description.

Yeah, this will be default now in 0.8.1. We change here one crucial paradigm (better explicit than implict variable import). But since one cannot know all set ups, this is the best was to do.

Well, this ticket isn't really a duplicate of #12655, it's just (more or less incidentally) superseded by #12655, since upstream also fixed this in the later release.

So until we've upgraded PolyBoRi to 0.8.1 (for other reasons as well), this is still an open issue, although not with PolyBoRi 0.7.1, but 0.8.0, our current spkg.  **#11909** addresses this... :-)
