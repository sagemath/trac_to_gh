# Issue 29089: Improvements for projection into affine hull

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29326

Keywords: polyhedra, affine hull

This ticket renames `affine_hull` of `Polyhedron_base` to `in_affine_hull` and adds a deprecation warning.

Before, this function was hard to find, as an affine hull of a polyhedron usually defined to be the smallest affine subspace containing the polyhedron.

Also this ticket makes use of #28724 to simplify this construction: We determine a transformation matrix `A` and a vector `b` and basically return `A*P - b`, where `P` is the polyhedron.

* In `polyhedra_quickref.rst`:

```diff
-    :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.affine_hull_projection` | constructs an affinely equivalent full dimensional polyhedra
+    :meth:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.affine_hull_projection` | constructs an affinely equivalent full-dimensional polyhedron
```


* Make the second paragraph in the docstring look like a one paragraph.
* In the "OUTPUT" section:

```diff
-        A full-dimensional polyhedron or a linear transformation,
+        A full-dimensional polyhedron or an affine transformation,
        depending on the parameter ``as_affine_map``.
```

* Remove the following line from "TODO" section:

```diff
-            - allow to return ``as_affine_map=True`` for default setting
```

* The new name `affine_hull_projection` is definitively better than the old name, but I am not sure if this is the best name. How about `full_dimensional_copy`? I am also not sure about this suggestion. So maybe we need another opinion.

The name has been discussed in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/MEmAIPDPcHY
If you want to propose a different name, please do so there, so that everyone is involved.

I just wanted to hear some other opinions, and since many people already agreed for the name, I am also fine with it.
