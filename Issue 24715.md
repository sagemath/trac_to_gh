# Issue 24715: Speed up SR(Integer)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24952

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-03-12 09:56:18


```
sage: a = ZZ(23)
sage: %timeit SR(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.51 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 218 ns per loop
```

Profiling with callgrind shows Python code the main contributor (only 0.4% Pynac), with a big chunk from malloc/free.

 * simply moving up the check for `Integer` in `SR._element_constructor_()` reduces the time to 300ns 
 * with a mock `Integer._symbolic_()` member replacing `if (hasattr(x, '_symbolic_')):` with `try: x._symbolic_()` gains 100ns

So this ticket will implement a dedicated `Integer._symbolic_()` that calls helper functions in `symbolic/expression.pyx`.

Note the created ex is "numeric" with type MPZ, i.e. Pynac (always) checks if a Python object is an Integer (using `py_funcs.py_is_Integer(o)`) and converts it to internal GMP format (using `py_funcs.py_mpz_from_integer(o)`). This means symbolic operations are optimally fast. It also means the process can be further improved if Pynac provided an interface to create its MPZ numerics directly from a given `mpz_t`.

In pure Python, it is 2-3x faster to check `hasattr` when such an attribute is not there, but having the attribute is slower, but not by so much:

```sage
sage: def check(x):
....:     if hasattr(x,'parent'):
....:         return x.parent()
....:     return None
sage: def check2(x):
....:     try:
....:         return x.parent()
....:     except AttributeError:
....:         return None
sage: z = 5
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 205 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 126 ns per loop
sage: z = int(5)
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 381 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 889 ns per loop
```

Similar using Cython:

```sage
sage: %%cython
....: def check(x):
....:     if hasattr(x,'parent'):
....:         return x.parent()
....: def check2(x):
....:     try:
....:         return x.parent()
....:     except AttributeError:
....:         return None
....: 
sage: z = 5
sage: %timeit check(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 94 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 68.5 ns per loop
sage: z = int(5)
sage: %timeit check(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 185 ns per loop
sage: %timeit check2(z)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 395 ns per loop
```

So I am not convinced that removing the `hasattr` check is for the better. I guess the question is how often do you expect things to be passed to `SR` that do not have a `_symbolic_`? What about also doing `SR(Rational)`?

The usage of '_symbolic_' should increase so I'll change it back and add the rational case.

Thanks. I agree that more thing should implement a `_symbolic_`. I just worry it is too much a swing in the other direction in terms of speed to assume it is an attribute.

Yes, I believe it is. What ticket does this come up on and is it a problem?

Oh, I see, a patchbot failure.

For my own sage-on-gentoo needs I follow the branch were Volker merges stuff. And that one showed up. It took a bit of effort to track a reasonable culprit amongst the tickets merged.

I just replaced the `...Coercion...` with the `...Conversion...` part because the new output does not seem wrong for me.

Should be good.
