There was a discussion on sage-devel a while ago about including the Boost headers [1]. As noted there, the latest version of the optional spkg `polymake` doesn't compile with the current boost package. The current boost package is called `boost-cropped` because it contains only a subset of the boost headers, because of package size.

This new package is contains *all* headers, which is still only a subset of the upstream tarball. The total packaged size is ~ 5M, which feels reasonable to me.

I've checked that the current version `polybori-0.8.2` and the current upstream version `polymake-2.12-rc3` both compile under Sage with these headers. I'm also submitting an spkg for polymake in another ticket.

Yes, I'm pretty sure it has: I can reproduce this issue on my stock 5.5 installation with upgraded boost and recompiled polybori.

The reason is possibly that polybori probably relies on `Boost.Random` for its randomness. Since we're doing a rather large update 1.34 - > 1.52, it's quite possible that the implementation has changed sufficiently to obtain different random values even with the same seed.

I would be inclined to just update the doctests, since these are inherently random results. But I would prefer to first hear the opinion of someone who actually uses polybori.
