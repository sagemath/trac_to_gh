We need a new magic comment

# optional - latex

for doctests that require latex installed on the system.

In addition, the developer's manual needs to be updated to include an explanation of the ellipsis in doctests. For your information: The ellipsis is part of Python's doctest framework. In Python it's not enabled by default, but in Sage it is.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20176

Maybe also adding a link to the corresponding part of the Python manual.

The two issues should be split on two tickets.

Regarding `latex`, we could consider trying to detect whether the system has LaTeX installed and so whether to run those doctests automatically. I don't want to do this for every non-Sage piece of software mentioned in an optional flag, but maybe LaTeX deserves a special case? I'm not sure.
