In order to build sage, on Mint 17 (presumably not different than Ubuntu 14.04) I needed to install libc6-dev myself, since it is apparently not included with the distribution by default.  This package should probably be added to the list of required packages in the installation guide.  The error message one gets because of not having libc6-dev installed is not very helpful.
