All doctests pass with IPython 3.0.0rc1 but the IPython notebook now depends on the newer tornado

Ok. Reviewing mathjax first is the low hanging fruit. Are #17234 and this ticket mutually dependent or could #17234 go in without this one? 

6.6.beta2 has a lot of ticket that will require a revision of sage-on-gentoo patches, that will go first before I review stuff that is non-trivial.

#17234 also works with IPython 2.x, but this ticket depends on it.

This works now, IMHO it is at least as good as the old one ;-)

After clearing out `DOT_SAGE`, I get this if I try to start up the notebook:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ohanar/code/sage/src/bin/sage-notebook", line 192, in <module>
    launcher(unknown)
  File "/Users/ohanar/code/sage/src/bin/sage-notebook", line 79, in __init__

```


It looks like you are trying to symlink into a directory that hasn't yet been created. Probably just need to add a `mkdir -p` type thing in there.

Good point, fixed.


---

Comment by ohanar created at 2015-03-10 23:47:08

Is there any reason why you didn't set this back to needs review? Everything looks good to me.

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.
