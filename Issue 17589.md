Ok. Reviewing mathjax first is the low hanging fruit. Are #17234 and this ticket mutually dependent or could #17234 go in without this one? 

6.6.beta2 has a lot of ticket that will require a revision of sage-on-gentoo patches, that will go first before I review stuff that is non-trivial.

It looks like you are trying to symlink into a directory that hasn't yet been created. Probably just need to add a `mkdir -p` type thing in there.
