Keywords: threejs near far clip clipping distance size

Plots that are very small/large in world-space coordinates can run into clipping issues with the default near and far clipping distances set in the Three.js viewer.

For example, the large "cool self-intersecting surface (Eppener surface?)" near the bottom of the documentation for [Parametric Plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_plot3d.html) appears completely blank due to far clipping:

```python
sage: var('u,v')
sage: f_x = u - u^3/3 + u*v^2
sage: f_y = v - v^3/3 + v*u^2
sage: f_z = u^2 - v^2
sage: parametric_plot3d([f_x, f_y, f_z], (u,-25,25), (v,-25,25), plot_points=[50,50], frame=False, color="green")
Graphics3d Object
```


...and the following small plot appears empty due to near clipping:

```python
dodecahedron().scale(1/1000)
```


This ticket proposes to fix this problem by scaling both the near and far clipping distances based on the overall size of the plot in world-space coordinates.

Oops, looks like I neglected to fill out the CC field when creating this ticket. I had forgotten all about it. Going to add Paul just to make sure he's in the loop, too.

Thanks for taking a look at it!
