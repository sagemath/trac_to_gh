Keywords: Mathematica, Interfaces

The interface with Mathematica has been broken since Mathematica 9 came out. 
The problem is that the program `math` does not behave nicely with expect. 
This fix uses a wrapper, as suggested in [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/), to make `math` readline-aware.

It seems to me that until the interface is designed properly, it will always have these issues. What is probably the most sensible approach is to use the C interface to Mathematica's published API, called MathLink

http://www.wolfram.com/learningcenter/tutorialcollection/MathLinkDevelopmentInC/

like "jmath" uses

http://robotics.caltech.edu/~radford/jmath/

See the 

The total source code for that is under 1000 lines, and makes use of functions like MLInitialize, MLActivate etc. 

Sure it will take a bit more time to get it right, but it seems to me a better long-term approach.

I agree that this is not a good solution: at the time I needed something quick and this was the fastest way I could get it to work. In the long term using MathLink is a better idea but I am not sure there is interest enough in this feature to justify the effort.

no, that wrapper (original or updated) does not check whether `math` can be called.
And it uses obsolete `os.popen` stuff, too...

This is a quick fix. We should probably use the occasion to rewrite the wrapper without os.popen

I did a little research and it looks like this wrapper is duplicated effort and we should get rid of it. We should be able to call `math` via `rlfe`, which is part of the standard GNU readline implementation, simply as

```
rfle math
```

Alternatively there are plenty more, maybe too fancy for our purpose, wrappers like `rlwrap`.

I don't think`rlfe` is part of Sage currently, and it's not installed by default on Ubuntu or OS X.  While there are many tools available that do the work of the current wrapper, it does have the advantage of being a tiny script with no dependencies other than Python itself.

Ok, I guess sticking to the python script is the better option here. Should I write a more modern version or should we use the patch from comment 18? Either option works for me.
