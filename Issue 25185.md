This is about two times faster than current implementation (assuming #25420 done). I tested with both `posets.BooleanLattice(9)` and with list of all posets on 7 elements.

Could be made better still.

For sake of readability, I would do

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py b/src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py
index 35d2bfa..de7752b 100644
--- a/src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py
+++ b/src/sage/combinat/posets/posets.py
`@``@` -4299,8 +4299,8 `@``@` class FinitePoset(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
 
         parts = []
         for i,j in zip(cut_points,cut_points[1:]):
-            parts.append(self.subposet([self._vertex_to_element(e)
-                                        for e in range(i+1,j+1)]))
+            G = self._hasse_diagram.subgraph(range(i+1,j+1))
+            parts.append(Poset(G.relabel(self._vertex_to_element, inplace=False)))
         return parts
 
     def product(self, other):
```

Once changed (or decided to ignore), you can set a positive review on my behalf.

The code change you suggest is for `ordinal_summands`, which you already give positive review in #25420.

The change is an easy one, but are these changes to ticket already reviewed those that Volker does not like?

It would be better to do it here in case #25420 is already merged in to Volker's branch.

Sorry I didn't realize the readability thing on #25420.
