Changing keywords from "manifolds, tensors, differential geometry" to "manifold, tensor, differential geometry".

All the tickets, except for #18786, are now ready for review.


---

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2015-10-19 09:42:15

All the tickets are now based on the category ticket #18175, so that the manifold categories are 
- `Manifolds(K)` for topological manifolds over a topological field K
- `Manifolds(K).Differentiable()` for differentiable manifolds
- `Manifolds(K).Smooth()` for smooth manifolds

Something I would like to see once the basics are done is a catalog of examples and common interesting manifolds:

- _n_-sphere
- _n_-torus
- real/complex projective _n_-space
- surfaces
- (Affine) Grassmannians
- Classical Lie groups (more for my info, a description of charts is on page 5 of https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~agk22/mfds.pdf, but this probably isn't a good atlas for doing computations)

I understand that some of these could be considered more wishlist than others. Some other wishlist items:

- [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory) to compute homology of manifolds.
- Manifolds with boundary
- Cartesian products of manifolds (or more generally, fiber bundles)
- DeRham cohomology (see, e.g., lecture notes above)

Thanks for these suggestions. For sure, one should have a catalog of standard manifolds. For the time being, there are only examples available as worksheets at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html, for instance 

- the 2-sphere at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_sphere_S2.html
- the real projective plane at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_projective_plane_RP2.html
- the hyperbolic plane at  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v0.8/SM_hyperbolic_plane.ipynb

All the above seem indeed desirable extensions. Even if they are not implemented yet, we should have them in mind when setting the basics.

PS: could you point to some existing catalog in Sage, in order to have some example?

Would there be any interest in Kontsevich graphs, which are related to Poisson structures on manifolds from what I saw? In particular, in https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00681, there is reference to a C++ package https://github.com/rburing/kontsevich_graph_series-cpp (with the MIT license).

With collaborators (independent from the above) we have developed a Sage package for calculations with Kontsevich graphs, Poisson brackets and deformation quantizations; the preliminary version will be released later this year.  We certainly would like to interface our code with SageManifolds.

The main thing we would need is a SageManifolds implementation of the algebra of multivector fields (exterior algebra of the tangent bundle) and its Schouten bracket https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schouten%E2%80%93Nijenhuis_bracket.  Are there any plans in this direction?

Very good!

It would certainly be easy to implement multivector fields at the level of a sequence of modules over the ring of scalar fields, in the same footing as what has been done for differential forms, cf. http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/diff_form_module.html
Each module, V<sup>p</sup>(M) say, will be the set of multivector fields with a fixed degree p, i.e. the set of p-vectors. Implementing the Schouten bracket atop of this as an exterior operator  V<sup>p</sup>(M) x  V<sup>q</sup>(M) --> V<sup>p+q-1</sup>(M) should not be too difficult either. But in such a setting, we do not introduce explicitely the algebra of multivector fields, which is the direct sum of all the modules V<sup>p</sup>(M).  Would this be an issue for you?

Great!  This is indeed the sort of implementation I was imagining.  One would like the operations of wedge product V<sup>p</sup> x V<sup>q</sup> -> V<sup>p+q</sup> and Schouten bracket V<sup>p</sup> x V<sup>q</sup> -> V<sup>p+q-1</sup>.  One would also like to have interior contractions with forms Omega<sup>p</sup> x V<sup>q</sup> -> V<sup>q-p</sup> and V<sup>p</sup> x Omega<sup>q</sup> -> Omega<sup>q-p</sup>, defined when q >= p.

>But in such a setting, we do not introduce explicitely the algebra of multivector fields, which is the direct sum of all the modules V<sup>p</sup>(M).  Would this be an issue for you?

I don't foresee any issue.

This seems quite straightforward to implement. Only a matter of finding time to do it...

Very good!

The question is then: what is your time scale? i.e. when would you like these features to be available?

The pure algebraic part of this has been implemented, including the interior products,  see #23207.
There remains to implement the differential part, in particular the Schouten bracket. On the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schouten%E2%80%93Nijenhuis_bracket), there is some warning: "There are two different versions, both rather confusingly called by the same name." Do we agree that the thing to implement is the bracket given by the second formula in that page?

Great, thank you!

Yes, we agree.

Multivector fields and their Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket are now ready (at least for review...): #23429.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-06-14 14:54:19

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

This metaticket is becoming too large; I am moving the tickets not closed in Sage 9.2 to the new metaticket #30525.

Should this ticket be closed, as a meta-ticket where everything is apparently done?

Yes it should be closed. All work currently in progress is in the next metaticket: #30525.
