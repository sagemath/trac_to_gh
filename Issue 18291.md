Something I would like to see once the basics are done is a catalog of examples and common interesting manifolds:

- *n*-sphere
- *n*-torus
- real/complex projective *n*-space
- surfaces
- (Affine) Grassmannians
- Classical Lie groups (more for my info, a description of charts is on page 5 of https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~agk22/mfds.pdf, but this probably isn't a good atlas for doing computations)

I understand that some of these could be considered more wishlist than others. Some other wishlist items:

- [Morse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_theory) to compute homology of manifolds.
- Manifolds with boundary
- Cartesian products of manifolds (or more generally, fiber bundles)
- DeRham cohomology (see, e.g., lecture notes above)

Thanks for these suggestions. For sure, one should have a catalog of standard manifolds. For the time being, there are only examples available as worksheets at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html, for instance 

- the 2-sphere at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_sphere_S2.html
- the real projective plane at http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples/html/SM_projective_plane_RP2.html
- the hyperbolic plane at  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v0.8/SM_hyperbolic_plane.ipynb

All the above seem indeed desirable extensions. Even if they are not implemented yet, we should have them in mind when setting the basics.

It would certainly be easy to implement multivector fields at the level of a sequence of modules over the ring of scalar fields, in the same footing as what has been done for differential forms, cf. http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/diff_form_module.html
Each module, V<sup>p</sup>(M) say, will be the set of multivector fields with a fixed degree p, i.e. the set of p-vectors. Implementing the Schouten bracket atop of this as an exterior operator  V<sup>p</sup>(M) x  V<sup>q</sup>(M) --> V<sup>p+q-1</sup>(M) should not be too difficult either. But in such a setting, we do not introduce explicitely the algebra of multivector fields, which is the direct sum of all the modules V<sup>p</sup>(M).  Would this be an issue for you?

Very good!

The question is then: what is your time scale? i.e. when would you like these features to be available?

The pure algebraic part of this has been implemented, including the interior products,  see #23207.
There remains to implement the differential part, in particular the Schouten bracket. On the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schouten%E2%80%93Nijenhuis_bracket), there is some warning: "There are two different versions, both rather confusingly called by the same name." Do we agree that the thing to implement is the bracket given by the second formula in that page?
