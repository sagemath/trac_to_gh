# Issue 20580: LatticePoset: Orthocomplements, interface part

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: latticeposet

After #20769 gets accepted add interface function(s). Maybe `is_orthocomplemented()` and `is_uniquely_orthocomplemented()` as different functions?

Won't work until #20769 gets into beta. Might also need more thinking about docstring.

Frédéric, another quite trivial review? (Trivial, as the implementation part has already been done.)

```
lattice has an orthocompletion
```

should be orthocomplementation, no ?

Of course.

do not use it.next() which is not py3 compatible, but next(it) instead.
(found by the patchbot)

Added. Now compiling and testing.

Passed test.

maybe `\wedge` should be `\\wedge` ?

Whatever. IIRC `\wedge` and `\\wedge` are OK in any case, but if you start with `"""` instead of `r"""` then you must use `\\vee` and not `\vee`.

And I don't like remembering this kind of things.

by the way, have you ever thought about an inverse method for cartesian products of posets ?

Yes I had, just like we already have `ordinal_summands()`. But that should be done to all digraphs, I think. Sage hase factoring of undirected graphs already. For posets only we should have inverse of ordinal product.
