`src/bin/sage-env` contains versioning logic, which is meant to ensure that environment variables are reinitialized in the middle of an upgrade. This appears to be obsolete because `sage --upgrade` makes sure that `sage-env` is not run.

Outdated after #32745, which extends `SAGE_ENV_VERSION` for a new purpose
