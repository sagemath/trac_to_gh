The Weil pairing implementation in Sage is horribly inefficient when the group order n is a cryptographically large composite integer.

The implementation is based on Miller's algorithm, which in its original version is a polynomial time algorithm, capable of handling large composite values of n.  However, the Sage implementation attempts to determine the order of the input points P and Q.  The problem of determining the order of a point on an elliptic curve of large composite order is conjectured to be computationally infeasible (Boneh-Goh-Nissim TCC'05), and all known methods for solving this problem require factoring n.

Therefore, by adding the order computation, the Weil pairing calculation is transformed from a polynomial time algorithm to a superpolynomial time algorithm requiring the factorization of n.

I propose to delete the code block that contains the order computation, since the order computation is not useful when n is prime, and is inefficient when n is composite.  Note that we still check to ensure P and Q are n-torsion -- this patch simply deletes the code to compute their exact order.  The attached file implements this change.

That's a very sensible thing to do. That is, don't just delete bad code, but comment it out and provide an explanation why it shouldn't be used.

I updated the patch to comment out the code, and added the explanation as well.

Great!

By the way, I noticed in your sage-devel thread you mentioned you are learning how to use Mercurial - so am I, and here's something I've learned.
