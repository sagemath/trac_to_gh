It would seem the memory management on these objects is rather fundamentally broken.
Also with lines like `Y= M+M` or `Y=X+X` I am seeing similar leaking behaviour.

Tested this on Sage 8.7, macOS Mojave and Ubuntu 19.04, and the problem seems to be fixed.

If someone else could confirm this on another OS (the person on ask used debian buster) then we can probably close this as wontfix.

I'm still seeing suspicious behaviour on sage 8.8.beta3 / python3, on Fedora:

If I set a vmem limit of 10 gigabyte and execute

```
n = 1000
X = zero_vector(GF(2), n)
M = zero_matrix(GF(2), n, n)

for _ in range(10000000):
    Y = M + M
```

sage still crashes for me (whereas a small number of iterations does run without problem).
