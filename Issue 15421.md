There is a problem with the CPLEX backend for MixedIntegerLinearProgram. Namely the fact that one specifies a variable to be binary gets ignored. I couldn't find the bug in the code (it looks like it handles this well) hence I am posting it here.



```
sage: M = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='CPLEX')
sage: A = M.new_variable(binary=True, dim=2)
sage: M.add_constraint(A[0][1]+A[0][2] == 2)
sage: M.solve()
0.0
sage: M.get_values(A)
{0: {1: 2.0, 2: 0.0}}
```


Best,

Jernej

None. Except that upgrading CPLEX seems to solve it. But please tell me : if you version of Cplex is broken too, do the doctests in graph/ really pass ? `O_o`

Given the number of binary ILP in there...

I have quite a recent version (if not latest) of CPLEX. I'll check that out though.

The tests of course do not pass, for example...

Which version do you have ? Can you check if it is the same as the one reported on the sage-support thread ?

I am running 12.5.1.0 and he is talking about 12.6.. So I guess that will do it.

I guess I'm gonna install this one make a general sage -t and then we see how it goes !

Well... If you can find out where this comes from... Being unable to reproduce it makes it a bit hard for me. Which version of Sage do you use, btw ?

Can you build a LP which returns something wrong, and type `p.show()` ? Because if THIS tells you that the variable is binary, that's totally because CPLEX is saying that the variable is binary and returns nonsense afterwards `:-/`

David Coudert just told me that he had the same problem on one of his machines `T_T`
