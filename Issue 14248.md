Robert, I think there is a serious Cython bug: the `__new__` method of a class might actually use the wrong class: in `devel/sage/sage/libs/gap/element.pyx`, the code

```
def GapElement_Record r = GapElement_Record.__new__(GapElement_Record)
```

generates

```
__pyx_t_1 = __pyx_tp_new_4sage_4libs_3gap_7element_GapElement(((PyTypeObject *)((PyObject*)__pyx_ptype_4sage_4libs_3gap_7element_GapElement_Record)), ((PyObject *)__pyx_empty_tuple), NULL);
```

Note the call to the `tp_new` function of `GapElement` (a child class), not `GapElement_Record`.

Here is what I found about the docbuilder crash: it works with Cython 0.18, not with current master at `0ee15b1829125b6844ac13f437c2d9bd61a4ceca`.

In `lazy_import.pyx`, somehow `self._object` becomes `NULL` in the line

```
setattr(cls, alias, self._object)
```

which is compiled to

```
           __pyx_t_1 = __pyx_v_self->_object;                                      
           __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_1);
           __pyx_t_10 = PyObject_SetAttr(__pyx_v_cls, __pyx_v_alias, __pyx_t_1); if (unlikely(__pyx_t_10 == -1)) {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 169; __py
           __Pyx_DECREF(__pyx_t_1); __pyx_t_1 = 0;                                 
```

I don't see anything suspicious here.

I did, and it didn't help. I could try to bisect the Cython git repo for the bug.
