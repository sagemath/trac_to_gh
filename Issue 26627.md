Is the change "verbose" â†’ "proof" intentional?

The change in documentation was done to match the actual function.

Shouldn't the description be changed as well, then?

I am not sure why it was proof instead of verbose, I have updated it to "verbose" so that it matches the functions in S_unit_solver.py.

The change `verbose` -> `proof` was correct, but also the description of the `proof` parameter should be fixed.
