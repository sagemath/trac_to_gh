Keywords: combinatorial hopf algebras, sage-combinat, tableaux, FSym

The `star_involution`, `omega_involution` and `psi_involution` methods of `FQSym` restrict to the subalgebra `FSym` (the Poirier-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of tableaux). They also "restrict" to the quotient `FSym^*`. This is in the paper by Poirier and Reutenauer.
