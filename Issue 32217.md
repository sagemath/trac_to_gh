# Issue 32217: trivial __copy__ and __deepcopy__ methods for number types

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32454

(split out from #13811):

Most Sage objects are immutable. Nevertheless, `copy` and `deepcopy` make copies (through pickling/unpickling) for them because we have not provided the classes with `__copy__` methods (which should just return the object) and `__deepcopy__` methods (which in many cases should just return the object).

```
sage: copy(0) is 0
False
```


In this ticket, we take care of the basic number types in `sage.rings`.

Note that the example in the description `copy(0) is 0` does not illustrate much. `0 is 0` is also false. Perhaps `a=0; copy(a) is a` is better, or `(a:=0) is copy(a)` if you want to celebrate that we're now using >=3.8.

I, for one, welcome our walrus overlords, but the celebration would be premature -- we still do support Python 3.7
