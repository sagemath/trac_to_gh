Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Do the new references show up as links for you? After merging the branch and doing `sage -b; sage -docbuild reference/combinat html` they both appear as the unlinked string *face_lattice()* for me. But I usually don't build the docs anymore so I don't know if that's supposed to be sufficient.

I think the issue with comment:5 is that the cited instances of `face_lattice` don't currently appear in the reference manual, so there is nothing for them to link to. I don't know if this would be a good idea, and it probably belongs on another ticket if so, but we could add a bunch of files to the reference manual, in the style of the matrix base classes:

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.rst b/src/doc/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.rst
index a5d9663c5d..d84e72b481 100644
--- a/src/doc/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.rst
+++ b/src/doc/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.rst
`@``@` -76,6 +76,14 `@``@` Base classes for polyhedra
 .. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
 
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base0
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base1
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base2
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base3
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base4
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base5
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base6
+   sage/geometry/polyhedron/base7
    sage/geometry/polyhedron/base
    sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_QQ
    sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_ZZ
```

and also add a section on Combinatorial Polyhedra, to include various files from `geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron`. I don't know anything about this code or why it isn't currently included in the reference manual.

Changing priority from trivial to major.

Let's fix this here on the ticket, looks like we forgot to add them in #32651.

I propose these changes. It's interesting that #30448 didn't catch the markup error in `face_iterator.pyx`.

Now both `face_lattice` links work for me.

Now the documentation doesn't build:
