Keywords: notebook

As discussed in #25837, we should add a deprecation notice to sagenb. It has been de-facto replaced (at least the notebook itself, not all of its features) a while ago. However we never really communicated that to the user.

Before we move forward with deprecating the notebook, we should inform the active users of sagenb.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25852

Yes, and I believe at least 1/2 year is standard policy, though a year is probably better here.  Luckily through a sort of process of osmosis this has slowly been communicated for a while.

This would almost certainly need at least some minor changes to sagenb.  One could be fancy and have some javascript with a banner message that disappears and you can ask "don't show this again" but perhaps something more basic just hard-coded in to the main login and list of worksheets page would be easier and more obvious.

I would personally prefer a shorter period of one or two releases before the notebook is made optional (assuming the necessary changes can be made in that time). We could then still give that optional package live support for half a year or a year.

The German version is a more or less direct translation of my initial proposal. I prefer that one too, but compromised to Erik's version. I forgot to update the German translation.

`@`Erik what do you think?

For the non-german speakers: "Warning: The sage notebook is in the process of being deprecated. Click here to learn more."

Alternatively even shorter (but some people might not like the "soon"): "Warning: The sage notebook will be deprecated soon. Click here to learn more."
