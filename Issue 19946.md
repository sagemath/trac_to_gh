Overall I think it is good except for this change:

```diff
-            sage: GP.set_edges(edge_color='black')
-            sage: GP.plot()
+
+        .. PLOT::
+
+            d = DiGraph({}, loops=True, multiedges=True, sparse=True)
+            d.add_edges([(0,0,'a'),(0,0,'b'),(0,1,'c'),(0,1,'d'),(0,1,'e'),(0,1,'f'),(0,1,'f'),(2,1,'g'),(2,2,'h')])
+            GP = d.graphplot(vertex_size=100, edge_labels=True, color_by_label=True, edge_style='dashed')
+            GP.set_edges(edge_style='solid')
+            sphinx_plot(GP)
+
+        ::
+
+            GP.set_edges(edge_color='black')
             Graphics object consisting of 24 graphics primitives
```

I think you wanted:

```diff
+            sphinx_plot(GP)
+
+        ::
+
+            sage: GP.set_edges(edge_color='black')
+            sage: GP.plot()
             Graphics object consisting of 24 graphics primitives
```

Two stupid things:

- Could you make these sorts of changes, it makes it easier to read:
  {{{#!diff
+            g.add_edges([(0,0,'a'),(0,0,'b'),(0,1,'c'),(0,1,'d'),
-                (0,1,'e'),(0,1,'f'),(0,1,'f'),(2,1,'g'),(2,2,'h')])
+                         (0,1,'e'),(0,1,'f'),(0,1,'f'),(2,1,'g'),(2,2,'h')])
  }}}
- Could you split that really long line which constructs the digraph for the plot?

Once you've done that, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
