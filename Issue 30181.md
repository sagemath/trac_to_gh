CC:  @jhpalmieri

In `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`, there are supposed to be PDF icons next to each document, as links leading to the PDF builds. Those are missing, because the file `_static/pdf.png` is missing. For some reason, it is not copied from `src/doc/en/website/static` to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/_static`.

To see the problem, check that:

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild all html` does not install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

But running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild website html` does install the PDF icon to the right place.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30418

The code in lines 583--585 has nothing to do with the current issue. It should not be removed.

Your code in lines 1726--1728 is effectively the same with running `sage --docbuild website html`. This just covers the issue.

The issue of this ticket is to see why `sage --docbuild all html` does not install the pdf icon. The pdf icon is not installed because the website builder does not copy its static files folder. I checked this problem is also with the developer manual builder.

I think that code is intended to build the basic website framework for the PDF documentation. It appears to matter when `getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()` is executed, as far as installing the appropriate static files. Can you explain why?

> It should not be removed.


Of course I didn't remove it, I moved it.

> Your code in lines 1726--1728 is effectively the same with running `sage --docbuild website html`. This just covers the issue.


I know that. The question is why it works and why running `getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()` at a different stage does not.

> The issue of this ticket is to see why `sage --docbuild all html` does not install the pdf icon.


I disagree: you don't want the PDF icon if you haven't built the PDF documentation. So `sage --docbuild all html` should ideally not install the PDF icon.

The main purpose of the code is to provide the htmls for the basic website framework. The other code following it assumes that the htmls are in place. If you remove the code from the place where it is, the assumption is broken.

The question must be solved before we think of any cure.

The PDF icon problem is just a consequence of the bigger problem of `sage --docbuild all html` not copying the static files (of `website` and `developer` documentations.)
