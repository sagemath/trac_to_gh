I don't understand:


```
+                from sage.rings.qqbar import AA as base_ring
```


Why do we do a local import instead of resolving the global lazy import?

Otherwise this looks good to me.
Is this ticket missing from #32432?

Looks like a bug with lazy import and coercion:


```
sage: cm = coercion_model
sage: cm.analyse(RR, AA)
(['Coercion on right operand via',
  Conversion via _mpfr_ method map:
    From: Algebraic Real Field
    To:   Real Field with 53 bits of precision,
  'Arithmetic performed after coercions.'],
 Real Field with 53 bits of precision)
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.qqbar', ['AA', 'QQbar'])
sage: cm.analyse(RR, AA)
(['Right operand is not Sage element, will try _sage_.'], None)
```

I see four ways to deal with it:
- Resolve `LazyImport` somewhere in the coercion model.
- Add a custom `__instancecheck__` in `Parent`.
- Fix `parent(foo)`, when `foo` is a `LazyImport` instance.
- Accept this shortcoming of lazy imports and just revert the last commit (and comment that coercion with lazy imports does not work currently).

What do you think of it?

Thanks for investigating this! I've opened #32806 for this.

For the present ticket, I'll just revert the last commit and perhaps also get rid of use of `lazy_import` for the other imported parents in this file, for uniformity.
