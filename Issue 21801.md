The current method for finding the set of nonsurjective primes for a non-CM elliptic curve over Q is based on Cojocaru's bounds.  There is a more efficient algorithm by Zywina (see http://www.math.cornell.edu/~zywina/papers/EffectiveModl.pdf which contains the code in Magma -- very simple).  This would be easy to implement to replace (or provide an alternative algorithm for) the function nonsurjective() in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py

This should be closed as a duplicate of #11270 .

I will add a comment there about the current state of this.
