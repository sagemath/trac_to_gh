# Issue 24156: WeylGroup.subgroup is not a subset

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The following code

```
W = WeylGroup("A2", prefix="s")
s = W.simple_reflections()
H = W.subgroup([s[2]])
s[2] in list(H)
```


returns False. One workaround is `s[2] in list(W(x) for x in H)`.

Seems like a duplicate of #19010

I agree that this is essentially a duplicate of #19010 as the root cause is the same:

```
sage: W.has_coerce_map_from(H)
False
```

Every subgroup should have a coercion into its ambient group.
