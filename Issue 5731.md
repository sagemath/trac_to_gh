2009.04.08: Changes between NTL 5.4.2 and 5.5 from http://www.shoup.net/ntl/doc/tour-changes.html

* Added the ability to generate a shared library (with help from Tim Abbott). Details.
* Fixed some standardization issues (with help from Tim Abbot): default location of installed documentation files now conforms to standards; use of EOF now conforms to standards.
Added a callback mechanism to NTL's error reporting function. See ErrorCallback in tools.txt.
* Added support for the gf2x library for speeding up arithmetic in GF2X (with help from Emmanuel ThomÃ©).
  * In conjuction with the above, I also changed the GF2X so that it works better with very large polynomials: large blocks of memory are released, recursive HalfGCD algorithms are used for large polynomials.
* Fixed a bug in void TraceMod(zz_p& x, const zz_pX& a, const zz_pXModulus& F) (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed a performance issue in various versions of SetCoeff (reported by Luca De Feo).
* Fixed the declaration of mat_zz_p transpose(const mat_zz_p& a) (reported by Benoit Lacelle).

So we should be able to drop a couple custom patches.

Cheers,

Michael

Other than that I have no doubts that it works out of the box personally, and you save me from creating a spkg.

I started with a fresh build of 4.7.1.alpha0 which passes all tests;  built the new spkg here (with SAGE_CHECK=yes"); did "sage -ba" followed by "sage -t -long", and all tests pass.

The spkg itself is ok (though there's a typo "numbery" in the README, and William should probably not be the only spkg maintainer listed), so I am giving this a positive review and hop that it can go into the next alpha form 4.7.1.
