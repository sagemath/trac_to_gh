Currently the dilation of a polyhedron is done by computing the new double description from the new vertices.

With #28880 at hand, we can specify both Vrep and Hrep and the backend will use both (if available) or the shorter description. Either way, this will improve performance of polyhedra with many vertices but few facets (e.g. a hypercube).

Yep, for such changes, it is important to test with and without optional packages... otherwise, we tend to forget this. Good catch.
