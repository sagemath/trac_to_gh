Sorry, the issue I reported the last time is a non-issue (you just have to wait a bit longer for the Tee background process to notice that it's finished). 

But there is an amusing bug which I spotted when running a patchbot under 5.0.beta10. The function that compares version numbers just splits on "." and sorts alphabetically, and hence it thinks beta1 < beta10 < beta2! This caused a bunch of spurious "Apply Failed" warnings when it tried to apply patches from tickets that had already been merged (listed as dependencies of open tickets). See for example the first of the two runs for ticket #10527.

The fix is to add the lines


```python
a = a.replace("beta", "beta.")
b = b.replace("beta", "beta.")
```


to util.compare_versions.

The updated patch does that. (It also is a bit more strict about catching a `ValueError` when doing `int(s)`, which probably isn't a big deal, but it seems like a good idea.)

Is there a way how "state" could be preserved across patchbot runs?  Could it happen that the patchbot tests ticket X and somehow ticket X has a bug causing failures in *following* tickets the patchbot tests?  Because it looks like this is happening here.

I did 600 test runs of `maxima_abstract.py` on vanilla sage-5.1.beta2 and found no error.  Nobody has reported this bug on the mailing list and I haven't seen it on the buildbot with sage-5.1.beta2 or earlier.  So I conclude that the bug is introduced by a not-yet-merged ticket.

Since it is extremely unlikely that all the tickets in kini's list above cause the same bug, the most logical explanation is that somehow one ticket corrupted further patchbot runs.

Because we have always done things that way, and I don't see any reason why we should make an exception for the patchbot files.

Surely our installation/packaging procedure can be improved, but that's the topic of #13015, not of this ticket.

OK, I've pushed a new commit to make patchbot.py executable and make the hg commit a real commit. It's nit-picky stuff like this that in part made me want to avoid making an spkg. I'd much rather spend time improving or cleaning up the patchbot than worrying about packaging details as I've done over the last 7 (!) months since filing this ticket (whether as a patch or an spkg) but it's a real pain to not have this in. Basically, we need to move to a better system soon... OK, done ranting.

I also made it to qimport failing doesn't cause the ticket to fail.

And, to be clear, no offense to any of you intended, in fact I'm really grateful you're looking at this. It's the system that's to onerous.
