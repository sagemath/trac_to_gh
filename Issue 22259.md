# Issue 22259: Improve and fix documentation of Combinatorial or Discrete Geometry

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: doc, polyhedron, geometry, days84

The reference manual for the currently called _combinatorial geometry_ needs some logical reorganization.

[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html)

This ticket fixes the following:

 - add the normaliz backend to the references and add a note on how to install it
 - fixes an indentation that caused the documentation not to build
 - the section on hyperbolic geometry gets higher in the table of content, to _Geometry and Topology_.
 - the section on combinatorial geometry is renamed by adding also _Discrete_
 - the combinatorial geometry index is restructured logically.

Salut !

missing empty line here

```
+.. NOTE::
+    This backend requires `PyNormaliz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyNormaliz/1.5>`_.
```

and in several other places....

I would not give cones and fan "Toric Varieties" title, there are classes for these which are based on fans and cones. Also `lattice_polytope` logically fits with them better.

> I would not give cones and fan "Toric Varieties" title, there are classes for these which are based on fans and cones. 

I agree. I was sorting through the files and for the first version I put the 7 files whose documentation started with 

  This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties

together in a section called //Toric Varieties//.

Perhaps naming the section. //Lattices, Cones, Fans, and related objects// ? What do you think? Do you have any suggestions?

> Also `lattice_polytope` logically fits with them better.

Okay. Are there other modules that would logically go with them as well?

"Toric Geometry" may be appropriate, just no "varieties" themselves, I think.

Everything under "Lattice polyhedra" may be clamped with it - while there are presumably other reasons to consider them, almost everything here was done with toric geometry and mirror symmetry applications in mind.

Sounds good.

I could put it in the polyhedral computations section after the lattice polytopes, that would be good? One argument to keep "Toric geometry" in its own section is somehow to reflect a little bit the structure in the geometry component (although I admit it does not necessarily have to follow it...) since polyhedron is a module on its own and the toric geometry framework is located directly in geometry and not in polyhedron...

I'm fine with both.

A very related question (for another ticket, but it is good to have your opinion while you are at it) would be to move the isolated python files within `src/sage/geometry/` into some appropriate directory, like `riemannian_manifolds` for riemannian manifolds, `polyhedron` for polyhedra, etc.

The files to classify are:

* cone.py
* fan_isomorphism.py
* fan_morphism.py
* fan.py
* hasse_diagram.py
* integral_points.pyx
* lattice_polytope.py
* linear_expression.py
* newton_polygon.py
* point_collection.pyx
* pseudolines.py
* ribbon_graph.py
* toric_lattice_element.pyx
* toric_lattice.py
* toric_plotter.py

Would make sense to have `src/sage/geometry/toric` similar to `src/sage/schemes/toric` with files
* cone.py
* fan_isomorphism.py
* fan_morphism.py
* fan.py
* lattice_polytope.py
* point_collection.pyx
* toric_lattice_element.pyx
* toric_lattice.py
* toric_plotter.py

OK great, having such a `src/sage/geometry/toric` would be a good step toward cleaning up `src/sage/geometry` !

Okay. I would say that it is ready to be reviewed again.

doctest passed on :
- src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py
- src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py	
- src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/constructor.py

build of the doc passed and page discrete_geometry/index.html looks conform.
