CC:  moritz mkoeppe vdelecroix tmonteil chapoton

Keywords: doc, polyhedron, geometry, days84

The reference manual for the currently called *combinatorial geometry* needs some logical reorganization.

[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html)

This ticket fixes the following:

- add the normaliz backend to the references and add a note on how to install it
- fixes an indentation that caused the documentation not to build
- the section on hyperbolic geometry gets higher in the table of content, to *Geometry and Topology*.
- the section on combinatorial geometry is renamed by adding also *Discrete*
- the combinatorial geometry index is restructured logically.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22496

I agree. I was sorting through the files and for the first version I put the 7 files whose documentation started with 

  This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties

together in a section called //Toric Varieties//.

Perhaps naming the section. //Lattices, Cones, Fans, and related objects// ? What do you think? Do you have any suggestions?

> Also `lattice_polytope` logically fits with them better.

Okay. Are there other modules that would logically go with them as well?

"Toric Geometry" may be appropriate, just no "varieties" themselves, I think.

Everything under "Lattice polyhedra" may be clamped with it - while there are presumably other reasons to consider them, almost everything here was done with toric geometry and mirror symmetry applications in mind.

Sounds good.

I'm fine with both.

A very related question (for another ticket, but it is good to have your opinion while you are at it) would be to move the isolated python files within `src/sage/geometry/` into some appropriate directory, like `riemannian_manifolds` for riemannian manifolds, `polyhedron` for polyhedra, etc.

The files to classify are:

* cone.py
* fan_isomorphism.py
* fan_morphism.py
* fan.py
* hasse_diagram.py
* integral_points.pyx
* lattice_polytope.py
* linear_expression.py
