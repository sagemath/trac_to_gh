The patch is OK, but you should add the name of the method to the list of families of graphs (table at the begining of file `graph_generators.py`).

My mistake, it is in the list.
However, why not using the same convention than for other graph generators, i.e., `ChangGraphs` instead of `chang_graphs` ?

Hellooooooooo,

> However, why not using the same convention than for other graph generators, i.e., `ChangGraphs` instead of `chang_graphs` ?

I followed the "convention" that the code seems to follow about functions which return *several* graphs: ` fusenes/planar_graph/trees/triangulations/line_graph_forbidden_subgraphs/cospectral_graphs/...`. There is not a single "Graphs" but several "graphs" already.

IMHO it still must be Chang (it's a person, whereas cospectral is not!), not chang...

And, by the way, switching: #18972 - not completely done, but still :-)
