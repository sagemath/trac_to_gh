# Issue 13522: The semimonomial group

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13726

Original creator: tfeulner

Keywords: (semi-)monomial group, semilinear action, isometry group

A semimonomial group over a ring `R` of length `n` is equal to the wreath product of the monomial group and the group of ring automorphisms. The multiplication of two elements `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta)` with

 * `\phi, \psi \in  {R<sup>*}</sup>n`
 * `\pi, \sigma \in S_n`
 * `\alpha, \beta \in Aut(R)`

is defined by:
   `(\phi, \pi, \alpha)(\psi, \sigma, \beta) := (\phi * \psi^{\pi, \alpha}, \pi * \sigma, \alpha * \beta)`  
with
   `\psi^{\pi, \alpha} := (\alpha^{-1}(\psi_{\pi(0} ) ), \ldots, \alpha^{-1}(\psi_{\pi(n-1} ) ) )` 
and an elementwisely defined multiplication of vectors.

This group plays an important role in coding theory since it is the group of all semilinear isometries (relative to the Hamming/Lee/homogenous metric) of the ambient space.

Made some changes which were necessary for #13771. In particular, I changed the definition of the multiplication.

Hmm... I can only suggest minor cosmetic changes. Someone else needs to look at the math behind what you implemented.

* Your `_element_class` method doesn't do anything non-trivial, its simpler to use 
  {{{
class SemimonomialGroup(...):
    Element = SemimonomialGroupElement
  }}}
  instead.

* Your parent overrides `__call__`, thats a big no-no in our parent/element framework. By default, calling the parent will end up using `SeminmonomialGroupElement.__init__`. If you need to normalize arguments, you should implement a `SemimonomialGroup._element_constructor_` method. See e.g. Simon King's talk at http://wiki.sagemath.org/days53/schedule for details. (This should be better documented in the developer manual, I know).

* Also run the testsuite for elements, e.g. `TestSuite(S.an_element()).run()`

* It would be nice to have exceptions in py3-compatible syntax (this should also go into the developer manual) and lower-case:
  {{{
    raise Exception, 'This is a boo-boo'   # bad
    raise Exception('this is a boo-boo')   # good
  }}}

* Is `SemimonomialGroup` really used in the literature? A quick googling doesn't find any other references. Its a bit confusing since you are not talking about a generalization of monomial groups. The latter is already quite general, e.g. every supersolvable group. Perhaps `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be a more fitting description? Or is there another characterization? I realize that thats a handful, but it could be made available as `LinearCode.AutomorphismGroup`, say.

* Storing the translation in a list is tricky as the user might inadvertently change it 
  {{{
    sage: g = my_group.gen(0)
    sage: v = g.get_v()
    ... 
    sage: v[0] = 1   # changes g!
  }}}
  To hold immutable data, its better to use tuples. Alternatively, use Sage vectors and set them immutable:
  {{{
    sage: v = vector(GF(3), [0, 1, 2])
    sage: v.set_immutable()
    sage: v[0] = 1
    ...
    ValueError: vector is immutable; please change a copy instead (use copy())
  }}}

I made all the changes you suggested except for renaming the group.

There are a few other references, for example T. Honold and I. Landjev: Linear codes over finite chain rings. But mostly, people do either restrict themselves to linear isometries, which leads to the action of the monomial group or they don't express the equivalence relation with the help of a group action (semilinearly equivalent codes).

I do not understand the rest of your comment. This group *is* a generalization of the monomial group, since you just add the group of field automorphisms, similar to the construction of the general semilinear group. I think `AutomorphismGroupOfLinearCode` would be confusing, since the elements of this group need not to define an automorphism of a linear code. The automorphism group of a linear code is a subgroup of the semimonomial group.

Another characterization would be the group of semilinear Hamming isometries.

Here is what I'm confused about. A monomial group is one where all characters are induced from linear characters. Although I haven't checked, it seems very plausible that the group of monomial transformations is a monomial group. But I don't think the converse is true. E.g. S_3 is a monomial group

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(3).is_monomial()
True
```

but doesn't seem to be the group of monomial automorphisms of a vector space (Is this true?).

I did not find any answer to your question. But the wreath product G \wr S_n is known as the
_complete monomial group_. So, do you think I should call my group  
`CompleteSemimonomialGroup` or `SemimonomialTransformationGroup` to emphasize the difference?

The symmetric group S_n is the group of monomial automorphisms of the n-dimensional binary vector space.

I think either name would be fine. `SemimonomialTransformationGroup` sounds clearer to me since it makes it clear that we are talking about groups acting in a certain way. Though if people in your field always talk about complete monomial groups then the former might be better, I don't know. Take your pick ;-)

> The symmetric group S_n is the group of monomial automorphisms of the n-dimensional binary vector space.

Oh, good point. I was somehow assuming that there is at least one non-trivial unit.

Small nitpicks:
  * In general it is better to use lazy import to improve the Sage startup time: 
    {{{
lazy_import('sage.groups.semimonomial_group.semimonomial_group',
            'SemimonomialGroup')
    }}}
    in `sage/groups/all.py`. Then the actual import is deferred until you use it.
  * incidentally, the change to `sage/groups/all.py` doesn't apply cleanly on sage-5.13.beta0 and needs to be rediffed anyways.
  * Add also `semimonomial_group_element` to the developer manual.

The code looks great, thank you for your hard work!

Unfortunately, people do not use group actions in coding theory... I also prefer _semimonomial transformation group_ and _semimonomial transformation_ for the elements. So, I changed the class names to these names.

Done.

Is this my job, too?

Thanks for all your help, Volker!

Afraid so... depending on how complicated it is, the author should be the most qualified to do this. Though it its pretty trivial here.
