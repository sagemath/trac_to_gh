```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: S = Sequence([x*y*z+x*y+z*y+x*z, x+y+z+1, x+y])
sage: S.eliminate_linear_variables(return_reductors=True)
[z + 1], [x + y + z + 1])
```

Obviously, the first part is linear, and it shouldn't. The result should have been:

```
( [], [z + 1, x + y] )
```

The patch repairs the function, along with the following changes:

* by default, the threshold for the size of the tail changes from 3 to +infinity (3 was completely arbitrary anyway)
* the linear reductors form a **reduced** groebner basis (i.e. they are in RREF).

a bit nitpicky but I think it should read `skip is None` instead of `skip==None. But I think other than that the patch looks good.`
