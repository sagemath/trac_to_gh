CC:  @tobiasdiez @dimpase

These environments would just run `sudo apt-get ...` etc. to install (but not remove!) packages, for use at the user's own risk.

To test (on an Ubuntu system):

```
    tox -e local-sudo-ubuntu-bionic-standard
```
or

```
    tox -e local-sudo-standard
```

Is it possible to put the sudo outside? I.e. `sudo tox -r local-ubuntu-standard`?

I think you forgot the confirmation `-y` after `install`: https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/commit/942149ee76a97628046042b7255a2d31630e7721

Moreover, I was wondering if one should also read the `debian-bootstrap.txt` files.

Finally, there are problems that some of the packages are not found. First, one should probably add `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` since otherwise `libpython3.7-dev` is not found on ubuntu 20.04. Second, `texlive-generic-extra` doesn't exist on ubuntu 20.04.

Other than that, looks good to me! Thanks a lot.

Yes, I'll add bootstrap

I don't think we have `libpython3.7-dev` listed in the debian.txt files any more.

But yes, handling `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` needs to be done.

For deadsnakes, there's #30217. This would not be the default, but a mix-in flavor.

Sure, but it feels a bit like you are using tox for something it wasn't designed. Normally, in a tox setting, "environment" refers to a virtual python env, but for sage it is the complete system env including the os and system packages. I have the feeling a more general-purpose framework like invoke would be a better solution to manage these things.

I didn't meant it as a user-facing script, but only for developers (i.e don't ship it).

Is it possible to call only the system package install code via tox (i.e. don't run rest of build and tests)? 

That would be handy for #30371.

Yes, you can pass make targets to tox, e.g., `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- configure` will only run `bootstrap`, or `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- config.status` will stop after running `./configure`

It would be nice if you could try to make it work without sudo.

Can you make a separate ticket for that? Once a ticket is in positive review I'll only unmerge it for critical bugs, not things that would also be good to have.
