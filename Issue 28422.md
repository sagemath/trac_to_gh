CC:  tscrim soehms

The ticket #28631 introduced a vastly incomplete factorization of polynomials in the universal cyclotomic field.

```
{{{
sage: (x**2 - 3).factor()
x^2 - 3
sage: r = UCF(3).sqrt()
sage: r
E(12)^7 - E(12)^11
sage: (x - r) * (x + r)
x^2 - 3
}}}
```

The simplest is to revert all changes.

I would prefer to have an implementation of `_factor_univariate_polynomial` remaining. Two reasons for this I've given in #28631#comment:7
Another reason is to prevent developers in future of not becoming aware that there is a serious reason that the implementation of factorization over UCF  
is avoided in general (since it is a non trivial task).

This could be achieved by the following bug-fix of #28631:


```diff
         if len(F) == 1:
+            if cycl_pol.degree() > 1:
+                raise NotImplementedError('Cannot factor this polynomial' )
             return F

```


in addition with a doc-test for this ticket (with the example of the description)!

Your version is also "broken" on

```
((x^2 + x + 1)**2).factor()
```


I will try to make a reasonable partial implementation and add a note why this is non trivial.

Here is a more reasonable fix. It factorizes into product of linear forms as long as it is a product of cyclotomic polynomials and degree 2 factors.

The case of degree 3 should be doable "by hand". For higher degree, one needs to go through more Galois theory.

Thanks for your agreement and for improving the implementation more than I expected! Indeed, transferring the problem to the cyclotomic fields was no good idea!
It is more reasonable (and surely more performant) to restrict to rational polynomials and do calculations inside the UCF, as you did. But maybe you should change the comment above that restriction:

`find a common cyclotomic field for the coefficients and change base ring`

since it might be misleading now. If this is done, you may switch to positive review!
