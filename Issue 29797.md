The description of the function ramification_index (and the function e) was copied from the function "index", and was not changed: 


```
sage: F=Qp(5)
sage: F.ramification_index?
Signature:      F.ramification_index()
Docstring:     
   Return the degree of this extension.

```


I am fixing this to learn how to use git+trac.
