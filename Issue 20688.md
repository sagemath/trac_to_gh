I've sent the author a pm, there doesn't seem to be a public upstream bug tracker.

Hum, we have a patch for that in sage right now. It must have been fixed in another ticket.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
