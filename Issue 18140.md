AHahah. Well... You have to become a git wizard `:-P`

It is not very complicated, though, as the name of the branch from #18296 still appears on the ticket: public/18296

You just have to merge your current branch with `public/18296`, and solve the conflicts that it will cause. Tell me if I am being too general. And if you do, please tell me how you use git (git trac? dev scripts? manually?)

Yooooooo !

> I hope this is correct ?

You did well.

> Never sure which way to merge..

As far as I know, the world is split between those who don't care on one side, and those who care but cannot tell you when it actually matters.
