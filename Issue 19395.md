Hello Dima,

I do not even understand how you can use this 'partition' argument given that it is read *after* a call to relabel(), and that this is, in theory at least, architecture dependent.

Are you saying that relabel() can reorder vertices? Indeed, the code depends on it keeping them 
in the same order.

'reorder' ? Nono, it will not 'reorder' them, i.e. the ith vertex of g.vertices() is the ith vertex of g.vertices() after a relabel


```
        if perm is None:
            perm = dict({v:i for i,v in enumerate(self.vertices())})
```


But if you have to explain in the doc what exactly the ith vertex represents when he provides a partition, well, we might as well use their original labels (i.e. before relabelling)

`partition` is partition of the points of the underlying `hyperoval` (not a partition of vertices). 

```
   * "partition" -- if "None" (default), pair each i-th point of
     "hyperoval" with (i+1)-th. Otherwise, specifies the pairing in
     the format ((i_1,i'_1),(i_2,i'_2),...).

   * "hyperoval" -- a hyperoval defining T_2^*(q)^*. If "None"
     (default), the classical hyperoval obatined from a conic is used.

Hello Dima,

As the end of december is coming fast, I started this review before the next beta. I added a commit at public/19632 that cleans a couple of things, and simplifies some code too. It would be really great if you could start thinking of what your computer does when you give it instructions, because a lot of computations was done for nothing.

Two remarks:

- For me the following doctest is too long, even for a "#long" doctest. Recently some guys were trying to figure out how to do something like "#long 2m" doctests for a better filtering.


```
sage: %time g=graphs.HaemersGraph(8); g
CPU times: user 11.1 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 11.1 s
Wall time: 11.1 s
```


- It seems that `partition` is not a partition of the vertex set but a partition of ... a partition of G into independent sets. Would it be possible to change the terminology a bit to avoid confusion?

Thanks,

Nathann
