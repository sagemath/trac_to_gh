I'm not fully satisfied of this patch, but I have no better implementation in mind.

For digraphs, this patch considers weakly connected components, but it could also considers strongly connected components. I'm not sure of the most relevant definition.

I tried using blocks and cut vertices to write is_cut_vertex, but it appears to be much slower (as expected).  I'm not sure of a better way to implement this.

The tests all ran fine, maybe it's a good idea to add a digraphs test/example?

There is major problem with this patch. It modifies the given graph.

While it tries to revert the effect, this is still a bad idea. If an exception occurs between the removal of the vertex and the addition of the edges then the graph will end up modified (just think of CTRL+C or out of memory).

Also the reversal doesn't work for directed graphs currently. Just check the number of edges of D in your test case.

I'd argue that you shouldn't try to fix the reversal, but get rid of it. I don't now much about the problem, so can't suggest a better algorithm that what a quick google search would reveal. If you can't find a better algorithm, make a copy of the graph and modify this copy.

IIRC they are both implemented as hash maps, which should make the set faster. I think it has something to do with the fact that the "v in s" has to catch the KeyError and return False instead of just raising the exception. That's exactly what happens with your dict here. It doesn't catch KeyError, but that's fine because it never occurs. Making it faster.

In contrast, if you let it catch the exception aka "seen.get(w, False)", the dict is a lot slower.

Good idea.

Once I checked the manual and ptestlong, I'll give it a positive review.

Ouppss. This is solved in this new version. I'm using a set of vertices to restrict the DFS to the vertices in the connected or strongly connected component containing u.

I have also restored the `seen = set([start, u])` instead of a dict since only a subset of the vertices are now considered. In fact I don't know if it has a real impact on the performances, but it reduces initialization cost per loop.

I hope everything is in order now ;-)

Don't forget to put your name as reviewer.

Is this really necessary for the undirected case? Aren't all neighbors of v in the same connected component as v?
