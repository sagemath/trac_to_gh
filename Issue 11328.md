Keywords: plot3d

When creating several layers that interpolate between two surfaces, only one layer is output when accumulating the layers via a loop.  No problem if the layers are explicitly coded.

In the looped version, it appears that the plot3d commands are only executed at show() time and therefore only use the final value of the loop parameter.  All of the layers are created on top of each other at that final parameter value.

Example worksheet is attached.

I agree that it is confusing.  I'm trying to decide if it is "wrong".

Okay, after thinking about it and discussing this with KDC, I think the current behavior is wrong. I agree with kcrisman that the plot3d command should "freeze" the variables by creating a closure (or a fast_callable object) when it stores the function.
