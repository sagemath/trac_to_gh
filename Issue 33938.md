Keywords: gsoc2022

The `global_height` for polynomials would fail when passed the zero polynomial, since `number_of_terms` would return 0, and then it would create a projective space of dimension -1:


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = 0 * x
sage: f.global_height()
error
```


This ticket aims to fix this.
