```
sage: d = DynkinDiagram()
sage: d.add_edge(1,2,3)
sage: d.add_edge(2,3)
sage: d.add_edge(3,4,3) 
sage: d.cartan_matrix()
[ 2 -1  0  0]
[-3  2 -1  0]
[ 0 -1  2 -1]
[ 0  0 -3  2]
sage: Q = d.root_system().root_lattice()
sage: Q
Root lattice of the Root system of type Dynkin diagram of rank 4
sage: al = Q.simple_roots()
sage: al[1].reflection(al[2]) # Boom
```

This shouldn't be too hard to fix, just check if the Cartan type is `None` (where applicable) and if so, call the corresponding Cartan matrix.

I fixed this by giving a method `symmetrizer` to the Dynkin diagrams. This uncovered another small bug in that the index set wasn't being taking from the Dynkin diagram (i.e. its vertices) which is also fixed here.

Looks good to me, but maybe one could add a test for the index_set correct behavior ?

It's implicitly there in the symmetrizer test, but I'll add an explicit test.
