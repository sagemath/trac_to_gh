The following consistently fails with sage-4.7.2.alpha2:

 1. Create new worksheet, call it `GFhelp`

 1. In the worksheet, execute the following and wait for completion:

```
GF?
```


 1. Close the worksheet

 1. Reopen the worksheet `GFhelp`

 1. Re-execute `GF?` by simply typing `SHIFT-ENTER`.

Now the worksheet totally hangs.

I can reproduce this with on a current flack notebook an Sage 4.7.1, and current flack notebook+twisted 11 on Sage 4.7
(our NTU nutmeg server).

I assume by "execute the following and wait for completion" you mean evaluate, not Tab-complete.
(In the latter case nothing wrong happens).

Replicated again with the current flask notebook (at least from 2 weeks ago).

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
