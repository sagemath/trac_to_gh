This works, and nobody knows..

Let us give a simple example.

I have also cleaned up the code (just some pep8 changes)

Doctests pass, documentation builds. Code cleanup looks good.

The new example looks nice, but why the tachyon viewer?

well, why not ? do you want me to remove the viewer="tachyon" ?

Yes please. I find it preferable that 3D examples use the best possible viewer available to the system.

Positive review after that. Thanks!
