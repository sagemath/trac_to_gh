Follow up from #27705.

A warning should be shown, perhaps already at the end of the configure phase.

Of course, we will need to be careful regarding the macOS SSL problems.

I guess if we can't find systems without the Python module ssl already installed, maybe we should just merge it and move on?

Right, I'm not aware of a distribution whose python would be missing the ssl module. The new configuration tests here on the ticket protect against broken pythons compiled by users. The most likely scenario could be that a user configures the source from within the `sage -sh` of some old installation of Sage.
