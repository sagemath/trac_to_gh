`ptestalllong` gets 6 transient and 3 permanent failures :

All of these have already been reported for previous release(s) of Python 3-based Sage 9 betas, and therefore considered not to be related to this ticket.

==> `positive_review`

Given the importance of this ticket (a //large// headache off the shoulders of active Sage-R users...), I recommend tests on other platforms (Mac OS X and its shenanigans, Windows and the coexistence of Windows and Cygwin libraries...).

It works on MacOS 10.13.6 with Homebrew's R and openblas packages.

It doesn't work with R installed with standalone isntaller from R Project,
probably as there is some kind of library/compiler incompatibility - they don't build R with Xcode compiler, they use their "own"; more precisely, OpenMP-enabled
clang 8, see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools.
Somehow I see an error message while building rpy2, attempting to use `-fopenmp` switch with Xcode's clang.
