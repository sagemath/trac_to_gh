Keywords: cactus

We implement the cactus group *J*<sub>n</sub> (of type A). The cactus group has important applications in category and representation theory.

This group is not available in GAP as far as I can tell.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19594

There seems to be something wrong with the relations you provide.I am trying to check that you indeed have a homomorphism from J_4 to Sym(4), but GAP returns `fail`. Does your code check that your map is a group homomorphism?

`s14 |-> (1,4) (2,3)` is the correct image as `s14` should correspond to flipping the entire interval `[1, 4]`.

I asked Peter Tingley, who asked Joel Kamnitzer, and they do not know of a normal form.

What do both of you think about trying to prove an analog of Matsumoto's theorem for the cactus group, i.e., that all reduced words are related to each other by just applying the defining relations, as per comment:15?

What I ended up doing on this ticket is just iterating over the ambient group J<sub>n</sub> and returning the element in the kernel.

I am guessing it would be too much to ask for a Garside-type structure coming from the projection onto S<sub>n</sub>, where every element can be written as `xy^k` where `x` is the natural section of S<sub>n</sub> and `y` is some special element in J<sub>n</sub> (similar to a normal form for the braid group elements, where `y` corresponds to the section of the long element).

Are you thinking that there might be reduced expressions which require using the `x^2 = 1` identity to add letters temporarily to get between them for n > 4?

I'm also emailing Joel and Peter about possible assistance we might get from geometric information.

According to R.

Yea, but here I think we are closer to the Coxeter group than the braid group (and even have a representation to test). Yet, I do agree that this could be a hard thing to prove.

Daan Krammer has constructed an analogue of the Tits representation for the cactus groups.
He proves this is faithful. The preprint version is:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1273.pdf

[You need to leave out the six term relations.]

Is there a class for permutation representations of a finitely presented group?

I implemented the action on highest weight words in the tensor power of a crystal many years ago
(using the Henriques-Kamnitzer definition).
