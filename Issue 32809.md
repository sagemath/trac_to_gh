# Issue 32809: gap spkg creates absolute symlinks

In `gap/spkg-install` two absolute symlinks are created; this confuses packagers and relocation.

The current ticket replaces them by relative symlinks.

All the paths involved are hardcoded in this file (even `SAGE_BIN`), so nothing external can affect it.

this needs to be tested on macOS, which is notoriously fiddly with these things.
And on cygwin.
