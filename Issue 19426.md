Sublinking in arb. Moreover, fplll lings to gmp and mpfr, so the order of libraries in module_list.py should be changed accordingly.

LGTM for arb. However, I think there is an issue with Pynac linking to GMP:

```
.libs/libpynac_la-numeric.o: In function `ZN5GiNaC7numericD2Ev':
/home/Travis/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.5.2/src/ginac/numeric.cpp:621:
 undefined reference to `_imp____gmpq_clear'
```

Full log has been attached.

OK, must be new from beta7. I will fix this once I am back in France, in one week.

You can open a new ticket for the `pynac` build failure.
