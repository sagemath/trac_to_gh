# Issue 31695: crash in desolve

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31932

Original creator: @juergenuhl

Original creation time: 2021-06-08 08:42:09

I'm using [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.2, Release Date: 2020-10-24 on Windows 10.

var('t g m c')\\
r=function('r')(t)\\
de=diff(r)+sqrt(-2*g*r + 10*g + 2/5*c/m - 2*c/(m*r))\\
desolve(de,[r,t])

crashes the system (the console just closes).

confirmed on linux too with 9.6.beta2

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to symbolics.

Changing keywords from "" to "desolve, crash".

This simplified example gives the same failure::

```
sage: a, b, c, t = SR.var('a, b, c, t')
sage: r = function('r')(t)
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b + c/r)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: ECL says: BINDING-STACK overflow at size 10240.
Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```

By contrast:

```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
-2*sqrt(a*r(t) + b)/a == _C + t
```


```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a*r + b/t)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Maxima was unable to solve this ODE.
Consider to set option contrib_ode to True.
```


```
sage: de = diff(r, t) + sqrt(a + b/t)
sage: desolve(de, r, ivar=t)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional
constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation
*may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(a>0)', see
`assume?` for more details) Is a positive or negative?
```
