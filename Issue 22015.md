```

Okay, the PDF docs build for me after adding `\usepackage{iftex}` to the preamble, without any other changes to the current branch, and in particular without the "huge tex" changes from previous versions.

On my Gentoo system, I never managed to built the Japanese PDF documentation (any ideas, fbissey?) with or without this patch:

```
[docpdf] /bin/sh: extractbb: command not found

So I can make changes to the `\ifPDFTeX` thing but I'll have to do it "in the dark" without actually being able to check it.

On my OS X machine, `extractbb` seems to be part of TeXLive 2016, and is just a symlink to `xdvipdfmx`:

```
$ ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/universal-darwin/extractbb

I should check that I can build it now. I changed system so I am starting from a cleaner slate. I used to have problem with russian documentation because of tex fonts problems. According to my ebuild I need the following from tex

```
L10N="ca de en fr hu it ja pt ru tr" USE=extra emerge -1Nv texlive
```

 I usually do 

```
VARTEX=$somelocations make doc-pdf
```

Gentoo doesn't install "unfolded" russian (and japanese?) tex fonts. If you don't specify VARTEX, it may try to do it in a system location.

The same `missfont.log` file is in `ja/a_tour_of_sage`. If I uncomment `%f cid-x.map` then everything builds. I'm not sure what's up but I can make the pdfs to build. I guess it's possible that since I didn't do

```

I manually installed the packages - that that could be the difference? The only difference on my system is that `app-text/texlive-2015` would be rebuilt with `L10N="ca* de* en fr hu* it* ja* pt* ru* tr*`. But all the extra languages are installed.

Sorry for the noise Jeroen. We wanted to be sure we had the dependencies right.

My own experience here is that:
1) doc, including pdf and japanese pdf, in particular, build fine
2) it does so with or without `latex_memory.patch` so I guess we can drop it - unless someone has a different experience.

I am happy for this ticket to be sent to the bots once the offending patch is removed - or someone shows it is needed in some cases.
