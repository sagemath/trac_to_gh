Could we add an example with the `.. PLOT::` directive? Otherwise LGTM as an alternative to the latex version.

I also had some fun with this:

```
sage: im = [DyckWords(100).random_element().plot(color=c, aspect_ratio=1) for c in sage.plot.colors.rainbow(150)]
sage: a = animate(im, aspect_ratio=1, ymax=25)
sage: a.show()
Launched gif viewer for Animation with 150 frames
```
