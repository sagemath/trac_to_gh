`with` doesn't catch exceptions: exceptions in `__enter__` are just raised as usual.

This script is written with the assumption that it doesn't get run on its own but instead via `sage-spkg`. Any errors in this script will result in an error message from `sage-spkg`. So while we could add more error-checking, I don't think it's really necessary.

Strangely, `with` already appears in python 2.5 as a feature, and it is always on in 2.6.

Are sure you are fixing the right bug (that is to say, did you reproduce this on your python 2.6?)
