Example of problem


```
sage: var ('x y z A B C')
sage: f  = A*x + C*y^B
sage: solve(f==0, y)
```

returns


```
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: ECL says: Maxima asks: Is B an integer?
```

At the very least this should return a message more like those in sage/symbolic/integration/integration.py. Something along the lines of: "Solve failed because Maxima requested contraints; using the 'assume' command before 'solve' may help (e.g. 'assume( B, 'integer')').  See 'assume?' for more info." The Maxima error should also be passed on.

However, I would prefer to see the general symbolic solution unless numeric values are assigned to the variables in the expression.  Note that 'assume(B, 'integer') gives what I consider the correct general symbolic expression:


```
sage: var ('x y z A B C')
sage: f  = A*x + C*y^B
sage: assume(B, 'integer')
sage: solve(f==0, y) 
[y == (-A*x/C)^(1/B)]
```

I'm hoping somebody with experience with the symbolics package can work on this.  That said, I find this very annoying and may try to work on it later this summer.  At which point I'm likely to do something that would break symbolics....;)

`desolve` also does this (gives unfriendly errors when requesting assumptions).

The error message is now much better:

```
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(B>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is B an integer?
```


So I guess this is fixed.
