The methods `weak_popov_form` and `row_reduced_form` currently appear on any matrix. But they only make sense form matrices over `k(x)` or `k[x]`.

The patch partially moves `weak_popov_form`-related methods to a new file `matrix_polynomial_dense.pyx`. It is partial because the current `weak_popov_form` and `row_reduced_form` methods also works for polynomials over `k(x)` not only over `k[x]`. But I think these methods are basically only for matrices over `k[x]`. Thus the left-over methods in `matrix2.pyx` and `matrix_misc.py` should be removed later by dropping support for matrices  over `k(x)`.

How one can "take copyrights" when he/she added code to a file? I don't understand...

Hi Kwankyu,
Thanks for looking at this again!

I agree that the existing weak Popov algorithm should just be removed, the algorithm should not support `k(x)` matrices but only `k[x]`.

I am surprised that the implementation of #16742 is so slow, but I can confirm your conclusion. David Mödinger was hired by me for a short while to produce that code, and at the time I know he convinced me that his timings were better than my own implementation. However retesting now, the implementation in [Codinglib](https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib) beats both his and your implementation by a wide margin. In particular, it seems your implementation becomes slow for large, low-degree matrices, since you iterate over, potentially, the whole matrix after every simple transformation:


```
 ---- Timing test: Big matrix ---- 
Codinglib 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 2.15060825348
Klee 60 x 60 with deg 20 took on average 17.5283669949
```


The above test was done by creating matrices which are extremely far from being row reduced: let `A, B` be two random lower-triangular matrices with 1 on the diagonal and everything else has high degree. Then we compute the weak Popov form of `A*B.transpose()`.

We can deprecate the support for `k(x)` in this ticket.

Can we also not just throw away the old, slow `_row_reduced_form` algorithm, and simply make `row_reduced_form` an alias of `weak_popov_form`? (the alias makes sense as there might later be faster algorithms for computing just a `row_reduced_form`, particularly in a future release of LinBox).

Why not? Your code is already equipped with it. You need to just add some examples. 

Please also add your name to AUTHORS, to the code and to this ticket.

Did I say it? Your implementation is clear winner! :-)

OK, cool. Since we're at it, I think we should also:

1. Remove deprecations from #16896 and cleanup the related code (this ticket won't be in a stable release before the deprecation period runs out).
2. Add support for shifts, as you suggest.
3. Remove the old `row_reduced_form` algorithm and just call Mulders--Storjohann.

I'm pretty tied up this week, but I can try to get these last things done.
Best,
