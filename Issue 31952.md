# Issue 31952: Remove last mentions of database_gap

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32189

In #26856, all the GAP packages previously shipped
in the `database_gap` optional spkg were made part
of the `gap` standard spkg, and the `database_gap`
spkg was removed.

A few `# optional - database_gap` doctest tags were
inadvertently reintroduced in commit 3efc05e62d24,
which appeared in #25902 and was adopted in #28782.

This ticket removes these doctest tags.

Oops, typo "GAP uses needs" -> "GAP uses".
Let's also leave a note about TransGrp
being previously provided by "database_gap"
for the sake of users of Sage <= 8.5 reading
the online documentation.

Do you agree with these changes?

I don't think we need to leave this note. Could you give a little more justification of your rationale? If someone is jumping from 8.5, they will experience that many things have changed. I feel like this adds some clutter. Perhaps you could answer at which point should it be removed?

Removed the note that added clutter:

```
Up to Sage 8.5, "TransGrp" was available in Sage via the
"database_gap" optional Sage package, removed in :trac:`22626`
as its content became part of the "gap" standard Sage package.
```

Please review.
