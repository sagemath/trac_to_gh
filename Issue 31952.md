CC:  @xcaruso @roed314 @slel @tscrim

In #26856, all the GAP packages previously shipped
in the `database_gap` optional spkg were made part
of the `gap` standard spkg, and the `database_gap`
spkg was removed.

A few `# optional - database_gap` doctest tags were
inadvertently reintroduced in commit 3efc05e62d24,
which appeared in #25902 and was adopted in #28782.

This ticket removes these doctest tags.

Oops, typo "GAP uses needs" -> "GAP uses".

I don't think we need to leave this note. Could you give a little more justification of your rationale? If someone is jumping from 8.5, they will experience that many things have changed. I feel like this adds some clutter. Perhaps you could answer at which point should it be removed?
