Keywords: Galois group

It should be possible to construct a subgroup of the Galois group of a number field from a set of generators, just as for permutation groups.  This is already supported to some extent, but the list of elements of such a subgroup is wrong.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = x^6 - 6*x^4 + 9*x^2 + 23
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(f)
sage: G = K.galois_group()
sage: list(G)
[(),
 (1,2,3)(4,5,6),
 (1,3,2)(4,6,5),
 (1,4)(2,6)(3,5),
 (1,5)(2,4)(3,6),
 (1,6)(2,5)(3,4)]
sage: g = G[1]
sage: h = G[3]
```

Before:

```
sage: list(G.subgroup([]))
[]
sage: list(G.subgroup([g]))
[(1,2,3)(4,5,6)]
sage: list(G.subgroup([h]))
[(1,4)(2,6)(3,5)]
sage: list(G.subgroup([g,h]))
[(1,2,3)(4,5,6), (1,4)(2,6)(3,5)]
```

After:

```
sage: list(G.subgroup([]))
[()]
sage: list(G.subgroup([g]))
[(), (1,2,3)(4,5,6), (1,3,2)(4,6,5)]
sage: list(G.subgroup([h]))
[(), (1,4)(2,6)(3,5)]
sage: list(G.subgroup([g,h]))
[(),
 (1,2,3)(4,5,6),
 (1,3,2)(4,6,5),
 (1,4)(2,6)(3,5),
 (1,5)(2,4)(3,6),
 (1,6)(2,5)(3,4)]
```
