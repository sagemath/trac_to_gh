Ginac includes an implementation of polylogarithms. The numeric methods of this implementation is commented out in the pynac source since it tries to call the `CLN` library directly, but the other parts should work.

We should expose these functions (with a name other than `Li`).

An example of how this can be done is available in #8864.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10050

}
```

note that there are issues with the current polylog function:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
```
The first command should not evaluate symbolically, since the input 1.0 is a floating-point.
The second command should evaluate numerically, like for example `bessel_J(2,0.9)`.

Should I open a separate ticket?

At the moment Pynac calls `symbolic/pynac.pyx:py_li()` which calls `mpmath`. It is not clear to me why the outcommented pynac code would be needed, to remove the call overhead? If you replace the CLN dependency, with what MPFR?, how would this be better or faster than mpmath?

Proposed to be invalid. If you agree I would reword this ticket to fix the mentioned bugs only.
