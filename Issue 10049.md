# Issue 10049: wrap the polylogarithm functions from pynac

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: burcin

Original creation time: 2010-10-01 21:01:26

Assignee: burcin

Keywords: beginner

Ginac includes an implementation of polylogarithms. The numeric methods of this implementation is commented out in the pynac source since it tries to call the `CLN` library directly, but the other parts should work.

We should expose these functions (with a name other than `Li`).

An example of how this can be done is available in #8864.

note that there are issues with the current polylog function:

```
sage: polylog(2,1.0)
1/6*pi^2
sage: polylog(2,0.9)
polylog(2, 0.900000000000000)
```

The first command should not evaluate symbolically, since the input 1.0 is a floating-point.
The second command should evaluate numerically, like for example `bessel_J(2,0.9)`.

Should I open a separate ticket?

I was thinking of the other polylog like functions from [ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/src/tip/ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp) when I created this ticket. It seems even the symbolic evaluation code for these is commented out, so this would require quite a bit more work than I thought. I am removing the beginner keyword and changing this ticket to only mention numeric evaluation of polylogs.

Changing keywords from "beginner" to "".

At the moment Pynac calls `symbolic/pynac.pyx:py_li()` which calls `mpmath`. It is not clear to me why the outcommented pynac code would be needed, to remove the call overhead? If you replace the CLN dependency, with what MPFR?, how would this be better or faster than mpmath?

Proposed to be invalid. If you agree I would reword this ticket to fix the mentioned bugs only.

Ah okay, what was meant in this ticket's description is GiNaC's implementation of the Nielsen Generalized Polylogarithm which is not in mpmath. I have changed the description accordingly.

Better late than never. This is now #18386.
