# Issue 33031: the outputted image slightly differ with document image

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33268

This ticket may evolve into "Parkinson's Law of Triviality".
It seems strange to think of it as a bug.
Therefore, it is hard to say, but I am noticing a difference,
so I am making it a ticket.

I believe that this is a problem
that should be solved by the leadership of one or a few developers.

I tried to run some EXAMPLE in [Contour Plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/contour_plot.html)

## environment

```
macOS Monterey
Version 12.1
```



```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```


## an example in [Contour Plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/contour_plot.html)

```
sage: contour_plot(y^2 + 1 - x^3 - x, (x,-pi,pi), (y,-pi,pi),
....:              fill=False, cmap='hsv', labels=True)
```

Is this the difference you are observing?

> The 0.00, 10.00, 30.00 labels for the corresponding
> contour lines are positioned differently.

The difference might be due to evolutions of matplotlib.

You are using Sage 9.5.rc2 and comparing with the online
documentation which is still the one for Sage 9.4.

Sage 9.4 had matplotlib 3.3.4. In the Sage 9.5 development
cycle, Sage upgraded to matplotlib 3.4.3 (#31580)
and then to matplotlib 3.5 (#33040).

The online documentation should soon become the one
for Sage 9.5 and might then match your observed output
more closely.

It seems strange to think of it as a bug or a difference.

Should I cancel this ticket?

I think we could close this as invalid indeed.

Thanks for your careful observation though.

Set to positive review if you agree, adding
your name in the "reviewer" field if you want to.
