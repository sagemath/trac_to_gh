Here is the bug report (repeated on this ticket for clarity and completeness)

I installed this on my server (4.5.2) where I have apache forwarding port 80 (outside) to port 8000 (the local sage server). On logging in, I get a browser message: "Please enable cookies or delete all Sage cookies and localhost cookies in your browser and try again." In Firebug, I see I have two cookies: `cookie_test_80`, and nb_session_8000}}}. That looks wrong, doesn't it?

When I delete all of my cookies from that server, I still can't log in (same error). After the error page comes up, and I click "Continue", I see the `cookie_test_80` cookie show up in FireCookies?. 


Before the patch, I see a `cookie_test_8000` and a `nb_session_8000` cookie. So maybe the problem is that after the patch above, we have a `cookie_test_80` cookie.
