I reviewed this ticket (without looking at its dependency #19259). I added a commits, they need cross-review.

Two questions concerning `misc.split_str_by_op`: 
- Why `+= -1` instead of `-= 1`?
- What is the purpose of the `for...else` construct: there is no `break` anyway.

LGTM; consider this as a positive review modulo the dependency #19259.

#19259 is now positive, so this is positive, too.
