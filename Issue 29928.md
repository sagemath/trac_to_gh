normalize_coordinates in projective_morphism does not properly scale by the GCD of the coefficients over a p-adic field:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(Qp(3),1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([3*x^2 + 6*y^2, 9*x*y])
sage: f.normalize_coordinates(); QQ(f[0][2,0])
-3
```

We fix the gcd computation. We also stop scaling by -1 in the p-adic case.
