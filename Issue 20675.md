I'm not sure what you mean, in this case about doing it inside a virtual environment.  If you're building Sage from scratch anyways why would that be necessary, since Sage effectively has its ow virtual environment (in the form of `$SAGE_LOCAL`).

Okay, I may start to understand.

Is this better like that ?

Yes, I think this probably makes more sense.

Please do not document this environment variable! We should use `./configure` options for this (say `./configure --enable-python3` or whatever you want to call the option) instead of yet another environment variable. Documenting means officially supporting and I'd rather not do that.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
