If I have, for example,

```
    print "F(%s,0)=%s"%(a,b)
```
the result appears as

```
    F(27,Integer(0))=359
```
which seems kind of sucky (to use the technical term).  The only workaround is something like

```
    zero = 0
    print "F(%s,%s)=%s"%(a,zero,b)
```
which is similarly sucky...

I think I asked this before at some point, and I don't recall if there was an answer.  Why does the preparser modify strings?  It doesn't always, which seems to be why I can't get a small example.
 
This might be a clue.
 
I have a function in a larger (~250 line-) file that has a print statement which looks roughly like
   print "(%s, 0) -> %s"%(blah)
This gets modified in preparsing to
   print "(%s, Integer(0)) -> %s"%(blah)
 
When I take this function and type it in by hand, or put it in a file, it behaves "correctly".  I have tried loading and attaching; same (correct) result.
 
In the case of the larger file, the changed line (above) shows up in the .py file.
 
This larger file has an "attach" line in it, and the attached file gets interpolated into the first file.  But I notice an oddity: in the resulting .py file, it appears as if the parser gets out of sync.
 
Below is a snippet of some parsed code from the .py file, the function that exhibits the bad behavior; notice that the '0' in the "range" expression is not "Integer()"ed.
 
This happens throughout the ~650-line .py file: some range statements with integer arguments have "Integer()" applied; some don't.
 
Is this expeected?
 
def Foo(i):
#    zero = 0   # Blech!
    L=DefaultTR(i,i)
    print "%s -> %s"%(L,GT(L))
    for j in range(0,i+1):
        rv = GT1(L,j)
        if rv != -1:
#            print " (%s,%s|%s) -> %s"%(i,zero,j,rv)
            print " (%s, Integer(0)|%s) -> %s"%(i,j,rv)

Yup; it's repeatable.  So far, it isn't clear how to do it.  The file in which I initially saw the problem still shows the problem.

One possible connection: I 'attach' this file, and this file contains an 'attach' of a second file.

Looking at the resulting .py file, it shows the content of the second file inserted in the first file at the line where the 'attach' is.  Some distance into the .py file, things start going bad:

Until this point, the only integer constants that get wrapped (in "Integer()") are those in code.  Beginning with a specific function, several lines occur with this form:
code... # comment

and the comments have wrapped integers.  Following these lines, *no* integer constants are wrapped (for ~200 lines), until some distance into the first file, when wrapping begins again.  From this point, only constants in strings (docstrings or print strings) appear to be wrapped.  Constants in code or comments are untouched.  Weird.

I think, in preparse(), you are making invalid assumptions about quote marks.  This is a gnarly area, but I think it can be fixed.
 
The problem is that you assume that quotes appear in pairs, but I often use them by themselves (e.g, "# It's time to punt!").
 
The fix is to identify what you are working on when you encounter a character that means something:
  if in Quoted string:
     ignore everything until matching quote
     but note when quotes are "escaped", as in "\'"
 
A quoted string means "blah" or 'blah'.
 
Make sense?

To Justin:

I just decided to try to fix this, and discovered that I still don't have an actual
example file that exhibits the problem.  I tried making some examples based on what
you wrote above, but everything I tried worked fine.  Could you send me an actual

Andrey Novoseltsev 
submitted a new bug report to me that had an example that actually illustrated the problem:

```
Dear William,
 
I believe that I found a bug - SAGE parser does not ignore comments.
 
I had the following code in .sage file
 
##########################
f.readline()    #v[d][i]: sum_j Incidence(i'th dim-d-face, j-th vertex) x 2^j
...
    if lseq[i+1][n-1-j]=='1':
...
f.readline()    #f[d][i]: sum_j Incidence(i'th dim-d-face, j-th facet) x 2^j
...
    if lseq[i+1][n-1-j]=='1':
##########################
 
and the corresponding lines in .py file look like
 
##########################
f.readline()    #v[d][i]: sum_j Incidence(i'th dim-d-face, j-th vertex) x 2^j
...
    if lseq[i+1][n-1-j]=='Integer(1)':
...
f.readline()    #f[d][i]: sum_j Incidence(i'th dim-d-face, j-th facet) x 
Integer(2)**j
...
    if lseq[i+Integer(1)][n-Integer(1)-j]=='1':
##########################
 
So because of the single  '  in the comment it changed my strings and two very 
similar pieces of code worked completely different.
 
I saved the complete files in my directory on sage.math (user novoselt) as 
bug.sage and bug.py.
 
Thank you,
Andrey 
```

I then fixed it in minutes.
