Are you running a 64-bit machine?

I looked at the code, and the problem seems to come from the fact that
it is doing a naive check on the type of the numpy array; it is
currently assuming that your float32 array is a float64 array which is
why you are getting the strange results you are.  See below:

```
sage: a = numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],float)
sage: a.dtype
dtype('float64')
sage: matrix(a)

[1.0 2.0 3.0]
[4.0 5.0 6.0]
[7.0 8.0 9.0]
sage: a = numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],'float64')
sage: a.dtype
dtype('float64')
sage: matrix(a)

[1.0 2.0 3.0]
[4.0 5.0 6.0]
[7.0 8.0 9.0]
sage: a = numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],'float32')
sage: a.dtype
dtype('float32')
sage: matrix(a)

[     2.00000047311      512.000122547       8192.0019722]
[     131072.031677 2.34082748762e-310                0.0]
