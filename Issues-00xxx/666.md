Currently, printing of matrices in Latex form is difficult to read. I'm submitting a (trivial) patch
that adds more spacing to increase readibility.

Example: 

```
sage: M=MatrixSpace(QQ,2,2)
sage: A=M([[2,3],[4,5]])
sage: latex(A)
```
currently gives:

```
\left(\begin{array}{rr}
2&3\\
4&5
\end{array}\right)
```
My patch changes this to 

```
\left(\begin{array}{rr}
2 & 3 \\
4 & 5
\end{array}\right)
```





Component: **linear algebra**
