The banner is not the output of version().   The banner is the output
of <SAGE_ROOT>/local/bin/sage-banner, which gets updated when you
upgrade sage_scripts.    In contrast, the version() function outputs
the version number of the SAGE library, i.e., what is in version.py,
which you just upgraded (correctly).    I should make the output
of version() much different.

Ok, I would prefer then that version returns a dictionary with major, minor and tiny version numbers. That would make it quite easy to write a set of functions that could check for a minimum version at startup for example.

Thoughts?

In fact: banner_text() which is used for sage-banner uses version to construct the string printed at Sage startup:

```
 s += "\n| %-66s |\n"%version() 
```

I am very tempted to make this ticket invalid unless someone can actually come up with a concrete suggestion what to do and why to do it.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment:10):
> I'm not sure I understand.  SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-banner seems to be responsible for the startup message.  Is this file autogenerated from banner_text() somehow?  

Yes, in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sdist

> If I change banner_text(), the startup message is not affected.

It is only changed once $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sdist is run.

+1 from me, but that wasn't in doubt :)
