Let k = GF(2**n). Often elements in k are represented using hexstrings in literature (e.g. cryptography). Thus, allowing finite field elements to be printed as hex strings is sometimes convenient. A decision whether this should happen in big endian or little endian ordering would be required also. SAGE prefers little endian while most literature seems to prefer big endian ordering in that case.
