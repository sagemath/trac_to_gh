This is still an issue with Sage 2.8.2. Maybe it is something for the next bug day:

This fixes the bug above. The problem was this: if M is the full space of modular symbols above, SS its cuspidal subspace, and S as above, then S is the 3rd component in the decomposition of M, but the second in the decomposition of SS. At some point, this led to an indexing problem, and the wrong rows of M.decomposition_matrix() were being used to create S.projection.

I fixed this as follows: since M has already been decomposed to get S, I simply use (M.decomposition()).index(S) to find out what the appropriate index is. I could be convinced that there's a more elegant way to do this.

I'm attaching the patch, but it's also available here:
