This bug is in firefox, not SAGE.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106048

Any reasonable workaround in my code would break future versions.  It would also require a rather massive rewrite of otherwise good (IMO) code.

In the meantime, mac users can pull the patch at my darcs repository entitled "firefox mac workaround: ctrl+enter -> alt+enter".
