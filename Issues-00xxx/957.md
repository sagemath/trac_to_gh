From Josh:

```
Thats odd, I have a sage-2.8.2 on OSX where all the commands in
numerical/test.py work fine.

Did something change in the scipy package to make it use umfpack for
sparse stuff. By default it uses superlu, but it can use umfpack.

Only think I can think of at the moment, did the order of scipy and cvxopt
change, cvxopt builds umfpack, but scipy was building before cvxopt so
wasn't using cvxopt's umfpack.
```

On a fresh install based on 2.8.13.rc1, I cannot duplicate this bug. Since I never could, could someone else using OSX verify that 

from scipy import linsolve 
from scipy import sparse 

do not raise exceptions so we can close this bug.
