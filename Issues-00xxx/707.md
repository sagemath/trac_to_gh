To be able to see the tree, here is the code from codegolf, slightly adapted to sage:

```
def chain(tree, x):
    c = [x]
    while x != 1:
        x = tree[x]
        c.append(x)
    return c[::-1]

def knuth_tree(levels):
    """
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: knuth_tree(5).show(layout='tree',tree_root=1)
        sage: G = knuth_tree(6)
        sage: Poset(G).show(layout='tree')
    """
    tree = {1: None}
    leaves = [1]
    for _ in range(levels):
        newleaves = []
        for m in leaves:
            for i in chain(tree, m):
                if i + m not in tree:
                    tree[i + m] = m
                    newleaves.append(i + m)
        leaves = newleaves
    return DiGraph([[i, tree[i]] for i in tree if not i == 1])
```
