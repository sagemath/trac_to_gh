Hello,

I just revisited this and now the speed difference (on a different system) with Sage 2.8.1:

sage: two=int(2)
sage: A = range(10^5)
sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08
sage:
sage:
sage: two=2
sage: A = srange(10^5)
sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.16 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.18 s
Wall time: 0.18

I don't have Magma installed on that machine, so no comparable numbers from there.

Thoughts?

Michael

on 2.10.2 on my system, comparing the original ticket:

```
sage: sage: two=int(2)
sage: sage: A = range(10^5)
sage: sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.04 s
Wall time: 0.04
sage: sage: two=2
sage: sage: A = srange(10^5)
sage: sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.07 s
Wall time: 0.07
```


and comparing the comments (with 10^6, not 10^5)

```
sage: sage: A = range(10^6)
sage: sage: two = int(2)
sage: sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.33
sage: two=2
sage: sage: sage: A = srange(10^6)
sage: sage: sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.54 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.60 s
Wall time: 0.60
```

So the issue seems to be not to show up like the original post, but I'm still seeing speed decreases as pointed out in the comments.

TODAY we have with Magma2.14 and Sage on OS X 10 32-bit core2duo.

```
two := 2;                      
A := [0..10^5-1];             
time B := [i + two : i in A]; 
```

```
sage: two=2
sage: A = srange(10^5)
sage: time B = [i+two for i in A]
CPU times: user 0.05 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.06 s
```



The *right* benchmark:

```
two := 2;                      
A := [0..10^5-1];  
time for i in A do b := i + two; end for;
Time: 0.020
```

In Sage:

```
%cython
from sage.all import srange, Integer
from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer

cdef object two=Integer(2)
cdef list A = srange(Integer(100000))

def foo4():
   for i in A:
      (<Integer>two)._add_c(<Integer>i)
```

This takes 0.17s, beating magma.

And in pure python

```
two=2
A = srange(100000)
def bar():
    for i in A:
        c = i + two

timeit('bar()')
///
25 loops, best of 3: 24.6 ms per loop
```
