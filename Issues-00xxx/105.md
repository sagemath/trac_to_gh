It would be very useful to have a feature in the notebook, where you
could get the entire thing as one big html tarball.  E.g., I have a bunch
of worksheets in a notebook I made with Barry Mazur, and I want to
make them very easy for him to browse "offline" without SAGE.  I
have to go through each individually and save the .html.   We should
think of a nice design for this...

sagenb currently allows you to download a zip file containing .sws files for all your worksheets. Is this sufficient?

The "browse offline" is different than a zip of .sws files.  I think this is "published as html files", then "zip all those together".  We don't even have an easy way to publish to html yet.

Wow, here is a lure of closing a 3-digit ticket....

In fact, the fourth-lowest remaining, I think.
