NumberFields support a matrix() class, very handy.  FiniteFields and FiniteField extensions should also support such a beast.  In fact, all algebraic extensions should provide such functionality, but at this time there is no generic AlgebraicExtension class in which to put such functionality.  Damn you, Pyrex and multiple inheritance!

This ticket means that the method matrix() which is described as: "The matrix of right multiplication by the element on the power basis $1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{d-1}$ for the number field.  Thus the {\em rows} of this matrix give the images of each of the $x^i$." should be added to finite extension fields. Also, (my addition) the method vector() of GFq should proably be added to number field elements.
