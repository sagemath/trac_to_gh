NumberFields support a matrix() class, very handy.  FiniteFields and FiniteField extensions should also support such a beast.  In fact, all algebraic extensions should provide such functionality, but at this time there is no generic AlgebraicExtension class in which to put such functionality.  Damn you, Pyrex and multiple inheritance!

I don't understand what you're talking about, what you want, or why this is a defect and not

This ticket means that the method matrix() which is described as: "The matrix of right multiplication by the element on the power basis $1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{d-1}$ for the number field.  Thus the {\em rows} of this matrix give the images of each of the $x^i$." should be added to finite extension fields. Also, (my addition) the method vector() of GFq should proably be added to number field elements.
