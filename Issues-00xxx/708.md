This is still the case:

Is anyone working in that area?

**Attachment:** [708-speedup_poly_irred.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket708/708-speedup_poly_irred.patch)

There is a simple way of getting within range of Magma's speed: by Gauss' lemma, we can clear the denominators to get a polynomial over the integers, then test it for irreducibility using the significantly faster code over ZZ.

See the attached patch.  I'm getting a speedup factor of about 10, but I can't compare to Magma since I don't have it.

Speed report:

```
sage: R = QQ['x']
sage: f = R.random_element(1000)
sage: time f.is_irreducible()
CPU times: user 2.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.06 s
Wall time: 2.06 s
True
sage: g = magma(f)
sage: t = magma.cputime()
sage: sage: time g.IsIrreducible()

Wall time: 5.24 s

The new code seems to compare favorably to Magma. IIRC Bill Hart suggested to do pretty much everything with Flint w.r.t. to QQ[x]. Maybe that could be another ticket/task.
