Attachment: **[708-speedup_poly_irred.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket708/708-speedup_poly_irred.patch.gz)**

There is a simple way of getting within range of Magma's speed: by Gauss' lemma, we can clear the denominators to get a polynomial over the integers, then test it for irreducibility using the significantly faster code over ZZ.

See the attached patch.  I'm getting a speedup factor of about 10, but I can't compare to Magma since I don't have it.
