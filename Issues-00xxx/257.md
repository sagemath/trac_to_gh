Following a null pointer gives the user an oh-so-friendly message.  Then (s)he has to use the mouse to restart the notebook manually.

Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with `_sig_`on, `_sig_`off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
