It would be nice if, when one line of a doctest fails, then the doctest doesn't run the rest of that "example block". What tends to happen is e.g. one line fails, so then a bunch of variables aren't defined, and then you get tons of garbage in your doctest output, which is hard to sift through. After the first failure, it would be good if it would just stop there, and move onto the next example. (Or at least if there was an option for this behaviour.)

Doctest is a completely standard Python module.  I didn't write it.  Maybe you
should look at the documentation and see if it has the feature you want already.
If not, you could propose it to the Python people (e.g., as a PEP).  This 
isn't really a SAGE question.

The new doctest option `sage -t --initial` sort of does this: it shows only the first failure in a doctest block. It's an *option* which needs to be specified explicitly but I think that's sufficient.
