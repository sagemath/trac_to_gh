Doctest is a completely standard Python module.  I didn't write it.  Maybe you
should look at the documentation and see if it has the feature you want already.
If not, you could propose it to the Python people (e.g., as a PEP).  This 
isn't really a SAGE question.

The new doctest option `sage -t --initial` sort of does this: it shows only the first failure in a doctest block. It's an *option* which needs to be specified explicitly but I think that's sufficient.
