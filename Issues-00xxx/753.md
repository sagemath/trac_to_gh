arrggh this is a bit of a mess currently. All the types seem to behave differently at the moment. Some standardisation is really needed here, and things pulled back closer to the base classes. Examples:

```
sage: x = var("x")
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicVariable'>
sage: x.diff()
1
sage: x.derivative()
1
sage: x.differentiate()
1

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: x.derivative()
1
sage: x.diff()
[boom]

sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: x.diff()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/dmharvey/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: diff() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
sage: x.derivative()
1

Attached patch revamps all derivative functions in sage, and also covers #756 and #1578.

This has been tested (sort of) on 2.10.2.

I'm now going to try against mabshoff's pseudo-2.10.3.rc0.

I'm not sure whether this should be targeted at 2.10.3 or 2.10.4.

Looks good to me!  "sage -testall" passes, code and doctests look good.  I added a patch that changes some indirect doctests to direct doctests, and fixes a 1-character typo.

Apply all three patches.
