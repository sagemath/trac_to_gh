This ticket implements

* an optional Sage package for CryptoMiniSat
* a C++ interface to CryptoMiniSat which supports xor clauses, options, conflict clauses and learnt clause extraction
* a generic interface for various SAT solvers based on the DIMACS file format
* instantiations of this interface for Glucose and RSat
* a converter for Boolean Polynomials to SAT
* highlevel functions for solving Boolean polynomial systems and for learning new polynomials for Boolean polynomial systems

How to install/test:

1. **Install** http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/cryptominisat-2.9.5.spkg
2. **Pull** from https://bitbucket.org/malb/sage-cryptominisat

**Note to release manager:** The SPKG is optional but the patches for the Sage library should be merged.

Actually there are many SAT solvers out of there

http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/solvers.html

and many of them understand a commond format, the conjuntive normal form in the DIMACS format: 

http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps

An important first step, would be creating a method for the symbolic logic class that supports output of a formula in the DIMACS format

Btw. there are two independent open-source ANF2CNF converters available now:

   * http://bitbucket.org/malb/algebraic_attacks/src/tip/anf2cnf.py
   * http://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori-scripts/src/tip/cnf.py

The later will be available in PolyBoRi soon, I am not sure whether the former is completely redundant because of the later. More benchmarks are needed to figure this out I guess.

malb considers them more or less dupes (at least #5671), especially since he added DIMACS to this ticket.  I am not knowledgeable enough to say whether that is legitimate, but had just wanted to point it out.
