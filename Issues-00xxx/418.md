This ticket implements

* an optional Sage package for CryptoMiniSat
* a C++ interface to CryptoMiniSat which supports xor clauses, options, conflict clauses and learnt clause extraction
* a generic interface for various SAT solvers based on the DIMACS file format
* instantiations of this interface for Glucose and RSat
* a converter for Boolean Polynomials to SAT
* highlevel functions for solving Boolean polynomial systems and for learning new polynomials for Boolean polynomial systems

How to install/test:

1. **Install**Â http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/cryptominisat-2.9.5.spkg
2. **Pull** from https://bitbucket.org/malb/sage-cryptominisat

**Note to release manager:** The SPKG is optional but the patches for the Sage library should be merged.

Depends on #13315

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**CC:**  PolyBoRi fichtejo abmasse sbulygin

**Keywords:** SAT

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Reviewer:** Alexander Dreyer

**Author:** Martin Albrecht

**Merged:** sage-5.3.beta1

Actually there are many SAT solvers out of there

http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/solvers.html

and many of them understand a commond format, the conjuntive normal form in the DIMACS format: 

http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps

An important first step, would be creating a method for the symbolic logic class that supports output of a formula in the DIMACS format

Btw. there are two independent open-source ANF2CNF converters available now:

   * http://bitbucket.org/malb/algebraic_attacks/src/tip/anf2cnf.py
   * http://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori-scripts/src/tip/cnf.py

The later will be available in PolyBoRi soon, I am not sure whether the former is completely redundant because of the later. More benchmarks are needed to figure this out I guess.

malb considers them more or less dupes (at least #5671), especially since he added DIMACS to this ticket.  I am not knowledgeable enough to say whether that is legitimate, but had just wanted to point it out.

It seems that interfaces had changes, so the spkg doesn't fit with the sage library patches.
It seems that your installation picked up the headers from the old install. Maybe its enough to delete `SAGE_INC+"/cryptominisat/`?

I fixed a few trivial things below, but there's more to be done:
