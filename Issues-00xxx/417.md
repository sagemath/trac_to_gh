The Pari+Python interface is too slow. ntl.ZZ_pE+Cython should be much faster.

I completely agree.  How much work has been done on this yet and how much work still needs to be done?

I don't think anybody worked on this much. GF(2<sup>e</sup>) was switched to NTL, but nothing else happened. 

However, the GF(2<sup>e</sup>) should be a reasonable starting point for doing other fields (word-sized primes and general primes). 

Also, we should eventually move sparse moduli interally but that's for another project :)
