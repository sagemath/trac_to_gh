IIRC this gcc option is added by `python-cflags`:

```
SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python2.5-config --cflags
-I/home/malb/SAGE/local/include/python2.5 \ 
-I/home/malb/SAGE/local/include/python2.5 \
-fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall \
-Wstrict-prototypes
```

I agree with malb here that it is Python which is at fault here. Since this is only a minor annoyance I think we should just invalidate it.
