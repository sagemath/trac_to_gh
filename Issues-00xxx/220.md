<a id='comment:1'></a>Steps to get this done:
1. Read through the current python code and add doctests for every single function.
2. Move the abstract base class into a SageX file.
3. Get to compile.
4. Make the changes needed so it works correctly, e.g., Py_ssize_t's, etc. 
 
Later on -- make some specialized classes...
