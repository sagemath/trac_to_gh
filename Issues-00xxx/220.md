<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Steps to get this done:
1. Read through the current python code and add doctests for every single function.
2. Move the abstract base class into a SageX file.
3. Get to compile.
4. Make the changes needed so it works correctly, e.g., Py_ssize_t's, etc. 
 
Later on -- make some specialized classes...

I think this has already been done as evidenced by sage/rings/power_series*.pyx.  This was done around Sage 2.4.2 -- changeset 4159.
