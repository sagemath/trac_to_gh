Hello,

have a look at http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage/packages/optional/ - many of those packages have become default packages or are hopelessly out of date. LinBox-1.0.0 anybody?

That page needs a cleanup. Maybe its generation can be automated by scanning the right directory and creating a static html page via daily cronjob.

Cheers,

Michael
