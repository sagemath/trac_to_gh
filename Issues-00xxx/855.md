It would be very helpful if "sage -optional" and "sage -experimental" listed one- or two-sentence descriptions of each package.  (Several of the packages I had to look up using Google.  Also, it was only by accident that I discovered that "axiom4sage" was the complete axiom distribution, rather than just an axiom interface.)

Here are descriptions of the current optional packages, except that I don't actually know what "database_symbolic_data" is.  I was able to do a number of them in a single line; is that helpful?  Also, how do we actually incorporate these?  (Should each description be added, somehow, to the SPKG.txt file for each package?)

This should be done by automatically extracting the first line from the Description section of the SPKG.txt, if it is there. Use a line like this:

```
sage@sagemath:~/www-files/packages/optional$ tar xvf biopython-1.53.p0.spkg biopython-1.53.p0/SPKG.txt
```
or better yet, write a Python script using the tarfile module. 

I'm currently working on this, and hope to close this ticket soon :-)

OK, I made it so gen_html automatically extracts the SPKG.txt files.   The HTML isn't pretty, but making it so should be another ticket.
