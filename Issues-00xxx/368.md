Try this

```
var('x a b')
show(solve(x^3 + c*x + b ==0, x)[0])
```

Then eval, click edit and save.
It doesn't work since the output of show
has }}} in it -- it's part of valid latex.

What are we to do?

Component: **notebook**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Fixed by requiring }}} to have a newline before it.  That's hackish, but better than
nothing.
