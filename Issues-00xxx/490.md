Hello,

not to be surprised by a new gcc version I have started building gcc 4.3 snapshots (20070824 in this particular case) and compile Sage with them. Here is a problem with gmp.h

Givaro's gmp test fails:

```
g++ -I ../../../../local/include/ -L ../../../../local/lib/ -l gmp  gcc-test.cpp -o gcc-test
In file included from gcc-test.cpp:1:
../../../../local/include/gmp.h:515: error: ‘std::FILE’ has not been declared
```
Uncommenting "std::FILE" fixes the problem.

```
#if defined (__cplusplus)
extern "C" {
//using std::FILE;
#endif
```
