You can build libCF with and without IO support and apparently this got mixed
up. This is why we build a stand-alone libCF/libfac after we built SINGULAR
and libSINGULAR. This way we make sure OSTREAM is known properly. Short
answer: I'll have look at it.

Unfortunately, that new package breaks compilation on OSX and/or Linux. William has revered back to some former version of the spkg, so let's reopen this and target it at 2.8.3 and hope that it will be all sorted out be by then.
