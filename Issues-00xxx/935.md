[21:20] <wstein> #935 -- reject.
[21:20] <mabshoff> Why?
[21:20] <wstein> Those files *should* be in sage.
[21:20] <mabshoff> So why aren't they in the repo?
[21:20] <wstein> probably they didn't get included because of a mistake in MANIFEST.in.
[21:20] <mabshoff> ok
[21:21] <mabshoff> So mark #935 as invalid?
[21:21] <wstein> at least the one that doctests cvxopt, scipy, definitely should be remade.
[21:21] <mabshoff> That is another ticket.
[21:21] <wstein> It's not invalid, it's just that the fix isn't exactly right.
