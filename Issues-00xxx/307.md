Currently vector/vector multiplication returns a vector, when it should just return a scalar:

```
sage: b = vector([0,1,2]); u= vector([1,3,5]);
sage: u*b
(0, 3, 10)
```

In this particular case, the answer should just be 13

No it shouldn't.  If you want the dot product, you should do this:

```
sage:  b = vector([0,1,2]); u= vector([1,3,5]);
sage: b.dot_product(u)
13
```
