Hermite Normal form is the analogue of echelon form over the integers.
It's crucial for almost all efficient computations with Z-modules (infinite 
abelian groups, finite abelian groups, lattices, modular abelian varieties
via lattices, etc).  

MAGMA is 50 times faster even for small examples, and asymptotically
much faster than GAP, PARI, and NTL.

**Attachment:** [trac-174-part3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket174/trac-174-part3.patch)

I've put the final hnf.hg bundle here:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/hnf.hg

This is a bundle that I made by cleanly applying all my relevant
patches to 2.10.2.alpha0, then do hg_sage.send(...). 

The code is well documented, works well (very well tested with
automated testing and doctstrings), but has a HUGE MEMORY LEAK somewhere:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,200,x=0,y=9)
sage: a._clear_cache(); e = a.hermite_form(proof=False); get_memory_usage()
'234M+'
sage: a._clear_cache(); e = a.hermite_form(proof=False); get_memory_usage()
'239M+'
sage: a._clear_cache(); e = a.hermite_form(proof=False); get_memory_usage()
'244M+'
sage: a._clear_cache(); e = a.hermite_form(proof=False); get_memory_usage()
'249M+'
```

I suspect the memleak is in the optimized GMP code I added to matrix_integer_dense, and will find out soon...
