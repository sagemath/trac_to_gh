The following integral should be divergent, but sage (and maxima?) gives an answer.

```
sage: integrate(1/x^3,x,-1,3)
4/9
sage: version()
'SAGE Version 2.8.7, Release Date: 2007-10-15'

That's supposed to say:

This is due to Maxima:

```
(%i3) integrate(1/x^3,x,-1,3);
Principal Value                                       4
(%o3)                                  -
                                       9

```

I'm not quite sure what to do about it at the moment.

I've attached a patch which makes "Principal Value" output in Maxima raise an error so that sage does not return the wrong answer.  Here is the behavior after the patch.

```
sage: integrate(1/x^3,x,-1,3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>            Traceback (most recent call last)

/opt/sage/devel/sage-calc/sage/calculus/<ipython console> in <module>()

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/calculus/functional.py in integral(f, *args, **kwds)
    175         return f.integral(*args, **kwds)
    176     except ValueError, err:
--> 177         raise err
    178     except AttributeError:
    179         pass

<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>: Integral is divergent.
```

This patch should be applied after the patch for #921 is applied.
