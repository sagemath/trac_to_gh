Currently, if you make an integer matrix:

```
A=Matrix(Integers(),3,3,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
```
there seems no direct way to get an LLL reduced basis of its row or column space (whichever is appropriate for SAGE).
There is `ntl.mat_ZZ.LLL`, which may or may not be good. pari also has LLL implementations.

It's really worth it to have a good integer LLL easily accessible in SAGE.
