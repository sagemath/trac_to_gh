This violates the principle of least surprise, at least for me:

```
sage: x = -2.0
sage: x.abs()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/david/sage-2.8.5/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber' object has no attribute 'abs'
```
