If you have a ./foo.spyx Cython file, and you "load foo.spyx" in SAGE, then touch foo.spyx and again "load foo.spyx", it gives messages of the sort:

ln: create symbolic link './d' to '/home/sage/d': File exists

for every directory d in ./

Everything appears to compile correctly, but if you're working in a directory with 100 folders, this can be very annoying!
