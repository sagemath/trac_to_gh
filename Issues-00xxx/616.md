sage -coverage is currently easy to trick: just add a doctest that doesn't actually test your function. This can also happen by accident: if you copy-paste a function, and then don't look at the docstring, you end up with a function that has fake doctests. (This occurs in various places in the sage source code.) 

This patch makes sage -coverage a little smarter: it looks every time to make sure that the function name occurs in the doctests, and if not, adds the function to a list of "possibly wrong" functions that it spits out at the end. If the function begins and ends with __, we don't bother looking for the name in the docstring. Also, if the string 'indirect doctest' occurs anywhere, we don't look. 

This patch also sneaks in a change so that scons is replaced by scons -Q, making it quieter whenever it's called. Time for the first line-item veto in a sage patch? :)
