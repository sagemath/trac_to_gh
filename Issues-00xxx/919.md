Upon creation, p-adic rings currently cache powers of p from 0 up to their precision cap.  This uses O(n**2) space, and is very unfriendly to someone who wants to use a capped relative ring with very high precision in order to never run into the precision cap.

Keywords: **padics**

Component: **basic arithmetic**
