The attached patch implements a **MPolynomialSystem**, a **MPolynomialSystemGenerator** class, and as a generator for small scale AES variants.


**MPolynomialSystem** is supposed to model multivariate polynomial systems as they appear in e.g. algebraic cryptanalysis. The implemented design is as follows: There is a class **MPolynomialSystem** which models the actual polynomial system. This class contains a list of **MPolynomialRoundSystems** to model the rounds of a cipher to add some structure. **MPolynomialSystem** is furthermore specialised to **MPolynomialSystem_gf2[e]** classes which have additional features. E.g. systems over `GF(2^e)` can be projected down to `GF(2)` and systems over `GF(2)` may eventually contain rountines for ANF-CNF conversion.

Also there is a class called **MPolynomialSystemGenerator** which is meant as a base class for specific generators for polynomial systems like AES or the Courtois Toy Cipher (CTC).

The patch also contains a generator for polynomial systems for small scale AES variants (SR) over `GF(2)` and `GF(2^e)` as introduced in http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sean/smallAES-fse05.pdf .
