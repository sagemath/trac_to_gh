I can't remember why I had bothered to define TMPDIR in the first
place, but there must have been some other build at some other time
that needed it to be defined.

Thanks for all of your help.  I suppose that adding a check to make

I can put "unset TMPDIR" in the spkg-install file for singular.  I'm
really glad you tracked this down precisely!
