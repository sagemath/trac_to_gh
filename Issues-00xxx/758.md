It can be vastly faster. There are several layers now...stripping them out one by one. 

```
sage: f = Integers(101)['x'](range(10))
sage: time for _ in range(10^5): g = f*f
CPU time: 2.97 s,  Wall time: 3.00 s

sage: f = Integers(100)['x'](range(10))
sage: time for _ in range(10^5): g = f*f
CPU time: 0.17 s,  Wall time: 0.18 s
```

(This is not quite fair because one is using ZZ_p and one is using zz_p, but there is only a factor of <2 between those in NTL.)

The latest bundle includes improvements to Laurent series, Monsky-Waschnitzer computations MUCH faster now (just waiting on fast p-adic linear algebra).

It seems that this still could be applicable, even though it is somewhat faster (NTL rewrite, coercion?)
