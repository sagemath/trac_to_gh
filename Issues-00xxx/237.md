It would be nice to have some sort of inverse expression finder that takes a real number and returns possible identities it might be, like the identify Maple command or the Inverse Symbolic Calculator of yore.  This could be via a web interface or by having an spkg (perhaps optional) for such functionality.

By \"bindings\" I don't mean actual bindings - this kind of program isn't going to be called en masse or require a whole lot of speed in the communication pipeline like, say GAP does, so writing a `libries` (to actually link against the RIES code) is surely unnecessary.\n\nWe can just write an interface in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/` which takes a Sage number of some kind, converts it into a string, and then calls `ries` on the command line with it. The only nontrivial part would be to convert the result back into a form that is meaningful in Sage, (as opposed to just printing it as it appears when calling `ries` on the command line). For example you might want to convert the output of `ries` into a list of Sage symbolic expressions, or something like that. That would involve string parsing to decipher the output notation `ries` uses.\n\nI could probably give it a try if I get some time. Of course, other developers are free to do so as well :)",

I don't think it would be such a big deal. By "bindings" I don't mean actual bindings - this kind of program isn't going to be called en masse or require a whole lot of speed in the communication pipeline like, say GAP does, so writing a `libries` (to actually link against the RIES code) is surely unnecessary.

We can just write an interface in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/` which takes a Sage number of some kind, converts it into a string, and then calls `ries` on the command line with it. The only nontrivial part would be to convert the result back into a form that is meaningful in Sage, (as opposed to just printing it as it appears when calling `ries` on the command line). For example you might want to convert the output of `ries` into a list of Sage symbolic expressions, or something like that. That would involve string parsing to decipher the output notation `ries` uses.

I could probably give it a try if I get some time. Of course, other developers are free to do so as well :)

Soooooo is anybody still working on interfacing Sage wth ISC (http://isc.carma.newcastle.edu.au/standard) at the moment ? And does it make sense to you ? If so I'm willing to give it a try `:-)`

Ok, then let's work hard so that you could have used it last week `:-P`

Well, I wrote a few lines of code and it "works", but there are some problems for which I would like everybody's advice.

```
sage: ask_ISC(3.14)                         
Asking ISC what it knows about 3.14000000000000
No result found in ISC
```

That's the first problem : 3.14, for Sage, is equal to 3.1400000000. Which, for ISC, is totally different.

There's a way out if we only feed the function with a string instead, but it's not a good way out for it should ultimately be a method of Sage constants...

Second problem, which is just technical : where should this method appear ? Where in the code ? Or should it appear nowhere, and just be available as a function in a module ?

Then, the output.

```
sage: ask_ISC("3.14")
Asking ISC what it knows about 3.14
3140000117869847 sin(Pi*4/35)*sin(Pi*19/54)
3140000181376111 Lehmer^sr(Pi)/2^(1/3)
3140000375403483 sum(1/(5^n+(31/2*n^2-27/2*n+51)),n=1..inf)
3140000446459760 (K(1/sr(2))+GAM(5/24))^Golomb
3140000895104510 GAM(2/3)-Li4(1/2)^ln(Pi)
3140001879986726 (exp(1/Pi)+5)/(-arctan(1/2)+2/3)
...
```

I don't think that it would make sense to return a Python object for I have no idea what one could want to do with it automatically. Most of the symbolic formulas have no meaning in Sage, so it's really just for the user to see. Right now the method returns nothing and just prints the result. The only think that may be cool to add would be a nice way to display such results in the notebook, but I would like to hear your advice on the possible outputs too `:-)`

And you can try this small patch if you want in the meantime.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!!

The function `algdep` can help identify algebraic numbers.

It would be nice to be able to identify transcendental
expressions as well.
