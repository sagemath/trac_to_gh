<a id='comment:1'></a>On a fresh copy of 2.8.8.1, I removed the nodoctest at the top, searched for sage.:'s, found none, and tried testing:

```
sha:~/sage-2.8.8.1 robert$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_database.py 
sage -t  devel/sage-db/sage/graphs/graph_database.py

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 62.1 seconds

That's pretty mysterious!

which is unfortunate, because now not a single value is returned by the query (they are all "?"). Is a completely broken doctest that passes better? I'd like to know why those changes were made, and what they were supposed to get around...

If we change things back to before this change, then we can get the failures William was talking about, which seems a lot closer to the problem...

I'm moving this back to 2.9.

else:
    # Deal only with the string:

The problem is in the else block, where query is something. The problem is, this else block is confused about what that is.
