Building SAGE with Cygwin is absolutely definitely not supported,
and will not work.  The only way to run SAGE on Windows, is via
VMware (or Virtual PC or some other virtualization). 

I'll make a ticket for making it so that the SAGE build scrip very very
clearly indicates that it won't work on Cygwin right at the beginning,
to avoid such confusion in the future. 

NOTE: SAGE used to support Cygwin several months ago (around March
2007), so you may have seen some old documentation about this.
```

This will be easy to fix by modifying spkg/base/prereq-0* to check for the Cygwin UNAME.

I fixed this by changing prereq-0.3-install, and actually did a bunch of other
minor cleanup to the base directory, including creating an .hg repo there.
