Trac comes with its own Wiki and if something like LinBox is found in a user submitted test, it is enhanced with a link to that wiki instance. As we don't use this wiki but have our own at http://wiki.sagemath.org we should change that behavior such that the link points to our wiki instead.

I am not sure this is a desired or even achievable feature.
