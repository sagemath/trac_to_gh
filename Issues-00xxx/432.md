<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

Tried the patch on 2.10.3 and still had some problems with it - worked sometimes but not others.
Installed 2.10.4.final which includes the patch and it now works fine. Could this be some
interaction with other patches?
Anyway - seems fine under 2.10.4 now.
