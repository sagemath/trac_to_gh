line 35 in sage-location tries to split off SAGE-ROOT by looking for the first occurrence of
"local/" in the string. This fails if, for instance, sage is installed in
"/usr/local/sage/latestversion/..."

A fix that seems to work at present if to search for the last occurrence of "local/" instead:

```
           i = z.rfind('local/')
```

One would have to check that no further "local/" can occur inside
$SAGE_ROOT/local/
in order for this criterion to work.
