The attached patches implement inplace operators for `IntegerMod`, `FiniteFieldElement_givaro` and `MPolynomial_libsingular`.

Some timings for GF(q)

Before:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^15)
sage: A = [a^i for i in range(k.order())]
sage: %timeit _ = sum(A)
100 loops, best of 3: 6.79 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(2^15)
sage: A = [a^i for i in range(k.order())]
sage: %timeit _ = sum(A)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**
