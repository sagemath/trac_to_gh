sage: pAdicField(5, 3)(-1)
 4 + 4*5 + 4*5^2 + O(5^Infinity)

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I've fixed this (patch to be submitted soon), but the problem is deeper, it's not just to do with coercion, e.g.

```
sage: K = pAdicField(5, 3)
sage: K(2) - K(3)
 4 + 4*5 + 4*5^2 + O(5^Infinity)
```
