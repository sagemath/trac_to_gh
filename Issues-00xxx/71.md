When a .sage file is "load"ed or "attach"ed, it gets translated to a .py file before being processed; the result is a file with different structure than the original.  Any errors are described in terms of the .py file, not the .sage file.

One working solution is to monkey-patch `traceback.extract_tb()` to undo preparsing.

The traceback below was generated with this patch. It shows the unpreparsed `1/0` and it also shows the Cython source (see #17382):

```

SAGE can embed the original line numbers in the .py file, and even the original
.sage lines (before parsing) in the .sage file.  Then the error messages will
also list the original line number (and line, if you want) in a comment at the end
of the line.   In the notebook, at least, it would be easy to postparse the error
messages so they refer to the original .sage file.
