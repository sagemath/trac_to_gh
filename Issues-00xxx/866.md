Hello,

I ran Ifti's code with 3 iterations (see ticket #501) and there is a problem in __repr__:

```
==6721== 1,337,726 bytes in 97,087 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 2,181 of 2,187

Hello,

`__repr__` in ntl_ZZ_pX.pyx leaks. With the following (ugly) patch this problem is solved:

```
==7976== LEAK SUMMARY:
==7976==    definitely lost: 616 bytes in 50 blocks.
==7976==      possibly lost: 325,454 bytes in 776 blocks.
==7976==    still reachable: 36,843,962 bytes in 19,920 blocks.
==7976==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
It was only one round instead of three, but the problem is gone.

Cheers,

Michael
