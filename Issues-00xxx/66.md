That's actually a pretty good idea for a temporary workaround.  Thanks!
Could you please resend the sed file as an attachment or post it somewhere

Yes, this could be easily automated (by those who know how)
from within Sage by modifying some code that's part of the 
notebook server.

A C program to do conversion from HTML to LaTeX is available:

It's available under the GPL. Also on that web page is a link to a Perl program that is supposed to be better. I'm not certain about the license of the Perl program.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

In principle, this is possible using one of TWO methods.
* [sws2tex](https://bitbucket.org/whuss/sws2tex), which should probably just be merged into sage or sagenb eventually, plus latex
* `sage -sws2rst` along with `sphinx-quickstart`, `sphinx-build`, and finally `make pdf`
One would have to automate these things and throw very good error messages in the event latex was not available, as it is only a recommended Sage dependency.   `sws2rst` has the advantage of keeping (2d) graphics, `sws2tex` the advantage of fewer steps.

Also, of course, it is possible to get a non-latex pdf and has been for a long, long time, but just by "print"ing the page, though this is surprisingly useful in informal contexts.
