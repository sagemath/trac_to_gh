Yes, by appropriately rewriting some of the css that defines the page
in sage/notebook/server/css.py.
I wish somebody would do that and send me a patch.

Note that if you just shrink the space on your machine, it will actually
completely cover up all the controls on the top on many other machines.
It's very very system dependent.  Having extra space is the only reasonable
solution until somebody sits down and does this right.
