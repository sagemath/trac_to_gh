    cdef matrix_window_c(self, Py_ssize_t row, Py_ssize_t col,
                        Py_ssize_t nrows, Py_ssize_t ncols):
```
I ran 

```
A = matrix(Integers(389),4,range(16)); A._echelon_strassen(4)
```
under valgrind on sage.math and nothing turned up. So I believe this comment should be removed.

Cheers,
