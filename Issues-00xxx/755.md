A line in adjacency_matrix() calls self.multiple_edges instead of self.multiple_edges(), causing adjacency_matrix() to never return a matrix over IntegerModRing(2), like it apparently was designed to return.  However, kirchhoff_matrix() relies on this bug, as it does a list(-M), where M is the adjacency matrix, which doesn't work when M is a binary matrix.  So kirchhoff_matrix() needs to be fixed (so it doesn't rely on the faulty behavior).

Component: **combinatorics**
