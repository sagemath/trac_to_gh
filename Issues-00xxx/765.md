The following isn't implemented in a useful way anyway, but the fact that crtl-C does not work properly is a bad sign:

Control-c works fine now (tested on linux and osx).  Maybe this was fixed by the other control-c related fixes that Gonzalo Tornaria and I made at SD5.

I found this ancient ticket while looking for anything mentioning kummer_surface.  With Sage 5.10 it does not work at all:
