The NTL itself does actually leak some memory. This might be one of those. I has been considered not worth fixing by Victor Shoup, but I cannot find the reference at the moment. 

So  we might need to close this or add some deallocation hooks to NTL itself. Because this leak is rather small I don't consider this a high priority for now.

Cheers,

Michael

This is still an issue with 3.0.alpha6, but the "definitely lost" turned into "still reachable".
