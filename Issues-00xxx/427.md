The infix operator '\' does not print properly in the notebook
when used in the examples of solve_right (for a matrix)
(file:
`local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx`)
I suspect that these backslashes simply end up escaping the space after them. Some more preprocessing may be needed to escape backslashes occurring in examples in documentation?
