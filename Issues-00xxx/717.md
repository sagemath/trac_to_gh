Issues:
1. I can't actually find anywhere in sage-doctest right now where the two alarm codes are actually used, so SAGE should never timeout.  Weird.
2. It should be easy for users to adjust the timeout, e.g., on slow systems.

Patch looks with one tiny exception:

```
[10:25pm] mab|ds9: one suggestions: raise the sleep period to 1 second: time.sleep(.1)
[10:25pm] gfurnish: feel free to make the modification
[10:25pm] mab|ds9: I think we can live with that.
[10:25pm] mab|ds9: mk
```
I will move item (2) to its own ticket since it is not addressed here.

Cheers,

Michael
