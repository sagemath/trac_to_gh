There is a doctest (or doctests) in 

```
    sage -t --long coding/code_constructions.py 
```
that take many *hours*.  Run the above with --verbose and fix the doctests so they run in a reasonable
amount of time.  An example that never finishes is broken. 

Basically, for starters do

```
    sage -t --verbose --long coding/code_constructions.py 
```
and see what happens.  Also, consider doing

```
    grep "sage:" coding/code_constructions.py | sage
```

The following example is in the docstring for ToricCode:

```
sage: C = ToricCode([[0,0],[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,1],[2,2],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2],[4,1]],GF(8,"a"))
sage: C
Linear code of length 49, dimension 11 over Finite Field in a of size 2^3
sage: C.minimum_distance()  ## long time -- very time consuming
28
```
I assumed that the tester would ignore commands with a "## long time -- very time consuming" comment. If not, this could definitely bog this test down. 
I'll keep investigating this though.

That was it. It replaced 

```
sage: C.minimum_distance()  ## long time -- very time consuming
```
by

```
sage.:. C.minimum_distance()  ## long time -- very time consuming
```
and then the following was the result of sage -t:

```

         [11.6 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!

```
It appears that the sage -t test is behaving differently since at one time this
"long time" comment would be passed over by sage -t. Is this new 
behavior intentional? If yes, I'll submit a patch. If not, then the file can 
stay as is.

I fixed the docstring to that sage -t --long doesn't time out.

```
