I'm not understanding your question. Lists are mutable:
sage: L = [0,0]
sage: L[:1] = [1]
sage: L
 [1, 0]
pari vectors apparently are not. Are you saying they should be?
Or is it that you don't like the error message?
 
The problem is simply that I only implemented __setitem__ in
the case of an integer input.  He wants a more general __setitem__
to be implemented also for PARI vectors, which are mutable:
sage: s=pari.vector(2,[0,0])
sage: s[0] = 5
sage: s
[5, 0]
 
I think the problem is that I didn't realize "s[slice] = blah"
was a standard Python idiom, so I didn't implement support for
it for the PARI C-library interface.

[10:22pm] mabshoff: craigcitro: One more think for #169 - looks like 32 vs. 64 bit maybe?
[10:50pm] craigcitro: mabshoff: oops, i can't count.
[10:50pm] craigcitro: i multiplied by 2 when i should have divided ...
[10:50pm] craigcitro: the 4 should really be a 1
[10:50pm] mabshoff: Don't tell me this fails on your box, too 
[10:51pm] mabshoff:
[10:51pm] craigcitro: (it's already got cases for 32 vs 64 bit)
[10:51pm] craigcitro: grin
[10:51pm] mabshoff:
[10:51pm] craigcitro: yeah, i was just being dumb.
[10:51pm] mabshoff: Don't divide - craigcitro inside?
[10:51pm] craigcitro: hahahahaha
[10:51pm] mabshoff: Couldn't resist
