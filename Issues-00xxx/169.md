I'm not understanding your question. Lists are mutable:
sage: L = [0,0]
sage: L[:1] = [1]
sage: L
 [1, 0]
pari vectors apparently are not. Are you saying they should be?
Or is it that you don't like the error message?
 
The problem is simply that I only implemented __setitem__ in
the case of an integer input.  He wants a more general __setitem__
to be implemented also for PARI vectors, which are mutable:
sage: s=pari.vector(2,[0,0])
sage: s[0] = 5
sage: s
[5, 0]
 
I think the problem is that I didn't realize "s[slice] = blah"
was a standard Python idiom, so I didn't implement support for
it for the PARI C-library interface.

Actually, this is already fixed:

```
sage: s=pari.vector(2,[0,0])
sage: s[:1]
[0]
sage: s[:1]=[1]
True
```

The `__getslice__` function is also already doctested, so no need to add more. I'm closing this as fixed.

First, `__setslice__` is deprecated: http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/ref/sequence-methods.html

Instead, check for a slice object in the `__setitem__` function.

Also, the slice could have a step as well:

```
sage: a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
sage: a[2:8:2]
[3, 5, 7]
```

Mhh, odd things happen on 64 bit I assume:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx             
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.1.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx", line 2714:
    sage: pari(2**50).length()
Expected:
    4             
Got:
    1
**********************************************************************
```
I would guess this is a 32 vs. 64 bit issue.
