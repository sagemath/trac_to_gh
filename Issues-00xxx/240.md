It seems there are potentially a number of sources of the problem.
Any ideas?     One hint is that if you comment out this line (1462 in js.py)
 
         // active_cell_list = delete_from_array(active_cell_list, id);
 
then the problem mostly goes away.  Of course there are other problems then :-).
 
Anyway, it seems as though the server is maybe returning 'd' when it shouldn't.
