Attachment: **[sage-valgrind_output_place.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket599/sage-valgrind_output_place.patch.gz)**

On IRC it was suggested the place should be $HOME/.sage/sage-memcheck.$PID

Sep 06 19:25:58 <malb>  I vote for $HOME/.sage/sage-memcheck.PID
Sep 06 19:26:23 <wstein>        #599: +1
