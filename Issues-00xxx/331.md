SAGE needs a compiled, well-optimised implementation of dense univariate polynomial arithmetic over a *generic* commutative base ring.

The current implementation is the python class `Polynomial_generic_dense` in `sage/rings/polynomial_element.py`.

The new implementation would probably use a python list to store the coefficients (maybe a C array? I'm not sure...), and would have optimised code for at least the following:

* addition, subtraction
* multiplication: classical algorithm, also karatsuba (but this should be optional, since it doesn't work well over certain base rings, especially where numerical stability is an issue)
* division, at least when the base ring is a field (or for monic divisors), using classical, divide-and-conquer, possibly newton's method
* polynomial evaluation
* retrieval of coefficients and conversion to/from python lists
* comparison, hashing

<a id='comment:7'></a>We already have karatsuba, which leads to really bad bugs like

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: (x+1e20)^2
1.00000000000000*x^2 + 1.00000000000000e40
```

for inexact rings. I don't think there's anything for division yet though.

I totally can't work on this right now.
