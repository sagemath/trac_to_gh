Slight problem is that `__len__()` has to return a python int. Even a long is unacceptable. So this will only work if the curve is not too large, otherwise it will necessarily throw a `TypeError`.

This is essentially completed by #1130.

I think asking for len(E) is not right, in any case -- len(E.points()) makes some sense, and #1130 makes that work.
