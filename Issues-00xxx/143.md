The problem is that, on Mac OS X, gnuplot builds with the flag "-ObjC" (enable Objective C support).  This has to do with support for something called AquaTerm, which it (gnuplot) can use as a display vehicle.

The flag should only be used for the code that actually uses Objective C, but instead it is used for all code; 'Class' is a reserved word for Objective C, and a variable name in the gnuplot code.  Hence...

We need an 'autoconfig' guy!

Since gnuplot is not integrated in any way with SAGE, and won't be a longterm part of SAGE, people should get it some other way (e.g., fink or Darwinports, etc.).  Therefore I've removed SAGE's optional gnuplot package.
