It should have:
* simplify_* methods
* underlying data should be a pointer to a maxima matrix object, so that matrix operations are very fast.


This should also resolve a bug reported by Kate Minola on 20070914 with doctesting 

     sage -t devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/transform.pyx

**Assignee:** @mwhansen

**Resolution:** fixed
