I can confirm this:


sage: help()

Welcome to Python 2.5!  This is the online help utility.

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the Internet at http://www.python.org/doc/tut/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, or topics, type "modules",
"keywords", or "topics".  Each module also comes with a one-line summary
of what it does; to list the modules whose summaries contain a given word
such as "spam", type "modules spam".

help> modules

Please wait a moment while I gather a list of all available modules...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.NameError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/wdj/sagefiles/sage-2.7/<ipython console> in <module>()

```

For other people (e.g., me) there's no problem.  Hmm.
