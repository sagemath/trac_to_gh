There are 2 quirks about random multivariate polynomials outlined below:

1) Degrees are severely restricted:
> The maximum degree in every variable
> is (maximum total degree of resulting polynomial) / (number of
> varialbes of the polynomial). 

2) Too many zero elements. Polynomials generated are too sparse.
> The second point is about the number of coefficients that are set to
> 0. This might a point to argue about, but if I create a random
> polynomial with a  (maximum number of terms to generate) then I expect
> that the 0 occur

I've atached a patch. The individual degree distribution is a little better:

```
sage: f=ZZ['q,w,e,r,t,y'].random_element(degree=5,terms=9) ;f
 3*q^5 - q^4*w + 2*q^3*w^2 + q^2*w^3 - q*w^3*e + q^2*w*r*t + 2*q*w*e*r*t + q^2*e*t^2 + 8*r^2*t^2*y
sage: f=ZZ['q,w,e,r,t,y'].random_element(degree=4,terms=9) ;f
 q^2*w*e + q*w^2*r + q^2*r^2 - 24*w^3*t - 4*q^2*e*t - 5*t^4 - 4*q^3 + 2*q^2*w

the attached file `random_element.py` implements my proposal for this method. It is supposed to guarantee uniformly randomly chosen monomials per default and also supports to choose the degree randomly before choosing a monomial of that given degree.

NOTE: `random_element.py` is not a patch but a `py` file to load/attach into SAGE to test it. I will provide a proper patch if we agree on the strategy.

The general strategy is OK with me. One minor implementation nitpick: I would use ZZ.random_element() instead of randint() because it is faster.

Trying to understand why the good-looking code produced such bad results, I figured out that I had forgotten to merge, so ignore the previous comments. 

There are only two things I'd change:

1. (Minor) There are multiple uses of ZZ.random_element(min,max), especially used to compute degrees in the monomials. I would highly recommend using Python's randint from http://docs.python.org/lib/module-random.html for speed. 

2. (Blocker) Not having default arguments for random_element means it can't be used generically. For example: 

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ['x,y,z'], 2, 2)
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/robert/sage/current/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.py", line 503, in random_matrix
    A.randomize(density=density, *args, **kwds)
  File "matrix2.pyx", line 2752, in sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.randomize
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: function takes at least 2 arguments (0 given)
```

It should not be necessary to special-case the basering being a multipolynomial element before calling random_element on it. Some default should be specified, even if it's degree and terms = 1+abs(ZZ.random_element()). 

Even worse

```
sage: R = QQ['x,y']
sage: S = R['t,u']
sage: S.random_element(d=2, t=3) # BOOM 
```

It is impossible to pass the required degree/number of terms arguments on to the basering of S.

I cannot confirm this:

Sage Integers:

```
sage: l = 0
sage: u = 5
sage: %timeit randint(l,u)
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.random_element(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.63 µs per loop
```

Python Integers:

```
sage: l = int(0)
sage: u = int(5)
sage: %timeit randint(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.65 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.random_element(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.25 µs per loop
```

What am I missing?
