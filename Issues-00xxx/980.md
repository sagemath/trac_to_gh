<a id='comment:18'></a>For the most part, this looks good, but it seems that your algorithm is flawed in some cases (e.g more than two variables?). For example: 

```
sage: [QQ['x,y,z'].random_element() for _ in range(10)]
[-2/3, 1/6, 2, -2/11, 1, 11/2, 1/3, -5, 1/3, 3]
sage: [ZZ['x,y,z,w'].random_element() for _ in range(10)]
[-1, -10, -1, -8, 1, 4, -32, 1, 1, -1]
```

It also has a bias against repeating variables in a monomial. None of these are of degree 7...

```
sage: [ZZ['x,y,z,w'].random_element(7,1) for _ in range(10)]
[-1*w, y*z, -2*x*z*w, -22*x*y*w, -1*z, -5*x*y*w, 7*y*w, x*w, -2*y*z, 2*y*w]
```

<a id='comment:19'></a>Trying to understand why the good-looking code produced such bad results, I figured out that I had forgotten to merge, so ignore the previous comments. 

There are only two things I'd change:

1. (Minor) There are multiple uses of ZZ.random_element(min,max), especially used to compute degrees in the monomials. I would highly recommend using Python's randint from http://docs.python.org/lib/module-random.html for speed. 

2. (Blocker) Not having default arguments for random_element means it can't be used generically. For example: 

```
sage: random_matrix(QQ['x,y,z'], 2, 2)
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/robert/sage/current/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/matrix/constructor.py", line 503, in random_matrix
    A.randomize(density=density, *args, **kwds)
  File "matrix2.pyx", line 2752, in sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.randomize
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: function takes at least 2 arguments (0 given)
```

It should not be necessary to special-case the basering being a multipolynomial element before calling random_element on it. Some default should be specified, even if it's degree and terms = 1+abs(ZZ.random_element()). 

Even worse

```
sage: R = QQ['x,y']
sage: S = R['t,u']
sage: S.random_element(d=2, t=3) # BOOM 
```

It is impossible to pass the required degree/number of terms arguments on to the basering of S.

I cannot confirm this:

Sage Integers:

```
sage: l = 0
sage: u = 5
sage: %timeit randint(l,u)
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.random_element(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.63 µs per loop
```

Python Integers:

```
sage: l = int(0)
sage: u = int(5)
sage: %timeit randint(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.65 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ.random_element(l,u)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.25 µs per loop
```

What am I missing?
