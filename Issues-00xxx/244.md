Bug problems:

1. Find a way to turn off their very verbose output in some cases.  (The documented ways don't work.)
2. Fix / investigate bug where charpoly hangs (see matrix2.pyx).  Or turn off using linbox by default for charpoly, since it's flake.  Or reimplement myself...
  
What will be included in the first release:
* (done) Fast minpoly over QQ
* (done) Fast charpoly over QQ
* (done) Fast dense echelon over Z/nZ
* Fast dense matrix multiply over Z/nZ
* Fast sparse matrix multiply over Z/nZ
* Fast dense echelon over QQ (via multimodular algorithm?)
* Fast sparse echelon over QQ (via multimodular algorithm -- might not use linbox...)
* Fast minpoly over Z/nZ
* Fast charpoly over Z/nZ

Component: **linear algebra**
