Currently, running `sage -valgrind` or `sage -callgrind` uses a hardcoded set of command-line arguments (in local/bin/sage-valgrind and local/bin/sage-callgrind respectively).  There should be some way to change the arguments.

A suggested fix for this is to check if some environment variable

```
SAGE_VALGRIND_OPTIONS
```
and use the content of that if it is defined. I plan to work on this during Bug Day 4.

Cheers,

Michael
