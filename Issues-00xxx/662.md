If I call `sage -notebook` and Firefox/Iceweasel comes up automatically, it crashes on me with 

```
/usr/lib/iceweasel/firefox-bin: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
```

when logging in.

If I start Iceweasel again afterwards, I can log in and everything works. I suspect that this behaviour is caused by the SAGE environment variables (e.g. `LD_PATH`). A fix would be to start the browser with a clean (as in pre-SAGE) environment.
