When valgrinding doctest_matrix2.py the following pops up:

```

```
I fixed the issue in IML and "-testall" passes. The new IML spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/iml-1.0.1.p7.spkg

Before the patch:

```
==4692== LEAK SUMMARY:
==4692==    definitely lost: 6,200 bytes in 147 blocks.
==4692==    indirectly lost: 5,184 bytes in 156 blocks.
==4692==      possibly lost: 377,206 bytes in 906 blocks.
==4692==    still reachable: 37,402,075 bytes in 21,242 blocks.
==4692==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
After the patch:

```
==10896== LEAK SUMMARY:
==10896==    definitely lost: 6,160 bytes in 142 blocks.
==10896==    indirectly lost: 5,184 bytes in 156 blocks.
==10896==      possibly lost: 376,725 bytes in 905 blocks.
==10896==    still reachable: 37,402,500 bytes in 21,245 blocks.
==10896==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
