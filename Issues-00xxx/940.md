```
    sage: t = '"%s"'%10^10000   # ten thousand character string.
    sage: a = octave(t)
```
If you now try to print a, it take forever.

I started with

```
sage: t = '"%s"'%10^10000   # ten thousand character string.
sage: a = octave(t)
```
which took little time.

Then, I did

```
sage: s = repr(a)
```
which I had to interrupt.

Pressing Ctrl-c made the message 

```
^CInterrupting Octave...
```
appear on screen, but nothing more happened. Then, I pressed Ctrl-c again, and finally the traceback was shown:

```
^CERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (80, 0))

And then, I tried to repeat

```
sage: a = octave(t)
```
Now, it took forever, even though the first execution of the line only took a second or so.

Hence, apparently, more is broken than just the output. Perhaps the two problems have a common root?
