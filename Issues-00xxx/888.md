WAIT -- requiring that dsage.setup() has been run is *not* an unreasonable requirement
before doctesting.    How else can we expect to truly doctest that dsage work and have
it eventually appear in examples all over the place, etc.?

To resolve this ticket, we just need to require dsage setup has been run, say at the
beginning of doing "make test".
