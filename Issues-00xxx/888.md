WAIT -- requiring that dsage.setup() has been run is *not* an unreasonable requirement
before doctesting.    How else can we expect to truly doctest that dsage work and have
it eventually appear in examples all over the place, etc.?

To resolve this ticket, we just need to require dsage setup has been run, say at the
beginning of doing "make test".

Just for clarity -- I *have* turned doctesting this file off in this sage release.
But I think the right solution is to require dsage.setup(), and to make it clear
to the user how to do that...
