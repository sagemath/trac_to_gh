I just discovered that it seems quite difficult to download the patch from trac (or I'm being stupid?)

Here's a link:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jbmohler/patches/ntl_renaming.patch](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jbmohler/patches/ntl_renaming.patch)

Note that trac 411 is a pre-requisite!
