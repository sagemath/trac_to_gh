The installation manual says

```
On a newly installed Ubuntu system, you can install the above
commands as follows:

 sudo apt-get install gcc-4.0-base
 sudo apt-get install make
 sudo apt-get install m4
 sudo apt-get install bison
 sudo apt-get install flex
 sudo apt-get install tar
 sudo apt-get install perl
 sudo apt-get install binutils
 sudo apt-get install gcc
 sudo apt-get install libstdc++6-dev
 sudo apt-get install g++
```

I think this should be corrected (changes on 2 lines) to say

```
On a newly installed Ubuntu system, you can install the above
commands as follows:

 sudo apt-get install gcc-4.2-base      # or the latest version available
 sudo apt-get install make
 sudo apt-get install m4
 sudo apt-get install bison
 sudo apt-get install flex
 sudo apt-get install tar
 sudo apt-get install perl
 sudo apt-get install binutils
 sudo apt-get install libstdc++6-dev
 sudo apt-get install g++
```

In fact, in 7.10 "sudo apt-get install gcc-4.0-base" yields
"E: Package gcc-4.0-base has no installation candidate"
and "sudo apt-get install gcc" is redundant.

inst.tex.hg is a bundle against hg_sage. You accidently did hg_sage.send('...') instead of hg_doc.send('...'). Please create a bundle against the docs.
