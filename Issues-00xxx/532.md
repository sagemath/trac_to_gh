<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This is because polynomial_element.pyx has a global (well, module-level) variable holding a RealField:

```
RR = RealField()
```
(As a module-level variable, this never gets freed.)

Each RealField holds two RealNumbers (._zero_element and ._one_element), so they never get freed either.
