This is a pretty vague enhancement. It might be a good thing to have more concrete suggestions.

Create the best vmware SAGE virtual machine that can be put on 1 CD.  Include as many
extra nice options as possible, given the constraint of it fitting on a CD.

It would be nice if there was a upgrade login that would upgrade the whole vmware package including the notebook login. If I do "sudo sage -upgrade" then the notebook login becomes unusable.
