William,

sage-2.8.4.1 built and successfully passed all
tests on the following architectures:

  x86-Linux (pentium4-fc6)
  x86_64-Linux (fc6)

On ia64-Linux, sage-2.8.4.1 only failed one test:
      sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.py
      [...]
      File "base.pyx", line 274, in base.TransformGroup.get_transformation
        self.T = Transformation(self._scale, self._rot, self._trans)
      File "transform.pyx", line 37, in transform.Transformation.__init__
        t = atan2(vy,vz) + pi/2
    ValueError: math domain error

```

Component: **packages: standard**

Looks like itanium sets errno on atan2(0,0), whereas other processors
return 0. Here's a fix.

I am going to rewrite the function to be cleaner and avoid all use of atan.

William,

The patch as written gives the same error.  However if you
change line 37 of the patch from
    if vx == vy == 0:
to
    if vy == vz == 0:
(since atan2() is taking arguments vy and vz) then
I get a different error on ia64-Linux:

sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.py
**********************************************************************
File "plot3d.py", line 19:
   sage: S.show()
Expected nothing
Got:
   6.0
   <type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>
   0.0
   0.0
**********************************************************************
```
