<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

The issue has been solved and needs to be properly documented. If you do

```
export MAKE="make -j4"
make
```
Sage will be build with up to 4 jobs in parallel. Spkgs like Singular which do not build properly with parallel make make sure that MAKE is reset while building themselves.

So somebody send us a patch for the manual. We also need to audit all packages and change make to $MAKE.

Cheers,

Michaek
