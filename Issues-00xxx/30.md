there is currently no easy way for people to implement 
    vectors with left multiplication.  In fact, left multiplication
    doesn't even work right now.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This seems to work for me:

```
sage: v = vector([1,2,3])
sage: v*2
(2, 4, 6)
sage: 2*v
(2, 4, 6)
```
So, should we close this as "worksforme" or did I misunderstand?

Cheers,

Michael
