integrate(1/sqrt(9+x^2))
x/3

I tried this at home and numerous times on sagenb.org.  Every other
plausible syntax of this integral I tried (-1 power, more parentheses,
switch the summands, etc.) yields the same result

Here's the reason

```
(%i1) integrate(1/sqrt(9+x^2),x)
;
                                         x
(%o1)                              asinh(-)
                                         3


```
