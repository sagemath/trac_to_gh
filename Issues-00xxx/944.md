"sage -t ." should run the doctests in the current directory, but it doesn't.  It looks like maybe it fails when the directory name starts with a period:

```
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial$ ~/sage/sage -t .
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
cwitty@magnetar:~/sage/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial$ ~/sage/sage -t ../polynomial/
