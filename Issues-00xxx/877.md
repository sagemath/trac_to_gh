# Issue 877: "sage -coverage" should not care about functions which are local to other functions/methods

Currently, if you have something like:

```
def foo():
    def bar():
        pass
    pass
```
then "sage -coverage" will complain that bar() has no docstring or doctests.  However, such functions cannot be (directly) doctested, so that warning is invalid.  In my opinion, bar() should not be required to have a docstring either.

Looks good to me:

BEFORE:

```
< Overall weighted coverage score:  77.8%
< Total number of functions:  22395

AFTER

```

The code looks fine and it works fine, so far as I can tell.

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
This is what I observe regarding John's patch. In Sage 4.1 without the patch `trac_877-scripts-coverage2.patch`, we have 

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  77.8%
Total number of functions:  22398
```
Applying that patch to Sage 4.1:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  78.3%
Total number of functions:  22210
```
If I understand John's patch correctly, it doesn't count functions which are local to other functions/methods. This accounts for the reduced number of total functions after applying the patch. Moving on to Sage 4.1.1.alpha0 without the patch:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  78.0%
Total number of functions:  22497
```
And with the patch:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  78.5%
Total number of functions:  22308
```
Here is the coverage after applying the patch to my merge tree:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  78.6%
Total number of functions:  22317
```


Merged `trac_877-scripts-coverage2.patch` in the scripts repository.
