}
```
A file with this content (w/o the "==="'s) shows the problem:

```
def Foo(x)
    x = 1
```

After load/attaching this file, typing "??Foo" prints only the 'def' line.

If the file looks like this (i.e., with an 'extra' blank line):

```
def Foo(x)
    x = 1

```

then '??' works properly.

Fixed in ncalexan's local tree by 34c022ed2482.

This requires the doctest.ELLIPSIS option be added to local/bin/sage-doctest, so I haven't sent it upstream yet.  When I finish touching the testing infrastructure, I'll send it along, or ask for it :)
