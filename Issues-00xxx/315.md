This wizard interface would have a menu that I could call using \"WizMode()\". In fact there could even a special SAGE commandline interface from the start based on a config file in the user's home directory. So I if I had the config file saying I wanted this, then I would see a greeting followed by a nice menu. This would be good for me if say I wanted to let a friend, who didn't know anything about programming or SAGE, use my laptop to work on their homework. Also it could be nice to use the wizard interface as a tutorial system since the user would see the output code. \n\nComponent: **user interface**\n\n_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/315_\n\n",
