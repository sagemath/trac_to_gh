If I used it, I would be asked different questions based on do I want a public notebook, advanced, simple, name, description, etc. Once I answered all the questions, the wizard would return me back to the commandline and have all the code I need ready for me to execute. This wizard interface would have a menu that I could call using \"WizMode()\". In fact there could even a special SAGE commandline interface from the start based on a config file in the user's home directory. So I if I had the config file saying I wanted this, then I would see a greeting followed by a nice menu. This would be good for me if say I wanted to let a friend, who didn't know anything about programming or SAGE, use my laptop to work on their homework. Also it could be nice to use the wizard interface as a tutorial system since the user would see the output code. \n\nAssignee: **@TimothyClemans**\n\n_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/315_\n\n",

I think this is basically just a Python question.  One can write interactive Python programs
that use SAGE as a library...
