I've had an icon sitting on my desktop for about a week now.  When I click on it, and it starts a notebook in a background terminal and spawns a browser.  I'd like to be able to click it a second time, and open another browser window, instead of the current behavior of attempting to start another notebook.

Should work something like this:

```
if not notebook_is_running:
    notebook(settings from commandline, open_browser=True)
else:
    open_browser(settings from commandline)
```

I don't get it.  If I do

```
$  sage -notebook directory=foo port=8001 & 
$  sage -notebook directory=bar port=8002 
```
then when I execute the second line it might just pop up a notebook server pointed at port 8001.   Actually, given the line:

```
cmd = "notebook(" + ",".join([wrap(v) for v in sys.argv[1:]]) + ",port=" + SAGENB_PORT + ")"
```
I think it would give an error, since port= is specified twice. 

This is because you introduced a new environment variable SAGENB_PORT which isn't documented.  I don't know why it is there.  I think you should get the port from the port= option on the command line.

I think you should get port= from the command line and get rid of the SAGENB_PORT environment variable. 

Also, you use:

```
DOT_SAGENB = os.environ.get('DOT_SAGENB', os.path.join(os.environ['HOME'], '.sage', 'sage_notebook.sagenb'))
```
but actually, you need to use the file `os.path.join(D, 'twistd.pid')` where D is the option specified in directory= in the command line.

Finally, I think this code should be in the notebook(...) command in Sage itself.  It's wrong putting it here in this shell script, because it only half way fixes the problem.  E.g., imagine a user that types the following and leaves that in a console:

```
sage: notebook()
```

Then in another console, they type

```
sage: notebook()
```
Instead of giving an error, it should just given them the notebook.
If you put this code that you've just written in the notebook command, then both problems are automatically solved, whereas with the current code location, only half the problem is really solved.

Also, there is a notebook(fork=True) option, so one can do

```
sage: notebook(fork=True)
The notebook files are stored in: sage_notebook.sagenb

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
On OS X this doesn't work at all.  Depending on what I do either I get two notebook servers running simultaneously on the same directory (bad), or I get "Another twistd server is running, PID 40940".

On OS X there is no /proc filesystem.  However, when I run this code from this patch:

```
        try:
            print 1
            # First check using /proc directory
            if os.path.exists('/proc/%d'  % twistd_pid):
                launch_browser_to_nb()
                return
            else:
                remove_pidfile(twistd_pid_path)                
        except:
            print 2
```
I don't see "2" printed, i.e., no exception is raised.   That's clear if you read the code -- you don't raise an exception.

* If a server is running and `open_viewer=True`, get the settings from the old `twistedconf.tac` and browse to the server's home page.
* Use `return` instead of `sys.exit`, in case of command-line invocation.
* Some [pep8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/) changes.
* Rebased for this queue
