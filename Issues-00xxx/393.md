There is something very wrong with this behavior of this code, which tries to convert 1/2 to a 2x2 matrix.  The problem seems not to be in the matrix code, but since it's hard to reproduce it appears in that form.

**Keywords:** real, rational, coerce

Here is the output of the attached routine, which essentially does the same thing 3 times and gets 3 different answers!
