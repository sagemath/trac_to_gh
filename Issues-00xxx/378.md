The patch allows

```python
sage: load_attach_path()
['.']
sage: load_attach_path('/path/to/my/sage/scripts')
sage: load_attach_path()
['.', '/path/to/my/sage/scripts']
sage: attach('nifty_script1.sage')
sage: attached_files()
['/path/to/my/sage/scripts/nifty_script1.sage']
```
You can also set an environment variable:

```sh
$ export SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH="$HOME/foo:$HOME/bar"
$ sage
sage: load_attach_path()
['.', '/home/mpatel/foo', '/home/mpatel/bar']
```
Note:  We now use the full path in the attached files dictionary.

-I thought it could work something like this:
-As a command line option it could be like an include path or a library
-path to gcc, i.e. every option "-I path" (or any other name of the
-switch, this is the one for includes in gcc) is added to the existing
-default list of paths. This could be useful e.g. when calling sage
-from a launcher, in which case you could put these options in the
-launcher so that it will always be called with these paths when ran
-from the launcher.
-As an environment variable it could work just like LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
-PYTHONPATH or MAGMA_PATH: a list of paths separated by colons (or some
-other separator) whose constituents are also added to the existing
-list of paths. For reasons of implementation, maybe it is easier to
-just use PYTHONPATH for sage files as well.
-If this list would be directly accessible from sage, as in python
-where it is stored in sys.path (which is read/write), and moreover
-there were the possibility to specify a startup script which would be
-executed just before entering the session (like in magma when called
-with -s, or in bash and many other linux programs where it is a
-standard file .bashrc), then you could also append your paths to the
-standard list in the startup script.
-When calling "load" or "attach" from sage with a non-absolute path, it
-would cycle through this list, concatenating the paths with the string
-passed to load or attach, until it finds the file.
-If you consider this useful, and you could implement any of these in
-sage, that would be great!

Is this still alive? I found myself in need of this functionality today and was surprised it is not there; how does anyone use the notebook locally without it?

Anyway, I'd like to help out fixing or reviewing if necessary.
I've only glanced at the current patch but found this anomaly: Shouldn't line 1399 be changed to 

```
while '' in _load_attach_path:
```
so as to remove any number of empty entries (e.g. if user wrote SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH = ":::::foo::")

Cheers, Johan

I've had a bit of a hack at exposing the array itself, but there are problems making it sufficiently global.  `sys.path` works for the stdlib because `path` is a variable in the `sys` module.  The logical thing to do here is to create a `load_attach_path` variable in the preparser module, but following the stdlib analogy this would require the user to edit `sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_path`, which is not very user friendly.

Failing this, it looks like the best you can do is a `from sage.misc.preparser import load_attach_path`, but this is a fragile state of affairs: if you reassign `load_attach_path` anywhere, either from sage's command line or by calling some function like `sage.misc.preparser.reset_load_attach_path()`, you end up with a situation where `load_attach_path` and `sage.misc.preparser.load_attach_path` are different objects.

This requires caution on the part of the user and the programmer.  For example, `reset_load_attach_path()` can't include

```
load_attach_path = ['.']
```

instead it has to do

```
while load_attach_path != []:
    load_attach_path.pop()
load_attach_path.append('.')
```

If the user accidentally reassigns `load_attach_path` in the command line, they'll have to re-run `from sage.misc.preparser import load_attach_path`.  I don't think that this step can be included in a `reset_load_attach_path()` function due to the different scopes.

So it's possible to expose the `load_attach_path` array to the user, and I've written most of a patch that does this, but there's lots of things that could go wrong so I'd suggest sticking to the existing patch's approach of hiding behind a function.  If others think that the pros outweigh the cons then I'll tidy up the patch and upload it.

Thoughts?

Very astute! I was almost finished with my own patch, falling into all the same holes as you describe :-) Your concern at least begs the question on whether this is what we want to do, as it might fool some users. However, a possible usage pattern - in case load_attach_path is fully exposed - is the following

```
   import sage.misc.preparser as pre
   pre.load_attach_path = [ ... ]
```

Still, this is not very nice, and doesn't really fit into the "import sage.all" scheme. A third possibility is to "decide" that we might very well need such global variables in other places, stemming from various other foundational modules, and therefore introduce a new module sage.misc.globals to hold these. When Sage launches, it imports this module as "globals", and so, for any global variable - say load_attach_path -, the user would access it and modify it as globals.load_attach_path. I don't think that would be unnatural at all. However, it might be overkill if load_attach_path is the _only_ such conceivable global value, but for some reason (perhaps the sheer size of Sage), I can't really think it is.

If none of these sound compelling, then I vote yes on the current form (I haven't tested the patch, that is). My only comment on the current patch, is that maybe there should be a TODO (or a fix ;-) ) in reset_load_attach_path(), which notes that probably the elements of SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH should be uniquified while preserving the order (thus, list(set(_load_attach_path)) is no good). After that the while could be reverted to an if again when removing the empty element.

Otherwise good work. I'm looking forward to this patch in Sage, whatever the format :-)
Cheers, Johan

Thanks to everyone for working on this ticket!

One question that may relate to how/whether we "expose" the path list:  Would users want Sage to search some paths recursively for files to load or attach?  How would we store this information?  Perhaps as

```python
['/some/path', ('/a/path/to/search/recursively', True), '/another/path']
```
?  Of course, this needn't hold up this ticket.

Do we really need to test for uniqueness at all?

This is an interesting question.  I think it would be a nice feature.  Since we don't actually expose the path array, it would be easy to add such features later, so it's probably best as a new ticket.
