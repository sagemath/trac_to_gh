It may be helpful for users who want to use SAGE graphics on their web
pages to be able to set attributes about the background, like transparency.

The attached patch adds a keyword argument `transparency` to `plot.show()`.  The default value is `None`, which makes the image background opaque.  A number between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque) determines the degree of transparency.

Please test and make changes.  I'm new to the plotting code, so it's likely that I've missed and/or broken something.

Yes, I'm almost sure that #5448 will necessitate an update (or this will necessitate an update of #5448).

1. I would change the keyword argument to something that is used more in Sage (like alpha or opacity) if we are going to have multiple levels of transparency.  If it is just a True/False option, then "transparent" seems like a fine keyword.

2. What do you think about using the "transparent" option of savefig, as documented here: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig ?

3. The transparent option of savefig has the following code.  It looks like this code not only sets the figure patch, but goes through each axes object in the figure and sets the axes patch alpha level.  We should probably do the same.

```
 1036         if transparent:
 1037             original_figure_alpha = self.patch.get_alpha()
 1038             self.patch.set_alpha(0.0)
 1039             original_axes_alpha = []
 1040             for ax in self.axes:
 1041                 patch = ax.patch
 1042                 original_axes_alpha.append(patch.get_alpha())

I added a quick "transparent" option to the patch at #5448.  If you think it is needed, I think this ticket ought to go ahead and implement a "background_color" and/or "background_opacity" keywords, or something like that, that lets a user specify a background color and opacity.

FYI, #5448 did implement the transparency=True/False option to show.  However, this ticket can have larger scope.  I'm slightly enlarging the title/description to reflect that fact.

On the other hand, if it's not wanted, maybe we should close this ticket after all.

A quick (and crude) change to `Graphics.save()` sets up a `background_color` option:

```python
        if savenow:
[...]
            background_color = None
            if kwds.has_key('background_color'):
                background_color = kwds.pop('background_color', False)

            figure=self.matplotlib(*args, **kwds)
[...]
            if background_color:
                figure.patch.set_color(background_color)
                for ax in figure.axes:
                    ax.patch.set_color(background_color)
                # Not sure how to avoid using these:
                options['edgecolor'] = background_color
                options['facecolor'] = background_color

            figure.savefig(filename,dpi=dpi,bbox_inches='tight',**options)
```
If we can avoid using the `savefig()` options, perhaps we can set a background color *and* transparency level entirely in `matplotlib()`.  Then, I think, we could handle combinations like

* `transparent=True, opacity=0.5`
* `opacity=0.8, background_color='#ffbefa'`

in a way a user expects.  Thoughts?
