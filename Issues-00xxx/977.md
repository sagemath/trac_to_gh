It seems that this is only happening with the identity element. Here's an example:

```
sage: R = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = R([1])
sage: type(f.expand())
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl'>
sage: f = R([1,2])
sage: type(f.expand())
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl'>

# But all of the polynomials returned should be multi-polynomials

sage: f = R([1,3,2,4])
sage: type(f.expand())
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element.MPolynomial_polydict'>
```
