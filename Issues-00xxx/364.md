Some uses of a ring that has no variable names assigned will cause an exception to be raised, even though there need not be any  names.  An example is appended.  The problem is that row_space() will cause the creation of a ring's fraction field, if there is not already one.

My fix, in rings/ring.pyx:CommutativeRing.fraction_field(), is to return without setting variable names, if no names are assigned.

Thoughts:

1) In structures/parent_gens.pyx:ParentWithGens.variable_names(), an exception is raised if no names are assigned.  Is this the proper behavior?  If you call this function, is the presumption that you *know* there should be names assigned?

2) Are there cases where the creation of a fraction_field *should* raise an exception if there are no assigned names?

I think all fraction fields should have their names assigned in the fraction field constructor.
I've modified 2.5.1 so this is the case.  

All fraction fields should have variable_names() set on creation.  It was a mistake to omit
that from the constructor.
