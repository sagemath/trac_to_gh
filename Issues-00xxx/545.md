To do:

1. log.statement(...) could return a "LogicalStatement" object, which has a nice print  method -- __repr__(self) --, and a _latex_ method.  

```
   class LogicalStatement:
      def __init__(self, ...)
          ...
```
Then this might work:

```
    sage: s = log.statement("a&b|!(c|a)")
    sage: s
    a&b|!(c|a)
    sage: s & s
    a&b|!(c|a)&a&b|!(c|a)
    sage: s.truthtable()
    ...
    sage: show(s.truthtable())    # calls _latex
    nice typeset version
```

2. Here:

```
  sage: s = log.statement("a&&b")
  Malformed Statement
```
    instead of printing, do 

```
       raise ValueError, "malformed statement"
```


3. Don't use "eval" for a name, since that's a builtin Python.  

4. Shift this over to line up with the r:

```
def eval(toks):
    r"""
        This function is for internal use by the class SymbollicLogic.
        It returns 'True' if the exression contained in toks would
```

5. Every function should have example doctests.  And to test do this:

```
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/logic
$ sage -t logic.py    
```

6.  varaibles --> variables

7. Delete the vars stuff from the inputs in the docs here and clarify how they are used elsewhere:

```

        INPUT:
            self -- the calling object
            s -- a string containing the logic expression to be manipulated
            global vars -- a dictionary with the variable names and
                          their current boolean value
            global vars_order -- a list of the variable names in
                                the order they were found
```
   Also, at the top of the file document that vars and vars_order are used
to simplify passing information around between various eval* functions.
Or better just make all the eval functions be methods of the LogicalStatement class, if that makes sense. 

8. Possibly clarify what valid variable names are -- in the error message.

Hi William,

Sorry about the long delay with getting this code to you, I got a little sidetracked with school and all.  But, here it is.  At this point I believe I've fixed all the issues listed in ticket 545 as well as incorporating all of Pablo De Napoli's ideas and implementing cnf conversions and a DIMACS satformat output method.  I'm not sure if you want to post the code on the trac ticket, or in the repository, or elsewhere.  If you could let me know where it goes I can start soliciting advice on the devel group though.

I have some ideas/questions for where the code should go next, but getting this release accepted first is probably at the top of the list.

From Pablo De Napoli:

```
Chris: many thanks for sending the new version of your code.
I think that it is a great work. Actually I see that you have
implemented many of
my previous suggestions like: using the the builting True/False
from python instead of strings, using a tree to parse propositional
formulas, avoid using the OPAN/CPAN tokens, etc.) and thank you for adding me
as an author (eventhough
I've not actually writen a single line of the code)

 I'll review it in more detail and tell you if I see something that can
be still improved.

Pablo

While browsing the code I noticed lots of stuff that seemed overly verbose (and inefficient), e.g. 

```
        124     def eval_ifthen_op(lval, rval): 
 	125	    r""" 
 	126	    This function returns the logical 'ifthen' operator applied to lval and rval. 
 	127	 
 	128	    INPUT: 
 	129	        lval -- boolean value to the left of the ifthen operator. 
 	130	        rval -- boolean value appearing to the right of the ifthen operator. 
 	131	                                     
 	132	    OUTPUT: 
 	133	        Returns the logical 'ifthen' operator applied to lval and rval.   
 	134	 
 	135	    EXAMPLES: 
 	136	        sage: import booleval 
 	137	        sage: booleval.eval_ifthen_op(True, False) 
 	138	        False 
 	139	        sage: booleval.eval_ifthen_op(False, False) 
 	140	        True 
 	141	    """ 
 	142	    if(lval == False and rval == False): 
 	143	        return True 
 	144	    elif(lval == False and rval == True): 
 	145	        return True 
 	146	    elif(lval == True and rval == False): 
 	147	        return False 
 	148	    elif(lval == True and rval == True): 
 	149	        return True 
```

which could be summarized as 

```
return not lval or rval
```

Also, the operators are passed around (and compared) as strings everywhere (sometimes '&', sometimes 'and'). I think it would be better to use `operator.not_`, `operator.and_`, etc. and use `is` to compare, and then one can also write stuff like 

```
return op(lval, rval)
```

rather than having big if-then-else statements. 

Having a global `__vars` seems fragile as well. 

Sorry it's taken so long to get this in, the boolean formula simplification stuff looks good, I just think some of it could be greatly improved.

For the patch **logic.patch**, below are some possible fixes for improving its documentation. I was reviewing the plain text version of the diff, not the online version. This accounts for the number that precedes each line in the diffs below. In other words, such a number refers to the line number in the downloaded, plain text diff file, which should simplify the task of reviewing my suggestions.

45. Please carefully read through the following snippet from the original diff file:

```
590 +        We can now create truthtable of rows 1 to 5
591 +            sage: s.truthtable(1, 5)
592 +            a      b      c      value
593 +            False  False  True   False
594 +            False  True   False  True
595 +            False  True   True   False
596 +            True   False  False  False
```
Why "rows 1 to 5" when you're using the command `s.truthtable(1, 5)`? My understanding is that `s.truthtable(1, 5)` includes row 1 all the way up to but excluding row 5. In effect, that command actually creates 4 rows, excluding the standard header row. Perhaps you might want to consider this diff:

```
590 -        We can now create truthtable of rows 1 to 5
590 +        We can now create a truth table of rows 1 to 4, inclusive.
```
or this one:

```
590 -        We can now create truthtable of rows 1 to 5
590 +        We can now create a truth table of rows 1 to 5, exclusive.
```

```

49. No tabs, please. This issue is especially important since we're using Python and most folks who program in Python use only spaces --- NOT tabs --- for their indentation. For official reasons why tabs are not used, please refer to [PEP 666](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0666/). The [Sage Developer's Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prog/prog.html) provides various general guidelines to be adhered to when writing code (and documentation) to be included within Sage itself. In particular, you might want to consult [this section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prog/node6.html). If you feel that my comment is unfair to you, please don't flame me. Instead, provide me with reasons why it's unfair (to you). If your reasons turn out to be valid and they show that I'm being unfair, I'd stand corrected and offer you my apology.

I'm having trouble applying the patch **logic.hg**. For example, I've received this abort message:

```
sage: hg_sage.patch("/home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage-mvngu-review/patch-review/logic.hg")
cd "/home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage" && hg status
cd "/home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage" && hg import   "/home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage-mvngu-review/patch-review/logic.hg"
applying /home/mvngu/usr/bin/sage-3.1.4/devel/sage-mvngu-review/patch-review/logic.hg
abort: no diffs found
```
OK, so perhaps it's because **logic.hg** is bzip2 compressed:

```
$ file logic.hg 
logic.hg: Mercurial changeset bundle (bzip2 compressed)
```
But why can't I do bunzip2:

```
$ bunzip2 logic.hg 
bunzip2: Can't guess original name for logic.hg -- using logic.hg.out
bunzip2: logic.hg is not a bzip2 file.
```
Any other way(s) of getting the diff file(s) bundled in **logic.hg**?

Positive review, this should go into the 3.3 series.

@Michael:
For this ticket, only two of the patches are to be applied (I tested against Sage3.3.alpha0 on my Mac) to the Sage Library (devel/sage-main):

* "logic4.patch" (should apply cleanly, credit: Chris Gorecki)

* "trac_545_latex.patch" (should apply, but with one hunk succeeding only with fuzz, credit: Wilfried Huss)

Note 1: The "logic4.patch" is essentially the "logic3.patch", but such that the files do not go into "devel/sage/logic/", but into "devel/sage/sage/logic", where they belong. For the doctests to pass I also changed lines like "sage: import propcalc" into "sage: import sage.logic.propcalc as propcalc", and I removed linebreaks/backslashes in the "Expected Output" so that the true output now does match the expected output. Probably one should adjust the "all.py" in the "sage/logic" subdirectory in an appropriate way, but I wanted to do only minimal invasive changes to the original ("logic3") patch.

Note 2: I have not tried any ReSTification. But I would rather have it in 3.4 without Sphinx documentation, than having to rewrite the patches for this ticket for 3.4.1 again, given the age of the ticket. Wil might have an opinion on that.

Note 3: One of the six new files, the file "boolopt.py", says in it: "Copyright 2006 (c) Michael Greenberg.  NewBSD license, listed below ...". The terms listed are definitely compatible with GPLv2+, as far as I can tell, but IANAL. (The other five files are entirely written by Chris Gorecki, and are "Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)".)

Note 4: This "other" file boolopt.py misses doctests on its own, but the functionality provided is well tested implicitly by using it in other ones of these six files. This is OK from my side, but probably a """nodoctests""" should be added --- or the code has to be refactored on a larger scale --- or this one file would have to be put in its own micro-spkg.

Note 5: There definitely is further work to be done on the "sage/logic/" part of Sage, e.g. the old "logic.py" file most probably should be thrown out, "all.py" should be adjusted, and so on. But please, please, please open new tickets for that!

Thanks for catching the two "long" doctest failures I let slip by. They're indeed trivial to fix.

Concerning the coverage: I'm at a loss here.

Please see my "Note 4" from above about the file "boolopt.py", which would have either to be refactored (i.e. rewritten) completely, or one would have to add lots of meaningless doctests, look at the following code snippet:

```
    def visit_prop(self, node, children):
        self.props.add(children[0])

    def visit_notprop(self, node, children):
        self.props.add(children[0])

    def transform_node(self, node, children):
        return [[tuple([node] + children)]]

    def transform_or(self, node, children):
        return children[0] + children[1]


```

Thoughts?

Cheers, gsw

Urgh.

Currently this ticket already has three different patches to be applied from three different guys.

I've made my case, please another one step in and review this, thanks!

In my experience, the motivation to increase coverage is the highest when trying to get something in. 

How essential is boolopt.py to the rest of the package? Could it be pushed to a separate ticket (enhancement). 

boolformula.py could probably be brought up to 100% without too much effort.

Ahh, excellent idea, this was just the input needed here. Robert, thank you very much!

So now what's to do (if nobody else does it, I'll do it):

- move the file "boolopt.py" to its own (enhancement) ticket "with patch, needs work" (easy)

- adjust the other five files of this patch so that they are stand-alone (rather easy, essentially only the "simplify" function in boolformula.py is concerned)

- add the two missing doctests to boolformula.py (very easy)

Please note that the file "logic.py" which has missing doctests according to the coverage report above is not among the new files, but already a part of Sage!
(So it couldn't possibly block this ticket to finally go in. But of course, it needs to be cleaned up itself.)

In the class BooleanFormula there is a spelling mistake in a function name,
"equivlant" instead of equivalent. The same mistake is repeated a few times
in the documentation.

Minh, thanks for your good work!
After applying the five patches Minh mentioned in the correct order to Sage-3.4.2.alpha0, the equivlant.patch didn't apply. So I rebased and made it such that Wilfried's name appears in it as originator.

Positive review to the sequence of five patches Minh mentioned. And positive review to the changes of Wilfried (I really did nothing but rebase them). The main author here is Chris Gorecki, of course.

After this ticket is finally closed (Requiescat In Pacem), the next steps would be to dismiss "logic.py" (I think it becomes mostly obsolete by this patch here), add the "rest" as a logic chapter to the Sphinx documentation (probably this needs some work, but hopefully some scripts will be available to help), and finally work on/solve #5910. 

Cheers, gsw
