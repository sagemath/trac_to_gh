This functionality is already provided in the SAGE notebook by putting #auto somewhere
in a cell.  Also, using %hideall one can even hide the global code.  

It's odd, because I've seen you use this functionality in your example sage notebook
applications, so you know about it.  Hmm.

I said notebook not worksheet. I'm talking about writing a function or class in a global worksheet from I could use from anyother worksheet. #auto has nothing to do with global just writing a function in a cell makes that function global for the whole worksheet that the function is defined in.
