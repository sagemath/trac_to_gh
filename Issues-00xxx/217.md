There was some work done for QQ and Jaap seems to be working on this for ZZ, so what is the status of this?

Cheers,

There was track #931 and there is more optimization in the pipeline.

This will not only work for ZZ, but for all base rings.

I will send a patch (relative to sage-2.8.9) shortly.

Are you sure?    I just had a look at trac #217, and your changing Py_ssize_t
into int specifically *introduces* bugs into that code.  E.g., suppose the input
were a 1 x 2^33 matrix.  Then you did this in your patch:

-        cdef Py_ssize_t m, n, r
+        cdef int m, n, r

Lower down one has:
        m = self._nrows
	n = self._ncols

Now, instead if the code working like it used to, there will be an overflow,
and one will get total nonsense.

This patch is likely fine if the int's are changed back to Py_ssize_t.

I am of course well aware of the fact that it would be impractical to compute permanents of large matrices.  But still, writing code that
overflows and gives nonsense on "impractical input" is bad coding
style.  Especially because such code my give nonsense quite quickly.
This is almost exactly the same situation in spirit as the situation
that leads to people writing insecure code that leads to buffer overflows,
because they don't bother doing proper error checking, since "nobody
would give input like that...".
