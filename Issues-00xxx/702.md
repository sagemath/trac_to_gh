The above patches are one such proposal. NOTE: it has not been decided whether or not to include this feature. However, I like it. 

```
sage: [1..10]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sage: n = 5
sage: [1..n]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sage: [0,2,..,10]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
sage: [0,2,..,10,20..30]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30]

sage: (0,2,..,10)       
<generator object at 0xc57cd78>
sage: A = (5,7,..)
sage: [A.next() for _ in range(20)]
[5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

```

And a non-trivial example

```
sage: L = [1..5]
sage: [L[4], .., next_prime(10), 3, 2, 1]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 3, 2, 1]
