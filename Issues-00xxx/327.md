In sage base check of prerequisites should also check for perl 5.8.  According to Kevin 
Buzzard, building maxima using perl 5.6 fails with this error, but upgrading to perl 5.8
resolves the problem:

```
"Unknown open() mode '<:crlf' at ./build_index.pl line 25".
```

Yes, it can be closed. The configure script is generated from this bit of code I wrote in configure.ac

```
# The stats program R 2.9.2 needs perl 5.8.0 or later.
# If anything needs a later version, then this should be updated.
AC_PATH_PROG([PERL],[perl])
AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([5.8.0],[],[AC_MSG_ERROR([Sorry, your version of perl is too old]) ])
```

The 'AC_MSG_ERROR' will cause the build to terminate at that point.
