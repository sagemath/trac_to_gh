```

Yes, it can be closed. The configure script is generated from this bit of code I wrote in configure.ac

```
# The stats program R 2.9.2 needs perl 5.8.0 or later.
# If anything needs a later version, then this should be updated.
AC_PATH_PROG([PERL],[perl])
AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([5.8.0],[],[AC_MSG_ERROR([Sorry, your version of perl is too old]) ])
```

The 'AC_MSG_ERROR' will cause the build to terminate at that point.
