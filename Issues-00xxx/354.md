Given the flux of the new notebook, and the fact that this works well for me, I'm going to close this.  If it can be duplicated with newer code, I'll address the issue.

Works for me:

```
[mabshoff@m940 sage-2.8.3.alpha2]$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.3.alpha2, Release Date: 2007-08-29                |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: F = ZZ.quo(2*ZZ)
sage: R.<x> = F['x']
sage: p = x^2-1
sage: p.root_field?
sage:
sage:   
```

Retagged for 2.9.

The problem is in the notebook, not the console application. So this is not resolved and should be fixed.
