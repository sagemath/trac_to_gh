Offending code:

```
F = ZZ.quo(2*ZZ)
R.<x> = F['x']
p = x^2-1
p.root_field?
```

Traceback:

Given the flux of the new notebook, and the fact that this works well for me, I'm going to close this.  If it can be duplicated with newer code, I'll address the issue.

sage: F = ZZ.quo(2*ZZ)
sage: R.<x> = F['x']
sage: p = x^2-1
sage: p.root_field?

Retagged for 2.9.
