They are not reused.  The code is there in interfaces/singular.py,
but it's not used right now because everything I tried to reuse
or clear variables in Singular resulted in all kinds of problems,
probably partly because Singular is somewhat statically typed.
I've always meant to look into this again.   In the other interfaces
(which are all dynamically typed) variables are recycled when they
aren't used anymore.

Indeed.   Please feel free to work on fixing this.
