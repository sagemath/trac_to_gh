The whole "substitute" architecture was implemented in SAGE
long after monoids were implemented.  So you'll have to implement
monoid substitution.

Just do the arithmetic.    All monoids have a 1 by definition, so 1*y is just "y"
in that monoid.

A positive review for me.

Note: I did all doctests, and got exactly 22 Segfaults, as with vanilla 4.3.3 (see #7773).
Thus if a new failure occurred within one of those 22 doctests, I couldn't see it.
