*  Some algorithms haven't been completely implemented.  (Some do things I never implemented in MAGMA.)
    - finish modular forms algorithms
    - enable modular forms doctests and test and fix
    - finish implementing modular symbols factorization in general (eisenstein part is currently not fully implemented)
    - computation of period mapping
    - more testing, examples, etc., for modular symbos for GammaH

This ticket seems like a high priority item. It is a little stale and William ought to update what has happened. If there are only small issues left we should close this ticket and open individual tickets for the remaining items.

Cheers,

Michael
