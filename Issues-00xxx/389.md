There is a bug in the mpfi C library for interval arithmetic, which leads to an infinite loop in SAGE:

```
wonder if there is something wrong with the interval cosine
calculation?  cos seems to loop forever on [-1 .. +1].  Try this:

sage: x = RealInterval(-1.1,1.1)
sage: x.cos()
[0.453596121425577307 .. 1.00000000000000000]
sage: x = RealInterval(-1.0,1.0)
sage: x.cos()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.KeyboardInterrupt'>     Traceback (most recent call
last)

/files/home/nholtz/<ipython console> in <module>()

------



Just as a followup, in case anyone cares ...

The problem is definitely in libmpfi, as I can duplicate
the infinite loop problem in computing mpfi_cos([-1.0,1.0]) in C.

I have notified the maintainers of libmpfi, and we'll see what
happens.

The following code reproduces the problem:

```
#include "mpfi.h"

int main()
{
    mpfi_t SinX,X;
    mpfi_init(X);
    mpfi_init(SinX);
    mpfr_set_si (&(X->left), -1, GMP_RNDN);
    mpfr_set_ui (&(X->right), 1, GMP_RNDN);
    mpfi_cos (SinX, X);

}
```

Attachment: **[389.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket389/389.patch.gz)**

There is a new MPFI spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/cwitty/mpfi-1.3.4-rc3.p9.spkg that fixes this (it also includes a minor fix from Paul Zimmerman, for mpfi_ui_sub()).

The attached patch adds a doctest for the new package.  With the old spkg, the doctest will loop forever; with the new spkg, it works.
