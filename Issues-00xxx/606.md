```
From the notebook,

```
%sh
cat > hello.pyx << EOF
def hello(name):
    """
    Print hello with the given name.
    """
    print("Hello %s"%name)
EOF
```

```
load "hello.pyx"
Loading of file
"/opt/sage-2.8.3.rc3/sage_notebook/worksheets/admin/0/cells/0/hello.pyx"
has type not implemented.
```

There is a function that currently just checks to see if the filename extension is .py or .sage before it tries to load the file.
