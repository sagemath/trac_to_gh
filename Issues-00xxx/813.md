This should give similar results, but it is inconsistent:

```
P1.<x>=QQ[]

P2.<y>=P1[]

f=x+y

P3.<x,y>=QQ[]

P3(f)

I accidentally came accross this stone age ticket.

For the record: Current behaviour as of sage-4.7.rc2 is

```
sage: P1.<x>=QQ[]
sage: L=P1.fraction_field()
sage: x=L(x)
sage: P2.<y>=P1[]
sage:
sage: f=x+y
sage:
sage: P3.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage:
sage: P3(f)
x + y
sage:
sage: 0*P3.0+f
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/home/king/<ipython console> in <module>()

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/sage-4.7.rc2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/element.so in sage.structure.element.RingElement.__add__ (sage/structure/element.c:11959)()

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field'
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: P3
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

The question thus is: Should there be a coercion from P3 to the parent of f? Then one should implement it. Otherwise, the ticket should be closed as invalid.

Let fP be the parent of f, hence, the polynomial ring in y over the fraction field of the polynomial ring in x over the rationals.

There *is* a coercion to fP from the polyomial ring in y over the polynomial ring in x over the rationals:

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import get_coercion_model
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: fP = f.parent()
sage: cm.explain(fP, QQ[x][y])
Coercion on right operand via
    Conversion map:
      From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
      To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Arithmetic performed after coercions.
Result lives in Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

However, there is no such coercion from the bivariate polynomial ring in x and y over the rationals:

```
sage: cm.explain(fP, QQ[x,y])
Will try _r_action and _l_action
Unknown result parent.
```

I think there should be such coercion! What do you think? I guess I'll also ask sage-devel.

Meanwhile I believe that this is *not* invalid. Namely, we have the following:

```
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: pushout(QQ['x','y'],Frac(QQ['x'])['y'])
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

Hence, arithmetic between `QQ['x','y']` and `Frac(QQ['x'])['y']` should work! But it doesn't:

```
sage: QQ['x','y'](1) + Frac(QQ['x'])['y'](1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field'
```

What is the problem? The conversion is fine:

```
sage: Frac(QQ['x'])['y'](QQ['x','y'](1))
1
```

But in fact there is no coercion into the pushout:

```
sage: pushout(QQ['x','y'],Frac(QQ['x'])['y']).has_coerce_map_from(QQ['x','y'])
False
```

That's a bug, I think.

Here is my plan for implementing a coercion of `P = QQ['x','y']` into `Q = Frac(QQ['x'])['y']`.

Since conversion of P into Q works, we only need to make `Q._coerce_map_from_(P)` return True.

Let p be an element of P. When converting p into Q, the multivariate polynomial p is transformed into a univeriate polynomial via p. This is done using `p._polynomial_(Q)`, which ultimately boils down to `Q(p.polynomial(P('y')))`:

```
sage: P = QQ['x','y']
sage: p = P.gen(0)
sage: Q = Frac(QQ['x'])['y']
sage: Q(p.polynomial(P('y')))
x
```

`p.polynomial(P('y')).parent()` lives in a stacked polynomial ring:

```
sage: p.polynomial(P('y')).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
That stacked ring coerces into Q:

```
sage: Q.has_coerce_map_from(p.polynomial(P('y')).parent())
True
```

Conclusion: If we want to test whether a multivariate polynomial ring P coerces into a univariate polynomial ring Q in variable y, then we need to try and transform P into a *univariate* polynomial ring P' in variable y; here, we have `P'=QQ['x']['y']`. There is a coercion from P into Q if and only if there is a coercion from P' into Q.

I already have a patch, but "surprisingly" the additional coercion yields some doctest errors in other places.

The problem with my approach is that it would create a bidirectional coercion, namely a coercion from `QQ['x','y']` to `QQ['x']['y']` in addition to the coercion from `QQ['x']['y']` to `QQ['x','y']` that already exists.

But I think I have an idea that would solve the problem.

My original idea was to have a coercion from P to Q if there is a coercion from `P.remove_var(Q.variable_name())` to `Q.base_ring()`. That created the bidirectional coercion.

My modified idea is to have the coercion from P to Q *only* if `P.remove_var(Q.variable_name())` is different from `Q.base_ring()`, but coerces into it. Hence, a coercion only takes place if the rings become more complicated, thus avoiding circles.

The tests in sage/rings/polynomial pass. I am now running all doc tests, and then I can hopefully submit my patch...

Attachment [trac813_univariate_coerce_from_multivariate.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket813/trac813_univariate_coerce_from_multivariate.patch) by @simon-king-jena created at 2011-08-02 17:11:41

I think I was able to solve the problem. With my patch applied on top of sage-4.7.1.rc1, all tests seem to pass, and one can do

```
            sage: P = QQ['x','y']
            sage: Q = Frac(QQ['x'])['y']
            sage: Q.has_coerce_map_from(P)
            True
            sage: P.0+Q.0
            y + x
```

In order to avoid bidirectional coercions (that would break a lot of tests), I have

```
            sage: Q = QQ['x']['y']
            sage: Q.has_coerce_map_from(P)
            False
            sage: Q.base_ring() is P.remove_var(Q.variable_name())
            True
```

The rule is: If `Q.base_ring() is P.remove_var(Q.variable_name())` then there can not be a coercion from the multivariate ring P to the univariate ring Q; in fact, there is a coercion in the opposite direction. But otherwise, there is a coercion if `Q.base_ring()` has a coercion from `P.remove_var(Q.variable_name())`.

Good question. I think it was meant as analogy to the method `univariate_polynomial` of multivariate polynomials. But really, it seems unneeded to have that method. Could probably be dropped, if you prefer (needs to be tested, though).
