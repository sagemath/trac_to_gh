Currently `Integer.__index__()` goes via a python long. In most cases the result should be just a python int, and it should be much faster to go directly there.

Probably the best way to implement this is to first call `mpz_size(x.value)` to check the size in words; if the size is one, then construct a python int directly; otherwise go to a long.

Even better might be to write another version of `mpz_get_pylong` which can produce a python int when that's feasible, or a long if it's not.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Here's a profile, on sage.math, sage 2.8.1:

```
sage: L = [None] * 10
sage: index = Integer(5)
sage: timeit x = L[index]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 690 ns per loop
sage: timeit x = L[index]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 691 ns per loop
```

Let's see if we can do better than that...
