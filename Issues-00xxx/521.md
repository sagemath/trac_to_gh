I got started on writing doctests, see 521.patch. I'm not going to finish now, but still worth merging I guess. (Also there's a lot of code in there that robert wrote, which I'm not comfortable doctesting.)

The patch also makes some minor optimisations.

Ummm this is weird.

All of the following on 2.10.2.alpha0:

If I try patching using the command you used above, I get the same failure.

However, if I'm in the directory devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, and I just do `hg import 521.patch` then it works fine.
