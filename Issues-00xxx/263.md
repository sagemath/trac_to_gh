<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>             Traceback (most recent call last)

The traceback is through a bunch of non-SAGE code.  It was not clear to me where to begin to look.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This is not a bug.  Almost *NO* SAGE objects will pickle with the
Pure-python defeault pickle module, which simply can't support
the sort of sophisticated things needed for pickling SAGE objects.
Instead use either the save method, or dumps or loads, which uses
cPickle in mode 2. 

```
sage: I=CyclotomicField(4).gen()
sage: loads(dumps(I))
