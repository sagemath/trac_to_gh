Note - the quick option in the relabel function was originally an optimization for the graph_isom code, and no longer applies, since it is never used. Other than that purpose, it doesn't make sense to have it as an option, so I'll just remove it.

Here is another aspect:

```
sage: G._nxg.adj
{0: {1: [None]}, 1: {0: [None]}}
sage: H._nxg.adj
{0: {1: [None, None]}, 1: {0: [None, None]}}
sage: G == H
True
```
