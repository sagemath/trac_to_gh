Try the following:

```
sys.stdout.write('hi there')
sleep(2)
```
While sage is sleep()ing, you'll see the full text.  When it finishes, the e disappears.  ?????


Messing with stdout from the notebook seems like a categorically bad idea.  I've found that any of the following commands cause the notebook to hang.

```
sys.stdout.close()
sys.stdout.next()
sys.stdout.read()
```

I have found a trivial workaround.  If we tack an extra print statement onto the end, it works fine.  But why do we have to do this?  Mysterious. 

```
  sage: sys.stdout.write('hi there')
  sage: print
  hi there
         ^ ----- w00t
```

Fixed.

There was some interaction between the code that asks for an updated list of variables that have been defined and this problem.  

I changed a few lines in sage/server/notebook/worksheet.py to the following:

```
        if not C.introspect():
            input += 'print "\\n\\n%s'%SAGE_VARS + '=%s"%_support_.variables(True)'
```
