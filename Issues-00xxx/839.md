The second thing I try -- use R's install.packages -- leads to problems:

```
sage: r.inst[tab key]
r.install_packages    r.installed_packages  
sage: r.install_packages('HSAUR')
Error: object "sage3" not found
sage: r.install.packages('HSAUR')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>        Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/was/edu/2007-2008/sage/<ipython console> in <module>()

<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'RFunction' object has no attribute 'packages'
```

This *does* start to work, but eventually fails (that this fails may be my fault -- maybe HSAUR is not longer at CRAN):

```
sage: r.eval('install.packages("HSAUR")')

**some ideas** and what i'm trying next: (help welcome)

i think installing packages is rather difficult. at my computer, i even don't see the GUI selector or anything else, just hangs. your output, last line, says: `dependency MASS  is not available`. .. but MASS should be pretty standard ...

i'll add a default mirror in the options, but this alone solves nothing. there is a command line option when calling R itself: ` R CMD INSTALL ... ` maybe it's easier to work on that level? separate process and different cmd window...

a good solution could be to avoid installing + local compilation and just ship more packages with R (in standard) and repack additional libraries of packages into optional SPKGs. i think this should be pretty straightforward (R could be easily convinced to search in multiple paths for packages if necessary ...)

i've also not figured out how to plot and why there are missing sage<number> objects. there are certainly many bugs. i'll also try to introduce my custom prompt (appending a command to each line of code) and running R in full silent mode (no prompt, no questions, no nothing, reduced warnings level, ...). restore from last session and searching directories for stored configurations was also enabled --- disabling all this should give much less surprises ;)

also there are bugs in the R-2-Sage converter. e.g. i just had to explain python that NA means None ...

i should also check some details inside the bundled R inside the `./sage -sh` environment. possibly there is something wrong with it, too...

REFEREE REPORT:

* I fixed most of the issues I have with typos in docs, incompleteness of docs, etc., in 
sage-839-referee1.patch which should be looked over by Mike Hansen and Schilly.

* There are still some bugs and serious issues, but they are not show stoppers.  They include:
    * Installing optional packages seems completely broken on OS X.  Maybe also on Linux. 
    * Functions that don't exist:

```
sage: r.nonexistfunction(5)
Error: object "sage1" not found
```
That should give a proper error message.  Also, after doing the above, for some reason all the text in the rest of my session is BOLD.
