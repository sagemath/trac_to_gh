Hello,

there is another issue with gp:

File "gp.py", line 324:
   sage: ComplexField(10)(gp(11243.9812+15*I))
Exception raised:
   Traceback (most recent call last):

     File "<doctest `__main__`.example_10[2]>", line 1, in <module>
       ComplexField(Integer(10))(gp(RealNumber('11243.9812')
+Integer(15)*I))###line 324:
   sage: ComplexField(10)(gp(11243.9812+15*I))
     File "/tmp/Work2/sage-2.8.1/sage-2.8.1/local/lib/python2.5/site-
