Currently we print something like:

```
failures:

        sage -t  calculus/calculus.py
        sage -t  functions/constants.py
<SNIP>
```
It would be nice if we get more precise failure reports, something like:

```
failures:

        sage -t  calculus/calculus.py: 1 out of 27 tests failed
        sage -t  functions/constants.py: segfault
        sage -t  server/notebook/twist.py: CTRL-C invoked
```

Component: **doctest coverage**
