Here's one which must be an incorrect boundary check:
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.0, Release Date: 2007-01-28                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
sage: p = 2^32+15
sage: FF = FiniteField(p)
sage: a = FF(2)
sage: a^0
 
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
```

Component: **basic arithmetic**
