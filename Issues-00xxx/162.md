This code (which I noticed in `Integer.exact_log`) causes a segfault:

```
sage: x = 3
sage: bits = 31699256
sage: R = RealField(bits)
sage: y = R(x)
sage: z = y.log()
```

I haven't investigated the underlying cause.

It's mpfr (=gmp) running out of memory.   I don't know how or if it is
possible to resolve this -- they might make assumptions in those libraries
that preclude us dealing with the problem.  These things were much worse
with GMP-4.0, by the way...

Looking again, it's basically just that GMP doesn't work with ridiculously
large precisions -- it just dies. 

Interesting, MAGMA seg faults on exactly the same sort of computation, and of course MAGMA uses GMP/MPFR behind the scenes:

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

This is a basic mpfr problem.  Any super-high precision arithmetic breaks with SAGE or Magma:

```
was@ubuntu:~$ magma
Magma V2.13-10    Thu Aug 16 2007 02:54:37 on ubuntu   [Seed = 3360329821]
Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
> R := RealField(31699256);
> y := R!3;
> z := y*y;
Segmentation fault
was@ubuntu:~$    

Same on 64-bit:

was@sage:~$ magma
Magma V2.13-5     Thu Aug 16 2007 02:56:05 on sage     [Seed = 4101418455]
Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
> R := RealField(31699256);
> y := R!3;
> z := y*y;
Segmentation fault
was@sage:~$   
```

Proposed solution -- in SAGE, don't allow construction of RealField(n) for
n > 2^23.
