Those two issue show up with varying size, there might be more, I didn't check in greatest detail but I will revisit this issue down the road.

When valgrinding devel/sage-main/sage/rings/finite_field_givaro.pyx with 100% coverage now shows no leak when using the givaro.spkg from #2525. Hence this ticket should be closed once that ticket is merged.
