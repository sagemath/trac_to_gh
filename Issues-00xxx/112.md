The whole gap_reset_workspace() idea is bad.  It just doesn't make any sense at all!
Here's what should happen.   

1. When a new gap component is installed a file in <SAGE_ROOT> is touched.

2. When SAGE starts, if the user's local gap_workspace is older than the file in 1,
then it is recreated.

That's it!

the admin user to change it.  That's fine since it should only be changed when
new packages are installed anyways.
