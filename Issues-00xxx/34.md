```
   sage: M = ModularSymbols(Gamma0(22),2,sign=1)
   sage: M1 = M.decomposition()[1]
   sage: M1
   Modular Symbols subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Symbols space of dimension 5 for Gamma_0(22) of weight 2 with sign 1 over Rational Field
   sage: M1.is_simple() ## throws a TypeError
```

In fact, I can find lots of examples where this happens: levels 6, 7, 8, and 9 with weight 24 all have subspaces which crash is_simple.

I don't really know if this qualifies as "critical," but it seems more than just "annoying." Maybe the page name should be clarified (at least to me)?

This throws notimplemented error now.  The problem is that actually implementing this in general efficiently is hard.  Because it's now a not implemented error, I've changed this to an enhancement.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
This, as well as the other cases listed in Craig's post, work for me in sage-3.0.alpha5.

I think this was fixed as a side effect of Craig's various fixes in the modular symbols code.
