It would be great if something like the following worked:

```
sage: F = CyclotomicField(7)

sage: z = F.gen()

sage: G = F.galois_group()

sage: phi = G.random()

sage: z.galois_action(phi)
```

Also needed, I think, are embedding into CC.
AFAIK, neither of these has been entered onto the SAGE
"wish list".

Complex embeddings were written long ago.  In your example above, try:

```
    F.complex_embeddings()
```

This is quite usable:

```
sage: F = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: z = F.gen()           
sage: G = F.embeddings(F)   
sage: G

  Defn: zeta7 |--> zeta7,

  Defn: zeta7 |--> zeta7^2,

  Defn: zeta7 |--> zeta7^4,

  Defn: zeta7 |--> -zeta7^5 - zeta7^4 - zeta7^3 - zeta7^2 - zeta7 - 1

[zeta7,
 zeta7^2,
 zeta7^3,
 zeta7^4,
 zeta7^5,
 -zeta7^5 - zeta7^4 - zeta7^3 - zeta7^2 - zeta7 - 1]
```

One could easily implement F.autumorphisms() to return F.embeddings(F), but in fact there is already End(F) -- whose existence I discovered by doing F.galois_group?

So what should be done is to change the structure returned by F.galois_group() which is <class 'sage.rings.number_field.galois_group.GaloisGroup'> to be derived from that of End(F) which is <class 'sage.rings.number_field.morphism.NumberFieldHomset'>,  which does not look very difficult to me...

This one was almost fixed by #5159; but unfortunately the above snippet didn't quite work, because my new GaloisGroup class derived from PermutationGroup_generic, and the random_element method of that class always returned a PermutationGroupElement (rather than a GaloisGroupElement, which has more functionality).

The above patch makes the necessary tiny changes to the permutation groups code so this now works, although the interface is slightly different from the above:

```
sage: F.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: G = F.galois_group()
sage: phi = G.random_element()
sage: phi(z)
z^4
```
