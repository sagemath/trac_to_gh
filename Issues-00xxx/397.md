The attache file is a patch to allow the following code to work:

```
sage: e = 7
sage: e.digits(2)
[1, 1, 1]
sage: e.digits(3)
[1, 2]
sage: e.digits(10)
[7]
sage: ZZ(e.digits(3),3)
7
```
The return type of ZZ.digits() is a list with Integer entries in little endian order.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
