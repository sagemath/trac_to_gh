```
[mabshoff@m940 sage-2.8.1]$ cython -v
Cython (http://cython.org) is a compiler for code written in the
Cython language.  Cython is based on Pyrex by Greg Ewing.

Usage: cython [options] sourcefile.pyx ...

Options:
  -v, --version                  Display version number of cython compiler
  -l, --create-listing           Write error messages to a listing file
  -I, --include-dir <directory>  Search for include files in named directory
                                 (multiply include directories are allowed).
  -o, --output-file <filename>   Specify name of generated C file
  -p, --embed-positions          If specified, the positions in Cython files of each
                                 function definition is embedded in its docstring.
  -z, --pre-import <module>      If specified, assume undeclared names in this
                                 module. Emulates the behavior of putting
                                 "from <module> import *" at the top of the file.
