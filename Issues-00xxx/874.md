I have naive code (= compute Smith Normal Form) written to do both of these now. I need to get it cleaned up and included (which means figuring out where it goes in sage/matrix/), but I wanted to put a note up to avoid duplication of work. 

That said, if someone has an interesting/clever algorithm, it's probably better than what I've written, so that should be submitted.

William points out that for JCF over exact fields, using A.decomposition() will probably be much better.

2. implements the base_ring argument mentioned above

- make another ticket saying we still need a rational canonical form algorithm
- note in the docstring for Jordan canonical form that the algorithm is the naive one

Does that seem reasonable?

So I agree with Jason's earlier comments on IRC that this ticket should be put to bed already. I have only two minor nitpicks:

* it's going to need to be re-based against 2.10.2 when it's out
* I think `jordan_form()` should take an optional argument `subdivide=True`, 
 which it passes off to `block_diagonal_matrix`. (This is just so that the user can 
 control whether or not the matrix gets printed with blocks shown, which I know 
 most people probably like, but I personally find annoying.)

Jason, if you want to do that real quick when 2.10.2 is out, I'll give it a positive review.
