I have naive code (= compute Smith Normal Form) written to do both of these now. I need to get it cleaned up and included (which means figuring out where it goes in sage/matrix/), but I wanted to put a note up to avoid duplication of work. 

That said, if someone has an interesting/clever algorithm, it's probably better than what I've written, so that should be submitted.

William points out that for JCF over exact fields, using A.decomposition() will probably be much better.

It's interesting that Jason had so much faith in my code -- apparently William's skepticism was warranted. :) It turns out that it's terrible right now -- on small examples, it's roughly 5X slower than Jason's, and it's still running on a large example (where your code took 7.5 sec). 

The problem is easy to understand when you look at the code: to compute the Smith Normal Form of T-x*I, I work over a polynomial ring, and there's neither (1) specialized polynomial arithmetic (i.e. as in the ZZ[X] case) nor (2) a specific type for matrices of polynomials (at least that I know about!).

Does that seem reasonable?

So I agree with Jason's earlier comments on IRC that this ticket should be put to bed already. I have only two minor nitpicks:

* it's going to need to be re-based against 2.10.2 when it's out
* I think `jordan_form()` should take an optional argument `subdivide=True`, 
 which it passes off to `block_diagonal_matrix`. (This is just so that the user can 
 control whether or not the matrix gets printed with blocks shown, which I know 
 most people probably like, but I personally find annoying.)

Jason, if you want to do that real quick when 2.10.2 is out, I'll give it a positive review.
