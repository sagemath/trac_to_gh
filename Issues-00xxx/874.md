I have naive code (= compute Smith Normal Form) written to do both of these now. I need to get it cleaned up and included (which means figuring out where it goes in sage/matrix/), but I wanted to put a note up to avoid duplication of work. 

That said, if someone has an interesting/clever algorithm, it's probably better than what I've written, so that should be submitted.

William points out that for JCF over exact fields, using A.decomposition() will probably be much better.

I agree with Michael's sentiment above that this should get merged -- maybe merge it, and:

- note in the docstring for Jordan canonical form that the algorithm is the naive one

Does that seem reasonable?

So I agree with Jason's earlier comments on IRC that this ticket should be put to bed already. I have only two minor nitpicks:

* it's going to need to be re-based against 2.10.2 when it's out
* I think `jordan_form()` should take an optional argument `subdivide=True`, 
 which it passes off to `block_diagonal_matrix`. (This is just so that the user can 
 control whether or not the matrix gets printed with blocks shown, which I know 
 most people probably like, but I personally find annoying.)

Jason, if you want to do that real quick when 2.10.2 is out, I'll give it a positive review.
