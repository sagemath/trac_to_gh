Hi,

This is a quick and possibly not so useful answer. 
(1) I think you're running into a bug in Maxima (hence Sage) below, since
your assumption should be passed through.  It's pretty hard for us Sage
developers to fix bugs in Maxima, unfortunately.   Nonetheless, we are
very thankful for the bug report.

(2) Possibly doing the following workaround would be OK for you, i.e.,
just compute the definite integral you want by computing an antiderivative
and use the fundamental theorem of calculus:

sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: f = log(x^2+y^2)
sage: integrate(f,x)
x*log(y^2 + x^2) - 2*(x - atan(x/y)*y)
sage: g = integrate(f,x)
sage: h = g(x=1.) - g(x=0.0001415); h    # this is what you want.
1.00000000000000*log(y^2 + 1.00000000000000) - 0.0001415000000000000000*log(y^2 + 0.000000020022250000000000000000) - 2*(1.00000000000000 - atan(1.00000000000000/y)*y) + 2*(0.0001415000000000000000 - atan(0.0001415000000000000000/y)*y)
sage: h(y=5)

Note that is((y-1)*(y+1)>0) returns unknown.  If you say assume(y>1),
integrate doesn't ask about that anymore. But it still asks about
y^2+x^2+2*x+1.  It should know that x > 0 and y > 0 here.

I've noticed this many times when running my integration tests. Axiom handles these kinds of integrals by returning multiple solutions. Maxima could do the same and that's what I think is the best solution.

One possible solution on the Sage side would be to add optional parameters to answer the questions. So, the first time one tries the integral, you get the trackback so you re-run the integration with an added parameter to answer the question (or series of questions for problems with several branches). 

Since the questions are yes/no based, another option arises, that is more difficult to implement but better for the user. This would be to have an option for Sage to build up the branches by re-running the integration answering the questions automatically and noting the solution and the question+answer.

Both of these Sage solutions require improvements to the pexpect interface which are likely non-trivial.

It should be pointed out that:

1. Changing the left endpoint from 0.0001415 to 0.0001414 caused the error in this case. Mysteriously, doing the endpoint 0.0001415 in maxima_console() still has two questions for you, but Sage nonetheless answers it!

2. assume((y-1)*(y+1)>0) or whatever doesn't work -  and even if it did, Maxima does have an actual bug in not recognizing that x is positive from the integral we wanted to calculate.  So a question-and-answer framework, while definitely helpful, wouldn't solve this particular issue.
