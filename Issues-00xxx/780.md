Hi,

This is a quick and possibly not so useful answer. 
(1) I think you're running into a bug in Maxima (hence Sage) below, since
your assumption should be passed through.  It's pretty hard for us Sage
developers to fix bugs in Maxima, unfortunately.   Nonetheless, we are
very thankful for the bug report.

(2) Possibly doing the following workaround would be OK for you, i.e.,
just compute the definite integral you want by computing an antiderivative
and use the fundamental theorem of calculus:

sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: f = log(x^2+y^2)
sage: integrate(f,x)
x*log(y^2 + x^2) - 2*(x - atan(x/y)*y)
sage: g = integrate(f,x)
sage: h = g(x=1.) - g(x=0.0001415); h    # this is what you want.
1.00000000000000*log(y^2 + 1.00000000000000) - 0.0001415000000000000000*log(y^2 + 0.000000020022250000000000000000) - 2*(1.00000000000000 - atan(1.00000000000000/y)*y) + 2*(0.0001415000000000000000 - atan(0.0001415000000000000000/y)*y)
sage: h(y=5)

I've noticed this many times when running my integration tests. Axiom handles these kinds of integrals by returning multiple solutions. Maxima could do the same and that's what I think is the best solution.

One possible solution on the Sage side would be to add optional parameters to answer the questions.

It should be pointed out that:

1. Changing the left endpoint from 0.0001415 to 0.0001414 caused the error in this case. Mysteriously, doing the endpoint 0.0001415 in maxima_console() still has two questions for you, but Sage nonetheless answers it!
