Okay, first off the current LinBox.spkg from 2.8.2 needs some cleanups because there are unneeded files in patches that are just copied over. That causes the "NTL check for > 5" to fail. The other problem appears to be that givaro as well as LinBox have different and probably incompatible gmp++.h header files. The current LinBox.spkg also abuses CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and CPPFLAGS and that is due to some bugs in LinBox's config system.
