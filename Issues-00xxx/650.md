Actually, I discovered a second place where this needed to be turned into a NotImplementedError. I replaced the above bundle with a fix for both.

22:55 < cwitty_> #650: applies cleanly, but the doctests fail.  It's odd...unless Mercurial is screwing 
                 up the history somehow, it looks like the doctests never could have worked after this 
                 patch.
22:57 < williamstein> I think the doctests were wrong.
22:57 < williamstein> I.e., they claimed a result that was mathematically wrong.
22:59 < cwitty_> Right.  But the patch comments out the doctest "N = ...", but leaves the next doctest 
                 alone, "N.basis()".  Why didn't he comment out that doctest too?
22:59 < williamstein> It's a mistake on his part.

As the comments above point out, I was too hasty in commenting out the other doctests, and didn't test it due to lack of time. I updated the patch to comment out the last three doctests I missed on the first run, and I'm about to upload it.
