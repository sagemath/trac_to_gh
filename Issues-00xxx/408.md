This is on Mac OS X, 10.4.10, with Safari, using SAGE 2.7.1.

If I create a worksheet, fiddle around with it, and then quit and restart the server,
going to "localhost/8000" gives me a page with the worksheet shown (as possibly
one of many).  If I click the adjacent check box and then the DELETE button, the
check box is cleared but the worksheet entry remains.  Only when I 'refresh' the page
does the worksheet entry disappear.

I think this is indeed safari-specific.  I think for some reason safari doesn't
update the page when the javascript attempts a refresh, though firefox does.
We need to either directly modify the DOM (more work, but the right thing to do), 
or improve the refresh() javascript function so it also works with safari.

This is quite an old ticket. Can somebody check with 3.0 if this is still a problem?
