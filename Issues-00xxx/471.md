Hello,

Trac Mercurial plugin -  see http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracMercurial
Add to Ticket Properties - Component: 
- Misc
- Documentation

It would also be nice if trac could send an email to sage-devel if a ticket were added, but that might cause too much traffic. As an alternative we might install an RSS plugin.

Cheers,

Michael

One correction: Martin Albrecht did inform me that there already is a RSS feed. Still, Firefox 2.0 doesn't pick it up (at least for me).

And another problem: Attached Postscipt files are displayed as raw test. Is this a config or a general Trac issue.

Cheers,

Michael
