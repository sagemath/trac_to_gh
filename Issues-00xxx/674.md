I'm cc:ing Dr. Kirkby on this since he is likely to have a way to test this easily.  Unfortunately, it seems this fix - whatever it was - was never integrated.

If the subject lines is to believed, then this was Solaris 10 x86. I do not have such a system. I've got Open Solaris (Solaris 11) on x86 and Solaris 10 on SPARC. But I do not have any Solaris 10 x86 system. I could install Solaris 10 on a virtual machine, but I don't have it running just now and would rather concentrate on Solaris 11 (Open Solaris). 

I'm not getting any doctest failures with the name *sympow* in them. I know nothing about this package, but I do not see anything obviously wrong on Solaris 10 SPARC.

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Bypassing shell configuration files ...

sympow 1.018 RELEASE  (c) Mark Watkins --- see README and COPYING for details
```

There is a copy of Sage 4.3 at /rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.3 on 't2'. If you are able to test that there, it would be helpful, but I do not see the obvious crash. But x86 could be a different matter of course.
