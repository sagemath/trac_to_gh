If the subject lines is to believed, then this was Solaris 10 x86. I do not have such a system. I've got Open Solaris (Solaris 11) on x86 and Solaris 10 on SPARC. But I do not have any Solaris 10 x86 system. I could install Solaris 10 on a virtual machine, but I don't have it running just now and would rather concentrate on Solaris 11 (Open Solaris). 

I'm not getting any doctest failures with the name *sympow* in them. I know nothing about this package, but I do not see anything obviously wrong on Solaris 10 SPARC.

Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything

```

There is a copy of Sage 4.3 at /rootpool2/local/kirkby/sage-4.3 on 't2'. If you are able to test that there, it would be helpful, but I do not see the obvious crash. But x86 could be a different matter of course.
