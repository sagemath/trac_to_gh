The following is incorrect:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^3 - 5)

sage: L.<b> = K.extension(K['x'].0^2 - 3)

sage: b.matrix()
 
[0 1]
[0 0]

sage: M.<c> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^2 - 3)

sage: c.matrix()
 
[0 1]
[3 0]
```

Keywords: **extension numberfield matrix polynomial**

Component: **basic arithmetic**

This is simply not implemented, and will be hard to do without rewriting number fields completely :-)
David Roe?

Anyway, in sAge-2.8 it raises a notimplementederror, so I've changed this from bug to enhancement.

William

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^3 - 5)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(K['x'].0^2 - 3)
sage: b.matrix()

sage: sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^3 - 5)
sage: sage: L.<b> = K.extension(K['x'].0^2 - 3)

I would actually say that this was fixed by roed's rewrite. So it would be "fixed" in my book.
