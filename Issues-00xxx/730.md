Because the order returned by iterkeys is not guaranteed, enum, and therefore, `__cmp__` do not seem to behave well.  This could possibly be fixed by sorting the boundary vertices in the vertices() function.

```
sage: g=Graph({0:[1,2],'a':[1],1:[0,2],2:[0,1]})
sage: h=Graph({'a':[1],0:[1,2],1:[0,2],2:[0,1]})
sage: enum(g)
9174
sage: enum(h)
9174
sage: g.set_boundary([0,'a'])
sage: h.set_boundary([0,'a'])
sage: enum(g)
13018
sage: enum(h)
9174
sage: g==h
False
sage: g.vertices()
[0, 'a', 1, 2]
sage: h.vertices()
['a', 0, 1, 2]
```

It seems that since the graphs are the same, with the same labels and everything, the equality test should return True.  However, the boundary vertices are not sorted, so g.vertices() and h.vertices() return in a non-specified order.

Why do we return the boundary vertices first anyway?

This patch fixes the problem noted above by redefining vertices() to return just a list of vertices and then patching various places to explicitly sort the output of vertices().  An option to vertices, boundary_first=True, outputs the boundary vertices first (but sorts the boundary vertices, so it still is deterministic).

The patch takes this approach so that vertices() can be more efficient (it doesn't have to loop through and separate out the boundary vertices any time someone wants a list of vertices).  However, this does break backward compatibility (previous versions returned the boundary first by default).
