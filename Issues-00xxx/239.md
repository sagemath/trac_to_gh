About this I just found this bug:
 
sage: x=maxima('x')
 
sage: x^(3/4)
 x^3/4
 
sage: x=maxima('2')
 
sage: x^150
 1427247692705959881058285969449495136382746624
 
sage: x^(3/4)
 2
 
sage: maxima(3/4)
 3/4
 
Greg
```

Greg's problem is that the exponent is rounded maybe, since `x^(3/4)` should be the same as `x^(maxima('3/4'))`.

This is now fixed for sage 2.1.   The fix involved making __pow__ more careful (to raise an error in many cases).
