Just posted a patch. Issues that still need to be resolved:
* could do better when converting with _sage_() remote objects
* the _remote_tmpfile is defaulted to "/tmp", I am not sure that's a good idea, and if we shouldn't just return an error if (server_tmpdir is None) and not (server is None)

also, removed expect.tmp as this was confusing:
there ought to be two different temporary files in expect.py. one would be _local_tmpfile and interact with sage/python and the other one _remote_tmpfile and interact with the remote CAS session. 
allowing for something named tmp in expect.py is confusing as people who program more interfaces don t tend to think of the distinction needed when doing things remotely, and end up using the same file for both (without scp'ing one to the other if is_remote())
