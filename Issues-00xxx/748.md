A couple commets:

* Arne merged the nullspace patch and a couple of the other fixes. Some of the other fixes no longer apply
* spkg-install does odd things, i.e  fall back to non-ATLAS which is no longer needed
* The SPKG needs some general cleanup
* on OSX without creating 'repl' the build on the vanilla sources fails
 
Arne is putting together some 1.0.3 release which we can then test in Sage

Thanks, that will help. We cannot run autotools at build time, only at packaging time, since we don't have autotools as a dependency of Sage, nor do we package it in Sage. So rather than including your patch I guess I should apply it, run autotools, and then save *that* diff as a patch to apply at build time.

The first hunk is manually edited, as is the hunk adding the file `repl/dummy.c`; the rest are created by running automake in the src directory.

There are a couple of things that worry me, such as the `-version-info 1:0:1` near the end of the diff. Does that mean that autotools are misunderstanding the version of IML as 1.0.1 instead of 1.0.3? Why does a similar line not already exist in that file? As far as I can tell, I made sure I was using the same versions of autotools that the authors of IML were - autoconf 2.59, automake 1.9.6, and libtool 1.5.22.

Anyway, I'll try again with your patch instead of this dummy function and see what's different. This time I'll also try the whole autotools suite by running `autoreconf -i` (as recommended to me by Jeroen) - is this what you recommend too, fbissey?

I am otherwise positive that #10508 is opening the possibility of ATLAS on OS X - but all spkg using blas/lapack need to be adjusted for it to be useful.

Patching the detection can be done orthogonally to getting atlas, the autodetection is a tricky business in this case.

Sage still pass its (not long) tests.

Why merge tinyatlas.patch into sage1.patch?

On top of that I don't really get the use of the tinyatlas patch.
The function it defines (in a header file) is used nor in IML nor in Sage.
I'm testing Sage without it (no problems for IML).

So maybe renaming sage1.patch to memory.patch and discarding tinyatlas.patch would be enough.
And lets move the sage3_memleak.patch to memleak.patch while at it.

Because those patches seem related: `sage1.patch` adds some include for `tinyatlas.h`.

> On top of that I don't really get the use of the tinyatlas patch.

That's certainly not true. The files `RNSop.c` and `certsolve.c` in the `src/src` directory in `IML` use `catlas_daxpby()`.

My guess is that's a function which normally comes from ATLAS, but which is needed on systems where ATLAS is not installed.

It seems to be true with IML 1.0.3 but not with 1.0.1 indeed.
(I mean the daxpby function was needed in 1.0.1 but is not anymore in 1.0.3.)

+   ATLAS has not been installed.
+ * build.patch: Made build scripts that work.
  * configure_default_cflags.patch: get rid of the following error
    during configure:
      ./configure: line 18624: -O3: command not found
- * Modified some of the examples, and made build scripts that work.
+ * examples.patch: Modified some of the examples.
+ * memleak.patch: use mpz_set_ui instead of mpz_init_set_ui on mpz
+   which is already allocated.
+ * remove_repl.patch: Do not build/install src/repl at all, since it
+   does nothing anyway and creating empty archives fails on OS X.
