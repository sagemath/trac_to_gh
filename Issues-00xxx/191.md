It would be very nice if SAGE had a large table/database of integers
of special forms whose factorizations are known, since a huge amount of work has already been done on this.  The SAGE factor command could consult such a table, before applying other more general techniques. 

For example, on the number theory list:

```
Look in the file
 
http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~ssw/bell/r1
 
for the factorizations of p^p - 1 for most p < 180.
 
(If you change "r1" to "r2", you get the factors of p^p + 1.)
 
For the meaning of the "L" and "M" notation, see the papers at
 
http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~ssw/bell/index.html
```
So a person really wanted to factor some numbers `p^p -1`, but couldn't
with PARI.  If SAGE had tables of the factorizations of those numbers,
it could have done it via a lookup, and the verbose message could have
given the above reference.  Something similar would be good for a huge
range of classes of prime numbers.   This would be an excellent student
project. 

I believe the Cunningham project has large tables of factored integers
of a special form. This might be a useful resource for those wanting to
undertake this project.
