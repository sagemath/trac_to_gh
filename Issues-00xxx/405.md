There is no SAGE equivalent yet.  David's example might be helpful
below though.  The best you could in SAGE is set each entry
one at a time right now.  I should add something.  

def set_row(A, r, v):
    for i in range(A.ncols()):
         A[r, i] = v[i]

I'm not sure how we forgot to ever do this.
