Maybe you need to type "make" again to finish the install?  The problem
is happening midway through the install, not at the end.  
It is completely uneccessary to " Regenerating files that hardcode the
install PATH (please wait a few seconds)..." during the build, so
I an make sure this doesn't happen during the build.  If one ever
gets a hang after build when this happens, that would be a serious 
problem.  Does it for you, i.e., after finishing the install by typing
"make" again, if you move the entire install directory, then run SAGE,
does the above message only appear for a few seconds, then SAGE starts
up?
