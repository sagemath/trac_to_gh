Replying to [ticket:797 jason]:

Here is some account of what happens in Sage 3.2.3:

```
sage: %time [1..10]
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

So, the first problem is not a problem anymore.

```
sage: %timeit [1..10]
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<magic-timeit>", line 6
     [1..10]
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

So, that is the only remaining issue. I am now looking at `sage/misc/sage_timeit.py`.

I somehow got the impression that it is an issue with preparsing, for the following reason:

```
sage: timeit('[1..10]',preparse=False)
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<magic-timeit>", line 6
     [1..10]
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This is the same error as in 

```
sage: %timeit [1..10]
```

In the code, by default preparsing should be done; namely, in `sage_timer.py` it says

```
def sage_timeit(stmt, globals, preparse=None, number = 0, repeat = 3, precision = 3):
...
    if preparse is None:
        preparse = interpreter.do_preparse
```

Now, we also have

```
sage: from sage.misc import interpreter
sage: interpreter.do_preparse
True
```

So, it *should* be with preparsing.

For testing, I inserted a line in the code that prints the value of `preparse`.

The curious thing is that this line is executed when doing `timeit('[1..10]')` or `timeit.eval('[1..10]')`, but it is *not* executed when doing `%timeit [1..10]`.

I was just told that `%timeit ...` should do the same as `timeit.eval('...')`, but apparently it doesn't. So, perhaps it is a problem with the `%`?

Can you tell me where the behaviour of `%` is defined?

When you run %timeit from the command-line, it runs code in IPython and does not touch any code in the Sage library.  The issue is that the IPython magic command "%timeit" doesn't do the preparsing.  Fernando was working on an upstream fix for this.  An easy downstream fix for this would be to do as I suggested above and overwrite the IPython version of timeit with our own with the expose_magic function.

```
sage: _ip.expose_magic("timeit", lambda self, s: timeit(s))

The right place to put this would probably be in local/bin/ipy_profile_sage.py.

Thank you!

While you replied, I tried to post the following:

> Are you doing this in the notebook or the command-line?  They're two totally separate things.


It is command-line, and I don't know what happens on the notebook. Can you test it?

If it is in `preparser_ipython`, then the following might be the source of trouble:

```
def preparse_ipython(line, reset=True):
    global num_lines
    global q_lines

    L = line.lstrip()
    if L.startswith('%'):
        # This should be installed as an Ipython magic command,
        # but I don't know how yet...
        L = L[1:].strip()
        import sage.interfaces.all
        if L.lower() in sage.interfaces.all.interfaces:
            switch_interface(L.lower())
            return "''"
        else:
            # only preparse non-magic lines
            return line
```

Hence, if the line starts with `%` and if the word after `%` is not the name of an interface than simply the line is returned unchanged. 

But what happens afterwards? In the end of the day, `%timeit` gets an interpretation and does call some `timeit` command!

> Can you hop on IRC?


I try (I never used IRC before). So, if it works, see you soon.

 Simon

In `preparse_ipython`, lines starting with `%` have not been changed unless they refer to some interface. I added support for `%timeit`.

Idea: Call `timeit.eval`

With the patch, the following examples now work:

```
sage: %timeit [1..10]
625 loops, best of 3: 127 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit 'a'=="a"
625 loops, best of 3: 285 ns per loop
```
and the other ways of calling the timer still work:

```
sage: %time [1..10]
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
sage: timeit('[1..10]')
625 loops, best of 3: 127 Âµs per loop
```

Probably I should elaborate more on how it works.

In the old version of `preparse_ipython`, it was tested whether an input line starts with '%'. If this was the case, then the word after '%' was checked. If that word referred to an interface,  the interface was used. If the word after '%' was differently, the line was returned without a change.

For the new version, I suggest to test whether the word after '%' is 'timeit'. If it is, `preparse_ipython` returns `timeit.eval(..rest of the input line..)`.

Simon,

what do you think about the idea of using ipython to do this, like mhansen suggests above?  I think it's cleaner, it keeps the ipython stuff together (i.e., the "%" commands with ipython), and avoids making the preparser more complicated.
