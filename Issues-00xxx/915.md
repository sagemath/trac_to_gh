To quote William from linbox-use:

```
I would also like to know the answer to this.  In SAGE were currently do this
conversion by not using PID_Integer, and instead using an old header file
from an old version of Linbox that defined a GMP Integer wrapper type.
Fast conversion to/from mpz_t is critical for what we're doing.
```
Dave Saunders came up with the following suggestion:

```
PID_integer ZZ;
SparseMatrix<PID_integer> A (ZZ,m,m);  //defines empty sparse matrix

mpz_t x;
mpz_init_set_ui(x, 5);


// Assign x into A, avoiding conversions and double copy.
mpz_set ( SpyInteger::get_mpz(A.refEntry(1,2)), x);

ZZ.write(std::cout, A.getEntry(1,2)) << std::endl;

PS.  A more direct function could be desirable.
