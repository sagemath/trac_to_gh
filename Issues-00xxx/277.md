The computational cost of Shanks' Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm and Pollard's rho and lambda algorithms are more or less the same, but the memory costs is much worse for Shanks' algorithm.  It would be nice to have better discrete log algos and group structure computations, ala E. Teske, A Space Efficient Algorithm for Group Structure Computation (1998).

The attached patch (8758.patch) is a first stab at doing these things more generically.  For any multiplicative or additive situation the new version of discrete_log_generic() now works, using a baby-step-giant-step approach.  For example (see doctest) this gives a BSGS implementation of DLOGS for elliptic curves.

If people think this is a reasonable way to go (and it is certainly a simple interface) then there is more which can be added very easily:  a more general BSGS function (solve `a=b^n` with `n` in some specified interval) which would be called by discrete_log() and also allow for computation of orders of elements in any group, etc.

Then one could have other algorithms implemented in the same framework such as Pollard Rho or the more sophisticated ones mentioned in earlier comments.

More comments please!

I like it. 

One comment I have is that you might want to look at the python `operator` module rather than using lambda functions. 

```
sage: _ = var('x,y')
sage: operator.neg(x)
-x
sage: operator.add(x,y) # the order is actually respected, this is just a maxima thing
y + x
sage: operator.invert(x)
1/x
sage: operator.mul(x,y)
x*y
```
