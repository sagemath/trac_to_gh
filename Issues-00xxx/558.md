Hello folks,

```
for n in range(10,100): a=ModularSymbols(n,sign=1).decomposition(); print n, get_memory_usage()
```
causes (among other things) the following:

```

Some progress with the attached patch:

```
sage: d = [ZZ(i**100000 + 1) for i in range(100)]; del d
sage: get_memory_usage()
577.11328125
sage: sage.rings.integer.free_integer_pool()
sage: get_memory_usage()
570.2421875
```

but if the integers are smaller nothing seems to change

```
sage: d = [ZZ(i**10000 + 1) for i in range(100)]; del d
sage: get_memory_usage()
571.078125
sage: sage.rings.integer.free_integer_pool()
sage: get_memory_usage()
571.078125
```

free_integer_pool() is also called on exit() if the attached patch is applied.

This patch seriously breaks SAGE.  Try 

```
    sage -t --verbose coding/linear_code.py
```
on exit SAGE hangs with

```
*** glibc detected *** /home/was/s/local/bin/python: double free or corruption (out): 0x0000000002b75f70 ***
```

In the official version of SAGE, I'm commenting out the line in all.py that calls the cleanup until
this gets fixed.   Note that all the code mentioned above is in the offical repo, but calling
it is commented out.
