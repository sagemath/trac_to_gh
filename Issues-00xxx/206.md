If I add a bunch of graphics primitives to a Graphic object using the Graphic append() method, the `__xmax`, `__xmin`, `__ymax`, `__ymin` attributes are not updated. Therefore when I try to plot the graphic, nothing shows up. Code for the correct behaviour can be found in the `Graphic.__add__()` method.

The correct behaviour is not quite that in Graphic.__add__(), since this is adding two Graphics objects. The reason for this bug is that primitives don't usually remember their xmin/max values, and if they do it's inconsistent.

After a massive amount of discussion, we decided that there should be no Graphic.append method.  It just doesn't even make sense.   So we removed it and closed this bug.
