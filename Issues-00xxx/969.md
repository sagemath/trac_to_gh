You're right.  We added some doctests in test.py to specifically
test that all the convex optimization code really got built.
Evidently it didn't for you.  If you aren't doing convex optimization
(via cvxopt) this won't affect you. 

By the way, I am able to replicate exactly this problem on my powerpc mac test machine.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
NOTE -- this is definitely *not* fixed yet.  With my clean sage-2.8.9 install
on my 32-bit debian test machine this happens upon typing 

from cvxopt import solvers



Specifically there's a bug report about this from lwd8700 at yahoo in sage-support.
