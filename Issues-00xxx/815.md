Running sage -t on a `.sage` file incorrectly reports that all tests passed in the situation that a line of output is missing in the doctest. For example, the following text, in a .sage file, incorrectly produces "All tests passed!":

```

Thoughts:

```
was-815: That 815 thing is because I have a completely custom script for going through .sage files and extracting docstrings and testing as it goes.
[4:29pm] was-815: That seems dumb now.
[4:29pm] was-815: Much better would be to just doctest the corresponding autogenerated .py file.
[4:30pm] was-815: I.e., (1) generate the.py file, then (2) make sure it has "from a import *" in it (where a.sage is the sage file), then (3) do whatever we do to doctest
[4:30pm] was-815: a .py file.
[4:30pm] was-815: The only other thing is to make sure the line numbers match up.
[4:31pm] was-815: nick -- what do you think of my proposal for #815.
[4:31pm] was-815: Basically, I just want to make it reduce to the case of .py.

Lost of deleted code, a bit of modification and doctesting for .sage works as well as for the rest.

It's still of limited interest for files that are not part of the sage library, but at least it won't lie about the results anymore
