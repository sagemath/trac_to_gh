You may be right -- This sucks, and I'm annoyed I missed this.  I'm extremely
annoyed that Singular describes itself on their front page as: "SINGULAR is a free
software under the GNU General Public Licence.", since it's a misleading lie.
 
The discussion mentions two problems:
 
   * MP's license -- not a problem, since I delete MP from the Singular tarball, and
     SAGE doesn't use it.
 
   * OMalloc -- I don't know what it is, but its license is a *major* problem.
 
As the thread you link to says, maybe there is a chance we could get around using omalloc...
 
Ideas?  I don't know anything about the details of how it is used yet.

This sounds like if this is a problem for SAGE, or doesn't it?

Do you happen to know Bachmann? It wouldn't hurt to ask him if
he thinks it's an issue. In any case, this was already mentioned
(though vaguely) in SAGE's COPYING.txt file - that omalloc
has it's own copyright and license.
 
This is a major issue.  Certainly what we are doing is *not* illegal.
HOWEVER, it means that when we write:  "All components of SAGE are
licenesed under the GPL or a GPL compatible license (except jsmath
which is under the apache license), so *you* can modify anything
included in sage, make new releases, etc.", we are incorrect.
 
Either:
 
  (1) The author of omalloc changes the license, or
 
  (2) We remove the depenedency of singular on omalloc, or
 
  (3) We undertake the extremely painful task of removing singular
      from the core of SAGE (we'd switch to Macaulay2, which is "really"
      GPL'd).  Singular would remain as an optional package, since we
      make no claims about the licenses of optional packages.
 
A *crucial* aspect of SAGE is that anybody who downloads the core
tarball must be allowed to change any line of code in there, and make
new versions from the result.

Hi Wiliam,
sure, use and/or modify omalloc, no problem. @Singular team: I hereby ask
you to take away those special licensing restrictions of omalloc and to put
it under the same license as Singular.
