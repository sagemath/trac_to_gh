Why do you think MAGMA uses PARI for this?  (And this isn't so much
a problem with SAGE but with PARI....  Try the same computation
directly in PARI and it is just as slow.)
 
If you really want the answer to only 53-bits precision, by the way,
numpy can do it much much faster than MAGMA. For example,
 
sage: import numpy
sage: f = numpy.array([1,-11,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1]))
sage: numpy.roots(f)
sage: array([ 10.99172314+0.j        ,  -0.72174425+0.j        ,
         -0.45332013+0.53432014j,  -0.45332013-0.53432014j,
          0.66182264+0.30451078j,   0.66182264-0.30451078j,
          0.15650805+0.67766101j,   0.15650805-0.67766101j])
sage: time v=[numpy.roots(f) for _ in range(1000)]
CPU times: user 0.28 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.28 s
Wall time: 0.28
 
That's already about 5 times faster than MAGMA.  And I bet
that on larger degree numpy beats MAGMA by a lot more...
 
SAGE doesn't use numpy for root finding yet, partly because
numpy was added to SAGE only very recently, and I haven't
touched the root finding code in a while.
