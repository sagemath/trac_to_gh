Over a year ago there were some bugs reported by someone on the email lists regarding the implementation of the special functions.

Also, at someone's request (I think William Stein), a Bessel function class was created which implemented a few Bessel functions as class instances. 

All this is in the patch 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/special-functions.hg
It passed sage-t.
