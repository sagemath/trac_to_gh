Gonzalo brought up the following very good idea: one should rewrite the code for _sig_on and _sig_off to keep a counter of how many _sig_on calls it has seen, and run less than the full amount of code (i.e. nothing involving system calls) if we've already had a _sig_on. Then _sig_off can just decrement the counter, and only do the "real work" if it's being decremented to zero.
