If files a.sage and a.py exist in a directory, then 

sage: load a.sage

destroys the file a.py and replaces it with an automatically generated file.  Either users should be warned of this "feature" or something else should be done.

Is there any reason to put the .py files in the same directory? It would probably be less confusing to just put them in temp. If one wants to see them, one can use sage -preparse. 

I'm having trouble finding where exactly these files are getting written/used.
