Consider:

```
sage: P.<x,y>  = PolynomialRing(GF(2),2)
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.FieldIdeal(P)
sage: Q = P.quo(I)
sage: Q._singular_()

//   characteristic : 2

//                  : names    x y
//        block   2 : ordering C
// quotient ring from ideal
_[1]=x2+x
_[2]=y2+y
sage: Q(x)
xbar
sage: Q(x)._singular_()
