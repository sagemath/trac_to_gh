It's not nicely integrated into SAGE yet, but the capability is there
via Singular, which is included in SAGE.  For example:

sage: singular.load('reesclos.lib')
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: i = ideal([x^2,x*y^4,y^5])
sage: singular(i).normalI()         # the [1] part gives the normalization
[1]:
   _[1]=x^2
   _[2]=y^5
   _[3]=x*y^3

Very likely somebody will add this functionality to the next version of SAGE,
i.e., so you could type i.integral_closure(), and get back the ideal as a SAGE ideal.
