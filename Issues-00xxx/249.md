We could easily make Sage *twice* as fast at certain things
with an easy to implement optimization.  See below.  This is 
the sort of thing Robert Bradshaw or Nick Alexander could likely 
do in two hours, easily.  That Sage doesn't do this already is
a little surprising (it was because I didn't have time to
implement it).   Here is one simple example to illustrate my
point:

```
%time
for i in range(10^6):
    a = 2*3
CPU time: 0.79 s,  Wall time: 0.80 s


%time
two = 2; three = 3
for i in range(10^6):
    a = two*three
CPU time: 0.41 s,  Wall time: 0.42 s
```

It is unclear to me what the objective of this ticket is besides the fact that python types are potentially faster than certain Sage types like Integers. So: please elaborate or invalidate this ticket.
