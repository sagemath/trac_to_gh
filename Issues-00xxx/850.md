It would be very useful to be able to create a graph by giving a list of vertices and a function which specified the adjacencies.  See the doc examples in the patch for several examples.

I just noticed that the comment in the DiGraph `__init__` function should be changed from: 

                \# Pass XGraph a dict of lists describing the adjacencies
to
                \# Pass XDiGraph a dict of lists describing the adjacencies

Sorry.
