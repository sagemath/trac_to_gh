If you make a messy 3x3 matrix over QQ and raise it to a large power
in SAGE it takes WAY longer than in Mathematica. 


```
sage: time m = matrix(QQ,3,range(9)); m[0,0] =20; n=m^(-1)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.05
sage: time k=n^20000
CPU times: user 0.56 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.56 s
Wall time: 0.57
sage: nm = magma(n)
sage: time l=nm^20000
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.40
sage: nm = mathematica(n)
sage: time a=nm^20000
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.03
```

SAGE should do whatever mathematica is doing...
