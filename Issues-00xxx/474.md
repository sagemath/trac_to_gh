At the moment the valgrind tool and flags are hardcoded in various scripts. So add checks for environment flag SAGE_VALGRIND_FLAGS to overwrite default.

To illustrate what you can do with other tools from the valgrind suite have a look at the two attached graphs created by the heap profiler massif.

It might also be nice to add a -valgrind to "sage -testall" to valgrind the whole test suite.

For two examples look at:
