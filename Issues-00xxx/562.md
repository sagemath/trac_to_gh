Hello folks,

```
for n in range(10,100): a=ModularSymbols(n,sign=1).decomposition(); print n, get_memory_usage()
```
causes (among other things) the following:

Mmmh, it looks like a matrix over ZZ isn't properly deallocated in Sage's python code. I looked at all the path and the deallocation seems to work correctly. William did mention something about this in IRC a couple days ago.

I have to correct myself. Doing a 

```
sage: for I in range(1000):
....:     a = Matrix(ZZ,2,[1,2,3,4])
....:     del a
```
vs. 

```
sage: for I in range(1000):
....:     a = Matrix(ZZ,2,[1,2,3,4])
```
leads to identical numbers when valgrinding. My guess is that the leak must be somewhere in the Cython code when initializing a matrix filled with zeros without deallocating it.
