Either remove the dependency on curses, or make curses a standard sage package.  Test building on more architectures.

And, there should be some sort of voting on this in sage-devel by the people who would maintain it.

```
18:01 < sage> it's different.
18:01 < sage> getting it to build is different than moving it into standard.
18:01 < mabshoff> So we use ncurses for now, but once it becomes standard we should remove the dependency.
18:01 < sage> moving into standard presupposes removing dependencies, worrying about longterm quality and
              stability, etc.
