This is really a leftover from ticket #467, split because I wanted the first half of the fix to make it into 2.8.7. Here's a summary of the badness:

```
sage: x = 10^100000

sage: time y = pari(x)
CPU times: user 1.18 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.19 s
Wall time: 1.26

sage: time z = Integer(y)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.02

sage: time u = int(y)
CPU times: user 1.94 s, sys: 1.33 s, total: 3.27 s
Wall time: 3.58

sage: time u = int(Integer(y))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.03


sage: x = 10^1000000

sage: time y = pari(x)
CPU times: user 105.12 s, sys: 1.26 s, total: 106.38 s
Wall time: 121.86

sage: time z = Integer(y)
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.05 s
Wall time: 0.09

sage: time u = int(y)
CPU times: user 188.17 s, sys: 145.12 s, total: 333.28 s
Wall time: 364.80

sage: time u = int(Integer(y))
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.07
```

And here's the state of affairs after the first patch:

```
sage: x = 10^100000

sage: time y = pari(x)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00

sage: time z = Integer(y)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00

sage: time u = int(y)
CPU times: user 1.64 s, sys: 1.09 s, total: 2.73 s
Wall time: 2.79

sage: time u = int(Integer(y))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00

sage: x = 10^1000000

sage: time y = pari(x)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01

sage: time z = Integer(y)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00

sage: time u = int(y)
CPU times: user 220.90 s, sys: 137.34 s, total: 358.24 s
Wall time: 408.11

sage: time u = int(Integer(y))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01

```

Clearly that third function call needs to be fixed; this is done by the attached patch.

I am uploading a patch that implements conversion from PARI `t_INT` to Python long via an intermediate `mpz_t`, so `long(y)` essentially does `long(Integer(y))`.

Some timings:

Why not literally do `long(Integer(y))` then and save many lines of code?

I thought that the penalty for creating an `Integer` was quite heavy in some cases; for example, with the current patch applied, I get

```
sage: y=pari(10^10000)
sage: %timeit -c -r 1 u=long(y)
100000 loops, best of 1: 12.2 us per loop
sage: %timeit -c -r 1 u=long(Integer(y))
10000 loops, best of 1: 19.6 us per loop
```
However, I just tried implementing `gen.__long__(self)` as `return long(Integer(self))`, and it is just as fast, thanks to Cython I guess.  I also agree that `long(pari("Mod(2,7)"))` is nice to get for free.  New patch coming soon.
