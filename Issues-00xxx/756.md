One should slightly rewrite the derivative function for
polynomials (and power series) to take
an optional argument (the variable).  If the
innput variable is the same as the parent
gen, then differentiate as before; otherwise
attempt to call derivative on the coefficients -- if
that works, good; if not, return 0.

Few minor issues to sort out.

In the `polynomial_element_generic.py` version, some indentation has gone awry (the `if d.has_key(-1):` block is indented more than it used to be).

As a general rule please use `if x is None` instead of `if x == None`, because it's 100x faster:

```
sage: x = 5

sage: timeit if x is None: y = 6
1000000 loops, best of 3: 239 ns per loop

sage: timeit if x == None: y = 6
10000 loops, best of 3: 31.9 Âµs per loop
```

The phrase "if the latter is absent" is a bit confusing; the first time I read it I thought it meant "if the object being differentiated doesn't have the latter", which is completely wrong. Maybe something like "if no var is supplied"?
