But I'm somewhat
surprised, it's specified, in the "SAGE Installation Guide", that "The
directory where you built SAGE is NOT hardcoded into any part of SAGE."
but it's not possible to see the source code of a function if you moved
SAGE after the build. Same thing when an error is reported, for example:
 
===========================================================================
R = PolynomialRing(QQ)
factor(R)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
exceptions.TypeError                                 Traceback (most
recent call last)
 
/usr/local/sage-test/<ipython console> 
 
/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.py in
factor(n, proof, int_, algorithm, verbose)
 
TypeError: unable to factor n
 
============================================================================
but here, the path to sage is /usr/local/sage-test. Do I have to report
this as a bug ?

This is a known problem.  Fixing this is high on the list.  Probably
the solution will be just to check if the tree has moved on startup,
and if so to delete the 
    <SAGE_ROOT>/devel/sage/build 
directory.  Doing so should update the paths.
