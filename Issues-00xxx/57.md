The following calculation should be virtually instantaneous:

```
sage: x = 2**120000/3**100000
sage: K = pAdicField(5, 5)
sage: time y = K(x)
CPU times: user 2.72 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.72 s
Wall time: 2.72
```

It should take about as long as just reducing numerator and denominator separately:

```
sage: time z = K(x.numerator())
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00

sage: time z = K(x.denominator())
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
```
