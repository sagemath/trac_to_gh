What's happening is that f and g both wrap maxima objects and
when you multipy you get something that wraps a maxima object.
You can get the names of them and see that multiplying just gives
the name of the product.    The solution is for somebody (e.g., me)
to define arithmetic operations on maxima.function objects, i.e.,
adding to the MaximaFunction class in devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py.
Your problem is a NotImplementedError. 

The reason the answer is different at different times is that the
variables in maxima that SAGE uses are named consecutively. 

sage: f = maxima.function('x','sin(x)')
sage: g = f.integrate('x')
sage: f.name()
'sage0'
sage: g.name()
'sage2'
sage: f*g
sage0*sage2
sage: f
sin(x)
sage: g
-cos(x)
sage: f(10)
sin(10)
sage: f(10.)
-.5440211108893698
sage: (f*g)(10.0)
(sage0*sage2)[10.0]
sage: h = f*g
sage: h(10.0)
(sage0*sage2)[10.0]
```

Attachment: **[MaximaFunctionArith.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket132/MaximaFunctionArith.patch.gz)**

I am surprised that this old ticket was never closed.

I do not claim that i produced high-performance code. However, the following things are now possible:

```
sage: f=maxima.function('x','sin(x)')
sage: g=f.integrate('x')
sage: h=maxima.function('y','cos(y)')
sage: 2*f
2*sin(x)
sage: f*g
-cos(x)*sin(x)
sage: g*h
-cos(x)*cos(y)
sage: (g*h)(3,4)
-cos(3)*cos(4)
sage: (g-f)
-sin(x)-cos(x)
sage: g^f
(-cos(x))^sin(x)
sage: f^g
1/sin(x)^cos(x)
```

There remains the following problem (if it is a problem):

```
sage: f+x
sin(x)+x  # works
sage: 2+f
sin(x)+2  # works
sage: x+f
x + sage0 # doesn't work!
```
This is -- i guess -- due to automatic coercion: `x+f` is the same as 

```
sage: x+x.parent()(f)
x + sage0
```
while `f+x` is the same as

```
sage: f+f.parent()(x)
sin(x)+x
```

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

1. I forgot to include doc tests. This is done with the follow-up patch (to be applied after the first).

   2. Also, there was a problem with the order of arguments:

```
sage: a=maxima.function('x,y','cos(y)+sin(x)')
sage: b=maxima.function('x,y','cos(y)-cos(x)')
sage: (a+b)(2,3)
sin(3)-cos(3)+2*cos(2)
```
 Hence, in `(a+b)`, `x` is the second (not the first) argument.

 The methods from the second patch order the arguments lexicographically. I think this is the most natural solution:

```
sage: a=maxima.function('x,y','cos(y)+sin(x)')
sage: b=maxima.function('x,y','cos(y)-cos(x)')
sage: (a+b)(2,3)
2*cos(3)+sin(2)-cos(2)
```

3. A method `__rpow__` is now also in the second patch.

```
sage: f=maxima.function('x','sin(x)')
sage: g=maxima('-cos(x)') # not a function
sage: g^f
(-cos(x))^sin(x)
sage: _(2)
(-cos(2))^sin(2)
```
