It seems much has changed since polymake v 2.2, so this might be difficult.
Also, they have interactive scripts, which one has to deal with.  Yuck.

I did try just building from scratch and it seemed to work without any funny
business with GMP, etc. 

If you work on this, email wstein@gmail.com

Ok, I did some investigation. We need to modify support/configure.pl:

Around line 273:

```
$InstallTop ||= $multi ? "/usr/local/share/polymake" : "/usr/local/polymake";
if (!$silent) {
   print "\nWhere should ", ($multi ? "the architecture-independent part of " : ""), "polymake be installed? ";
   answer_path($InstallTop);
}
```
Instead of answer_path($InstallTop) we just should assign $InstallTop=getenv($SAGE_LOCAL) (or something alike, my perl is slightly rusty).

We also need to add Sage's gmp to $Libs around line 614 somewhere.

Cheers,

Michael

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

I created packages for a prerelease version of polymake before this workshop:

http://polymake.org/doku.php/workshop0311

The package and its dependencies are here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/polymake/

These packages were just for convenience. They are not ready for review. :)

I also started writing a python wrapper to libPolymake. It's not useful for anything yet, but I could make it useful and release it if there is interest.

There has definitely been interest in this from various people I've spoken to over the years.  Also, it would be good to have it be an optional spkg for this.  Note the current version is now 2.12 (Burcin's was 2.9).
