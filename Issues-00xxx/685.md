The eisenstein_series_qexp function currently only handles eisenstein series for level 1. It wouldn't be hard to make this handle eisenstein series for higher level and with character. I'm going to take care of this soon, but this is here in case I forget. ;)

Do we want any more functionality than in the following example?

```
sage: G=DirichletGroup(4)
sage: chi=G[1]
sage: E=EisensteinForms(chi,1)
sage: f=E.eisenstein_series()[0]
sage: f.q_expansion(40)

```
If not, maybe we can close this as fixed/wontfix/whatever_is_appropriate.
