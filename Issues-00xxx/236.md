I can reproduce the problem, but the error message has changed:

```
load "hello.spyx"
Error loading /tmp/Work2/sage-2.8.1/sage-2.8.1/hello.spyx -- file not
found
```

The spyx file can actually be found in $SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/sage/hello.spyx

This bug also seems to be duplicate of #230.

Cheers,

Michael
