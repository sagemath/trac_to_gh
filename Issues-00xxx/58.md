I would like to be able to type

```
sage: X = Set(range(5))
sage: X.subsets()  # or X.powerset()
```
and get iterator over the power set.  

I wold also like to do 

```
sage: X.subsets(2)
```
and get all 2-element subsets.

It seems that even Python's built-in set type doesn't do these basic operations...
