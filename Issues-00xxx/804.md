Hi,

At first glance, I thought this ticket would help to build tropical matrices as discussed in #14507... but no, the "base ring" for tropical matrix is a [semiring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring) and not a ring (no requirement of an additive inverse). Am I right?

Looks good to me. I also think that tropical matrices should have their own classes.

My copy did not compile against 6.3.beta3 but was probably more an issue with the beta since it failed before attempting to build the sage library. With 6.3.beta5 it works like a charm.
