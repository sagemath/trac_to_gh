Hi,

At first glance, I thought this ticket would help to build tropical matrices as discussed in #14507... but no, the "base ring" for tropical matrix is a [semiring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring) and not a ring (no requirement of an additive inverse). Am I right?

Looks good to me. I also think that tropical matrices should have their own classes.
