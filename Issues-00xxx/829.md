The new edit() command in SAGE forces the chosen editor into the background.  I'm not sure of the ramifications, but I have a change to the command that does the following: if DISPLAY is set in the user's environment, the assumption is that the editor will work with X (the window system).  Since the default 'emacs' in Mac OS X does not work with X, the result is that edit() terminates prematurely, complaining that standard output is not a tty.

My fix is to retain the current behavior only if DISPLAY is set.  Otherwise, the editor command is invoked as a "foreground" task, not a background task.
