```
The following takes a very long time, possibly forever (I waited several minutes before giving up and killing it):

```
sage:  MR.<x,w,v,u> = QQ['x','w','v','u']
sage:  p = (4*v^4*u^2 - 16*v^2*u^4 + 16*u^6 - 4*v^4*u + 8*v^2*u^3 + v^4)
sage:  %time p.factor()
```

Similarly, if you run sage -singular, the equivalent code fails again:

```
> ring r = 0,(x,w,v,u),dp;
> factorize(4*v^4*u^2 - 16*v^2*u^4 + 16*u^6 - 4*v^4*u + 8*v^2*u^3 + v^4);
```

However, if I build my own copy of Singular from the source on the Singular website, or if I download and install the Debian binary package from the Singular website, then this second factorization completes instantly.

Component: **commutative algebra**

I'm not sure what to make of this, but...

```
sage: MR.<x,w,v,u> = GF(20011)['x','w','v','u']
sage: p = (4*v^4*u^2 - 16*v^2*u^4 + 16*u^6 - 4*v^4*u + 8*v^2*u^3 + v^4)
sage: time h = p.factor ()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
```

```
14:47 < williamstein> cwitty -- I wonder if we could implement polynomial gcd and factoring
                      directly in sage based on
14:47 < williamstein> singular's excellent GF(p) factorization.
14:47 < williamstein> E.g., your example is trivial to factor instantly in sage mod p for any p.
14:48 < williamstein> It seems like Singular is really really good at mod-p factoring and gcd, and
14:48 < williamstein> seriously problematic at char 0 factoring (and maybe gcd?)

I'm attaching a patch to the Singular spkg that fixes this bug.  Basically, we didn't manage to tell Singular that it had NTL available, so there were several places where it used non-NTL code paths (that were evidently buggy) instead of the working NTL code paths.  This may also explain why the upstream Singular binaries are faster than the ones we build.

You will need to do "sage -ba" after installing the new Singular spkg.

Part of my patch reverts changeset 15:e085dde558b2 in the spkg repository; this is labeled "fixed build for OSX", so presumably my patch breaks the build for OSX.  I don't have access to an OSX machine (or time) to figure this out.
