<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I'm guessing this is caused by the following lines from expect.py...

```
# . in user's path causes *HUGE* trouble, e.g., pexpect will try to
# run a directory name!
p = os.environ['PATH'].split(':')
os.environ['PATH'] = ':'.join([v for v in p if v.strip() != '.'])
```

These lines were added by William Stein:

summary:     Make sure . is not in user's path.
