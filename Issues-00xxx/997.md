A command like

```
find . -type f | xargs touch
```
which will touch all files (without spaces) in all subdirectories
may be useful.

Sorry this ticket is somewhat vague.  The point is mainly that
"sage -br" causes rebuilding everything too often, e.g., after
extracting a binary, or always if your machine has a huge clock skew, e..g, if your machine things it is a few days before the
timestamps on a release that you just downloaded or installed.

[08:19] <mabshoff> wstein: didn't you do something like #997?
[08:19] <wstein> yes, but I had to revert what I did do, which was really dumb.
[08:19] <wstein> You can close that as invalid.
```
