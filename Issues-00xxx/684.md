<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This isn't a bug, it's a lack of something that would be nice being implemented (because we never got to it).

It's easy to do this:

```
sage: Integer(repr(ntl.ZZ_random(1000)))
937
```

However, that uses base 10 strings.   It would be much better to get at the underlying
NTL pointer to some GMP data.  I have no clue how to do that.

This seems to work now:

```
mabshoff@sage:~$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.7, Release Date: 2007-10-15                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: x = ntl.ZZ(5)
sage: x
5
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZ.ntl_ZZ'>
sage: Integer(x)
5
```
Should it be closed?

Cheers,

Michael
