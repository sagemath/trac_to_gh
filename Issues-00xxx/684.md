This isn't a bug, it's a lack of something that would be nice being implemented (because we never got to it).

It's easy to do this:

```
sage: Integer(repr(ntl.ZZ_random(1000)))
937
```

However, that uses base 10 strings.   It would be much better to get at the underlying
NTL pointer to some GMP data.  I have no clue how to do that.

sage: x = ntl.ZZ(5)
sage: x

Should it be closed?
