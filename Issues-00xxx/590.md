The rings/extended_rational_field.py file is terribly documented.  There are no doctests, no copyright notice, no author, etc.   I think David Roe wrote this:

I'm mostly happy with this patch; I have a few questions.

* What is `IntegerWrapper`? That's been added with no explanation at all, and I don't understand its purpose. Is it really necessary? If so, there needs to be some documentation.

* regarding `coerce_map_from_impl` and `Q_to_ExtendedQ`: I don't understand the coercion framework any more, so I can't vouch for correctness of the implementations. I'd like someone who understands coercion to take a quick look. Mike, if you find someone on IRC who can sign off on these, that's fine. One thing that bothers me slightly is:

```
sage: ExtendedRationalField.coerce_map_from_impl(ExtendedIntegerRing)
[boom]
```

* docstring for `ExtendedRational.__init__` is a little confusing; "The class of extended rational numbers" is a little confusing, sounds like "The set of extended rational numbers". Perhaps better something like "Constructor for elements of the extended rational field".

* `_mul_`: I'd like to see examples of multiplying infinity by infinity and minus infinity

I have various other complaints about this module, but it's not in the new code you've written and I don't want to hold up this patch, so I won't go into them now.
