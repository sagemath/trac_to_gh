The following behaviour, while strictly speaking not incorrect, is quite confusing:

```
sage: K = pAdicField(5, series_print=False)
sage:  K(37, prec=1)
 5^0 * (37 + O(5^1))
```

Really, it should be reducing 37 mod 5 when you do the conversion, or at the very least when you print it out, otherwise you don't realise that 37 + O(5) and 7 + O(5) are really the same thing. (This caused me a few hours of head-scratching today because I thought that two things didn't agree when actually they did.)

If you use the default series_print=True, then this doesn't happen:

```
sage: K = pAdicField(5)
sage:  K(37, prec=1)
 2 + O(5)
```
