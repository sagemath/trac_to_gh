Example:

```
%form

Enter an integer n=300
Enter a prime p=2
Show prime factors only primes=False
Operate on primes op=
  * sum
  * product

{{{
  v = factor(n%p)
  if primes:
    for i in v:
      print i[0]
  else:
    for i in v:
      print "%d**%d"%i
  if op == "sum"
    print "Sum of prime factors"
    s = 0
    for i in v:
      s += i[0]*i[1]
    print s
  if op == "product"
    print "Product of distinct prime factors"
    s = 1
    for i in v:
      s *= i[0]
    print s
}}}

```

The above would make an interactive widget which would make an input form for the variables used in the code block.  A submit button would read the input fields and display output from the code.
