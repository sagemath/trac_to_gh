In sage-2.0 and sage-2.1.0.1 the first Axiom command that I enter
hangs the sage process but if I hit control-c and re-enter the
command, it works as it used to work. This also affects Axiom
commands entered via the notebook.
 
  sage: axiom('1+1')
  ... waits indefinitely ...
  ^C
  ...
  sage: axiom('1+1')

---------------
 
I will take a look at the axiom inteface code when I get time
but perhaps someone already knows what might have changed in
the way the interface works?
 
BTW, I am using the axiom4sage-0.1 download from sage.math but
I had a problem with the simple
 
  sage -I axiom4sage-0.1.spkg
 
command. I apparently received only a partial download and the
install failed. Later, I downloaded axiom4sage-0.1.spkg directly
to the sage root directory and repeated the command:
 
  sage -I axiom4sage-0.1.spkg
 
Then Axiom was built and installed as expected on my OpenSuSE 10.2
x86 linux system.
 
Regards,
Bill Page.
