In sage-2.0 and sage-2.1.0.1 the first Axiom command that I enter
hangs the sage process but if I hit control-c and re-enter the
command, it works as it used to work. This also affects Axiom
commands entered via the notebook.
 
  sage: axiom('1+1')
  ... waits indefinitely ...
  ^C
  ...
  sage: axiom('1+1')

---------------
 
I will take a look at the axiom inteface code when I get time
but perhaps someone already knows what might have changed in
the way the interface works?
 
BTW, I am using the axiom4sage-0.1 download from sage.math but
I had a problem with the simple
 
  sage -I axiom4sage-0.1.spkg
 
command. I apparently received only a partial download and the
install failed. Later, I downloaded axiom4sage-0.1.spkg directly
to the sage root directory and repeated the command:
 
  sage -I axiom4sage-0.1.spkg
 
Then Axiom was built and installed as expected on my OpenSuSE 10.2
x86 linux system.
 
Regards,
Bill Page.

Can somebody test if this is still the case? The bug report is rather stale and the current optional axiom4sage.spkg is around version number 0.3.

Cheers,
