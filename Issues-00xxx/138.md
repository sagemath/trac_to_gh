There seems to be a problem with the SAGE reference manual (at least the one that is on the web).

When I go to:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/SAGE/doc/html/ref/index.html

And click on, for example, the link called "Matrices and Spaces of Matrices", I am brought instead to the root page for "Algebras":
http://sage.math.washington.edu/SAGE/doc/html/ref/node214.html

Clicking on other links results in arriving at similarly undersired pages.
