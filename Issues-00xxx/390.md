There is a bug in the Cremona tables -- he actually missed some
curves, and I think that is one of them.  I need to update the
SAGE cremona table to match the latest official version of the tables.
I meant to do this but just haven't had the time.

 There is a bug in the Cremona tables -- he actually missed some
 curves, and I think that is one of them.  I need to update the
