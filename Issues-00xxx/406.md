I am aware of each of these issues (which also happen with
the other interfaces).  They are *not* features in my mind, but
bugs, and they need to be fixed by somebody (either me or
somebody else).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Trac #406:

1. Fix the problem where hitting tab when switched into another worksheet
   mode sticks system. at the front of each completion.  Similar fixes 
   for help via foo([tab key}] and source code via foo??[tab]. 

2. When switching systems, get rid of the very annoying 
   confirmation dialog.   (Just commented it out for now.)

3. Fix *very serious* bug that prevented loading a worksheet that was set
   to an optional mode.   In sage-3.0.1 loading a worksheet that is in
   an optional mode (e.g., mathematica or maple or Magma, say) was
   completely broken.  This patch fixes that problem. 

NOTE: This patch has no new tests illustrating that ift fixes
anything, since we have no automated way of testing any of the
above right now.
