merge working directory with another revision

    Merge the contents of the current working directory and the
    requested revision. Files that changed between either parent are
    marked as changed for the next commit and a commit must be
    performed before any further updates are allowed.

    If no revision is specified, the working directory's parent is a
    head revision, and the repository contains exactly one other head,
    the other head is merged with by default.  Otherwise, an explicit
    revision to merge with must be provided.

options:

 -f --force  force a merge with outstanding changes
 -r --rev    revision to merge
