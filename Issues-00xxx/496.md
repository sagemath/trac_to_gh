* In rings/arith.py the code for generic powering does an extra multiply the last time through the loop.
This can take a huge amount of extra time on big powering.

* In structure/element.pyx the code for generic n*x (the function cdef ModuleElement _lmul_c_impl(self, RingElement right), around line 1125) does possibly an extra add.


To fix this either rewrite or refactor the above code to be more like the __pow__ that is around
line 1057 of element.pyx.  Also, write *lots of doctests* to make sure you're really computing
the right thing.

Hello,

I think that bugs should only be closed as fixed once the patch has made it into the Repo. While this might be the case at least to the outside world this changeset is not visible yet. So I would suggest adding in Action an option "fix attached" to the resolve option.

Cheers,

Michael
