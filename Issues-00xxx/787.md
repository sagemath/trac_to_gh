If V is a subspace of W then W.quotient(V) should give the quotient space U=W/V.

Left TODO:
- overload "/" constructor ?
- provide a section map U->W ?
- install appropriate coercions ?

What? and ditch my 2 lines of haiku-like sage code?

Seriously, though. The attached patch contains quite a bit more than
"quotient", as you are probably woefully aware of. Easiest is probably

 - apply the patch
 - delete "quotient" from sage/modules/free_module.py

Cheers,
```

<a id='comment:15'>**Comment 15:**</a>
A quick comment.  Even as is this is WRONG -- the algorithm used is buggy, evidently, or something, since

```
sage: A = QQ^3; V = A.span([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
sage: Q = V.quotient( V.span([V.0 + V.1]) ); Q
sage: Q[1](V.0 + V.1)
(1)
```

But Q[1] is the quotient map so should have `V.0 + V.1` in its kernel.
