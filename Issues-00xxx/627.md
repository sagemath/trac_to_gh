pari needs a single line patch to build properly on 32 bit PPC Linux so that the linker doesn't throw a fit. Aside from trivial DSage that makes all doctests pass on that platform and elevates it to a fully supported platform.

The obvious next step is to get Sage to also build in 64 bit mode.

A patch will be attached to this ticket in the next 12 hours.

Cheers,

Michael

I made a couple of cosmetic changes to this patch to make pari-2.3.2.p3.spkg, which is available
at sagemath.org at patches/standard:

1. mv get_dlcflags into patches/
2. apply get_tdlcflags at build time
3. put the original get_dlcflags back in src/config, since src/ is supposed to be 100% plain vanilla sources.
4. did "hg ci" which was forgotten.
