The `RealNumber.nth_root()` function (new patch, not yet committed) is very slow when the index is large, e.g.

```
sage: x = RealNumber(8)

sage: time x.nth_root(100000)
CPU times: user 1.97 s, sys: 0.14 s, total: 2.11 s
Wall time: 2.11
 1.00002079463162
```

Seems to be caused by `mpfr_root()` itself; probably needs to be discussed upstream with the mpfr developers.

Any volunteers for this? Maybe it should be checked out if mpfr 2.3.0 still has the problem.

Cheers,

This is still a problem with Sage 2.8.4.2 + mpfr 2.3:

```
sage: x = RealNumber(8)
sage: time x.nth_root(100)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00
1.02101212570719
