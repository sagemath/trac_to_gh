The `RealNumber.nth_root()` function (new patch, not yet committed) is very slow when the index is large, e.g.

```
sage: x = RealNumber(8)

sage: time x.nth_root(100000)
CPU times: user 1.97 s, sys: 0.14 s, total: 2.11 s
Wall time: 2.11
 1.00002079463162
```

Seems to be caused by `mpfr_root()` itself; probably needs to be discussed upstream with the mpfr developers.

Any volunteers for this? Maybe it should be checked out if mpfr 2.3.0 still has the problem.

This is still a problem with Sage 2.8.4.2 + mpfr 2.3:

sage: x = RealNumber(8)

I've attached a patch for nth_root that uses a different algorithm for the cases that were slow before.  Now we get:

```
sage: x = RR(8)
sage: timeit x.nth_root(10)
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(100)
1000 loops, best of 3: 207 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 461 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(10000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 461 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(100000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 462 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(1000000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 456 µs per loop
sage: timeit x.nth_root(10000000)
