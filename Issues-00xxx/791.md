# Issue 791: ugly absprec parameter in Polynomial constructor

I'm not happy with the profusion of code to deal with the absprec parameter in Polynomial-related code (for example, search for the string "absprec" in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx).

Looks good.  I have rebased the patch against 3.3.alpha2, since it got entangled in the whole Sage Days 12 flurry of activity.
