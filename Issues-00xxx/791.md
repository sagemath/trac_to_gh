I'm not happy with the profusion of code to deal with the absprec parameter in Polynomial-related code (for example, search for the string "absprec" in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx). Something feels wrong with this design; the code keeps splitting into branches to deal with "absprec" or "no absprec" cases. I believe the "absprec" parameter has something to do with polynomials over p-adics. There has to be a cleaner way to deal with this issue. Please add comments below.
