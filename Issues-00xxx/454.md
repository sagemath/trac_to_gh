To see some VERY SEVERE memory leaks, probably in linear algebra -- exposed by modular symbols functionality do the following
(anything leaks -- 501 or something smaller or bigger.)

```
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
159.16015625
185.04296875
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
185.04296875
190.796875
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
190.796875
195.05859375
```

Valgrind tells us:

```
==14358== LEAK SUMMARY:
==14358==    definitely lost: 3,297,622 bytes in 194,267 blocks.
==14358==    indirectly lost: 703,345 bytes in 4,603 blocks.

Hello William,

I did valgrind that exact example three times in a row in the same sage session and I got:

==14358== LEAK SUMMARY:
==14358==    definitely lost: 3,297,622 bytes in 194,267 blocks.
==14358==    indirectly lost: 703,345 bytes in 4,603 blocks.
==14358==      possibly lost: 387,022 bytes in 984 blocks.
==14358==    still reachable: 153,105,982 bytes in 1,028,503 blocks.
==14358==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.

The complete log is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/sage-2.8.1-ticket-454.valgrind

Just search for "indirectly" and "definitely" to see the most interesting bits. Problems are all over the map: sparse & dense matricies, gmp allocations, LinBox Wrapper and so.

Let me know if you need any help.

I changed the Milestone to 2.8.2 - feel free to assign it to 3.0 if you feel that the 2.8.2 release cuts it too close.

Cheers,

Michael

Ok,

various bits and pieces have been broken out into different tickets and fixed. We should revisit this ticket during Bug Day 2 and see what is left.

Closed in Sage 2.10.4.alpha0

Since #2524 has been merged this is in effect fixed. #2525 does fix some other issues, but not the memory leak that is the last one left.

Many people have contributed to fixing this ticket over a seven month period:

* Michael Abshoff
* Martin Albrecht
* Burcin Erocal
* Willem Jan Palenstijn
* Clement Pernet
* William Stein 

It is good to have reached the end of this journey.
