To see some VERY SEVERE memory leaks, probably in linear algebra -- exposed by modular symbols functionality do the following
(anything leaks -- 501 or something smaller or bigger.)

```
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
159.16015625
185.04296875
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
185.04296875
190.796875
sage: get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
190.796875
195.05859375
```

Valgrind tells us:

```

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello William,

I did valgrind that exact example three times in a row in the same sage session and I got:

==14358== LEAK SUMMARY:
==14358==    definitely lost: 3,297,622 bytes in 194,267 blocks.
==14358==    indirectly lost: 703,345 bytes in 4,603 blocks.

==14358==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.

The complete log is at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/sage-2.8.1-ticket-454.valgrind

Just search for "indirectly" and "definitely" to see the most interesting bits. Problems are all over the map: sparse & dense matricies, gmp allocations, LinBox Wrapper and so.

Let me know if you need any help.

I changed the Milestone to 2.8.2 - feel free to assign it to 3.0 if you feel that the 2.8.2 release cuts it too close.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:13'></a>Closed in Sage 2.10.4.alpha0

Since #2524 has been merged this is in effect fixed. #2525 does fix some other issues, but not the memory leak that is the last one left.

Many people have contributed to fixing this ticket over a seven month period:

* Michael Abshoff
* Martin Albrecht
* Burcin Erocal
* Willem Jan Palenstijn
* Clement Pernet
* William Stein 

It is good to have reached the end of this journey.

Cheers,

Michael
