The following should work and define a homomorphism.
I don't remember actually implementing finite field homomorphisms, so it's
no surprise they don't just magically work.  This is very useful though, so
it needs to get done. 

```
k = GF(73^2,'a')
f = k.modulus()
r = f.change_ring(k).roots()
k.hom([r[0][0]])
