[12:25] <william> interesting feature idea:
[12:25] <william> extend the "sage -upgrade" command so you an give the directory or URL
[12:26] <william> of any other installed version of SAGE, and it will pull everything from there.
[12:26] <william> install any newer spkg's and pull from any active repo.
[12:26] <malb> definitely nice for sysadmins I guess

As William pointed out in IRC one can downgrade in which case a whole set of spkgs will be downloaded and then nothing is installed, but I am fine with that behavior. That might be fixed via some future ticket, but I don't think we should support downgrading.
