[12:25] <william> interesting feature idea:
[12:25] <william> extend the "sage -upgrade" command so you an give the directory or URL
[12:26] <william> of any other installed version of SAGE, and it will pull everything from there.
[12:26] <william> install any newer spkg's and pull from any active repo.

The three patches listed above look good to me. 

As William pointed out in IRC one can downgrade in which case a whole set of spkgs will be downloaded and then nothing is installed, but I am fine with that behavior. That might be fixed via some future ticket, but I don't think we should support downgrading. 

Cheers,

Michael
