PolyBoRi is a framework for doing computation within the boolean ring, i.e. the ring

```
F_2[x_1,...,x_n]/<x_1^2+x_1,x_n^2+x_n>
```
From the benchmarks presented in http://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/zentral/download/berichte/bericht122.pdf it not only features very fast arithmetic in that ring but also a very fast Gröbner basis engine. PolyBoRi is GPL'd and should be wrapped for SAGE.

Alexander Dreyer did comment on the build time of PolyBoRi:

```
The essential part of PolyBoRi (using the built-ininterface) can be
built in about 3 minutes on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU5148  @ 2.33GHz
(using one cpu only). I'll try to find the corresponding scons
commands for the spkg and the Sage-wrapper and give to to Burcin.

Best regards,

There is a new PolyBoRi package available at:

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/berocal/sage/polybori-0.1-r3.spkg

Changes are:
        - Alexander's changes to speed up the build process
        - Update to the latest CVS version
        - pass on MAKEOPTS to scons to allow parallel builds

Building the package takes 4 mins 20 seconds on a single Intel(R)
Pentium (R) D CPU 3.40GHz. Parallel make options (-jn) speed up the
build as expected.

Okay, I have stuck 

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/berocal/sage/polybori-0.1-r3.spkg

into 2.9.alpha2. Burcin, please send me a patch/bundle against some 2.9 release for the code that does the actual integrations with Sage.
