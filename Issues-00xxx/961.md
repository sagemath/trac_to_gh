Hello,

I am not sure if this qualifies as a bug, but by storing the list in ~/.sage the following should work even if the user doesn't have write permission below $SAGE_LOCAL:

```
mabshoff@sage:/tmp/Work-mabshoff/sage-2.8.8$ sage -standard
Using SAGE Server http://www.sagemath.org//packages
http://www.sagemath.org//packages/standard/list --> /home/was/s/tmp/list
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/was/s/tmp/list'



********************************************************************************



Error contacting http://www.sagemath.org//packages/standard/list. Try using an alternative server.
For example, from the bash prompt try typing

   export SAGE_SERVER=http://sage.scipy.org/sage/

then try again.



********************************************************************************
```
Cheers,

Michael

The same applies for -optional, -experimental and so on. This ought to be fixed since it has been hit a bunch of times by various people.
