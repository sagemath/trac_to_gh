Do some standard python trickier so that the sloane sequence objects are not created until they are used.   According to this, just importing sloane_sequences.py is now a nontrivial part of the SAGE startup time, which is ridiculous:

```

        1    0.027    0.027    0.049    0.049 sloane_functions.py:42(<module>)
```

Of course, the sloane_functions.py module needs to be broken up a lot.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Fixed for 2.1.5.  Sloane now computes and caches trait_names() and `__getattribute__` to pull SloaneSequence objects starting with 'A' from sage.combinat.sloane_functions.
