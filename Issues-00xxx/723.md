Magma's LLL is... way way way faster than the one in NTL.  E.g., (this requires patch #325)

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,200)
sage: time b=a.lll()
CPU times: user 8.74 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 8.83 s
Wall time: 8.85

sage: m = magma(a)
sage: time c=m.LLL()
Wall time: 1.02

sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,400)
sage: time b=a.lll()
CPU times: user 202.89 s, sys: 1.54 s, total: 204.44 s
Wall time: 206.16
sage: time c=magma(a)
CPU times: user 0.24 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.38
sage: time d=c.LLL()
Wall time: 13.23


```

It would also be good to benchmark PARI's LLL and compare.
Make sure to use the 1 option, so it knows the matrix is integral:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,100)
sage: time b=a.lll()
CPU times: user 0.53 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.53 s
Wall time: 0.53
sage: c = pari(a)
sage: time d=c.qflll(1)
CPU times: user 0.47 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.47 s
Wall time: 0.47
sage: a = random_matrix(ZZ,200)
sage: time b=a.lll()
CPU times: user 9.02 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 9.08 s
Wall time: 9.14
sage: c = pari(a)
sage: time d=c.qflll(1)
CPU times: user 9.88 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 9.93 s
Wall time: 9.95
```

Since LLL and LLLGram in Magma V2.13 are written by Damien Stehle,
using his asymptotically better algorithm.  The previous version was
not
even mathematically correct (adhoc "improvements" or post-processing
could destroy the LLL reduction condition).

Damien provides C code under GPL and can be found on his web page:

http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.stehle/english.html

It might take some art to decide on optimal parameters, but linking it
into
SAGE should provide the same asymptotic performance as in Magma.

The attached patch exposes NTL's floating point LLL implementations which are significantly faster than the exact one. However, these are approximates only.

fpLLL as mentioned above is patched into SAGE by the patch found at

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/fplll.patch

. Using this code, we can achieve a quite good performance.

```
sage:  = MatrixSpace(IntegerRing(), 50, 51)(0)
sage: for i in range(50): B[i,0] = ZZ.random_element(2**10000)

sage: for i in range(50): B[i,i+1] = 1
....:
sage: time C = B.LLL('fpLLL:fast')
CPU times: user 9.54 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 9.54 s
Wall time: 9.56

sage: C.is_LLL_reduced()
True

sage: BM = B._magma_()
sage: time CM = BM.LLL()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 15.20

sage: time magma.eval("CM := LLL(%s:Fast:=1)"%BM.name())
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
