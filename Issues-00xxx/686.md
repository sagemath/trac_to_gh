My guess would be Sage 3.1.2.alpha2. A lot of fixes in that area went into 3.1.2.X:

There is a 3.1.2.alph2 binary for sage.math in the "usual place".

This applies to 3.1.3.alpha1 with one tiny reject in libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi which is easily fixed (it just removes the newline at the end of the file).

I have two small objections, which are however too minor to keep this from being merged (hence the positive review):

* looking at the revised doctests, it seems that the way polynomials are now printed is slightly uglier than before: e.g. (g)*b!^2 instead of g*b!^2.  I don't know how hard this would be to fix, or even whether it would be desirable
* a few places in the docstrings have SAGE instead of Sage; we really ought to pick one (and AFAIK this has been done) and stick with it.

The agreed upon spelling these days is Sage. The problem with malb's patch is that there is no TeX macro, so as is the documentation fails to build. But I will just add the `\Sage` macro to `commontex/macros-new.tex` so that this issue is gone once and for all.

Hi malb,

when I merge this patch the sr.py doctest goes from 650 to over 1100 seconds:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha2$ ./sage -t -long devel//sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
         [1116.7 s]
```
We do not seem to add any doctests to sr.py. Do you still want me to merge it? I also have #4021 and #4022 ready to merge, but since they depend on this patch I am holding off on your decision.

Cheers,

Michael
