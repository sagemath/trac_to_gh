1. Create a script test.sage with this 1 line

```
solve([x==1], x)
```

2. Run it like so:

```
  $ sage test.sage
  Exception exceptions.AttributeError: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ExceptionPexpect'" in  ignored
```

3. If you put instead

```
print solve([x==1], x)
```
then everything works fine.

Clearly there is a bug there, probably with quitting the pexpect interface to maxima.

[09:59] <janwil> yes, it's a mystery to me right now ...
