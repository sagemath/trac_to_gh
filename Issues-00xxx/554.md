Consider this below -- the output doesn't make any sense at all:

```
sage: var('x')
sage: f = x^(1/9) + (2^(8/9) - 2^(1/9))*(x - 1) - x^(8/9)
sage: f
(2^(8/9) - 2^(1/9))*(x - 1) - x^(8/9) + x^(1/9)
sage: f.roots()
[((x^(8/9) - x^(1/9) + 2^(8/9) - 2^(1/9))/(2^(8/9) - 2^(1/9)), 1)]
```


Component: **calculus**
