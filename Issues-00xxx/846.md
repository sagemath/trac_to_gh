[7:41pm] mabshoff: mmmh
[7:41pm] mabshoff: So I don't need the reviewer patch I assume.
[7:41pm] cwitty: You need the half of it that creates an __init__.py file; probably not the half that patches integer.pyx .
[7:44pm] mabshoff: mk
[7:45pm] mabshoff: I assume that is lost in RobertWB's patch since hg screws up the empty file creation as usual.
[7:45pm] mabshoff: I will copy and paste the last couple lines to the ticket and then merge it.
