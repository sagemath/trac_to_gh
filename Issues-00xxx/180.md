[justin]: Hmmm...it's actually "-s -i".  The 'sage' command seems to care about the order of switches; "-f -i" works, while "-i -f" doesn't.  "-i -s" does not save the results, while '-s -i' does.  Is that intentional?

Hmmm again: 
$ sage -s -i gd-2.0.33.p1
Unknown option: -s
usage: sage [options]
Try 'sage -h' for more information.

Works when used as "sage -f -s -i gd-2.0.33.p1"
