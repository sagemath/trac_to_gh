```
when creating an animated gif on a system without imagemagick installed, the animate() command  just outputs

"sh: convert: not found"

instead of a more helpful error message (such as, "please install imagemagick")

I'm attaching a patch; it depends on #4216.

With this patch, if 'convert' is not found, I get an error message like this:

```
/usr/local/share/sage/local/bin/sage-native-execute: 8: convert: not
found

Error: ImageMagick does not appear to be installed. Saving an
animation to a GIF file or displaying an animation requires
ImageMagick, so please install it and try again.

See www.imagemagick.org, for example.
```
So the first line is cryptic (but could be useful in debugging, if the problem is something other than a missing 'convert'), while the rest of the message is friendlier.

Positive review on the patch. One small issue is that the animate.py doctest fails if convert is not installed:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha2$ ./sage -t devel//sage/sage/plot/animate.py 
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/plot/animate.py                    
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha2/tmp/animate.py", line 59:
    sage: a.show()
Expected nothing
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Error: ImageMagick does not appear to be installed. Saving an
    animation to a GIF file or displaying an animation requires
    ImageMagick, so please install it and try again.
    <BLANKLINE>
    See www.imagemagick.org, for example.
**********************************************************************
```

One way around this would be to make the doctest optional. 

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

This seems okay to me, but I also don't know enough about doctesting to know if there is any other choice.
