Problems are more serious than I originally thought.  I would now describe AbelianGroup and AbelianGroupElement as "severely broken".

```

sage: A = AbelianGroup(1,[0],names="a")
sage: a = A.gens()[0]
sage: B = A.subgroup([a,a,a,a]); B
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to Z x Z x Z x Z, which is the 
subgroup of
Multiplicative Abelian Group isomorphic to Z 
generated by [a, a, a, a]

```

Z<sup>4</sup> is a subgroup of Z???

```

sage: a^-1
Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'int' and 'PlusInfinity'
sage: ~a
Exception (click to the left for traceback):
...
AttributeError: 'AbelianGroup_class' object has no attribute 'fraction_field'
```

You can't compute the inverse of a group element?

Unfortunately, there is still (in sage 3.0) a serious lack of functionality for infinite abelian groups. I don't see an easy fix for this bug. Currently, it is AbelianSemiGroupExceptWhenFiniteThenItIsAbelianGroup_class:-)
