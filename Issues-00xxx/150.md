<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

OK, I created this just to mark it off. 

I solved this by adding a new option to Pyrex that embeds the source location
in the generated Pyrex code.  I think modified IPython slightly, and finally
wrote a new display of source hook that uses the embeded Pyrex info.

It works!

For SAGE-1.4.2
