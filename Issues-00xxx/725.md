For the diagonal case, the `__init__` function of `Matrix_integer_dense` contains the following code:

```
            self._zero_out_matrix()
            j = 0
            for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
                mpz_init_set(self._entries[j], x.value)
                j = j + self._nrows + 1
            self._initialized = True
```

as the _zero_out_matrix function calls mpz_init on self.entries, we should use mpz_set instead of mpz_init_set.

Attached patch fixes this.

The valgrind output of this error is similar to that of #621, but the example on that ticket uses a different code path. So this is not related.
