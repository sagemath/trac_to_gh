dilog on almost all input gives NotImplementedError:

```
sage: dilog(-1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.NotImplementedError'>   Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/was/Desktop/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/was/s/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/functions/special.py in dilog(t)
    743         return t.dilog()
    744     except AttributeError:
--> 745         raise NotImplementedError
    746
    747 def lngamma(t):

<type 'exceptions.NotImplementedError'>:
sage:                                     
```

Should add dilog to RDF, RR, CDF, CC elements, when it makes sense.

This does work:

```
sage: dilog(pari(2))
2.4674011002723396547086227499690377838 - 2.1775860903036021305006888982376139473*I

Hi,

With Pari 2.3.2:

? dilog(-1)
%1 = -0.8224670334241132182362075834 + 9.136285398175292265776793780 E-29*I

but the value should be a real number. I suppose that the imaginary
term is due to a rounding error, in which case it should be zeroed
if one knows that the mathematical result is a real number.

Note that due to this problem, the plot function fails with:
 *** plot: impossible assignment t_COMPLEX --> t_REAL.
```

Attachment: **[783-dilog_lame.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket783/783-dilog_lame.patch.gz)**

But polylog is implemented to a more serious extent, in calculus.py.  I think we should just have dilog(z) be an alias for polylog(2, z).

I've put up a patch making this change.

I'd like to reopen this ticket, since the fix only corrected integer input (here with Sage 4.3.1):

```
sage: dilog(-1.1)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (2251, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last

Pari knows how to compute this:

There is something strange in the examples added:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.pynac import py_li2_for_doctests as py_li2 
sage: py_li2(-1.1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/users/caramel/zimmerma/Adm/Stages/10/Prest/<ipython console> in <module>()

/usr/local/sage-core2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/symbolic/pynac.so in sage.symbolic.pynac.py_li2_for_doctests (sage/symbolic/pynac.cpp:15450)()

TypeError: py_li2_for_doctests() takes exactly 2 positional arguments (1 given)
```
Shouldn't `py_li2` take two arguments?

Also I've noticed the following, which maybe should be in a different ticket:

```
sage: dilog(+Infinity)
dilog(+Infinity)
sage: dilog(-Infinity)
dilog(-Infinity)
sage: limit(dilog(x),x=+Infinity)
Infinity
sage: limit(dilog(x),x=-Infinity)
-Infinity
```
Maybe `dilog(+Infinity)` and `dilog(-Infinity)` should return the corresponding limits?
