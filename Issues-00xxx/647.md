From Alex Ghitza:

```
I fiddled a bit more with the quaternion algebras, this time with
elements.  This is still warm-up for doing something more serious with
orders and ideals, starting with implementing the code by
Rodriguez-Villegas et al.
```

See attached patch.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
