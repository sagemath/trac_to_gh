Add `__mod__` to the coercion model for `Element` and change `__mod__` to `_mod_` where applicable.

We change the behaviour of `__mod__` for integer mod rings: the following (which is mathematically meaningless) is now an error:

```
             sage: a = next_prime(2**31)
             sage: b = Integers(a)(100)
             sage: a % b
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             ZeroDivisionError: reduction modulo 100 not defined
```

Apart from this, this branch does not change any semantics of remaindering.

As proof-of-concept for refactoring more generally the arithmetic methods on `Element`, the implementation of `__mod__` is different from the usual implementation:
1. `_mod_` will be added to `Element` and not `RingElement` or similar.
2. The prototype is `cpdef _mod_(self, other)` with no typing for the arguments or return value.
3. We do not implement the in-place `__imod__` which is useless anyway with coercion.

My intention is that eventually all arithmetic methods should be implemented like `__mod__`.

Is exact division (that is, division where the caller knows that there is no remainder) common enough to belong here?  (There's an implementation for Integer already, where the method is called divide_knowing_divisible_by() and calls mpz_divexact().)

I definitely think that exact division should be included in the arithmetic architecture.  This is not because it's common, but because there is a bunch of daft coercion code in most !__floordiv!__ implementations.  All this needs to be fixed and the fix is a common boiler-plate prefix on these functions.

I think that gcd (and maybe xgcd) should also be on this list.

Sure, but I don't know how common that is.

I want to avoid unneeded checking. If you do something like

```
cpdef Element _foo_(self, other):
    x = ...
    return x
```
then Cython will add a check that `x` is actually of type `Element`. I think (but this is just a wild guess) that the slow-down of these extra checks does not justify the few cases where the check might improve performance.
