I often want to test only files touched by a range of revisions.  It would be nice if there was a 'test revisions' command, so sage -tr branch:tip, sage -tr 1023, etc queried hg for changes and only tested those files.

Changeset 0e2d1b3b9389 changes sage -tnew rev to support this.

```
# By default, we compare to tip.  However, it is handy to compare against
# a certain revision, perhaps tagged 2.2 or similar:
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# Find things modified but not committed:
# % sage -tnew tip
#
# Find things modified since 2.2:
# % sage -tnew 2.2
#
# Find things modified between 2.1 and 2.2:
# % sage -tnew 2.1:2.2
```
