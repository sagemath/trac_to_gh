It would be nice to get permutation elements as dictionaries as well as lists.  If g is a permutation group element, then something like

```
  sage: g.dict()
{1:2, 2:1}
```

It would also be nice if we could have permutation elements act on lists to switch the order according to the permutation.

```
  sage: g.action(range(3))
[0,2,1]
```

Are these things possible already?

Added a patch to implement something similar to the second.  With this patch, one may do the following:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: g = G((1,2,3,4))
sage: sage: g('abcd')
'bcda'
sage: sage: g([0,1,2,3])
[1, 2, 3, 0]
sage: sage: g(('foo','bar','baz','what'))
('bar', 'baz', 'what', 'foo')
```

However, I can see absolutely no reason for one to want a dict rather than a list.  Do you have an example of where this might be useful?
