# Issue 924: [with spkg and with patch] the matplotlib spkg patches break underlying functionality

The matplotlib spkg overwrites lib/matplotlib/ticker.py with its own version.  This breaks "tick" formatting (the numbers displayed on the X and Y axis); the result is that these numbers display in scientific notation far more often than is reasonable.  (Note that this does not affect most Sage usage, since Sage turns off the matplotlib axes and draws its own.  However, Sage users should still be able to use the matplotlib package with its documented interface if they prefer.)

Note that fixing this (restoring the original ticker.py), and making no other changes, will break plotting for people who have old versions of .sage/matplotlibrc, because their matplotlibrc will not specify values for axes.formatter.limits (which is read by line 271 of ticker.py).  This should be fixed either by figuring out how to safely upgrade people's matplotlibrc (possibly hard), or by changing matplotlib so that default values for axes.formatter.limits are used if the matplotlibrc does not specify values.

I have posted a new spkg here:

http://sagemath.org/packages/experimental/matplotlib-0.91.1.spkg

DO NOT Just apply this yet.  I tested building on many systems
and it works.  However, some doctests in plot.py fail, due to changes
in matplotlib.  So it is *essential* that this ticket not be closed
and the above spkg not included in sage until a corresponding patch
against the sage library is created and posted here.
