We still have problems coercing constants into polynomial rings, when
the constants are themselves in interesting rings...

Hmm, I thought this was a bug, but the following works:
 
sage: R = ZZ['u', 'v'].fraction_field()
 
sage: EllipticCurve(R, [1,1])
 Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + x +1 over Fraction Field of
Polynomial Ring in u, v over Integer Ring
 
Maybe the previous post shouldn't work, because it's a ring, not a
field?  There are some algorithms that use the discrepancy, so
whatever happens the situation should be clarified.

But the one variable version works ...

====
sage: R = ZZ['u']
sage: EllipticCurve(R, [1,1])
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + (0)*x*y + (0)*y = x^3 + (0)*x^2 + x +1
