"sage -testall" has at least three parts (DSage unit tests, documentation doctests, library doctests).  If some documentation doctests fail, you have to know to look in the middle of the -testall output to notice; the end of the output may well say that all tests passed (meaning all library doctests).

```
$ sage -testall
