"sage -testall" has at least three parts (DSage unit tests, documentation doctests, library doctests).  If some documentation doctests fail, you have to know to look in the middle of the -testall output to notice; the end of the output may well say that all tests passed (meaning all library doctests).

This is actually not solved yet in the regular sage-test, but in sage-ptest. We need to merge the two implementations or alternatively move the features to sage-test to close this ticket.

Agreed, it's working now. I broke a test in the tutorial and some others in the main library are failing because of an upgraded Maxima spkg. They all get shown in the summary at the end:

```
$ sage -testall

...

The following tests failed:


	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/tutorial/tour_functions.rst"
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py"
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py"
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/tests/cmdline.py"
Total time for all tests: 6717.0 seconds
Please see /home/mjo/.sage//tmp/test.log for the complete log from this test.
