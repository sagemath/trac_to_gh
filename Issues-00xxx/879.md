"sage -testall" has at least three parts (DSage unit tests, documentation doctests, library doctests).  If some documentation doctests fail, you have to know to look in the middle of the -testall output to notice; the end of the output may well say that all tests passed (meaning all library doctests).

Agreed, it's working now. I broke a test in the tutorial and some others in the main library are failing because of an upgraded Maxima spkg. They all get shown in the summary at the end:

```
$ sage -testall

...

The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
