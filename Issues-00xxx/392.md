The function round() seems to ignore precision information slightly beyond the default 53 bits for a real number.  This leads to some incorrect rounding results for close calls.

```
sage: a = 5.499999999999999 
sage: a.prec()
56
sage: round(a)  ## This is ok
5.0

sage: b = 5.4999999999999999
sage: b.prec()
59
sage: round(b)  ## This isn't ok 
6.0
```

Component: **algebraic geometry**

Keywords: **round, real, precision, arithmetic**
