I found a small bit of code that gets compiled incorrectly to c.  A sample is:

```
def unlist():
        lst = [1,2]
        lst,m = lst
```

The translated c-code from this will produce an Unindexable exception.  This 
results from the fact that the variable "lst" is bound to the first element 
of the list (the integer 1) before the second element is extracted 
from "lst".  Hence it tries to unpack from the integer rather than the list.
