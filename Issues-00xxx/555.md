Attached two new bundles, total_trac_555.hg and total_trac_555_localbin.hg. The first is against the main sage repo, and the second is for $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, as you might guess from the name.

Let me know if people run into trouble; if you want to test it, do the following: make a new branch (called, say, foo) and apply the hg bundle, and then clone that (maybe call that bar). Then switch back and forth between foo and bar, and make sure that you see libcsage.dylib getting copied (along with a bunch of include files) every time you switch branches.
