When I change a pyrex file (specifically rings/integer.pyx), sage -b doesn't seem to notice. I have to manually delete the corresponding .c file to get a rebuild happening. This is mac OS 10.4.9, powerpc G5, sage 2.3.

Depedency checking works fine on OS X Intel.  In fact I wrote it under OS X intel.  I
tried exactly your example and it works. 

I also just tested on a G5 intel machine and dependency testing works fine under sage-2.3.

I have no idea how your install is messed up, but the problem isn't something general.
