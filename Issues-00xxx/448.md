spkg-check should be run upon demand after spkg-install has been run but before the build directory is deleted. In spkg-check any possible "make check" target the package offers should be run in order to catch bugs early on, especially on more exotic platforms.

Michael

This is a duplicate of #299. Because the description in #299 is better than mine I will close this ticket and assign #299 to the Sage-3.0 milestone.
