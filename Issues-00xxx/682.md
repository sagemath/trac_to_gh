     --  It would be great to have a short, simple description of
    how to save and retrieve worksheets.  And maybe there could be an
    `Open Worksheet' option on the file menu, right below `New Worksheet',
    where it usually comes.  It took be the longest time to find the `Home' button!
```

Basically, the idea of this ticket is that upload/download is confusing for some people -- maybe load/save would be clearer.  Also, he's definitely right that there should be an Open option in the File menu when one is looking at a worksheet.

I'm playing with this, and I'm not at all sure it is less confusing.  It feels more confusing to me.  Given that only one person ever complained about this, I say we do *not* make the change.  If there were more complaints than we should.

Timothy -- thanks for your work on this.  I'm sorry
