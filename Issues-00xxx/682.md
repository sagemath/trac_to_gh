     --  It would be great to have a short, simple description of
    how to save and retrieve worksheets.  And maybe there could be an
    `Open Worksheet' option on the file menu, right below `New Worksheet',
    where it usually comes.  It took be the longest time to find the `Home' button!
```

Basically, the idea of this ticket is that upload/download is confusing for some people -- maybe load/save would be clearer.  Also, he's definitely right that there should be an Open option in the File menu when one is looking at a worksheet.
