When evaluating a polynomial over Z/nZ at a point, I get a polynomial instead of a constant:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(10))
sage: f = x^2 + x + 1
sage: f(3)
3
sage: type(f(3))
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_modn_ntl_zz'>
```

It should behave more like this:

```
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)     
sage: g = y^2 + y + 1
sage: type(g(3))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```


Component: **basic arithmetic**
