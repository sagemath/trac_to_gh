All doctests in sage like this

```
 sage: numerical thing   # random low order bits
 1.234283409283408238 + 19190.9393*I
```
should be changed to

```
 sage: numerical thing
 1.234283409283408... + 19190.93...*I
```
where the ... goes for the ambiguity in low order bits. 

There are 44 such cases (at least).  See them by typing

```
sage: search_src('random low')
```

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
Patch updated (same name) to fix the failures you've seen.

About your two points, 

(1) I do all my builds with "gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5484)" and I never had any problem (on PPC though)

(2) Yes that is your fault, these patches are against 3.1.4.

So if you try again with 3.1.4 as the base and still get the other failures, I would be interested.

By the way we now have tests report for x86, x84_64 and PPC 32 now.  I would still like tests on sparc or another architecture, but if the current patch does not get any failures, then I would consider it ready to go in.

Patch looks good to me. I did not merge the hunk in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx around line 1942. That can be taken care of down the road. 

Since we will do an alpha2 shortly any numerical noise doctest failure can be fixed before rc0, so positive review.
