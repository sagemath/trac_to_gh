Many people (John Cremona and David Harvey at least) had the following problem:

```
I upgraded to 2.8.5 ok (kubuntu 7.04, kernel 2.6.20-16-generic, gcc
version 4.1.2).

sage --testall hangs at this point:
Testing SAGE constructions guide
sage -t  const.tex

and "ps -ux" shows that all the processes are in swap (S status).
Also Ctrl-C did not kill it, I am having to kill all the processes one
by one.

It turns out that "hangs forever" means takes longer than 30 seconds for many people :-). 
This actually works fine -- it's just that const.tex is really long (nearly a minute!).
