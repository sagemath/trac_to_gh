Yes.

Yes. 

Great idea!  It wouldn't be hard either, since I just
added (for sage-1.9.1) a file remote_file.py with this
function, which would make adding what you suggest
quite easy.   This will have to wait until > sage-2.0 though.
So this is now trac # 

def get_remote_file(filename, verbose=True):
    """
    INPUT:
        filename -- the URL of a file on the web, e.g.,
             "http://modular.math.washington.edu/myfile.txt"
        verbose -- whether to display download status
    OUTPUT:
        creates a file in the temp directory and returns the
        absolute path to that file.
    """
```

[07:40] <mabshoff> What about #255 - I thing that works by now, too.
[07:40] <mabshoff> Sorry, #225
[07:40] <was_> That's how I always do it, actually.
[07:41] <was_> #225 is only halfway done.
[07:41] <was_> to finish, this need to work:
[07:41] <mabshoff> okay. Should I target it for 2.9?
[07:41] <was_> load "http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/a.sage"
[07:41] <mabshoff> ok
[07:41] <was_> I bet I can implement it in 5 minutes or less.  Whatch.
[07:42] <mabshoff> Maybe I should ask you about more tickets :)
[07:49] <was_> ok, done.
[07:49] <mabshoff> :)
[07:50] <mabshoff> I will quote in the ticket.
[07:50] <was_> except i didn't get to test it from the notebook, since my local install is not done upgrading...
[07:50] <was_> it took 7 minutes.
[07:50] <mabshoff> I guess no cookie for you then :)
[07:51] <was_> oh well.  i'll try harder next time.
```
