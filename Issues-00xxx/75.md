That's a great idea.  Having an optional

```
   f = M.charpoly(x)
```
and/or

```
   f = M.charpoly(PolynomialRing(ZZ))
```
wouldn't break anything (it's optional), and would be easy 
to implement, and really just makes sense.  I like it.

In fact, we could make
    M.charpoly(z)
work for any z in any ring at all.

Say I'm doing some calculations in a power series ring with default
precision = N. Then I call some subroutine that happens to do some
power series ring calculations too. It's possible that the subroutine
will change the precision for its own purposes. When it returns, my
precision has mysteriously changed to M. This can lead to all kinds
of subtle bugs. Basically it would mean that if you use the
globalised ring, then you don't have any assurances that its
precision won't change from one step to the next. Unless you mean to
store a separate ring for each possible precision? Or maybe you mean
to force the precision to remain constant for the globalised ring?
 
Globalized rings should be immutable, so all defining properties such
as default precision, variable print name, etc., should be fixed.
SAGE currently doesn't have any mutability stuff for rings yet, but it
should, exactly for this reason.
 ```


Default precision shouldn't be changeable anyways, though. (It is, but
it shouldn't be.)
It would suck if you call a function and suddenly the default precision
of your ring gets changed.

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
In current Sage, you can already set the name of the variable (although not the ring).  Also, the problem in the original description ("f and g have different parents") is no longer true; in current Sage, f and g have the same parent.

So we're closing this ticket.
