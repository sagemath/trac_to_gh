```
sage: R.<r1, r0, s1, s2, z> = QQ['r1', 'r0', 's1', 's2', 'z']
sage: R(-r1)
-1*r1
```

This is tricky.  This is an issue with stacking rings... how does QQ['x']['y'] tell (QQ['x'](-1))*y to print as '-y'?  I don't know.

The following demonstrates this nicely:

nick's xeample is annoying, but it illustrates a completely different problem.

In any case the original multivariate example no longer fails since singular does the printing.
However this example fails:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(ZZ['x'].0^2 - 3) 
sage: R.<r1, r0, s1, s2, z> = K['r1', 'r0', 's1', 's2', 'z']
sage: -r1
(-1)*r1
```

However, since the output is correct, this is not a bug, but an enhancement issue.

The original printing issue has been solved by 2.8.1pre:

```
sage: R.<r1, r0, s1, s2, z> = QQ['r1', 'r0', 's1', 's2', 'z']
sage: R(-r1)
-r1
```
The points made by was in the replies still apply.

The attached patch fixes this bug and the associated doc-tests.  As an added bonus, it speeds up the str conversion just a little bit too.

Before patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: f=prod([2*g^2-4*g+8 for g in R.gens()])
sage: len(f.monomials())
27
sage: %timeit str(f)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.85 ms per loop
```

After patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: f=prod([2*g^2-4*g+8 for g in R.gens()])
sage: len(f.monomials())
27
sage: %timeit str(f)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.43 ms per loop
```
