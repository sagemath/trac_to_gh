While this may just simply be impossible, it would be nice if I could create interactive programs in SAGE that worked both in the command line interface and the notebook interface. The purpose of this enhancement would be for games, quizzes, wizards, etc.

This is a Python question not a SAGE question -- and yes there are billions of ways
to create interactive Python programs.  From this point of view, SAGE is just a Python
library.
