I don't understamd what you expect to be done here.  How can you coerce a polynomial over GF(5) into the field GF(5**7)?  If you mean to coerce it into a polynomial over GF(5**7) then do this:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(Q,x)(xx^2 + 2*xx + 4)
x^2 + 2*x + 4
```

or this:

```
sage: f=LL.base_extend(Q)(xx^2 + 2*xx + 4)
sage: f
xx^2 + 2*xx + 4
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in xx over Finite Field in q of size 5^7
```

Can roed explain?  Otherwise I vote for this to be closed.

David wants something like one has with quotients of polynomial rings, since finite extension fields can be thought of as polynomial quotient rings.  E.g.,:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: Q.<q> = R.quotient(x^7 + 3*x + 3)
sage: Q(x^2 + 2*x + 4)
q^2 + 2*q + 4
```

I think this is a reasonable request, since there is a natural ring homomorphism
from GF(5)['x'] to GF(5^7), when the GF(5^7) is presented as an explicit quotient of a polynomial ring modulo an irred. polynomial, as our are.

Now I understand.  In that case you can just evaluate the polynomial at the generator of the extension field:

```
sage: Q.<q> = GF(5^7)
sage: L = GF(5)
sage: LL.<xx> = L[]
sage: (xx^2 + 2*xx + 4)(q)
q^2 + 2*q + 4
```

So what roed wants is for Q(f) to evaluate as f(Q.gen()), where f is a polynomial over the base ring of Q.  That is now understandable, and reasonable, and presumably not hard to implement!
