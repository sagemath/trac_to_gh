Where is that code? Does that mean that we want to be able to run the doctests in examples? Then certainly this ought to be of much higher priority since the examples *must* work with the version of Sage that shipped it.

Cheers,

```
wstein:
Why do you think #298 should be closed?
[2:45pm] wstein:
It's more important than ever to fix.
[2:45pm] jason-:
I thought it was talking about doctesting, basically
[2:45pm] wstein:
There is a directory SAGE_ROOT/examples.
[2:45pm] wstein:
That code isn't tested at all.
[2:45pm] jason-:
to quote the comment, "where is that code"?
[2:45pm] wstein:
It's a terrifying disaster.
[2:45pm] jason-:
oh, okay
[2:45pm] jason-:
never mind
[2:46pm] wstein:
I can't believe I still haven't dealt with this... but oh well.
[2:46pm] wstein:
It's one of those things that looks easy until you try it.
