Fernando,
 You might have a thought about this:
 http://sage.math.washington.edu:9002/sage_trac/ticket/83
 
I can't log in, but the problem is this:
 
sage: len(QQ)
 
 
This never returns, so ipython waits forever, but in this case the bug is in SAGE, since infinite iterators should declare a safe len() implementation to avoid this kind of situation.
 
You can make it safe by defining:
 
    def __len__(self):
        raise TypeError('len() of unsized object')
 
 
in the class sage.rings.rational_field.RationalField.  This is the standard idiom to indicate possibly infinite iterators in the Python library:
 
In [34]: from itertools import count
 
In [35]: count??
Type:           type
Base Class:     <type 'type'>
String Form:    <type 'itertools.count'>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload/itertools.so
Docstring [source file open failed]:
    count([firstval]) --> count object
 
    Return a count object whose .next() method returns consecutive
    integers starting from zero or, if specified, from firstval.
 
 
In [36]: len(count())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
exceptions.TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
 
/home/fperez/<ipython console>
 
TypeError: len() of unsized object
 
 
Sorry I couldn't get to fixing this one before your 1.4 release, I guess it can go into 1.4.1.
 
Regards,
