From Mabshoff:

```
I have found 3 small issues in the IML 1.0.1 release. One of them is
somewhat serious (a use after free situation in certsolve.c) and two
small memory leaks. For patches see:

http://fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~mabshoff/patches/IML-1.0.1-fix-use-after-free.patch
http://fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~mabshoff/patches/IML-1.0.1-fix-trivial-mem-leak-in-largeentry.c.patch
http://fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~mabshoff/patches/IML-1.0.1-fix-trivial-mem-leak-in-smallentry.c.patch

I am CCing William and Clement because I hope that Clement might be able
to get in touch with the right people in case there is no answer and
because William told me that in the past he never got an answer from
Zhuliang and Arne. So that way we might be able to establish contact
between the IML developers and the Sage people. Since IML is supposed
to/ will get integrated into LinBox I am also curious how that will work
out.

There is one more problem I didn't fix yet (due to lack of time):

==23789== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==23789==    at 0x411BC5: RowEchelonTransform_rec (mtrans.c:212)
==23789==    by 0x411822: RowEchelonTransform_rec (mtrans.c:256)
==23789==    by 0x411822: RowEchelonTransform_rec (mtrans.c:256)
==23789==    by 0x41250E: RowEchelonTransform (mtrans.c:148)
==23789==    by 0x406F6E: specialminSolveRNS (certsolve.c:2637)

==23789==    by 0x402BFC: main (test-largeentry.c:82)


If anybody has a solution let me know.
