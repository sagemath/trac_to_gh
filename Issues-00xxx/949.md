When you run this command:

```
cwitty@magnetar:~/my-sage$ ~/sage/sage -f ~/spkg/mercurial-0.9.5.spkg 
```

the output includes this line:

```
/home/cwitty/sage/local/bin/sage-spkg: file /home/cwitty/my-sage//home/cwitty/spkg/mercurial-0.9.5.spkg does not exist
```

showing that "sage -f" does some sort of "convert relative filename to absolute", but does the operation even if the path is already absolute.

Component: **user interface**
