Between executing a cell for the first time and then reexecuting that cell, the "current directory" changes:

```
%sh
pwd
```
the first time gives the "home directory"

```
/usr/local/sage/nobody
```
upon reexecution I get

```
/usr/local/sage/nobody/sage_notebook/worksheets/loaderror/cells/2
```
i.e., the cell directory.
