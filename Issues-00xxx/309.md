While the new `Rationals().__iter__ method` is really nice and quick, I realized there is one drawback: The enumeration is not completely wrt increasing height:

```
from itertools import islice,imap

def idifference(iter):
    B = iter.next()
    for b in iter:
      yield b-B
      B=b

def height(x):
  return x.height()

[(n,min(idifference(imap(height,islice(Rationals(),Integer(2)**n))))) for n in range(Integer(1),Integer(19))]
```

yields

```
[(1, 0),
 (2, 0),
 (3, 0),
 (4, 0),
 (5, -1),
 (6, -2),
 (7, -3),
 (8, -5),
 (9, -8),
 (10, -13),
 (11, -21),
 (12, -34),
 (13, -55),
 (14, -89),
 (15, -144),
 (16, -233),
 (17, -377),
 (18, -610)]
```

so the jumps in height actually do get big. Many people will expect that if a certain number occurs in the enumeration, then all numbers of smaller height have also appeared. Therefore, we should perhaps have a choice of algorithm (since the present formula (sage 2.2) is so cool, I think it should be left in, but perhaps not as default enumeration order).

On the other hand, I realize that nobody will be using this routine anyway, so any change to this routine is essentially a waste of time.

As a thought experiment, I implemented the naive algorithm for enumerating the rationals according to the height.

So I think we should just use the naive algorithm, which is in the attached patch.  It seemed a shame to throw out Nils' code so I just commented it out and fixed its references.

I prefer this, and would definitely want to use it in preference to the clever one.  In fact I do exactly the same thing somewhere in the modular symbols code in eclib...

It would be nice to make it easier for users to create iterators to (say) loop through all rationals up to a certain height, without having to resort to "import itertools" magic.  Something like this:

```
   for q in qrange(H):
       # do something with q
```
which would loop through all rationals of height <H.

Anyway, this patch applies fine to 3.1.2.alpha3, but doctesting rational_field.py threw up this for me:

```
File "/home/john/sage-3.1.2.alpha3/tmp/rational_field.py", line 287:
    sage: [a for a in itertools.islice(Rationals(),10)]
Expected:
    [0, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, 2, -2, 1/3, -1/3, 3/2]
Got:
    [0, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, 2, -2, 1/3, -1/3, 3]
```

Thanks for looking at this, John.

I don't know enough about Python iterators at the moment to implement the more user-friendly version, but I do agree with you.

The doctest failure makes no sense, because if you look at the patch it clearly removes the line with the first 10 rationals and replaces it with the first 17 rationals.  Something must have gone wrong when you applied the patch?
