<div id="comment:0"></div>

Should the following function exist globally?

```
def sign(x):
    if x > 0:
        return 1
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    return 0
```
I'm not sure if this is identical to

```
def sign(x):
    return x.__cmp__(0)
```
I'm also ambivalent as to whether this function is called "sign", "signum", or "sgn".

To clarify: we already have:

```
sage: sgn(1)
1
sage: sgn(-4)
-1
```
so this ticket should be closed, presumably as a duplicate.
