IMPORTANT NOTE: I just realized that SAGE-2.8.3 includes some pre-compiled
java .jar files in the
     SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/notebook/java/3d
directory.  If you're the sort of person who must compile everything from source, wait
for SAGE-2.9, when we'll do something about this problem (probably the only option
is to move these to an optional package since I do not want to require java to be installed
in order to build SAGE). 

This made the extcode .hg directory *HUGE*, so we're going to have to probably
revert to right before these were added.

Some of the java code isn't GPLv2 compatible, but that's OK, since
we don't actually run that java code as part of SAGE.

Moreover, it turns out that one of the java libraries isn't GPL compatible, so it definitely has to be moved out of the core of SAGE.   We'll just have to make it easy to install.
