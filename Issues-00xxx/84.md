E.torsion_subgroup() returns an abstract group. There is no way to get hold of the torsion points (without some hacking).

Use the source, Luke!

E.torsion_subgroup??

You'll see the line:

G = self.pari_curve().elltors(flag)

Then later on you see

self.__torsion = sage.groups.all.AbelianGroup(G[1].python())

So pari computes the group, puts it in G (including generators!) and
then SAGE throws away the generators and only stores G[1].

So I guess you want self.pari_curve().elltors(0)[2].

(Actually what you *really* want is to wrap this in a new function in
SAGE so that others don't have this problem again! My recommendation:
add a new cached private attribute __torsion_generators which gets
computed whenever pari.elltors() gets called, and add a new function
E.torsion_subgroup_generators() which returns it. Even better would

be if somehow SAGE's abelian group type knows how to store
information about the "meaning" of its underlying group, but I don't
know anything about SAGE's abelian groups.

In other words, "implement it and send me -- ahem, William -- a patch!")

If this is not your style, file a bug on trac, and assign it to
dmharvey :-)

<a id='comment:3'></a>Addressed in 2.1.5.

Added class EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup class which exposes the points as generators.  This is very much a 'first cut', but it's closer to the expected behaviour.  Use E.torsion_subgroup() to access, as usual.
