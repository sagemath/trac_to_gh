Different behavior in sage shell than in regular python shell:

```
sage: x = 5
sage: y = 3
sage: assert x==y
sage:

in python:
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 3
>>> assert x==y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
>>>

```


Keywords: **python assert**

Component: **interfaces**
