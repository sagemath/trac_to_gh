See the below examples that illustrate that charpoly(A), where A is over a number field, currently totally
sucks.  This has very bad implications for modular forms computations.  Even switching to use PARI for
charpoly would give a significant speedup (which is a lot faster than Magma, interestingly). 


```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 17)

```
n = 40
m = matrix(K, n, [(a+1)^randint(0,3) for _ in xrange(n^2)])

```

**NOTE:** Sage *should* use PARI for charpoly's over number
fields, but currently it doesn't.  Notice how much faster PARI is at
the same computation!

The following IRC transcript is relevant.

```
ncalexan-827: wstein-1606: is there a good way to find degree 1 primes in a number field.
ncalexan-827: ?
wstein-1606: theoretically or in sage right now?
ncalexan-827: wstein-1606: right now, but also in theory.
wstein-1606: for all but finitely many primes you factor the defining poly of the field and see if it splits completely.
dmharvey left the chat room.
wstein-1606: you can do that more quickly by taking the gcd mod p with x^p - x
ncalexan-827: Right.
wstein-1606: or something like that.
wstein-1606: I bet you get the idea.
ncalexan-827: Doesn't this only work if your ring of integers is generated by a single element?
wstein-1606: nick -- that's why I said "all but finitely many".
wstein-1606: For all but a couple primes the ring of integers is monogenic.
wstein-1606: just avoid primes dividing the discriminant.
wstein-1606: for those do the usual factorization algorithm.
ncalexan-827: wstein-1606: sure.  It sounds like a degree_one_primes() generator would be handy for multi modular algorithms, then.
wstein-1606: yep!
wstein-1606: But beware -- it is very very very hard to find any degree one primes if the field isn't cyclotomic.
wstein-1606: For a galois S_n extension of degree n, only 1/n! of the primes split completely (by cebo.)
ncalexan-827: Hmm.  So it's not even worth it?
wstein-1606: Well it's very worth it in the cyclotomic case.
wstein-1606: more generally, in the abelian case.
wstein-1606: E.g., for quadratic fields.
wstein-1606: and even 1/n! isn't bad if n is small, which it often is.

I needed exactly this for my work on Unimodular Integer Circulants (To appear in: Mathematics of Computation) or see my web page.  At the time I used pari and have been meaning to try it in Sage too.  Rather than take gcd(f,x^p-x) -- all mof p of course -- , I took Mod(x,f*Mod(1,p))^p and that worked pretty well.  My worst example: deg(f) = 18, the first degree 1 prime was about 250 million and did not work for me so I sed the second one which was around 2 billion.  This poly has a Galois group of order only 2*(n/2)! ; if it been the generic n! I would probably still be waiting.

This suggests to me that for anything other than small degrees the implementation will need to use primes of higher degree.

I suggest that we implement the easy fix and get that merged, and open an enhancement ticket along the lines "implement multimodular algorithm for charpoly over number fields".

I'm attaching a patch with the easy fix.  On my machine, William's example runs 15 times faster after the patch than before.

<a id='comment:7'></a>
I am not happy with this patch.  I want to see an explicit doctest (not random) that has a polynomial defined over the number field, not over QQ.

I also want to see doctests for stacked relative fields -- I.e.

```
x = QQ['x'].gen()
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
L.<b> = K.extension(x^3 - a)
M.<c> = L.extension(x^2 - a*x + b)
```

and see it work for matrices over all those fields.

This is hard -- we need polynomials over arbitrary pari number fields, and it doesn't work for #2329 yet, so it shouldn't work here yet.

The point about the doctests is correct.  I put up a new patch that adds the appropriate doctests and fixes a small bug (due to some unrelated weirdness that I don't want to deal with right now).

The doctests pass and I checked the results.  It looks to me like it's working, so I'm not sure I agree with the last part of the last comment.

It was indeed an easy fix.  Pari treats the t_POLMOD 0 in a different way than the others, so the code chocked on that.  I've put up a patch that fixes this and adds a direct doctest for this behavior.

We should apply 903-ncalexan-charpoly-over-number-field-1.patch and 903-small_fix.patch.  When this ticket gets closed we should make a new enhancement ticket containing the above discussion of a multimodular algorithm.

BTW, in 3.0.alpha5, before the patches:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 17)
sage: n = 40
sage: m = matrix(K, n, [(a+1)^randint(0,3) for _ in xrange(n^2)])
sage: time f = m.charpoly('Z')
CPU times: user 59.69 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 59.70 s
Wall time: 59.70
```

and after the patches:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 17)
sage: n = 40
sage: m = matrix(K, n, [(a+1)^randint(0,3) for _ in xrange(n^2)])
sage: time f = m.charpoly('Z')
CPU times: user 3.96 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 3.98 s
Wall time: 3.98
```

it applies by itself and does build, and doctests fine.
