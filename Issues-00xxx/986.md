This doctest fails on 32-bit x86 Linux:

```
File "multi_polynomial_ideal.py", line 1078:
    sage: V = I.variety(); V
Expected:
    [{y: w^2 + 2, x: 2*w}, {y: w^2 + 2*w, x: 2*w + 2}, {y: w^2 + w, x: 2*w + 1}]
Got:
    [{y: w^2 + w, x: 2*w + 1}, {y: w^2 + 2*w, x: 2*w + 2}, {y: w^2 + 2, x: 2*w}]
```

However, the doctest succeeds on 64-bit x86 Linux.

Component: **algebraic geometry**
