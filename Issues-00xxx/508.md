Why is this supposed to work?

Anyway I did some investigation, and the problem comes from the fact that preparse() doesn't take care of "load test.sage" since that is done by ipython magic usually.  

There is very complicated logic in sage-preparse to deal with those that would be inappropriate to reproduce in sage-eval.

Also there is a very simple workaround: sage test.sage

So I vote for 'wontfix' for this bug.

Just because you couldn't fix it and there is a workaround doesn't mean it isn't a bug.

And this is still a bug in sage-3.2:

```
teragon:tmp wstein$ more a.sage
print 2^3
teragon:tmp wstein$ sage -c "load a.sage"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/wstein/sage/local/bin/sage-eval", line 10, in <module>
    eval(compile(s,tmp_filename(),'exec'))
  File "/Users/wstein/.sage//temp/teragon.local/98089//tmp_0", line 1
    load a.sage
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

```

Fixes the problem by emulating load and attach.

It won't work with files that have spaces in their name because sage, sage-sage, sage-run, and various other are not ready to deal with that, yet.

This doesn't work because when sage-eval gets run the working directory is local/bin/, so the file test.sage isn't found.  I bet you tested this patch with test.sage in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/, which is the only case when this will work:

```
teragon-2:sage-3.2 wstein$ more test.sage
print "Hi"
teragon-2:sage-3.2 wstein$ ./sage -c "load test.sage"
/Users/wstein/sage/build/sage-3.2/local/bin/sage-preparse: File test.sage is missing
python: can't open file 'test.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
teragon-2:sage-3.2 wstein$ cp test.sage local/bin/
teragon-2:sage-3.2 wstein$ ./sage -c "load test.sage"
Hi
```
