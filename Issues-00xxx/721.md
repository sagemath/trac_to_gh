ell_rational_field is too big.  I therefore propose the following changes.

1.  Create an ell_nf as a common parent for ell_rational_field and ell_number_field.  Factor up as many functions as possible.

2.  Create an Lseries_ell class in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py, and factor out the L-series functions to there (Lseries_dokchitser, Lseries_sympow, Lseries_sympow_derivs, Lseries_zeros, Lseries_zeros_in_interval, Lseries_values_along_line, Lseries_twist_values, Lseries_twist_zeros, Lseries_at1, Lseries_deriv_at1, Lseries, Lseries_extended, L1_vanishes, Lratio, ).

3.  Create a Sha_group class (inheriting from AbelianGroup).  Move the functions (sha_an_numerical, sha_an, sha_an_padic, sha_p_primary_bound, two_selmer_shabound, shabound_kolyvagin, shabound_kato, shabound) to this new class.

Hello,

the patch doesn't apply cleanly to 2.8.6, so please rebase and try again.

You should also delete obsolte version of the patch.

Cheers,

Michael
