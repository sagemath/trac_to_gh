BTW, in gap_packages there is a GPL'd package called braid that might help here. It was packaged before GPLv3 came out (I actually did the packaging but did not write any of the code).

Incidentally, apparently the braid package is now autoloaded, though it doesn't seem to be used anywhere.  This is improperly documented in interfaces/gap.py, though:

```
    The packages sonata, guava, factint, gapdoc, grape, design, toric,
    and laguna are loaded in all cases before the workspace is saved,
    if they are available.
```

```
    g = Gap(use_workspace_cache=False, max_workspace_size=None)
    for pkg in ['ctbllib', 'sonata', 'guava', 'factint', \
                'gapdoc', 'grape', 'design', \
                'toric', 'laguna', 'braid']:   # NOTE: Do *not* autoload hap - it screws up PolynomialRing(Rationals,2)
        try:
            g.load_package(pkg, verbose=verbose)

I think this problem with HAP was fixed long ago.

Also, I think I had to repackage braid recently because of some loading problems it had. I don't remember the details. Maybe it was because of a problem with gap 4.4.12 and since we use 4.4.10, it is not an issue?
