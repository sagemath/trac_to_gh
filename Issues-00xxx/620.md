This is caused when running Sage 2.8.3.6+malb's fix for #566:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```
and results in 

```
==8920== LEAK SUMMARY:

It looks like the ModularSymbols_clear_cache() does nothing:

I had a quick look at the code and we play with weak references there, so that might be the cause. Same applies to #621.

Still present in sage-6.2.beta1.

It looks like tons of rings of integer modulo p and matrix spaces over these rings are kept alive, along with their whole coercion infrastructure. The fixes at #14711 (more precisely, 0af59ea93689cb6abb9d3fae0f1cf11f2aee5cca) are not enough to prevent this from happening.

After a merging #14711 (actually `21aa9bc`) into `6.2.beta1` and applying the mercurial patch from #14072 on top, the memory leak gets under control. But it doesn't entirely disappear, as illustrated below. What happens is apparently that the entries of `sage.modular.hecke.algebra._cache` stay alive; I don't understand if it is intentional or not.
