The current testing architecture could use some spring cleaning.

ncalexan has started updating it, with the first cut having:

* better error reporting
* more flexible importing, so that, for example, a test can import its current file without full sage scoping
* a Python API so testing is integrated into the SAGE shell (and into the notebook, although this is not particularly powerful at this time)

Secondary tools might make it:

* easier to order the tests in some way, such as most recently modified or last failing test first
* easy to mine the examples for documenting
* possible to generate statistics and other useful tidbits from the existing examples

If you're interested in a particular feature, please let ncalexan know.

We should break this ticker up in bits that we want to get done and close this ticker as invalid since it is a hodgepodge of various things.

I have moved the Python API request to #2630.  #679 provides statistics and better error reporting.  I am closing this as the rest of the items are too vague to create individual tickets for.

Do not invalidate tickets like this since it is certainly a borderline case. Me not objecting in IRC is *not* approval ;)
