```
The following code causes incorrect output:

```
sage: M=random_matrix(ZZ,3,2)

sage: M.elementary_divisors()
 [1, 1, 0]

sage: edivs=M.elementary_divisors()

sage: edivs.pop()
 0

sage: edivs
 [1, 1]

sage: M.elementary_divisors()
 [1, 1]
```
The problem seems to be elementary_divisors() caches the result, but returns a mutable object.

Component: **linear algebra**
