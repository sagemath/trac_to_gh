<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
There are supposedly some patches in the last Sage spkg. So it would be nice to find out

a) who build the spkg\
b) which patches were applied (if any)
c) if there were patches if they are still needed

If they are needed we should push the patches upstream.

Cheers,

Michael
