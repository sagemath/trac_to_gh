The following bug was found by Thea Gegenberg. There seems to be in inconsistency in how elements in a ring Integers(D) for a bigger D are represented and there don't seem to be automatic coercions between the different representatives.

The culprits are IntegerMod_int, IntegerMod_int64 and IntegerMod_gmp (not illustrated here, but with bigger D similar errors arise wrt. gmp.)

This code illustrates the problem:

```
A=matrix([(70, 49, -20, -34, 57), (-49, -14, 95, 43, 85), (-95, -63, 68, 52, 12), (11,
-16, -50, 43, 76), (-55, 83, 55, 40, -14)])
D=A.determinant()
R=Integers(D)
MD=MatrixSpace(R,A.nrows(),A.ncols())
AD=MD(A)
# You would expect elements of R and entries of AD to be of exactly the same type.
# this is not the case, however:
print parent(AD.row(1)[1])
print parent(R(3))
# Indeed, the types of these are not the same:
print type(AD.row(1)[1])
print type(R(3))
# and this has consequences: You'd expect the following to work, but it gives an error:
R(3)*AD.row(1)
```
