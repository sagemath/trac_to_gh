As a workaround on Solaris 9 we define:

```
#if defined(__sun)
extern long double fabsl (long double);
extern long double sinl (long double);
extern long double cosl (long double);
extern long double sqrtl (long double);
extern long double coshl (long double);
extern long double sinhl (long double);
#endif
```
Problem is that this file is C++, so those externs need to be defined as extern "C". Otherwise the linker mangles the function names and consequently Sage doesn't start complaining about missing symbols.

Cheers,

Michael
