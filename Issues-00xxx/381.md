There are several options:

1) use screen - see www.gnu.org/software/screen/
2) use nohup - see man nohup
3) use disown - see http://www.faqs.org/docs/bashman/bashref_79.html

All have their specific advantages, I would just go with screen.

It might be worthwhile to offer an option for SAGE to demonize itself.

Cheers,
Michael Abshoff

Well, the idea is to detach the running SAGE instance from the shell
to let it run in the background until it is killed or the system is
rebooted.

There is more than one way to do it: For a good C example see
http://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php - for a python example
see http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/66012

The python example could be more or less copied (I guess because I am
not a python expert), but it should be done very early in the SAGE
startup as far as I can tell. Writing a little C wrapper that just
does

 i=fork();
 if (i<0) exit(1); /* fork error */
 if (i>0) exit(0); /* parent exits */
 /* child (daemon) continues */
 execv("./sage");

might be easier.
```

Look at #7893 ([https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7893](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7893)).

It would be good to incorporate the idea of the example to the script in the previous ticket.

True, `nohup` itself doesn't daemonize. But normally you would do

```
$ nohup sage -n &
```
It's the `&` at the end which does the "daemonization".

This refers to traditional Unix daemons, which would be quite different from a Sage "daemon" started by an ordinary user.

So it's not clear to me what would be needed for a Sage daemon which is not covered by

```
$ nohup sage &
```

I think traditional daemonization is the right way to solve this problem.  Moreover, it would be a useful step for making it easy to run a sage server as part of the usual system-wide daemons on Unix.

Well, you'd at least also have to `>/dev/null`.

Inherited file descriptors other than 0, 1 and 2 are left untouched.

`nohup` doesn't change the working directory, nor e.g. modify the umask.

The background process doesn't get adopted by `init` until you logout, and similar process group specific stuff I think.
