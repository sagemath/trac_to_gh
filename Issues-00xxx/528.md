Currently `Integer_mod_dense` wraps the `ZZX` class in `ntl.pyx`. This causes a lot of overhead for small polynomials.

The patch `poly-int-dense1.hg` moves `Polynomial_integer_dense` to a new cython file `polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.pyx` and renames the class to `Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl`, and minimal changes needed to make this build and pass tests.

This is the first step in addressing this ticket. Next step will be to change the underlying implementation to work with the NTL ZZX object directly instead of via `ntl.pyx`.

Already there's an improvement in overheads for arithmetic on small objects:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = x^2 + x^3 - 5*x^4
sage: g = 47*x^2 + 3
sage: timeit h = f * g
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.8 µs per loop
```
vs

```
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.7 µs per loop
```

I've added a patch `patch-528.hg`. This makes the `Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl` class talk directly to NTL, instead of wrapping an NTL object from ntl.pyx.

Also it adds many new doctests for polynomials over Z.

It's still pretty damn ugly though. Just the minimum to get the job done. A lot of work is still needed.

I think it basically works, but I wasn't able to run doctests properly because there are currently lots of other doctest failures in the repository.
