The patch `poly-int-dense1.hg` moves `Polynomial_integer_dense` to a new cython file `polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.pyx` and renames the class to `Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl`, and minimal changes needed to make this build and pass tests.

This is the first step in addressing this ticket. Next step will be to change the underlying implementation to work with the NTL ZZX object directly instead of via `ntl.pyx`.

Already there's an improvement in overheads for arithmetic on small objects:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = x^2 + x^3 - 5*x^4
sage: g = 47*x^2 + 3
sage: timeit h = f * g
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.8 µs per loop
```
vs

```
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.7 µs per loop
```

Some thoughts to consider: 

* How far away is FLINT from doing the basic arithmetic at least? If it is close, how much effort should be spent on this? 
* Is there anything to learn from the re-wrapping of NTL by Craig Citro and Joel Mohler?

I don't know. I am not working on FLINT presently due to lack of time. The amount of effort required to get FLINT to production standard appears to be way more than the time required to get this ticket done.

> Is there anything to learn from the re-wrapping of NTL by Craig Citro and Joel Mohler?


Yes most definitely. I've discussed with this Joel, and I'll be studying that code before moving onto the next phase.

I've added a patch `patch-528.hg`. This makes the `Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl` class talk directly to NTL, instead of wrapping an NTL object from ntl.pyx.

Also it adds many new doctests for polynomials over Z.

It's still pretty damn ugly though. Just the minimum to get the job done. A lot of work is still needed.

I think it basically works, but I wasn't able to run doctests properly because there are currently lots of other doctest failures in the repository.
