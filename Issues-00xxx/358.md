Actually, it looks like someone has already fixed this ticket a while ago. John, I don't think your patch actually does anything significantly different, it just looks like a code rearrangement? (Although I do prefer the way you have written it to what was there before.)

OK, you are right.  I thought it was pointless to store the heights in a separate array and then put them in the matrix diagonal later.  So you can decide whether or not this patch should get used, and either way the ticket can be closed!
