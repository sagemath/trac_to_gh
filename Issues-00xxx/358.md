The function `padic_height_pairing_matrix()` is a bit lazy. It should do less work along the diagonal. e.g. for rank 2, if the generators are P and Q, it computes h(P), h(Q), h(P+Q), h(P+P), h(Q+Q). Clearly the last two are silly.

OK, you are right.  I thought it was pointless to store the heights in a separate array and then put them in the matrix diagonal later.  So you can decide whether or not this patch should get used, and either way the ticket can be closed!
