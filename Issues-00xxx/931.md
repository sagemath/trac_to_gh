I think SAGE is still the only mathematical
software with an implementation of the permanent function for
non-square matrices over an arbitrary field!

But it is frickin' slow, as William could have said.
Calculating the permanent of a 13 x 17 matrix with a 'band' of 4 1's
over the main diagonal.


Over ZZ:
> sage: time f(13,4)
> CPU times: user 3.98 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 4.05 s
> Wall time: 4.08
>  1596800



Over QQ
> sage: time f(13,4)
> CPU times: user 8.39 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 8.48 s
> Wall time: 8.56
>  1596800


My all C-program with ints based on gmp:
> [jaap@paix perm_gmp]$ time ./ds 13 4
> 1596800
> real    0m0.328s
> user    0m0.326s
> sys     0m0.003s
> [jaap@paix perm_gmp]$ 


In the reference manual it still says that the code is optimized
only for matrices over QQ :-)!

What we need is optimization for integer matrices (followed by more
optimization for (0,1) matrices, eventually for (-1,0,1) matrices.
That are the matrices that 'count' in applications.).

A speed boost can be achieved replacing 'my' pure Python function
_combinations, to be found in sage.structure.sequence, with a real fast
implementation in C/Cython.

I'm sorry for the double attachment!

Timing

```
sage: time dance(7)
h^7 - 14*h^6 + 126*h^5 - 700*h^4 + 2625*h^3 - 6342*h^2 + 9072*h - 5840
CPU times: user 25.20 s, sys: 0.46 s, total: 25.65 s
Wall time: 26.08
```

in sage-2.8.9:

```
sage: time dance(7)
h^7 - 14*h^6 + 126*h^5 - 700*h^4 + 2625*h^3 - 6342*h^2 + 9072*h - 5840
CPU times: user 42.64 s, sys: 1.12 s, total: 43.76 s
Wall time: 43.96

```

This is not the last word on this issue.
