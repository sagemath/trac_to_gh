Updated patch clique_ind_set-2.patch.  Apply this instead of the first patch.

This adds an option to the is_clique to check if it is a directed clique (i.e., edges in each direction exist) in the case the graph is a directed graph.  This patch also puts both functions into GeneralGraph to make them available to directed graphs.  It also deletes the (now redundant) independent_set function in GeneralGraph.

This functionality now gives us the Combinatorica EmptyQ and CompleteQ functions, as well as the CliqueQ and IndependentSetQ functions.

This patch looks ready for inclusion. Jason -- do you notice any other functions that could be moved to GeneralGraph?
