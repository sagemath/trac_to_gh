The functionality for associating any vertex of a graph with an arbitrary object is very nice.  However, it seems like the implementation could be simplified.  Can we implement an interface that does the following?

* Makes it easy to assign an object to a single vertex, multiple vertices, or all vertices.  (Currently, you must assign the entire graph at once).

* Makes it easy to retrieve an object associated with a vertex or multiple objects associated with multiple vertices (currently we can only retrieve one vertex at a time).

* Has symmetry in the get/set functions (currently there is an "associate" and a "obj" function).

It seems that the simplest way to deal with multiple vertices is to use a dictionary, as is currently done, to associate a set of vertices with their corresponding objects.

Here's an example of a possible idea:

```
  sage: g=Graph();
  sage: g.add_vertices(10);
  sage: g.set_vertices({0: 'vertex0', 1: 'vertex1'})
  sage: g.set_vertex({3: 'vertex3'})
  sage: g.set_vertex(4,'vertex4')
  sage: g.get_vertices()
  {0: 'vertex0', 1: 'vertex1', 3: 'vertex3', 4: 'vertex4'}
  sage: g.get_vertex(0)
  'vertex0'
  sage: g.get_vertices([0,1])
  {0: 'vertex0', 1: 'vertex1'}
```

Of course, in the above example, the strings could have been replaced with any objects.
