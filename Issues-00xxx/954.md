Flint requires C99 capable compilers. gcc 3.4.x and later are, but gcc 3.3 and earlier are not. There are still a number of those older compilers around, so error out early right away with an understandable error message to avoid bug reports with flint compiling to fail.

Cheers,

Michael

Attachment: **[test_gcc_version.pl](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket954/test_gcc_version.pl)**

I wrote a perl script to test if gcc version is greater than or equal to 3.4.0. 
It exits 0 if this is the case and 1 otherwise. 

The flint spkg-install should be easily modified to run this script and test the exit code and
take appropriate action. I didn't know what the desired behavior was so I didn't do this yet.

More specifically adding this to the top of the flint spkg-install should be enough

```
./test_gcc_version.pl
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "GCC version less than 3.4.0"
   echo "Flint will not be able to compile successfully"
   exit 1
