Flint requires C99 capable compilers. gcc 3.4.x and later are, but gcc 3.3 and earlier are not. There are still a number of those older compilers around, so error out early right away with an understandable error message to avoid bug reports with flint compiling to fail.

Cheers,

Michael

At least for gcc we can probably use

```
gcc -dumpversion
```

This can't be written using python, so...
maybe in perl?

I wrote a perl script to test if gcc version is greater than or equal to 3.4.0. 
It exits 0 if this is the case and 1 otherwise. 

The flint spkg-install should be easily modified to run this script and test the exit code and
take appropriate action. I didn't know what the desired behavior was so I didn't do this yet.

```
./test_gcc_version.pl
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "GCC version less than 3.4.0"
   echo "Flint will not be able to compile successfully"
   exit 1
