Hi,

GMP-ECM-6.1.3 has been released. This is a bugfix release.

Changes between ecm-6.1.2 and ecm-6.1.3:

   * fixed incorrect computation of memory use in stage 2, especially for
     machines that use Kronecker-Schoenhage multiplication even for large
     degrees, such as Core 2
   * fixed -B2scale option whose value hadn't been passed to the factoring
     routines
   * fixed default B2min for P-1 which could be truncated on 32 bit 
machines,
     causing stage 2 to take a little longer than necessary
   * fixed bug for modular multiplication modulo Fermat numbers 2^2^n+1, 
where
     a result of 2^2^n would be truncated to 0


The new version is available at https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/ecm/.

We would like to thank Peter-Lawrence Montgomery, Andreas Schindel and 
George Woltman for their bug reports.

Enjoy,
Alex

Cheers,

Michael
