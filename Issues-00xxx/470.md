Valgrinding Sage 2.8.2rc1 tells me:

```

==2609==    by 0x49DE34: PyImport_ImportModuleLevel (import.c:2066)
```

An empty start up & quit immediately Sage session under valgrind shows about 130 MB of memory still reachable at exit. The vast amount of that is the libpari stack.

William stated that this is non-trivial to fix and will probably require changes in libpari itself. 

I would like to state that any application that needs that much stack space should be considered "broken by design". 

Cheers,

Michael

Ok, after looking at init_stack in the pari source code it might be as simple as doing a 

```
sage_free((void*)Bot)

upon exiting Sage. I haven't tried it, though.

Check out:

http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0511/msg00037.html

and maybe (older and possibly obsoleted by the above)

http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-0301/msg00021.html

Also the pari manual discusses initialization/deinitialization in section 5.1.

In principle,

```
pari_close()
```
should be enough to free everything.

As it turned out the problem is still there with 2.8.7.alpha0:

```
==22424== 8,000,000 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 2,941 of 2,941
