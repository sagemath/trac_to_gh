Thanks William. Moving /usr/include/boost to /usr/include/boost.old and
typing again make in SAGE_ROOT did it. You can recommend it to users who
encounter the same problem.
```

So, can we turn off Singular using boost at all, by default?

Well, we should fix the bug upstream by fixing the boost detection code or alternatively introducing a switch to turn off boost.
