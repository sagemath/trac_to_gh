Thanks William. Moving /usr/include/boost to /usr/include/boost.old and
typing again make in SAGE_ROOT did it. You can recommend it to users who
encounter the same problem.
```

So, can we turn off Singular using boost at all, by default?

Well, we should fix the bug upstream by fixing the boost detection code or alternatively introducing a switch to turn off boost.

Cheers,

We can't just turn it off because they don't have an option for that for their configure script. Also, fiddling with that script is tricky because it is created from a configure.in newer autoconfs don't understand. I'll report this upstream.
