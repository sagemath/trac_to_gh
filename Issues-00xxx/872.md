I have tracked down the problem.  It is due to coefficient explosion in libfac/charset/csutil.cc:alg_gcd() (which implements the Euclidean gcd algorithm).  There is an attempt to control the coefficient size in the function myfitting(), but it is ineffective for this problem.

myfitting() controls coefficient size by dividing by the leading coefficient (an integer), and then clearing denominators.  I have attached a patch that makes myfitting use a different notion of "leading coefficient", where the algebraic variable is considered to be part of the coefficient domain.

This patch does vastly speed up this particular problem, but I would like somebody who knows more about the internals of Singular to look at it before it gets applied (so I am not yet marking it "with patch").

[11:50am] wstein2: hi: regarding #872.
[11:50am] wstein2: the new spkg definitely fixes the bug reported there with factoring.
[11:51am] wstein2: But I tried factoring in a 2-variable ring and it quickly runs out of steam.  E.g., this fails:
[11:51am] wstein2: > ring r=(0,a),(x,y),dp;
[11:51am] wstein2: > minpoly = a^2+1;
[11:51am] wstein2: > factorize(x^12 + y^12);
```
