myfitting() controls coefficient size by dividing by the leading coefficient (an integer), and then clearing denominators.  I have attached a patch that makes myfitting use a different notion of "leading coefficient", where the algebraic variable is considered to be part of the coefficient domain.

This patch does vastly speed up this particular problem, but I would like somebody who knows more about the internals of Singular to look at it before it gets applied (so I am not yet marking it "with patch").
