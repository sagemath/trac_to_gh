trac doesn't work at all in Python 2.5, hence not with SAGE. 

I've moved it to the experimental package repo.

The ClearSilver developer is on vacation, though, so it
probably won't be fixed for a couple of weeks. Just stay with Python
2.4 a little longer (or, possibly, dive into the clearsilver source
and see what the problem is).
