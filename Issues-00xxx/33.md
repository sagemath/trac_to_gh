when pasting a *huge* input file into the worksheet,
   the input text area is not sufficiently large.  It
   stays too small.  Weird.   We need a good way to literally
   attach a file to the worksheet, then edit it in the worksheet.

This was fixed in William's recent update to the notebook.  From the "data" menu, select "upload or create a file", enter a name into the resultant form, and edit away!  You can copy this file to other worksheets and further edit the file through the data menu.
