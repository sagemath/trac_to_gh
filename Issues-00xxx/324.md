I'm just building sage on a dual core G5 powerpc and noticed that NTL seems to get built in 32-bit mode, even though it's a 64-bit machine... here's part of the build log:

```
This is NTL version 5.4

GOOD NEWS: compatible machine.
summary of machine characteristics:
bits per long = 32
bits per int = 32
bits per size_t = 32
arith right shift = yes
double precision = 53
NBITS (maximum) = 30
single mul ok = yes
register double precision = 53
double rounding detected = no
```
