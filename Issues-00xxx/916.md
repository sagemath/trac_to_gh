`_combinations` does the same as `combinations_iterator` but is slower. The attached patch therefor removes it and replaces all calls to it by calls to `combinations_iterator`.

```
sage: time l1 = list(combinations_iterator(range(100),3))
CPU times: user 0.91 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.91 s
Wall time: 0.93
sage: time l2 = list(_combinations(range(100),3))
CPU times: user 3.96 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 4.09 s
Wall time: 4.13
sage: l1 == l2
