no on #719.
[18:40] <mabshoff_> ok
[18:40] <william_stein> Lots of pari is unusable with < 100MB stack.
[18:40] <william_stein> And it's a *serious* pain to have to do it randomly in the middle of computations.
[18:40] <mabshoff_> really? That sucks.
[18:40] <william_stein> PARI doesn't automatically double the stack.
