I would suggest something like 16MB (because that out to be enoughfor the casual user and if needed it would rapidly grown past the 100MB mark), double the amount of memory with each pari.allocatemen() up until you reach 0.5GB, and then increment by say 128MB. Bonus points for introducing an optional parameter to set the size for the libpari stack.

no on #719.
[18:40] <mabshoff_> ok
[18:40] <william_stein> Lots of pari is unusable with < 100MB stack.
[18:40] <william_stein> And it's a *serious* pain to have to do it randomly in the middle of computations.
[18:40] <mabshoff_> really? That sucks.
[18:40] <william_stein> PARI doesn't automatically double the stack.
