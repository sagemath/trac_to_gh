On a clean vanilla sage 1.4 install (running on sage.math), the doctest for `devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/maxima.py` just freezes. SAGE never seems to pick up the timeout. I hit ctrl-c, and the doctests proceed normally after that.

This is a very annoying bug that only happens on 64-bit linux.  I will have to carefully step through the problem.  It shouldn't be hard to fix though.
