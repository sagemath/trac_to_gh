The attached mercurial bundle has the c_lib moved into the tree and some other enhancements as well:

1)  Many modifications to .hgignore to make it ignore c_lib junk and keep it from ignore .h files and .c files only under sage/
2)  setup.py misc improvements
3)  setup.py checks for recursive dependencies on .pyx files.  So if you have a deep includes -- i.e. a .pxi included from a .pxi, it will now include this in the age comparisons.  Unfortunately, this approximately doubles the time on a no-op build.  I don't know what other people think about this, but I'm rather freakish about knowing that my builds are reliable so I think it is worth it.

Ignore the attachment c_lib_in_tree_and_setup_enhancements.hg

The attachment c_lib_into_main.patch lacks some setup_enhancements of the first patch, but it is converted to scons.

The scons-0.97.spkg from the experimental repository is needed for this patch.

Attachment: **[strdup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket411/strdup.patch.gz)**

I incorporated this in.  There were some weird issues with mpz_get_pyintlong not being defined, which I fixed
by adding back some files to ext.  Fix this correctly in the future.
