```
sage: edit?
```
presently yields

```
 ...
          sage: import sage.misc.edit_module as m
          sage: m.set_edit_template("vi -c {line} {file}")
 ...
```
whereas the last line should read

```
         sage: m.set_edit_template("vi -c ${line} ${file}")
```
i.e., $ gets stripped from EXAMPLE text where it should not.

$ signs are stripped from docstrings in sage/misc/sagedoc.py, as part of an effort to convert LaTeX math markup to plain text.

Perhaps the right fix is to notice doctests, and disable these modifications for that part of the docstring.

Attachment: **[683-989-ncalexan-1.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket989/683-989-ncalexan-1.patch.gz)**

Changelog for the patch:

683,989: add 'nodetex' directive to docstrings: doesn't strip (la)tex code from docstrings.

The first line of a docstring is parsed as a comma-separated list of
directives (no whitespace in directives!).  For example:

```
r"""nodetex,notyetimplemented
...
"""
```

If 'nodetex' is one of the directives, then no (la)tex code is stripped from
the docstring.  The model was the 'nodoctest' directive already found at the
top of a file.
