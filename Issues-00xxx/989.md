```
sage: edit?
```
presently yields

```
 ...
          sage: import sage.misc.edit_module as m
          sage: m.set_edit_template("vi -c {line} {file}")
 ...
```
whereas the last line should read

```
         sage: m.set_edit_template("vi -c ${line} ${file}")
```
i.e., $ gets stripped from EXAMPLE text where it should not.

$ signs are stripped from docstrings in sage/misc/sagedoc.py, as part of an effort to convert LaTeX math markup to plain text.

Perhaps the right fix is to notice doctests, and disable these modifications for that part of the docstring.

**Attachment:** [683-989-ncalexan-1.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket989/683-989-ncalexan-1.patch.gz)

Changelog for the patch:

683,989: add 'nodetex' directive to docstrings: doesn't strip (la)tex code from docstrings.

The first line of a docstring is parsed as a comma-separated list of
directives (no whitespace in directives!).  For example:

```
r"""nodetex,notyetimplemented
...
"""
```

If 'nodetex' is one of the directives, then no (la)tex code is stripped from
the docstring.  The model was the 'nodoctest' directive already found at the
top of a file.
