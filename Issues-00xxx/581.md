By the way: The fix for #498 never made it into 2.8.3:

```
sage: M=Matrix(Integers(),20,20,L)
sage: M.det()
ERROR in reconstruction ?

0
sage: M.rank()
20
sage:
```
William, do you have a clue what happened to the fixed spkg? I certainly send you a link. The SPKG.txt also doesn't contain my change log entry.

Cheers,

Michael
