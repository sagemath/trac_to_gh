Hello,

The current LinBox package in Sage 2.8.2 has the following assignments in spkg-install

```
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\"-L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\""
CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fPIC -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\"  -L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\""
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS  -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL\"/include"
```
but uses the configure with the following options:

```
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-givaro="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-ntl="$SAGE_LOCAL" $OPS --with-blas="$LINBOX_BLAS"
```
This is due to a bug in LinBox where for exmaple GMP_CFLAGS is not propagated down into the Makefiles (via Makefile.am). I have fixed this for the GMP and I assume that it is the same fix for NTL and Givaro. The GMP fix already made it into LinBox-20070814.spkg and I did verify on my systems that the right gmp selected during configure is also linked against. Once I have made the fixes for NTL and Givaro I will push those fixes toward LinBox upstream.

Cheers,

Michael

linbox appears to have several errors. 

* #7058 
* -m64  (a GNUism in itself) hard coded on only OS X, so it will not build 64-bit with Solaris. 
* The issues you mention here. 
* The fact -fPIC is a GNU specific flag. 

I'm a bit reluctant to go around editing any more spkg-install files, until we have in place a better system for dealing with the 64-bit issues which is not dependent on a particular platform or compiler. This spkg-install makes the assumption the only compiler is gcc (not true) and the only operating system on which one might want to force a 64-bit build is OS X (again not true). It was rather short-sighted the way this SAGE64 issue was handled. 

Once there is a way of handling this better, I'll revise this. #7505 is needing review and will allow the compiler to be determined. Later I will add an updated version of sage-env, which will set the flags globally. But it needs #7505 to be integrated first.
