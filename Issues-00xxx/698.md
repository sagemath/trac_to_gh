This comparison was done using Mathematica version 6 and  Combinatorica version 2.1.0.\n\nAttached is a spreadsheet listing the SAGE graph library functions and the equivalent functions in Combinatorica.  I've also put a few notes in about the implementation differences and other notes suggesting changes to SAGE functions.\n\nIn the following list, I tried to make the functions link to the official documentation at the Wolfram website.  I hope it all worked right.\n\n* [AlternatingPaths](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/AlternatingPaths.html)[g, start, ME] returns the alternating paths in graph g with respect to the matching ME, starting at the vertices in the list start.

**Notes:** The list below has been moved to the [Graph Theory Roadmap](../wiki/GraphTheoryRoadmap).

Here is a list of graph operations included in the Mathematica Combinatorica package , but not implemented in the SAGE graph classes.  This comparison was done using Mathematica version 6 and  Combinatorica version 2.1.0.

Attached is a spreadsheet listing the SAGE graph library functions and the equivalent functions in Combinatorica.  I've also put a few notes in about the implementation differences and other notes suggesting changes to SAGE functions.

In the following list, I tried to make the functions link to the official documentation at the Wolfram website.  I hope it all worked right.

* [AlternatingPaths](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/AlternatingPaths.html)[g, start, ME] returns the alternating paths in graph g with respect to the matching ME, starting at the vertices in the list start. The paths are returned in the form of a forest containing trees rooted at vertices in start.

* [AnimateGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/AnimateGraph.html)[g, l] displays graph g with each element in the list l successively highlighted. Here l is a list containing vertices and edges of g. An optional flag, which takes on the values All and One, can be used to inform the function about whether objects highlighted earlier will continue to be highlighted or not. The default value of flag is All. All the options allowed by the function Highlight are permitted by [AnimateGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/AnimateGraph.html), as well. See the usage message of Highlight for more details.

* [AntiSymmetricQ](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/AntiSymmetricQ.html)[g] yields True if the adjacency matrix of g represents an anti-symmetric binary relation.

* [ApproximateVertexCover](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/ApproximateVertexCover.html)[g] produces a vertex cover of graph g whose size is guaranteed to be within twice the optimal size.

* [BiconnectedComponents](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/BiconnectedComponents.html)[g] gives a list of the biconnected components of graph g. If g is directed, the underlying undirected graph is used.

* [BiconnectedQ](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/BiconnectedQ.html)[g] yields True if graph g is biconnected. If g is directed, the underlying undirected graph is used.

* [BipartiteMatchingAndCover](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/BipartiteMatchingAndCover.html)[g] takes a bipartite graph g and returns a matching with maximum weight along with the dual vertex cover.

The function takes two options: Type and [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html), with default values Undirected and False, respectively. When Type is set to Directed, the function produces the underlying directed acyclic graph. When [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html) is set to True, labels are produced for the vertices.

* [BrelazColoring](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/BrelazColoring.html)[g] returns a vertex coloring in which vertices are greedily colored with the smallest available color in decreasing order of vertex degree.

Here bits are counted left to right. An option [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html), with default setting False, is allowed.

[CageGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CageGraph.html)[r] gives [CageGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CageGraph.html)[3, r]. For k = 3, r can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10. For k = 4 or 5, r can be 3, 4, 5, or 6.

* [ChangeVertices](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/ChangeVertices.html)[g, v] replaces the vertices of graph g with the vertices in the given list v. v can have the form {{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ...} or the form {{{x1, y1}, gr1}, {{x2, y2}, gr2}, ...}, where {x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ... are coordinates of points and gr1, gr2, ... are graphics information associated with vertices.

* [ChromaticNumber](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/ChromaticNumber.html)[g] gives the chromatic number of the graph, which is the fewest number of colors necessary to color the graph.

* [ChromaticPolynomial](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/ChromaticPolynomial.html)[g, z] gives the chromatic polynomial P(z) of graph g, which counts the number of ways to color g with, at most, z colors.

* [CirculantGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CirculantGraph.html)[n, l] constructs a circulant graph on n vertices, meaning the ith vertex is adjacent to the (i+j)th and (i-j)th vertices, for each j in list l.

* [CircularEmbedding](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CircularEmbedding.html)[n] constructs a list of n points equally spaced on a circle. [CircularEmbedding](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CircularEmbedding.html)[g] embeds the vertices of g equally spaced on a circle.

* [CompleteQ](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CompleteQ.html)[g] yields True if graph g is complete. This means that between any pair of vertices there is an undirected edge or two directed edges going in opposite directions.

* Contract[g, {x, y}] gives the graph resulting from contracting the pair of vertices {x, y} of graph g.

* [CubeConnectedCycle](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/CubeConnectedCycle.html)[d] returns the graph obtained by replacing each vertex in a d-dimensional hypercube by a cycle of length d. Cube-connected cycles share many properties with hypercubes but have the additional desirable property that for d > 1 every vertex has degree 3.

* [DeBruijnGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DeBruijnGraph.html)[m, n] constructs the n-dimensional De Bruijn graph with m symbols for integers m > 0 and n > 1. [DeBruijnGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DeBruijnGraph.html)[alph, n] constructs the n-dimensional De Bruijn graph with symbols from alph. Here alph is nonempty and n > 1 is an integer. In the latter form, the function accepts an option [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html), with default value False, which can be set to True, if users want to associate strings on alph to the vertices as labels.

If g does not contain c, it is returned unchanged; otherwise g is returned with c deleted." 

* Dijkstra[g, v] gives a shortest-path spanning tree and associated distances from vertex v of graph g. The shortest-path spanning tree is given by a list in which element i is the predecessor of vertex i in the shortest-path spanning tree. Dijkstra does not work correctly when the edge weights are negative; [BellmanFord](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/BellmanFord.html) should be used in this case.

* [DilateVertices](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DilateVertices.html)[v, d] multiplies each coordinate of each vertex position in list v by d, thus dilating the embedding. [DilateVertices](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DilateVertices.html)[g, d] dilates the embedding of graph g by the factor d.

* [DominationLattice](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DominationLattice.html)[n] returns a Hasse diagram of the partially ordered set on integer partitions of n in which p < q if q dominates p. The function takes two options: Type and [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html), with default values Undirected and False, respectively. When Type is set to Directed, the function produces the underlying directed acyclic graph. When [VertexLabel](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexLabel.html) is set to True, labels are produced for the vertices.

* [EdgeChromaticNumber](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/EdgeChromaticNumber.html)[g] gives the fewest number of colors necessary to color each edge of graph g, so that no two edges incident on the same vertex have the same color.

* [EdgeWeight](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/EdgeWeight.html) is an option that allows the user to associate weights with edges. 1 is the default weight. [EdgeWeight](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/EdgeWeight.html) can be set as part of the graph data structure.

Equivalences[g, h, f1, f2, ...] and Equivalences[g, f1, f2, ...] can also be used, where f1, f2, ... are functions that compute other vertex invariants. It is expected that for each function fi, the call fi[g, v] returns the corresponding invariant at vertex v in graph g. The functions f1, f2, ... are evaluated in order, and the evaluation stops either when all functions have been evaluated or when an empty equivalence class is found. Three vertex invariants, [DegreesOf2Neighborhood](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/DegreesOf2Neighborhood.html), [NumberOf2Paths](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/NumberOf2Paths.html), and Distances are Combinatorica functions and can be used to refine the equivalences.

[FunctionalGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/FunctionalGraph.html)[f, v], where f is a list of functions, constructs a graph with vertex set v and edge set (x, fi(x)) for every fi in f.

* [UnweightedQ](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/UnweightedQ.html)[g] yields True if all edge weights are 1 and False otherwise.

* [VertexColoring](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexColoring.html)[g] uses Brelaz's heuristic to find a good, but not necessarily minimal, vertex coloring of graph g. An option Algorithm that can take on the values Brelaz or Optimum is allowed. The setting Algorithm -> Brelaz is the default, while the setting Algorithm -> Optimum forces the algorithm to do an exhaustive search to find an optimum vertex coloring.

* [VertexConnectivity](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexConnectivity.html)[g] gives the minimum number of vertices whose deletion from graph g disconnects it. [VertexConnectivity](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexConnectivity.html)[g, Cut] gives a set of vertices of minimum size, whose removal disconnects the graph.

* [VertexConnectivityGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexConnectivityGraph.html)[g] returns a directed graph that contains an edge corresponding to each vertex in g and in which edge disjoint paths correspond to vertex disjoint paths in g.

* [VertexCover](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexCover.html)[g] returns a vertex cover of the graph g. An option Algorithm that can take on values Greedy, Approximate, or Optimum is allowed. The default setting is Algorithm -> Approximate. Different algorithms are used to compute a vertex cover depending on the setting of the option Algorithm.

* [VertexCoverQ](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexCoverQ.html)[g, c] yields True if the vertices in list c define a vertex cover of graph g.

* [VertexWeight](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexWeight.html) is an option that allows the user to associate weights with vertices. 0 is the default weight. [VertexWeight](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/VertexWeight.html) can be set as part of the graph data structure.

* Vertices[g] gives the embedding of graph g, that is, the coordinates of each vertex in the plane. Vertices[g, All] gives the embedding of the graph along with graphics options associated with each vertex.

* [WaltherGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/WaltherGraph.html) returns the Walther graph.

* [WeaklyConnectedComponents](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/WeaklyConnectedComponents.html)[g] gives the weakly connected components of directed graph g as lists of vertices.

* [WriteGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/WriteGraph.html)[g, f] writes graph g to file f using an edge list representation.

* Zoom[{i, j, k, ...}] is a value that the [PlotRange](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/PlotRange.html) option can take on in [ShowGraph](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/ShowGraph.html). Setting [PlotRange](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/Combinatorica/ref/PlotRange.html) to this value zooms the display to contain the specified subset of vertices, i, j, k, ....
