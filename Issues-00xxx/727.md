-	mailed-by		googlegroups.com

-It *is* a ternary quadratic form once you homogenize with a 3rd variable z.
-
-Finding rational points on plane conics (which is what this is) has
-advanced substantially in the last few years.  My paper with Rusin
-(Mathematics of Computation, 72 (2003), no. 243, pages 1417-1441.)
-works well for diaginal ones and is behind Magma's first
-implementations for RationalPoint(Conic());  a different method by
-Denis Simon is better for non-diagonal ones and is (I believe) what
-Magma uses.
-
-My method is implemented in the C++ code which is already in Sage in
-the mwrank package, so all tat would be needed would be to write the
-appropriate wrappers!

Here's a version that uses hilbert symbols and rnfisnorm from resp. #9334 and #2329. This patch provides motivation and testcases for those two other tickets.

This looks really good. It's embarrassing that we've been shipping Denis Simon's scripts with Sage for years but nobody's sat down and written the interface code necessary to make it accessible.

Patch applied fine to 4.6.2.alpha1, all doctests in sage/schemes passed, the ref manual built OK, and all the examples I tried worked.

I have one minor gripe: there are one or two cases where the new Conic classes inherit methods from the generic plane curve classes that perhaps ought to be replaced with more appropriate conic-specific implementations (e.g the method "rational_points"). But that can come in future tickets if people feel it's needed.
