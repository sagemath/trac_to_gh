This looks really good. It's embarrassing that we've been shipping Denis Simon's scripts with Sage for years but nobody's sat down and written the interface code necessary to make it accessible.

Patch applied fine to 4.6.2.alpha1, all doctests in sage/schemes passed, the ref manual built OK, and all the examples I tried worked.

I have one minor gripe: there are one or two cases where the new Conic classes inherit methods from the generic plane curve classes that perhaps ought to be replaced with more appropriate conic-specific implementations (e.g the method "rational_points"). But that can come in future tickets if people feel it's needed.
