The problem is in polynomial creation.

```
K = GF(2^16, 'a')
print type(K)
R.<x> = K[]
print type(R)
s = K.random_element()

def leak(n):
    m = get_memory_usage()

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

after much hunting, the bug appears to be in PARI gen `__bool__` method, which currently is implemented as:

```
def __bool__(gen self):
   _sig_on
   t = bool(self.g != stoi(0))
   _sig_off
   return t
```

which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

This is really a symptom of some sort of much more general memory leak problem in the PARI C library interface, as the following bizarre example illustrates:

```
sage: n = pari('x')
sage: m = pari(0)
sage: s = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(2*10^5):
...       _ = pari(0)
...
sage: print get_memory_usage() - s
0.0
sage: n = pari('x')
sage: m = pari(0)
sage: s = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(2*10^5):
...       _ = n == m
...
sage: print get_memory_usage() - s
0.0
sage: n = pari('x')
sage: m = pari(0)
sage: s = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(2*10^5):
...       _ = n == pari(0)
...
sage: print get_memory_usage() - s
10.87109375
