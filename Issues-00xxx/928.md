```
If you pass

```
 --instr-atstart=no
```
to callgrind profiling is disabled until you tell callgrind via 

```
callgrind-control
```
to turn on profiling. After you have finished profiling your code you can use callgrind-contorl again to turn profiling off again. This can be very useful because if you only want to profile certain bits and also saves potentially a whole lot of time if it takes a long time to get to the part of the computation you want to profile.

Carl Witty suggested this in #sage-devel yesterday.

Cheers,

Michael
