NOTE:

The old partitions function (copied below), was vastly faster than the new
Partitions(n).list() for n=30...

```
def partitions(n):
    r"""
    Generator of all the partitions of the integer $n$.

    INPUT:
        n -- int

    To compute the number of partitions of $n$ use
    \code{number_of_partitions(n)}.

    EXAMPLES:
        sage.: partitions(3)
        <generator object at 0xab3b3eac>
        sage: list(partitions(3))
        [(1, 1, 1), (1, 2), (3,)]

    """
    n == ZZ(n)
    # base case of the recursion: zero is the sum of the empty tuple
    if n == 0:
        yield ( )
        return
    # modify the partitions of n-1 to form the partitions of n
