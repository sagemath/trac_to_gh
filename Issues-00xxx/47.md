It's "from sage.all import *".  But then I'm being dumb, since that
just turns the preparser back on. 

The preparser in SAGE is activated in misc/interpreter.py in this line:

\# Rebind this to be the new IPython prefilter:
InteractiveShell.prefilter = sage_prefilter

If you comment that one line out, then restart SAGE (with sage -br) you'll 
get a SAGE that has no preparsing at all by default.  Yet all the library
code
should work fine and you have the sage library functions available by
default.

That sounds reasonable. I undid the preparser.py change and commented out the
suggested line in interpreter.py. With a few basic tests everything seems OK.

I guess the default int is now a Python int, but that is okay for what I'm working on
right now. 

Thanks for sorting this out.

Component: **basic arithmetic**

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

This has been possible for a while now:

```
sage: preparser(False)
sage: 2^2
0
sage: preparser(True)
sage: 2^2
4
```
Hence I am closing the ticket.

Cheers,
