sloccount measures the total numbers of lines in a project and estimates the time as well as amount of money needed to create the project. It also creates nice html output - for an example see

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/2.8.9.rc1-sloccount.html

It would be nice to have an optional script that would automatically create the output for the whole sage project.

Cheers,

Michael

To include the GAP code which is written in GAP, you need to count the lines in the *.gi files
as well. I don't know if you can exclude all lines beginning with a # or not (these would be
comments or documentation).
