Doing a startup + quit with Sage 2.8.4.2 leads to five of the following:

```

==8222==    by 0x49CB7D: import_module_level (import.c:2002)
```
We should only instantiate one pari instance, so the following culprits ought to import the global pari instance:

```
rings/real_mpfr.pyx:        cdef PariInstance P
rings/real_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P = sage.libs.pari.gen.pari
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P = sage.libs.pari.gen.pari
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P
```
This saves about 2.5 MB of memory.

Cheers,

Well, as it turned out the pari only instantiates its stack ones. The problem is caused by some reference not being freed, so it is very likely a Cython issue.

This is no longer a problem in Sage 3.1.1, so close it as fixed. Who fixed it we will never know :)
