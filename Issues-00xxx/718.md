Doing a startup + quit with Sage 2.8.4.2 leads to five of the following:

```
==8222== 524,288 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1,983 of 1,998
==8222==    at 0x4A1BB35: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:207)

==8222==    by 0x49CB7D: import_module_level (import.c:2002)
```
We should only instantiate one pari instance, so the following culprits ought to import the global pari instance:

```
rings/real_mpfr.pyx:        cdef PariInstance P
rings/real_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P = sage.libs.pari.gen.pari
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P = sage.libs.pari.gen.pari
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P
rings/complex_double.pyx:        cdef sage.libs.pari.gen.PariInstance P
```
This saves about 2.5 MB of memory.

Cheers,

Michael

Well, as it turned out the pari only instantiates its stack ones. The problem is caused by some reference not being freed, so it is very likely a Cython issue.
