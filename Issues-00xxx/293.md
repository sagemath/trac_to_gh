It appears that `FAST_SEQ_UNSAFE` creates a new reference to the list but never releases it.

It might be because `PySequence_Fast` returns a new reference, but `PySequence_Fast_ITEMS` doesn't release it.

Now that we have fast list indexing, there should be very few instances where we need to use this macro...

Confirmed.  This is a *major* memory leak

```
[18:35] <william> indeed!
[18:35] <william> david harvey is totally right about that memory leak!
[18:35] <william> Try the following two distinct blocks of code, where m = get_memory_usage
[18:35] <william> print m()
[18:35] <william> n = random_matrix(RR, 200) 
[18:35] <william> n.set_immutable()
[18:35] <william> hash(n)
[18:35] <william> del n
[18:35] <william> m()
[18:35] <william>   -- and --
[18:35] <william> print m()
[18:35] <william> n = random_matrix(RR, 200) 
[18:35] <william> n.set_immutable()
[18:35] <william> del n
[18:35] <william> m()
[18:36] <william> The first leaks about 3MB every time.  The second doesn't leak at all.
[18:36] <robertwb> ouch
[18:36] <robertwb> yes, it's a new reference (though it may or may not be a new object)


print m()
n = random_matrix(RR, 200) 
n.set_immutable()
hash(n)
del n
m()
```
