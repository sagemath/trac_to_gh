The GMP development page
   http://gmplib.org/devel/
has some code for fast GCD/XGCD of huge operands. It might not appear for a while in official releases, but they claim it's stable, and I'm interested in patching it into SAGE. I tried to do this and got stuck on configuration problems that a linux/GNU guru could help with.

I tried for a while to get the patch to work.  I think it doesn't work against
the latest GMP release (plain vanilla), which is newer than the last change of that patch:

```

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/was/sage2.8/sage-2.8/spkg/build/gmp-4.2.1.p9/src'
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

This isn't a problem with autoconf, etc.,  -- it s  a problem with the patch simply not working.

Well no, I *did* actually get the patch compiling in a standalone setting, after manually fiddling with autoconf (etc) output files. But I couldn't get it compiling in SAGE, now I can't quite remember why.

It might help to check out the doc/configuration file in GMP, which explains in some detail how to add new files to GMP.

I've attached an initial patch which I believe puts all the right files and new lines of code in the right places. I haven't tried building yet. Apply this patch by `patch -p1 < gcd1.patch` in the gmp-4.2.1 directory.
