Hi William,
 
SAGE is great!  Long live SAGE!  Now a bug report 
 
Integers(2**31)(5) hangs on my Linux box.
 
Bug information: Integers(2**30)(5) works, Integers(2**31-1)(5) works, but
there's an ugly range after 2**31.  The offending code is in
integer_mod.pyx, but I can't debug it much further.  Here's a gdb
backtrace, which looks a little sparse:

Machine information:
 
It hangs under my Linux box:
 
$ uname -a
Linux tumor 2.6.10-1.9_FC2 #1 Thu Jan 13 17:54:57 EST 2005 i686 i686 i386
GNU/Linux
 
But works fine on the SAGE notebook hosted at modular and works fine on
SAGE 1.3.7 on my Mac OS X G4 Powerbook.
 
Sage information:  Fails under two versions, both built from source:
 
bash-2.05b$ ./sage

and
 
bash-2.05b$ ./sage
--------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 1.4, Build Date: 2006-10-05             |
| Distributed under the GNU General Public License V2. |
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Thanks for the great work on SAGE, it is now my CAS of choice.
Nick Alexander
 
PS.  A question: how does @func_persist work, meaning where does it get
translated and into what code.  Is this mechanism general and used
elsewhere?

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

GMP doesn't have mpz_t --> long long functions, so it can only deal with the first 32 bits of the integer on 32 bit platforms. At most I need the 33rd bit, so this patch lowers the bound to use gmp in these cases.

The lower bound (2^31-1) is only a factor of sqrt(2) lower than the highest possible bound (sqrt(2^63-1)) for this class, so this does not affect efficency a very large of a range.

The crash was a div by zero error--gmp was trying to compute 5 mod 0.
