Here's a test case.  First I define a function:

```
sage: def foo(x):
....:     return x+3
....: 
```

Then I copy/paste the above session:

```
sage: sage: def foo(x):
....:     ....:     return x+3
------------------------------------------------------------
<type 'exceptions.IndentationError'>: expected an indented block (<ipython console>, line 2)
