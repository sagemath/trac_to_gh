There are three failures, but the last two are direct consequences of the first one:

```

This function was in 2.8.6 but is no longer in 2.8.7.  Was it deliberately removed?

This was caused by David Roe's refactoring of the ell_rational_field command.
Now one does L = E.Lseries(), and there is a method
    L.values_along_line(...)
