Consider:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,8,'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: I.groebner_basis() # calls Singular and takes a long time
```

Now press Ctrl-C and you'll get:

```
Interrupting Singular...
Interrupting Singular...
...
<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: Restarting Singular 
(WARNING: all variables defined in previous session are now invalid)
```

Singular supposedly got killed but keeps running in background.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I think this is fixed in current Sage due to the signal handler rewrite by Gonzalo and William.

Cheers,
