* Building optional packages under OS X Intel (status report on 08-25-06 by William Stein)
   Everything works except the following --
      * dvipng doesn't build (but shouldn't be needed, since this comes with tex)
      * RealLib3 -- fails with "LongFloat.cpp:6:20: error: malloc.h: No such file or directory"
      * numpy-2006-08-16.spkg -- fails with "KeyError: 'linker_exe'"
      * scipy-2006-08-16.spkg -- depends on numpy
      * soya-0.11.2.p0.spkg -- fails to find GL/glew.h  (soya is probably very hard to build in OSX...)
