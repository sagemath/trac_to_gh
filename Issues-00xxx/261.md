Kyle Schalm suggests:

```
 
 
here is a matrix constructor i would like to see:
 
Matrix(M, N, f):
   for i in range(1,M+1):
     for j in range(1,N+1):
       self[i][j] = f(i,j)   # or whatever the syntax is
 
 
i might use it like this:
 
A = Matrix(3, 3, lambda i,j: i+j)
 
i'd do it myself, but i don't have a development environment set up,
and don't wanna do that right now.
 
cheers,
kyle

On my system seems to be working fine. A light cosmetic suggestion for the patch - I would use 'import numpy' only once, at the very beginning. 

A desirable thing is to adjust 'vector' correspondingly - both vorking as 'vector(3,f)' and 'vector(v)' for a 1-dimensional numpy array v with dtype=int, dtype=object or any other dtype, which possible currently to do as 'vector(list(v))'. I'll try to add this as a ticket later (when I'll have more time) if it won't be created earlier.
