Kyle Schalm suggests:

```
 
 
here is a matrix constructor i would like to see:
 
Matrix(M, N, f):
   for i in range(1,M+1):
     for j in range(1,N+1):
       self[i][j] = f(i,j)   # or whatever the syntax is
 
 
i might use it like this:
 
A = Matrix(3, 3, lambda i,j: i+j)
 
i'd do it myself, but i don't have a development environment set up,
and don't wanna do that right now.
 
cheers,
kyle
