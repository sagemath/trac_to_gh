I've succeded in creating a gp2c package (for gp2c-0.0.5pl6), that I'm uploading. In order for the script gp2c-run to work, it is needed a miror modification to the pari package so that the file pari.cfg gets installed.

I will try to do the integration with Sage, next (probably more difficult)

I've upload it to

http://pdenapo.googlepages.com/gp2c-0.0.5pl6.spkg

I'm submitting also the correspondig spkg-install file.

Here is my modified pari package:

http://pdenapo.googlepages.com/pari-2.3.3.p1.spkg

I'm submitting also: the patch needed for modifying spkg-install

Note: gp2c uses perl for compilation, if found. It would be possible to pass --with-perl=no
parameter to configure, if we don't want that (and use the precompiled descriptions for pari-2.3)

I agree with him in that his is a better solution since gp2c needs some changes in Pari (installing configuration file), and includes precompiled descriptions for an specific version of pari). 

This new version uses --with-perl=no when compiling gp2c (used precompiled descriptions for pari-2.3)

I also have included a README.Sage file explaning this.

Attachment: **[README.Sage.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket258/README.Sage.gz)**

I submit a patch for the integration of gp2c into sage

This patch implements two functions for the Gp object:  gp2c_compile_file and gp2c

The first one compiles a file using gp2c-run and load its into the instance 
of the Gp intepreter asociated to the Gp object.
(is like the ceval function proposed in the description at the begining, but I think that
gp2c would be a better name). Also note that you cannot use it to evaluate arbitrary gp
expressions, just to define functions (in a syntax valid for gp2c, for example: avoid C identifiers)

You can use it to do something like:

G=Gp()
G.gp2c('f(x)=2*x')
G.eval('f(2)')
'4'

The second one takes a string, save it to a temporary file and compiles it using 
gp2c_compile_file

The temporary files are deleted when the Gp object is destroyed.

(This patch also generalizes the function delete_tmpfiles() from misc/misc.py
since I need it to delete the temporary files that gp2c patch creates)

One issue I see is that you can load modules in GP but not unload them.

I do not think it is necessary to merge pari and gp2c. If you install
PARI properly (with make install), you get all the files needed for
compiling GP2C:
$prefix/lib/pari/pari.cfg
$prefix/share/pari/pari.desc
There is no need to change PARI itself, you just need to add a
dependency to GP2C.
Since PARI and GP2C have very different release schedule, merging
them will cause you unnecessary trouble.

Cheers,
Bill.

About merging pari and gp2c: is like you prefer, my first idea was to have two separate
packages (my integration patch works with whatever aproach you choose)

Michael told me that integrating them could be better, to have less packages.
(and since if we put gp2c as unstable package, there is no way in which it can trigger a pari 
package update _which would be needed since it expects the pari.cfg to be installed)

However, keeping two separeted packages could make easier to update them when a new 
version of one of them is released, since as Bill says they have a very different release
schedule. Perhaps it is better to follow his advice.

About unloading modules, I don't know if that would be possible. Loading is implemented using
the "install" function in gp, is there a function like uninstall in Gp?

This has been sitting around for way too long, so let's sort it out soon. I am making myself editor of this ticket.

Cheers,

I installed this with no problem, tried the examples and some of my own and it seems to work fine.  I only tried one-liners.

I have a lot of gp experience and also some with gp2c.

I think it would be excellent to have this in Sage.  +1

Hi,

I have deleted the spkgs as attachment and instead linked them in the ticket description. I consider John's review a positive one, so I am changing the subject here. But we need a formal vote on sage-devel to get gp2c into the core of Sage.

Cheers,

Michael

As someone who originally voted for this, let me say that I am happy not to proceed with it.  There are very few gp scripts Sage uses now anyway.  The point about gp2c is that with it you can convert gp functions into pari library functions.  But the best way to do that anyway would be for the gp script's author to do it outside of Sage, as the result is a C program which can be compiled and linked with the pari library and then used in Sage.  There's no need for Sage itself to have gp2c.

Do you still stand by that opinion?

One advantage would be calling GP scripts using the PARI library interface instead of GP.

See also #15809.
