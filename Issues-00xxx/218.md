Hmm, the implementation is certainly there, but the question is how much this can be optimized. Being more specific what needs/should be done would also be helpful.

[03:05] <mabshoff> wstein: I think #218 is invalid since it is way to unspecific.
[03:06] <wstein> We already did that long ago.
[03:06] <wstein> Robertwb did most of the work.
[03:06] <mabshoff> ok, close it?
[03:06] <wstein> Yes.  And credit it to Robertwb :-)
[03:06] <wstein> (and david harvey and me)
[03:07] <mabshoff> close it as fixed against the current milestone mentioning it was done a while ago.
[03:07] <mabshoff> Actually, I will just paste this part of the log ;)
