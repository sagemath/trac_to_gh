It would also be good to check any .pxi files that are included. Maybe even any .h files that are referenced, because the C file compilation will depend on this too.

I've made a change so when you do a "sage -upgrade" all .pyx files get rebuilt.  This is obviously slower, but will avoid a lot of stupid confusion for now.

* Checking for dependencies on .h files doesn't work at all.

* Recursive dependencies don't work, i.e., if a depends on b and b on c, and
c changes, then a isn't rebuilt.
