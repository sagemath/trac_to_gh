If you type a loop at the sage prompt:

```
----------------------------------
sage: for i in range(1,3):
   ...:     print i
   ...:
1
2
----------------------------------
```

and then do an "arrow up" key, it seems like the loop is recalled. However, it seems only the first line is actually still there:

```
-----------------------------------------
sage: for i in range(1,3):
    print i
   ....:     print "done"
   ....:
done
done
-----------------------------------------
```

In straight Ipython this problems doesn't happen.  In sage it does.  Tricky.  

PLAN:
1. disable bits of how sage customizes ipython until find the problem.
