I just tested your example with what I think is the latest version
of Pyrex with all patches I know of applied, and the bug is definitely
still there.  You can actually try it all out interactively on this web
page:   http://modular.math.washington.edu:8101/leak

Is there any reason you couldn't write this as
 
   cdef void leak (T obj):
     obj.j = 1
     obj.i = obj.i + 1
     obj.a[0] = obj.a[0] + 1
 
The reference counting behaviour of typecasts involving
object references is not well defined, and you do it at
your own risk. It's much better to declare things as
having the appropriate type wherever possible.
 
If you really must use a typecast, it's safest to just
do one of them and put the result into an appropriately
typed local as soon as possible, e.g.
 
   cdef void leak (void *obj):
     cdef T t
     t = <T>obj
     t.j = 1
     t.i = t.i + 1
     t.a[0] = t.a[0] + 1

The only reason (albeit not an insurmountable one) is that leak()
would be called from C code and have its argument as an opaque object
handle (void *).

That's the solution that I've already adopted. And I've already
checked that the code generated from the last two lines of my example
is correct.

That's somewhat misleading. Each line in my example, except the
indicated one, produces correct code. I think anyone, who's seen that
the first two assignments in leak() work properly, would expect the
third one to work as well. That's why it's a bug.
