The goal of this ticket is to make number fields work when the defining polynomial is not integral or not monic.

If the user specifies a non-integral or non-monic polynomial to define an absolute or relative number field, we define the corresponding PARI number field by a monic integral polynomial obtained from the PARI functions `polredbest` and `rnfpolredbest`, respectively.

The new methods `NumberField_generic._pari_absolute_structure()` and `NumberField_relative._pari_relative_structure()` return the data needed to convert elements between the Sage `NumberField` and the PARI `nf` structure.

sage: sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2-1/2)

I, for myself would like to see this fixed. I would fix this myself if I had time...

In any case, current situation in Sage is not admissible. If we decide not to fix this then, should we allow to define number fields with nonintegral generators? This would also mean a lot of effort.

I don't know about "we", but it is a total no brainer that this has to get done eventually.   It is certainly easier than writing the number field code in the first place, which was hard, but not that hard.

In SageMath 6.7.beta1:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2-1/2)
sage: L.discriminant()
8
sage: L.ring_of_integers()
Maximal Order in Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 1/2
```
However, there are still problems; see e.g. #18243.  We should make use of the fact that when one feeds a non-monic or non-integral polynomial `f` to PARI's `nfinit()`, it returns a pair `[nf, c]` where `nf` is an number field isomorphic to **Q**[*x*]/(*f*) and defined by a monic integral polynomial, and `c` is a root of `f` in `nf`.

Something weird seems to be going on with factoring. This is "normal" behavior for a number field.

```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(x^3+x+1)
sage: F(2).factor()
2
sage: F(3).factor()
(a^2 + a + 2) * (-a + 1)
sage: (a^2 + a + 2).factor()
a^2 + a + 2
sage: F.factor(3)
(Fractional ideal (a^2 + a + 2)) * (Fractional ideal (-a + 1))
sage: (-a+1).factor()
-a + 1
```

This is not.

```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(2*x^3+x+1)
sage: F(2).factor()
(-47*a^2 + 21*a - 93/2) * (-1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a)^2 * (1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a)
sage: F.factor(2)
(Fractional ideal (-1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a))^2 * (Fractional ideal (1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a))
sage: (-47*a^2 + 21*a - 93/2).norm()
-8192
sage: (-47*a^2 + 21*a - 93/2).factor()
(3718815975/16384*a^2 - 1336872061/16384*a + 7884913157/32768) * (-1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a)^14 * (1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a)^-1
sage: (1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a).factor()
(13/512*a^2 - 11/512*a - 7/256) * (-1/2*a^2 + 1/2*a)^-4
```

Somehow, it's not controlling primes over the leading coefficient properly...
