John Cremona has implemented a wide range of height bounds for elliptic curves in 
this magma program:

  http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/jec/ftp/progs/magma/nfhtbound.m

(see also attached file).  Upon my request he GPL'd this program.  Thus we can
legally port it line-by-line to SAGE.

None of this is in Sage at all yet.  Over Q the functionality is there (provided by eclib) but not over number fields.

It's something I could do, yes.  So please keep the ticket open.
