John Cremona has implemented a wide range of height bounds for elliptic curves in 
this magma program:

  http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/jec/ftp/progs/magma/nfhtbound.m

(see also attached file).  Upon my request he GPL'd this program.  Thus we can
legally port it line-by-line to SAGE.

None of this is in Sage at all yet.  Over Q the functionality is there (provided by eclib) but not over number fields.

It's something I could do, yes.  So please keep the ticket open.

Sure. I just wanted to make sure that the ticket hadn't already been solved. If you plan to work on it you might want to take ownership of this ticket since roed is rather busy these days.

By the way, before this (=height bounds) is done we should also implement heights on elliptic curves over number fields.  For this reason I have changed the ticket's summary description as well as taking ownership.

Implementation of heights in done in #8496 so should be available from 4.3.4.

Hence I changed the ticket's title back so that it only refers to height bounds.
