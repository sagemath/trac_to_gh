John Cremona has implemented a wide range of height bounds for elliptic curves in 
this magma program:

  http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/jec/ftp/progs/magma/nfhtbound.m

(see also attached file).  Upon my request he GPL'd this program.  Thus we can
legally port it line-by-line to SAGE.

By the way, before this (=height bounds) is done we should also implement heights on elliptic curves over number fields.  For this reason I have changed the ticket's summary description as well as taking ownership.

Implementation of heights in done in #8496 so should be available from 4.3.4.

Hence I changed the ticket's title back so that it only refers to height bounds.
