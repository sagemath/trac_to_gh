Looks like a Gap or Python runaway problem.  On Mac OS X, SAGE  
doesn't die, but I get this:

This is Python running out of memory trying to read out a *MASSIVE* string
from GAP.  A solution would involve using files to communicate such huge
data.  That's a NotImplemented issue.  I'm changing this to an enhacement, 
since it's not a bug, but a reflection of a general issue. 

ENHANCEMENT: Make it much easier to get huge data out of systems,
e.g., the eval method and str methods of interface objects should
easily be extractable via a file.
