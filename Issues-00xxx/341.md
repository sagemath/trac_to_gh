I would consider this "worksforme":

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 2.8.2, Release Date: 2007-08-22                       |

sage: a=ZZ(3)
sage: a.multiplicative_order()
+Infinity
```
