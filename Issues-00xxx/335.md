From Kate Minola:

```
After building sage-2.4 on my pentium4-pc-linux machine,
when I do 'make test', I get

[stuff deleted]
sage -t devel/sage-main/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py  [Errno 39]
Directory not empty: '/home/kate/.sage//tmp/31372/'

        [3.2 s]
[stuff deleted]

The code in the function 'all_cached_data(polytopes)' in lattice_polytope.py
seems to be causing this.

Even though at the end, 'make test' says all the tests passed, this
looks like a problem.

Mmmh, didn't this get fixed? Something with NFS mounts (or some other network file system via automounter)
