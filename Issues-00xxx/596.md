When I execute

```
sage: wiki()
```

I get ...

```
* Open your web browser to http://localhost:9000
...
```
and it works fine.  Then how do I close it cleanly?

I've tried ctrl-C in the sage window, which gives the following...
It closes that web window but then restarts the wiki.

```
2007/09/05 13:47 -0700 [-] Received SIGINT, shutting down.

etc.

Closing the webpage first doesn't help and SAGE doesn't accept any
commands
other than ctrl-C, including ctrl-D.

Apparently Ctl-C Ctl-C (twice in rapid succession) closes it.

This might have been fixed by the sig off/on fix.

Retagged for 2.8.6 - if it isn't fixed yet it might get retagged again.
