You're absolutely right.  This is a bug in the SAGE notebook, or rather,
and unforseen "feature".  In the notebook if an input cell line starts
with either "sage:" or ">>>", then the input is viewed as an example
that was likely pasted in, and *only* the lines that begin with sage:
are evaluated.  (The parser that checks for this doesn't take into
account triple-quoted strings!)   Unfortunately this leads to the 
following sort of stupid behavior:
```

```
def foo(x):
    """
    EXAMPLES:
        sage: 2+2
        4
    """ 
    return x
///
4
```

```
foo(5)
///
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/server/sage_notebook/worksheets/_uniqued/code/13.py", line 4, in <module>
    exec compile(ur'foo(Integer(5))' + '\n', '', 'single')
  File "/home/server/", line 1, in <module>
    
NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
```
