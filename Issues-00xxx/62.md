I would like to have a specialized sparse boolean matrix class in SAGE which would be faster than any general mod p matrix could be. Also there exist specialized algorithms for row echelon forms, inversion, and multiplication (e.g. the "method of the four russians") of boolean matrices.

Component: **basic arithmetic**
