[11:50am] wstein2: hi: regarding #872.
[11:50am] wstein2: the new spkg definitely fixes the bug reported there with factoring.
[11:51am] wstein2: But I tried factoring in a 2-variable ring and it quickly runs out of steam.  E.g., this fails:
[11:51am] wstein2: > ring r=(0,a),(x,y),dp;
[11:51am] wstein2: > minpoly = a^2+1;
[11:51am] wstein2: > factorize(x^12 + y^12);

Upstream tells me that there is no short time fix for this issue, it requires some rewrite of the factorisation code for number fields. However, for this particular case this can easily be fixed by de-homogenising the polynomial before factoring. Patch to SINGULAR to implement this is attached.

I am retagging this as 2.8.10 which means applying the patch attached to this ticket to the version of Singular we ship. For anything else this ticket is best reassigned to the sage-wishlist milestone.
