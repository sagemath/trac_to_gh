Hello folks,

```
for n in range(10,100): a=ModularSymbols(n,sign=1).decomposition(); print n, get_memory_usage()
```
causes (among other things) the following:

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
The following code causes similar errors:

```
A = random_matrix(ZZ, 100, 200, density=.001)
B = random_matrix(ZZ, 200, 100, density=.001)
C = A*B
del A, B, C
```

The first chunk of the attached fixes these. The second chunk is useful for #561.

Unfortunately, this isn't enough to reduce all the noise MultiModularBasis makes while running

```
m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache();
```
