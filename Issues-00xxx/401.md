In SAGE 2.6, you can do list * integer but not integer * list. Either they should both work (more like python) or neither of them should work (for internal consistency).

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Work's for me with Sage 2.8.2:

```
sage: [3,4,5]*3
[3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]
sage: 3*[4,5,6]
[4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
```

Cheers,

Michael
