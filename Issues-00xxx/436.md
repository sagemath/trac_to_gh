Suppose a secure notebook is run on localhost:8000. Then presently, one has to type the URL `https://localhost:8000`. Would it be possible to let port localhost:8000 respond to plain http requests with a redirect to `https://localhost:8000` ? The advantage is that browsers like firefox complete `localhost:8000` to `http://localhost:8000`, and a lot of users (well, at least me) are used to this shortcut.

now that Sage defaults to https this might be a good idea to implement.
