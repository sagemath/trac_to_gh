All three errors are essentially the same; here's one of them:

```
File "real_roots.pyx", line 797:
    sage: str(dbp)
Expected:
    '<IBP: (-1, 148, 901) + [0 .. 4); level 1; slope_err [-24.000000000000000 .. 24.000000000000000]>'
Got:
    '<IBP: (-1, 148, 901) + [0 .. 4); level 1>'
```


Component: **doctest coverage**

This one was all my fault :-)

My original code was buggy, but the bug was masked by a Cython bug.  But I was the one who reported the Cython bug and triggered the fix, exposing this bug...
