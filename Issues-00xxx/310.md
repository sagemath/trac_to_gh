At least the latest version of mercurial from Debian testing (version 0.9.3-2), and possibly earlier versions as well, have a line in /etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/hgext.rc that tries to load the extension hgext/churn.  Since SAGE mercurial does not include this extension, every mercurial operation gives the following warning:

```
*** failed to import extension hgext/churn: No module named hgext/churn
```
(However, mercurial seems to work fine even with the warning.)

Perhaps SAGE's mercurial should ignore /etc/mercurial, or perhaps SAGE's mercurial should be updated to include the churn extension.

Or, of course, Debian users can remove the line from hgext.rc, or just ignore the warning message.
