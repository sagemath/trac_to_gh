Hi William,

I have modified the smalljac program so that it can work with 64-bit field
coefficients to enable larger computations. This is slightly slower than
the 32-bit version, but only by 10 or 20 percent. The code is available on
sage.math in /home/drew/smalljac and is licensed under GPL (version 2 or
later).

In the example below, each row lists deltas between the first 5 moments of
the actual distribution of a1 for p up to the specified bound, and the
theoretical values, which are: 1 0 2 0 5. This can be easily modified to
support whatever statistics you want - the file to be changed is
smalljac_stats.c. Tom Booth should know what he needs to do this.

Roughly speaking, on my 8 node (16 core) cluster the timings are

   p <= 10^6   <2 secs
   p <= 10^7    4 secs
   p <= 10^8   20 secs
   p <= 10^9  3-4 mins
   p <= 10^10  45 mins

The transcript below goes up to 2^36, which took about 7 hours.
Of course, YMMV.

From Drew:

```

A single-threaded smalljac module based on the design previously discussed
is now available on sage.math.washington.edu:/drew/newsmalljac. For genus 1
curves, it should be in a reasonably stable state and ready for general
use. I am still working on integrating genus 2 and 3.

I have added support for the primes we all love to hate (2 and 3), and I
have increased the allowed range up to 2^63. Obviously one is unlikely to
use the interval [1,2^63], but you might want to look at specific values or
small subintervals well up into this range. I have included a demo program
which simply sums all the a_p values for a specified curve and range that
may be useful as a model and for testing.

This assumes the parameter SMALLJAC_FF_64BITS is set to 1 in smalljac.h,
which it is by default. Setting it to 0 will lower the limit to 2^31 but
speed things up by 5-10%. As it is, the demo program runs about 4-6 times
faster than sum(EllipticCurve([...]).aplist(...)) in SAGE.

I have also modified the program to not attempt to factor scary
discriminants, so it now can handle curves with arbitrarily large
conductors, including Elkies rank 28 curve (its actually quite interesting
to look at the partial sums of the a_p values for this curve with the demo
program - they seem noticeably biased toward increasingly negative values).

I made one change to the interface, adding a function for parsing and
initializing the curve into a dynamically allocated data structure which is
then passed into smalljac_Lpolys(). This is significantly more efficient if
the same curve is used repeatedly (e.g. if you want to jump around using
different intervals). If desired, these could of course be wrapped up into
a single call, but it seemed to make more sense to break them out.

The new interface is:

smalljac_Qcurve_t smalljac_Qcurve_init (char *str, int *err);

long smalljac_Lpolys (smalljac_Qcurve_t c,
                     unsigned long start,
                     unsigned long end,
                     unsigned long flags,
                     int (*callback)(smalljac_Qcurve_t c,
                                     unsigned long p,
                                     int good,
                                     long a[],
                                     int n,
                                     void *arg),
                    void *arg);

void smalljac_Qcurve_clear (smalljac_Qcurve_t c);

The smalljac_Qcurve_t datatype is simply a (void*). See smalljac.h for more
details. The new function smalljac_Lpoly() doesn't use the smalljac_Qcurve
data type, it takes a string specification.

I have also made an effort to clean up the code a bit, removing a fair
amount of cruft, and adding some comments.

The file readme.txt contains a list of all the modules and other relevant
information. Please let me know how it works!

In addition to the demo program, I also included a utility called lpoly
which calls the function smalljac_Lpoly() to compute the L-polynomial of a

supports non-prime fields (the curve must be defined over Q, but I plan to
add support for curves defined over F_q). The function smalljac_Lpoly()

I'd say that's overkill for present purposes.

Also, to clarify the workflow here, I'm assuming that this will ticket be closed once there exists *some* way to call smalljac within Sage, however user-unfriendly (i.e., get it to build and write a minimal wrapper). Making it useful, by adding appropriate class methods to elliptic and hyperelliptic curves, should be a separate ticket.

When you build it you choose the one genus for which you build it.  Is it overkill to have it work for more than just genus one??

Fair enough, one also wants genera two and three. I'm not sure smalljac is recommended for use for genus >= 4.
