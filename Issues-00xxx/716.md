With a directed graph g
* g.to_directed() forgets multiedges, remembers loops
* g.to_undirected() forgets multiedges and loops

With an undirected graph g
* g.to_directed() forgets multiedges and loops
* g.to_undirected() forgets multiedges, remembers loops


In each of these cases, both multiedges and loops should be remembered.

```
sage: g=DiGraph({0:[0,1,1,2],1:[0,1]},loops=True,multiedges=True)
sage: g.to_directed().multiple_arcs()
False
sage: g.to_directed().loops()
True
sage: g.to_undirected().multiple_edges()
False
sage: g.to_undirected().loops()
False
sage: g=Graph({0:[0,1,1,2],1:[0,1]},loops=True,multiedges=True)
sage: g.to_directed().multiple_arcs()
False
sage: g.to_directed().loops()
False
sage: g.to_undirected().multiple_edges()
False
sage: g.to_undirected().loops()
True
```

Michael,

Regarding ticket #716, these patches were incorporated a while ago,
and I closed the ticket last month when that happened. It looks like
the ticket has been closed, but in a future milestone, ever since...

Cheers,
