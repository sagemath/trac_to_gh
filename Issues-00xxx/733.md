I updated the reference manual tex files by doing:

cd sage/devel/doc/ref/
./update
cd ..
make pdf

However, it claimed that there was nothing to be done, since everything was up to date.  I had to make clobber before it would build the documentation again.

Is there a way to have the ./update command touch a file which was then a dependency for the make pdf/html/etc commands?  That way, running ./update would force make to rerun the pdf/html/etc generation.
