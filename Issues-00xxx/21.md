We should improve and/or modernize and/or revise Sage's command-line parsing.

Two ideas, which could be debated endlessly and could also be implemented independently of each other:
- use Python's [argparse module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to handle the parsing, rather than a shell script
- change Sage's options from flags to subcommands: `sage --package ...` would be changed to `sage package ...`, etc. (comment:56 and[comment:57](#comment%3A57) list some possibilities)

no -- you can't combine command line options like that.  this isn't a bug

Here are patches.  After applying "trac_21-scripts.patch", you may need to make "SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage.py" executable.  The build process works for me with these patches.  For the standard packages, the third line in

```
if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi
```
should be changed to "Maybe run 'sage --sh'?", but this doesn't affect the functioning of the packages, and otherwise, they don't need changing.  I haven't looked at optional packages.

This approaches uses Python's optparse to parse command-line options.  If someone wants to write a version using [shflags](http://code.google.com/p/shflags/) or some other package, go ahead.

I propose the following approach, whether using these patches or other ones:

- first, we include new command-line options but don't turn them on  by default, instead printing a message like this one when you type "sage [...]" with a nonempty argument: 

```
    Note: Using old-style Sage command-line options. 

    To try out Sage's experimental GNU/Posix-style command-line options 
    (for example, 'sage --notebook' instead of 'sage -notebook'), set the 
    environment variable $SAGE_NEW_OPTIONS to something nonempty. 
    To bypass this message, set the environment variable 
    $SAGE_SKIP_OPTIONS_MESSAGE to something nonempty. 
```
 Running "sage" (with no arguments) would not trigger this message.  (Perhaps we could only turn this on in prerelease (alpha and rc) versions?  Alternatively, a change like this could go with the version 5.0 release.) 

- after a while, we switch this to 

```
    Warning: Using old-style Sage command-line options. 

    Sage is changing to use conventional GNU/Posix-style command-line options 
    (for example, 'sage --notebook instead of 'sage -notebook).  This change will 
    become the default soon.  Meanwhile, to use this new style (and therefore 
    to avoid seeing this message), set the environment variable 
    $SAGE_NEW_OPTIONS to something nonempty. 
```
 perhaps with no easy way of disabling this message while using old-style options. 

- finally, we turn on the new options, perhaps with an environment variable $SAGE_OLD_OPTIONS to use the old ones, with the understanding that any changes in command-line options may not be maintained for the old version. 

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/de30143ec073f31?tvc=2) for some discussion.

Okay, here's a new version which does this: it adds a file sage-sage-quickstart which gets run first, implementing the above idea.  Then if SAGE_NEW_OPTIONS is nonempty, it calls sage-sage.py, the Python/optparse version with GNU/Posix standard command-line options.  Otherwise, it calls the old parser sage-sage.

Still, let me know if I can help with anything.\n\n\nWell, I'm just starting and have had a busy week with other stuff, so you would probably be in about as good of position as myself, especially since we need to rebase this off of the 5.0 dev builds, which changed a lot of that stuff anyway.\n\nI'm finding myself annoyed at spkg/script, and all the little special cases that we have.

> Capital! :) As it's a large project maybe you could post WIPs once in a while?


No problem, once I have something of any real substance, I'll be sure to post it somewhere.

> I was planning on diving into the scripts dir myself and trying to work on this, but I guess it should be an order of magnitude easier for you, haha. Still, let me know if I can help with anything.


Well, I'm just starting and have had a busy week with other stuff, so you would probably be in about as good of position as myself, especially since we need to rebase this off of the 5.0 dev builds, which changed a lot of that stuff anyway.

I'm finding myself annoyed at spkg/script, and all the little special cases that we have. I really just want to rip that out and try to have a (more) unified design to our parsing. My current fancy is to introduce a bunch of subcommands, like mercurial or aptitude. Some of the ones I've thought about:

```
% sage ARGS # this would be for running sage scripts, or a couple of oddball arguments
% sage notebook ARGS
% sage pkg ARGS # this would include spkg stuff
% sage pkg install # since install has some special flags like -f or -s
% sage test ARGS
% sage build ARGS
% sage {python,sqlite3,R,gp,...} ARGS # we can consider these programs as subcommands of sage
```
I haven't fully worked out what this would look like with all the arguments (such as debugging), but IMO it would greatly clean up our command line tools. Also, this would simplify many aspects of the implementation, although some hacking of argparse will still have to be done (it currently doesn't support optional subparsers, see [http://bugs.python.org/issue9253](http://bugs.python.org/issue9253)).

I probably should bring this up on the devel list, but I'm tired and should go to bed before I have to be up in the morning :/.

Definitely short term I don't think it is realistic to make the entire startup entirely python because we don't have any python module to setup a suitable environment, however I think it would be good to still make separate out sage-sh:

Specifically I would have the root level sage script be (more or less)

```/usr/bin/env sh

"$0-sh" -c "sage $*"
```

and have `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` be a pure python script.

Are you saying that a configuration file should store the current environment? And that anytime it is changed (such as if the root directory of sage is moved) that this should be updated?

For one of two reasons:

* python may not be in `PATH` because python is not currently a dependency
* even if python is in `PATH`, sage may not work with the default python

It should store the current startup environment. It would change if the root directory of Sage is moved, for example, yes. But if a user decided to change an environment variable in a Sage session with `os.environ` that wouldn't become reflected in the file, of course.

Oh, right, of course. So then yes, `sage` should be bootstrapped in the way you described [above](#comment%3A43).

Well, some of these environment variables are conditional, so it's not that easy to have a file which works both from bash and from Python.  And I certainly don't see it as a problem that `sage-env` remains in `bash` as it is now.

> The problem with having two-pass argument parsing is that it separates the processing of arguments into multiple areas, making the architecture of the startup process needlessly complex. It is also pretty ugly to actually do this in the standard option parsing way because either you start to want to enforce arbitrary argument orders like we currently do (`sage -tp` works and `sage -pt` doesn't, `sage -br` works and `sage -rb` doesn't, etc.), or now the bash script needs to basically reimplement optparse/argparse in bash in order to correctly read the flags it's looking for.

All these arguments are essentially irrelevant if the first pass needs to support just very few options.  Things like `./sage -tp` or `./sage -pt` would be handled anyway by the `argparse` script.

Of course it's bad design to have two-pass argument parsing, but it would be so nice to keep `./sage -i` and `./sage --sh` working.

> Why does part of the startup need to be bash, other than because of `sage-env`?

I think `sage-env` is the main reason.

What about `sage -btp`? I use that all the time. I would hate it if that would become
`sage buildtest -p` or worse, `make build && sage test -p`.

We should also think to what extent the build system should be exposed under the `sage` command. For example, we now have

```
make FOO         # Build dependencies of FOO + FOO
sage -i FOO      # Build toolchain + dependencies of FOO + FOO
sage -f FOO      # Build toolchain + dependencies of FOO + *rebuild* FOO
sage -p FOO      # Build FOO *without* dependencies
```
and

```
make sagelib     # Build Sage library with dependencies
sage -i sagelib  # Build Sage library with toolchain and dependencies
sage -b          # Build Sage library *without* dependencies
sage -f sagelib  # Rebuild all of the Sage library with toolchain and dependencies
sage -ba         # Rebuild all of the Sage library *without* dependencies
```

This is all for historical and accidental reasons, but this ticket should clean that up too.

For that reason, I think we can only have subcommands for `sage` if `sage <file>` would have no meaning. I don't think we can discard this main function of `sage`. I think with jupyter, where there is one VERY common use, it's already a mistake to go with a subcommand design.

Extrapolating from that, I think that using subcommands for the `sage` script is also the wrong fit. It works well with `git`, but users really interact differently with git.

I fully agree.

FWIW, there are tools which can do this for you if your command line subcommands and options are all handled by argparse (rather than e.g. a top level bash script that calls out to python programs that use argparse for each subcommand, as embray suggested).

[argcomplete](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete) will dynamically provide on-the-fly completion candidates by actually running the argument parsing logic from the `sage` program every time you hit tab in the shell. This is always accurate but could be slow if `sage` takes a long time to get to the line of code where the argument parser is run (e.g. if it has some heavy imports).

[shtab](https://github.com/iterative/shtab) also runs the argument parsing logic from the `sage` program, but it statically generates a bash completion script which you can then register with `bash-completion` by putting it in a relevant place (if you don't have root access, this can be `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/`). Then when you press tab in the shell, completions should be pretty instantaneous, but the completion script needs to be kept up to date with the command line interface of `sage`.

If you use a shell other than bash, it may be harder. zsh, at least, is supported by shtab and to some extent argcomplete as well.

I suggest that `shtab` be run as part of the build process of Sage and that the resulting bash completion script be installed as part of the installation process. That should give out-of-the-box completion functionality to the majority of users, which would be nice. (Again, though, this would only work if the top-level `sage` does argument parsing in Python with `argparse`, and I understand that might not end up being the case for other reasons.)
