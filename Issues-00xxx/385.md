To define a formal function, do u = function('u').  Then

sage: u = function('u')
sage: u(x + h)
u(x + h)
sage: diff(u(x+h), x)
diff(u(x + h), x, 1)

To get the Taylor expansion you would do this:

sage: taylor(u(x+h),h,0,4)

-- however -- this currently doesn't work in SAGE since we hadn't considered
doing this yet.   What happens is Maxima does the computation and outputs
the following expression:

'u(x)+(?%at('diff('u(x+h),h,1),h=0))*h+(?%at('diff('u(x+h),h,2),h=0))*h^2/2+(?%at('diff('u(x+h),h,3),h=0))*h^3/6+(?%at('diff('u(x+h),h,4),h=0))*h^4/24

SAGE doesn't know yet how to parse the "at" function, so you get
an error -- it will have to be added.   [Note that I don't necessarily consider
maxima the ultimate underlying engine for SAGE's symbolic computation
capabilities -- but it does provide a very quick way for SAGE to have
a powerful symbolic system for which a lot of subtle bugs have
already been fixed (over the last 40 years of Maxima development). ]

Definitely point out lots of things like this in your talk at SD4!
