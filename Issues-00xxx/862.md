Running

```
get_memory_usage(); m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); get_memory_usage()
```
leads to

==11617==    indirectly lost: 130,648 bytes in 227 blocks.

==11617==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
With the patch:

```
==11888==    definitely lost: 549,575 bytes in 60,799 blocks.
==11888==    indirectly lost: 129,896 bytes in 133 blocks.
