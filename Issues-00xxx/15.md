I don't like how SAGE works for this (see below) (example from Fateman's mathematica review):

   ```
     sage: sin(3141592653589793238.0)   # very good
     -0.4463151633593201122015 
     sage: float(sin(3141592653589793238))   # very bad
     -0.64165348191050475
   ```
   The problem is that SAGE is using the Python math library, which is the C library, which has
   precision issues.   The fix is to change sin(integer) to use mpfr.


Component: **basic arithmetic**

I don't want to change this.  Keeping it as it is stays very clean; changing it introduces all kinds of subtle issues that could be even more confusing in the long run.
