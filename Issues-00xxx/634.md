To do this:

1. Rename local/bin/sage-list-optional to something like local/bin/sage-list-packages, and change it slightly (change the word "optional" to sys.argv[1])

2. Make sage-list-optional just be the 2-line program
         sage-list-packages optional

3. Then sage -experimental and sage -standard are both very easy.  Also implement standard_packages() and experimental_packages() as saag functions, kind of like optional_packages() right now.

Well, I haven't done the above, but at

http://fsmath.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~mabshoff/patches/sage-2.8.4.1-add_-experimental_flag.patch

you can find the version that does code duplication for now.
