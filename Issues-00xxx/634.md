<a id='comment:2'></a>To do this:

1. Rename local/bin/sage-list-optional to something like local/bin/sage-list-packages, and change it slightly (change the word "optional" to sys.argv[1])

2. Make sage-list-optional just be the 2-line program
         sage-list-packages optional

3. Then sage -experimental and sage -standard are both very easy.  Also implement standard_packages() and experimental_packages() as saag functions, kind of like optional_packages() right now.
