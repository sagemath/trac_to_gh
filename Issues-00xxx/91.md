If I start with this example from a sage docstring:

                                                                                                                 sage: f = (x^3 + 2*y^2*x)^2

                                                                                                                 sage: f.gcd(g)                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                 x^2                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                 ```
but change RationalField to IntegerRing, I get an error when executing                                           
the last line:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                 
  TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined                                               

I could of course work over Q, but I was wondering if it would
be easy to make sage handle this.

 but change RationalField to IntegerRing, I get an error when executing                                           
 the last line:
