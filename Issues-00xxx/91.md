but change RationalField to IntegerRing, I get an error when executing                                           
the last line:                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                 
  TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined                                               

I could of course work over Q, but I was wondering if it would
be easy to make sage handle this.
