For example:
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/const/?node72.html, reference to sage/modular/dims.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/prog/?node15.html, reference to SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.

This can be closed.  Keshav, I think this is WELL before you were aware of Sage - it dates from the days when there was no login process of any kind, if I'm not mistaken.  Ah, those were the days ;-)

Or what do you think?  Could this ticket be repurposed to the actual problem, and is that worthwhile?
