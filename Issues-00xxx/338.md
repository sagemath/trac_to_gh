For example:
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/const/?node72.html, reference to sage/modular/dims.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.
On page http://sagenb.com/doc_browser?/prog/?node15.html, reference to SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py would be a hyper link to the actual code.

This can be closed.  Keshav, I think this is WELL before you were aware of Sage - it dates from the days when there was no login process of any kind, if I'm not mistaken.  Ah, those were the days ;-)

Anyway, the real issue is that although within each piece of the Sage documentation it's easy to create hyperlinks, but not between different sets (e.g. the developer guide and the reference manual).  For instance, the first example is referring to [here](http://sagenb.org/doc/static/constructions/modular_forms.html?highlight=modular#genus-formulas).  But that has been discussed before, and this is too vague and outdated to be able to really doable.

Or what do you think?  Could this ticket be repurposed to the actual problem, and is that worthwhile?
