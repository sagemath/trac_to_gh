Yi,

Suppose I launch 1000 jobs like you saw me do.  Now I want to do
something else, e.g., compute a bunch of things "at another level",
while leaving those 1000 jobs (or what remains) in the queue.
Is there any way to make a d = DSage() that submits jobs ahead
of the 1000 jobs I submitted before.  E.g.,

```
    d.eval('foo', priority=-1)
```
???
