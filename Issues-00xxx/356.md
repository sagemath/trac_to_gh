SAGE should include a usable implementation of the number field sieve, say for factoring integers with up to 140 digits in a few days (??).  

Michael points this one out, which looks like a potentially
good choice to me:

```

A while ago on this list it was asked if there were open source
implementations
of the GNFS for possible inclusion into sage. I came accros these
links

Instead of ggnfs one could use msieve (#5310) or both together (see http://gladman.plushost.co.uk/oldsite/computing/factoring.php)
