From Jennifer Balakrishnan:

Rob Pollack just ported over some of his p-adic L-series via
overconvergent modular symbols code to Sage, which could be very
useful for our p-adic BSD paper.

The code he sent me originally didn't quite produce results matching
our data, but I've worked on it over the last few days, fixed a few
bugs, noticed a few more, and thought this might be a good coding
sprint project for us this week.

Here's where the code currently stands:
-- it can compute the p-adic L-series in the split p case (with data
matching what we've already computed naively)
-- Rob says inert p is straightforward, just a matter of knowing how
to call the right objects in Sage, which I think I can do
-- I've tested it against the regulators I computed in my thesis, and
we can easily produce 10+ digits of precision in the L-value!!
-- for some primes, it results in memory errors (I've put examples,
working and not, in the docstring in the test file). I'm not sure how
to fix these.

As an enhancement, maybe we could also use some of your very fast code
for modular symbols?

Perhaps most mathematically interesting, the special values computed
by his program also result in the same +/-1 "sign" in the BSD formula
that our previous methods produced!

The code is available here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jen/OMS

To run it, attach master.sage and Jen/test_run_generic.sage. The
second file (http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jen/OMS/Jen/test_run_generic.sage)
has some examples in the docstring.

Jen

Thanks for asking.  It's not yet: there are still doctest failures.  I was setting up an SMC project with this code and updated it to 7.0, so I figured I would push the changes here.  But there's more work to be done before Needs Review, which I don't have time to do this week.

Thanks. But doc still does not build.
The problem is probably here:

```

+        according to the implementation, which currently is 0 for pollack-stevens,

```
where the last two lines should be indented by 2.

You can check that the doc build using something like that

```
sage -docbuild reference/plane_curves html
```


You also used a wrong newstyle doctest continuation, the correct one is `....:`
Please correct.

Hi Marc,
> The import * commands are not added by this ticket, which only concerns .../pollack_stevens and .../btquotients.

It is actually less bad than I thought, but if I understand the import statements correctly, all of the following will end up in the global namespace:
- `BTQuotient`
- `DoubleCosetReduction`
- `HarmonicCocycleElement`
- `HarmonicCocycles`
- `pAutomorphicFormElement`
- `pAutomorphicForms`
- `PSModularSymbols`
- `Distributions`
- `Symk`
- `ManinRelations`
- `pAdicLseries`
I think most mathematicians who are not specialists in automorphic forms couldn't guess what any of these means, let alone the average Sage user...

So the new proposed list would be:
- `BTQuotient`
- `HarmonicCocycles`
- `pAutomorphicForms`
- `PSModularSymbols
- `Distributions`
- `Symk`
Would this be more reasonable? Considering that objects like `CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths` is also in the global namespace, I mean. Also, have you seen Magma's global namespace? It doesn't prevent people from using it :-).

This does sound more reasonable, although `Distributions`, `HarmonicCocycles` and `Symk` should definitely get a more descriptive name that makes it clear that they are *p*-adic objects (all of them would make sense in the complex world or in even greater generality).

By the way, I do hope you agree that having something called `CrystalOfProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths` in the global namespace is pretty ridiculous and should be deprecated...

Well, many things are functions in Magma that are methods in Sage, so in principle the global namespace should be cleaner in Sage...

**Edit:** And maybe `pAutomorphicForms` should be called `pAdicAutomorphicForms`?  Also, I guess it would be less cryptic to expand `BT` to `BruhatTits` and `PS` to `PollackStevens`.

I started to work on this a bit.

I will try to merge it. But I also found a lot of things that I am not totally happy with, before that ticket goes in. See below. There is a real danger that this patch-bomb ticket never makes it into sage at this rate. I would be really sorry about this. Here are the possibilities:

3. We try to fix all issues here slowly and hope this converges in finite time.

Right, option 1 would have been the correct decision at the start but I fear it is too late for this. Marc probably favours 2 and I would prefer 3, I must admit, although I am not sure I can put in the effort needed.

Now here to a list of issues that I spotted this morning.

* I don't think it is a good idea that `m = E.modular_symbol(implementation="pollack-stevens")` gives a completely different type of thing back. It is not even callable. Is it even desirable to have them in the same function. I would have left `modular_symbols` as before and added a `overconvergent_modular_symbols` as a separate method.

Thanks Marc, for fixing the last problems and improving the docstrings. A spotted a few last things. Now there is one very last thing that should be changed before this goes in: Please change the title line of pollack_stevens/modsym.py.
I will be running the tests.

I opend a few follow up tickets:

* #20863 : Improve documentation. There are some # mm TODO left. 
* #20864 : The caching of modular_symbols should be modernised and the keyword use_eclib should be dropped
* #20865 : General ticket to ask for improving the code so that the p-adic L-functions are as fast as we could hope for.

Well, you deleted lots of commented code and moved an undocumented function to a place where coverage won't complain about it. I guess this is not the optimal solutions, but one can deal with this in #20863.

Coverage also complains about another missing docstring:
