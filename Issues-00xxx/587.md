There problem was that SAGE doesn't like strings such as "1.0E+8*I" in symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string() , and the fix to replace all such occurrences of scientific notation with expanded notation (or at least on that doesn't involved pluses.

587.patch patches the calculus.py file.
587-2.patches adds the problem as a doctest
