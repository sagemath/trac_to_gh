On Solaris scipy looks for 

* g77
* f77
* f90

but fails to detect either g95 or gfortran. It should look for those two, but a quick fix is usually to symbolically link gfortran or g95 as g77.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:2'></a>I know how the scipy chooses fortran compilers (its actually in numpy's distutils/fcompiler).

I could probably help with this if I had access to a solaris box.
