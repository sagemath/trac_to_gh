Multiplying a mix of vectors and matrices is allowed presently in sage, but it is not associative:

```
v=vector([1,2,3])
M=matrix([[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]])
w=vector([1,2])

print v*  M*w
print (v*M)*w
print v*(M*w)
///
(4, 10)
(4, 10)
(1, 4, 9)
```
It is a combination of vectors not knowing whether they are row- or column vectors (probably good)
and that v * w has the odd meaning of doing a component-wise multiplication. Perhaps it inherits the method from lists or something? It would be safest to explicitly cast an error if one tries to multiply vectors.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
The multiplication comes from FreeModule:

sage: F = FreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: a = F([1,2,3])
sage: b = F([1,2,3])
sage: a*b
(1, 4, 9)

I think that this is wrong.
