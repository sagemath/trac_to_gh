On my P4 so as my P3 system whenever I undertake a long calculation using the notebook the polling for results takes way too much cputime. I guess it's caused by a very high polling frequency. top output follows:

```
 XXXX martin    25   0  125m  36m 9.8m R   80  2.4   1:13.44 python
 XXXX root      16   0  285m 176m 2860 R   36 11.6 204:18.81 Xorg
 XXXX martin    15   0 95860  43m  19m S   30  2.8   3:50.28 firefox-bin
```
How to reproduce: Calculate something difficult and monitor top.
