On my P4 so as my P3 system whenever I undertake a long calculation using the notebook the polling for results takes way too much cputime. I guess it's caused by a very high polling frequency. top output follows:

```
 XXXX martin    25   0  125m  36m 9.8m R   80  2.4   1:13.44 python

```
How to reproduce: Calculate something difficult and monitor top.
