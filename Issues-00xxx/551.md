William,

I noticed that the Python that comes with SAGE-2.8.3
still has UCS2.

Are you still considering changing to UCS4?

I would definitely consider making this change, at least as long as nobody
sees any major problems with it in the next few days.   One problem is
that doing "sage -upgrade" will require rebuilding every Python-related thing
i SAGE, which will be a bit painful.

Anyway, comments?

Making this change is very hard.  It means that Sage has to be almost completely recompiled from scratch -- at least, everything that involves Python extensions must be rebuilt.  It would thus be difficult for automatic upgrades. 

A test for which mode a Python is compiled with is the following:

```
if len(u'\U00010800') == 1: 
   print "UCS4"
else:
   print "USC2"
```

Probably the best solution in the long run is to test for a system-wide Python, and then figure out what its UCS number is, then make Sage's agree with it.  That would be far better than just always using 4 and leaving the distros that use 2 in the dust.

Even though it requires a rebuild of most python modules the 2.10 release would be a good point in time to do it.

#1663 certainly seems like a good reason to do so.

As long as we compile our own copy of python we can force ucs4, especially as long as we ship our own binaries with out own python. Once we get into distributions we need to consider what William commented about above using the local distributions default. 

An spkg which forces ucs4 is at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-2.10/alpha2/python-2.5.1.p11.spkg

Caution: you need to rebuild all python extensions to test this.

Cheers,

When building python with ucs4 upon completion of the install all python site-packages are recompiled, i.e. numpy, scipy, sympy and so on. But upon startup of Sage the following thing happens:

```
<type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: /tmp/Work-mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-2.10.alpha2/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/misc/misc_c.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_DecodeUTF8
```
Rebuilding Sage lib fixes the issue, but then we need to rebuild:

* zodb3-3.7.0.spkg
* numpy-20080104-1.0.4.p1

in order to make Sage start, but I expect that we need to rebuild a couple more spkgs to make the doctests actually pass.

Cheers,

Michael
