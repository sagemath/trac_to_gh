Currently, view() calls typeset() if EMBEDDED_MODE is True.  typeset() merely returns a string -- so if you want to see both f and g, 

```
    f = maxima("%e(k*x)+sin(b*x)+x3")
    g = f.diff("x")
    print view(f)
    print view(g)
```

Perhaps view() should print?

Fixed.  Changed start of view function in sage/misc/latex.py to the following:

```
    if EMBEDDED_MODE:
        print typeset(objects)
        return 
```
