QEPCAD uses cylindrical algebraic decomposition to eliminate quantifiers in
statements.  QEPCAD takes the statement

```
there exists an x such that a*x2 + b*x + c = 0 and a /= 0 (i.e., a!=0)
```

and eliminates the quantifier and answers that:

```
a /= 0 and 4 a c - b^2 <= 0
(i.e., a!=0 and 4ac-b^2<=0)
```

In other words, it gives you the conditions of a solution satisfying
your original statement.  See more examples at [http://www.cs.usna.edu/~qepcad/B/examples/Examples.html](http://www.cs.usna.edu/~qepcad/B/examples/Examples.html)

QEPCAD is not currently GPL and depends on the saclib library, which currently is not GPL.  However, both of those could change if there was interest.

David Joyner talked with Chris Brown, and reported that:

  I spoke with Chris Brown, who is essentially now the maintainer of
qepcad. Here is his response:

  "Saclib's actual status is probably a bit up in the air.  What I might
  call the saclib "stakeholders" had agreed to GPL it, but everybody
  was, I guess, too busy to do anything about it.  Qepcad's status is
  similar ... except that my contributions are necessarily public
  domain."

  In a second email, he added:

  "If you're interested, we can talk about this. Ultimately I can ask the
  saclib/qepcad folks for permission and move forward."

To compile SACLIB 2.1, right now tcsh has to be installed.  This may not be needed if the bin/mk* scripts are modified to not require tcsh.

1. Set the $saclib environment variable to the saclib directory.
2. run `$saclib/mklib all`

The commands that are executed by the above are below---looks like we don't need tcsh after all.  I think that the objd directory is debugging stuff, while objo stuff is optimized stuff.

```
  pushd >/dev/null  $saclib/lib/objd
  make  CC=$CC "SACFLAG=-g -DNO_SACLIB_MACROS" EXTENSION=d
  popd >/dev/null
  pushd >/dev/null  $saclib/lib/objo
  make  CC=$CC "SACFLAG=-O4" EXTENSION=o
  popd >/dev/null
```


To compile qepcad

1. Set the $saclib and $qe environment variables (the latter to the qesource directory)
2. run `make` in the $qe directory.

The Makefile for qepcad uses "gmake" for the make program name (it must be GNU Make).  This should probably be changed to "make" (if we assume that make is GNU make).

QEPCAD uses the readline library.

Thanks to Robert Bradshaw sitting right next to me and helping me every few seconds, we have a (very alpha and currently broken) QEPCAD spkg now.  The error is in linking to readline---I think it can't find the readline library.

The source is not included because of licensing restrictions (I've emailed Chris Brown about that).  However, the spkg will download the source from the webpage automatically.

Can someone figure out how to fix the build issue with readline?  I'm still fumbling my way through doing an spkg.  The error is:

Hi Jason,

try linking against termcap instead. Most of the time they are interchangeable. Sage builds termcap 1.1.3.

I tried linking termcap and it complained about not having rl_instream.  So I switched it back to -lreadline and made sure that I had -L${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib at the top of the compile line.  I get the same errors:

Could it be from not using the readline headers in sage, but using the ones in the system instead?  I have the libreadline-dev package installed in Gutsy.

Fixes:

* For the environment variable, make a qepcad shell script which sets the $qe variable to $SAGE_LOCAL and then calls qepcad.real

For the 64 bit issue:

```
~/download/qesource/source$ grep -nr " min[^A-Za-z]" *
db/readlineistream.h:63:    int leftover =  min(extra,gptr()-eback());
db/unnamedpipe.h:60:      int leftover = min(extra, gptr() - eback()), readSize;

It does not work on OSX.

If you need to heavily patch the src directory just ship a patched src directory and wait for upstream to integrate your patches before updating the spkg to vanilla sources. `spkg-install` also needs a massive amount of work.\n\nThat cwitty did the review is fine in this context. \n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",

It also needs an `.hgignore` that adds the src directory.

I also *extremely* dislike the `patch-cache.sh` and `apply-patches.sh` scripts. We have discussed this in IRC to no end, so no need to go into details again. If you need to heavily patch the src directory just ship a patched src directory and wait for upstream to integrate your patches before updating the spkg to vanilla sources. `spkg-install` also needs a massive amount of work.

That cwitty did the review is fine in this context. 

Cheers,

Michael

Notes from IRC conversation with mabshoff:

* There are way too many files that are being copied at install time; ship patched sources until upstream has applied the patches.

* spkg-install should address #633, it should check the error status of the make, delete the commented stuff at the end 

```
[15:33] <mabshoff> Also: Check the return status of make and so on and throw an intelligent error
[15:35] <mabshoff> i.e. if make returns non-zero say something like "building $FOO failed"
[15:35] <mabshoff> Also delete all that commented out junk at the end.
[15:36] <mabshoff> spkg-install should also be executable in the repo
[15:36] <mabshoff> And while you are at it reset the repo and check everything in again.
[15:36] <jason--> I left the CAD2D in there because we originally had it in there, but it hadn't been converted to 64-bit 
[15:36] <mabshoff> add an .hgignore and add src in there.
[15:36] <mabshoff> Ok.
[15:36] <mabshoff> So that is another binary? I did not notice that.
[15:36] <jason--> I didn't want to lose the work to build it.
[15:36] <jason--> yes, another binary
[15:37] <jason--> sage-cad2d, I believe
[15:37] <jason--> it's an optimization in the 2d case
[15:37] <mabshoff> Then add an exit(0)  before it and comment that you are currently not building it due to 64 bit issues.

Builds successfully for me on 32 and 64 bit debian etch boxes. However, fails on my laptop, since I don't have tcsh installed.

It might be a good idea to add error checking to the saclib phase, since the package goes on to build qepcad, then fails at the linking phase with a misleading message.

Here is my install log (look around line 2422):
