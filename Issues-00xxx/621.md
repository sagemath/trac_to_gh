This is caused when running Sage 2.8.3.6+malb's fix for #566:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```

I had a quick look at the code and we play with weak references there, so that might be the cause. Same applies to #620.
