I removed the # long after this doctest:

```
             sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -23737, 960366])    
             sage: r, s, G = E.simon_two_descent(); r,s       # long
             (8, 8)
```
then ran the doctests and it fails. This is strange because from the console it works fine (again -- to emphasize -- I actually have
to remove the # long and do a "sage -t" to see the failure!). 

The failure (see below) suggests too low of precision in bnfsunit/get_arch (in PARI).  Very weird. 
John Cremona is working on many improvements to this very code, so maybe it will all be fixed
by that.

John and Denis Simone in fact did greatly update this code and it is now in Sage (for quote some time).  And this particularly doctest runs almost instantly now:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 1, -23737, 960366])    
sage: time r, s, G = E.simon_two_descent(); r,s
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.56

The attached patch removes the #long.

Yes it has.  But more importantly Simone's 2-descent library was *totally* rewritten by Simone since this was reported, so that also may have resolved this issue.
