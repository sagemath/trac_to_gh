Dear William,

I have printing issues with sequences, cr parameter is not processed correctly
when it is False:

sage: s = Sequence([1,2,3], cr=False)
sage: s
[1, 2, 3]
sage: print s, str(s), repr(s)
[
1,
2,
3
] [
1,
2,
3
] [1, 2, 3]
sage: s = Sequence([1,2,3], cr=True)
sage: s
[
1,
2,
3
]
sage: print s, str(s), repr(s)
[
1,
2,
3
] [
1,
2,
3
] [
1,
2,
3
]

I get this both under notebook and command line and it is somewhat unpleasant.

Thank you,
```
