You can click "edit", then paste arbitray HTML code anywhere in the notebook
body, and it will render as HTML.

You could create an HTML form easily enough by just pasting the HTML
into a worksheet in Edit mode.  *Unfortunately* nobody has actually 
implemented a feature in the notebook that would allow for submission
of the contents of the form and evaluation of the result.  I think this
would actually be pretty easy to implement for a developer.

Implementing ticket #1322 would enable variables that allow input in HTML forms as well as other sorts of javascript controls as well, so I'm marking this as a duplicate (am I allowed to mark things as duplicates?)
