From David Kohel

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(16)
sage: g = G.random() # note random_element doesn't exist which seems to be the SAGE preference
sage: parent(g) is G
True
sage: parent(g) == G
True
sage: g in G # hangs despite the above...not sure where it goes wrong
```

**Resolution:** fixed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/243
