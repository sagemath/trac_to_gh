I think actually whenever text in any cell has changed and

   (1) the cell looses focus, or
   (2) the user clicks "save",

then the contents of that cell should be sent back to the server.
I hate entering a little comment at the top of an input
cell before a 20-second computation, and having to re-run
the computation just to record the comment.
