This may be due to how cmp is implemented (to produce symbolic expressions).

Hi,
I have some problems with the way is_zero() is implemented (or maybe
it is the documentation...)
Is this behavior really desirable?

sage: k = var('k')
sage: pol = 1/(k-1) - 1/k -1/k/(k-1)
sage: pol
-1/((k - 1)*k) - (1/k) + 1/(k - 1)

sage: pol.is_zero??

<a id='comment:2'></a>I've made some changes to how equality testing is done with symbolic expressions.

Before patch:

```
sage: k = var('k')
sage: pol = 1/(k-1) - 1/k -1/k/(k-1);
sage: pol
-1/((k - 1)*k) - 1/k + 1/(k - 1)
sage: pol.partial_fraction()
0
sage: pol.is_zero()
False
sage: bool(pol == 0)
False
sage: f = sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 - 1
sage: f.is_zero()
False
sage: f.simplify_trig()
0
sage: bool(f == 0)
False
```

After patch:

```
sage: sage: k = var('k')
sage: sage: pol = 1/(k-1) - 1/k -1/k/(k-1);
sage: sage: pol
-1/((k - 1)*k) - 1/k + 1/(k - 1)
sage: sage: pol.partial_fraction()
0
sage: sage: pol.is_zero()
True
sage: sage: bool(pol == 0)
True
sage: sage: f = sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 - 1
sage: sage: f.is_zero()
True
sage: sage: f.simplify_trig()
0
sage: sage: bool(f == 0)
True
```
