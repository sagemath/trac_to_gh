Even though we have functionality for computing zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves, the `HyperellipticCurve` curve object itself doesn't yet have a method like `zeta_function`. This shouldn't be hard to do (over prime fields at least), using code in `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/frobenius.pyx` and `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py`.

Unfortunate.

The code was excellently commented, in fact the comments of the internal functions were so good, it just slipped by me that the mandatory doctesting lines were missing. (Which IMHO are trivial to add in this patch.)

And if it is difficult to find "special" doctests for internal functions, one always has the possibility to do (another slightly modified instance of) the "outer" computation as a test and write "#implicit doctest" as comment. This serves the intended purpose (and I strongly guess neither Michael, nor William, would object). All in all, another to-be-better-documented issue.

With regard to the p-adic precision, I'd say "functionality first and optimizations later" (the patch as-is is mathematically correct :-) ), but that's my own personal opinion.
