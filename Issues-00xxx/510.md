Importing the module sage.rings.real_mpfr in IPython causes a segfault with the backtrace included below. SAGE itself doesn't report any errors in this case.

This is not so much a bug as something that hasn't been implemented -- or even thought about yet.  It doesn't make sense to just load any random module into SAGE, since certain modules assume certain other modules have been imported first.  E.g., import sage.math first and the rest works fine:

```

In [1]: import sage.all

In [2]: import sage.rings.real_mpfr

```

In short, importing particular random modules without having import sage.all
first is *not* supported at present.  It would be a good enhancement to implement
something to force sage.all to be imported or something...

This ticket should be renamed and the patch that currently exists should be reviewed and hopefully merged. Since the patch is a little old it might have gone stale, but hopefully not.

If a test script exists we should definitely fix all the problems that it detects, but those problems should be handled via new tickets.

Cheers,

Michael

I just tried attachment:510_real_mpfr_imports.patch. It still applies, and fixes the original problem reported, as I wrote in [comment:7](#comment%3A7) previously.

The script attachment:sage-test-import lists many other problems of this kind, but feel free to apply this patch, and move the script to another ticket.
