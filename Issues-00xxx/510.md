Importing the module sage.rings.real_mpfr in IPython causes a segfault with the backtrace included below. SAGE itself doesn't report any errors in this case.

```
In [2]: import sage.rings.real_mpfr

You can use the patch included in #509 to run IPython under gdb.

This is not so much a bug as something that hasn't been implemented -- or even thought about yet.  It doesn't make sense to just load any random module into SAGE, since certain modules assume certain other modules have been imported first.  E.g., import sage.math first and the rest works fine:

```

In [1]: import sage.all

In [2]: import sage.rings.real_mpfr

```

In short, importing particular random modules without having import sage.all
first is *not* supported at present.  It would be a good enhancement to implement
something to force sage.all to be imported or something...

I think this should still remain as an enhancement request, maybe in the sage-wishlist target.

The reason we get a segfault by importing `sage.rings.real_mpfr` before `sage.all` is that `sage.all` calls some initialization function for this library. From a software design point of view, this initialization should be handled closer to the place the library is used, possibly in the `__init__.py` of the corresponding wrapper. Then users will be able to import this module without worrying about importing `sage.all` and waiting to initialize many components they don't care about.

Even the fact that we don't know which initialization function needs to be called to fix the segfault is enough to regard this as a bug in the wrapper. Since nobody cares enough to look into this at the moment, we should at least keep note of it as an enhancement request which we could take up, once we have the time.

So I suggest we reopen this, and maybe resolve to `wontfix` instead of `invalid` next time.

This ticket should be renamed and the patch that currently exists should be reviewed and hopefully merged. Since the patch is a little old it might have gone stale, but hopefully not.

If a test script exists we should definitely fix all the problems that it detects, but those problems should be handled via new tickets.

Cheers,

Michael
