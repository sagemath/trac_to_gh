Add the following:

```
  sage -i -t packagename.spkg
```

will build and install the package and run whatever the standard tests are
for that package.  The tests will be run by running 

```
  spkg-test
```
if that script is in the package.  Otherwise, it always reports failure.
Then I go through and figure out what the test suite is for each package,
and get it to work. 

Have a "make safe" which does build of all of SAGE but at each point
running the tests.
