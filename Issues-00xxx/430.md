polynomial_element.Polynomial.factor doesn't
know what to do with the RDF ring.

sage: import numpy

sage:  numpy.roots?

The values in the rank-1 array p are coefficients of a polynomial. If the length of p is n+1 then the polynomial is

p[0] * x**n + p[1] * x**(n-1) + ... + p[n-1]*x + p[n]

sage: a=numpy.array([1,0,1],dtype=float)
sage: numpy.roots(a)

The factoring now works, but it depends on root finding, which currently sucks. A new ticket will be made for the root problem.
