This is caused when running Sage 2.8.3.6+malb's fix for #566:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```
and results in 

```
==8920== LEAK SUMMARY:

Well, _zero_out_matrix is not the cause, but the leaks happen down the road so to speak. For some info see

With the current release, 2.8.4.2.1, the output of valgrind for the given code doesn't contain the string "zero_out". I suppose this was fixed along the way.
