This is caused when running Sage 2.8.3.6+malb's fix for #566:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```
and results in 

```
==8920== LEAK SUMMARY:
==8920==    definitely lost: 1,518,830 bytes in 183,739 blocks.
==8920==    indirectly lost: 288,408 bytes in 610 blocks.
==8920==      possibly lost: 489,439 bytes in 1,002 blocks.

==8920==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.

Well, _zero_out_matrix is not the cause, but the leaks happen down the road so to speak. For some info see

With the current release, 2.8.4.2.1, the output of valgrind for the given code doesn't contain the string "zero_out". I suppose this was fixed along the way.

"definitely & indirectly lost" memory can nearly all be attributed to LinBox in this case!
