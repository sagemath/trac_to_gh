This is caused when running Sage 2.8.3.6+malb's fix for #566:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```
and results in 

```

With the current release, 2.8.4.2.1, the output of valgrind for the given code doesn't contain the string "zero_out". I suppose this was fixed along the way.

Code run:

```
for i in range(3):
    get_memory_usage()
    m = ModularSymbols(501,2).decomposition(3); 
    del m; ModularSymbols_clear_cache(); 
    get_memory_usage()
```
Before:

```
==29325== LEAK SUMMARY:
==29325==    definitely lost: 1,450,402 bytes in 182,205 blocks.
==29325==    indirectly lost: 389,280 bytes in 386 blocks.

==29325==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```
After applying this patch and the one from #561:

```
==15358== LEAK SUMMARY:
==15358==    definitely lost: 11,519 bytes in 2,386 blocks.
==15358==    indirectly lost: 384,464 bytes in 385 blocks.

==15358==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
```

"definitely & indirectly lost" memory can nearly all be attributed to LinBox in this case!
