On my machine, every file that gets doctested takes 0.8s for initializing SAGE (before it even gets to running the tests).  It would be nice if this overhead could be eliminated somehow; and I think it might be possible, by having a single process do the SAGE initialization, then fork() before doctesting a particular file.

This is not a dupe of #4699, but seems closely related since -tp 1 would basically work that way.

Cheers,
