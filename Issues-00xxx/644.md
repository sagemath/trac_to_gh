Both sin and cos are functions of one (undetermined) variable, and can be called, but when one performs arithmetic on them this changes. 

Maybe there should be a CallableSymbolicExpressionRing with an unnamed variable that coerces into any CallableSymbolicExpressionRing with a specified variable name? 

```
sage: f = sin
sage: g = cos
sage: f(1)
sin(1)
sage: g(1)
cos(1)
sage: h = f+g
sage: h(1)
sin + cos # should be sin(1)+cos(1)
sage: f = 3*sin
sage: f(1)
3*sin # should be 3*sin(1)
```

Better formatting:

sage: h(1)
