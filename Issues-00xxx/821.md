Change K.ideal to K.fractional_ideal for number fields.

It should be 

    K.fractional_ideal(...)

I agree.  I've opened a trac ticket (and accepted it):

I think this has been done already; in sage-2.10.1, number fields have a method .fractional_ideal(), and .ideal() is simply an alias for it.

```
10:47 < mhansen_> wstein: Is #821 fixed?
10:49 < wstein> mhansen_ -- 821 is not fixed.
10:49 < wstein> I think it would be trivial to fix.
10:49 < wstein> I would be ok with just making it so this works:
10:49 < wstein> sage: QQ.fractional_ideal(6)
10:50 < wstein> I.e., adding fractional_ideal = ideal in the rational_field.py code.
10:50 < wstein> Then the ticket could be closed.

Fixed some time before Sage 3.0.rc0: 

```
[07:00] <mabshoff> wstein: what is your take on #821 ?
[07:10] <wstein> close #821.
```

Cheers,
