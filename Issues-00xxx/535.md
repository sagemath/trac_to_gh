Unfortunately at least in the code I'm looking at right now the array is freed using delete.  Could you
retest.  Here's all the relevant code (from ntl_wrap.cc, ntl.pyx and misc.pxi).  There's no malloc or free involved:

```
    def __repr__(self):
        _sig_on
        return string_delete(ZZ_pX_repr(self.x))

char* ZZ_pX_repr(struct ZZ_pX* x)
{
  ostringstream instore;
  instore << (*x);
  int n = strlen(instore.str().data());
  char* buf = new char[n+1];
  strcpy(buf, instore.str().data());
  return buf;
}

cdef object string_delete(char* s):
    """
    Takes a char* allocated using C++ new, and converts it to a Python
    string, then deletes the allocated memory.  Also unsets the signal
    handler, so you *must* call _sig_on right before calling this!
    """
    _sig_off
    t = str(s)
    del_charstar(s)
    return t

void del_charstar(char* a) {
  delete a;
}
```
