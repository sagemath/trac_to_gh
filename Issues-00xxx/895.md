This patch needs some work:

1. It should be in matrix2.pyx not matrix_dense.pyx, so it will be available to both sparse and dense matrices.

2. It should call m.__invert__() instead of do m**(-1).      Or it could call ~m, which is the Python notation for __invert__.

3. The docstring should also mention doing ~m.
