This is bad:

```
sage: foo = Graph()
sage: hash(foo)
1033452963
sage: foo.add_vertex(1)
sage: hash(foo)
1537218837
```

`__hash__` on Graph objects should be overridden to raise a TypeError.

From the python docs for `__hash__` at http://docs.python.org/ref/customization.html :

"If a class defines mutable objects and implements a `__cmp__`() or `__eq__`() method, it should not implement `__hash__`(), since the dictionary implementation requires that a key's hash value is immutable (if the object's hash value changes, it will be in the wrong hash bucket)."

Currently, a Graph object defines a `__cmp__` method, but not a `__hash__` method.  This seems to be in accordance with the python docs.  However, I guess we are inheriting the `__hash__` method from SageObject, so we should redefine the `__hash__` method?

Here's a patch:
