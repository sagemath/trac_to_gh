I've noticed that sage has problems with the integrity of sage-
packages.

Supose that you have patially donwload a file, but for whatever reason
it gets truncated.
Then sage won't check its integrity before installing.

I would sugest adding to each file an md5 sum (or perhaps better a gpg
signtaure, but this could be difficult since we need anybody to be
able to build their own sage packages)
[in a file like package-name.spkg.md5 or package-name.spkg.signature]
and make sage chek this md5sum is correct.
[and if not, download it again]

[Most linux distributions do this somehow, for example Gentoo keeps
md5sums in the manifiests in the portage tree, I think that a good
model also would be Debian. For each package, Debian sources consists
of 3 files:

- package.dsc: a description and the md5sum of the
package.orig.tar.gz, and package.diff.gz for checking the integrity of
the package
- packages.orig.tar.gz: the pristine sources from the upstream author
- the .diff.gz with the modifications specific to debian

(by keeping separated the upstream sources, and the Debian
modifications, Debian makes clear which modifications are specific to
Debian)

I think that sage could adopt a similar aproach for their packages

I really like this idea a lot!  It's vastly better -- I think
-- from a usability point of view than having
to constantly pass around .spkg's and .md5 files together.
It will just work 100% automatically and transparently to users,
once we modify some scripts in local/bin/sage-*.

While we're at it, we should make the following work:

1)
  sage -unpkg packagename-version.spkg

which just does tar jxvf and does the above consistency checks.
I suggest sage -unpkg, since making a package is "sage -pkg".
Another option would be "sage -extract blah.spkg", or even
"sage -x blah.spkg".    Please note, sage spkg's can be either
bzip2'd or not, so that has to be taken account of.

2)

  sage -i packagename-version

where packagename-version is the name of a *directory*, does
sage -pkg on the directory, then installs it.
```

'md5sum' is not part of POSIX and so you can't assume any 'md5sum' command will exist. Some systems call it 'md5', others 'md5sum'. On some cut-down versions of Linux, I doubt any such command would exist. 

On Solaris I use

```
$ digest -a md5 foobar.c
```

('digest' is part of OpenSSL)

One could use 'cksum' instead of md5. 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cksum.html

That will give the same result on any platform, and will always be called cksum. It's **only** a 32-bit number, so one can not be quite as sure as with md5 the file is undamaged, but the probability of a file being corrupted while the output from 'cksum' remains the same is very small.

I just experimented with this a bit and it seems like a reasonable idea. I propose we use cksum, and if someone gets an invalid spkg that passes the cksum test, we can then think about using something a bit more powerful.

One tiny problem is that cksum on Solaris doesn't produce precisely the same output as on Linux or OS X; it uses a tab character instead of space. (Reading the POSIX spec, this seems to be a minor violation; it looks like you are supposed to use spaces.)

Anyway, we could "normalize" the output by using, say, awk:

```
tar stuff | cksum | awk '{print $1, $2}'
```
which should print out the two fields separated by a space. That works on Linux (Ubuntu 8.04 and 9.10), OS X (bsd.math), Solaris (t2.math), and Cygwin. POSIX says [
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html default OFS for awk is a space], so we should be safe.

I propose we use cksum instead of md5sum, along with a bit of awk as above. While cksum may not be as strong as md5 sums, it does include the file size, which I suspect would catch a large majority of download errors. I also propose we standardize the filenames and put "spkgname.cksum" into the tarball and output to spkgname.computed.cksum and spkgname.stored.cksum.

Along with the new spkg/md5 (or, I suppose, spkg/cksum) directory proposed at comment:35:ticket:8306, I think we might have something usable and workable for this ticket.

I've uploaded two patches which add in support for using cksum to do spkg integrity verification. There's a new sage-spkg-integrity-check script which gets called by sage-spkg, and a convenience script, sage-add-integrity-check-to-spkg, which can be used to easily add the required cksum file to a spkg. Once you have a built spkg, you can just do

```
sage-add-integrity-check-to-spkg foo.spkg
```
and the correct file gets added in.

I've done some simple testing and it seems to work properly. One test is to apply these patches, make a source tarball, and then deliberately truncate the file and see if things fail. (I think an aborted download is a common way to get invalid spkg files.) One can also corrupt a spkg file to see if it's detected.

Once these scripts are in, we can easily go through all the spkgs in the optional and experimental repos and add in integrity checks for them.

Right now, a missing cksum file is not considered an error, but that can be changed easily. Doing cksum verifications for every spkg in 4.3.4.alpha0 takes a bit under 6 minutes on my computer. If that seems too long, it would be easy to add in an environment variable (and document it! See #8263) that would turn these verifications off.

Please review!

**General**

I think you might speed this up by avoiding some of the 'cat' commands. For example, 

```
file.tar < tar xf -
```
can be faster than 

``` 
cat file.tar | tar xf
```
as you don't need to invoke cat at all. Do a Google on "useless use of cat". 

Since you mention speed as a possible issue, any attempt that could be made to avoid copying files, or cat'ing files unnecessarily should help speed things up a lot. Other points are more minor

On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is actually dash, which aims for POSIX compliance. I often use /bin/sh to make sure that I avoid bashisms. Although if we are assuming that bash is available, perhaps we might as well use that.

>  * Line 8 if [ "$1" = "$SPKGNAME" ] . A more portable test is if [ "x$1" = "xPKGNAME" ]. It's not essential in modern versions of bash, but is a good habit to get into. 


Sounds good.

>  * Line 16-25. It would appear to me that the assumption is made that if bzip2 returns with a non-zero exit code, then it must be a tar file. It could be a corrupted .spkg file, where the .spkg is a tar file. 


This script is intended to be used when preparing spkg files for review, so if you've just made the spkg file and it's already corrupted, that will get caught in review. 

>  * Line 27, would 'cp' be faster/more appropriate than cat? It is on my system, but perhaps not on more modern systems. 


I suspect that cp would be faster for plain tar files, but since bzip2 doesn't have a way to specify the output file name, I chose the current method. 

>  * Is there a need for line 27 at all? Could line 29 not have $1 rather than $SPKGNAME.tar? 'tar' does not require that the file have the extension .tar.

I've switched the script to using 'file', which should be faster.

Line 29 could use $1 if we changed the options to tar appropriately ("xf" or "jxf"), but in any case, we need an uncompressed tar archive to do the append.

Fixed.

Good idea.

I found a way to avoid shell redirection altogether in that instance.

> Do a Google on "useless use of cat". 


I like the advice "stop piping cats" :)  Although for simple things, I like using cat and a pipe, since I can easily visualize the data moving from left to right.

With the above changes, testing all the spkgs in 4.3.4.alpha0 now takes about 4:33 on my computer.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Attachment [trac_329.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket329/trac_329.patch) by @dandrake created at 2010-03-14 09:12:20

New patch fixes adds a "then" which should follow an "elif" in sage-spkg.

Also, I once again uploaded a mis-named patch. Please ignore trac_329.patch; only attachment:trac_329_sage_scripts.patch and attachment:trac_329_spkg_base.patch are necessary.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I think the message below is a bit confusing. I created a package and added the checksum. The package can be found here. 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/optional/openmpi-1.4.1/openmpi-1.4.1.spkg

But when I try to check the integrity with "sage-spkg-integrity-check", the script reports "No integrity checksum stored in openmpi-1.4.1.spkg, skipping integrity check.". The check in in the package though. 


```

If I want someone to review that package, what should I give them - just the link to the spkg, or give them the contents of openmpi-1.4.1.cksum too?

The script stores the cksum files in the directory SAGE_ROOT/spkg/cksum, and that directory doesn't exist for you. I'll upload another patch in a moment, or you can work around that by just creating that directory.

You should be able to just give them a link to the spkg.

It's looking for a directory that Robert Miller (rlm) created, probably on sage.math. My guess is that somewhere inside the Mercurial repository, it stored some information about where it came from, and is using that information.

You use `hg push` when you want to push changesets to another repository; in this case, you don't want to do that. I'm guessing you want to use `hg import` and then possibly `hg update` to update the working directory.

- to my surprise, this still applies cleanly to Sage 4.7.1.

- I think that on OS X 10.4 (which we still support?), and perhaps other platforms, bash is version 2, which may not support the `PIPESTATUS` array.  This is the reason for the `pipestatus` script in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/, and maybe you should use that instead in `sage-spkg-integrity-check`.

- I wonder if having `sage-spkg-integrity-check` as a separate script is a good idea.  That is, when you run `sage-spkg`, the spkg file is unpacked, producing the `cksum` file and the build directory.

 If we use the `cksum` directory, the same could be true for any valid cksums; files with failed integrity checks could be retained.

- My preference for echo statements is to have them start with capital letters, and perhaps be complete sentences; for example:

```diff

By the way, there is other work on sage-spkg going on at #4949, so one of these might need to be rebased on top of the other one, if either one ever gets a positive review...

I'm a bit surprised too.

Changed to use the `pipestatus` script.

That is, when you run `sage-spkg`, the spkg file is unpacked, producing the `cksum` file and the build directory.

Definitely! In fact, if the checksums are not added automatically, no one will ever use them. So we should certainly add this into `sage-pkg`. But perhaps we should get the functionality merged first.

Right now there's a minor conflict with the patch at #4949. Very simple to rebase.

<a id='comment:31'></a>To me this looks a bit like reinventing the wheel, or overkill.

The only tarball we *may* really need checksums for is the source (or binary) distribution tarball, and perhaps also `prereq-*.tar`, which is contained in the former. MD5 sums (and perhaps other checksums) are already provided on the download sites, which a user can easily check, though we *could* in addition do some "sanity" check, e.g. when running the prereq script, or earlier in / from the top-level Makefile.

All other tarballs, mostly spkgs I think, can be packed with `bzip2`, which provides proper checksums (also CRCs for each "block" btw.), i.e., automatically creates them, and checks them upon extraction / decompression.

The only (standard) spkg that is a *plain* `tar` file is the odd Fortran spkg, just because it contains already compressed data (binary executables and/or other tarballs).

So the only change we'd have to make, IMHO, is to make `sage -pkg` (more precisely, `sage -pkg_nc`) *always* use `bzip2`, or, even better, `gzip` (available "everywhere", or, more precisely, *already a prerequisite* for Sage), but in the case of `_nc` pass `-1` to it, which uses less sophisticated and therefore fast compression,  leading to a [checksummed] `[.tar].bz2` file / spkg with almost the same size.

(If we used `gzip`, we'd have to make slight changes to `sage-spkg`, since it currently just tries to use `bunzip2` for decompression, and if that fails, retries direct extraction with plain `tar x ...`.)

With `-1`, for the current Fortran spkg I get

```sh
$ du -b fortran-20100629.spkg*
34560000	fortran-20100629.spkg
34721464	fortran-20100629.spkg.bz2
34456814	fortran-20100629.spkg.gz
```
and for the current Sage source tarball, I get

```sh
$ du -b sage-4.7.2.alpha2.tar*
337633280	sage-4.7.2.alpha2.tar
338068743	sage-4.7.2.alpha2.tar.bz2 # for reference only
335605749	sage-4.7.2.alpha2.tar.gz
```

Compression and decompression with GNU zip happens almost instantly.

Note that the GNU zip-compressed files are in both cases actually even *smaller*, which of course isn't always the case. (An increase by about 0.5% may be possible, at least with `bzip2`.)

Unfortunately, unlike e.g. `zip` (which should be available "everywhere", too), neither `gzip` nor `bzip2` support `-0`, which really just stores the file, adding only the small archive header, which contains meta data, including the checksums we want.

As mentioned, `gzip` is (much) faster in this case (`-1`), and is already a prerequisite.

Both use CRC-32 only though, but for each block (100-900 KB for `bzip2`).

Also, any reasonable transport protocol does apply integrity check (error detection / correction), so only aborted transmissions (or defective harddisks / memory) could cause corrupted files / tarballs.

I'd suggest to make a `tar` "feature test" (w.r.t. `-j`) to avoid the explicit pipe if possible.

Maybe same for `-z`, but this also needs a way to pass `-1` to `gzip`.

Older tars don't have a -j option, so you'll see lines like this in the sage-* scripts in local/bin:

```
    tar -cf - %s | bzip2 > %s.spkg

and

    bunzip2 -c "$PKG_SRC" 2>/dev/null | tar Ofx${UNTAR_VERBOSE} - $PKG_NAME/SAGE.txt 2>/dev/null
```

Evidently, most of

? We can assume that Sage's `bzip2` is built when `sage -pkg[nc] ...` is invoked.

> Does "tar -j" require bzip2 be installed on the system, or will it use a locally installed version (e.g. in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin)?


`tar` just calls `execve()`, so the first compressor (e.g. `bzip2`) found along `PATH` will be run, which should be Sage's in the case of `b[un]zip2`.




> Otherwise, is there a quick way to test whether "tar -j" will work?


We could test the version numbers of GNU and BSD `tar` (others aren't officially supported AFAIK).

```sh
    tar cjf /dev/null /dev/null 1>/dev/null 2>&1 || fail
```
works with both GNU and BSD `tar`, i.e., `tar` returns 0 if `-j` is supported, a non-zero value otherwise.

I don't think we have to support dead old *GNU* `tar` versions which don't support both; for BSD `tar` I'd say the minimal version we can currently require is the one shipped with MacOS X 10.4.

GNU `tar` supports `-j` since version 1.13.18, released October 29th 2000. (`-z` is of course supported much longer.)

> That said, it seems writing scripts that do not use -j isn't hard  at all, so why require it?


Because it's easier (to read and write) ;-) and we avoid the usual trouble with the exit status of pipes, which wouldn't be a problem at all if we could rely on `bash` version >=3.0, but there's still MacOS X 10.4... (<flame>and its users are unable to install a more recent version</flame>) 8/

In case we explicitly support some BSD `tar` version which *doesn't* support `-j`, we should have a fallback. Otherwise I would just issue an error message if `-j` (or `-z`) isn't supported, recommending to install some contemporary version.

<a id='comment:46'></a>P.S.:

In case we *have to* use a pipe, we shouldn't do

```python
    subprocess.call("foo | bar", shell=True)
```
but create the pipe and *two* subprocesses from Python instead.

The same issue we have in shell scripts. If `foo` fails, `bar` might still return 0, so we wouldn't notice the failure.

If we relied on `bash` >=3.0, we could use

```python
    subprocess.call(["bash", "-c", "set -o pipefail; foo | bar"]) # no shell=True
```
but that's IMHO ugly (and we currently cannot anyway).

So it's better (or safer) to create the pipe from Python, such that we get the exit codes of both subprocesses.

Not that I am very invested in this ticket, but according to [this link](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/bashchanges) bash 2.0 does support this.  My oldest such computer has bash 2.05b.0(1) release.

And other examples after an actual used pipe seemed to work properly.

That doesn't mean there couldn't be some other reason for the `pipestatus` script, of course, still having to do with older bashes.
