Integrate valgrind into sage so people can conveniently attempt to debug. This requires Sage's python to be build with the configure flag "--without-pymalloc" to prevent valgrind from reporting false positives because pymalloc mallocs large chunks of memory and returns fractions of the memory when the python interpreter requests memory.
