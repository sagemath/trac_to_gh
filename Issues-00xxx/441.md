Integrate valgrind into sage so people can conveniently attempt to debug. This requires Sage's python to be build with the configure flag "--without-pymalloc" to prevent valgrind from reporting false positives because pymalloc mallocs large chunks of memory and returns fractions of the memory when the python interpreter requests memory.

Basic support has been merged, but "./sage -valgrind -testall" ignores the -testall for now.
