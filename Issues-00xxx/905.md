<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

New package with upstream version 0.8.2 available here:

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/berocal/sage/ipython-0.8.2.spkg

It works for me.

There are quite a few entries in trac about updating ipython, see #1625, #1264, #1969.

#1625 is a duplicate of this. The problem mentioned in #1264 doesn't happen with 0.8.2. I didn't update to svn as mentioned in #1969, since I don't know if it is stable enough to distribute with Sage.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

A couple remarks:

* no need to add me to the CC - I get email from all tickets anyway
* there is no hg repo in the spkg. I am fixing that
* "cp patches/iplib.py src/IPython/iplib.py" should be removed from spkg-install

I will do all those fixes and provided it installs I will give it a positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
