Timothy clemens:
Why is some code just as on
http://sage.math.washington.edu:8100/doc_browser?/prog/?node43.html
non-excutable in that worksheet?
```

Because the doc parser doesn't know about "notebook input format",
ironically.

Component: **notebook**

This ticket might actually be two questions.


#### First, why does the doc browser not parse notebook input formatting?
Parsing "notebook input format" by the doc browser can be implemented very easily; but should it?

In the Programming guide: 5. Writing Optimized Compiled Code: A simple loop example: Sum of Squares, the example assumes the reader is not using an interactive tutorial, thus, the explicit explanation of notebook input notation would be confusing because the { and } braces would never actually be visible to the user; also, there would be an evaluable input cell with the content "INPUT TEXT" and corresponding output cell with "OUTPUT TEXT" which would return a Syntax Error upon an actual evaluation.

Possible solutions are:
- Re-write the relevant documentation with explanations of notebook notation removed where ever you really want the docHTMLprocessor to make an example cell.
- OR, Leave it unevaluatable for the purpose of showing how the notebook works.

#### Second, why are some code block examples not converted into cells?
Code example blocks (<div class="verbatim">) that don't begin with "sage:" are not parsed into cells because sometimes these examples really should not be cells (e.g. ref/module-sage.combinat.combinat.html; the parts that start "INPUT:")

This could be fixed by refining the dochtmlprocessor rules for what should be input.

Could we do the following:

  a verbatim environment with both ` and ` in it is converted to a notebook cell,
  unless %nocell appears in the previous line?  In the vast majority of cases, in the
  long run, we'll want verbatim cells with {{{'s to be converted directly to notebook cells.

E.g., where below the {{ should be thought of as {{{:

```
This is how to write notebook mode:
%nocell
\begin{verbatim}
{{
2+2
///
4
}}
\end{verbatim}
```
