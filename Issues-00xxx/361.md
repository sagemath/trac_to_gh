From John Cremona:

Sorry I promised this a while ago.

This is essentially the file I gave to Magma in '02 or '03 which became
their package/Geometry/CrvEll/minmodel.m after a bit of work by Nils
Bruin and Geoff Bailey.  From what I can tell their changes are only
cosmetic (e.g. replacing my intrinsic with function somewhere, and also
fiddling with the input & output parameters to make the order of terms
consistent with other Magma functions.

Apart from that I just replaced UniformizingParameter() with
MyUniformizingParameter() as explained in the comment.

You can do what you like with this now!

John
