From an ipython shell we can switch off pretty print as follows:


```
In [1]: [1]*27
Out[1]: 
[1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,

 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1]

In [2]: %pprint
Pretty printing has been turned OFF

In [3]: [1]*27
Out[3]: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```


However, from the current Sage console, this does not work. It this a regression from our current version of ipython, or a new feature of it (then what is the replacement ?), or a broken interaction with our own pretty printing features ?
