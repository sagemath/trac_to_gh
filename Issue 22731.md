From an ipython shell we can switch off pretty print as follows:


```
In [1]: [1]*27
Out[1]: 
[1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,

 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1,
 1]

In [2]: %pprint
Pretty printing has been turned OFF

In [3]: [1]*27
Out[3]: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```


However, from the current Sage console, this does not work. It this a regression from our current version of ipython, or a new feature of it (then what is the replacement ?), or a broken interaction with our own pretty printing features ?

This was reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37477/if-i-return-a-list-from-a-function-that-is-more-than-26-elements-the-list-goes-vertical/).

Changing keywords from "" to "pprint".
