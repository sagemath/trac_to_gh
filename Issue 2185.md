# Issue 2185: [with patch, needs easy review] improvement to plotting digraphs with fixed heights

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2185

This improves the way things look when you plot a digraph with the "heights" option. The width of the plot is now more intelligently arrived at, so that the arrows aren't so fat.

Depends on #2184 and its dependencies.
