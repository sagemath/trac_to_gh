The Three.js backend creates a standalone HTML file that requires `<script>` tags linking to the JavaScript files. The changes in #22389 default this to the local standard package, since that was requested by a couple reviewers. The current ticket changes the `<script>` tags to link to the local standard package via Jupyter's `/nbextensions` directory, which you can see by inspecting the generated output in your brower's console.

If the user knows ahead of time that the generated HTML will be viewed online, where this is no access to the local standard package, there is now a keyword option `online=true` that alters the `<script>` tags to use a publicly available content delivery network (CDN). If you know you will publish a notebook, you can add that keyword to a dictionary of options for all 3D plots.

If the notebook publishing site has an equivalent to `/nbextensions`, then you could alternately copy the two JavaScript files to a directory `/threejs` under it and things would work, but you probably aren't given access like that to their server.

A third option (but a bit messier) is to add two sets of `<script>` tags to the generated HTML. Then the page would fall back on the CDN when the local standard package is unavailable. That would make your notebook publishing process work transparently, but would quietly add a possible "leak" to the Internet that another reviewer wanted me to avoid. Is it worth doing this rather than use the `online=true` keyword?

I can go either way on this, and in fact I really prefer just using the CDN all the time. Input from others would be appreciated.

Even if you know that and have added `online=True` everywhere, this becomes very annoying if you work on the notebook and for some reason you don't have any internet connection.

Then the question arises as to whether to do this in all cases or just for the Jupyter notebooks. That is:

1) Remove the `online` keyword and always provide two sets of tags in all generated content. For command-line users this would potentially expose some local file system information without their knowledge, but would make the HTML files immediately portable.

2) Keep the `online` keyword to allow command-line users to explicitly generate public online files without any local computer information embedded, but have the two-set fallback for Jupyter notebook users. The `/nbextensions` link is generic and reveals nothing about the local computer.

I favor the latter. And for future reference, can Sage legacy notebooks be published in the same way or do they always stay on the local server?

Yes, this seems a good idea.

Since Jupyter will be the default notebook soon (Sage 8.0, immediately after Sage 7.6), with a converter from legacy notebooks, I don't see the point in publishing legacy notebooks. But probably, this should be discussed in another ticket.

Sorry for not looking at this closer when it was still for review.

I very much dislike the logic for generating different files relying on instance check of the backend. These backend-specific things should be written in the backend files and pulled via the same methods here. So I would very much like to get rid of this line

```
backend = get_display_manager()._backend
```
together with dependent ones and instead have something like

```
scripts = get_display_manager().threejs_scripts(options['online'])
```
with default behaviour of serving CDN links for `True` and failing for `False` but letting individual backends override `False` however they wish. In particular it will allow me to has [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) backend do what is needed without making tweaks to Sage itself. Thoughts?

I think this is harmless; it seems to occur anytime a comment is added to a closed ticket.

Point well taken. Discussion moved to #22670.

After these changes threejs does not work any more with jupyterhub. I tried some workarounds whitout success. It is probably difficult to have a solution for both offline jupyter notebook and jupyterhub, but a hint would help. Thanks.

The behavior for Jupyter notebooks includes a fallback to an online CDN when the offline JavaScript files are unavailable. This was tested in Comment 14 above.

Does Jupyterhub block access to the Internet? Are you deliberately blocking Internet access?
