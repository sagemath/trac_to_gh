You must keep the order in `patches/ncurses-issue_9665.patch`: `configure.ac` should be patched _first_, then `configure`, otherwise `Makefile` will think it needs to run `autoconf` again.

I'm not entirely sure, but this seems to cause

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/misc/prandom.py

Looks like `vonmisesvariate` was changed to `RNDN` rounding mode. Oh well...

Positive review to your patch.

Volker: I added a patch to the spkg to get rid of the silly warnings about `-Wstrict-prototypes` not being valid for C++. Please review ([attachment:python-2.7.4.p0.diff spkg diff here])

There is a problem with (non-)sorting of SQL query results: #14477.
