Keywords: bernoulli

Leonard Carlitz has introduced q-analogues of Bernoulli numbers in 

* Carlitz, L: q-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials. Duke Math J. 15, 987–1000 (1948)

* Carlitz, L: q-Bernoulli and Eulerian numbers. Trans Am Soc. 76, 332–350 (1954)

These q-Bernoulli numbers are fractions in q, that give the usual Bernoulli numbers when q=1.

A patch to compute them is in preparation.

I believe the code implements Carlitz's definition accurately.  It's difficult to see how it could easily be speeded up.  

Just a few improvements are needed, I think.

* As in the code for classical Bernoulli numbers, the definition ought to start with the lines
  {{{
        from sage.rings.all import Integer
        m = Integer(m)
  }}}
  This allows the argument to be an `int`, which is compatible with `gaussian_binomial`, letting users write things like
  {{{
[q_bernoulli(i) for i in range(13)]
  }}}
  and gives a less confusing error message for
  {{{
q_bernoulli(1/2)
}}}

* To make `q_bernoulli` even more compatible with `gaussian_binomial` it would be worth having a second argument, defaulting to a the polynomial generator `q`.  [Actually `q_binomial(4, 2, 1)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError` at present.  I'll raise a ticket for this.]

* It would be worth citing Carlitz's 1948 paper in the docstring.

* I would write "q-analogue of the Bernoulli numbers" (one analogue, many numbers).

I have made some corrections and enhancements.

I would prefer not to add the optional choice of the value of q. Indeed, in the computation, one has to divide by `q^n -1` for many n. One would therefore had to ensure that q is not a root of unity. I prefer to have a procedure that clearly work with an indeterminate q.

Note that my principal aim is speed.

Just a few trivia:

```
Bernoulli number `B_n`
```
needs to be 

```
Bernoulli number `B_m`
```

I think "rational function of" would be better than "fraction in", and then "function is" rather than "fraction is".

For compatibility with `gaussian_binomial` it would be preferable if the optional argument was called `q` rather than `p`.

Here is a corrected patch.

I have not changed the name of the optional argument from p to q, because the optional parameter of q_binomial is also called p.
