While this works as expected:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: solve([n^2 == 3],n)
[]
```

this does not:

```
sage: forget()
sage: n = var('n', domain='integer')
sage: solve([n^2 == 3],n)
[n == -sqrt(3), n == sqrt(3)]
```

So, either `solve` should also look at the variable domain, or better, let's propagate domain settings to the assumption list.

Hello,

It looks good. Though I found confusing that the functions `sage_domain_to_ginac` and `sage_domain_to_maxima` have the same name. The first one return something (and does nothing) while the second one is communicating with maxima.
