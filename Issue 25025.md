CC:  roed embray nthiery mderickx vdelecroix

I am currently playing with airspeed velocity to track speed regressions in Sage. For a start I would like to track the runtime of our doctests per method and see if that is already useful information.

A demo is here: https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/#/regressions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25262

Great! It's an excellent tool and I've wanted to see it used for Sage for a long time, but wasn't sure where to begin.  In case it helps I know and have worked with its creator personally.

This is the "hard part" that I mentioned in [comment:3]. Ideally, we shouldn't have to guess where regressions might occur, the tool would do that for us. I believe that the intention of #12720 was to integrate this in the doctest framework such that all(?) doctests would also be regression tests.

But that's probably not feasible, so here is a more productive answer:

1. All `# long time` tests should definitely be regression tests.

2. For each `Parent` (more precisely: every time that a `TestSuite` appears in a doctest): test creating a parent, test creating elements, test some basic arithmetic (also with elements of different such that we check the coercion model too).

I could imagine situation where I would be curious to know how the speed of a given doctest (granularity to be discussed) has evolved over time. Or where I would like to investigate how this or that (collection of) doctest was impacted by this or that ticket.

So even though having info about all doctests would indeed pollute the main "speed regression" report it could till be interesting to harvest it, and make it available with some search mechanism.

Of course this is just "good to have", if not too costly to implement/produce/store/serve.

That seems fixable.  Is that an ASV bug or something on our end?  Also, I see a few tests with `?` in the name for which there's no graph shown.  Could that be from nested classes or something?

We could improve it somewhat but I would like to have a hash in there somewhere and it also has to be a valid Python2 method name.

This is really some black metaclass magic to have asv detect one benchmark method for every doctest we have. Let me try to explain how this goes roughly.

ASV first runs a "discovery" where it collects all the benchmarks (by looking for methods that start with certain prefixes such as `time_`.) Then it invokes itself once for each such method to run the actual benchmark.

To trick the discovery into finding a method for every doctest, I implement `__dir__` on the `BenchmarkMetaclass` to run all doctests in the Sage library but without actually running the code. Instead I just print the expected output to have them all pass as quickly as possible and track their existence. Here, I create a hash of the doctest so I can find it again in the second pass of ASV.

Then when ASV actually tries to run, say `__init__.Benchmarks.track__families__RingedTree__62b2284259a21f85bd8db00b8522ad3b`, I inject that method in `__getattr__` and have it run all the doctests in `**/families*.pyx?` but again I actually skip all the doctests except for the first one that produces 62b2284259a21f85bd8db00b8522ad3b as its hash. I time every line of that doctest and return these timings as the result to ASV.

I've been poking around a bit more in the ASV source, and am going to see what I can come up with.

1.

Ideally a plugin would be able to do this without modifying any internal data structures.

3. Relatedly, there is a function `asv.benchmark.get_benchmark_from_name` which resolves a unique benchmark name to the relevant test.  A plugin needs to be able to extend how benchmarks are searched for by name.

There is a base `Benchmark` class that I believe we can customize just a little bit for our purposes, and the rest of the code is flexible enough that we should be able to add our custom Benchmark class to the list of known benchmark types (`asv.benchmark.benchmark_types`).  Ideally a plugin would be able to do this without modifying any internal data structures.  (In fact, now I'm thinking we may not even need any Benchmark subclasses if our custom discovery code is clever enough...)

The current plugin discovery process ultimately yields `Benchmark` instances which contain all the information needed for a single benchmark test (it also wraps the benchmark function itself--in this case we can either generate a function from the doctest, or use a standard function for running a single doctest).  What we need then is a way to extend the benchmark discovery process to allow discovery from arbitrary sources (rather than just searching the file system for .py files and importing them).

Sure, if you want to change that in ASV that would be quite nice. I don't want to hack on ASV itself, so I'd rather try to get the current version into a slightly more reasonable state and start benchmarking automatically through one of the CIs. This doesn't need to be merged into Sage for that necessarily. Once the modified ASV is ready, we can change the benchmarks to be less of a hack.

I don't like this part because it doesn't mix well with doctests. I would really want to write a doctest like

```
sage: a = something
sage: b = otherthing
sage: c = computation(a, b)  # benchmark this
```

Yes, something like that could be done.  Again, it all comes down to providing a different benchmark discovery plugin for ASV.
