There is a TODO in that there isn't a good way to create a matrix over `ZZ` union `oo`. By default, it coerces into the infinity ring, and explicitly working over the symbolic ring, I couldn't get the equals check to work. I think we'd need a ring for a base ring union infinity as a default coercion.

Hi Travis--

It's a bit of a hack, but what about using -1 for infinity in the Coxeter matrix?  

cheers,

Hugh

That's a good idea. It has been done.

Would it be possible to replace the symbolic ring (awful thing in my opinion) by the universal cyclotomic field (see my addon patch in #14816) ?

And how do you interact with #14816 (and also with #9290) ?

I don't like the symbolic ring either, but I wan't quite sure before about how to make it work with the UCF. I'm thinking we could peel off the necessary portion of your addon patch in #14816 and put it with the Coxeter group code.

> And how do you interact with #14816 (and also with #9290) ?

I didn't notice #9290, so shall we move the Coxeter group code there? I also haven't thought completely through yet how I want to interact with #14816 and Weyl groups of root systems.

I've split off the Coxeter portion to #9290 since that ticket already is for that. This ticket now focuses solely on a first implementation of RAAG's.

Because I think they are a very interesting class of groups (and GAP doesn't have them `:p`), I'd appreciate a review.

Would it make sense to inherit from FinitelyPresentedGroup? Things like the Alexander matrix could be interesting to have.

1) the following does not work:

sage: G = RightAngledArtinGroup(graphs.EmptyGraph())

it should either fail more gracefully or succeed.

2) there is a typo "creaing"

3) maybe the string representation could use the string repr of the graph ? maybe instead of just the number of vertices ?

I'm not sure. `FinitelyPresentedGroup` is a Gap group, this is implementation is pure python/Sage, and I don't know how to mix the two. There should be methods to construct the corresponding FP group, as well as the ability to pass this to Gap (as a FP group).

Grrr...boarder cases; I'll fix this after I see what would be the most consistent behavior.

>  2) there is a typo "creaing"

Will fix.

> 3) maybe the string representation could use the string repr of the graph ? maybe instead of just the number of vertices ?

That would be better; will change.

I've added a quick way to create a FP group from a RAAG and fixed all of Frederic's comments (the failing was actually uncovered a bug in the graph code).
