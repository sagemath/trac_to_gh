The constructors `Family` and `Set` are intended to construct an immutable `Parent`.

We equip the implementation classes with trivial `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods that just return `self`.

Parents that subclass `CachedRepresentation`/`UniqueRepresentation` already have these methods, but the implementation classes of `Family` and `Set` do not.

Slightly tricky is the question how to deal with mutable elements. `Set` documents that:

```
    Sets with unhashable objects work, but with less functionality::

        sage: B = Set([QQ, [3, 1], 5])  # unhashable
```

Should a copy be made? Should it be documented that by creating the Set, a mutable element belongs to the set object in the sense of object ownership and it is an error to mutate it?

Probably the easiest way to do this would be to have a finite, e.g., `Set` try to make a copy of each member. If it returns the same object each time, then return `self`. For an infinite `Family`, we are safe as members are created on demand each time

Ah, right. I think hashability would be a good guide for this. If hashable, then return `self` otherwise play it safe and return a copy.
