# Issue 22123: singularity analysis: raise proper OZero-exception (instead of AttributeError)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22360

```
            sage: C.<T> = AsymptoticRing('T^QQ', QQ)
            sage: (1/T)._singularity_analysis_('n', 1)
```

fails with an AttributeError, es the Python-integer `0` has no method `is_exact`. Raise a NotImplementedOZero instead as expected.

Judging from the diff, this looks fine. I'll set this to positive review once my machine finishes compilation of 7.6.beta2.
