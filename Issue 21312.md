# Issue 21312: Remove `sage-mode` as a standard package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21549

Keywords: emacs, sage_mode

The Sage-in-Emacs interface `sage-mode` is broken since IPython 5.0, see #21227. `sage-shell-mode` by stakemori is a very good alternative. This is distributed using the Emacs package manager MELPA, which should be familiar to any Emacs user (in both senses of the word "should"), so there is no real reason to distribute that with Sage or even have an spkg for it.

The suggestion is therefore simply to remove `sage-mode` as a standard package from Sage.

+1. I suppose this should be announced on sage-develop.

Blocker or not, I think this package should be removed in the 7.4 release.
