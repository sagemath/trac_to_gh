Keywords: _sig_on _sig_off

Right now, `_sig_on` is a macro.  However, in the light of future changes at #9678, it would be better to make it have function syntax and write `_sig_on()` instead.  The same for `_sig_off`.

So in this ticket, I would simpy change the syntax from `_sig_on` to `_sig_on()` without changing what it does.

This will prepare the way for #9678 when `_sig_on()` will actually become an inline function (there are several reasons why this would be better).

To further justify the "innocence" of this patch, I checked the md5sums of all .so files generated without and with this patch and the **only** .so file with a different md5sum is `c_lib/libcsage.so` (I guess only because a string changed).
So the code which is generated is *literally* the same with or without this patch.
