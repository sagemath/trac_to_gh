# Issue 10114: Change _sig_on to _sig_on()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10115

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2010-10-10 10:13:07

Assignee: tba

Keywords: _sig_on _sig_off

Right now, `_sig_on` is a macro.  However, in the light of future changes at #9678, it would be better to make it have function syntax and write `_sig_on()` instead.  The same for `_sig_off`.

So in this ticket, I would simpy change the syntax from `_sig_on` to `_sig_on()` without changing what it does.

This will prepare the way for #9678 when `_sig_on()` will actually become an inline function (there are several reasons why this would be better).

A very minor update of the patch, the only change is in whitespace.

To further justify the "innocence" of this patch, I checked the md5sums of all .so files generated without and with this patch and the *only* .so file with a different md5sum is `c_lib/libcsage.so` (I guess only because a string changed).
So the code which is generated is _literally_ the same with or without this patch.

New version re-adds `_sig_on`, `_sig_str(s)` and `_sig_off` for backwards compatibility.

I read the patch, it does what it advertises. It also applies cleanly to 4.6.alpha3 and long doctests.

I've analysed the patch as well, looks fine by me. 

Really, this (or something similar) should be offered as part of Cython itself.
