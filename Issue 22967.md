Keywords: sd86.5

we should try to use `.coerce_map_from()` instead, so we get `is_injective()/is_surjective()` and friends right for `Hom.natural_map()`.

A strong -1 on calling the category (first): this is relatively expensive, not likely able to be implemented by the `MorphismMethods` of a category if you have to do formal compositions, and is meant to be overwritten. Really, if you want composite maps, then you should overwrite the `_composition_` hook.

No bare exceptions.

I don't understand why this needs to be a more generic class:

This is almost certainly a speed regression:

It does not immediately seem to be related to this ticket.

You need to properly handle old pickles with the old class.

Error messages are not really sentences (according to Python's conventions):

```diff

+raise TypeError("natural coercion morphism from %s to %s not defined"%(self.domain(), self.codomain()))

In particular, it seems like you will now get coercion morphisms that are compositions, which seems to be different behavior than before. This could have subtle effects on code and likely have a performance regression.

I agree with the purpose of this ticket and would like to see the ring morphism code simplified. However, I care a lot about the speed in here because polynomials are a core part of the Sage functionality.

David Roe and I looked at your comments.

The reason is that default convert maps do not inherit from Morphism. It is certainly related to this ticket. The type of a map changed, so thi isinstance check has to be more liberal.

David is going to have another look. There should not be a speed regression. Actually the opposite should be the case. Before the composite map was wrapped in another map, now it is directly accessible. We are going to double check that this is true.

> We don't understand what you are trying to say here. Could you rephrase your concern please.

You added two blocks for formal composite functions:

```python
        try:
            # we try the category first
            # as of 2017-06, the MRO of this class does not get patched to
            # include the category's MorphismMethods (because it is a Cython
            # class); therefore, we can not simply call "super" but need to
            # invoke the category method explicitly
            return self.getattr_from_category('is_injective')()
        except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError):
            pass
```

What I am saying is this is really (relatively) expensive for something that is almost certainly going to be implemented. If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.

In contrast, when a category does have enough information to simplify maps, it should implement the `_composition_` hook to return the correct composition map.

You indirectly took care of it in a810e3c:

Actually, I don't see how you could get anything other than the first case as `Element` has a `_parent` attribute this is checked within `Element`), much less into the second block because why would it have a meaningful `.parent()` method in that case? If there is such a class out there, then it is a bug IMO and should be fixed to initialize `Element`. So I would probably just do

```python

unless you want something that returns a `TypeError` or `NotImplementedError` to not be caught. For that I am a little more unsure.

That smells a little like you have encountered a bug and something really should be returning a `RingMap_lift`. Either that or we should also remove `RingMap_lift` with some more generic class for lifts (if that is what we decide to do, we can do that here or on a followup).

That does not seem possible. If the ring homset has no zero, then is relatively expensive because of the throwing and catching of an error and is something done every time. If there is a zero map, then it should only affect the first time it is called, but then it has to do a comparison because of the default `Element.__nonzero__`. What were the cases you tested?

I do not see why this needs to be reduced to `Map` but for `RingMap`, it can still be passed in a `Morphism`. If you're sure that this is okay, then I will take your word for it because I don't know that area of the codebase so well.

You should use lower case for the initial letters and not have a period (full stop) at the end. Even if this differs with the rest of the file, we are trying to follow Python conventions.

You should be correct as no parent implements a custom `coerce`. However, this does mean we have to be more liberal with types (see above).

I do not understand how this relates to `_composition_`. The point here is simply that in the category of Rings, a morphism that has a field as its domain, knows that it is injective. However, we can not so easily turn the composition into one morphism.

Yes, we should remove `RingMap_lift`. I don't remember the details but changing this type was not a hack to get things to compile.

Sorry, I had misread your initial comment. There is probably a speed regression but when would this possibly be relevant (i.e., when do you create lots of rings and check that morphisms between them are nonzero? without knowing that you are talking about rings.)

`ZZ.hom(ZZ)` is an `IdentityMorphism` now which does not have an `inverse_image()` method. We went from `NotImplementedError` to `AttributeError` it seems.

I don't have a use case for it, but I do not see the point in deliberately introducing a regression by removing code that is (was?) working perfectly well. Someone might have a use case for it; I know people create lots of polynomial rings over finite fields as the field size varies, and they might be doing a check for a nonzero map in that code.

So this really is a subtle backwards incompatible change. Hopefully nobody was just catching the `NotImplementedError`. I don't think there is any (reasonable) way to put a deprecation and/or get around that.

This test is also not valid because `Zp` is a class, not a parent.

Actually, that brings up another question, not just that you need to handle old pickles, but do we want to have a small deprecation class for `RingHomomorphism_coercion`? This is an implementation detail, but it is something publicly documented. So someone might have code that uses this class and that code would just break upon upgrade.

No, you cannot get `_parent` in a Sage session as it is a C(ython) variable. However, within Cython code this should not be a problem.

I think we should create a followup ticket to remove `RingMap_lift`, since I think it will take a nontrivial amount of work.

Someone might have a use case for it; I know people create lots of polynomial rings over finite fields as the field size varies, and they might be doing a check for a nonzero map in that code.

If you're creating polynomial rings over finite fields, then the morphism can never be zero so you won't be calling this code.  The only time you can have a zero morphism is if the codomain is the zero ring.  It seems unlikely that you're going to be testing this enough that the difference between `200ns` and `20µs`

The benefit is that we are now able to use a general framework for morphisms between rings that don't inherit from `RingHomomorphism`, for example the coercion map from `ZZ` to `QQ`.  In my opinion, this is valuable enough to merit the speed regression in this case.

Finally, Julian and I talked about it and we don't see an easy way to add the custom code back in.  Since `__nonzero__` is a double underscore method, we can't use `cached_method` there, and you can't productively use `cached_method` on `zero` since it won't cache the fact that it raised an error.  Moreover, if we try to implement this in the category, then in order to  hook code into `__nonzero__` we have to make it slower for all other elements, which doesn't seem reasonable.

I don't see a way to deprecate it either, but I'm not too worried about it.

Agreed; I think Julian is fixing this now.

This is an implementation detail, but it is something publicly documented. So someone might have code that uses this class and that code would just break upon upgrade.

Yeah, it seems reasonable to add something like


```
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
class RingHomomorphism_coercion(RingHomomorphism):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
        deprecation(23204, "Don't use this")
        RingHomomorphism.__init__(self, *args, **kwds)
```

Okay, we came up with some situations where the speed might matter.  For example, if you call `coerce_map_from` it returns either a morphism or `None`.  It's possible that people then use the result in a boolean context to determine whether it's `None`.

We'll try to improve the speed.

However, you are not doing general code, you are doing a special case, which IMO is a relatively small set of the cases, in a concrete class. Because of that, it should be a separate class if you really need that. To me, the category framework is primarily for general code that is *not* implemented in a concrete class, but can be used as a fallback, and often times, it is slow. I strongly believe that there is no practical advantage in any situation to having to do a Python call up to through the category framework instead of just letting the composite map do its thing.

If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.

I feel like for something like this you should have a generic field morphism class that knows outright that it is injective and implements a custom `_composition_` that returns the same class because it is completely determined by the image of `1`. So the composition would amount to chasing through each map what happens to `1`. If you are using some more specialized morphisms and need the generic composition, then let the generic code of the composition do its thing. I don't see the point of slowing everything else down for a special case that is more effectively dealt with by a concrete class.

Ah, right. However, you are not doing general code, you are doing a special case, which IMO is a relatively small set of the cases, in a concrete class. Because of that, it should be a separate class if you really need that. To me, the category framework is primarily for general code that is *not* implemented in a concrete class, but can be used as a fallback, and often times, it is slow. I strongly believe that there is no practical advantage in any situation to having to do a Python call up to through the category framework instead of just letting the composite map do its thing. Moreover, I believe there will be a penalty for this extra (useless) call up through the category in general; there is typically not enough structure to say anything.

> This is not an argument for removing `__nonzero__`; only for having the coercion maps not be a subclass of `RingHomomorphism`. If they don't inherit from `RingHomomorphism`, then fine, they do not benefit. However, what about all of those classes that do? You are penalizing them for no reason. Also, the category framework is in some sense a (sequence of) abstract (Python) base classes; if you need to have your own hierarchy of (C/Python) classes, then there is no need to try to force things up to the category level.
We have put it back in.

Since `__nonzero__` is a double underscore method, we can't use `cached_method` there, and you can't productively use `cached_method` on `zero` since it won't cache the fact that it raised an error.

Ok. We were just discussing ways of making it faster. We have implemented one.

The idea is not to require morphisms of rings to inherit form `RingHomomorphism`. They should mostly inherit from whatever makes their implementation easiest. So, we certainly do not want to get rid of classes such as `RingHomomorphism_im_gens`.

There are some good reasons to have these concrete classes, with some stemming from a general lack of structure of ring morphisms.

Of course we're not going to beat two cython function calls, but I don't think that that should be the standard.  There are times when speed regressions are acceptable.

I don't see how it matters whether there are other categories that can do so.  It's possible in `Rings()`, and there are multiple tickets waiting on this functionality.  How does removing `RingHomomorphism_coercion` affect other categories anyway?

`DefaultConvertMap` is implemented across multiple categories.  The coercion between `ZZ` and `QQ` does not inherit from `RingHomomorphism`.  I suspect that there are others across Sage.

Yet, the addition of the extra code to go up through the category framework in the `FormalCompositeMap` does because that is a very general construction. It is also not even possible in `Rings()` to implement a general `is_injective` and `is_surjective`; only the first one for `Fields`.

Yes, but this is not one of those times IMO.

Removing that does not. Yet, the addition of the extra code to go up through the category framework in the `FormalCompositeMap` does because that is a very general construction. It is also not even possible in `Rings()` to implement a general `is_injective` and `is_surjective`; only the first one for `Fields`. I also see `FormalCompositeMap` as a concrete implementation of a specific type of morphism, and so it is under no obligation to do things from the category.

In some ways, by removing `RingHomomorphism_coercion`, we have made a problem for ourselves because coercion maps become the only maps not to inherit from `RingHomomorphism`. We can easily make it a requirement that morphisms inherit from `RingHomomorphism` as really nothing is (currently) implemented across multiple categories. I guess my question is do you see some larger hierarchy of classes that will run parallel to the category hierarchy?

Do you mean used in multiple classes in multiple categories? However, there are no subclasses or other parallel implementations AFAIK.

>  The coercion between `ZZ` and `QQ` does not inherit from `RingHomomorphism`.  I suspect that there are others across Sage.

The `ZZ -> QQ` probably should inherit from `RingHomomorphism`. I would say any others that are ring morphisms should inherit for both uniformity and to take advantage of that code. There is no cost to this unless the plan is to remove `RingHomomorphism` altogether as an ABC (I am not sure this is the best thing going forward, but I haven't really thought about it yet).

I do support adding extra default implementations in the category, but I do not support always forcing concrete classes to make any sort of super calls, more so as the first attempted action.

From the patchbot, there are still failing doctests and the documentation does not build.

Feel free to try the generic code first and ask the category only if that fails/throws. Then again, when the category can answer it, it's probably faster…Anyway, I just want `is_injective` to work. I personally do not care about a few µs in `is_injective` since it currently almost always throws a `NotImplementedError` for me anyway.

PS: I could also imagine that some categories could quickly answer `False` when there are dimension reasons why a morphism can not be injective/surjective.

They did the hard work to fix all the doctests, everything passes, and the speed regression has no real impact on other code (you can just compare to None), and there is a followup ticket for that.   The modified code seems much cleaner.  I’m giving this a positive review.   

I’ve always thought our coercion code is too complicated/ugly, so anything that cleans it up – and this surely does – is worth it.  Please start discussing ideas for optimization on #23513.

That is not true. Checking in/surjectivity for a formal composite morphism that is not in the category of rings will be slowed down by a 10x factor as demonstrated above, and it is not simply comparing something to `None`. However, I am not fully convinced that the new code results in a speedup:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: L.<y> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: M.<z> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: f = K.hom([y])
sage: g = L.hom([z])
sage: %timeit (g*f).is_injective()
10000 loops, best of 3: 81.3 µs per loop
```

vs before

```
sage: %timeit (g*f).is_injective()
10000 loops, best of 3: 46 µs per loop
```

The reason why I am unsure is because the first time I run with the new code, I get ~28.5 µs. However, this does not happen on re-trails. Do you also experience this? Actually, when I removed the caching on `is_injective` in `Rings()` (for testing purposes, which is fair since this would most likely get called repeatedly on new maps if done in a tight loop), I consistently get the faster time and

```
sage: %timeit phi.is_injective()
The slowest run took 16.17 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.33 µs per loop
```

vs old:

```
sage: %timeit phi.is_injective()
The slowest run took 6.60 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.8 µs per loop
```

So this does in fact net a ~2x speedup for this case.

However, given the check for if something is in fields, that made me think of the following situation. Suppose we implement a special morphism for ring morphisms out of **Z**/n**Z** that checks for injectivity by looking at the image of `1` and the characteristic of the codomain (at least this seems like a reasonable thing to do at some point). Then compose this with some other map that knows about its injectivity (maybe checking if some sort of representation is faithful over various characteristics). With the proposed change, it would require computing the primality of `n` and not take advantage of the specialized code at all, resulting in a major slowdown with no clear way around other than reimplementing `FormalCompositeMap`.

Well, this argument is moot if we put the check for `Fields()` last, but the general principle holds. Some/all of the maps are specialized, but it tries the generic code that can be very expensive (maybe getting the cardinality requires iterating over the entire (large) object, but it is free as an `R`-module).

> The modified code seems much cleaner.  I’m giving this a positive review.   

The `git blame` above is not that relevant to the code I am referring to in `FormalCompositeMorphism`. That added code is the only issue that I (currently) have with this ticket.

What about my comment about undoing the deprecation on `is_RingHomomorphism`?

I can think of some cases where not having the `FormalCompositeMap` call up to the category results in errors being raised that otherwise would not. Specifically, if one of the maps in the formal composition being something that cannot say anything. So it is good to have it in there, but I strongly believe it should not be called first. Instead, it should be the fallback.

> I’ve always thought our coercion code is too complicated/ugly, so anything that cleans it up – and this surely does – is worth it.  Please start discussing ideas for optimization on #23513.

I agree that removing the `RingHomomorphism_coercion` does simplify the coercion code. However, my objection is to the code added to `FormalCompositeMap`, which makes things more complicated IMO. I can at least hack around it when I do need the speed. I do not work only with objects in `Rings()` but can formally compose morphisms. Really, there is no way around this regression other than not having these checks up through the category first.

I am not. Also, anybody trying to understand why this change was made latter will not have this context either. Since a few people in a room are making decisions and not giving me this context, I am going to stop reviewing and writing any code involving ring morphisms/coercions. I've spent too much time, energy, and political capital working on this.
