Keywords: IPython config

After #12719, user configuration files (in `.sage/ipython-0.12/profile_default/` and `.../profile_sage/`) seem to be effectively ignored: I think they are read after the Sage terminal app has already been initialized, at which point it is too late. 

The attached patch remedies this, reading the configuration from `.sage/ipython-0.12/profile_default/ipython_config.py` during the initialization. Question: should it read from this directory or from `profile_sage`?

I changed your code to override `load_config_file()` instead of stuffing it in the ctor. Now the configuration is only loaded once, as one can easily check by putting a print statement into `ipython_config.py`. 

Also, after discussion with Jason and William we decided to default to colors in the terminal. For simplicity I just added this into this patch.

pexpect children have the environment variable `TERM` unset (#12221, similar: #12263). We did this precisely to solve problems like this where the terminal did strange things.
