I could also imagine trying to use the results from `./configure` to decide which packages to download, which to skip because they are already available from the system. But if someone wants to download once and then distribute to colleagues on a thumb drive, it's a good idea to have all of the standard packages.

Replying to [comment:7 jhpalmieri]:
> Should this be using the same logic as `make dist` to determine what to download?

That's my instinct. We probably don't need both `make download-for-sdist` and `make download` in that case.

The branch "fixes" `make download` (and also cleans up `src/bin/` a bit more, on top of #30846 and similar earlier tickets).

I don't use this myself, so I don't know what is the best way to proceed regarding "standard" vs. "all" vs. "configured" packages. Perhaps they should be 3 different make targets.

says: "If there were a command-line switch to download all standard
+ optional + experimental packages then I could test that..." (i.e.
test they all download properly, to avoid missing upstream tarballs
