CC:  @dimpase @jhpalmieri

Move to `build/bin` (no longer installed in `SAGE_LOCAL`) because they are only used by some `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-install` scripts, not by anything in src:

`testcc.sh`, `testcflags.sh`, `testcxx.sh`

(Part of #21559.)


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29381
