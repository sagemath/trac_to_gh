# Issue 29144: Move testc*.sh from src/bin to build/bin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29381

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-03-20 20:35:08

CC:  dimpase jhpalmieri

Move to `build/bin` (no longer installed in `SAGE_LOCAL`) because they are only used by some `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-install` scripts, not by anything in src:

`testcc.sh`, `testcflags.sh`, `testcxx.sh`

(Part of #21559.)

I would be tempted to delete `testcxx.sh`, since it doesn't appear to be used anywhere.

User packages might be using it
