`ElementWrapper` implements the `_richcmp_` hook, so you do not need the ``@`richcmp_method` for `CoxeterGroup.Element`. Also, I thought ``@`richcmp_method` was passed down to subclasses, so I don't think they are needed for the subclasses. Maybe I'm mistaken?

Here is a better version, thanks.

Indeed, inheriting seems to be ok.
