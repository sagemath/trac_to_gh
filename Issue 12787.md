Changing keywords from "realizations" to "realizations, sd40".

Implement default methods for (With)Realizations that use the realization provided by the method a_realization for computations:

- `AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.product` is modified to use
  product_by_coercion if `product_on_basis` is not available
- `Magmas.Realizations` added and
  `Magmas.Realizations.ParentMethods.product_by_coercion` uses
  `self.a_realization()`
- `CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations` added and
  `CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.zero`
  returns `self.a_realization().zero()`
- `Monoids.WithRealizations` added and `Monoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.one`
  returns `self.a_realization().one()`
- `Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.inject_shorthands` : injects any
  shorthands names for realizations provided in the `_shorthands` attribute
- added `_shorthand` attribute to the example in
  `sage.categories.example.with_realizations`

And update `examples/with_realizations.py` accordingly.

100% doctest coverage for algebras_with_basis

Mike pointed out that `algebras_with_basis.py` needed only 1 doctest to get 100% coverage, so this latest patch adds one.

Latest patch switches to using the class name for determining the default realization name (currently, the class name is taken and it is rendered lowercase for some reason; there was a FIXME suggesting this should not be lowercased).

For the record: I imported the latest version of the patches in the Sage-Combinat queue, and rebased my functorial construction patch on top of it.

Cheers,

There was a question mark at the end of the FIXME; so this was to be discussed! Oh well, since it's merged in, I guess we can just consider the discussion as closed.
