The commit message is nonsensical:

```
[mq]: trac_8362_doc_fix-sl.patch
```

*Note to release manager:* When merging the patch, qrefresh and replace the above message with a sensible commit message such as:

```
#8362: Fix typo in documentation of Disjoint Union of Enumerated Sets
```

I just fixed the commit message. The release manager won't need to do it.
