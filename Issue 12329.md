Some Sage packages want to run `autoconf`/`autoheader`/`automake` during installation.  This may fail, since `auto$foo` is not a prerequisite of Sage.  Usually, the build still works but in some cases, this may cause the build to fail (this happens for example with `ecm-6.3.p3` on the Skynet machine "iras").  This can usually be fixed by fixing timestamps, and only patching "configure", not "configure.in".

Packages which need to be fixed:
* cddlib
* ecm
* libm4rie
* maxima
* pynac
