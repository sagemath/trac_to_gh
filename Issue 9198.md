Non-existent username does not yield error message when sharing worksheet in notebook.  If you attempt to share a worksheet in the notebook with a username that does not exist, it would be useful to have an error message.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
