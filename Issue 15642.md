# Issue 15642: Prevent Python to use system hg and svn when it is built

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15879

Original creator: jpflori

When python gets built, the first minimal version built can try to use the system hg and svn and fail (because its minimal or because we mess with ld_library_path).
This can make the build process.
