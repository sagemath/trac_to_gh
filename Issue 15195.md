Following http://bugs.python.org/issue417795, we should probably only reference the dict weakly from the callback object to avoid unnecessary circular references.

As we found in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15367#comment:39, if an object C involved in a reference cycle becomes unreachable as a side effect of circular GC (e.g., a callback somewhere), the object C will only be collected by GC in the next round. A non-circularly referenced object C would have its reference count hit 0 and would be collected immediately. That is already a good reason to try and avoid circular references, even now that Python does clean them up eventually.

See also http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13394#comment:19 (reasoning the validity of using a strongly referencing closure should be fine in theory -- this didn't take into account the practical consideration above).

The branch here descends directly from master, which recently had 5.13beta3 merged. Therefore, as posted, this ticket has no dependencies. Since it only touches one file, that isn't even present in the branch for #15367 (its branch split off before 5.13beta3 merger), I expect no merge problems with that ticket.

I actually have a bit of trouble coming up with an example that shows a difference in behaviour for WeakValueDictionary (before this ticket it's not weakly refererrable, making examples particularly tricky). With the following code:

```
%cpaste
import gc
from sage.misc.weak_dict import WeakValueDictionary
from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
def Nobj(t):
    return len([1 for o in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(o,t)])
def TestTcollect(T,args=()):
    N=Nobj(T)
    print "Number of T-objects before we start:",N
    L=[T(*args) for i in range(100)]
    M=MonoDict(11)
    for i in range(len(L)-1):
        M[L[i]]=L[i+1]
    Nnew=Nobj(T)
    print "Number of T-objects after list construction:",Nnew
    print "Throwing away references:"
    del L
    Nnew=Nobj(T)
    if Nnew == N:
        print "no GC required to get rid of objects";
    j=0
    while Nnew>N:
        j+=1
        _=gc.collect()
        Ntemp=Nobj(T)
        if Ntemp >= Nnew:
            raise RuntimeError("we're not collecting at all!")
        Nnew=Ntemp
    print "number of collects required:",j
class dd(dict):
    "a weakly reffable and easily recognized dict class"
    pass
class selfref(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.D=self
--
```

I'm getting with a self-referencing class:

```
sage: TestTcollect(selfref)
Number of T-objects before we start: 0
Number of T-objects after list construction: 100
Throwing away references:
number of collects required: 100
```

The test doesn't work for dict itself (they have their own freelist etc. so
the object count you get back can't be trusted), but we can do it on a subclass:

```
sage: TestTcollect(dd)
Number of T-objects before we start: 0
Number of T-objects after list construction: 100
Throwing away references:
no GC required to get rid of objects
number of collects required: 0
```

For this patched `WeakValueDictionary` we're still getting problematic behaviour:

```
sage: TestTcollect(sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary)
Number of T-objects before we start: 29
Number of T-objects after list construction: 129
Throwing away references:
number of collects required: 100
```

Whereas python's own is clean:

```
sage: TestTcollect(weakref.WeakValueDictionary)
Number of T-objects before we start: 3
Number of T-objects after list construction: 103
Throwing away references:
no GC required to get rid of objects
number of collects required: 0
```

As is (at least our old) `TripleDict`:

```
sage: TestTcollect(sage.structure.coerce_dict.TripleDict,(11,))
Number of T-objects before we start: 180
Number of T-objects after list construction: 280
Throwing away references:
no GC required to get rid of objects
number of collects required: 0
```

So my guess is that we've overlooked another self reference in
WeakValueDictionary.

Note that our previous `sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary` wasn't weakly
referrable so this test doesn't apply in that case.

And of course there is another circular reference from the `_IterationContext`. Making that weak as well makes the thing collectable, so with the new branch we get that `TestTcollect` works as desired.

Note that if you have objects chained by keys in a `WeakValueDictionary`, immediate collectibility of the chain could depend on the WeakValueDictionary not keeping circular references to itself.

So, I think this patch could have real effect of memory footprint in sage code.

```

Incidentally, I think we can do away with the `_IterationContext` by using a `try/finally`:

```
cython("""
def gen():
    try:
        while True:
            yield 1
    finally:
        print "finally clause executed"
""")
sage: G=gen()
sage: G.next()
1
sage: del G
finally clause executed
sage: G=gen()
sage: del G  #code is never entered, so `try/finally` clause is also not encountered
```

So instead of using a `with` context manager, I think we can get away with writing our iterators as

```
        cdef PyObject *key, *wr
        cdef Py_ssize_t pos = 0
        try:
            self._enter_iter()
            while PyDict_Next(self, &pos, &key, &wr):
                #this check doesn't really say anything: by the time
                #the key makes it to the customer, it may have already turned
                #invalid. It's a cheap check, though.
                if PyWeakref_GetObject(wr)!=Py_None:
                    yield <object>key
        finally:
            self._exit_iter()
```

where `_enter_iter` and `_exit_iter` can be the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods on `_IterationContext`, adapted to be methods of `WeakValueDictionary` immediately. That saves us a weakref and an extra class (see pushed commit).

```

Anyway, the `sage --dev pull` was automatically merging your branch into my local version of the "develop" branch, and I think this is what I wanted to end up with. Now I can continue with the review.

Hooray! After pulling the correct commit, I get

```
sage: TestTcollect(weakref.WeakValueDictionary)
Number of T-objects before we start: 3
Number of T-objects after list construction: 103
Throwing away references:
no GC required to get rid of objects
number of collects required: 0
```

and the answer came a lot faster than before. All tests pass, and the patch (i.e., the diff between the develop branch and this branch after merging with the develop branch) looks reasonable to me. 

Hence, I can *almost* give it a positive review. How can I do a review patch? Is it possible to make some changes and then do `sage --dev push`, or what is to do for the equivalent of a review patch?

Yes to both.
* If you made an unnecessary merge, revert it first (`git reset --hard HEAD~`) 
* for your review patch you just add another commit and then replace the branch (either manually with git or with `sage -dev push`)
