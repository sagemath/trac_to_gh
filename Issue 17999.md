When trying to feed Sage a new `pynac...tar.xz` I get:

```
Setting up build directory for pynac-0.3.5
tar: Archive is compressed. Use -J option
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Error: failed to extract /home/ralf/sage/upstream/pynac-0.3.5.tar.xz
```

The difference in compression is significant:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf users 512029 Apr 17 09:14 pynac-0.3.5.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf users 652879 Apr 17 09:14 pynac-0.3.5.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf users 443976 Apr 17 09:15 pynac-0.3.5.tar.xz
```

`-J`  is the right option for `.xz` I am not sure what is happening internally but `-a` smartly identify the compression and applies the right filter if available.
