I just have two remarks but not for this ticket I guess:

- Don't we want to use faster functions in `py_scalar_to_element`?

- It is clear that we want compatibility between `structure.coerce.py_scalar_parent` and `structure.element.py_scalar_to_element`. I do not like the fact that these two functions belong to two different files and do not call each other in their doctests.

If you mean functions like `PyFoo_Check()`: Cython knows them too, it will generate calls to `PyFoo_Check()` in `isinstance`.

> - It is clear that we want compatibility between `structure.coerce.py_scalar_parent` and `structure.element.py_scalar_to_element`. I do not like the fact that these two functions belong to two different files and do not call each other in their doctests.

Nope. I meant the conversion `Python int` -> `Sage integer` and such. The `import` takes quite a long time and `ZZ(x)` is suboptimal to create an integer.

I did not know

```
sage: isinstance(True,int)
True
```

Do we really want the `bool -> Integer` to happen within Sage? We can do an exact type check instead. That would break support for subtyped Python base classes though. Another drawback is that it would not be possible anymore to count like

```
sage: sum((x >= 3 for x in my_list), ZZ(0))
```

So I am in favor of your solution.

For the speed-up, that is not dramatic.

I changed the doc to make the link `:class:`Element`` works. I am ok for positive review.
