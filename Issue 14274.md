The (Ring-)LWE problem is a central problem in cryptography these days, but generators for LWE instances are not easily available. At 

    https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-generator/

a family of LWE generators is implemented.

We should include this in Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14478
