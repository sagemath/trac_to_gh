# Issue 14274: (Ring-) Learning with Errors Oracles

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14478

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2013-04-23 11:30:43

Assignee: mvngu

The (Ring-)LWE problem is a central problem in cryptography these days, but generators for LWE instances are not easily available. At 

    https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-generator/

a family of LWE generators is implemented.

We should include this in Sage.

Note to reviewer: we cross-refereed the correctness of parameter choices, so the main task would probably be to check that the patch is up to Sage's formal standards.

The indentation should be fixed now.

I rebuilt the docs with the three patches applied and saw no warning.
