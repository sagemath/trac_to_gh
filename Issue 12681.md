```
E = EllipticCurve([-879984,319138704])
P1 = E.point((540,1188))
P2 = E.point((576,1836))
P3 = E.point((468,3132))
P4 = E.point((612,3132))
P5 = E.point((432,4428))
t = cputime()
pts = E.integral_points([P1,P2,P3,P4,P5])
print "Time:", cputime(t)
```


With sage-4.8, this takes about 35 seconds.  With sage-5.0.beta10, the
same test takes about 50 seconds.

According to Volker Braun, this is caused by #11599.

As a reviewer of #11599: it was a major clean up of the generic scheme code which made it readable and conforming to current Sage framework, please don't unmerge it...

I can confirm that this is caused by #11599.  When applying #11599 to sage-5.0.beta3, I get the same slowdown.

Well, if the slow-down cannot be fixed, I have not much choice...  I don't want to release sage-5.0 with such a massive speed regression.

With this patch on Sage-5.0.beta12 the example from the description drops on my machine from 37 to 12 seconds, which seems to be a severe speed-up compared to pre-#11599 state.

Given that this is achieved by a one-liner taking repeated computations out of the loop, perhaps nobody was really bothered by the speed of this code and as long as it works it is fine...

For the record: profiler shows drop from 24 to 9 millions of primitive calls.

Positive review provided:
 1. You put a proper commit message in your patch
 2. This actually passes doctests (which I'm checking right now)
