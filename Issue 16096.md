Here is a link to the lrs page (which has relevant papers there): http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/USERGUIDE.html

This is what I would think as best way to go (as stated in Gambit FAQ: lrs is more robust) but that paper (pointed out by kcrisman) which points at Gambit will be super useful to evaluate the best way to go.

Where is this FAQ?  I couldn't find it easily.

Thinking out loud below:

* lrs seems to just be about polytopes - useful, to be sure, but I'm just wondering whether reinventing the entire rest of the Gambit wheel is a great idea.  For instance, Gambit's McKelvey was THE McKelvey.  How much of lrs do we really need for finding equilibria, as opposed to all the other many things one does in game theory?
* However, Gambit doesn't talk about cooperative or matching game theory (tickets #16332, #16331)
* Maybe it would be worth talking to the Gambit folks [directly](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom+to+University+of+East+Anglia,+Norwich,+United+Kingdom&saddr=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom&daddr=University+of+East+Anglia,+Norwich,+United+Kingdom&hl=en&sll=42.515595,-70.847233&sspn=0.092114,0.149517&geocode=FaOfEQMdkH7P_yHKInGeCcdt4CmvKwE2vRxuSDHKInGeCcdt4A%3BFWLyIgMdiOgSACFz5UQH8Hu5uSkBWIB72ODZRzFz5UQH8Hu5uQ&oq=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom+to+university+of+east+a&t=h&z=8) about how/whether any common work would be useful?

I like the idea of having wrapper classes that could make use of Sage's ability to show things in an aesthetically pleasing way, anything involving latex would be great for example.

I agree, gambit actually uses its own .efg and .nfg file formats for representing games with the aim of them being easily readable by humans. Given that there isn't much else out there they may become a standard themselves.

Yes!  Just like

```
sage: graphs.[tab]
graphs.Balaban10Cage
graphs.Balaban11Cage
graphs.BalancedTree
graphs.BarbellGraph
graphs.BidiakisCube
graphs.BiggsSmithGraph
graphs.BishopGraph
graphs.BrinkmannGraph
<snip>
sage: matroids.[tab]
matroids.AG               matroids.Uniform          matroids.named_matroids
matroids.CompleteGraphic  matroids.Wheel            
matroids.PG               matroids.Whirl            
```
This would be awesome, a built-in library one could explore of basic examples.

Hi!

James has just pushed a pretty substantial piece of work. This creates a `NormalFormGame` class that brings with it 3 algorithms to compute equilibria:

1. LCP (a gambit algorithm)
2. lrs
3. A bespoke support enumeration algorithm (this is the slowest of algorithms but allows users to find equilibria if the above two packages aren't installed).

There is also a lot of documentation that has been written (and it builds! :)). Finally, if it's of interest we're actively continuously testing this by generating random games and trying all 3 algorithms. You can find a bunch of plots (and the raw data) here: https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory.

Hello Vince ! It would be really cool if you made your branch a bit more 'reviewer-friendly'. Right now it seems to follow the development history, but you want this to be re-read by somebody and it would be nice to not have a commit that fixes a bug introduced in a previous commit.

With git, you can very easily merge commits together, as part of the rebase command. Try something like that:

- Checkout your branch, and type 'git checkout -b rebased_version'. This, to make sure that we do not touch your old branch so nothing can go wrong.
- 'git rebase -i develop'. This will 'replay' all your commits on top of the latest develop version. It will open a text editor, and you will see how easy it is to merge two commits, or reorder them.

At the end of this procedure, the branch `rebased_version` will be on top of the latest develop version, and its history should be cleaner. You can call 'git rebase -i develop' several times if needed.

Hope that will help.

Maybe better now is "the various algorithms"?

Finally, I think the parser is working fine but could use a little extra tlc if and when games with more than 2 players are implemented, as it is a very long series of things to parse for the reader (I mean the code like `profile.append(tuple(gambitstrategy[previousplayerstrategylength: previousplayerstrategylength + len(player.strategies)]))`) though I agree it should work correctly.

I don't see any other issues.  Thanks for breaking all of these tickets apart!  It really made it a lot easier to get figured out.

I've added a pointer to the gambit documentation. Let me know if you think I've said too much/little.

Yup: have put that in.

I agree, I'm hoping that future dev will further integrate all the gambit algorithms, as this happens the parser will be in turn expanded. The next thing I'll be working on is #17392 though :)

A few more things, largely about the gambit docs document.
* It's capitalized `IPython`, for whatever reason - the gambit docs thing is not correct that way, I missed it earlier.
* Here

```
The `python API documentation for gambit
<http://www.gambit-project.org/gambit14/pyapi.html>_` 
```
  I think the syntax needs to put the underscore after the backtick.
* There are several things in single backticks (like ``LCP``, but look for them, it's not the only one) that should be in double backticks ```LCP```.

Otherwise I think we are okay.

Yup: have fixed.

Looked for these and think there was just that one that I recognised. I did find various things in single back ticks but I think there done so correctly, I might well be confused by the syntax though: if you could point out one that is not right that should clarify what I'm misunderstanding and I'll go ahead and fix all the rest. (Apologies for not finding these, have built the docs and read through but think I'm just missing it).

Thanks again :)

A good idea!   I also (nearly) did that.

[This commit](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=70b61ab33aef1500ded86d5c750c7fe379f76b0c) actually makes it worse; it changes one `IPython` and then doesn't correctly fix an `ipython`.  Why don't you back up to before that commit and fix them correctly - all should be first two letters caps, rest lowercase.

I think you got 'em.

Not at all: I appreciate the opportunity to try and learn :) Haven't quite gotten it (this push is a single commit for example that seems to have grabbed more...) but I will!
