Add a function to recognize if a lattice can be constructed by Day doubling constructions of any (possible) subsets.

Before this wait #22693 to get reviewed and closed.

Martin? This is quite direct implementation.

Long note in the decription is not needed for review.

I got an answer from Tristan Holmes. There are lattices that have congruence lattice having both maximal chains satisfying and not satisfying the needed property. Hence the code can not be easily optimized.

(There is room for optimization -- not all congruences are always needed to compute -- but that's a different story.)

Travis, can you look at this?

(I think that after this, maybe in July, I want to make a code for doing the decomposition. Not sure if it should be a `certificate` for this or another function. Anyways, congruence-related functions are almost done now.)

One little this:

```diff
-                if e_up not in reachable:
-                    if splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
+                if e_up not in reachable and splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
```

Otherwise LGTM.

`If ...: ... if` changed to `if ... and ...:`.
