Add a function to recognize if a lattice can be constructed by Day doubling constructions of any (possible) subsets.

Before this wait #22693 to get reviewed and closed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22745

Martin? This is quite direct implementation.

I got an answer from Tristan Holmes. There are lattices that have congruence lattice having both maximal chains satisfying and not satisfying the needed property. Hence the code can not be easily optimized.

(There is room for optimization -- not all congruences are always needed to compute -- but that's a different story.)

Travis, can you look at this?

One little this:

```diff
-                if e_up not in reachable:
-                    if splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
+                if e_up not in reachable and splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
```

Otherwise LGTM.
