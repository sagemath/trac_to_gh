I just gave it a try but gave up not very long after
1) Sage patches matplotlib for some libpng detection issue, and this patch does not apply
2) As it only seemed useful on Mac OS X I tried without that patch
3) There is an error during the installation because of some "https" protocol that isn't supported

That's when I lost hope `^^;`

Ooops sorry, I had not noticed you had updated it.

Well, I gave it another try with those files and this part worked fine, but I still get the error I saw when I first tried it by myself :
http://www.steinertriples.fr/m.log

By the way, for some reason the .log file that Sage claims should be located at /home/ncohen/.Sage/logs/pkgs/matplotlib-1.3.1.log does not exist.. But well `O_o`

I don't know why the error is occurring, but it looks like it is happening because of downloading the `distribute` package. 

On one hand, I think if you updated `setuptools` (that is, ticket #15510), it would avoid this error. On the other hand, updating `setuptools` will cause problems with building and (if you get past that) doctesting the notebook.

Maybe you can try downloading and installing `distribute` manually:

```
curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.28.tar.gz
tar xfz distribute-0.6.28.tar.gz
cd distribute-0.6.28
sage -sh
python setup.py install
exit
```
