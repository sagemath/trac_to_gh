Keywords: padic printing, sd87

Currently, in the printing mode `digits`, the "initial" zeroes of a p-adic number are not displayed:

```
sage: R = Zp(5, print_mode='digits')
sage: R(89)
...324
```

It is a bit annoying because the precision does not appear on the printing. Even worse, when "initial" zeroes are located after the decimal mark, there appears as question mark whereas they are not unknown:

```
sage: x = R(89)/5^5; x
...?.??324
sage: x.precision_absolute()
15
```

I would suggest to change this behaviour and display all digits (including the initial zeroes) until the precision. Any thoughts?

I'm happy to add zeros indicating the precision.

There's also a question of whether digits are should be printed in an opposite order, to align with the convention for real numbers where "smaller" digits appear further to the right.  I'm comfortable with the current ordering, but others have suggested a change over the years.

I'm happy with the general principle.  A couple suggestions:

* Why are there trailing zeros in the hunk `-874,8 +874,24 `@``@` cdef class pAdicPrinter_class(SageObject)`?
* If they are supposed to be there, you should use `alphabet[0]` rather than `"0"`.
* Can you add some doctests showing the improved behavior?
