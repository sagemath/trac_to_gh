Keywords: Demazure product, subword complex

The provided patch implements the Demazure product of a word in the generators of a Coxeter group.

The definition can be found e.g. in "Knutson, Miller - Subword complexes for Coxeter groups".


```

            sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',2])

            sage: w = W.demazure_product([2,2,1])
            sage: w.reduced_word()
            [2, 1]

            sage: w = W.demazure_product([2,1,2,1,2])
            sage: w.reduced_word()
            [1, 2, 1]

            sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B',2])

            sage: w = W.demazure_product([2,1,2,1,2])
            sage: w.reduced_word()
            [2, 1, 2, 1]
```


As I also needed it, the patch provides in addition a method returning the cartan type of a Coxeter group.
