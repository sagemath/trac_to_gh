It turns out that the FFT stuff we wrap from GSL is not in the reference manual.  That's a problem, as people can't find it easily.

well, it seems to be in the doc, see

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/calculus/sage/gsl/fft.html?highlight=fft

This is quickly found by searching for FFT

So maybe this ticket can be closed ?
