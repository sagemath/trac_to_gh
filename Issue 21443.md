The version of the package thebe is just the git commit hash. Also SPKG.txt recommends to use the hash for future releases. Please use increasing version numbers like date or date+commit, so that versions can be compared.

There has only ever been one version and it's going to stay that way. Thebe is a dead project and it will be removed from Sage in #24593.
