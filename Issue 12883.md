Keywords: numerical_approx

By going via SR we can lose precision when using numerical_approx:

```

sage: p
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749
sage: parent(p)
Real Field with 200 bits of precision
sage: SR(p)
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749
sage: SR(p).n()
3.14159265358979
sage: parent(SR(p).n())
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

The information is still there, though (as is obvious from the fact the string produced has all those extra digits):

```
sage: SR(p).pyobject()
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749
sage: parent(SR(p).pyobject())
Real Field with 200 bits of precision
```

This might not seem that significant -- we could interpret "n" as always defaulting to 53 bits unless specified otherwise -- but it can cause some headaches when trying to get hold=True to behave nicely. I'd prefer that f(1.2345678901234567890) give the same answer as f(1.2345678901234567890, hold=True).n(), especially now that we typically get the precision from the parent.

> About `hold=True`, that even doesn't seem to work with real numbers:

Exactly, which is why I didn't use that example.

Okay, I don't have that much invested in this.   But then 

```
sage: x = 1.2340000000000000000000001
sage: x.n?
Docstring:
   Return a numerical approximation of x with at least prec bits of
   precision.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: (2/3).n()
      0.666666666666667
      sage: pi.n(digits=10)
      3.141592654
      sage: pi.n(prec=20)   # 20 bits
      3.1416

   TESTS:

   Check that http://trac.sagemath.org/14778 is fixed:

      sage: (0).n(algorithm='foo')
      0.000000000000000
```
should really be improved, and possibly the documentation for other versions of `.numerical_approx` as well.  Those are practically stubs!

This is actually a general problem we have with Sage documentation: often one has similar functions/methods which all do the same thing (on different kinds of objects). In this case, the `numerical_approx` function in `src/sage/misc/functional.py` is much better documented. What's the optimal solution which doesn't simply replicate the documentation from `numerical_approx()`?

Most of the changes look good to me, but I don't like the new description of `RealLiteral.numerical_approx()`: as far as I understand “real literals” are exact decimal numbers, so converting one to a `RealField` element with d·log₁₀ 2 bits of precision doesn't really “change its precision” to d decimal digits.

And—just wondering, I have nothing against that choice—is there a reason why you didn't put the generic implementation directly in `Element` (and put code to convert non-Elements to Elements before calling it when necessary)?

Because of the "put code to convert non-Elements to Elements before calling it" part. I don't know how to do that in general.
