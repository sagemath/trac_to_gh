# Issue 16132: Improve coercion to interfaces in SageObject

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The coercion methods `_interface_`, `_gp_`, ... are almost completely undocumented. Also there are a few oddities there which this ticket resolves.

The (multiline) comments of the individual commits provide further detail on why I changed things.

Did you forget to attach a branch to the ticket?

No. I ran into some trouble with pickling while working on this. I'll attach a branch when I get to work on this again (probably during bug days).

I changed my mind about this. The pickling issues make this not worth it.
