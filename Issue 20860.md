# Issue 20860: incorrect parent for dynatomic polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21097

dynatomic_polynomial returns polynomial over integers (instead of rationals) when called on rational function over QQ for fixed point polynomial


```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^3-y^3*2, y^3])
dyna = f.dynatomic_polynomial([0,1])
dyna.parent()
```

The 0th dynatomic polynomial should be returning as 0, not the same as dynatomic_polynomial(1)


```
P.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
H = End(P)
f = H([x^2+5*y^2, y^2])
print f.dynatomic_polynomial([0, 0])
print f.dynatomic_polynomial(0)
```

added missing case and a slight optimization of code

In the cases of dynatomic_polynomial([0,0]) and dynatomic_polynomial(0), it returns the number 0.  Should always return a polynomial, so should be the zero polynomial.

In documentation: We have

```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
S = R.quo(R.ideal(y^2-x+1))
P.<u,v> = ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(S),1)
H = End(P)
f = H([u^2 + S(x^2)*v^2, v^2])
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,1])
```


In this case, 

```
f.dynatomic_polynomial([1,1]).parent()
```

also returns Symbolic Ring.

Might be good to move all of the "Symbolic Ring" examples to the end. A  little confusing as currently formatted.
