# Issue 6925: Fast way of calculating cuspidal subgroup of J0(N)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: syazdani

Original creation time: 2009-09-11 23:49:01

Assignee: tbd

CC:  pbruin

Keywords: cuspidal subgroup, modular abelian variety

This is the first implementation of Ligozat's method of calculating the rational cuspidal subgroup of J_0(N). This is done by doing linear algebra in d(N)*d(N) matrices, which seems considerably faster than the modular symbol methods.

This code is functional at this point. The problems with it are
a) __cmp__ is not called.
b) Hecke operators aren't defined yet.
c) can't coerce specific degree zero cuspidal divisors in our group.

Has this been checked on Solaris? Or OS X? It's not clear what it has been tested on. 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

Hi Soroosh,

1. Can you look into the following doctest failures (against sage-4.4.1, say, where your code applies fine)?

```

```


2. Everwhere that you have

```
Examples::  
    sage:
```

change it to


```
EXAMPLES::  

    sage:
```

(note the newline)

3. Everywhere you have -'d lists, e.g.,

```
        691	        - `` parent`` - a subgroup of the cuspidal subgroup of  
 	692	        J0(N) 
 	693	 
 	694	        - ``element`` - an element in the quotient module of degree zero divisors of cusps 
 	695	        modulo principal divisors. 
 	696	 
 	697	        - ``check`` - bool (default: False) whether to check 
 	698	        that element is in the appropriate module 
```

change them so the second line (etc.) starts exactly two spaces in from the dash so it lines up with the previous line's text, e.g., 

```
        691	        - `` parent`` - a subgroup of the cuspidal subgroup of  
 	692	          J0(N) 
 	693	 
 	694	        - ``element`` - an element in the quotient module of degree zero divisors of cusps 
 	695	          modulo principal divisors. 
 }}}

4. Can you be more careful that the docstrings match what they are documenting, e.g., 
{{{
764	    def _sub_(self, other): 
 	765	        r""" 
 	766	        Adds two elements in the cuspidal subgroup. 
}}}
It should be "Subtract" not add. 

5. 
{{{
        827	    def __cmp__(self, other): 
 	828	        r""" 
 	829	        Checks if two elements are the same. Right now this is not called, and I'm not sure why. 
}}}

You probably need to use/call __richmp__ instead...  there is some funny rule that if you define __cmp__ you have to also define __hash__ or something. Search sage-devel about this. 

7. Change this
{{{
        495	        TESTS: 
 	496	            sage: J=J0(25) 
}}}
to
{{{
        495	        TESTS::
        496
 	497	            sage: J=J0(25) 
}}}

8. I'm not sure about the name "RationalDirectCuspidalSubgroup".  Maybe "RationalCuspidalSubgroupLigozat" or something, i.e., use "Ligozat" instead of direct?

here is a first cleanup patch.

There is one failing doctest that needs a mathematical check.

Could please someone with the required math knowledge check the unique failing doctest (see patchbot report by clicking on the round icon at the top of the page) ?

I have replaced the failing test, without checking the mathematical side..

I have also added a reference to Ligozat, hopefully the correct one ?

This should now pass all tests.

Comment by syazdani created at 2013-10-07 05:50:09

changed the name to rational_cuspidal_subgroup_ligozat, and few other changes.


---

Attachment

Chapoton's fix was correct. The initial doctest was incorrect.

Also, that is the correct Ligozat reference. I added the reference to my paper as well, which is what the algorithm is based upon.

I changed the name of rational_direct_cuspidal_subgroup to rational_cuspidal_subgroup_ligozat, as it was suggested, and replaced cmp function with eq and ne functions instead.

Finally, sorry for being MIA on this ticket for so long. I think I had an incorrect filter archiving these emails automatically.

Comment by syazdani created at 2013-10-13 15:29:19

hmm... are the patches supposed to be made from a clean build, or from the previous build? I applied your patches, and then used hg_sage.export. So, three patches need to be applied in order. That might not be the correct approach though.

Hello,

it seems that your patch was twice the same thing. Anyway, I have folded it into a new version of trac_6925_addon1.patch

apply 6925-rationalcuspidal.patch trac_6925_addon1.patch

Replying to [comment:29 rws]:
> patchbot failed
The failed plugin is `non_ascii`, because of the French accents in the author and journal of Ligozat's article.  We can ignore this, since the file has a `coding: utf-8` declaration in its first line.

What do you mean by `needs work` ? Unicode characters are ok as soon as the utf8 encoding is specified at top of the file, which is the case here. Is there anything that really needs to be corrected ???

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2017-07-13 18:06:59

Do `RationalCuspidalSubgroupLigozat` and `RationalCuspSubgroup` provide the same features? Apparently it does

```
sage: X.rational_cuspidal_subgroup_ligozat()
Finite subgroup with invariants (2, 4) over QQ of Abelian variety J0(15) of dimension 1
sage: X.rational_cuspidal_subgroup()
Finite subgroup with invariants [2, 4] over QQ of Abelian variety J0(15) of dimension 1
```

It would be much better to provide an optional argument to `rational_cuspidal_subgroup` rather than having a distinct method. This branch provides (important) implementation details but nothing mathematically relevant. Moreover, inheritance choices should be more clearly explained.

The function names `_compute_XXX` make no sense. Should just be `_XXX`.

They don't provide the same features so I think they should stay separate. For instance,

```
sage: J = J0(15)
sage: G = J.rational_cuspidal_subgroup()
sage: H = J.rational_cuspidal_subgroup_ligozat()
sage: G.intersection(J)

That was not my question. Do they represent the same mathematical object? The fact that some methods are not implemented is a minor difference.
