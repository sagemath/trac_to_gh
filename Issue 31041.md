This is actually an upstream issue in `ipywidgets` marked in the source code as a "TODO":
https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/setup.py#L115

This dependency pulls in a full installation of the Jupyter notebook. 

```
notebook>=4.4.1->widgetsnbextension~=3.5.0->ipywidgets==7.5.1
```

This is an obstacle to avoiding to build a copy of the jupyter notebook (connecting to a system jupyter notebook).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31278
