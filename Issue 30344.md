Is the following addition really necessary?

```
+# PEP 517 builds do not have . in sys.path
+sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))
```

Not having `.` in the path is needed for the build isolation. (I'm fine with adding it for the moment and removing it in a follow-up ticket.)

Otherwise looks good to me!
