Need to spend a little time digesting exactly what's going on with the base 2 logarithms and the algorithm.

Right now, `AlternatingSignMatrices(n).random_element()` returns an element of `AlternatingSignMatrices(n-1)` (since an `n x n` ASM has a `n+1 x n+1` height function. Changing the line `order = self._n` to `order = self._n +1` should fix that.

Jessica has an alternate implementation using the `random_element()` method on `GelfandTsetlinPatterns` (which also uses coupling from the past). Once I get the code for that, I'll do some timing comparisons.

The implementation using monotone triangle/Gelfand Tsetlin patterns was consistently faster for various sizes than the method using height functions (and doesn't require reinventing the wheel).

I'm actually not 100% that I have the formatting for documentation right, so I'll need to double-check that.
