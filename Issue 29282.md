# Issue 29282: Provide more informative message when tides not installed

Running Sage commands relying on the 'tides' optional package
results in an error message that confuses new users. See e.g.

It would be nice to display a more informative error message.

Maybe we could make tides a standard package?

It has been optional already for a while, without relevant problems.

Soon most standard packages will be kind of optional too (#29705), so regardless of whether we make this package standard, the error handling should be improved (using `FeatureNotPresentError`).

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
