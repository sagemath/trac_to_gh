The last term is 3/2, but the correct value is 2 (because sqrt(x+2) is 2 for x = 2).

This answer is correct. Note that the linear term is not written as a multiple of x-2.

Oh, you're right, I overlooked it. It's little confusing to provide the result in such a “mixed” form.

Reopen, as the output should be fixed, maybe using `hold`.
