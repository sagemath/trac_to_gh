This is a change I had in my Python 3 branch that at some point I think I found helpful for debugging something; I can't even remember what.  But it still seemed like a worthwhile change.

If you're changing that message anyway, can you change it to `unable to convert rational {} to an integer` to be more consistent with other error messages of the same kind?

Also in Cython files you an use f-strings:

```
raise TypeError(f"unable to convert rational {self} to an integer")
```
