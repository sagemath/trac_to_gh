If you want to use the new IPython QT console you need PyQt (and its dependency sip). This ticket adds the relevant spkgs. Together with zeromq/pyzmq (#12843), I can now run the IPython qtconsole. You need to have qt development libraries already installed in your base system, this only makes Qt available from Sage.

There is a sip package at #13047 that actually builds. W00t.  But then the PyQT package at http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/PyQt_x11-4.9.1.p0.spkg still fails *instantly*:
