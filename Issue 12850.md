# Issue 12850: Make PyQt an optional spkg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13022

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2012-05-26 15:49:49

Keywords: sd40.5

If you want to use the new IPython QT console you need PyQt (and its dependency sip). This ticket adds the relevant spkgs. Together with zeromq/pyzmq (#12843), I can now run the IPython qtconsole. You need to have qt development libraries already installed in your base system, this only makes Qt available from Sage.

Perhaps spkg-install could point out that this doesn't work on OS X:

Perhaps we can make a pySide package as well or instead?  I believe pyside doesn't use sip, and is developed directly by nokia.

Followups for problems building on OSX at #13047

There is a sip package at #13047 that actually builds. W00t.  But then the PyQT package at http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/PyQt_x11-4.9.1.p0.spkg still fails *instantly*:


```

Cannot find qmake (the Qt make tool)

If you have a private installation somewhere, put a symlink to
qmake into /Users/wstein/sage/build/sage-5.0/local/bin and rerun the PyQt installation.

... because I didn't have Qt itself (an 800MB download!) installed.  Now, with Qt installed... it still fails since I don't know how to tell PyQt where Qt is.  But I'll work on that.

OK, I strongly object to this getting a positive review without the spkg-install starting with a test if you are using OS X, and if so, gives a huge warning about there being no chance it is going to work (and that it has never, ever been tested on OS X).

The PyQt spkg installs fine for me on OSX 10.6.8 with the sip package from #13047

Thats a positive review, then?


---

Comment by jlopez created at 2012-06-17 16:12:40

From my side, it is a positive review, but perhaps somebody should test in OSX 10.7 where William found some trouble.
Also, is there an easy way of adding test suites to both packages?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-06-18 14:53:37

To the best of my knowledge they don't come with a testsuite.

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
