If `read_nonblocking()` detects an EOF condition, it should call `isalive()` to reap the child process.

Don't we also have an issue with `sage-cleaner`?

From my experience on #18267 apparently now it does, as I'm getting tracebacks ending with:

```


Unfortunately, sometimes `sage-cleaner` reaps the zombie process during `isalive()` resulting in this exception, which we don't handle in some cases, but that's a separate issue IIUC.
