# Issue 29059: Be more lenient in GLPK doctests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29296

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2020-03-08 01:08:25

We have a few doctests that check the literal output of the GLPK solution routine. Now that a system install of GLPK can be used, we have to be a little less strict about that output. For example, when GLPK is not using GMP, some numerical noise sneaks in. Here are my failures in that case:


```
