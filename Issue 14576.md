# Issue 14576: allow embedding python tuples in SR

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: burcin

Original creation time: 2013-06-19 22:28:40

Assignee: burcin

CC:  eviatarbach

Attached patch allows embedding Python tuples in symbolic expressions:


```
sage: t = SR._force_tuple((1, 2, x, x+1, x+2))
sage: t
(1, 2, x, x + 1, x + 2)
sage: t.subs(x = 2*x^2)
(1, 2, 2*x^2, 2*x^2 + 1, 2*x^2 + 2)
sage: t.op[0]
1
sage: t.op[2]
x
```

Changing keywords from "" to "sd48".

We were discussing an optional `recursive=[True|False]` keyword argument at SD48. Are you still going to implement this? Similar for the unpacking at #14802.

I replaced the attached patch. New version supports `recursive=[True|False]`.

Hmm... this works for me with `sage-5.13.beta2` on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 32-bit with a AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+ x2. Also it works for the patchbot(s) running x86_64 architectures. This might also work now since I think we've upgraded cython between now and the last time this was tested... So I'm going to set this back to positive review.

I suspect that this is a case of http://gcc.gnu.org/faq.html#dso

You can't (without wonky workarounds) use RTTI across shared libraries. We instantiate GiNaC templates in Sage, and `std::dynamic_cast` does not consider those the same as instantiations in the pynac shared library. Toughts?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-12-23 18:12:43

Possibly, but why does it only seem to fail on that specific machine? I would think if that really were the case, then it should fail across different machines, or at least different versions of Ubuntu...


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2013-12-23 18:43:06

Some compiler/linker combination may leave unused instantiations around, or instantiate too much. Its possible to only be triggered on some machines...


---

Comment by rws created at 2014-02-21 17:57:53

All tests pass on 6.2.base2 on an AMD Phenom II X6 1055T with OpenSuSE. Does the problem on the one machine still persist?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-21 22:42:23

Afaik nothing changed, so it'll still fail on Sparc. If you want to help we can get you an account. Or start a post on sage-devel to remove Sparc from the list of first-class supported platforms. IMHO it would be way more useful to spend time on ARM and POWER7 than on a long-dead platform that is plagued by linker bugs.

FYI I have no bad_cast issue on a sparc/Solaris machine (UST2+) using FSF GCC 4.7.3 and the Sun linker.

```

But as I'm looking at this ticket, I see `redhawk` is mentioned as the problematic machine and this isn't a sparc machine...

```
jpflori`@`redhawk:~$ uname -a
Linux redhawk 2.6.32-44-server #98-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 24 17:41:33 UTC 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

So was the problem occuring on another machine? (mark?)


---

Comment by rws created at 2014-03-06 15:31:29

So, rereading this, it was *not on a Sparc machine but a specific Ubuntu one. Can someone test this on a new Ubuntu installation? If it works then even if another specific Ubuntu version fails there should not be anything holding up this ticket any longer.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-03-06 15:52:37

From comment:8, the Ubuntu version is the LTS one from 4 years ago.
There's been one two years ago and will be a new one next month, so I would be in favor of ignoring the redhawk problem (and maybe update the system there to 12.04, or even 14.04 when its out).


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-03-07 14:53:10

Just for what it's worth, could you try adding

```
import ctypes   
flags = sys.getdlopenflags()
sys.setdlopenflags(flags | ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)
```

to `src/sage/all.py` and retest on `redhawk`?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-11 15:40:27

Setting `RTLD_GLOBAL` fixes the `std::bad_cast` on redhawk, interestingly. But it also leads to segfaults elsewhere...

Replying to [comment:23 vbraun]:
> Setting `RTLD_GLOBAL` fixes the `std::bad_cast` on redhawk, interestingly. But it also leads to segfaults elsewhere...
Yeah, I guess it could have been expected and that it is not a completely random choice that Python does not set it by default as it might expect to load a bunch of libraries and get symbols conflicts.
Though the fact that it is set by default on Darwin does not really point in that direction...

What about linking sage/symbolic/ring.pyx/so with libpynac.so? that is modify module_list.py to achieve that.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-11 22:59:53

Building with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC` seems to work... do we have a simple way to shitlist certain compilers by now?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-03-11 23:07:43

I think so, look into the magic which decides when to automatically install GCC in !`build/install`.

Some combinations are already "forbidden".


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-12 07:30:55

Rebuild from scratch on redhawk and now all tests pass even without `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC` (??)

Did you try the linking trick?
It seems I have access to redhawk, I'll give it a shot anyway.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-03-14 14:56:39

Doesn't change anything.
And trying to link libcsage.so with pynac makes sage crash at startup.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-15 03:11:32

It does already link against libpynac due to the magic

```
# distutils: libraries = pynac gmp
```

in `ginac.pxd`


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-03-15 17:37:51

I'm playing around with marking the pynac templates external in the Sage library (C++11 feature, but unofficial in gcc for a while now). This is one way to avoid the clash. The problems seems that, on redhawk, `GiNaC::exprseq` a.k.a. `GiNaC::container<std::vector>` is not completely instantiated inside `libpynac.so`:

```
vbraun`@`redhawk:~/test/pynac/sage$ readelf -sW local/lib/libpynac.so  | grep _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC.Ev
  2014: 0000000000169620   162 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  3594: 0000000000169620   162 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   12 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
```

vs. on my laptop:

```
$ readelf -sW local/lib/libpynac.so  | grep _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC.Ev
   468: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  7994: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC1Ev
  4012: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC2Ev
  5629: 000000000017c46e   147 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   11 _ZN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEC1Ev
```

If you know gcc name mangling by heart (and I don't blame you if you don't) then the `C1` is the full constructor while `C2` is only the base object constructor. If you use `c++filt` then that distinction is not shown (!).  

So after marking that template external in `ginac_wrap.h`, Sage still works on my lapop but fails on redhawk since the full constructor is never instantiated. I think we should just push explicit instantiation of all necessary templates into pynac, this will probably fix the bug here.

Implemented in https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/pynac/commits/af5e2c913c4399459a955b7604547941a36df88e

This does fix the issue on redhawk...

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-03-31 12:17:46

I had a look at the changes in Sage and in Pynac and both look fine (though I cannot completely ensure that some dark magic use of C++ features could still break the templating stuff).

It also compiles fine and passes long tests on a ppc system.

The only change in my branch is a typo correction.
