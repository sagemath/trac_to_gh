Well, I see it, but I suppose I am not blessed with direct commit rights to merge it.
Let me that the issue is discussed here:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-cloud/_Miielrv8Yw/XjWexn8d7nsJ
and this fix is also needed for Sage nb display (and for terminal...)

What does the following fixes

```
+            vars=sage.symbolic.ring.var(str(self.variables())[1:-1])
+            if isinstance(vars,tuple):
+                return sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(self.unparsed_input_form(), locals={str(x):x for x in vars})
+            else:
+                return sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(self.unparsed_input_form(), locals={str(vars):vars})
```

There should be at least one doctest for that.
