#18815 introduced `Polyhedron.to_linear_program` -- but there's very little one can do with it.
To 
- set an objective other than the default 0; 
- access an optimal solution vector after solving, 
one needs the MIP variable (`x` in the code of `to_linear_program`). Currently the only way to do anything is by using the MIP backend.

I would propose to return `x` as a second return value, but this of course changes the interface.

well, you may have a parameter governing what you return, and defaulting to not returning `x`, then the interface
is not changed, it is extended (i.e. no need to deprecate anything etc etc).

```
   def to_linear_program(self, solver=None, return_variable=False):
       ...
```
