People could want to do some partial tests on some really big example of a lattice or wanted to run a month-long-type computation on a big lattice (of which, there are a number of examples of finite exceptional cases that I come across in my research where the easiest way to prove things can be to do long computations).

I have no inherent objects to this, but does the static sparse digraph code have the capacity to do the meet and joins?

However, meet and join doesn't quite make sense to have it there mathematically AFAIK. Although by cythonizing `hasse_diagram.py`, we should get most of possible speed without doing really much in the way of changes.

I don't think we are in an open-ended discussion because I am proposing a (single) concrete/explicit alternative implementation.

Of course. I can review it then, and hopefully you can check docstrings I wrote.

Btw, I plan to add `lattice_of_sublattices()`. Hence the function in `hasse_diagram.py` should return something like sets, tuples etc.
