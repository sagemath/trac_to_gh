I don't know if it is the proper place to report this bug but let's try as it is relatde to morphisms of finite dimensional modules (and coercion system). The following has been obtained on the t/11111 branch.


```
sage: A5 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 5)
sage: Z5 = A5.center()
sage: phi = Z5.module_morphism(on_basis=lambda i: Z5.an_element()*Z5.basis()[i], codomain=Z5)
sage: a = list(Z5.basis())[3]
sage: a in phi.domain()
True
sage: phi(a)
```


and I get
[...]

```

I added some code to depreciate to old method center for group algebras, and replace it by center_basis which gives a center in the good category using the generic method of finite_dimensional_algebra_on_basis.

```
sage: Z = SymmetricGroup(4).algebra(QQ).center()
sage: Z.category()
Join of Category of finite dimensional algebras with basis over Rational Field and Category of commutative algebras over Rational Field and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of subobjects of sets

These problems could be fixed by deleting the algebra method in sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_named.py. It might be something recent because it was working at the time I wrote the failing doctest.
The problem is that this method calls SymmetricGroupAlgebra instead of letting the general one.

So far and to my humble opinion, why keeping SymmetricGroupAlgebra which brings, to my eyes, only troubles as the general algebra method works perfectly?

This line in `categories/objects.py`:

```

should be

```

I think creation of the axiom 'semisimple' and the (perhaps somewhat of shell) categories for semisimple groups and algebras should be done as a dependency ticket for better separation of concerns (and is a part we can split off and review more easily).

Hi Travis,

Thanks for investigating this!

Replying to [comment:28 tscrim]:
> Because it offers much more functionality that the general algebra doesn't and previously the functionality that you want of the general algebra wasn't used. Half of the failures are trivial due to output format, the others, except the check in `SemisimpleAlgebras` (should just be a matter of setting the right category), can be solved by implementing a `conjugacy_classes` method for `StandardPermutations_n` (there was talk about implementing this specifically for permutations without appealing to GAP and would fix the problem).

Reverting SymmetricGroup.algebra to not return SymmetricGroupAlgebra
is now #16925. See there for the rationale, but essentially
SymmetricGroupAlgebra is not a drop-in replacement, and breaks too
many assumptions that generic code about group algebras will want to
do. See you there if this needs to be further discussed.

I have made #16925 a dependency of this ticket.

See #16926 for a plan to have all implementations of the group algebra
of the symmetric group benefit from the cool features of
SymmetricGroupAlgebra.

This is now fixed (actually in the #10668 dependency). Thanks for
catching though!

> I think creation of the axiom 'semisimple' and the (perhaps somewhat of shell) categories for semisimple groups and algebras should be done as a dependency ticket for better separation of concerns (and is a part we can split off and review more easily).

Possibly so. Now this ticket is already floating on a pile of
dependency which are somewhat of a pain to maintain (e.g. for merging
in beta on a regular basis). And separating the stuff would take a bit
of work. So I would not bother too much about this.

I am temporarily putting it to needs review to get reports from the build bot. Also, most of the code won't change much and can already be reviewed.

There are some failing doctests around steenrod/quiver algebras that I need to fix in #8678.
I also have this on my list:

- [ ] Make span return a true submodule rather than a FreeModule;
- [ ] Adapt annihilator accordingly;

Hello Nicolas,

I'm almost done reviewing this. The patch looks great! I've made some "improvements" to the documentation, please take a look.

Here are a few remaining questions:

1. First of all, I'm not sure what the commit cfe399d is all about. Was it some sort of auto-merge by git?

2. `categories/finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.py`: the docstring of `quotient_module` talks about quotient "free" module. What do you mean by free?

3. `categories/semisimple_algebras.py`: what do you mean by "TODO: trivial implementations for semisimple_quotient"

4. `combinat/free_module.py`: `_order_cmp` requires a docstring

5. `combinat/free_module.py` has a method called `echelon_form`, which is very similar to `echelonize` from `categories/modules_with_basis.py`. They essential do the same thing except that `echelon_form` allows one to specify a `base_ring`. Should these be merged? or eliminate one of them?

    "body": "Replying to [comment:65 saliola]:\n> I'm almost done reviewing this. The patch looks great! I've made some \"improvements\" to the documentation, please take a look.\n\nI double checked your changes, thanks!\n\n> Here are a few remaining questions:\n> \n> 1. First of all, I'm not sure what the commit cfe399d is all about. Was it some sort of auto-merge by git?\n\nSounds like we both merged in 6.7.beta0 and that was a merge of our\nmerges ...\n\n> 2. `categories/finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.py`: the docstring of `quotient_module` talks about quotient \"free\" module. What do you mean by free?\n\nI agree, the phrasing is not great. The point that needs to be\nhighlighted is that this only handles quotients by free submodules\nadmitting a unitriangular row echelon form, so that the quotient is\nagain a free module. Any proposition of rewording is welcome!\n\n> 3. `categories/semisimple_algebras.py`: what do you mean by \"TODO: trivial implementations for semisimple_quotient\"\n\nErr, good point, I don't really know. I guess all the methods that\nbecome trivial in this category, like is_semisimple, ... Maybe we can\njust remove this comment.\n\n> 4. `combinat/free_module.py`: `_order_cmp` requires a docstring\n\nDone.\n\n> 5. `combinat/free_module.py` has a method called `echelon_form`, which is very similar to `echelonize` from `categories/modules_with_basis.py`. They essential do the same thing except that `echelon_form` allows one to specify a `base_ring`. Should these be merged? or eliminate one of them?\n\nOops, good catch.

I double checked your changes, thanks!

> 1. First of all, I'm not sure what the commit cfe399d is all about. Was it some sort of auto-merge by git?

Sounds like we both merged in 6.7.beta0 and that was a merge of our
merges ...

> 2. `categories/finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.py`: the docstring of `quotient_module` talks about quotient "free" module. What do you mean by free?

I agree, the phrasing is not great. The point that needs to be
highlighted is that this only handles quotients by free submodules
admitting a unitriangular row echelon form, so that the quotient is
again a free module. Any proposition of rewording is welcome!

> 3. `categories/semisimple_algebras.py`: what do you mean by "TODO: trivial implementations for semisimple_quotient"

Err, good point, I don't really know. I guess all the methods that
become trivial in this category, like is_semisimple, ... Maybe we can
just remove this comment.

> 4. `combinat/free_module.py`: `_order_cmp` requires a docstring

Done.

> 5. `combinat/free_module.py` has a method called `echelon_form`, which is very similar to `echelonize` from `categories/modules_with_basis.py`. They essential do the same thing except that `echelon_form` allows one to specify a `base_ring`. Should these be merged? or eliminate one of them?

Oops, good catch. I merged the two of them as `echelon_form` in the
category. I deleted the `base_ring` feature which seems useless and
dangerous (the resulting vectors had coefficient in the specified
base_ring but injected back into the original module). We probably
don't need to go through a deprecation period for a broken "feature"
like this.

Running long tests now.

```

Running the long tests on `sage.math.u-psud.fr` triggered the following failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/expect.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/parallel/decorate.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/sagedev.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/test.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/misc/temporary_file.py  # 5 doctests failed
```


All of them passed smoothly when I reran them with:

```
sage -t --long --failed src/sage
```


So I assume it was just a transient issue due to the machine being under heavy load.

Hence, positive review!

Thanks a lot everyone, and in particular Franco!

That was a long story from Sage Days 20.5 to Sage Days 67 :-)
