Only two remaining issues that are going to need more help from experts:

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py  # 15 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_generic.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_endomorphism_utils.py  # 4 doctests failed
```

These are caused by the changes in gp's `genus2red` output from https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=a41e4fa95925eae42830217313583efc80628763

Sage's `genus2reduction.py` needs to be adapted to those changes.


```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py  # 1 doctest failed
```


This is a weird issue that involves pari and gap code. Needs further investigation.

OK, from a closer look it looks like this is just caused by a different choice of generators for the orthogonal group. Replacing

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.0) == Oq(OL.0.matrix())
```

with

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.1) == Oq(OL.1.matrix())
```

gives the same failure with pari 2.13. So, even though this looks like an actual issue, it is not a regression from the pari update, it just happened to work by chance before due to a different matrix being tested. I think we should just flag this as known bug and proceed with this.

> pari 2.15.1 is out, see https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-announce-22/msg00002.html

Pari 2.15.1 includes the fix I cherry picked in my last comment.

The current HEAD of cypari2 already fied testsuite passes on pari 2.15, and Vincent said he will do a release soon.

It would be very nice if this can be merged for 9.8.

and ensuing error in this file have nothing to do with Pari.
Are we still supporting 32-bit seriously? 
Indeed, these 32-bit errors should have been caught elsewhere.


I wonder whether Pari 2.15.1 passes its selftests on 32-bit, too.

The offending Pari commit, reverted by Gonzalo's patch, is not in 2.13.3, but is in 2.15.1.
Maybe it flips FPU switches somewhere...

Precisely. The 387 fpu has a switch to choose between 64-bit (double) and 80-bit (long double) arithmetic. The problem is that transcendental functions depend on 80 bit arithmetic to give accurate 64 bit results 🤦‍♂️

Just linking to pari (without even initializing it) will affect a program, as demonstrated in the test program in my commit message (https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/pari/patches/float32.patch).

Maybe it is possible to override the -mpc64 setting in pari library by explicitly adding -mpc80 to the linking step of sage. Or adding code in sage init to explicitly initialize the FPU to a safe mode.

Be warned that removing the `-mpc64` flag in pari might result in some numerical differences on pari itself due to 80 bit precission. In void linux we compile pari with `-ffloat-store` which avoids this issue.

should we proceed with the Gonzalo's patch ? 

the upstream is clearly wrong in applying this change unconditionally, IMHO
