The title starts with "An Optimal Algorithm - -". Would it give a false impression that Sage implements that algorithm? (OK, there is a clear solution for this problem...) And is it freely available for all, or do I see because I am located at university network?

I do not know a very good reference. There are several papers, none of which seems to be The Paper.
