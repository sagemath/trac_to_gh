Assignee: tbd

CC:  jpflori

Currently there are two functions for testing whether an integer is a perfect power:

```
sage: 8.is_power()
True
sage: 8.is_perfect_power()
True
```


* This patch deprecates `is_perfect_power`.
* It implements a new function, `perfect_power`, wrapping Pari's `ispower` function, expressing an integer in the form a<sup>b</sup> with `b` maximal.  This revealed a bug in Pari for negative even powers: I'm in the process of reporting it.
* It adds cross references between `is_power`, `is_power_of`, `is_prime_power` and `perfect_power`.

I like this a lot.

Silly questions:
* `cdef int exp = 1` in the second hunk - since 

```
sage: type(4.perfect_power()[0])
sage.rings.integer.Integer
```

  and you now reassign `exp` to that, does that line make any sense at all? It's certainly not an int.
* Do we need to deprecate `base_exponent`?  It would be easy enough, basically same code as deprecating `is_power` except reverse the order of the output.

I think Cython is smart enough to figure out what's going on here since Integer has an `__int__` method.  You can see in the generated C code for `exp, b = b.perfect_power()` (leaving out lots of error checking and reference counting):


```
__pyx_t_1 = PyObject_GetAttr(__pyx_v_b, __pyx_n_s__perfect_power);
__pyx_t_7 = PyObject_Call(__pyx_t_1, ((PyObject *)__pyx_empty_tuple), NULL);
PyObject* sequence = __pyx_t_7;
Py_ssize_t size = Py_SIZE(sequence);
__pyx_t_1 = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(sequence, 0);
__pyx_t_11 = __Pyx_PyInt_AsInt(__pyx_t_1);
__pyx_v_exp = __pyx_t_11;
```


>  * Do we need to deprecate `base_exponent`?  It would be easy enough, basically same code as deprecating `is_power` except reverse the order of the output.

It's probably a good idea.  I'll do it shortly.

Everything checks out. Patch applies, tests pass. However:

```
def perfect_power(self): 
    r""" 	         
    Returns ``(a, b)``, where this integer is `b^a` and `a` is maximal.
    ...
```

So

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(14, 11)
```

I know the code just wraps PARI which returns the integers in this order, but this seems an unnatural way to order the returned pair.

I've uploaded a modified version of the patch so that we get

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(11, 14)
```

which feels a lot more natural.

The new patch also fixes a possible formatting error in the documentation of `self.is_perfect_power()`:

```
Returns ``True`` if self is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
a and b, `b > 1` with `\texttt{self} = a^b`.
```

becomes

```
Returns ``True`` if ``self`` is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
`a` and `b`, `b > 1` with ``self`` `= a^b`.
```

We missed another line. In `self.factor_aurifeuillian()` in factorint.pyx, we have

```
...
b = n + x
exp, b = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```

This must now become

```
...
b = n + x
b, exp = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```

otherwise this method breaks with the new ordering of values returned by `perfect_power()`. I've uploaded a new patch that fixes this.

Hopefully that should be it.
