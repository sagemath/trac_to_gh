# Issue 11944: perfect_power for integers

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2011-12-04 04:43:15

Assignee: tbd

CC:  jpflori

Currently there are two functions for testing whether an integer is a perfect power:

```
sage: 8.is_power()
True
sage: 8.is_perfect_power()
True
```


 * This patch deprecates `is_perfect_power`.
 * It implements a new function, `perfect_power`, wrapping Pari's `ispower` function, expressing an integer in the form a<sup>b</sup> with `b` maximal.  This revealed a bug in Pari for negative even powers: I'm in the process of reporting it.
 * It adds cross references between `is_power`, `is_power_of`, `is_prime_power` and `perfect_power`.

Here's the response from the Pari developers:


```
The 2 problems turned out to be independant. They are now fixed in the
'testing' branch, in the following 2 commits:

commit f53eb2a7c79922ac51423e75044722628893159e
Author: Karim Belabas <Karim.Belabas`@`math.u-bordeaux1.fr>
Date:   Sun Dec 4 17:43:19 2011 +0100

   46- ispower(1 / n) return a wrong result [#1259]

commit 74aef498d380979211b99d64f4f4c92b8bac853f
Author: Karim Belabas <Karim.Belabas`@`math.u-bordeaux1.fr>
Date:   Sun Dec 4 17:28:14 2011 +0100

   45- ispower(x < 0) could return an even value ! [#1259]
```


That was quick.  :-)

I'm curious why you didn't use the Sphinx seealso directive: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/para.html#directive-seealso

No good reason.

Apply 12116.2.patch only.

Sadly roed's patch conflicts with #10596 and thus doesn't apply to the current Sage beta. I've just uploaded a rebased patch based on 5.0.beta7. This makes no changes to roed's code other than some minor sphinx reformatting (including using the new :trac: directive to point to this ticket). David: if you're happy with my reworking of your patch, you can set this to positive review.

Thanks for rebasing!  I looked it over and it looks good to me.

The upstream fix is in Sage now (#12363).  Could you remove the workaround code from the patch?

Can we have a new option for the "Report Upstream" menu, "upstream claim to have fixed it but they apparently haven't"? PARI apparently believes that ` 2^3 = -8 `:


```
                                      GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.5.1 (development git-5c5e253)

parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500509

```


So I suggest we merge this patch as it is, and send another bug report to PARI -- roed, can you do the honours?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2012-03-12 16:34:48

I reported the new issue upstream.  I would postpone merging this patch until we hear from upstream.  I prefer to have the issue fixed upstream and not apply a work-around in Sage.

Comment by davidloeffler created at 2012-03-12 16:39:07

Oops -- I also just filed a bug report, after hearing from David R that he's currently busy conference-ing. Oh well, no harm is done if they get two reports of the same bug.

The PARI patch has been, I will provide a patched spkg at #12638.

Patched PARI spkg at #12638 ready for review.

Is still work needed? Or a review?


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-03-17 08:43:39

I think Jeroen suggested that this ticket should depend on #12638 and remove the PARI workaround.  I'll try to put up a patch at some point.


---

Comment by roed created at 2012-10-15 09:21:01

I've updated this to remove the PARI workaround and import deprecated_function_alias from sage.misc.superceded rather than sage.misc.misc.

I like this a lot.

Silly questions:
 * `cdef int exp = 1` in the second hunk - since 

```
sage: type(4.perfect_power()[0])
sage.rings.integer.Integer
```

  and you now reassign `exp` to that, does that line make any sense at all? It's certainly not an int.
 * Do we need to deprecate `base_exponent`?  It would be easy enough, basically same code as deprecating `is_power` except reverse the order of the output.

I think Cython is smart enough to figure out what's going on here since Integer has an `__int__` method.  You can see in the generated C code for `exp, b = b.perfect_power()` (leaving out lots of error checking and reference counting):


```
__pyx_t_1 = PyObject_GetAttr(__pyx_v_b, __pyx_n_s__perfect_power);
__pyx_t_7 = PyObject_Call(__pyx_t_1, ((PyObject *)__pyx_empty_tuple), NULL);
PyObject* sequence = __pyx_t_7;
Py_ssize_t size = Py_SIZE(sequence);
__pyx_t_1 = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(sequence, 0);
__pyx_t_11 = __Pyx_PyInt_AsInt(__pyx_t_1);
__pyx_v_exp = __pyx_t_11;
```


>  * Do we need to deprecate `base_exponent`?  It would be easy enough, basically same code as deprecating `is_power` except reverse the order of the output.

It's probably a good idea.  I'll do it shortly.

Flips order of returned pair in self.perfect_power()

Everything checks out. Patch applies, tests pass. However:

```
def perfect_power(self): 
    r""" 	         
    Returns ``(a, b)``, where this integer is `b^a` and `a` is maximal.
    ...
```

So

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(14, 11)
```

I know the code just wraps PARI which returns the integers in this order, but this seems an unnatural way to order the returned pair.

I've uploaded a modified version of the patch so that we get

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(11, 14)
```

which feels a lot more natural.

The new patch also fixes a possible formatting error in the documentation of `self.is_perfect_power()`:

```
Returns ``True`` if self is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
a and b, `b > 1` with `\texttt{self} = a^b`.
```

becomes

```
Returns ``True`` if ``self`` is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
`a` and `b`, `b > 1` with ``self`` `= a^b`.
```

Looks fine to me.  I just updated the `deprecated_function_alias`.

Changed a line to unbreak factor_aurifeuillian() in factorint.pyx


---

Comment by spice created at 2013-03-01 01:49:49

We missed another line. In `self.factor_aurifeuillian()` in factorint.pyx, we have

```
...
b = n + x
exp, b = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```

This must now become

```
...
b = n + x
b, exp = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```

otherwise this method breaks with the new ordering of values returned by `perfect_power()`. I've uploaded a new patch that fixes this.

Hopefully that should be it.
