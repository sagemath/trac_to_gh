# Issue 31183: Review/remove monkey patching in src/sage/__init__.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31420

To make `sage` a namespace package, we need to get rid of `src/sage/__init__.py`.

It currently contains:
- definition of __all__
- definition of __version__
- preloading of zlib
- `load_ipython_extension`
- monkey patching of `inspect.isfunction` to support Cython functions
- monkey patching of sqlite on Cygwin

We should review all of them, remove anything that is not needed any more, and move the rest to other module inits if possible.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

It seems that removing `__version__` and `__all__` is harmless. I don't know about the `zlib` issue: I tried moving the import to `all.py` and everything worked, but that's hardly an exhaustive test.

We can probably move it (and also the `sqlite` monkey-patching on cygwin) to a module that is loaded very early such as `sage.cpython.__init__`.

Do you also want `del _sys`?

Where does the `del _zlib` come from in `sage/cpython/__init__.py`? It wasn't present in `sage/__init__.py` and the ticket above that group only talks about `import zlib`. Is mentioning that ticket obsolete? Is the whole block obsolete when we favor system zlib whenever possible?

The `del` introduced in `af6642f` just removes the binding of the name `_zlib` created by the `import` statement from the `sage.cpython` module. Likewise the other `del`s in this commit.

Call me obtuse, why do you import and then delete straight away? Is it a cleaner way to make sure that the right library is loaded while you may not want it around in this particular unit?

The importing there is just to trigger loading some shared library.
One could use a function from `importlib` instead of using `import` but that's a tiny bit more obscure
