CC:  @kiwifb @jhpalmieri @embray

To make `sage` a namespace package, we need to get rid of `src/sage/__init__.py`.

It currently contains:
- definition of __all__
- definition of __version__
- preloading of zlib
- `load_ipython_extension`
- monkey patching of `inspect.isfunction` to support Cython functions
- monkey patching of sqlite on Cygwin

We should review all of them, remove anything that is not needed any more, and move the rest to other module inits if possible.

It seems that removing `__version__` and `__all__` is harmless. I don't know about the `zlib` issue: I tried moving the import to `all.py` and everything worked, but that's hardly an exhaustive test.

The importing there is just to trigger loading some shared library.
One could use a function from `importlib` instead of using `import` but that's a tiny bit more obscure
