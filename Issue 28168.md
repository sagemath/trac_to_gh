# Issue 28168: correct the test for galpol package in pari's spkg-configure.m4

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28405

the test written there

```
if test "x$gp_galp_check = xC3\ \:\ C4"; then
```

always evaluates to true.
It is meant to check whether `gp_galp_check` equals the string
`"C3 : C4"`

my patchy knowledge of autoconf/m4/shell syntax does not suffice, please help...

Shouldn't it be

```
"x$gp_galp_check" = "xC3 : C4"
```

?

I've moved the test into the call to gp, now it works.

I can confirm the issue and that this ticket correctly detects that galpol is not installed.
