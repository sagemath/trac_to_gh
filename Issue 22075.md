# Issue 22075: Eulerian numbers versus Euler numbers in documentation.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pluschny

Original creation time: 2017-02-06 10:36:12

CC:  jmantysalo tscrim

Eulerian numbers are http://oeis.org/A008292 whereas Euler numbers are http://oeis.org/A000364 . 

The doc-page "Combinatorial Functions" lump them together creating maximal confusion: 

"Eulerian/Euler numbers, euler_number() (Maxima)"

Solution: Delete "Eulerian/" in the complained sentence.
