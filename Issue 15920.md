Hmm, this requires a system install of git. Is there any other (sensible) way we could cleanup the bad directories?

I thought about it but Solaris find of course doesn't understand `-empty` so the easiest option is probably a python script...

Or some flavour of

```sh
find /path/to/root -depth -type d -exec rmdir -ps {} \;
```

Probably

```sh
find /path/to/root -depth -type d -exec rmdir {} 2>/dev/null \;
```

would be more portable.

This breaks `make distclean` if no system-wide `git` is available; cf. follow-up #16303.
