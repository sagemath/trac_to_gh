Hi Frédéric,
I approve of the update and what you have in mind but there is more work to do here.  Do you propose to deprecate the old input methods (labeled Dyck word, labeling/area sequence)?  Should we add methods `from_labeled_dyckword`, etc.  There should definitely be some documentation in class `ParkingFunction`.  What do you propose to do with `ParkingFunction_old`?
