Changing keywords from "" to "DS_Store, rpy2".

Seems ok.  Works on OS X  and sage.math.

I'm wondering whether 

```

 == Special Update/Build Instructions ==
  * setup.py change takes care of a few parsing issues and location issues
  * does this need to be reported upstream, or is it Sage-specific?
+ * #13603: Removed src/.DS_Store
```


should have just instructions to remove that if present, like the other bullet points in similar lists.

In retrospect, actually this message should be in the SPKG.txt log, not under instructions, unless it was in upstream, which I can hardly believe (we or I must have introduced it).

Note that now we have r-2.14.0.p6.spkg, and it seems to be gone. 

```
$ ls -aR | grep DS_Store
```

Also, apparently 2.7.1 R introduced

```

    o   R CMD build tries harder to clean up the inst/doc directory
        from the remnants of earlier builds.

        It also removes any directories with extension .Rcheck, and
        files .DS_Store and ._* (created by tar on Mac OS X under some
        circumstances: it now sets environment variables to ask for
        such files not to be created by that tar.)
```

So I think we can close this.  Sorry your spkg didn't get in, Paul-Olivier!  Though I guess I'm glad this was taken care of _up_stream.
