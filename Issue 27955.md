There are various failures, for sure the `src/sage/doctest/tests` contains test fixtures and isn't supposed to be tested individually.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/tests/atexit.rst  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/tests/fail_and_die.rst  # Killed due to kill signal
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/tests/initial.rst  # 5 doctests failed
```
