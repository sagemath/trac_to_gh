Installing the ChomP package causes `ChainComplex` to give different (and basically wrong) answers.  Here are two examples from the doctests:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex([matrix(ZZ, 1, 1, [2]), matrix(ZZ, 1, 1), matrix(1, 1, [3])])
sage: C.torsion_list(5)
[(2, []), (3, [])]   # Should be [(2, [1]), (3, [3])]
sage: S = simplicial_complexes.SumComplex(17, [0, 1, 4])
sage: S.homology(1)
0    # Should be C140183
```

May be related to #12607 where installing ChomP causes certain 0 dimensional homology groups not to be reported.

I poked around a bit.  In the first example, the issue seems to be that the wrapper is misparsing the correct output of "homchain".  In the second example, "homchain" outputs the following abort message (due to integer overflow, I think) which is ignored by the wrapper.

Several comments: first, there is a new version of CHomP: see https://github.com/shaunharker/CHomP, but it does not fix these problems (at least the second one: the first is a problem with Sage's interface with CHomP, so that's our fault).

We probably should fix #12607 now that optional spkgs are always tested, and we can do a version bump of CHomP (along with making it a new-style spkg).

And the second looks indeed like an overflow error in a product inside CHomP. This works

```
sage: S = simplicial_complexes.SumComplex(17, [0, 1, 4])
sage: S.homology(algorithm='chomp',verbose=True,base_ring=GF(103))
```

How should we catch the errors of CHomP ?
