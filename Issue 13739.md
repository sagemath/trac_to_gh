# Issue 13739: automorphisms of simplicial complexes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2013-01-11 15:34:43

Assignee: jhpalmieri

Keywords: simplicial automorphism

It would be good to have a method to compute the automorphism group of a simplicial complex.

This patch implements that.

Better version, acting on vertices. Thanks, Nathann !

This patch implements that.

And also a procedure to check wether two simplicial complexes are isomorphic.

Excellent ! Well, it seems good to go, it will certainly be useful eventually, and at the very least in #13888. Passes all tests, does its job `:-)`

Sphinx is unhappy:

```
/release/merger/sage-5.7.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py:docstring of sage.homology.simplicial_complex:3: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

I think I have corrected the sphinx issue in the new patch.

Just checked again, and there's no warning... Sorry for that `^^;`

I have tried to make more intrinsic doctests, and I hope they will pass.

new patch, with good tests

Well, it looks good to me again. The first dictionary in the doctests should not be a problem as the hash function of an integer is the integer itself, and the other tests are now isomorphism tests, returning True/False.

Sooooooooo I guess it's good to go again !
