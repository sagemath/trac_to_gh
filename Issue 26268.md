In this ticket we:
- use method `c_distances_all_pairs` to speed up initialization and reduce memory consumption (before, the distance matrix was stored in a dict of dict)
- use a binary matrix to simplify some parts of the code (initialization and deallocation)
- clean the file (PEP8)

Trick: you can save the + signs here:

```
            raise ValueError("this is currenly implemented for Graphs only, "+
                             "but only minor updates are needed if you want "+
                             "to make it support DiGraphs too")
```
and just write:

```
            raise ValueError("this is currently implemented for Graphs only, "
                             "but only minor updates are needed if you want "
                             "to make it support DiGraphs too")
```
(while you're at it, fix "currenly" -> "currently" in this ValueError message).
