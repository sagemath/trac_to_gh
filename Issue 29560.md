     Converts a root string into a tuple of variable names by adding 
     numbers in sequence.

Also, minor nitpick with the doc formatting:

```diff

-       output.
-    - ``names`` a string (Default: ``None``); The root of the variable
-      name.

+    - ``names`` a string (default: ``None``); the root of the variable
+      name.
```

Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I am -1 on this change because it is actually slower (surprisingly) to not have the inner list comprehension.

Indeed! There's no "tuple comprehension" in python; just the possibility to make a tuple from an iterator. You can save the "tuple" by writing

```
(*[...],)
```

but as far as I can see this has about the same performance as `tuple([...])` has. I guess the tuple constructor misses some of the optimizations of list comprehensions to build a list with beforehand-unknown-length. Passing a list into tuple gives the length beforehand, so it's easier to construct the tuple efficiently.
