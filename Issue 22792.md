Building Sage 8.0.beta7 on Cygwin fails with:


```
[sagelib-8.0.beta7] In file included from
../local/include/linbox/algorithms/bbcharpoly.h:45:0,
[sagelib-8.0.beta7]                  from
../local/include/linbox/solutions/charpoly.h:34,
[sagelib-8.0.beta7]                  from
build/cythonized/sage/libs/linbox/linbox_flint_interface.cpp:572:
[sagelib-8.0.beta7] ../local/include/linbox/solutions/det.h: In
function ‘typename Blackbox::Field::Element& LinBox::det(typename
Blackbox::Field::Element&, const Blackbox&, const
LinBox::RingCategories::ModularTag&, const Wiedemann&)’:
[sagelib-8.0.beta7] ../local/include/linbox/solutions/det.h:239:39:
error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant
[sagelib-8.0.beta7]      Compose<Blackbox,Diagonal<Field> > B0 (&A, &D);
```


This is similar to a problem that's come up before in [fflas-ffpack](https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/57), where `B0` is a macro defined in `termios.h`.  This header is not explicitly included anywhere, but but it happens to be included indirectly in some cases on Cygwin.

**Upstream:** https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/pull/54
