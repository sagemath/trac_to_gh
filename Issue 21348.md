CC:  chapoton

This sounds natural:


```
g.relabel(Permutations(g.order()).random_element())
```


but it stops with `TypeError: i (= 0) must be between 1 and 4`. That is because actually a "permutation" used as an argument is an element of permutation group. This should be either documented better or maybe changed.

Also `g.relabel()` works, but it should be explicitly said that it is not any kind of canonical relabeling.

This is working well if vertices are integers in range 0..n-1. However, for other labelings, it has either no effect

```
sage: g = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,3)
sage: print g.edges(labels=0)

I modelled the behaviour from what we already have for an element of a permutation group. It is also mentioned in the docstring.

But how should this behave?

It is basically just


```
ddict = {}
for i in range(1,n):
    ddict[i] = perm(i)%n
```


So, I mark this as needs_review.

No, it's not. I added some print commands to understand where it goes:
- For any graph, when using `g.relabel(Permutations(g.vertices()).random_element())`, the input permutation `perm` is seen as a `list` or `tuple`
- For any graph, when using `g.relabel(Permutations(g.order()).random_element())`, the input permutation `perm` is seen as `PermutationGroupElement` or `Permutation`

Indeed, we have:

```
sage: isinstance(Permutations(g.vertices()).random_element(), list)
True
```


Actually, I don't know what we should expect from method `random_element` since it is not properly documented.

```
sage: p = Permutations(g.order())
sage: p.random_element??
Signature: p.random_element()
Source:   
    def random_element(self):
        """
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Permutations(4).random_element()
            [1, 2, 4, 3]
        """
        return self.element_class(self, sample(range(1,self.n+1), self.n))
File:      ~/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/permutation.py
Type:      instancemethod
sage: isinstance(p.random_element(), list)
False
```



So the behavior you propose should not be allowed, but you can document `g.relabel(Permutations(g.vertices()).random_element())` which is a nice way to get a random relabeling of the graph.
