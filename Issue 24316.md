Pynac-0.7.16 offers `legendre_P()`. The performance increase:

```
             Python+Pari        Pynac
             -----------        -----
sage: _=legendre_P(10,x)      510 µs           29 µs
sage: _=legendre_P(100,x)     2.3 ms           290 µs
sage: _=legendre_P(1000,x)    28 ms            3.5 ms
sage: _=legendre_P(10000,x)   1.1 s            110 ms
sage: _=legendre_P(50000,x)   30 s             2.1 s
```

overall a speedup of a comfortable order of magnitude.
