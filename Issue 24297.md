# Issue 24297: Mysterious hang in linbox after fork on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The following test reproduces the problem reliably (for me) in Sage 8.1 (plus one tiny patch needed for psutil to build, which has no runtime effect):


```python
from sage.all import *
import os
import sys

def test():
    return random_matrix(ZZ, 30).determinant(algorithm='linbox',
                                             proof=False)

if os.fork() == 0:
    print('in child; the determinant is: %s' % test())
    sys.stdout.flush()
else:
    print('in parent; the determinant is: %s' % test())
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print('waiting for child')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    print(os.wait())
    sys.stdout.flush()
```


This is especially mysterious for a few reasons:

1) I never saw this error before, and I only first starting noticing after I upgraded my Windows machine to the "Windows 10 Fall Creators Update".  That may just be a coincidence though.

2) The issue _does not_ occur when I run the [SageMath](SageMath) 8.1 binary for Windows I built a few weeks ago.  I made that build before my Windows update, but running it on the updated Windows has no issue.  The Cygwin version is the same in both cases.

3) All of linbox's `make check` tests pass--I'm not sure if any of them deal with fork, however.

So this is only happening currently in my development Cygwin, and not in a previously built binary.  This suggests to me some kind of problem occurring at build time but it's hard to say yet.

Another data point: Although in my test above the child just _hangs_, I do see in strace an attempt to call `open()` with an invalid filename pointer, and it also reports an access violation, but then just...hangs.  That might be a Cygwin bug, somehow.

But there's another test that is resulting in a seemingly related segfault (along with several other tests in the same module):

Ahah, it seems that when I last upgraded my Cygwin installation it also installed openblas, and I'm being bitten by this again: #22822.

That also explains why I'm not having the same problem from my installer binaries.  This ticket can be closed, then, since it's not really an issue with linbox, and originates from another known issue (I've confirmed that the relevant code in LinBox is called threaded versions of routines in openblas).
