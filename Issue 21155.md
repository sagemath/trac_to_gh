# Issue 21155: Polynomial should implement quo_rem

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21392

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2016-09-01 15:54:26

There are implementations of `quo_rem()` in `Polynomial_generic_dense` and the like, but not in the `Polynomial` base class itself, so that specialized implementations of polynomials must implement it to workâ€”while `Polynomial` does provide `_add_`, `_mul_` etc.

how could this be fixed long before the ticket was open ?

Uh, good question! Apparently it has **not** been fixed: the ticket I am linking to adds a `quo_rem()` method to `Polynomial_generic_dense`, not `Polynomial`.

Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
