Keywords: manifolds, tensor fields, scalar fields, mixed forms

The zero element is always a special element. Therefore it should be treated as such. It should shorten computations and certainly be immutable. This ticket is devoted to that topic. (Similarly for the one element in the scalar field and mixed form algebra).

This ticket is part of the metaticket #28519.

The code snippet (see commits 5d30100 and â€‹d949a13) was quite messy. Well, it still is. At least it is readable and works for now. It gets a little bit better after merging (see #28519).

I will think about a better solution. But I guess, this requires a complete reorganization of the mixed form code.

sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2

sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V

sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: e_xy = c_xy.frame(); e_uv = c_uv.frame()

This is an example of how I used `add_comp_by_continuation` in the doctest. Obviously, this is a *bad* example. To ensure the "immutability" of mixed forms, the `comp` attribute should be used for already fully defined differential forms only. Whenever a incremental definition is explicitly wanted, `F[1][e_xy,0] = x` or `F[1] = M.one_form({e_xy: [x,0]}, name='omega')` should be used instead, and **then** `add_comp_by_continuation` is reasonable to use.

At least, that is my suggestion of how to use mixed forms.

Travis? Would you agree?

Mh. Sorry for that. I try again: The thing in the example above is that the zero element gets manipulated via `add_comp_by_continuation`, or `set_restriction` respectively. This indicates, the whole example (even if there is no zero element involved) is a bad use of this methods.

Better would be:

sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                intersection_name='W', restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: e_xy = c_xy.frame(); e_uv = c_uv.frame()
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x, name='f')
sage: f.add_expr_by_continuation(c_uv, U.intersection(V))
sage: omega = M.diff_form(1, name='omega')
sage: omega[e_xy,0] = x
sage: omega.add_comp_by_continuation(e_uv, U.intersection(V), c_uv)
sage: F = M.mixed_form(name='F', comp=[f, omega, 0])
```


Yet, I noticed that `add_comp_by_continuation` seems not being convenient at all.

I guess it depends on how you define zero. Although if I think of this like a graded module, `0` exists in all graded parts simultaneously, so by analogy, the `add_comp_by_continuation` does work correctly.

Yes, you're absolutely right. So, seeing things more from the mathematical point of view is always the way to go, right?

The problem here is that `add_comp_by_continuation` invokes the `add_comp` method for tensor fields which raises an error when it is used by the zero element. To make it usable in this case, a separate treatment of zero must be implemented.
