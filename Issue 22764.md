# Issue 22764: Implement is_NaN for all rings with NaN elements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23001

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-05-15 08:09:59

Elements of the following rings can't be checked for `NaN`:
  * `CC` (`RR` can)
  * `CDF` (`RDF` can)
  * `CIF` (`RIF` can)
  * `RLF`, `CLF`
  * Ball fields

Other rings don't have `NaN` so there is no need for them.

No problem, they were easy enough to recheck.
