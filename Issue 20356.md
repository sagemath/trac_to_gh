Please revert this one line break and we're good to go:


```
-    g._set_extra_kwds(Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(options, ignore='fontsize'))
+    g._set_extra_kwds(Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(options,
+                                                      ignore='fontsize'))
```


Plots look good!
