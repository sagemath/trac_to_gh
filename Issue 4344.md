How exactly does this apply to the sage codebase?  Should this be posted to the knoboo bug system, since we have no control over their codebase?

It's on here for reference. I did this before once for the "remember me" checkbox. 

I wrote some code last night and will work in the car on it soon.

I agree with Jason that this has nothing to do with Sage and I will close this ticket unless you come up with a good reason why this should stay open.

Cheers,

Michael
