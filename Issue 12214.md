# Issue 12214: [ARM] pickling issues in the matrix_mod2_dense code

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: Snark

Original creation time: 2012-01-30 09:32:34

Assignee: was

As discussed on the sage-devel mailing-list, that code uses "char" to read&write pickles on all platforms.

Unfortunately on ARM, "char" means "unsigned char", while on most other platforms, it means "signed char".

The solution is to make that code use "signed char" explicitly ; that way we unbreak the ARM pickles.

Use "signed char" in matrix_mod2_dense for portability

Changes look reasonable, if this passes tests it should go in. Hence, positive review for now.

Patches should be made using "hg export tip" or similar, not "hg diff".  Please re-upload a proper Mercurial changeset with a meaningful commit message.
