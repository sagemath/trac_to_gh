Please remove 1 occurence of `sage:` from `sage: sage: g = Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph().edges()); g` and then the patch will be good to go ;)

Right, I missed it :(
Nathann, instead of `G.name('complement(%s)'%self.name())` you shouldn't you write `G.name('complement({}).format(self.name()))`?

Doctest fixed it.

I also made the change for `format`, though really I did not change that line, and only indented it.

For me the patch is good to go (passes all tests on my computer, etc.).
