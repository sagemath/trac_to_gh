qepcad interface is based on text strings. Since the switch to python 3, we get bytes object instead, which breaks the interface:


```
sage: from sage.interfaces.qepcad import qepcad_formula
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: form = qepcad_formula.exists(y,x^2+y^2==0)
sage: qepcad(form)

No. I didn't. 

Do we need to ensure compaitibility with python2 now that we have made the switch to python3?

Anyways, as Travis says, it's better to go through the interface carefully and ensure that any place that reads bytes directly from pexpect runs `bytes_to_str` over them before passing them to code that is intended to operate on strings.
