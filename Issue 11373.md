# Issue 11373: sage/tests/interrupt.pyx doctest failures on OS X

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I have seen various people report failures on OS X with the test

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/tests/interrupt.pyx
```

I know the problem is with `test_interrupt_bomb()`, but I cannot tell precisely what is the problem.  It is also annoying that the problem does not appear on all OS X 10.6 systems.
