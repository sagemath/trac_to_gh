CC:  stumpc5 @fchapoton @tscrim

We have

```
sage: WeylGroup("A5").codegrees()
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
sage: Permutations(6).codegrees()
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
sage: ColoredPermutations(1,6).codegrees()
(4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
```

However, there is code assuming the latter ordering.  In particular:

```
sage: WeylGroup("A5").number_of_reflections_of_full_support()
0
sage: ColoredPermutations(1,6).number_of_reflections_of_full_support()
1
```


I don't know which order is better, but this ticked simply removes the dependency on the ordering in `number_of_reflections_of_full_support`.

good point, thanks for catching! (Imho, the codegrees should always be sorted in decreasing order.)

I don't really care on the ordering. When I implemented the colored permutations, the complex reflection group code was not done yet IIRC, and I might just followed Wikipedia.
