# Issue 32683: Evaluation for Ore polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32920

Original creator: @Adurand8

Original creation time: 2021-11-22 00:47:30

CC:  caruso

Keywords: Ore Polynomial, Evaluation

Add the OrePolynomialEvaluation class which take an Ore polynomial P in K[X, sigma, der] and an element c in K. This class represent the morphism P(c*sigma + der).
Add a function in the OrePolynomialElement class which return this evaluation.
Need work : documentation, tests, reworks.
