Keywords: Ore Polynomial, Evaluation

Add the OrePolynomialEvaluation class which take an Ore polynomial P in K[X, sigma, der] and an element c in K. This class represent the morphism P(c*sigma + der).
Add a function in the OrePolynomialElement class which return this evaluation.
Need work : documentation, tests, reworks.
