Very minor heuristic.

After `P = posets.BooleanLattice(8)` compare timings of `P.congruence([This is the Trac macro *0, 1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0, 1-macro))` and `P.congruence([This is the Trac macro *0, 128* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0, 128-macro))` to understand the reason.
