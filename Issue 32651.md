Most substantial code in `sage.groups` depends on libgap.

We introduce a `Feature` for use in `# optional` annotations for doctests that use groups as examples.

The doctest failure:

```

copy pasting the command to test modified files here:

```
sage -tp --show-skipped --long src/sage/features/sagemath.py src/sage/graphs/generators/families.py src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py src/sage/graphs/graph.py src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx src/sage/structure/coerce_actions.pyx src/sage/structure/element.pyx
```
