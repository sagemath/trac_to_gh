`EllipticCurve_number_field` has a `.division_field()` method to compute the smallest field of definition of `E[ℓ]` for primes `ℓ`.

This patch generalizes the `.division_field()` method to finite fields, where the same algorithm works with minor changes.

(It's best to look at the commits individually as the method was moved to a parent class.)

Looks good to me.

I was wondering whether (over any base field) it would be worthwhile first going up to the ell'th cyclotomic extension of the base field since the ell-splitting field will contain that.  But that would take some experimentation, and should not be on this ticket.
