# Issue 33702: compute ℓ-division fields for elliptic curves over finite fields

`EllipticCurve_number_field` has a `.division_field()` method to compute the smallest field of definition of `E[ℓ]` for primes `ℓ`.

This patch generalizes the `.division_field()` method to finite fields, where the same algorithm works with minor changes.

(It's best to look at the commits individually as the method was moved to a parent class.)

LGTM modulo documentation changes:

```diff
-        - ``\ell`` -- a prime number (an element of `\ZZ`).
-
-        - ``names`` -- (default: ``t``) a variable name for the division field.
-
+        - ``\ell`` -- a prime number (an element of `\ZZ`)
+        - ``names`` -- (default: ``t``) a variable name for the division field
         - ``map`` -- (default: ``False``) also return an embedding of
-          the :meth:`base_field` into the resulting field.
-
         - ``kwds`` -- additional keywords passed to
-          :func:`~sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.splitting_field`.
+          :func:`~sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial.splitting_field`
```

Thanks. Done, plus a few other small tweaks.

Looks good to me.

I was wondering whether (over any base field) it would be worthwhile first going up to the ell'th cyclotomic extension of the base field since the ell-splitting field will contain that.  But that would take some experimentation, and should not be on this ticket.
