# Issue 16409: Ordered Set Partitions of size 42

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: elixyre

Original creation time: 2014-07-11 20:29:35

I had the pleasure to remark that to generate *ordered set partitions of size 42* one has to use Word... and for some obscure reason... 

```
sage: type(Word(Permutations(range(3,52)).first()))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.InfiniteWord_iter_with_caching'>
sage: type(Word(range(3,52)))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```

from a permutation of size 42 (>39), the word associated is an infinite word... 

(NOTE: This ticket fix `set_partition_ordered` not `Words`!!)
