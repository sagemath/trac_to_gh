Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: quantum integer

Currently, "negative" quantum integers are only defined for non-negative integers:

```
        sage: q_analogues.q_int(-2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Argument (-2) must be a nonnegative integer.
```
The correct definition is that the quantum integer [n]_q is

                  [n]_q  = { 1+q+...+q!^{n-1}, if n\ge 0
                             { -q!^-n[-n],             if n<0

This patch corrects this. 

Note: prior to trac !#11411 these quantum integers were defined to be zero, and #11411 made made q_int() return a ValueError. Patch !#11411 was motivated by q_binomial() returning incorrect answers. With this patch both q_int() and q_binom() now return correct answers.

This is my first attempt at reviewing a ticket so please let me know if I am breaking any rules...

I just uploaded an update to your patch which addresses the following:
* I tried to correctly format the doc strings (but as I am no export on documentation, it would be good if somebody could check).
* Added an initial check whether n is an integer (previously, q_int(3/2) would result in 0 without complaint).

Because of these changes, I am leaving this ticket as needing review.

Thanks for your review. I agree with all of your suggestions except for changing the return statement when n<0 to:

```
return -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
```
because multiplying polynomials tends to be expensive. Perhaps you thought the previous use of `range(-1,n-1,-1))` wasn't very nice? If so this could be replaced by 

```
return sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])

The updated patch just fixes a tiny latex issue.

Replying to [comment:6 andrew.mathas]:

You're right: I changed the return statement mostly because of "looks" and to make it visibly agree with the documentation.  However, it actually turns out that the new statement is also **much** faster than both the previous one or the one you suggested as an alternative:

```
sage: p = ZZ['q'].gens()[0]
sage: n = -10
sage: %timeit -sum(p**j for j in  range(-1,n-1,-1))
625 loops, best of 3: 972 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 979 µs per loop
sage: %timeit -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 158 µs per loop
sage: n = -100
sage: %timeit -sum(p**j for j in  range(-1,n-1,-1))
25 loops, best of 3: 22.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sum([-p**(n+i) for i in range(-n)])
25 loops, best of 3: 27.6 ms per loop
sage: %timeit -p**n * sum([p**i for i in range(-n)])
625 loops, best of 3: 716 µs per loop
```

I certainly didn't anticipate this.

Thus, I would suggest leaving the two patches as they are.  From my (little) experience, I would say that there is no need to combine the two patches into a single one.  However, I just noted that your patch does not contain the ticket number in the comment line (at the top).  So when changing this, you might as well combine the two patches.
