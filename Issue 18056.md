The new symbols are in the codebase since [May 2010](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=webm/libvpx.git;a=commit;h=b6c71918ae9242f86d7e5b8313c64140c1c8eba3).

So yes, applying the patch unconditionally should be perfectly safe on all sane systems.

Ok, thanks.  Meanwhile checked, even Lucid with still a bit LTS ships 0.9.5 \o/

(Ubuntu is poor in other cases; e.g. 14.04 still ships GNU make 3.81, released 2006.)




In general I'd still check the version before applying version-specific patches.
