So the patch can be applied unconditionally?  (No idea how old libvpx 1.0.0 is.)

The new symbols are in the codebase since [May 2010](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=webm/libvpx.git;a=commit;h=b6c71918ae9242f86d7e5b8313c64140c1c8eba3). They were first released with libvpx [0.9.1](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=webm/libvpx.git;a=tag;h=05049b1aa3c315592c140fd3a17b9cacdde2952e) from June 2010. So yes, applying the patch unconditionally should be perfectly safe on all sane systems.

(Came here from the duplicate #18364).

Ok, thanks.  Meanwhile checked, even Lucid with still a bit LTS ships 0.9.5 \o/

(Ubuntu is poor in other cases; e.g. 14.04 still ships GNU make 3.81, released 2006.)




In general I'd still check the version before applying version-specific patches.
