I think these all qualify for `# long time`. This will help on older machines where this file occasionally hits the default (non `--long`) timeout of 300s.

Mea cu'pa, as these tests are all "mine".  When I implemented this I got rather carries away and put in possibly too many tests, though I seem to remember tagging several "long time" at first.  I perhaps removed the tag from some later, but the actual time taken depends on many lower-level things.  Anyway, I am happy to have more tagged as they are more instructive demos than pure tests.

BUT there does seem to be a regression in there: I would not have tagged that a test takes 500ms if it took >11s.

I'm giving this a positive review since I don't have time now to try to work out why so many of these are so much slower now than when they were written.

Keep in mind that my CPU is from 2008 before you get too worried =)
