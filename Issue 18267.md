# Issue 18267: Git-Trac documentation does not mention git commit

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18504

Original creator: ursula

Original creation time: 2015-05-25 21:56:44

The documentation for "Collaborative Development with Git-Trac" at 

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html

does not mention the git commit command.  Therefore, following these instructions literally will result in the creation and publication of empty trac tickets.

I think this is a great addition to the git documentation for Sage development.
