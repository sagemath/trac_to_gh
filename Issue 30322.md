Currently we have `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi], ...)`, which causes system python3 to be rejected on many systems.

We should review whether this can be made more fine-grained.

`SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` is specifically for checking whether we are going to install a shared library that may interfere with a system-provided version of the same shared library that the package is linked against.

**Package `xz`** represents both the shared library `liblzma` and the `xz` binary. 

```
 grep xz build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/cmake/dependencies:curl zlib bzip2 xz
build/pkgs/gcc/dependencies:| $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc zlib xz
build/pkgs/gdb/dependencies:mpfr zlib ncurses $(PYTHON) xz
build/pkgs/gfortran/dependencies:| $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc zlib xz
build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology/dependencies:$(PYTHON)... | $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN) matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME) ipywidgets
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
build/pkgs/r/dependencies:$(BLAS) gfortran iconv readline bzip2 xz pcre curl | pkgconf
```

In this list, probably some of the dependencies are merely build-time dependencies on the `xz` binary (in particular for unpacking and have nothing to do with the shared library.

It needs to be checked whether this is the case for `python3`.

I don't really understand m4 syntax, but for sqlite, it looks like `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` checks both that `sqlite` as a package has been installed and separately whether the system Python includes an `sqlite` module. Shouldn't just the second of these be good enough?

The "depcheck" macro is used generally for avoiding a problem with conflicting shared libraries. Here, if we install `sqlite` from SPKG for any reason, then we insist that also `python3` must be built from SPKG. Otherwise, the system python's sqlite module is linked to some other libsqlite3, and then IF we load it together with our libsqlite3, this could lead to trouble.

Now, as the ticket summary explains, ACTUALLY we never use our libsqlite3 for anything other than building python3. 

So because of that, I think that we could, as you say, remove the depcheck for sqlite3 from spkg-configure.m4

However, if we ever add another package (providing a shared library linked into a Python module) that ALSO uses libsqlite3, then we would have to put the depcheck back...
