Currently we have `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi], ...)`, which causes system python3 to be rejected on many systems.

We should review whether this can be made more fine-grained.

`SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` is specifically for checking whether we are going to install a shared library that may interfere with a system-provided version of the same shared library that the package is linked against.

*Package `xz`* represents both the shared library `liblzma` and the `xz` binary. 

```
 grep xz build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/cmake/dependencies:curl zlib bzip2 xz
build/pkgs/gcc/dependencies:| $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc zlib xz
build/pkgs/gdb/dependencies:mpfr zlib ncurses $(PYTHON) xz
build/pkgs/gfortran/dependencies:| $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr mpc zlib xz
build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology/dependencies:$(PYTHON)... | $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN) matplotlib gap xz $(SAGERUNTIME) ipywidgets
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
build/pkgs/r/dependencies:$(BLAS) gfortran iconv readline bzip2 xz pcre curl | pkgconf
```

In this list, probably some of the dependencies are merely build-time dependencies on the `xz` binary (in particular for unpacking and have nothing to do with the shared library.

It needs to be checked whether this is the case for `python3`.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to build: configure.

I don't really understand m4 syntax, but for sqlite, it looks like `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` checks both that `sqlite` as a package has been installed and separately whether the system Python includes an `sqlite` module. Shouldn't just the second of these be good enough?

The "depcheck" macro is used generally for avoiding a problem with conflicting shared libraries. Here, if we install `sqlite` from SPKG for any reason, then we insist that also `python3` must be built from SPKG. Otherwise, the system python's sqlite module is linked to some other libsqlite3, and then IF we load it together with our libsqlite3, this could lead to trouble.

Now, as the ticket summary explains, ACTUALLY we never use our libsqlite3 for anything other than building python3. 

So because of that, I think that we could, as you say, remove the depcheck for sqlite3 from spkg-configure.m4

However, if we ever add another package (providing a shared library linked into a Python module) that ALSO uses libsqlite3, then we would have to put the depcheck back...

Moreover, again because python3 is the unique package that uses sqlite3 directly, if system python3 is available, we do not have to build sqlite3 from SPKG even if we don't find system sqlite3.

This is all rather complicated, and I am not sure if our current spkg-configure framework is able to express it cleanly. But I think it would be very valuable to sort it out -- the missing sqlite (headers) are probably the top reason why we might reject python3 at least on macOS

We would have to pay attention if another package were added to use `sqlite3`, but as long as that doesn't happen, couldn't we just duplicate code from `spkg-configure.m4` for `python3` into the one for `sqlite3`? That is, put the checks for a valid system `python3` into the `spkg-configure.m4` script for `sqlite3`, and only if those fail, check to see if there is a valid `sqlite3` package that Sage can use when building its `python3`.

Here's a version that might work

Unfortunately (?), sqlite is no longer broken on my mac running Big Sur, at least according to Sage's `./configure`, so it's a little harder to test this, but if I run `./configure --with-system-sqlite=no`, then without this branch Python gets built, while with it, the system Python 3 is used.

this seems to need testing on Cygwin

The Cygwin tests look okay to me. Shall we merge it?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-11-22 20:57:31

I haven't yet seen a Cygwin test to proceed to actually running Sage because of the general fragility of the multi-stage GH actions (I restarted the workflow several times...). But I think we can proceed anyway, it should not hold up this improvement.
