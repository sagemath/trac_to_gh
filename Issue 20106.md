A comment:

```
t = TikzPicture(latex(transducers.GrayCode()))
t.pdf()
```
does not work as the preamble is not set correctly. However, there is

```
from sage.combinat.finite_state_machine import setup_latex_preamble
setup_latex_preamble()
```
(as well as the corresponding function in `sage.graphs.graph_latex`) to set this correctly, but it seems to be ignored by `TikzPicture`. 

In contrast, 

```
view(transducers.GrayCode())
```
works, but I have no idea if `setup_latex_preamble` is called (not needed to be done manually) or if tikz is included anyways.

As it is now, the user must set the libraries. This should work:

```
t = TikzPicture(latex(transducers.GrayCode()), tikzlibraries=['automata'])
t.pdf()
```

I am still not sure about the proper way to choose the arguments for the `__init__` function and their especially their default values. Should the arguments be empty by default? equal to the current sage latex preamble? or full of a big load of libraries?

I'm not convinced by all the methods `from_dot_string`, `from_graph`, etc. in the class `TikzPicture`. I would say that this code should instead be in the classes implementing the object we want to display. E.g. it could be a method `_tikz_`, just as `_latex_`, and `TikzPicture` just calls it.

Yes, I agree with that option too. Lately, I was thinking more about this option.

But, the module also depends on many things that are in Sage which would make this module quite unusable outside of sage as it is currently. For example:

To check if Graphviz is there:

```
from sage.features.graphviz import Graphviz
```

To check if pdflatex, convert and other programs are available:

```
from sage.misc.latex import have_pdflatex, have_convert, have_program
```

To load the latex macros from sage:

```
from sage.misc.latex import _Latex_prefs
from sage.misc.latex_macros import sage_latex_macros
```

To create a temporary file inside the sage folder of temporary files:

```
from sage.misc.temporary_file import tmp_filename
```

To open viewers:

```
from sage.misc.viewer import browser
from sage.misc.viewer import pdf_viewer
from sage.misc.viewer import png_viewer
```

To check whether we are in the JupyterNotebook or not:

```
from sage.repl.rich_output.backend_ipython import BackendIPythonNotebook
from sage.repl.rich_output.buffer import OutputBuffer
```

The main advantage with that option is that the package can change versions independently of sage.

> But, the module also depends on many things that are in Sage which would make this module quite unusable outside of sage as it is currently. For example:


This would be a Python module that depends on sage. There is nothing bad with that situation. And this is not the only one.

If you want to go in that direction, we need to have a design discussion before spending time changing the graph code. As you know,

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: hasattr(g, '_latex_')
True
```

which returns an object of type:

```
sage: type(latex(g))
<class 'sage.misc.latex.LatexExpr'>
```

This latex expression starts with `\begin{tikzpicture}` and ends with `\end{tikzpicture}` which also depends on `\usepackage{tkz-graph}`:

```
sage: latex(g)
\begin{tikzpicture}                                                                                    
\definecolor{cv0}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}                                                                    
\definecolor{cfv0}{rgb}{1.0,1.0,1.0}                                                                   
...
\Edge[lw=0.1cm,style={color=cv6v9,},](v6)(v9)
\Edge[lw=0.1cm,style={color=cv7v9,},](v7)(v9)
%
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Notice that this output can be provided to `TikzPicture` with no problem with `t = TikzPicture(latex(g), usepackage=['tkz-graph'])` and `t.pdf()` works etc.

I don't think here we want to replace the output of `g._latex_` by an object of type `TikzPicture` since a such change would break a lot of code.

An option is to create a new method `def tikz(self)` instead. I can do something like that. It could return the `TikzPicture(latex(g), usepackage=['tkz-graph'])` by default and if one asks, it could use the graphviz + dot2tex output instead. But, I was thinking of doing this in another ticket as a follow up, as this will open discussions that will just make longer before this ticket can go in.

Also, I want to say that I believe that the `sage.repl` code is broken with respect to showing svg files.

```
# Jupyter cell 1
g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
from sage.plot.tikzpicture import TikzPicture
t = TikzPicture(latex(g), usepackage=['tkz-graph'])
t # works: it shows a png
```

```
# Jupyter cell 2
from sage.repl.rich_output import get_display_manager
dm = get_display_manager()
assert dm.preferences.graphics is None
dm.preferences.graphics = 'raster'
t  # works: it shows a png
```


```
# Jupyter cell 3
dm.preferences.graphics = 'vector'
t   # broken: it does not show anything
```

The following shows that the Jupyter notebook is able to handle a svg correctly:

```
# Jupyter cell 4
t.svg('a.svg')
from IPython.core.display import SVG
SVG(filename='a.svg')
```

I suggest to fix the issue with the showing of svg in another ticket.

Replying to [comment:78 vdelecroix]:
> If `'m y p i c t u r e.pdf'` is an explicitely supported filename, it would make sense to mention it and test it. If it is an obscure feature, nevermind.

Well, `LatexExpr` already inherits from the Python class `str` which makes it full of methods that, as a user, I don't want to see in the list of methods seen with tab-completion on an object of type `TikzPicture`.

There are four such methods right now:

```
    def from_dot_string(cls, dotdata, prog='dot'):
    def from_graph(cls, graph, merge_multiedges=True,
    def from_graph_with_pos(cls, graph, scale=1, merge_multiedges=True,
    def from_poset(cls, poset, **kwds):
```

As you suggest, I can change those taking a graph or a poset sage object into a private method:

```
    def from_dot_string(cls, dotdata, prog='dot'):
    def _from_graph(cls, graph, merge_multiedges=True,
    def _from_graph_with_pos(cls, graph, scale=1, merge_multiedges=True,
    def _from_poset(cls, poset, **kwds):
```

But, there is no sage object for a dot string. So, do I keep `from_dot_string` as it is or do you want me to make it private as well?

It should be fine to keep `from_dot_string`.

It would be better not to advertize them in the module docstring

```diff
- If dot2tex Sage optional package and graphviz are installed, then the following
- one liner works allowing to create a nice tikzpicture from a graph with
- vertices and edges placed according to graphviz::
-
-    sage: t = TikzPicture._from_graph(g)  # optional: dot2tex # long time (3s)
-
```

And you can add a sentence explaining the transducer example that comes after.

This was suggested in comment:34 by mkoeppe, to which I agree. The goal of the module is about drawing stuff, so it is natural to put it in `sage/plot`.

It is not true that all latex code is in misc. You also have `graph_latex.py` file in `sage/graphs`.

Also, to my opinion, `sage/misc/latex.py` is not soooo well-written (I repeat, this is an opinion). It is a module on which it is tough to build on top / reuse. You may want to look at the code which implements `view` to get an example. Who really wants to use this?

It might be true that `sage.misc.latex` is a mess. But given that
1. `tikzpicture.py` shares some functionalities with `sage.misc.latex` (including code duplication)
2. `sage.misc.latex` is widely used
3. you claim that `StandaloneTex`/`TikzPicture` is part of the future of `sage.misc.latex`
I would like to
1. have an idea of what is the future of `sage.misc.latex` (you said that a *step forward* but there is no destination)
2. have the tools that will replace `sage.misc.latex` close to it in the sage source code or at the very least a mention of them in its documentation

What I want to avoid is that this ticket only adds a module `n+1` to sagemath which does a small variation of module `1`, module `2` and module `n` independently of all of them.

Only the line `t.pdf()` really needs the `latex_package_tkz_graph` optional tag. So I added this tag where necessary. Creating a Python string containing `'\usetikzlibrary{tkz-graph}'` by itself does not depend on the latex package. So, I did not added the optional tag everywhere.

Alternatively, use lambda functions instead of symbolic ones:

```diff
-            sage: f(x) = -1 / x
-            sage: g(x) = 1 / (x + 1)
+            sage: f = lambda x: -1 / x
+            sage: g = lambda x: 1 / (x + 1)
