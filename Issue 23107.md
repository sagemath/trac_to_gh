Doesn't this already work? This field `L` is an example from the docstring for `Qp.extension`.

```
sage: F = list(Qp(19)['x'](cyclotomic_polynomial(5)).factor())[0][0]
sage: L = Qp(19).extension(F, names='a')
sage: L
Unramified Extension of 19-adic Field with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(19^20))*x^2 + (5 + 2*19 + 10*19^2 + 14*19^3 + 7*19^4 + 13*19^5 + 5*19^6 + 12*19^7 + 8*19^8 + 4*19^9 + 14*19^10 + 6*19^11 + 5*19^12 + 13*19^13 + 16*19^14 + 4*19^15 + 17*19^16 + 8*19^18 + 4*19^19 + O(19^20))*x + (1 + O(19^20))
sage: u = L(4+19).sqrt(); u
2 + 5*19 + 3*19^2 + 11*19^3 + 12*19^4 + 13*19^5 + 11*19^6 + 15*19^7 + 12*19^8 + 18*19^9 + 15*19^10 + 2*19^11 + 9*19^12 + 4*19^13 + 19^15 + 19^16 + 13*19^18 + 3*19^19 + O(19^20)
sage: u^2
4 + 19 + O(19^20)
```

The syntax `sqrt(L(4+19))` also works.

If I am not mistaken, with the version of sage I am working with (8.0.rc0), the square root is working fine for elements of Qp (even if Qp is embeded in an extension) but not for elements of an extension of Qp (not in Q_p). Continuing your example :

```

Several comments:

- you don't need your function `_artin_schreier` since Sage has already methods (e.g. `roots`) for solving algebraic equations in finite fields

- in the `square_root` method, `prec` shouldn't be the precision cap of the parent but the actual precision of the element, no?

- in the `square_root` method, use the `sqrt` method for computing the square root modulo p (by the way, I don't understand why this part is needed)

- `ceil((prec+1)/2.0)` is also `1 + prec // 2`, isn't it?

- I would say that our recursive implementation is slower that an iterative one, but I'm not sure

- maybe, you could at the same time complete the documentation of the method `sqrt`

Yeah, I think that's correct.  It would be nice to have it also include an implementation for other primes, but that's not currently in the code.

My answer to the first comments of Xavier: \\
1) artin schreier is very efficient to solve equations of the form 
x2=ax+b by using a square and multiply type algorithm it shoud perform in ln(n)2 (where n is the degree of Q_q / Q_p) operations in Q_2. I don't know what is the algorithm implemented in roots but it should be less efficient, no ?\\

2) yes I will make the change \\
3) I have search through the square_root method and I could find only to lines with the keyword sqrt : 
* ans = self.parent()(self.__pari__().sqrt())
*  z = self._inv_sqrt(prec)
the first one is for calling the pari implementation and the second one is a call to the inverse square root method.\\
4) yes I will make the change\\
5) ok\\
6) Ok \\
7) I will extend the implementation for odd primes p.
Thanks for your comments and you help !
