Keywords: reflection group, gap3

The following doctest used to work:

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup((3,1,2))          # optional - gap3
sage: for w in W:                           # optional - gap3
....:     w.reduced_word()                  # optional - gap3
....:     [w.to_matrix(), w.to_matrix(on_space="dual")] # optional - gap3
```

and now breaks in

```
'SageMath version 7.4, Release Date: 2016-10-18'
```

This was caused by an overly generous removal of `keys()` from families. I've added them back in (and cc-ing Frédéric so we are more careful about this in the future).
