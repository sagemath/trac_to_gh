Just a confirmation that with the three tickets applied all tests pass (debian 64bits).

Could you replace

```
if np.array_equal(vert1, tpath.vertices) and np.array_equal(code1, tpath.codes):
     return True
else:
     return False
```

with

```

Looking around distros that provide `arm` support I am wondering how it was building on arm before. I think none of fedora, debian or gentoo have trouble with arm but they all pass `config_fc --noarch` to `setup.py` which was done at some point in sage but has been removed a while ago.

I think I might have removed the `no_arch` stuff when I began to clean up the spkg mess.
Backporting the fix looks a good idea for a further ticket.
Or we just wait for a numpy version bump.

The danger with those two scenario is that the removal will be forgotten. However considering that everyone else has it with some variations (Gentoo has `noopt` and fedora has `fcompiler=gunf95` [or something]) I guess it doesn't hurt to keep it.
