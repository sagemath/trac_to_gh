NO branch is associated with this. How do I push my changes from the local branch?.

* push your local branch to git.sagemath.org or trac.sagemath.org
* fill the branch name in the ticket description here

your branch name should probably use your login name "gh-JhaPrajjwal"


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-03-04 12:25:06

did you manage to push a branch ?


---

Comment by @JhaPrajjwal created at 2019-03-04 19:11:10

I need a trac account. I had requested for it about 2 days ago.

No, you do not need an account, I do not think so.

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#obtaining-an-account

If you know how to use "git" (and not our optional custom plugin called "git trac"), then you can just push with your github login.

Something like

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-JhaPrajjwal/mybranchname
```

should just work.

In that case ,I recieve this error:

git`@`trac.sagemath.org: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

you need to set up your public key inside trac, as explained below in the same page:

Good. Now there is a branch to look at.

But your branch contains a bad file: octave-workspace


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-03-04 20:36:20

a suggestion (for your next ticket): give your branches some name that either contains the ticket number or describes what the branch does

Well, make a branch where this file is not added, and push it here...

still the same problem. You can click on the `Branch:` field in the ticket description to see the bad file that you are adding.

I suggest "git rm octave-workspace", then "commit", then "rebase -i develop" to squash the commits, then "push -f"


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-03-05 15:05:02

Are you `Justine Falque` or `Jha Prajjwal` ? Please fix the `Author fullname:` field in the ticket description, if necessary.

At #18855 you put "Prajjwal Jha" as author name,
and here you put "Jha Prajjwal". Would you mind
changing one or the other to make it consistent?
