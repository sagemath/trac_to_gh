No, you do not need an account, I do not think so.

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#obtaining-an-account

If you know how to use "git" (and not our optional custom plugin called "git trac"), then you can just push with your github login.

Something like

```
git push trac HEAD:u/gh-JhaPrajjwal/mybranchname
```

should just work.
