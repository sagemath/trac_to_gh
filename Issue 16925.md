# Issue 16925: Error in semi-symmetric graph documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17162

The documentation for [semi-symmetric graphs](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html#sage.graphs.graph.Graph.is_semi_symmetric) claims that the [Gray graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_graph) is the smallest such graph, but the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-symmetric_graph) referenced in the documentation does not concur.  (It apparently is the smallest _cubic_ such graph.)  Either way, there needs to be a fix - on Wikipedia or, more likely, in our documentation.  (Note that the Folkman graphs is also in Sage.)

Ahaha. If you write it I will review it `:-)`

P.S.: it's a one-line doc patch ! `:-P`

Nice offer, but I would rather _review_ a one-line doc patch in an area I am not an expert in.  I suppose one could add _both_ pieces of information to this doc...

Come on... I do exactly what you would do, i.e. read Wikipedia and fix the doc `:-P`

I am not exactly an expert on this topic `^^;`

That's more Dima's thing I would say.

Huh?  But you're the graph theorist, not me... 

Anyway, this looks fine - I bet they were ordering regular graphs first by degree, _then_ by order, maybe.
