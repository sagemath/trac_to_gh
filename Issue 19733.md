Keywords: OpenMath

To provide an OpenMath interface or "phrasebook", we need

- abstract classes for OpenMath objects that can be serialized
  into and importet from OpenMath XML format,
  possibly even OpenMath binary format.

  Both are described at http://openmath.org/standard/

- accessors to the abstract classes.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19970
