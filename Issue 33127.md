There still remains a lot of `# py2` tags in explain_pickle, see #33144

I don't think this needs both `# random` and `...`, otherwise LGTM:


```diff
             sage: N = M.minor('defgh', 'abc')
-            sage: N # py2
+            sage: N  # random
             M / {'d', 'e', 'f', 'g'} \ {'a', 'b', 'c', 'h'}, where M is Vamos:
             Matroid of rank 4 on 8 elements with circuit-closures
-            {3: {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}, {'a', 'b', 'e', 'f'},
-                 {'a', 'b', 'g', 'h'}, {'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'},
-                 {'e', 'f', 'g', 'h'}},
-             4: {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h'}}}
+            ...
```

well, random is necessary for the first line of the doctest, I think (but maybe not). The dots cut out some non-essential part of the output, which contain no information. But sure, I could put that part back.

I'm not picky about it, but my view of the `# random` tag is that it allows you to show the user non-deterministic examples with the understanding that "you'll see something that looks like this, but maybe not exactly this."

It's hard to maintain (nothing fails if the output changes), but I don't have a better idea for the `EXAMPLES` block.

ok, here is the doctest without dots, only random tagged
