The class `UniqueFactory` (see `src/sage/structure/factory.pyx`) has a strange way of implementing `__reduce__`:

```
            obj._factory_data = self, version, key, extra_args
            if obj.__class__.__reduce__.__objclass__ is object:
                # replace the generic object __reduce__ to use this one
                obj.__reduce_ex__ = types.MethodType(generic_factory_reduce, obj)
```

It dynamically sets the `__reduce_ex__` attribute on the *instance* to implement pickling. It is not clear to me why this needs to be so special: couldn't we do this with a normal `__reduce__` method on `UniqueFactory`?

I am bringing this up because this breaks with Cython 0.26.
