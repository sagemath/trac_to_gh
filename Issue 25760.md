Oddly enough, it turns out that `get_matrix_class` doesn't even get as far as testing whether the base ring is a finite field.

Gosh, the bug is in the test for an integer mod ring:

```
sage: sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.is_IntegerModRing(GF(3))
True
```


So, apparently its implementation has changed. I am not gonna argue about `is_IntegerModRing`, because mathematically `GF(3)` IS an integer mod ring. but then to the very least `get_matrix_class` should first test for finite fields and only later for integer mod rings.

A finite prime field is at the same time an integer mod ring. So, if the implementation "meataxe" is requested for a matrix over a finite prime field, this case should be dealt with in the "if" clause testing for an integer mod ring. With that fix, at least the tests in src/sage/matrix pass. So, I'll push the branch in a minute...

I guess the logic should be:
1. Is a specific implementation requested? If this is the case, test whether this specific implementation supports the given base ring.
2. Otherwise, choose a default implementation according to whether R is finite, a field, a quotient ring, etc.

Currently, these two tasks are intertwined. First, some properties of the ring are checked and only then it is considered whether an implementation is requested.

Why am I getting errors when checking out the ticket branch?

```
