See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-support/gPCIAtImrVo/lcxh_HyiEQAJ):

```
sage: type(unit_step(x).operator()) 
<class 'sage.functions.generalized.FunctionUnitStep'> 
sage: type(unit_step(x)._sympy_()._sage_().operator()) 
<class 'sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction'> 
```


This may also fix the observed problem in that thread, if not we will need another ticket for that.
