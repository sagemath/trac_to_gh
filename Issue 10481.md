Assignee: @videlec

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: generation, combinatorics, set, subset, partition

This ticket stands for a faster implementation of subset and partition generation of (finite or infinite) enumerated sets.

The timing for anything related to Sage sage.combinat.Subwords, sage.combinat.Subsets, sage.combinat.SetPartitions, ... are very slow. The roadmap is as follows

1) **Low level generation:** Implement a small python extension which must be as performant as itertools is


```
sage: import itertools
sage: list(itertools.combinations(['a','b','c'],2))
[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')]
```


The following will be available:

* subset of given size
* all subsets
* set partitions with given integer combination
* all set partitions

And for each of them different order of generation (lex, revlex, Gray codes, ...) and output as list or tuple.

Any Suggested names for iterators?

combinations_lex_as_list, combinations_lex_as_tuple combinations_revlex_as_

2) **Include and interface it with Sage:** this won't be hard.

Hi Vincent,

Your patch looks good except a few remarks:

- the field Author below is for credits. You should put your real name and
  not your login.

- the documentation now says:
   {{{
   [...]
   The elements of the output are tuples of Python int (and not Sage Integer).
   [...]
   It's element are returned as plain list of python int.
   }}}
   At least one of those two sentences is wrong. Also they seems a little
   redundent. This should be fixed.

I'm sorry for not having the time to put a review patch, nor finish the review
now.

Hi Vincent,

I need more time to review your long patch. I just notice the following:

```
file: sage/combinat/choose_nk.py
85	            sage: [0,2] in c52   # trac XXXX 
```

You probably want to replace XXXX by an actual number. I'll continue my review tomorrow (hopefully)

Hi Florent

> I need more time to review your long patch. 

Certainly. Thanks for the review.

I have three important design questions relative to that patch and the Combinatorial classes which it modify
* should the attributes of a CombinatorialClass be visible like S.w or do we prefer S._w (some code in graphs uses a direct call to S.w) ?
* what should be the inheritance/relations between say Subsets (subset of a given set) and Subsets_k (subset of size k of a given set) ?
* what should be the output of Subwords ? tuple, list, strings, any user defined type ? Actually, if you initialize it with list (resp. tuple, string) it output lists (resp. tuple, string).

This is because the methods _element_constructor_(self, x) are not directly tested. There should be a comment "# indirect doctest" after the corresponding test. Basically, this function is used to build an element of a parent, but it is called through the method __call__ of the parent (which is implemented in Parent).

> Also, "devel/sage/sage/tests/interrupt.pyx" timed out when I ran the long doctests.

This is much more ennoying and I do not know why.

Helloooooooooooooooo !!!

While I read your patch, two things :
* an "It's" should become an "its"
* why do you change the ouput type from lists to tuples ?

Btw, sorry I did not answer your comment many months ago, I may have missed the warning from trac : I had set the ticket to `needs_info` because you seemed to be asking rather fundamental questions which would have had an impact on the patch, so that it would have been a pity to review the patch if you intended to change it so much later.

Have you had an answer from Florent since ?

I have made a branch from the latest patch, but only partially. I have not touched the files `set_partition` and `set_partition_ordered`.

Ok. From the commit you proposed, I think we could
- deprecate `ChooseNK` and `SplitNK` as it is used nowhere and subsumed by subsets and set partitions.
- do some more cleaning in `combination.py`, `subset.py` and `subwords.py`:
    - remove the inheritance from `CombinatorialClass` and make them inherit from `Parent`. We would set the category to `EnumeratedSets().Finite()`
    - better iteration
    - make `Subwords` work with words as input
      {{{
      sage: Subwords(Word([1,2,3,4,5]))
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      ValueError: datatype should be str, list or tuple
      }}}
    - etc
If you agree with this, I can modify the ticket description and propose a commit.
