Keywords: poset

I suggest adding a function that decomposes a poset "vertically", i.e. has same relationship to `ordinal_sum()` as `connected_components()` has to `disjoint_union()`.

I am not sure about the name. Work name is `ordinal_decomposition`. Maybe it could be `ordinal_components` or `vertical_components`.

Here is the code to add to `hasse_diagram.py`. I suppose not to have time to make this a patch file for few days. Feel free to comment.

```
def ordinal_decomposition(self):
    r"""
    Return the ordinal decomposition of the poset.
    
    This function is kind of inverse to ordinal_sum(). Ordinal
    decomposition of a poset `P` is the list of posets
    `P_1, \ldots, P_n` so that `P` is ordinal decomposition of them.

    OUTPUT:
        
    List of numbers `e_1, \ldots, e_n`
    so that `P_1` is subposet containing `0, \ldots, e_1`,
    `P_2` is subposet containing `e_1+1, \ldots, e_2` and so on.
   
    ALGORITHM::
        
        Suppose that poset `P` is the ordinal sum of posets `L` and
        `U`. Then `P` contains maximal antichains `l` and `u` such that
        every element of `u` covers exactly every element of `l` and
        every element of `l` is covered by exactly every element of `u`; they
        correspond to maximal elements of `L` and minimal elements
        of `U`.

        We know that the Hasse diagram is a topologically sorted DAG,
        starting numbering from zero. Hence, if `L` has `n` elements, 
        then `l` contains element `n-1` and `u` contains element
        `n`.

        We keep track of the maximal elements of subposet induced
        by elements 0..e and minimal elements of subposet induced
        by elements e+1..n, incrementing e one by one. Then we just
        check if they can be `l` and `u` in previous description.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.combinat.posets.hasse_diagram import HasseDiagram
        sage: H = HasseDiagram({0:[2], 1:[2, 3], 2:[4, 5, 6], 3:[4, 5, 6],
        ....: 4:[7], 5:[7], 6:[7], 7:[8]})
        sage: H.ordinal_decomposition()
        [3, 6, 7, 8]

    TESTS::
        
        sage: from sage.misc.prandom import randint
        sage: n = randint(1, 10)
        sage: P = Posets.RandomPoset(n, 0.1)
        sage: H = P.ordinal_sum(P)._hasse_diagram
        sage: m = H.ordinal_decomposition()
        sage: n in m
        True
    """
    cut_points = []
    n = self.order()
    in_degrees = [len(self.neighbors_in(e)) for e in range(n)]
    lower = set([])
    upper = set(self.sources())

    for e in range(n):
        lower.add(e)
        for lc in self.neighbors_in(e):
            lower.discard(lc)
        upper.discard(e)
        up_covers = self.neighbors_out(e)
        for uc in up_covers:
            in_degrees[uc] -= 1
            if in_degrees[uc] == 0:
                upper.add(uc)
        if e+1 in up_covers:
            for l in lower:
                if set(self.neighbors_out(l)) != upper:
                    break
            else:

Other possibility would be `posets.py`. But then recursive `ordinal_decomposition`-`connected_components` would unnecessarily create intermediate posets instead of `HasseDiagram`s. It is slower.

And series-parallel decomposition is nothing more than just trying "ordinal and parallel decomposition" until there is nothing that can be done.

Why do you insist on having it return a Hasse Diagram? If you want the decomposition feature without having to build posets, then you could have a 'as_posets=True` optional argument in the Poset method, which would either return a list of posets or return a partition of the elements.

I don't believe that a designs that requires you to implement two functions every time you need one is a good thing.. Additionally, the docstring of the HasseDiagram function that currently appears in this branch starts with `Return the ordinal decomposition of the poset`. This method screams that it does not belong there.

You do not need to build posets even though you are a Poset method. Because you can access `_hasse_diagram` directly, and because there is no constraint whastoever on the type of what you should return. You can have optional arguments to return the result as whatever you want: posets, digraphs, partitions...

And if the Poset constructor was even remotely sensible you would have no reason to *fear* the time loss in the poset constructor.

Additionally, the docstring of the HasseDiagram function that currently appears in this branch starts with `Return the ordinal decomposition of the poset`. This method screams that it does not belong there.


Hasse diagram is a poset with some constraints... I can change that docstring.

But the question remains: What is the meaning of `hasse_diagram.py`? Whole poset class could be implemented with just a digraph as one member variable. But then I guess we would have more internal functions starting with `_`. Or more functions returning something actually only useful for internal use.

An example: check (broken!) parameter `partial` at `maximal_chains`. It is needed for `order_complex`. I think that the whole concept of "partial maximal chain" is odd and should be removed. It could have placed in `hasse_diagrams.py`, which is meant for internal implementation. (Btw, see #18944 - my suggestion to drop `partial`-option was rejected.)

I think that I can generate something like all posets of size 7 in the same time as all Hasse diagrams of size 8. So it really loses some cpu time to make posets.

If I do

then `len(upper)` will be called many times.

And it was not a problem at all with how it was used before you added the 'degree check'. Nesting two looks a bit unpleasant to me, which is why I suggested this 'all( ... )' thing but I can understand that it only matters to me.

I think that "visible" poset functions, i.e. those not starting with `_`, should give meaningful set of operations to do with posets. It does not always directly correspond with good structure for internal functions. So should I add a `_`-function to `posets.py` or add a strange option for `ordinal_decomposition` to be used just for series-parallel decomposition? Both options sounds strange, as the already have "internal" class.

I know. It's hard to get a `positive_review` from you, but easy to get performance tips etc. in the process. `:=)`

a decomposition.

Another possibility would be 'ordinal_sum_decomposition'.

'ordinal_components' is ambiguous because there exists also 'ordinal product' (not yet in sage maybe), besides ordinal sum.

Some thoughts, not a clear opinion yet:

We do have `ordinal_product` already. An "inverse function" of if would be `ordinal_factors`, I think. Compare to "factoring (undirected) graphs" (done be Nathann IIRC).

`certificate=True` sounds natural to for example `dimension`: there is not **the** set of realizers, just bunch of minimal sets and one of them is returned. For this function we do have exact "components", "parts" or something like that.

There is now `is_connected` and `conneced_components`. It would be orthogonal design to have two functions for this one also.

Hello,

> This should really be discussed on sage-devel. Someone has originally implemented this, and I guess he/she have had a reason for this.


True, but it would be a mistake to value a reason that we do not know more than those we figured out ourselves. Maybe something smart may come from sage-devel indeed, though. I hope that we will hear something different from the frequent refusal to change things 'on principle'.

> If I am right, now we just needs to decide the name.


Yep. I concur with Frédéric's proposal of a `is_ordinal_sum` with an optional certificate. The same is done differently for `is_connected/connected_components`, but there at least there is no doubt on which terminology should be used. Perhaps it's worth asking on sage-devel too if you prefer.

'certificate' is a generic term that is used in some places already (mostly because of me I expect), but it is not a 'standard' at all. Is there another term you would prefer?

Depends on what *you* plan to use it for. `.is_ordinal_sum(as_posets=True)` or `.is_ordinal_sum(as_partition=True)` would work for me, and either return an empty list (when it is not) or return a list of whatever is requested.

What do you want us to compare in the naming of this function and the content of #19123?

It could be a building block for series-parallel decomposition.
