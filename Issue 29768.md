This branch fixes a few small problems I noticed while working on #29942.

* Make a parameter name in an exception message match the formal parameter.
* Update references to refer to the book version of D. Knuth's _The Art of Computer Programming_ Volume 4A, rather than the pre-release fascicles.
* Fix spelling in some comments.
