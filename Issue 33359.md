It is a very cool feature!

The `plot` method should include such an example which is decorated with `# optional - sage.plot` where the `explosion_factor` is nonzero.

Probably not so great that the exploded plot uses rainbow colors implicitly but the non-exploded plot doesn't

Can use rainbow color plot when `explosion_factor=0` is provided, and use normal plot when `explosion_factor` is not specified.

Here's a better version.

3d plot is broken here using conda+chrome.

Does the new feature work on an unbounded polyhedral complex?
Might be a bug example:

```
sage: pc5 = PolyhedralComplex([Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,-1]]),Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0], [0,-1,0], [0,0,-1]]),
                         Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0], [0,-1,0], [0,0,1]]),Polyhedron(rays=[[-1,0,0], [0,-1,0], [0,0,-1]]),
                         Polyhedron(rays=[[-1,0,0], [0,-1,0], [0,0,1]]),Polyhedron(rays=[[-1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,-1]]),
                         Polyhedron(rays=[[-1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1]])])
sage: pc5.plot(explosion_factor=1, color='rainbow', alpha=0.5, axes=False)
```

I use `center` for the shifting. Not sure what this would do in the unbounded case

Try now. `explosion_factor=0.3` is better in this case

Add examples of 3d plots.

Since points are plotted before polyhedra, will they be covered by the polyhedra? Shall we either use zorder or reverse the plotting order to make vertices visible?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-08-07 06:34:58

good idea to plot them in the reverse order

Thanks for adding these great examples and for the review
