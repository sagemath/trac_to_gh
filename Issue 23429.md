# Issue 23429: Unlinkable documentation files

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-08-21 15:48:08

There are two files that refer to documents up the tree without any problem:
 * `src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Multivariable-Calculus.rst` links `<../Calculus>`
 * `src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.rst` links to `<../Programming>`

but it was not possible for me to compile a link to `<../polynomial_rings/index>` included in the file `src/doc/en/reference/calculus/index.rst` nor a similar link upwards.

Condition: it must be compiled with `make` after `make doc-clean`

What works is creating an RST link, i.e. a file in the current directory containing `.. include:: ../file`. This does not explain why referring to `../file` directly works in `en/prep`.
