This is about load/attach spyx file, or doing cython('...').    
The autogenerated code is:
1. very hard to find.  Probably by default running load/attach/cython should display info about the location of the compiled file by default the first time the file is compiled.  Make it easier to silence (say via some sort of cython.verbose function, whose existence is printed as part of the verbose message). 

2. The generated C code should be annoted with original source lines

3. There's no way to get the html markup of the annoted code like in the notebook.  This should be generated by default.
