I created the class `AbstractCode` and moved all the relevant methods from `AbstractLinearCode`.

Originally, I had `default_encoder` and `default_decoder` parameters in the initialisation of `AbstractCode`, however, I ran into an issue with dependencies - if I set a `default_encoder` for `AbstractLinearCode`, this would then be the default for all the codes inheriting from this. I am sure that this can be fixed, however maybe it makes sense for classes such as `AbstractLinearCode` to not have default decoders/encoders?

Finally, one of the doc tests fails. I tried to set up the category stuff (`Parent.__init__()`), but I don't think I did it correctly. 

This is just a rough, first draft.

Thanks for working on this! I took a quick view over the new class, and it looks good. There are some copy/paste errors in the documentation where it refers to `AbstractLinearCode` or "this linear code" etc., but that's small stuff.

More importantly, I am worried about how `AbstractCode` should fit into the category framework. In particular, a non-linear code is not necessarily a module. Also, some objects people call codes are not even inside some free module like `R^n` for some ring `R`, e.g. polyalphabetic codes like Chinese Remainder Codes or Polynomial Remainder codes, which are inside `A_1 x A_2 x ... x A_n` for some rings `A_i`.

The task of `AbstractCode` would then basically only consist of setting up the encoder/decoder framework, as well as providing the `metric` method, which I like (I guess `list()` is fine too). It shouldn't even have a length I guess?

In this case, I don't know whether `AbstractCode` should somehow otherwise be made a parent in the category framework, or whether we should agree that this is a "contract" that sub-classes have to do themselves.

I made all the changes we discussed, namely:

The category framework is no longer set up in `AbstractCode`. Instead of inheriting from `Module`, it now inherits from `Parent`. I tried a few things, e.g. `SageObject`, `Set` here and `Parent` seemed to do the trick. I added some documentation hopefully instructing the user on how to set the category framework up.

I took `base_field` away from the initiating parameters of `AbstractCode`. This should be the only change in `AbstractLinearCode`.

The `decoder` and `encoder` methods now instruct the user to add a decoder/encoder for the code if they try to use the encoder/decoder framework without having set these up. I added tests for these. If there are no default encoders/decoders, the methods `decoders_available` and `encoders_available` return an empty list. Let me know if all the checks for `None` are correctly set up.

I extended the documentation and following the example of `AbstractLinearCode`, added an example of how to use `AbstractCode` to create a subclass.

A lot of the documentation overlaps with `AbstractLinearCode`, however I don't think this is an issue.

This looks very promising! My comments may look long but they are not too heavy. Note: this is not a complete review, I didn't compile, run the code and build the documentation. I'm hoping Dima will do that :-)

- Top of the class:
    The only assumption we kept is that the code is enumerable.
  change to
    The abstract notion of "code" that is implicitly used for this class is any
    enumerable subset of a cartesian product `A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots
    \times A_n` for some sets `A_i`. Note though that this class makes no
    attempt to directly represent the code in this fashion, allowing subclasses
    to make the appropriate choices. The notion of metric is also not
    mathematically enforced in any way, and is simply stored as a string value.
    ".

  The line just after has a line break very early, doesn't it?

- `part of the framework category` -> `part of the category framework`

- `any method that works on linear codes works for our` -> `coming from AbstractCode code`

- The example in `AbstractCode.__init__` is not great, since it doesn't yield a
  working code class (it doesn't implement `_list_` etc.). Can you make an
  small, but more meaningful example, e.g. the code consisting of the l words

  {{{
  {
    00...00,
    10...00,
    11...00,
    ...
    11...10,
    11...11
  }
  }}}

  For this code, you could add a full working example with implementations of
  `_list_`, `__iter__`, `__contains__`.

  The For #28209, the example could be expounded upon in a short thematic
  tutorial: adding an encoder/unencoder from the ring (ZZ mod (l+1)) into the
  code. The metric could be Hamming (though the code is of course quite bad),
  and that would allow attaching the LinearCodeNearestNeighbor decoder, which
  actually works for any code under the Hamming metric.

  That would be very nice documentation for anyone wanting to implement a new
  class of codes not fitting in linear/hamming codes.

- The example for `_repr_` and `_latex_` is unnecessarily complicated because
  `AbstractCode` does not need supplying encoders and decoders. Use instead the
  smaller example from e.g. `__contains__`.

- In doc for `decode_to_code` and `decode_to_message`, the description of
  `word` should say "an element in the ambient space as `self`". The code might
  not be vectorial in the classical sense.

- For `decoder()` and `encoder()`, the exception thrown should be a
  `NotImplementedError` and the message could perhaps be "No encoder [resp. decoder]
  implemented for this code".

- In doc for `encode`, then the description of `word` should say "an element
  of a message space of the code". The message space might not be vectorial. The
  note after the INPUT block is not appropriate anymore and should just be
  removed.

- At this abstraction there's virtually no service we could put on an Encoder or
  Decoder class which would justify having an AbstractEncoder or
  AbstractDecoder, I think. In a strongly typed OOP language, like Java, we
  would of course have to have such a thing, but I believe in Python and
  [SageMath](SageMath) in particular, the convention is not to have needless abstract
  classes. Therefore your oneline doc changes to `encoder.py` and
  `decoder.py` are spot-on: that's all the change we'll have for those files.

  However, we are left with something of a documentation problem. For where do
  we document the precise interface requirements of an encoder and a decoder
  assumed by the framework in AbstractCode? I think the best place for this is a
  (not too long) discussion at the top of the file `abstract_code.py`, i.e.
  just after "Any class inheriting ... can use the encode/decode framework".
  Here we can describe what that is, and what is meant and promised by an
  encoder/decoder.

  I am OK with having a relatively short description of the purpose, and just
  mentioning the methods an encoder must have (`encode`, `__call__` which is
  simply `encode`, `unencode`, `message_space` and `code`), and similarly for
  a decoder. And then pointing to `Encoder` and `Decoder` as examples.

Best,
Johan

Putting it in the category framework would be great, but I think it is fine as it is. I'm happy with the example :-)

None of those methods seem to do anything useful, and they don't even make much sense for a (linear) code to begin with. `endomorphism_ring` is particularly unfortunate, since we have `automorphism_group_gens` which does something very useful, and a user might confuse these.

We are standing with a single \"module with basis\", so we should put that into the category. But there is no class `ModuleWithBasis` (singular). So the way this is done is to inherit from `Module` and then use a magic incantation to tell the category framework that this is not just any module, it is a module with basis. That's exactly what is currently done in `AbstractLinearCode`.\n\nLooking at the definition of `sage.modules.modules.Module`, I don't see anything useful for `LinearCode`s to inherit. On the other hand, it's probably not a good idea to put a parent object into the category of modules (with basis) without that parent object actually being a module. At least, any strong type system would cry ;-)\n\nSo I suggest just keeping the status quo by using multiple inheritance so `AbstractLinearCode`  inherits from both `AbstractCode` and `Module` (in that order).",

I see, this is due to the structure of the category framework: `ModulesWithBasis` is a category (i.e. the set of all modules with a basis). We are standing with a single "module with basis", so we should put that into the category. But there is no class `ModuleWithBasis` (singular). So the way this is done is to inherit from `Module` and then use a magic incantation to tell the category framework that this is not just any module, it is a module with basis. That's exactly what is currently done in `AbstractLinearCode`.

Looking at the definition of `sage.modules.modules.Module`, I don't see anything useful for `LinearCode`s to inherit. On the other hand, it's probably not a good idea to put a parent object into the category of modules (with basis) without that parent object actually being a module. At least, any strong type system would cry ;-)

So I suggest just keeping the status quo by using multiple inheritance so `AbstractLinearCode`  inherits from both `AbstractCode` and `Module` (in that order).
