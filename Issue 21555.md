Use spaces, not a mixture of spaces and TABs.

This is a totally trivial ticket. To avoid merge conflicts, a quick review would come in handy.

Have you used a script to do this? If so, can we have a look at it?

It was a very trivial `sed` script, replacing every TAB by 8 spaces and deleting all trailing spaces. I had to undo a few cases where the TABs were in Makefiles or where the TABs were not leading space.

Perhaps the whitespace policy should be documented in our developer manual.

And we should have a `.dir-locals.el` and its equivalent (if any) for vim users.

On my OS X machine, the change to `ecm/spkg-install` leads to

```
./spkg-install: line 293: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```

Undo the change and it works fine. (The `-` in `cat >foo.c <<-"EOF"` means to strip leading tabs, and `<<` is looking for just `"EOF"` all by itself, so the line `EOF` needs to be indented strictly by tabs or not at all.)

I think it's confusing to require TABs, so I used an ordinary here document with `<<`.
