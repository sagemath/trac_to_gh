Branch on this ticket does NOT work because pip/setuptools do not handle the symlink well.

Perhaps it's easier to get rid of sage-env-config altogether (#29852).

Using flit instead of setuptools (#29854) does not help for this ticket because flit does not know how to install prepared shell scripts -- it can only install Python scripts

It would probably suffice to just replace the use of `pip` by `setup.py install`.

Changing status from positive_review to needs_info.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-11-11 20:22:28

I set it to "needs info" because this design potentially conflicts with #30896 (./configure --without-python); see also #29852	(Get rid of sage-env-config).
