here are all the instances of wrapper_cdf.h I have:

```
$ find . -name wrapper_cdf.h
./local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.h
./build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.7/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.h
./build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/cythonized/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.h
```
