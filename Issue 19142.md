The [developer guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content) recommends to use uppercase `.. WARNING::`/`.. NOTE::` etc. Would be good to do it at the same time.

- "Print representation string" should be "Return representation string."
- Odd to have "``subscript``: subscript of the component", why not "``subscript`` -- subscript of the component" as usual?

Otherwise I did not found errors. Feel free to mark this to positive_review with or without my suggestions.
