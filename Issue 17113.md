Why do we test a lower bound for the fourth and fifth singular value? Predictably breaks on some platforms.  

```
            sage: A = matrix(CDF, [[46*I - 28, -47*I - 50, 21*I + 51, -62*I - 782, 13*I + 22],
            ....:                  [35*I - 20, -32*I - 46, 18*I + 43, -57*I - 670, 7*I + 3],
            ....:                  [22*I - 13, -23*I - 23, 9*I + 24, -26*I - 347, 7*I + 13],
            ....:                  [-44*I + 23, 41*I + 57, -19*I - 54, 60*I + 757, -11*I - 9],
