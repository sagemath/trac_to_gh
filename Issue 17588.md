# Issue 17588: wrong/weird conversion from SR to InfinityRing

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17825

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-02-22 10:16:47

We have

```
sage: InfinityRing(x)
A negative finite number
sage: InfinityRing(SR.var('q'))
A negative finite number
```

which looks weird.

Do you plan to review this ticket if I fix the conflict?

Yes. I have asked others this question in the past. Perhaps some people use the code but don't want to review it...

The sardonis patchbot has one relevant doctest fail. It appears that to determine `RIF(-1,1) < oo` it has to be coerced to the infinity ring but it has no sign. OTOH, `RIF(-1,1) < oo` is perfectly easily solvable so should not give an error.

Replying to [comment:9 rws]:

That doesn't really matter. The coercion model always coerces. And it is the coercion which fails in this case. That is not easy to fix.
