We have

```
sage: InfinityRing(x)
A negative finite number
sage: InfinityRing(SR.var('q'))
A negative finite number
```

which looks weird.

The sardonis patchbot has one relevant doctest fail. It appears that to determine `RIF(-1,1) < oo` it has to be coerced to the infinity ring but it has no sign. OTOH, `RIF(-1,1) < oo` is perfectly easily solvable so should not give an error.

Replying to [comment:9 rws]:
> OTOH, `RIF(-1,1) < oo` is perfectly easily solvable so should not give an error.

That doesn't really matter. The coercion model always coerces. And it is the coercion which fails in this case. That is not easy to fix.
