Not required, as John said.

>  * we haven't made it an optional package first

Not really a big deal I think

>  * we're adding another dependency of sage

No we're not - we're including another package in Sage.

By the way, I asked the author of speaklater on IRC to release a new version containing the fix for the pickling problem we ran across in sagenb many months ago, and a couple of days ago he seems to have released 1.3, so here's a new SPKG: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/speaklater-1.3.spkg

There was a typo in Mike's version of `speaklater.py` (`__eq__` was broken); os.path.join now works without the explicit string cast.

`os.path.exists` doesn't though (and I'm not sure exactly why, since I can't find the source code of `os.stat`).
