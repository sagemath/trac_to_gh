All tests pass!

I removed the text "Integer which is the conductor of the field." following INPUT, as it did not belong there.

bad syntax for the raise statement, not compatible with python 3

And there was no reviewer name...

I ran all tests, made a few style changes and changed `[1,4,9,25,49,121]` to more general code.  If you're happy with the changes, feel free to set this to positive review.
