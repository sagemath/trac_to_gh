Potential cause: dynamic modules are not yet well supported in libgap, right?
It seems Arch is packaging it nevertheless, and it gets automatically loaded in this case.

See #27218

That is correct.  This is fixed by #26930, so I would propose closing this as a duplicate, do you agree?

The fact is that without this fix, if some GAP packages are being loaded by default that in turn cause a shared module to be loaded it will fail.

I had noticed that basic building in sage-on-gentoo meant that `io.so` had missing symbols but I thought they would provided by the executable loading it (that's totally allowed). For my arch colleagues, just `LIBS=-lgap` to the configure invocation and the problem is fixed.

I would tend to wait for the fix to have percolated down to arch-linux to make sure everything is fine there (despite potential specific build idiosyncrasies). But otherwise, yes!

Thanks for your answer and all the quick progress.

```

This line in gap.py corresponds to the error code 13: GAP is trying to send a Window command, which points to the xgap package. 
I added some debug to figure out why the xgap package was being loaded and, to my surprise, I found out that Sage is trying to load *every* single GAP package installed on the system. Is that really intentional?

Answering to myself: yes, this seems to be intentional

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/interfaces/gap.py#L1581

So xgap should definitely be blacklisted here.

Actually, the problem is not that it tries to load xgap: that seems to be dealt with in SAGE_EXTCODE/gap/sage.g. The problem is with packages that have xgap in SuggestedPackages, namely sonata and cryst: apparently the sage.g blacklist doesn't work in that case and they still try to load xgap.

I've worked around this downstream by removing xgap from SuggestedPackages in sonata and cryst for now, but this should be fixed in sage itself so that it doesn't try to load xgap under any circumstances.

I'm not sure if that *can* be fixed in Sage without some mechanism from upstream to make it easier to completely prevent a package from being loaded.

Also, the problem with xgap only impacts the pexpect interface to GAP.  There are some tickets elsewhere about reducing, and ultimately eliminating dependence on that in the core Sage library.
