Replying to [comment:6 chapoton]:
> bot is morally green

Unfortunately, that doesn't mean much as many of those files deal with optional packages.

It's fine for the FriCAS interface.  The missing import 'LOCAL_IDENTIFIER' (about which I don't know much) is fixed in #25602, but it might actually be cleaner to fix it here.

+1 as long as the tests for the optional interfaces are run manually somewhere.

maybe there is a patchbot testing most of the optional interfaces ?

The arando patchbot runs all optional tests for optional packages which are shipped with Sage.
