I think it's not a bad idea to look at previous tickets dealing with an spkg when updating it.

In this case #10361 (updating setuptools to 0.6c11), which got positively reviewed and merged, but later unmerged again due to an issue with `twisted` on MacOS X.

The changes made there, namely
* making `spkg-install` executable,
* adding a *Special Update / Build Instructions* section to `SPKG.txt` (with a note on deleting the Windows binaries),
* removing mabs from the spkg maintainer list (I'm not sure if that's still desired),
* substituting `#!/bin/sh` by `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and, last but not least
* adding error checks to `spkg-install` (though now in addition patches are applied from it)
are all missing in the new spkg here.

Btw, the patch [attachment:setuptools-update.patch] (for review purposes) doesn't really reflect the changes made to (Sage's part of) the spkg, which is perhaps minor here, but still a bit confusing.

Yes, especially if you're searching for things like R... 8-)

which definitely belongs to an earlier version of the spkg. (Note the `url` in the context.)

If someone is lazy (like me), he might review (more or less) just the spkg diff on trac as is, assuming it reflects the current state of the spkg, such that mistakes or unintended changes made later may sneak in.

P.S.: I usually cc the spkg maintainers (as listed in `SPKG.txt`, and also on a completely outdated wiki page ;-) ), though apparently these entries have lost meaning, unfortunately.

P.P.S.: You can also search (with G**gle) http://groups.google.com/group/sage-trac, which even gives suitable results for "R".

That's IMHO the only useful aspect of this group; I don't like feeding G**gle with all that stuff otherwise.

Possibly the best idea since sliced bread! Thanks a lot for pointing it out. And yes I have been treating maintainers like they do not exist (apart David Kirkby but we seem to end up doing a lot of things together so this may explain that) which is of course terribly impolite of me.
