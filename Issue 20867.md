Everything works find, just a couple minor things

- need to wrap long doc lines

- do not need the line

`F = self.base_ring()`

- output of indet_pts: spelling of indet.

- double quote F everywhere it occurs in docs

- if not F.is_field() should be inside F is not None if branch

- need doctest to test that F works

Here are some interesting examples I was trying. They all work, so add which ever you think


```
%time
set_verbose(None)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2+y^2,y^2-z^2,x^2+z^2])
f.indeterminacy_points(F=QuadraticField(-1))
```



```
%time
set_verbose(None)
K.<t>=FunctionField(QQ)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(K,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-t^2*y^2,y^2-z^2,x^2-t^2*z^2])
f.indeterminacy_points()
```



```
%time
set_verbose(None)
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(Qp(3),2)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-7*y^2,y^2-z^2,x^2-7*z^2])
f.indeterminacy_points()
```


- you should add a warning/note of some kind in the docs about the fact that these functions do not normalize the coordinates for examples such as


```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([x*x^2,x*y^2,x*z^2])
f.indeterminacy_locus()
```
