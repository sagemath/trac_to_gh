```
$ sage -t --new

Doctesting 1 file.

The solution is a simple fix in `src/sage/doctest/control.py`.

Did you have to introduce the `testing` flag only for the doctest? Otherwise it looks like a one-line change.

You should absolutely not change any file under `$SAGE_ROOT` in doctests.

I'm fine making the one-line change without adding any doctests.  I just don't see how to doctest that it works correctly without adding a file under `$SAGE_ROOT`.

I think just make the one line change. It should be good enough. It wasn't doctested earlier, either way.
