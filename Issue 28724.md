# Issue 28724: Better class hierarchy for classical matrix Lie algebras

Right now, `ClassicalMatrixLieAlgebra` only inherits from `LieAlgebraFromAssociative`, but instead it should inherit from `MatrixLieAlgebraFromAssociative`. This way, all of its elements will be immutable after creation.

We also lift the `matrix` element method up to a more natural place from this.

I've added one more change that clears some technical debt (the Element class of gl should not be a ClassicalLieAlgebra element class), and improved the doc a bit. Tests in sage/algebra pass. LGTM!
