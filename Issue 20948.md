On Cygwin, linbox can't seem to find the installation of FFLAS-FFPACK, despite fflas_ffpack already being installed.

Or is linbox not a standard package?  I don't know what it is.

Linbox is a standard package for doing linear algebra over `\ZZ` and finite fields.

Both my cygwin32 and cygwin64 builds failed on this step. This is possibly a regression due to #20926. Checking now.

Yes, this is due to #20926; when I reverted that change, I could build linbox on Cygwin32. So would the best way forward would be to add a check against Cygwin or do something different?

It probably failed to compile a test program or something.  If #20926 added `-std=c++98` this can lead to errors in some headers in Cygwin, which is an issued I've encountered a few times in different ways.  Changing it to `-std=gnu++98` should work.

I changed it to `-std=gnu++98` and then linbox compiled just fine on Cygwin64.

Ticket #17635 now conflicts with this one, as the new releases of LinBox, !Givaro and fflas-ffpack all require `--std=c++11`.

As I'm not familiar with this cygwin issue and do not have access to a cygwin machine, could you confirm to me that adding a

```
if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
     CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=gnu++11"

Why not just add (in addition) `-fpermissive` on Cygwin?
