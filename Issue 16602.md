Keywords: hecke triangle groups

Support for coordinate vectors for quasi modular forms for hecke triangle groups.

This allows to take coordinate vectors of quasi modular forms with respect to the
(+- natural) basis of the space. As a consequence also subspaces of quasi modular
forms work. However calculations are usually quite slow/extensive.

Additionally the ticket fixes some coercion issues with subspaces, adds corresponding
further doctests and corresponding documentation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16839
