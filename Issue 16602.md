Keywords: hecke triangle groups

Support for coordinate vectors of quasi modular forms for hecke triangle groups and support for constructing quasi weakly holomorphic forms based on their initial Laurent coefficients.
It also adds functions to determine generators and dimensions of certain quasi weak subspaces.
This allows to take coordinate vectors of quasi modular forms with respect to the (+- natural) basis of the space. As a consequence also subspaces of quasi modular forms work.

However calculations are usually quite slow/extensive (for both main features).

Additionally the ticket fixes some coercion issues with subspaces, adds corresponding further doctests and corresponding documentation.

Also see Ticket #16883 which depends on this ticket.
