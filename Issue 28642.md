A bit pathological, but basically nothing visible until you test something with a high precision where there can be divergences between the two. 
If you run GSL test suite with openblas rather than gslcblas you'll get failures of the numerical noise kind.

Honestly, I am not sure which one would be used. My guess would be the first one on the list of libraries linked.

so both `libopenblas.so` and `libgslblas.so` are there. 
(I suppose it's the same with Sage-supplied GSL and OpenBLAS)

Are you saying that modifyng `gsl.pc` as suggested here would lead to skipping `libgslblas.so` ?

IMHO this would not lead to re-linking `libgsl.so` with `libopenblas.so`, if it was
already linked with `libgslblas.so`. Woulndn't is need some `LD_PRELOAD` platform-dependent `ld` hacks  --- I guess MacOS would need something quite different to achieve this.

`libgsl.so` is not linked to any blas in distros like Ubuntu. It is underlinked. In sage-the-distribution, `libgsl.so` is linked to `libopenblas` and the `-lgslcblas` line is removed from `gsl.pc`.

It is not posix full stop. I am surprised it works as suggested on freeBSD. My experience with AIX `sed`, which is posix, is that `-i` isn't supported at all. Fortunately we don't have to support such dinosaur platforms.

`@`Dima one of the purpose of `-e` is to be able to chain commands.

```
sed -i'' -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
```

is perfectly legal. Of course some line separation gain in clarity, but that's why I would break things into several line in a pure shell script

```
sed  \
       -e 's/\${GSL_CBLAS_LIB}\ //'  \
       -e 's/GSL_CBLAS_LIB.*/Require: cblas/' \
       -i'' $SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/pkgconfig/gsl.pc
