Can you give me a few days to work on this in #33213? I'm already planning to drop the removal of sage-cleaner (and the dependency on #8784) there, and to rebase it on your `sage_makedirs` branch, which I think will make this additional ticket redundant.

I'd also like to go back and clean up some of the commit messages, and don't want to proceed without knowing if the tempfile usage can be simplified wrt cygwin.
