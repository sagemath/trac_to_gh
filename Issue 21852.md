Rationale : see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JPpJvUpP1TQ).

In short, OpenSSL development interface have changed incompatibly with versions<1.1. A lot of applications have been affected. That includes "our" python (see [this python ticket](https://bugs.python.org/issue26470)) and "our" git (see #22058), which are now unable to use SSL transport when compiled against OpenSSL>=1.1. This notably impedes the use of pip.

This library has now entered mainstream Linux distributions (e. g. Debian testing) (I dunno about Windows/cygwin and Mac OS X). These distributions can no longer compile Sagemath with a functional pip.

Aaaarghhh ! You are right.

I can't test this right now (my Sage installation dates back from before the time openSSL entered the game...). I'll upgrade it to 7.5rc0 (which includes #19735), and see how well this goes.

I'll have a look at a pristine VM tonight.

Well... testing this on a machine that used to have a functional `_ssl` module in python, I now get :

The issue still stands (and is worse than previously thought of...).

Indeed, #22037 does fix the problem. This ticket should be marked as invalid/won't fix and closed. Someting I can't do myself.

I'm marking this ticket as "needs review" : plan is to mark it as "positive review" to get the attention of the release manager who *can* mar it as invalid/won't fix and close it.
