# Issue 27747: Coercion of inputs of nth_iterate into projective space

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27984

Original creator: jdoyle

Original creation time: 2019-06-13 15:51:45

Keywords: SI2019

The following code outputs an element of the integer ring instead of projective space:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
sage: Q = f.nth_iterate(0,0)
sage: Q.parent()
Integer Ring
```


Need to coerce the input into projective space when it's not already entered as such.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

I assumed that the missing milestone was 8.9

The trailing whitespace commit is now based on top of a clean copy of all the previous commits for this ticket, so this should be good to go.
