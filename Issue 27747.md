Keywords: SI2019

The following code outputs an element of the integer ring instead of projective space:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([x^2 + y^2, y^2])
sage: Q = f.nth_iterate(0,0)
sage: Q.parent()
Integer Ring
```


Need to coerce the input into projective space when it's not already entered as such.
