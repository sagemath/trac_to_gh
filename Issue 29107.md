Autoconf scripts are supposed to be POSIX sh -- not bash -- even though ours forces itself to be run with bash at the moment (chicken and egg problem). There are a few bashisms that are easy to fix:

* Two double-equals comparisons in m4/ax_check_root.m4 and build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4.
* The construction of SAGE_SCRIPTS which, it turns out, is just a static list of files anyway and shouldn't be constructed dynamically.
