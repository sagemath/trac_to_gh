Keywords: valuation

Sage makes a calculation error with valuation.

After defining

```
E = EllipticCurve('15a1')
D = -11
p = 7
P = E.heegner_point(D)
Q = P.point_exact()
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')
x = R.gen()
K.<a> = NumberField (x^2 - D)
E_K = E.base_extend(K)
I = K.ideal(p)
v = I.prime_factors()[0]
E_loc = E_K.reduction(v)
Np = E_loc.cardinality()
Q2 = Np * Q
Q2.clear_denominators()
a = Q2.xy()[0]
b = Q2.xy()[1]
c = a / b
```
we get:

```
sage: [x.valuation(v) for x in (a, b, c)]
[-1, -2, 0]
```
Clearly an error as `c.valuation(v)`
should be `1`, not `0`.

Furthermore the `v`-valuations of `b` and `c`
should add up to that of `a`.

There is a bug in a valuation, but the bug is that we didn't raise an error when 
we called with an ideal over a different number field.
Perhaps we want to add a check that `self.number_field() == P.number_field()`

```
sage: Q.curve().base_ring()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 3*x + 18
sage: a.parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 3*x + 18
sage: b.parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 3*x + 18
sage: v.parent()
Monoid of ideals of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 11
```

Furthemore, 

```
sage: v7 = a.parent().ideal(7).factor()[0][0]
sage: print(a.valuation(v7), b.valuation(v7), c.valuation(v7))
-2 -3 1
```

The issue seems to be that  `hecke_eigenvalue_field` and the base ring of `phi` are different but isomorphic.
One easy to fix the test is to have `K = phi.base_ring()` and if Marc Masdeu agrees, create another issue regarding the disparity between the presentation of `f.hecke_eigenvalue_field()` and `phi.base_ring()`.

```

Thank you very much! It looks good to me.
Feel free to change the status to a positive review once the tests pass.

Sorry about my typo.
The ideals should be `(3, 1/32*alpha + 5/2)` and `(3, 1/32*alpha + 3/2)`.
However, a better way to do this is:

```
sage: phi = ps_modsym_from_simple_modsym_space(f.modular_symbols(1))
sage: (p1, _), (p2, _) = phi.base_ring().ideal(3).factor()
sage: phi.is_ordinary(p1) != phi.is_ordinary(p2)
True
```
this avoids the awkward construction of the ideals via generators and makes clear why we choose these two ideals.
