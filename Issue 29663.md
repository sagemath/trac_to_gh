(from #29890:) broken optional packages: 
 - boost, database_stein_watkins_mini, sage_numerical_backends_cplex, sage_numerical_backends_gurobi, texlive (although why anyone would want to install texlive via Sage is baffling to me).
broken experimental packages:
 - The experimental packages are even worse: I tried most of them, and only one (compilerwrapper) succeeded.


Tickets:
 - #29174 - Remove `autotools` SPKG
 - #29897 - `database_stein_watkins_mini`
