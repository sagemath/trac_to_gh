Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

This patch adds basic reduction rules as a pre-processing of the vertex cover function. These reduction rules are the 3 first rules described for instance in 
http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~dehne/projects/clustalxp/ACFLSS.pdf, that is: (1) vertices of degree 0 are not part of the cover, (2) the neighbor of a vertex of degree 1 is in the cover, and (3) if the neighbors of a degree 2 vertex are incident, they are in the cover.

This is particularly useful for sparse graphs.

More advanced reduction rules can also be considered (crown decompositions, etc.) but are not part of this patch.

Hellooooooooooo !!!

A few comments about this patch :
* Why do you check in independent_set whether the value given by "algorithm" is good ? vertex_cover is already dealing with that, so if you forward something else the function already raises an exception
* I hesitated myself between returning lists or sets but now that all graph functions return lists I guess it is best to stick with it.. Wrapping the return value with a list() looks best `:-p`
* Gosh your docstrings are now totally spotless.. This, or we make the same mistakes, but they look totally clean to me `:-)`
* Variable ``rules_are_used`` initialized to True. What about using reduction_rules instead, as it alrady exists ?
* As it is, if the given graph is a tree you compute n/2 times the list of vertices of degree 1. That's a bit too much. I think that
  {{{
  V = [ u for u in g.vertices() if g.degree(u) == 1 ]
  }}}
  Should become
  {{{
  V = self.cores(2)[0]
  }}}
  The advantage is that this core decomposition is recursive, so after the for loop there can be no vertex of degree 1 left in the graph
  {{{
  sage: g = graphs.RandomTree(50)
  sage: g.cores(2)
  ([0, 1, 6, 14, 16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 42, 44, 46, 49, 43, 48, 5, 38, 22, 3, 7, 12, 8, 21, 10, 18, 39, 47, 19, 11, 45, 28, 35, 15, 9, 13, 30, 27, 2, 40, 41, 37, 4], [])
  }}}
  Then, instead of removing only one vertex from V you could write "for v n V" and apply you rule on each of them iteratively (after checking that they have not been removed already, or that their neighbor has.
  With a bit of luck it should also be faster (though perhaps this difference is actually hard to measure...).
* ``if v in g.neighbors(w): ``. This is True mathematically speaking, but a sin from the programming point of view. You are actually building the list of neighbors of w, then checking whether v belongs to the list when you mean "g.has_edge(v,w)" `:-p`
* Could you also add in a "TESTS::" section a small "for" loop ensuring that that the algorithms outputs the same cardinalities when reduction_rules is enabled or not ? Something like what appears at the bottom of GenericGraph.traveling_salesman_problem.

All in all, a good patch `:-)`

Replying to [comment:6 ncohen]:

> * Why do you check in independent_set whether the value given by "algorithm" is good ? vertex_cover is already dealing with that, so if you forward something else the function already raises an exception 

I have removed the test.

> * I hesitated myself between returning lists or sets but now that all graph functions return lists I guess it is best to stick with it.. Wrapping the return value with a list() looks best `:-p` 

Changed to list

> * Variable  rules_are_used  initialized to True. What about using reduction_rules instead, as it alrady exists ? 

I don't like the idea since in future improvements of the function one may need the original value of !`reduction_rules` later in the algorithm. 

> * As it is, if the given graph is a tree you compute n/2 times the list of vertices of degree 1. That's a bit too much. ...... Then, instead of removing only one vertex from V you could write "for v n V" and apply you rule on each of them iteratively (after checking that they have not been removed already, or that their neighbor has. With a bit of luck it should also be faster (though perhaps this difference is actually hard to measure...). 

I'm now using the cores.

Note however that what you said is not exact. When removing the neighbor of a degree one vertex from the graph, it is possible reduce the degree of some vertices to 0 or 1. These vertices are not identified by the cores function. They will thus be considered only at next iteration of the main while loop.

> *  if v in g.neighbors(w):  . This is True mathematically speaking, but a sin from the programming point of view. You are actually building the list of neighbors of w, then checking whether v belongs to the list when you mean "g.has_edge(v,w)" `:-p` 

I was not sure of the best solution to choose when writing the function because I don't know how the neighbors function is written. I did proposed modification.

> * Could you also add in a "TESTS::" section a small "for" loop ensuring that that the algorithms outputs the same cardinalities when reduction_rules is enabled or not ? Something like what appears at the bottom of GenericGraph .traveling_salesman_problem. 

Done. I have also move some test from independent_set to vertex_cover.

I have also updated the tests in the tsp function, translating sentences from french to english ;-)

Thanks for your help Nathann, and congratulation for the CNRS ranking !!!

> Note however that what you said is not exact. When removing the neighbor of a degree one vertex from the graph, it is possible reduce the degree of some vertices to 0 or 1. These vertices are not identified by the cores function. They will thus be considered only at next iteration of the main while loop.

Oh right, you also remove neighbors... Well, at least for trees everything is removed in only one run `:-D`

But actually, that was the whole point of my first remark --copy/paste the code from "cores" and modify it so that this problem is solved. Its principle is actually very simple : "first compute the degree of all the vertices in your graph and keep them in a table for quick access. For as long as there is a vertex of degree 1, remove it and update the degree of its neighbors in the table."
You would only have to say instead "for as long as there is a vertex of degree 1, delete both vertices and update the degree of its distance-2 neighbors."
This "cores" function is not "so very smart", but it is very small and efficient with memory.

By the way there is a set method to remove an element regardless of whether it is already inside or not : set.discard

Oh my god, some tests were written in french ? `:-D`

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks ! `:-D`

Helloooooooooooo !!!

Here is what this patch does :

* avoid copying G for nothing when the reduction rules are not used (which is the case by default)
* uses the graph's structure instead of doing the same job with dictionaries
* several caches or small optimizations, or shortenings.
* a small amount of comments in the code
* moved a whole block of code back to the original indentation level (the main code was indented because of a test "if g.order() == 0"...)

This being said, since your last version the "good sides" of the "cores" algorithm are used ! The list of vertices of small degree is not rebuilt n times but generated on the fly, so that only vertices whose degree has changed are checked `:-)`

Arghh!!! I found a small bug: with the contraction of some vertices, we may create multi-edges, thus leading to an error since the degree is different from the size of the neighborhood.
This is a side effect of the merge_vertices method because my graph has weighted edges.

So far, my first option is instead to use a copy of the graph to make my own copy without edge labels. This is certainly not the best solution...

A smarter solution is more than welcome.

Hellooooooooo David !!

Well, the patch seems good to go, but there is one thing that should be changed : one of the two tests deals with randomGNP graphs, and tests the algorithms on instances of ``graphs.RandomGNP(20,.3)``.

Now the problem is that this actually does not test the reductions rules :

```
sage: all(min(graphs.RandomGNP(50,.3).degree())>2 for i in range(100))
True
```


Could you change the .3 to something like 4/50 ? It looks better this way :

```
sage: graphs.RandomGNP(50,4/50).cores(k=2)

So the rules are actually being tested `:-)`

You can set the ticket to "positive review" afterwards, for the ticket is good to go `:-)`

Thank for this patch !

Actually reduction rules were already tested with trees ;-)

I have modified the RandomGNP test and all tests pass on my computer.

Thank for the review.

Yeah yeah, but only the rule with vertices of degree 1, so... `:-)`

Not necessarily since there is no correlation between the vertices in the set of vertices of degree at most 2 and the degree of the vertices. So all rules can be used.
