CC:  tscrim jdemeyer aapitzsch dkrenn cheuberg behackl

Currently cmp(a,b) for two real-interval field elements performs a lexicographic comparison. And rich comparison has a different semantic.

We rename `_cmp_` to `lexico_cmp` to put it outside the comparison framework. This means that `cmp` will not work anymore. The documentation is modified accordingly, to warn users not to use `cmp` at all on these objects.

Helpful for the major ticket #22297

Do we need `lexico_cmp` at all or could we simply delete it?

As `cmp` is removed, do we need a deprecation warning for this?
