Following the discussion at â€‹https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tyAxhqxk3ZI/SuBg2Ukwwj4J

When one creates the additive group `Z/nZ`, it would be nice to be able to use integers and cast them as members of this group. However :


```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([5]); G(1)
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
```


The same way with free modules :


```
sage: G=FreeModule(ZZ,1); G(1)  
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
```


This patch makes it possible :


```
sage: G=AdditiveAbelianGroup([5]); G(1)
(1)
sage: G=FreeModule(ZZ,1); G(1)         
(1)
```

That's not what you're asking sage to do. You're asking for a finite abelian group, written additively, that happens to be cyclic of order 5. If you know your group is going to be cyclic, you'd probably be better off asking for a cyclic group explicitly.

So I'd agree with Volker that lists are more natural here. At the same time you're asking for conversion, which is supposed to make a best effort, so adding a special case wouldn't be out of the question, even if it's an ugly special case.

If there exists an Additive Cyclic group somewhere, I agree.

And you would like that the following works ?

sage: V = VectorSpace(RR,1)
sage: V(4.123)

If you want want a cyclic group with nice map Z -> Z/nZ then just use `IntegerModRing`.

The notation that you propose can certainly be implemented, but its a confusing special case that can't work for a general Abelian group. So -1 from me, consistency is more important than saving two keystrokes.
