# Issue 18964: FiniteStateMachine.disjoint_union: fix doctests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19201

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2015-09-13 17:09:21

CC:  skropf dkrenn

Keywords: disjoint_union, documentation

In `FiniteStateMachine.disjoint_union`, doctests had Automata with output letters.
Remove those output letters.

Furthermore, fix the labels of the states in the final example in order to be more robust with respect to random order of the states due to sets used in determinisation. Otherwise, a minor modification in #19199 would lead to other labels and breaking the doctest.
