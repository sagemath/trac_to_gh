#21879 implements `is_injective` on the level of a category's `MorphismMethods`. However, these are currently not shown in tab completion:

```
sage: f = QQ.hom(QQ)
sage: f.is_inj<TAB> # offers no completion
```

```
from .misc import dir_with_other_class
```

importing does add a measurable penalty, even if the binding is already present. So you should not do that in code that might end up in a critical loop (such as method lookup)


```
def f(N):
    m=0
    for n in xrange(N):
        from sage.structure.misc import dir_with_other_class
        m+=1
    return m

def g(N):
    m=0
    for n in xrange(N):
        m+=1
    return m

sage: %timeit f(1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.38 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g(1000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 127 µs per loop
```


There are already imports from sage.structure.misc in that file, so I think you can just import the method on the module level.

Is that really an issue? If I understand your test case correctly, this costs about 1µs. `dir` is so slow that this does probably not make a difference:

```
sage: %timeit dir(1)
1000 loops, best of 3: 608 µs per loop
```


If I am not mistaken, `__dir__` is not used in attribute lookup. At least https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html says that `__dir__` is "Called when dir() is called on the object.
