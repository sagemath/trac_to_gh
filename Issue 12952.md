CC:  polybori malb burcin

PolyBoRi's next minor release will be out soon.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.2 and 0.8.1, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.2rc

PolyBoRi 0.8.2 is a bugfix release incorporating all previous patches from Sage.

That makes sense, you you should really make sure that the upstream polybori-0.8.2 is **identical** to the Sage polybori-0.8.2.

Believe me, I have seen this kind of problems in the past with other packages where the upstream version was close to, but not quite equal to the Sage version.
