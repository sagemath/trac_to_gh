this is wrong:

sage: z= I*sqrt(-3)
sage: z.conjugate()
-I*sqrt(-3)

This is probably followup to #8775.  Certainly it is a Ginac issue, isn't it?  (We'll eventually want to confirm this and report upstream.)

Meaning that #8775 fixed the issue for basic functions, but apparently it doesn't propagate somehow to products.

I sent an email about this to `ginac-devel`. It didn't show up yet, so I can't link to the thread. I can include a fix in the next pynac release if there is a fix in the next couple of days.
