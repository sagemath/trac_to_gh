# Issue 23946: Generate eclib includes in a predictable order

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Cython 0.28 will change the way how #includes are put in the generated C file. The ordering of includes now depends on the contents of the `cdef extern` block. This breaks the `eclib` includes. The easiest fix is to start with a bunch of empty `cdef extern` blocks to fix the order.
