# Issue 19369: Fix a few dependencies

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19606

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-11-20 12:43:37

CC:  vbraun leif rws

After upgrading MPIR, not all modules depending on MPIR are rebuilt. The offending modules are

```
sage/ext/interrupt/interrupt.so
sage/symbolic/substitution_map.so
sage/symbolic/constants_c.so
sage/symbolic/expression.so
sage/symbolic/getitem.so
```


This is because some dependencies are wrong.

Why remove it when the next version (#19312) needs it again?

? Pynac (i.e., the extension module) _does_ use GMP for binomial coefficients.  But you probably meant _GiNaC_ in the commit message.

I meant `pynac` the library.

That's irrelevant. The wrong dependency causes problems now, so it needs to be fixed independently of #19312.

Changing keywords from "" to "overlinking, MPIR".
