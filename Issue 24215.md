Keywords: doc, PARI group

The ["PARI groups" page in the SageMath documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/pari_group.html) has examples where the output is a PARI group.

A link to the [PARI/GP documentation for polgalois](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/General_number_fields.html#polgalois)
would be helpful to make more sense of this output.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24452
