# Issue 12139: In spkgs, run testcc.sh and testcxx.sh without explicit path

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2012-01-15 09:28:13

Assignee: tbd

#11073 changes the location of `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` to `spkg/bin`.  The following spkgs refer explicitly to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh`:
 * singular
 * cliquer
 * rubiks
 * sympow

The following spkgs have `testcc.sh` included in the spkg:
 * libm4ri
 * libm4rie

`testcxx.sh` is never used.

Here are spkgs which make the remaining changes. (Since the necessary changes are mostly trivial, I thought we could deal with them all on this ticket.) Is it worth changing `dir-0.1-install`, since that file is likely to disappear anyway? I'll provide a patch for that, too, in case we want to use it for testing.

in `SPKG.txt`,

```
### rubiks-20070912.p17 (John Palmieri, 23 March 2012)
```

should be

```
### rubiks-20070912.p18 (John Palmieri, 23 March 2012)
```

Looks good to me, thanks!

I propose not to apply the SAGE_ROOT patch and leave that to #12631.
