# Issue 21410: Doctest continuation marked / combinat

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21647

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-10-05 09:52:48

CC:  paulmasson tscrim

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in combinat folder.

Done by


```
find src/sage/combinat/ -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```

Travis, want to take one more?

(I suppose that about half of these will go to beta in every round, so this should be done when 7.5 is out.)

You also need to remove the `...` after such blocks (or change them to `....:`), otherwise they are treated as possible output (which is to say, it can absorb anything).

Why I get 500 Internal server error when clicking the branch?

Good point. Done that.
