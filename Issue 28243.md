While innocent looking, this feature is a first step towards bandwidth saving. At least, it reduces overall code length.

For what is worth, the next step is to have a lazy `OEISSequence` that could exist as soon as its ID is known, and fetch data on the internet only when needed, not during `__init__`. Then, we will be able to use local data as well (e.g. for first terms and name). Then, we will have some overflow detection, that will advise the user who uses oeis online intensively to fetch some data once for all. This is how i currently plan to split the various tickets. The global goal is to save bandwidth, protect oeis servers from brute force searches, and allow faster searches. I plan to push a step only when the previous is merged to avoid rebasing between tickets.
