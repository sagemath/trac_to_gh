code below generate error


```
var('t')
h(t)=sqrt(  abs( -2*I*cos(t)*sin(t) + 2*sin(t)^2 )  )
#h(t)=sqrt(-2*I*cos(t)*sin(t) + 2*sin(t)^2)

show('h(2) =\t ',h(2),'\t h(2) numerical =\t ',h(2).n())
show('h(t) canonicalize_radical =\t ',h.canonicalize_radical())

show('h(t) =\t ',h.simplify_full())
```




## TypeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: sign: argument cannot be imaginary; found %i

I have two merge requests open with maxima fixing sign issues (https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/merge-requests/26/, https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/merge-requests/27/). You can try and see if those fix the issue.
