# Issue 14854: export TERMINFO in sage shell script

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15091

the place of terminfo is hardcoded in libtinfo.so which presents a problem for relocating the Sage tree. Hence, we should set the TERMINFO variable to make sure ncurses can still find terminal information after such a relocation.

Thanks, looks good!

I'm making this a blocker since afaik we do have a policy to support relocation and this patch is both simple and necessary.
