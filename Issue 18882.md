After #19101, `sage -f PKG` first deletes `local/var/lib/sage/installed/PKG-*` and then runs `sage -i PKG`.

I propose to move the rule of removing `local/var/lib/sage/installed/PKG-*` to `build/make/Makefile` as a `PKG-clean` target. This would make it easier to extend the functionality of `sage -f FOO` to non-packages, for example

```
sage -f optional   # force install all optional packages
sage -f python     # force install correct version of Python (python2 or python3 package)
```

If I run `sage -i python` or `sage -f python`, I get

```
Error: package 'python' not found
Assuming it is an old-style package... (this is deprecated: use -p instead of -i to install old-style packages)

Attempting to download package python
Error: could not find a package matching python
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: cython, ipython, python2, python3, patch?
```

If I run `make python`, I get

```
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `python'.  Stop.
```

This is despite the line

```
PYTHON = $(PYTHON2)
```

in `build/make/Makefile`.

Or maybe that's not the point of this ticket, and this just adds `PKG-clean`. That part works well.

I don't see why... so far Sage has always appended log files and I see no reason to change that on this ticket.
