Keywords: classical crystals, letters

We have a crystal of letters for all of the other classical types. We implement this by wrapping Nakajima monomials.

This will also be useful for constructing KR tableaux for types F<sub>4</sub><sup>(1)</sup>, E<sub>6</sub><sup>(2)</sup>, and E<sub>8</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (followup of #19598).
