# Issue 19533: Implement crystal of letters for type F_4 and E_8

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19770

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-12-23 16:05:41

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: classical crystals, letters

We have a crystal of letters for all of the other classical types. We implement this by wrapping Nakajima monomials.

This will also be useful for constructing KR tableaux for types F<sub>4</sub><sup>(1)</sup>, E<sub>6</sub><sup>(2)</sup>, and E<sub>8</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (followup of #19598).
