I'm getting these doctest failures on a Python 2 of Sage:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py", line 62, in sage.symbolic.maxima_wrapper.MaximaWrapper.__init__
Failed example:
    s.completions('u.elliptic_',globals())
Expected:
    ['u.elliptic_e', 'u.elliptic_ec', 'u.elliptic_eu', 'u.elliptic_f', 'u.elliptic_kc', 'u.elliptic_pi']
Got:
    [u'u.elliptic_e',
     u'u.elliptic_ec',
     u'u.elliptic_eu',
     u'u.elliptic_f',
     u'u.elliptic_kc',
     u'u.elliptic_pi']
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py", line 81, in sage.symbolic.maxima_wrapper.MaximaWrapper.__getattr__
Failed example:
    s.completions('u.airy_',globals())
Expected:
    ['u.airy_ai', 'u.airy_bi', 'u.airy_dai', 'u.airy_dbi']
Got:
    [u'u.airy_ai', u'u.airy_bi', u'u.airy_dai', u'u.airy_dbi']
**********************************************************************
```


This is on a system where I also test Python 3, so maybe there is some "corrupted" global state?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
