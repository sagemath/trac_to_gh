# Issue 26679: sage-spkg-uninstall doesn't uninstall some directories

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26916

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-12-19 15:55:08

Normally, when `sage-spkg-uninstall` removes a file, it checks if the directory that contained that file is empty, and if so it removes the directory as well.

However, if a directory contains only subdirectories and no normal files, it fails to remove that directory.

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Removing most of the rest of my open tickets out of the 8.7 milestone, which should be closed.
