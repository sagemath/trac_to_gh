# Issue 26852: CPLEXBackend.solver_parameter: Handle CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27089

In current versions of CPLEX, we can't set CPX_PARAM_ITLIM because it has the unhandled param type CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG, which we mistake as a string parameter.

Right, we should include `CPXsetlongparam` and `CPXgetlongparam`, and add relevant tests in method `solver_parameter`. I don't know however if we need to import type `CPXLONG`.

This should do the job.

Some methods were declared twice in `cplex_backend.pxd`. I also fixed that.

Very minor change to avoid possible conflict with #27790

I have rebuild this ticket over #28382 and used correct type (long long instead of long). This way we have no compilation warning.
