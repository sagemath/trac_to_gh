In current versions of CPLEX, we can't set CPX_PARAM_ITLIM because it has the unhandled param type CPX_PARAMTYPE_LONG, which we mistake as a string parameter.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27089

Right, we should include `CPXsetlongparam` and `CPXgetlongparam`, and add relevant tests in method `solver_parameter`. I don't know however if we need to import type `CPXLONG`.

Some methods were declared twice in `cplex_backend.pxd`. I also fixed that.
