The method `EllipticCurve_number_field.is_isogenous()` computes norms of ideals of the base field using the `norm()` method.  To make this work in the case where the base field is a relative number field, one has to use the `absolute_norm()` method instead:

```
sage: k.<s> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: K.<b> = k.extension(x^2 - 3)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(k, [-3*s*(4 + 5*s), 2*s*(2 + 14*s + 11*s^2)])
sage: Ec = EllipticCurve(k, [3*s*(4 - 5*s), -2*s*(2 - 14*s + 11*s^2)])
sage: EK = E.base_extend(K)
sage: EcK = Ec.base_extend(K)
sage: EK.is_isogenous(EcK)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: For a fractional ideal in a relative number field you must use relative_norm or absolute_norm as appropriate
```

ok, looks good to me.

I have not checked the timings. If you care about that, put back to needs review.
