Keywords: thursdaysbdx

The goal of this ticket is to

- package Kim Walish's `primecount` package (the version of `prime_pi`
  in Sage has bugs, see #24960)
- provide an experimental interface to it in `arith/prime_pi.pyx` (that will
  be merged with the current `prime_pi` in Sage in #25009).

Note that

- `primecount`'s build system uses cmake, which needs an upgrade (see #25109)
- the latest release of `primecount` should work on both big-endian and little-indian
  processors but has been tested successfully
- linking on Mac OSX looks fishy but seems to work fine

Tarball (to be renamed `primecount-4.3.tar.gz` in Sage):

- https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/archive/v4.3.tar.gz

This ticket led to opening and solving an upstream issue,
leading to improvements in the build and documentation:

We are [told](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/hXZmkYwOvfg/4k5TbhGYCAAJ) that this is little-endian only. So this in its present form can at best become an experimental package, AFAIK.

Build and passes its test suite on power7 - not inside a sage install, I assume I was requested to see if it was working on the hardware.

I sniffed the `CMakeList.txt` and I want someone to test it inside sage on a mac. I suspect the `install_name` are not set properly but I could miss something, so the proof is in the pudding.

Tested under macOS 10.10.5. The package installs fine, and `sage -t` gives "All tests passed!".

I'm not so happy to abuse `compile_time_env` for every optional package. First of all, it leads to ugly code (`IF`s all over the place) and second, it requires a complete reinstallation of the Sage library whenever a new package is installed.

Why not use the `OptionalExtension` mechanism for this?

Can you give the output of `otool -L local/lib/libprimecount.dylib` (or whatever is the correct name for that library).

That symbol is not quoted directly in the source code. So it has to be generated, I think something may select the wrong version of OS X as the target. What version of xcode do you actually use? This is probably fixable.

Also and I should have mentioned that earlier can you pass the following option to cmake ` -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON` so we have a verbose output and see what it is doing during make.

Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and including the log file
  /Users/admin/sage/logs/pkgs/primecount-4.3.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/Users/admin/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/primecount-4.3 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '/Users/admin/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/primecount-4.3' && '/Users/admin/sage/sage' --sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
