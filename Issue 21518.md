In #20241, the Cython methods `new_gen()` and `new_gen_noclear()` of `sage.libs.pari.pari_instance` were made into public Cython functions in the new module `sage.libs.pari.stack`.  The related method `new_ref()` was made into a private Cython function in `sage.libs.pari.gen`.  We export this function because it is useful for #15601 and possibly elsewhere.
