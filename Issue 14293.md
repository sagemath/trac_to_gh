Please no catch-all except: blocks (think KeyboardInterrupt). How about a doctest to make sure that it stays fixed?

This is not meant to be an actual patch, but it's my preliminary fix that I use for other computations. I plan to prepare a real patch in Summer during Sage Days in Leiden.

Anyway.Thanks for having a look at this so quickly.

I just saw that I have the same bug in `__pow__` and will add the fix to this patch as well.

done - though I am not very certain what the Sage convention is to define `0^0`.
