In `src/sage/categories/additive_magmas.py`, there is


```
class AdditiveMagmas(Category_singleton):
    class ParentMethods:
        def summation(self, x, y):
            return x._add_(y)
```


It's dangerous to call `_add_` without checking. Either this should just be `x + y`, or there should be type checking for `x` and `y`.
