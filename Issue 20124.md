The PPL backend sets up a new PPL problem and re-solves it from scratch every time that `get_variable_value` or `get_objective_value` is called.


```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='ppl', maximization=True)
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: p.set_objective(p.sum((i+20)*x[i] for i in range(1000)))
sage: p.add_constraint(p.sum((i+15)*x[i] for i in range(1000)), max=20000)
sage: x.set_max(1)
sage: p.solve()  # takes a few seconds
11438750/507
sage: p.get_objective_value()  # takes a few seconds, should be instant
11438750/507
sage: p.get_values(x)  # takes forever, should be instant
```
