I suggest you also deprecate `optimized_subfields()` then.

Will do. Should I be starting a new ticket for that? Or should I just include it in this one?

I think `optimized_representation()` is ready.

I'll fix `optimized_subfields()` in a later ticket after figuring out what it's suppose to do. It's giving me more subfields than I expect. (ex. `K.<a> = NumberField([x^2+p for p in [2,3]]).absolute_field(); len(K.optimized_subfields())` returns 7 though I expect 5.)
