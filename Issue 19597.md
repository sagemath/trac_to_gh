Probably just another symbolic function would suffice.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_constants

This would be needed for zeta expansion and special values.

For the sake of representation: should there be two separate functions, say `stieltjes(n)` and `generalized_stieltjes(n, a)` represented as `\gamma_n` and `\gamma_n(a)`, respectively?

Of course, like `stieltjes(0)` should return `euler_gamma`, `generalized_stieltjes(n, 1)` should return `stieltjes(n)` -- but I think this can be done easily, either still in pynac, or after registering the function in sage.

... or just `stieltjes(n, a=1)` with adaptive representation. That's probably more elegant. ;-)

This is what Sage needs to use the current pynac git master implementation of Stieltjes constants (not generalized).

Why are you making `cdef object py_stieltjes` a `cdef` function? A `cdef` function that takes as input a Python object, returns a Python object would and only contains Python code would better be a `def` function.

Ho I see. This is actually needed for the array of functions.

Yes, everything symbolic is rooted through Pynac, so `ex.n()` calls Pynac's `evalf` functions which call (indirectly) Python functions which therefore must be `cdef`.

I just resolved the merge conflict with `7.1.beta1`.

Implementation looks fine to me; doctests pass. I'd still like to see if the patchbot is satisfied, too. I'll set this to `positive_review` later---or you can do so directly, if you do not want to wait. `;-)`
