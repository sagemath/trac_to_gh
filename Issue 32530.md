Outsource initialization and very basic access (Vrepresentation, Hrepresentation, backend, base_ring) to a base class `Polyhedron_base0`.

Should `dim`, `ambient_dim` rather be in `base_convex`?

I think your suggestion makes more sense. They are not needed there yet, except for `__repr__`, which should also move up, as it isn't complete then.

Regarding the names, I don't know what makes most sense. I was thinking `base0.py` etc., as it is clear then, what the order is. However, we are not doing cython, so we don't need to be strict with inheritance and could use names also and try to have it more or less consistent.

The random failure 

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=77478494819088915365500074763386376542 src/sage/rings/continued_fraction.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/continued_fraction.py", line 265, in sage.rings.continued_fraction.rat_interval_cf_list
```

is probably not from this ticket.

`base0` is fine, I think

pyflakes reports:

```
src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py:42:1 'sage.misc.superseded.deprecated_function_alias' imported but unused
```
