There is an inconsistency in the interface between fields and vector spaces.


```
sage: F.<a>=GF(9)
sage: V=F.vector_space()
sage: V(a)
(0, 1)
sage: G.<b>=GF(3)
sage: W=G.vector_space()
sage: W(b)
...
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list

The cause is

sage: a._vector_()
(0, 1)
sage: b._vector_()
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int' object has no attribute '_vector_'
```


Adding a `_vector_` method to the `GF(p)` elements will be a simple fix.

Note that the following also works

```
sage: K = GF(9)
sage: V = VectorSpace(K, 1)
sage: V(K.an_element())

Hence I guess that a default `_vector_` at the category level would actually make sense.

`_vector_` is anyhow related with some vector space, the precise meaning of which would depend on the kind of rings. For GF(9), it is a 2-dimensional vector space over GF(3) while for GF(3), it is a vector space over itself. You implemented `_vector_` assuming that the parent ring is seen as a vector space over itself, disregarding the kind of of the ring.

The part that was missing in the current implementation is the basic construction `ring -> one dimensional vector space over this ring`. This construction makes sense for any ring and hence makes sense in Sage category framework.

You are right that for *some* specific ring, there might be other natural vector spaces. In this case it is possible to add more specialized implementations. And this is exactly what is being done for finite fields.

(1) You added `vector_space` method to the fields category. How can this be useful at all? You can always construct the vector spaces directly by `QQ*n`.

(2)  About `_matrix_` method: Its docstring says "Return the matrix of right multiplication by the element on the power basis `1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{d-1}` for the field extension.  Thus the \emph{rows} of this matrix give the images of each of the `x^i`." So we have


```
sage: b=a^10
sage: v=b._vector_()
sage: m=a._matrix_()
sage: w=(a*b)._vector_()
sage: m*v == w
True
```


Shouldn't this be called the "matrix of left multiplication by the element a"? And the columns of this matrix give the images of `x^i`?

(3) The `reverse` argument for `_matrix_` method corresponds to `reverse`ed `_vector_`. Therefore I expect `m*v == w` still holds with reversed versions. But

```
sage: v=b._vector_(reverse=True)
sage: m=a._matrix_(reverse=True)
sage: w=(a*b)._vector_(reverse=True)
sage: m*v == w
False
sage: m*v
(1, 1, 1, 1)
sage: w
(1, 1, 1, 0)
sage: 
```

I think this is a bug. Why does transposing the matrix gives what we want? The correct way would be reversing all columns and all rows.

By the way, you changed the docstring for `reverse` argument. But the original one makes more sense.

Before:

```
sage: K.<a>=QQ.extension(x^2-2)
sage: K.vector_space()

(Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field, Isomorphism map:
   From: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
   To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2, Isomorphism map:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
   To:   Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field)
sage: a.vector()
(0, 1)
sage: vector(a)
(0, 1)
```


After your patch:

```
sage: a.vector()
(0, 1)
sage: vector(a)
(a)
```


So `.vector()` and `._vector_()` should be context-sensitive.

Adding `_vector_` to a category level would incur much work to make existing parents conform to the new organization. It may be possible and in the long run is a way to go. But in this particular case, I think that the gain is small compared to the needed efforts. 

I uploaded an alternative simple way to fix the bug. This just does a small thing to squeeze the bug. If you agree, then you may merge it with your other changes.
