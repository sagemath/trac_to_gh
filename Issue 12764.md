# Issue 12764: Adding plots should (at least attempt to) preserve legend options

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mjo

Assignee: jason, was

The `__add__()` method of plots doesn't make any attempt to preserve legend options. This will show the default legend:


```
sage: p1 = plot(x, x, -1, 1, legend_label='foo')
sage: p2 = p1 + p1                              
sage: p2
```


We do preserve some other information, so it should be easy to add this.

This is a nice improvement, but the patch does not apply for me on Sage-5.0.rc0. Either it has to be rebased, or there are some dependencies.

Not only that, but I forgot to set any options in the description =)

I just built rc1 and will fix it.

Merge plot options the same way we do other keyword arguments.

Should be fixed now. It looks like that method was just moved to `graphics.py`.
