Assignee: jason, was

The `__add__()` method of plots doesn't make any attempt to preserve legend options. This will show the default legend:


```
sage: p1 = plot(x, x, -1, 1, legend_label='foo')
sage: p2 = p1 + p1                              
sage: p2
```


We do preserve some other information, so it should be easy to add this.

This is a nice improvement, but the patch does not apply for me on Sage-5.0.rc0. Either it has to be rebased, or there are some dependencies.
