We have to be careful. My memory tells me cypari and `gphelp -raw` needs the documentation installed including the raw `tex` files - uncompressed. In the case of `Catalan` a run with `strace` tells me `gphelp` opens `usersch3.tex`.

it should be

```

not just

```
+pari-gp --setopt=tsflags=
```

to prevent bootstrap for pulling these two things apart.

OK, this works, positive review. 

The next obstacle on Fedora 31: there is no openblas.pc, and
so I cooked up one, put it somewhere, pointed PKG_CONFIG_PATH there,
then openblas is recognised along with R, gsl, etc, but `make` ends with


```

make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/home/dima/sagetrac-mirror/src/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc', needed by '/home/dima/sagetrac-mirror/local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc'.  Stop.
