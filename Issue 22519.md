Here is a start, but it doesn't fix the problem with Python 2 breaking Python 3, since I don't know what's going on. I bumped the version number to force a rebuild, since anyone using OS X is likely to currently have a broken Python 3 build.

By the way, some of the changes were just to decrease differences between the `spkg-install` scripts for `python2` and `python3`. There is two parts in the `python2` script which is not in `python3`:

```
# Use EXTRA_CFLAGS for user-defined CFLAGS since Python puts its own
# default flags like -O3 after CFLAGS but before EXTRA_CFLAGS.
# We also disable warnings about unused variables/functions which are
# common in Cython-generated code.
export EXTRA_CFLAGS="`testcflags.sh -Wno-unused` $CFLAGS"
unset CFLAGS
```

and the lines surrounding

```
    cp -rp "${xcode}"/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift-migrator/sdk/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/openssl "$CUR"/include
```

This second one is broken even for `python2`, so no need to do it for `python3`. I don't know about the first chunk.

The error with `python3` seems to be that the first python to build gets the link python to python$version. So the problem is that `python2.7/encodings/__init__.py` is not compatible with python3. Not sure what's happening to python2 when python3 is build first. It is a bit strange that it uses the link rather than the fully versioned directory. And obviously it doesn't happen on linux, or does it?

Do we need the symlink (in `local/lib`) `python2.7 -> python`, or can we get by with two directories `python2.7` and `python3.5`, no symlinks? It seems odd that we have to create it manually. If Python really needed it, it would create it on its own, wouldn't it?

`fpylll` is a similar problem to https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv/issues/45. It could be linked to locale settings if I believe the last comment.
According to file, the file is ASCII, but python thinks it has utf8 in it.

Sure, I think it can go in that state. Then I can some more stuff to both python2 and 3 later. Hope I can get around to it.

Interesting experience. #12426 can still be tweaked, but yes we may want to prevent users to shoot themselves too much in the foot. `python` is somewhat ok because it is C and not C++ you can compile it with clang and mostly use it with gcc. Anything that would require clang++ would be in a load of troubles.

While I don't want to impose things too strongly, I am very much of a mind to put my foot down on the compiler to be used on OS X.
