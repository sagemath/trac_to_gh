Projective equality is returning false positives for ComplexIntervalField points because it is doing a negative check not a positive check


```
R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
r=(x^2-x-3).polynomial(x).roots(ComplexIntervalField(),multiplicities=False)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ComplexIntervalField(),1)
P1=P(r[0],1)
H=End(P)
f = H([x^2-3*y^2,y^2])
Q1=f(P1)
Q1==P1, Q1[0]==P1[0]
```


This is likely an issue for both points and morphisms.
