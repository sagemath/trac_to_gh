# Issue 26468: Fix is_formal for hyperplane arrangements with no cycles

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26705

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2018-11-15 22:07:13


```
sage: w = WeylGroup(['A',4]).from_reduced_word([3,4,2,1])
sage: I = w.inversion_arrangement()
sage: I.minimal_generated_number()
4
sage: I.is_formal()
False
sage: I
Arrangement <a4 | a1 | a1 + a2 | a1 + a2 + a3 + a4>
```

The problem is that there are no circuits, so this should return 0.
