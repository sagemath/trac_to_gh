bot is morally green.

There is one potentially controversial change, 

```diff
     sage: gb = d_basis(I); gb
-    [z - 107196348594952664476180297953816049406949517534824683390654620424703403993052759002989622,
-    y + 84382748470495086324437828161121754084154498572003307352857967748090984550697850484197972764799434672877850291328840,
-    x + 105754645239745824529618668609551113725317621921665293762587811716173,
-    282687803443]
+    [z ..., y ..., x ..., 282687803443]
```

where the important part of the result is the last integer. The 3 previous linear polynomials are only unique modulo this integer, and random otherwise.

I think this change is fine. It shows a little bit more of what is important for that test and makes the test look cleaner.
