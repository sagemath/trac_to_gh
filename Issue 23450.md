This is [known to work in debian](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/8LLsdHPAPXc/J9iZDZNGBQAJ), but
needs at least newer gc version, maybe more.

The GC update is handled on #23700 and #23701.

One also needs to bump up tachyon to version 0.99, and giac, too: the current Sage's giac's building dies with g++ (5.4.0) internal compiler error...

See also #16918, though [comment:2:ticket:16918 this comment] perhaps indicates it is no longer an issue.
