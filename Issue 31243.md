# Issue 31243: Fix incorrect lazy imports at startup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31480

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2021-03-10 10:00:40

CC:  mkoeppe

Keywords: lazy import, tab completion

Hitting tab completion after


```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: P.f_vector(
```


exposes incorrect lazy imports. We fix them. This will lead to hard crash of sage in ipython <7.20.0. In #31476 we will downgrade ipython again to recover Python 3.6 support.



Upgrading ipython would resolve the hard #31373

I decided to move this up to blocker, because it has a super easy and unproblematic fix and it is very annoying when sage crashes hard.

Thank you. I realized this is much easier (and stable) then an ipython upgrade.
