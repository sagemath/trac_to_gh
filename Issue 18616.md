# Issue 18616: Include farey_symbol.h instead of manually declaring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18853

Cython generates the file `sage/modular/arithgroup/farey_symbol.h`, we should use it!

This also serves as an extra test-case for the including/installation/cleaning of Cython-generated header files.

Looks trivial. Any reasons `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` are in a separate call of `include_directories.extend`?

Nothing fundamental. I just wanted to separate the `SAGE_SRC` and the `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` directories to highlight better the symmetry.
