# Issue 31574: singular build failure with Sage 9.3 source

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31811

Original creator: zimmerma

Original creation time: 2021-05-11 08:57:42

Sage 9.3 fails to compile from source on my laptop (Ubuntu 18.04). The error comes from Singular:

```
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++: fatal error: cannot execute 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory
```

I attach the Singular build log.

We also need the top-level `config.log`

We have tested thoroughly on `ubuntu-bionic`. Perhaps it's time for a fresh OS installation?


```
# ls -l /usr/bin/*g++*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       5 May 20  2019 /usr/bin/g++ -> g++-7
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      22 Dec  4  2019 /usr/bin/g++-7 -> x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-7
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       5 May 20  2019 /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-g++ -> g++-7
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1047488 Dec  4  2019 /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-7
```

What does it look like on your system?

I get the same output (apart from the additional clang++):

```
zimmerma@mure:/usr/local/sage-9.3$ ls -l /usr/bin/*g++*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      27 May 16  2018 /usr/bin/clang++ -> ../lib/llvm-6.0/bin/clang++
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      27 Apr  6  2018 /usr/bin/clang++-6.0 -> ../lib/llvm-6.0/bin/clang++
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       5 May 20  2019 /usr/bin/g++ -> g++-7
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      22 Dec  4  2019 /usr/bin/g++-7 -> x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-7
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       5 May 20  2019 /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-g++ -> g++-7
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1047488 Dec  4  2019 /usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-g++-7
```

sorry my fault. I had another g++ installation somewhere in my path. We can close this.
