# Issue 12119: Unconditionally set PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME in sage-env

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12291

`sage-env` contains:

```
if [ -d "$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python" ]; then
    PYTHONPATH="$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python"
    if [ -n "$SAGE_PATH" ]; then
        PYTHONPATH="$SAGE_PATH:$PYTHONPATH"
    fi
    PYTHONHOME="$SAGE_ROOT/local"
    export PYTHONPATH
    export PYTHONHOME
fi
```


I see no reason to set these environment variables _only_ if Python is already installed.  On the contrary, I think they are good to have during the "testing" part of the Python spkg.

Never mind, this can actually _cause_ build failures of Python.
