Reported by John Cremona on sage-devel. Brial fails to build because no `pkg-config` command can be found.

```
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... /home/jec/sage/local/bin/pkg-config: line 16: /usr/bin/pkg-conf
ig: No such file or directory
no
checking for M4RI... no
configure: error: in `/home/jec/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/brial-0.8.4.3/src':
configure: error: The pkg-config script could not be found or is too old.  Make sure it
is in your PATH or set the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the full
path to pkg-config.
```
