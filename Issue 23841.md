# Issue 23841: Set assumptions in SymPy too when doing assume()

For a SymPy option to `solve` (#22322) we need to translate any assumptions on variables (and maybe anon. functions?) that were made using `assume` and `var('x', domain=...)`. Any SymPy operation may access the SymPy knowledge base any time. So I think this should be handled the same way as with Maxima, i.e. at the time the `assume`/`var` calls are made.

However see #22322#comment:12
So the database is idle play?

For variables, couldn't this be handled in the conversion Sage -> Sympy?

Yes, `SympyConverter:symbol()`.
